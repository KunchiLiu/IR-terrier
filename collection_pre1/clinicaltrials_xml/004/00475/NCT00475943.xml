	<brief_summary>This study examine airway close swallow prevent food liquid enter voice box lung eat drinking . It also test whether electrical stimulation muscle neck close airway would close swallowing . The long-term goal research determine feasibility new approach help patient severe life threaten swallow disorder . Healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age swallow normally may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram nasolaryngoscopy . For nasolaryngoscopy , subject 's voice box epiglottis ( flap tissue cover windpipe swallow ) examine use thin flexible tube camera attach pass nose back throat . During test , speech task sing whistle observe . The camera record movement vocal cord videotape . This procedure may repeat another time study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Electrical stimulation muscle neck : The muscle neck stimulate brief low-level electrical current see stimulation cause epiglottis fold windpipe . Stimulation may increase level feel like small shock The subject ask try muscle stimulation swallow . - Videofluoroscopy ( record swallow muscle stimulation x-ray image head ) : The head neck x-rayed subject swallow . After wire insert EMG ( see ) , marker glue tongue tube insert nose esophagus . The movement swallow without muscle stimulation x-rayed analyzed later determine stimulation affect movement epiglottis . - Electromyography ( EMG ) : Measurement electrical activity muscle neck use fine wire place skin muscle chin . - Manometry : During videofluoroscopy , manometer ( tube measure pressure ) place nose back throat entry point esophagus . This test show whether muscle stimulation fold epiglottis . - Surface electromyography ( sEMG ) : The tube use videofluoroscopy small ring embed measure muscle activity surface inside throat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Our objective determine factor cause epiglottic inversion normal deglutition attempt recreate movement mean muscle stimulation . STUDY POPULATION : We plan accrue 30 healthy volunteer set 20 participant provide reliable data analysis . DESIGN : As observational study , anatomical movement examine videofluoroscopy normal swallow stimulation thyrohyoid , geniohyoid , hyoglossus , styloglossus muscle . OUTCOME MEASURES : The principal outcome study distance epiglottal displacement measure videofluoroscopic image normal swallow muscle stimulation . Secondary measure assess correlate epiglottal inversion . These data include motion kinematics structure , hyo-laryngeal complex tongue ; tongue base retraction pressure oral-pharynx , hypopharynx , UES ; muscle activity measure surface electromyography three location .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Included subject healthy adult age 1865 year normal swallow function , determine medical history physical examination otolaryngologist . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion include follow circumstance : Subjects must history chronic swallow difficulty dysfunction . Pregnant volunteer exclude due risk associate radiation exposure . Women nursing exclude . Subjects must currently suffer psychiatric disorder depression , evidence care psychiatrist , medication treatment psychiatric disorder . History brain injury neurological disease . History epileptic seizure . History Rheumatic fever , mitral valve prolapse , heart murmur , cardiac arrhythmia determine medical history , physical EKG disqualify subject .
