The diagnosis IDA would define low hemoglobin level presence iron deficiency ( low iron level , high transferrin saturation and/or low ferritin ) . Children clinical symptom fo Helicobacter Pylori , i.e . abdominal pain , peptic ulcer etc . Children underlie chronic disease need medical treatment .</criteria>
