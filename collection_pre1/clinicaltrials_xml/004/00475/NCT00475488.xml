	<brief_summary>Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) Surgery commonly use treat patient coronary artery disease ( atherosclerosis ) relief angina ( chest pain ) improve heart muscle function . Healthy vein artery , refer 'conduits ' elsewhere patient 's body , graft ( attach ) aorta coronary artery , bypass ( via new route ) coronary artery narrowing cause atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) thereby improve blood supply myocardium ( heart muscle ) . Over year , range different vein artery around body use bypass diseased coronary artery . Typically , internal thoracic artery behind breastbone saphenous vein leg use bypass . More recently , radial artery forearm also use bypass coronary artery diseased ( atherosclerotic ) . There strong evidence indicate leave internal thoracic artery stay open long ( i.e . high patency ) achieve best health outcomes . As result , cardiac surgeon use leave internal thoracic artery first choice conduit ( vessel use bypass block artery ) . However , many patient require multiple graft little evidence graft best conduit use . It suggest radial artery might function well saphenous vein conduit . The Radial Artery Patency Clinical Outcomes Trial ( RAPCO ) aim compare patency radial artery right internal thoracic artery also saphenous vein .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radial Artery Patency Clinical Outcomes Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Department Cardiac Surgery Austin Health conduct prospective randomise trial , stratify two separate sub-studies . The first compare radial artery right internal thoracic artery ( free aorto-coronary graft ) second comparies radial artery saphenous vein graft . Each patient follow 10 year CABG surgery order ass pattern graft survival 10 year also record major clinical event . The study first give approval Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee August 18th,1995 . Enrolment commence June 1996 . Recruitment cease March 2005 . Patients randomly assign control experimental group , patient group receive left internal thoracic artery leave anterior decending ( LAD ) study graft second graft . The gold standard measure comparison conduit use post-operative angiogram . These angiogram assess patent ( open ) graft , also offer quality assurance CABG surgery perform . To spread graft patency end-points 10 year CABG , patient undergo second randomisation time graft patency assess . The timing graft study coronary angiogram weight towards end 10 year period aim 10 % 1 year , 20 % 2 year , 20 % 5 year , 30 % 7.5 year 30 % 10 year CABG surgery . Clinical data systematically collect determine patient experience heart attack , repeat surgery , balloon angioplasty death subsequent year . To enrich number mid-study graft patency end-points protocol amendment ( July 19th , 2002 ) approve allow patient offer selective coronary angiogram 5 year anniversary surgery . A protocol amendment ( November 16th , 2006 ) allow coronary graft CT angiography use optionally replace selective angiography also offer patient image 10 year , addition original pre-specified , randomised time imaging .</detailed_description>
