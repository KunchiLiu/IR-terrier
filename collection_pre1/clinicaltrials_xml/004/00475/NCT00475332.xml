	<detailed_description>Total dose deliver tumor size important predictor local control treatment low-grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) . The basic principle large nodal mass require increased dos External Beam Radiotherapy ( EBRT ) achieve local control . Radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) seem share characteristic . Review publish literature Bexxar Zevalin reveal one important predictor treatment failure nodal volume apparent relationship dose deliver RIT . The best tumor dosimetry RIT Dr. Wiseman et al report dosimetry Zevalin ( PMID:11418315 ) . He show tumor ≥15 cm^3 receive 1082 cGy Zevalin , whereas average dose deliver tumor &lt; 15 cm^3 4763 cGy . Recently , Gokhale et al ( PMID:16111589 ) publish experience Zevalin Cleveland Clinic show significant correlation pretreatment tumor volume response therapy . In experience , tumor ≥5 cm 83 % rate local recurrence versus 28 % tumor &lt; 5 cm . This dose paradox ( big mass , require dose , receive less RIT ) may diminish delivery additional EBRT . This hypothesis underlie pilot study . The dosimetric data available Bexxar heterogeneous confirms observation see Zevalin . In patient previously untreated low-grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) , Koral et al ( PMID:12621015 ) show increase likelihood achieve complete response ( CR ) tumor dose &gt; 650 cGy . Previous work author show trend large tumor volume receive less dose ( PMID:10994741 ) . The compelling data relationship come clinical trial do use Bexxar . Both pivotal trial ( PMID:11579112 ) recently publish trial treat naïve patient ( PMID:15689582 ) , tumor volume significant predictor response Bexxar . In pivotal trial , small tumor burden factor predict long duration response . Whereas EBRT might able provide reliable radiation dose , use Bexxar may provide therapeutic equivalent central lymphatic irradiation , would permit use true involved field radiotherapy . Investigators previously note increased EBRT field size associate increase short-term long-term toxicity . The toxicity associate treatment radiotherapy relate site treat , necessarily include dose limiting toxicity Bexxar , primarily hematologic transient . As toxicity RT Bexxar may overlap , combination may allow increase therapeutic window radiotherapy Bexxar therapy .</detailed_description>
