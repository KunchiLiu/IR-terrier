	<brief_summary>The goal propose research produce preliminary evidence PE OEF/OIF veteran PTSD examine cognitive , psychophysiological , neuroendocrine mechanism change PTSD treatment . In brief , 36 OEF/OIF veteran chronic PTSD PTSS least 3 month duration randomly assign 15 session either PE TAU ( see description intervention ) . All veteran receive psychobiological assessment pre treatment , mid treatment , post treatment , 3 month , 6 month follow-up . Each assessment cover 2 session separate day include interview self-report symptom ( i.e. , PTSD , depression , general anxiety severity ) , self-report PTSD-related cognition , psychophysiological ( i.e. , heart rate , skin conductance , respiration , end-tidal CO2 ) assessment neutral trauma script , assessment salivary cortisol neutral trauma script . Also , morning prior laboratory assessment , patient collect salivary cortisol moment wake 30 45 minute post-walking . In addition assessment , patient assign PE collect salivary cortisol three imaginal exposure session ( session 3 , 9 , 15 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exposure Therapy Chronic PTSD : Efficacy Mechanisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective treatment PTSD available , exposure therapy ( ET ) program , include Prolonged Exposure ( PE ) , empirical evidence effectiveness ( Rothbaum et al. , 2000 ) . However , among people receive treatment PTSD , many receive psychotherapy empirically proven efficacy . In one VA VISN , 10 % PTSD specialist therapist report use ET routinely ( Rosen et al. , 2004 ) . They suggest lack training human resource provide ET , well misconception exposure therapy may drive deficit . Training effort would substantially cost-effective proven treatment could deliver group format . Development proof efficacy group-based PE would provide far veterans access treatment truly foster recovery devastate impact PTSD . This central goal proposal . Little known mechanism PE lead recovery . Delineation mechanisms critical step towards development treatment refinement improve effectiveness efficiency treatment . We plan examine potential role cognitive , psychophysiologic neuroendocrine factor symptom improvement . The mechanistic component provide preliminary data interaction cognitive change ( increased sense self-competence control negative outcome ) , psychophysiological habituation ( reduce reactivity trauma relate stimulus ) , reduce neuroendocrine sensitivity ( reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis reactivity ) . We predict cognitive change , psychophysiological habituation reduce HPA reactivity relate symptom improvement effective treatment . Thirty-six OEF/OIF veteran chronic PTSD least 3 month duration randomly assign 15 week twice weekly PE-G TAU . All veteran receive psychobiological assessment pre treatment , mid treatment , post treatment , 3 month 6 month follow-up . Each assessment include interview self-report symptom ( i.e. , PTSD , depression , general anxiety severity ) , self-report PTSD-related cognition , psychophysiological ( i.e. , heart rate , skin conductance , respiration , end-tidal CO2 ) assessment neutral trauma script , assessment salivary cortisol neutral trauma script . Also , morning prior laboratory assessment , patient collect salivary cortisol moment wake 30 45 minute post-walking . The result study used pilot data VA Merit Award NIMH R01 application large follow-up study .</detailed_description>
