	<detailed_description>Patients implanted pacemaker currently see cardiologist every 6-12 month . Shorter follow-up interval generally see excessive workload physician , little benefit patient . Longer interval see dangerous concern device integrity safety . This scheme still result large number follow-up visit little important change pacemaker therapy . On hand , patient quicker change cardiac situation need subsequent adaptation pacemaker programming , detect properly treat standard follow-up scheme . Our clinical trial investigates efficacy safety Home Monitoring technology increase flexibility pacemaker follow-up . Home Monitoring technology allow automatic transmission via mobile phone link relevant data implant pacemaker service center . The patient 's physician access data via password-protected internet site . The regular Home Monitoring data analysis entirely replace clinical routine visit ( `` virtual clinic '' ) . Follow-up visit schedule accord result Home Monitoring data analysis . For primary endpoint , total workload pacemaker patient care virtual clinic compare standard follow-up scheme regular clinic visit . The total workload comprises time data analysis , clinical examination , patient contact . Secondary endpoint investigate adverse event rate , quality life , total cost , mirror direct patient 's expense , patient travel wait time , visit pacer clinic well additional cardiologist 's internal medicine doctor 's service . Standard vs. virtual follow-up . For standard follow-up group patient , routine follow-up visit schedule 1 month 12 month pre-discharge control , every 12 month . A follow-up 6 month discharge optional . For virtual clinic group patient , routine follow-up visit schedule 1 month pre-discharge control . The Home Monitoring data analysis perform 12 month discharge , every 12 month . If 6-month follow-up routinely do standard group clinic , 6-month Home Monitoring data analysis do well . Event report analyse within 24 hour work day .</detailed_description>
