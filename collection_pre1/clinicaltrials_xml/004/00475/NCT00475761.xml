	<brief_summary>Background : Women whose mammogram show lot dense area likely develop breast cancer cancer miss mammogram . It unclear factor lead dense breast dense breast increase risk develop breast cancer . Objectives : To determine woman breast look dense mammogram . To determine type cell tissue make dense area breast tissue may likely become cancerous . Eligibility : Women 40 65 year age breast cancer receive medicine radiation type cancer schedule undergo breast biopsy . Design : This study conduct University Vermont , collaboration NCI . Participants undergo following : - Review medical record collect last 2 year Vermont Mammography Registry . - Participation short telephone interview . - Height weight measurement . - Testing biopsy tissue collect diagnosis treatment . - Future contact regard health status 10 year , include review additional mammogram , remove tissue , questionnaire medical record collect Vermont Mammography Registry 10-year study . Participants may also undergo follow optional procedure : - Provide mouthwash sample genetic testing . - Provide blood sample test marker dense mammogram breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High breast density age strong risk factor sporadic breast cancer among woman . Although glandular epithelium contributes mammographic density , non-epithelial tissue component represent major determinant : adipose tissue radiolucent fibrous tissue dense . The hypothesis epidemiologic factor associate elevate breast density alter breast microenvironment ( ME ) ( defined cell structure surround luminal glandular cell include : myoepithelial cell ; basement membrane , stromal fibroblast myofibroblasts ; endothelial cell pericytes ; inflammatory cell , collagen , matrix protein , growth factor , hormone , biochemical component ) manner enhances dysregulated proliferation breast epithelium ultimately cancer . Specifically , Investigators propose epidemiologic factor lead increase exposure hormone inflammatory mediator alter ME , lead increase breast density cancer . The critical importance ME carcinogenesis support experimental clinical data show epithelial abnormality alone generally insufficient cancer development without concurrent change ME . The primary aim pilot study demonstrate feasibility collect data need elucidate biologic mechanism mediate substantial breast cancer risk associate high mammographic density . Specifically , Investigators develop , fine tune , validate complex cross-sectional study protocol collect risk factor data biological specimen ( blood , buccal cell , tissue fluid , tissue ) require discover mechanisms biomarkers link high mammographic density ( measure quantitatively use computerize method ) breast cancer risk . They enroll 250 woman age 40 65 year undergo radiologically guide biopsy University Vermont , large center within Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System ( VBCSS ) , participate pilot study mammographic density .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion participation study woman , age 4065 year age , undergo radiologicallyguided biopsy ( stereotactic ultrasoundguided ) . We NOT exclude subject current past use exogenous hormone ; prior hysterectomy salpingoophorectomy presentation breast mass . Although biopsy prompt radiologic finding ( typically abnormal calcification mass ) , biopsy perform symptom unassociated radiologic finding , nipple discharge , palpable mass , discomfort , etc . Elevated density per se biopsy indication . ALL woman refer radiologically guide biopsy , irrespective indication , consider eligible pilot study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We EXCLUDE woman prior history breast cancer , EXCISIONAL breast biopsy within one year , woman implant place , woman take tamoxifen raloxifene chemoprevention woman receive nonsurgical treatment cancer organ .</criteria>
