	<brief_title>Sweetened Beverages Food Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rise prevalence obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus link increased consumption sugar- particularly fructose-sweetened beverage . Preliminary evidence suggests could partly explain fact reduction intake solid food inadequate compensate additional energy take beverage . In addition , type sugar use sweeten beverage might considerable impact body 's ability adjust food intake properly . In particular , consumption fructose report reduce diurnal plasma glucose , insulin , leptin concentration , increase diurnal ghrelin concentration compare isocaloric amount glucose . As plasma concentration glucose , insulin , leptin , ghrelin involve regulation food intake energy expenditure , might impair longer-term ability body match food intake energy expenditure stabilize body weight . To investigate whether regular consumption fructose-sweetened beverage lead increase total energy intake , investigator enroll healthy normal-weight subject control diet study use double-blind randomized cross-over design . Each subject complete three diet period : solid food plus beverage sweeten fructose ( A ) , solid food plus beverage sweeten glucose ( B ) , solid food plus beverage sweeten non-caloric sweetener ( C ) . During period , subject provide food 8 day . These diet consist meal freshly prepare use regular food item typically find American diet . Solid food provide excess subject estimate require . Subjects ask eat much food need feel comfortably satiate , return excess food Nutrition Research Kitchen University Washington ( UW ) General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . This return food weigh assess precisely amount type food eaten subject day diet period . In addition solid food , subject ask drink certain amount lemonade sweeten either fructose ( A ) , glucose ( B ) , non-caloric sweetener ( C ) . In group A B , subject consume 25 % estimate daily calorie requirement form sugar sweeten beverage , drink period C volume . Subjects admit GCRC morning day 9 diet period measurement rest metabolic rate mean indirect calorimetry blood draws measurement fast plasma concentration adipogenic hormone plasma lipid . Furthermore , administer standardize breakfast draw blood 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minute meal measure postprandial plasma concentration insulin , ghrelin , satiety signal . Following last postprandial blood draw , serve another meal measure ad libitum food intake . Our hypothesis subject appetite consume food consume fructose-sweetened beverage 8 day . Primary outcome measure study total energy consume period A , B , C ; reduction intake solid food period A B compare period C ; energy uptake ad libitum meal serve day 9 diet period . Secondary outcome measure rest energy expenditure plasma concentration satiety adiposity signal .</detailed_description>
