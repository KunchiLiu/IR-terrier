	<brief_summary>Experiments suggest low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) inhibit tumor growth metastasis . Studies humans suggest LMWH associate high survival patient cancer relate thrombosis . Two recent study suggest LMWH may increase survival patient cancer associate thrombosis . The purpose study assess effect LMWH overall survival patient localize non-small cell lung cancer complete surgical resection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase III , prospective , multicentric , randomize , control , open trial parallel group blind adjudication end-point criterion . Reference therapy : Patients randomize control group receive postoperative treatment accord local practice participate center . However , participate center comply follow guideline . Adjuvant chemotherapy : Adjuvant chemotherapy offer patient stage II stage IIIA cancer . Adjuvant chemotherapy platin base include two drug maximum 4 cycle . Each center select one regimen begin study patient include study . Preoperative chemotherapy : Patients chemotherapy surgery include study provide complete surgical resection . In case tumor stage stratification pathologic stage assess surgery . Stage I cancer : Patients stage I cancer select postoperative chemotherapy include study . Contraindication chemotherapy Patients contraindication postoperative chemotherapy refuse chemotherapy include study provide fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion . Experimental treatment : Experimental treatment tinzaparin administer subcutaneously day dose 100 IU/Kg twelve week period begin maximum period 8 week surgery . Patients randomized experimental group receive adjuvant postoperative treatment accord local practice guideline control group . - Patient follow-up : All patient follow accord local practice , least two outpatient visit chest radiograph plan year three year follow-up period last inclusion . - Duration trial : Inclusion period ( first patient last patient ) : 6 year . Patient total follow-up ( surgery end follow-up ) : 3 year last inclusion ( first enrol patient follow 9 year ) . Total study period : 9 year .</detailed_description>
