	<brief_title>Haploidentical Transplantation Patients With Acute Leukemia Myelodysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients : The major risk use stem cell donor perfect match HLA antigens severe graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD condition happen donor 's T-cells , immune system cell find transplanted stem cell , react cell patient receive transplant . This cause serious possibly life-threatening side effect . Severe GVHD also continue long time . This call `` chronic GVHD . '' Chronic GVHD result skin , liver , intestinal problem , well health-threatening complication . In order low risk GVHD , number T-cells donate stem cell lower . T-cells important part immune system fight infection cancer cell . While lower number T-cells help lower chance GVHD transplant stem cell match perfectly , take long time build number T-cells body . Researchers want find treating donated stem cell anti-B7 antibody , transplant , help low chance GVHD still help speed process build T-cells . Anti-B7 antibody proteins attach immune system cell interfere immune response . This may help keep transplanted T-cells attack cell body . Small group people enrol step trial . The first group ( 8 participant ) give certain number anti-B7 antibody treat donor immune cell . If manageable side effect , next small group people enrol receive high number donor immune cell . This increase number group people continue study doctor find high number anti-B7 antibody treat donor immune cell give without cause severe unmanageable side effect . The initial group patient ( 3 5 patient ) enter study receive small number donor immune cell . This phase study help cell process laboratory determine technique procedure work correctly proceed high dos immune cell next patient participate study . You central venous catheter ( CVC ) insert , daily blood draw daily medicine fluid give without extra `` needle stick '' IV line . The CVC needle tube insert vein chest back , stay whole time treatment . You give separate form explain procedure . Your surgeon anesthesiologist review . Your stem cell donor ask sign consent form , stem cell collect process call leukapheresis . Once enough stem cell collect donor , begin treatment total body irradiation ( TBI ) , follow chemotherapy . This treatment generally refer either `` conditioning '' `` preparative '' therapy . It give order kill leukemia cell , well stem cell , immune cell . The TBI give 2 time day 3 day , last 20-40 minute time . All chemotherapy give intravenously ( IV -- needle vein ) , usually CVC . You receive chemotherapy drug thiotepa day 2 day , fludarabine day 5 day , anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) day 4 day . Methylprednisolone , steroid drug , give ATG low risk side effect . After radiation chemotherapy treatment , receive transplant donor 's normal T-cell deplete stem cell IV CVC . If donor cell use transplant , leftover cell store . The leftover store cell thrown away doctor decides need . After 10 year , Cell Processing Laboratory M. D. Anderson throw away remain stored cell . The stem cell transplant 2 part : first infusion normal donor stem cell , infusion stem cell treat anti-B7 antibody . In order perform treatment anti-B7 antibody , T-cells must collect blood person donate stem cell either family member share genetic tissue typing . If cell come family member , collect 32 day transplant . If donate cell purpose , collect conditioning treatment start , cell freeze , store , thaw Day 32 transplant . The donor immune cell cell family member share tissue type take laboratory mixed anti-B7 antibody Day 32 . The mixture keep laboratory 3 day . Adding anti-B7 antibody mixture stem cell keep certain interaction two cell type happen . Researchers believe `` teach '' donor 's immune cell kinds cell leave alone donor cell put back body . The anti-B7 antibody rinse away mixture , cell give IV infusion Day 35 transplant . If infusion need put base medical condition , cell collect Day 39 give Day 42 . Throughout stay hospital , 4-6 week , blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) physical exam often perform . Depending clinical condition , test , include radiologic scan and/or biopsy , may also need . These discuss needed . After send home hospital , ask come back clinic several time . The frequency visit determine part clinical condition . You may need come often every day 3 month . At visit , physical exam , blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) , check-up GVHD do . Most test related regular medical care , blood test relate study . Whenever possible , study blood test collect time blood drawn routine test . Your size blood count help study staff decide correct amount blood draw ( 6 teaspoon time ) . These sample freeze store used study test . You study 1 year . This time include screen visit , treatment transplant , follow-up visit transplant . After able return home physician , study staff contact every 3 month 2 year transplant , see . You ask return program 6 month , 1 year , 2 year transplant . At follow visit , study staff collect information doctor ' note medical record . This information include transplant side effect , treatment , information obtain procedure , include lab test , scan , biopsy . The study staff collect health information end research . They may collect follow-up information , disease status , treatment receive , medical record even direct participation research study end . This investigational study . The treatment study authorize use research . Up 40 patient take part multicenter study . About 20 enrol M. D. Anderson . Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ( PBMC ) Collection Family Donors : Your family member receive stem cell transplant certain type cell call lymphocyte remove . This do help prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) patient , may also lower ability donate stem cell fight infection . The transplant treatment use family member involve collect stem cell peripheral blood person family act stem cell donor . During process collect donor peripheral blood stem cell , large number T lymphocyte ( `` T-cells '' ) also collect . Because donor T-cells cause GVHD person receive transplant , stem cell collect purify low number T-cells . This may lower risk GVHD . This procedure call T-cell depletion . The stem cell , minus T-cells , give patient . The side effect remove T cell , however , may high risk infection . Researchers want give patient another infusion extra blood cell contain T-cells , 5 week transplant . Before give cell , study staff add anti-B7 antibody , try low chance cause GVHD give . To change cell way , researcher need blood cell family member , mix donor 's T-cells . You ask provide extra cell , mixed anti-B7 antibody . If decide take part blood donor , first physical exam blood test ( less 3 tablespoon ) perform make sure healthy enough donate . These blood test include routine test , test kidney liver function , test , depend upon health history . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test donate blood study . Your blood sample also test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , virus cause AIDS . You right know result test , notify privately HIV test positive . What test result mean explain member medical staff . If find HIV positive , eligible donor , may safe patient . You also test syphilis , hepatitis , viral disease could pass patient donate blood cell . You right know result test . Any unusual test result discuss member medical staff . If still able take part study , collection circulate blood happen Day 32 ( case , Day 39 ) patient 's stem cell transplant . The number T-cells give family member decide enters study . If family member give small moderate number T-cells , process collect blood immune cell involve placement intravenous ( IV ) needle vein arm drawing blood . The amount blood may little 2 tablespoon much 7-12 tablespoon . If family member receive large possible number T-cells , possible researcher need use pheresis machine collect enough blood immune cell . Apheresis process use collect blood cell use technique similar platelet collection . Apheresis require IV needle place arm procedure , central venous catheter ( CVC ) place large vein surgeon . If CVC need , give separate inform consent document , explain procedure risk . The blood drawn , process machine separate cell need , remain blood part return second IV port catheter . No medication require collection , procedure would do single day . Your participation start screen test , patient 's transplant . The blood cell collect Day 32 ( 39 ) transplant . This end participation main part study . You stop participation time . Your doctor also stop participation study time , best interest . This investigational study . The treatment study authorize use research . About 37 patient take part study . About 20 enrol M. D. Anderson . Stem Cell Mobilization Collection Family Donors : This study look use mismatch , related donor source stem cell immune cell transplantation patient acute leukemias myelodysplastic syndrome . You ask donate blood stem cell immune cell ( T-lymphocytes , also call T-cells ) . The circulate blood contains stem cell basis blood immune system . Drugs use increase number stem cell blood high enough number transplantation . Stem cell take circulate blood donate , give family member . Your healthy stem cell replace family member 's bone marrow help fight his/her disease . During process blood stem cell collection , large number T-cells also collect . Sometimes immune system cell actually `` attack '' person 're give . This call `` graft versus host disease '' ( GVHD ) . Your blood stem cell purify , number T-cells lower . This help low risk GVHD . This call `` T-cell depletion . '' The second part study involve donate blood cell another donor . Removing T-cells donated stem cell may raise risk patient get infection . To prevent , ask donate blood stem cell month first transplant . These stem cell mixed T-cells another donor treat anti-B7 antibody . Researchers want find mixture low risk GVHD `` teach '' T-cells attack patient 's cell . If agree take part study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You physical exam blood test ( less 3 tablespoon ) make sure healthy enough donate . These blood test include routine test , test liver kidney function , possibly test , base upon health history . Women able child must also negative blood pregnancy test take part study . Your blood test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , virus cause AIDS . You right know result test , notify privately HIV test positive . What test result mean explain member medical staff . If find HIV positive , eligible donor may safe patient . You also test syphilis , hepatitis , viral disease could pass patient donate blood . You right know result test . Any abnormal test result discuss member medical staff . If still eligible take part study , begin drug treatment stem cell collection . You ask inject morning 4-6 day drug call filgrastim ( G-CSF , Neupogen ) . Filgrastim protein cause bone marrow make stem cell . A nurse train professional clinic teach inject Filgrastim skin . The first dose filgrastim must give clinic , study staff watch side effect . Blood sample ( 4 teaspoon ) draw Day 4 filgrastim injection , check white blood cell count level . These blood test happen every day stem cell collection do . Based result blood test , dose filgrastim may change . On Day 4 5 filgrastim treatment , blood stem cell collection start . Blood stem cell collect use process call apheresis . Apheresis use technique similar platelet collection . Apheresis require IV needle place arm procedure , central venous catheter ( CVC ) place large vein surgeon . If CVC need , give separate inform consent document , explain procedure risk . The blood drawn , process machine separate cell need , remain blood part return second IV port catheter . The collection may take 4 day , though usually take 1-2 day collect enough stem cell . If enough cell collect time , study staff look another donor . Your T-cells later collect Day 32 patient 's stem cell transplant . Before donate T-cells , go screen test , must infections medical condition would health risk person receive blood . About 2 tablespoon blood drawn test . The number T cell give family member decide enter study . If family member give small moderate number T-cells , process collect blood immune cell involve placement intravenous ( IV ) needle vein arm drawing blood . The amount blood may little 4 tablespoon much 7-12 tablespoon . If family member receive large possible number T-cells , possible researcher need perform apheresis , collect enough blood immune cell . However , would need take filgrastim drug collection , apheresis would limited single day . If stem cell grow well patient , doctor may ask stem cell within first month patient 's treatment , effort improve growth stem cell well treat patient 's disease . You stop participation time . Tell study doctor think stop decide stop . Your doctor also stop participation study time , best interest . This investigational study . Filgrastim FDA approve drug . Apheresis standard procedure blood platelet donor stem cell donor . It important tell study doctor injure take part study . About 37 patient take part study . About 20 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
