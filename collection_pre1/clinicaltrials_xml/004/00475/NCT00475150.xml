	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Relapsed , Refractory , Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate objective response rate patient relapse , refractory , untreated acute myeloid leukemia high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome treat AZD2171 ( cediranib maleate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity drug patient . II . Determine response duration , event-free survival , overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine hematological response rate patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( acute myeloid leukemia v myelodysplastic syndrome ) . Patients receive oral cediranib maleate daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy baseline day 28 correlative study . Samples analyze circulate endothelial cell , VEGF receptor expression , leukemic blast via flow cytometry microvessel density via histopathological technique . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
