	<detailed_description>JUSTIFICATION Between 10-20 % 6000 case cervical spinal cord injury see annually North America clinical pattern traumatic central cord syndrome ( TCCS ) . These patient usually older , likely sustain fall , incomplete spinal cord injury characterize dysesthetic weak upper extremity . CT scan cervical spine patient TCCS often show disc/osteophytes complex superimpose degenerative congenital spinal stenosis MRI reveal signal change one multiple skeletal segment . A minority patient suffer fracture/subluxations , however , patient young involved dynamic trauma . Since 1951 , Schneider et al report syndrome , controversy confusion dominate surgical management . The current `` Guidelines Management Acute Cervical Spine Spinal Cord Injuries '' recommendation level option , since prospective outcome data unavailable . During past four decade , significant progress understand pathophysiological mechanism govern traumatic spinal cord injury include central cord syndrome . Translation kinetic energy , primarily hyperextension less often fracture dislocation cervical spine , usually involved cervical spondylosis congenital spinal stenosis , result anatomical compression spinal cord follow secondary insult time dependent likely ischemic nature . Microangiographic study spinal cord patient cervical spondylosis indicate deformation , stretch flatten spinal cord tracts well sulcal microvasculature , may jeopardize traumatic hyperextension , result axonal interruption , swell vascular damage , predispose sustain spinal cord ischemia responsible clinical manifestation central cord syndrome . HYPOTHESIS : acute traumatic central cord syndrome , surgical decompression spinal cord within 1-5 day result rapid motor functional recovery result well quality life decompression ~6 week follow injury . To test hypothesis , pursue follow specific aim : SPECIFIC AIM I : To compare American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) Motor Scores three 12 month post injury patient central cord syndrome operate within 1-5 day injury similar group patient operate ~6 week ( range 5-7 week ) follow trauma . SPECIFIC AIM II : To compare functional outcome , health relate quality life posttraumatic syrinx size three 12 month injury patient traumatic central cord syndrome operate within 1-5 day similar group patient operate ~6 week ( 5-7 week ) follow injury . DESIGN/PROCEDURE Our investigation single center prospective randomize pilot study . Thirty conscious adult ( &gt; 17 year old ) patient clinically ( conventional ASIA exam ) radiologically ( conventional MRI CT neck ) proven cervical traumatic central cord syndrome screen study . These patient admit University Maryland Medical System within 48 hour injury randomize ( computer ) two surgical group . Study subject fully resuscitate , stable eligible sign consent go research process . None patient radiologically overt unstable cervical spine injury injury require urgent surgical decompression stabilization . A computer design random number generator divide patient two standard care surgical group : Early Surgical Decompression Group ( ( ESDG [ odd # ] ) ) surgery 1-5 day trauma late surgical decompression group ( ( LSDG [ even # ] ) ) operate period ~ 6 week ( range 5-7 week ) . Unless medically indicate stay acute care facility , LSD Group patient discharge rehab facility home bring back surgery . While hard collar latter group study CT neck 3 week ( design research tool ) order assure miss ligamentous injury result glacial instability . If hidden instability discover , depend severity , decompression internal fixation may perform early propose 6 week . Both group detail conventional medical , neurological radiological examination hospital stay rehab center , 3 month , 6 month 12 month postinjury . All study clinically conventional except MRI 12 month post injury research related measure size spinal cord syrinx . While ready discharge rehab center 3 12 month post injury patient detail research related functional study depict study schedule form know outcome measure ( Functional Independence Measure , Spinal Cord Independence Measure , Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury ) . In study wo n't placebo control group . Procedure 1 . PREHOSPITAL , Trauma Resuscitation Unit ( TRU ) &amp; Emergency Department ( ED ) RESUSCITATION : In two-year period , patient admit STC TRU UMMS EDs , within 48 hour spinal cord injury , screen evidence acute traumatic central cord syndrome ( TCCS ) . 2 . SCREENING : Patients incomplete spinal cord injury MRI evidence spinal cord compression swell visit complete conventional American Spinal Injury Association Neurological Functional Classification motor , sensory deficit . Those ASIA Impairment Grades B , C D/E clinical picture central cord syndrome choose possible enrollment . Inclusion/Exclusion Check List complete . 3 . RANDOMIZATION : We ( PI designee ) use one computer program generate random number order divide 30 patient two group surgical candidate ( Nregnow/digital river Chicago IL 60695-0001 ) . Odd number use early ( 1-5 day ) decompression even number late ( ( 6 week [ 5-7 week ] ) ) decompression . The software set manner single number generate single patient specific alphanumerical user code ( CCSS3001-CCSS3030 ) . Generation random number accomplish PI designee . Randomization part research process . 4 . TIMING OF DECOMPRESSION : Based feasibility study Tator et al STASCIS 1 ( please see re protocol ) , decide set timing decompression five day ( 1-5 day ) six week ( 5-7weeks ) order able capture eligible patient . Enrollment within 48 hour injury . If due reason ( ) ( e.g . complication ) patient randomize early surgery get operate , still follow `` intent treat patient '' his/her outcome analyze . The true patient late surgery due specific reason surgery cancel . 5 . OPERATIVE INTERVENTION : Eligible patient traumatic central cord syndrome , canal compromise spinal cord compression consent , randomize two group . Thirty patient ( 15 patient group ) undergo standard surgical decompression spinal cord either within first five day 6 week follow spinal cord injury . Each 15 patient enrol late decompression keep hard collar rehab facility undergo research relate CT study 3 week post admission . If interim image study indicate glacial translation , early decompression internal fixation may consider . The choice surgical technique decompression standard treatment Shock Trauma Center . Standard surgical decompression spinal cord select group Department Neurosurgery staff full familiarity cervical spine surgical intervention . 6 . FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS : Before , immediately 72 hour follow surgery , discharge acute care rehab center , 6 week , 3 , 6 , and12 month post injury patient complete conventional ASIA motor sensory classification examination . Patients enrol early surgical group stay critical care intermediate care unit , general floor discharge rehabilitation center . These patient conventional postoperative CT inpatient , 3 12 month post injury . A research relate CT ( 3 week ) perform late surgery group order evaluate stability sagittal plane cervical spine . Conventional MRI perform immediately follow surgery every patient study 12 month ( research relate MRI ) evaluate size spinal cord syrinx . SF-36 , Functional Independence Scale ( FIM ) , Walking Index SCI ( WISCI ) , Spinal Cord Independence Measure ( SCIM ) , check outcome measure research instrument discharge rehab facility , 3 month , 12 month follow injury patient . Patients randomized decompression 6 week external fixation hard collar transfer rehabilitation center home six week bring back surgical decompression . Follow-up patient identical early operative group . 7 . OUTCOME INSTRUMENTS American Spinal Injury Association Motor Score Classification : ASIA Motor Score . American Spinal Injury Sensory Score Classification : ASIA Sensory Score . ASIA impairment Score ( A , B , C , D , E ) Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) Spinal Cord Independence Measure ( SCIM ) . Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury ( WISCI ) . Health Related Quality Life measure SF-36 . CT evaluation cervical spinal cord injury accord Allen-Ferguson Mechanistic Classification . CT quantification canal compromise accord formula Fehlings et al . MRI evidence spinal cord compression damage syrinx size specify interval .</detailed_description>
