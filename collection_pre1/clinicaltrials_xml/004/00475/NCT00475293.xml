	<brief_title>Panitumumab Combination With Irinotecan Chemotherapy 2nd-line Therapy Subjects With mCRC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aside limited case resectable metastatic disease , mCRC cure currently available chemotherapy regimen , continue need improve current treatment . Panitumumab demonstrate objective tumour response , increase progression free survival acceptable safety profile clinical study patient metastatic colorectal cancer use monotherapy combination irinotecan ( Meropol et al , 2003 ; Berlin et al , 2004 ; Hecht et al , 2004 ; Malik et al , 2005 ) . The addition panitumumab chemotherapy expect enhance treatment effect chemotherapy . This Phase II , single-arm , multi-centre study . Eligible subject enrol treat second-line combination therapy consist panitumumab irinotecan . Prior study entry order confirm eligibility , investigator designee review exist radiological image addition relevant clinical document ( report , note , etc . ) ensure subject fail relapsed one prior chemotherapy regimen . Panitumumab administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion dose 9 mg/kg Q3W . Irinotecan chemotherapy ( 350 mg/m2 ) administer administration panitumumab . Subjects permit receive panitumumab chemotherapy develop disease progression ( PD ) experience unacceptable toxicity . Subjects discontinue irinotecan , example due toxicity , permit receive panitumumab monotherapy . After discontinuation panitumumab , treatment period end subject attend safety follow-up visit 56 ±3 day later . Tumour response assessment perform investigator per modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( m-RECIST ) . Subjects evaluate tumour response every 9 week ± 1 week PD withdrawal trial . Responding disease confirm less 28 day criterion response first meet . Subjects symptoms suggestive PD evaluate tumour progression time symptom occur . Subjects complete EQ-5D PRO questionnaire every 6 week ± 1 week , baseline end treatment period safety follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
