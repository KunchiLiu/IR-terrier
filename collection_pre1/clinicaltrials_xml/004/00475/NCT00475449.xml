	<brief_summary>This study compare two different method restore blood flow heart narrow blockage blood vessel supply heart . Currently two different way restore blood flow . One heart surgery surgeon operate directly heart , incision breast bone ( sternum ) take segment patient ’ ( non-essential ) vein arteries us bypass block narrowed segment coronary artery . This way additional blood “ pip ” heart muscle wall . The second method coronary angioplasty stent implantation . Coronary angioplasty non-surgical method perform local anaesthetic . During angioplasty special balloon advance site coronary narrowing , inflated make expand action remove narrow . This simple less invasive surgery value limit tendency narrowing reoccur ( restenosis ) six month follow treatment . When happen repeat procedure often perform . To reduce incidence restenosis coronary stent implant . These tubular metal scaffold device place inside coronary artery site previous narrow help keep artery open . These device usually deliver angioplasty balloon expand place . Both treatment equally effective prevent death subsequent myocardial infarction doctor happy recommend either option . Angioplasty offer simple initial procedure chance need repeat performance . Bypass surgery represent significant initial undertaking longer recovery convalescent period case , provide good relief symptom . Patient preference play important part decision process . Bypass graft currently therapy frequently perform world-wide . Angioplasty number important advantage need repeat procedure currently limit appeal . Since trial perform important advance angioplasty technique . Prominent amongst development use Coronary Stents show ( clinical trial ) reduce need repeat procedure initial angioplasty . Consequently stent implantation routine use world wide . If angioplasty perform coronary stent implantation may reduce need repeat procedure address principal factor currently limit value approach . If result find good bypass grafting patient could benefit short hospital stay , less traumatic operation short recovery period . We therefore wish compare outcomes patient treat ) bypass graft b ) angioplasty coronary stent implantation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written inform consent . Patient typical angina pectoris stable unstable symptom . Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease demonstrate selective coronary angiography significant lesion present least two principal epicardial vessel system . Revascularisation procedure clinically indicate . Nominated trial surgeon accept patient CABG . Nominated trial interventionist accept patient PTCA stent . At least one identify lesion suitable targeted primary stent implantation . A procedure completion either revascularisation strategy perform within 6 week randomisation . Previous CABG procedure thoracotomy . Previous coronary interventional procedure ( type ) . Intervention cardiac valve schedule index revascularisation procedure . Excision intervention myocardium schedule index revascularisation procedure . Intervention great vessel , carotid artery aorta schedule index revascularisation procedure . Absent autologous graft material . Noncardiac disease influence survival . Acute myocardial infarction 48 hour precede propose revascularisation procedure . Participation study would involve deviation routine local management revascularisation procedure . Allergy antiplatelet agent local use . Language communication barrier . Followup two year possible / Patient unreliable .</criteria>
