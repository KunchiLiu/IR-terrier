	<detailed_description>This randomize control trial aim evaluate effectiveness DID compare standard education approach order help patient Type 1 diabetes estimate carbohydrate food adjust insulin dos . It involve individual Type 1 diabetes habitually use carbohydrate counting . They test blood sugar level least 3 time day , use multiple daily injection short-acting long-acting insulin analogue , HbA1c 7.5 % 10 % familiar use mobile phone posse personal SIM card . Patients randomized standard education programme run 4 full day 4 week period DID programme run three 2-hour session two-week period . The DID novel software programme instal patient 's mobile telephone .
