	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether abatacept prevent relapse patient ANCA associate vasculitis ( AAV ) . This randomise double blind placebo control trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abatacept ANCA Associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug normally use treat patient AAV quite effective , 20 % patient relapse within 18 month . The drug use also significant side effect . Abatacept , also know CTLA4Ig , act block vital costimulatory signal require T lymphocytes activate . As ANCA associate vasculitis believe autoimmune condition dependent autoreactive T cell , reason believe drug would effective . Abatacept already receive license FDA use Rheumatoid arthritis proven effective even patient unresponsive Etanercept ( TNF blockade ) . 120 patient AAV invite take part study , hospital UK Europe . The patient receive standard therapy methotrexate steroid well 12 month abatacept placebo . They follow 12 month . The primary objective study ass relapse rate 24 month , patient acute AAV , present first diagnosis relapse , two arm study .</detailed_description>
