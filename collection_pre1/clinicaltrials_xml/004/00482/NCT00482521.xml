	<brief_title>CC-4047 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Did Not Respond Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose CC-4047 patient advanced refractory solid tumor . Secondary - Assess safety drug patient . - Assess antitumor activity drug patient . - Determine effect drug fetal hemoglobin level patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , uncontrolled , nonrandomized , dose-escalation , multicenter study . - Treatment phase ( course 1 ) : Patients receive oral CC-4047 daily day 1-21 follow 7-day recovery period . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CC-4047 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . Patients clinical evidence progressive disease DLT course 1 continue study treatment extension phase . Patients develop DLT course 1 may continue study treatment discretion investigator . - Extension phase : Patients continue take CC-4047 assign cohort dose course 1 . Patients tolerate treatment-phase dose high MTD continue treatment MTD . Courses repeat every 28 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection baseline periodically study evaluate fetal hemoglobin level . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
