	<brief_title>Phase II Poor Risk Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) Total Lymphoid Irradiation ( TLI ) Antithymocyte Globulin ( ATG ) Followed Matched Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation Consolidation Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation ( AHCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This purpose clinical trial develop alternative treatment patient relapse diffuse large B cell lymphoma likely cured conventional transplantation regimen . This study test tandem transplant approach start transplantation patient 's hematopoietic ( blood ) cell ( AHCT ) preparation allogeneic transplantation whereby blood cell match donor use try support patient 's immune system fight cancer cell . A novel combination lymphoma-specific radiation impact lymphoid organ ( lymph node spleen ) immune suppress drug give prepare patient body receive donor 's cell . This condition regimen use show reduce likelihood common side-effect , know graft versus host disease , negative reaction donor 's cell patient 's tissue . By carefully prepare patient immune-based strategy , hop improvement event-free survival reduction risk disease relapse AHCT see .</detailed_description>
