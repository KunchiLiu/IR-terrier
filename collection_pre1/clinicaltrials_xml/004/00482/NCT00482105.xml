	<brief_summary>This study divide distinct sample collection analysis phase . In sample collection phase investigator tape strip lesion designate biopsy suspect melanoma . No biopsy take solely support study ; rather patient present lesion biopsied—in context standard care—will enrol study lesion ( ) tape strip biopsy procedure . In second phase study , tape strip sample extract RNA purify expression profile DNA microarray . The gene expression data correlate histopathology expectation expression classifier distinguishes suspect lesion melanoma define . That classifier validate future study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-center study , sponsor Derm Tech ( DTI ) International . Specific Aims study This research study propose use non-invasive method capture superficial cell pigment skin lesion suspect early melanoma . This non-invasive `` biopsy '' technology develop patented DermTech International . RNA skin cell capture method profile order diagnose nature lesion ( i.e . malignant melanoma ) . A successful outcome proposal would create candidate non-invasive diagnostic assay base gene expression profile identify early stage melanoma . This assay particular diagnostic gene expression profile consider candidate profile would validate ( i.e . proven diagnostic ) large clinical trial . Secondary outcome could include test diagnosis prognosis variety pigment skin lesion . Specific Aim 1 : To create sample set pigment skin lesion . Each sample consist : 1 . RNA recover tape strip superficial epidermis overlie lesion ( tape stripping also use recover RNA normal skin area benign nevi control ) . 2 . A standard biopsy lesion accompany histology diagnosis . Biopsies would take tape strip subject standard histopathologic analysis , would provide `` gold standard '' diagnosis . These diagnosis could correlate data generate Specific Aim 2 . This specific aim compose three individual aim : 1 . Analysis select lesion RNA sample DNA microarray . 2 . Correlation gene expression data histopathology . 3 . Creation candidate expression classifier diagnosis melanoma . Tape strip ( commercialize method RNA recovery Epidermal Genetic Information Retrieval EGIR™ ) non-invasive method allow recovery cell comprise associate upper epidermis [ 4 ] . The feasibility non-invasive sample human epidermis sequential adhesive tape strip show Morhenn et al [ 4 ] . Their work show tape strip skin yield sufficient RNA analysis ribonuclease protection assay detect specific RNA specie , include know low abundance . 4 . Therapeutically remove tissue collect Tape-stripping procedure perform biopsy procedure . The tape apply site briskly rub blunt rounded end marker plastic test tube circular motion . A minimum 15 circular motion must complete tape remove . To accommodate fact many site small diameter tape , care take apply tape lesion control site surround normal epidermis . The border lesion demarcate tape surgical marker ; tape process RNA extraction , mark allow removal tape contact lesion ( might harbor normal epidermis ) . A total 4 tape use sample site great equal 6 mm diameter . Preliminary data obtain DTI show lesion less 6 mm diameter may require 8 tape recover RNA . Tape strip also perform one normal appear skin area ( preferably ; upper back mastoid process ) well one benign nevus ( available ) use comparison . After sample , tape store -20oC . The tape ship DTI dry ice , express mail , analysis . Biopsy After tape-stripping procedure complete , whole lesion surgically excise accord standard clinical practice . The biopsy standard care procedure would conduct regardless research . All tissue remove fixed formalin send histopathology laboratory , embed paraffin section histopathological analysis . Pathology result collect distinguish diagnosis . The subject pathology report identify assign unique subject identifier prior use study protect subject identity .</detailed_description>
