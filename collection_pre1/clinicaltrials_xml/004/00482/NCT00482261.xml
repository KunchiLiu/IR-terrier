	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether combination low dose lenalidomide ( 10mg ) + dexamethasone equally effective treat relapsed/refractory myeloma group elderly patient patient risk myelosuppression , whilst produce less side effect , especially myelosuppression compare high dose lenalidomide 25mg used MM-009 MM-010 trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Low Dose Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma Patients High Risk Myelosuppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide proven efficacy myeloma . In Phase I study lenalidomide monotherapy , responses observed dos 5mg , 10mg 25mg . The dose limiting toxicity lenalidomide monotherapy myelosuppression· In International MM-010 MM-009 study , lenalidomide administer 25mg d1-d21 ( pulse dexamethasone ) 28 day cycle . Although overall response rate time progression impressive , significant toxicity myelosuppression . The average age 2 study approximately 63 year , 7 year low median age myeloma . The median number prior therapy 2 . Thus , lenalidomide therapy optimally apply old and/or heavily pre-treated population , simpler , less toxic regimen would valuable . Low dose ( 15mg ) lenalidomide ( Rev-Lite ) dexamethasone may achieve goal· Based analysis MM009 MM010 data patient high risk myelosuppression subsequent dose reduction age 60 year ( approx 30 % risk increase approx 50 % 70 year ) .It hypothesize patient low base-line platelet may also high risk lenalidomide-induced myelosuppression . Little known lenalidomide tolerance patient impaired renal function , consequently patient relatively poorer renal function also enrol study .</detailed_description>
