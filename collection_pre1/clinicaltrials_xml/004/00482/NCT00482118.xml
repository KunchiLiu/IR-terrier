	<brief_summary>Background : - Women Xuan Wei County , China , almost non-smokers , yet high lung cancer rate country . - Non-smoking woman Xuan Wei use smoky coal cook heat home inhale 10 time high level polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH , compound form many burn organic substance , include smoky coal ) someone smoke 20 cigarette day . Objectives : - Determine health effect smoky coal Xuan Wei Fu Yuan counties China 's Yun Nan Province - Determine different level exposure smoky coal type fuel affect amount smoky coal emission absorb body - Determine genetic risk factor lung cancer study population determine interact smoky coal PAH exposure . Eligibility : - Women Xuan Wei Fu Yuan counties 18 79 year age lung cancer use smoky coal - Women Xuan Wei Fu Yuan counties 18 79 year age lung cancer use smoky coal Design : -Exposure assessment study user smoky coal - 150 household Use air badge , monitor , dermal badge determine subject ' exposure smoky coal Collection blood , urine , cheek cell sputum sample measure amount smoky coal emission absorb body evaluate type biologic change cause Interview subject health family history , occupational exposure , lifestyle factor ( e.g. , tobacco smoking diet ) , inherited difference gene -Case-control study - 1,000 woman Collection blood , urine , cheek cell sputum sample measure amount smoky coal emission absorb body evaluate type biologic change cause Interview subject health family history , occupational exposure , lifestyle factor ( e.g. , tobacco smoking diet ) , inherited difference gene Gene analysis determine genetic variation associate increase decrease risk health effect smoky coal exposure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Females Xuan Wei County almost non-smokers , yet high lung cancer rate China . Non-smoking woman Xuan Wei use smoky coal home inhale ten time high level PAHs 20 cigarette per day active smoker , air concentration approach level experience worker top-side coke oven . Several line research provide strong support excess lung cancer region cause primarily PAHs derive smoky coal exposure . As , region China provide one best opportunity world carry model study gene-environment interaction lung cancer . We design hospital-based case-control study 500 lung cancer case 500 control among non-smoking woman , control select randomized recruitment design achieve balance main effect smoky coal exposure ultimately great power detect interaction . The study carry three-year period Xuan Wei Fu Yuan Counties Yun Nan Province , China . In addition , carry exposure assessment study ( n=150 household ) evaluate air dermal exposure PAHs smoky coal use order model PAH exposure experience subject case-control study . We collect buccal cell , sputum , blood , urine sample subject . The primary goal study characterize genetic risk factor DNA level lung cancer population determine interact smoky coal PAH exposure . In addition , hospital-based design enable u collect venous blood sample cryopreserve lymphocyte , allow u carry state-of-the-art functional susceptibility assay test ability repair PAH-damaged DNA apoptotic capacity , measure integrative marker genomic stability telomere length oxidative damage mitochondrial DNA . These type assay never conduct population hold great promise provide insight cancer risk compliment obtain genotyping . This study provide important complement contrast DCEG extramural study tobacco smoke lung cancer , unravel genetic component challenge part hundred tobacco carcinogens various combination likely contribute .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cases : Lifelong female resident Xuan Wei Fu Yuan Counties age 18 79 year consider base population . Newly diagnose primary female lung cancer case ( ICD9 162 ) , diagnosis base minimum clinical symptom , chest Xray , CT scan , identify two hospital Xuan Wei County , one hospital Fu Yuan County , two hospital Qujing District . Controls : Females alive study period lung cancer resident Xuan Wei Fu Yuan Counties age 18 79 eligible recruitment study . Diagnosed condition know unrelated smoky coal exposure air pollution eligible inclusion study . Potential control diagnose current admission cancer follow noncancer condition ( respiratory tuberculosis ( ICD10 : A15 , 16 , 19 , B90 ) , respiratory infection ( A31 ) , neoplasm ( C00D48 ) , ischaemic heart disease ( I20I25 ) , arterial disease ( I70I73 ) , respiratory disease ( J00J99 ) , peptic ulcer ( K25K27 ) , respiratory symptom ( R04 , R06 , R09 ) , exclude .</criteria>
