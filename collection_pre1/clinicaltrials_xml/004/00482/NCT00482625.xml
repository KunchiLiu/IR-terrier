	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis activate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal transduction biomarker Mucin 5AC ( MUC5AC ) protein expression within intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) lesion great zero absolute mean decrease baseline compare pre post 21-42 day Erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) administration 100mg orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis correlative IPMN EGF inducible biomarkers great zero absolute mean decrease baseline pre post Erlotinib 100mg PO QD therapy . II . Safety Erlotinib treatment . III . To determine Erlotinib pharmacokinetic concentration plasma pancreatic tissue 100mg/day dose 42 day therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD 21-42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo pancreatectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-20 week .</detailed_description>
