	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis chronic multifocal immunoinflammatory , fibroproliferative disease medium-sized large artery drive lipid . Atherosclerosis rarely fatal unless thrombosis supervene , cause acute coronary syndrome . Therefore , event-free survival , vital question atherosclerosis develop rather atherosclerosis , year indolent growth , suddenly become complicated luminal thrombosis . The great majority coronary plaque remain quiescent , least clinical point view . Acute coronary syndrome primarily precipitate ruptured plaque . The precipitate factor condition may find outside rather inside plaque . The challenge find plaque ( ) destine next thrombus-mediated heart attack ( ) , treat , thus avoid heart attack ( ) . Identification vulnerable plaque become key issue . The natural history individual plaque ( risk thrombosis ) unknown need establish . Multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) provide angiography image vessel wall ( detection , quantification characterization plaque ) .

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis without thrombosis rarely fatal . It acute thrombotic complication account disability death . Therefore , event-free survival , question atherosclerosis develop rather atherosclerosis , year indolent growth , suddenly become complicated luminal thrombosis . Post-mortem clinical observation indicate patient acute coronary syndrome often many rupture and/or active plaque coronary artery . The challenge find plaque ( ) destine next thrombus-mediated heart attack ( ) , treat , thus avoid heart attack ( ) . Identification vulnerable plaque become key issue . The natural history individual plaque ( risk thrombosis ) unknown need establish . Multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) provide angiography image vessel wall . Hypothesis : It CT-scanning possible 1a ) identify differentiate morphology coronary atherosclerotic plaque . 1b ) identify vulnerable plaque . Materials method : 1 . Development MDCT scan protocol accurate assessment coronary artery plaque composition ex vivo examination human coronary artery Institute Forensic Medicine , University Aarhus . Scan protocols parameter intravascular contrast material vary optimize accurate assessment coronary plaque composition . MDCT compare histopathology . 2 . A cross-sectional study clinical application efficiency parameter define sub-study 1 . Forty consecutive patient non ST-elevation myocardial infarction/unstable angina , 80 consecutive patient stable angina recruit investigated MDCT follow CAG IVUS/virtual histology . 3 . A prospective , longitudinal study . After period 12 month patient sub-study 2 re-investigated . 4 . Before cross-sectional study small pilot-study perform . Ten patient non ST-elevation myocardial infarction/unstable angina undergo MDCT CAG IVUS/virtual histology . These patient one month undergo another MDCT . This do make sure possible perform plan longitudinal study . Research plan : 1 . Development MDCT scan protocol accurate assessment coronary artery plaque composition . 2 . Clinical application MDCT scan protocol vivo differentiation coronary artery plaque morphology . Morphologic finding categorize compare IVUS/virtual histology confirmation . 3 . Re-evaluation plaque density morphology one year inclusion second vivo contrast-enhanced MDCT-scanning define morphological plaque category risk progression .</detailed_description>
