	<detailed_description>Current control hemoglobin A1c , blood pressure lipid among patient type 2 diabetes primary care setting adequate prevent complication . Results NIDDK fund R34 pilot study conduct member research team suggest Practice Facilitation feasible may improve risk factor . Practice facilitation occurs train facilitator meet team staff clinician practice period several month . Facilitation meeting create time learn reflection member team improve communication adopt implement strategy improve patient care . The purpose study use Practice Facilitation intervention improve three risk factor among patient type 2 diabetes small , autonomous primary care practice . This intervention base complex adaptive system theory support selection , tailor implementation one strategies improve 3 risk factor intervention practice . Five strategy discuss facilitation stimulate change practice : diabetes registry , point-of-care test HbA1c lipid , group clinic visit , improve decision support visit , patient activation prior visit . The specific objective : 1 ) To evaluate effectiveness sustainability practice facilitation improve risk factor type 2 diabetes complication across variety primary care setting ; 2 ) Assess implementation chronic care model ( CCM ) response intervention ; 3 ) Examine relationship communication within practice team implementation CCM model ; 4 ) From perspective organization conduct intervention primary care practice , examine cost implementing intervention relative risk factor change . The study cluster randomize trial conduct 40 primary care practice randomize intervention control . Data collect practice 40 patient practice use multi-method assessment process baseline , 12 24 month . The intervention series 15 visit 20 intervention practice train facilitator 12 month . Primary hypothesis test 12 month outcome data . Sustainability intervention test 24 month data . Insights include delay intervention conduct control practice evaluate pre-post design .</detailed_description>
