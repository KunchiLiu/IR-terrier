	<detailed_description>Introduction High Resolution Manometry ( HRM ) advance oesophageal measurement permit acquisition pressure data entire length oesophagus time via closely spaced sensor continuously record motor activity oesophagus . This information analyse either conventional line plot spatiotemporal plot , compact , visually intuitive presentation oesophageal pressure activity.1 This process quantify verified 75 normal volunteers.2 Increasing evidence suggest HRM sensitive accurate mean assess oesophageal function compare conventional manometry.1 3 Compared conventional manometry , HRM increase accuracy success bolus transport predicted.1 This important oesophageal symptom closely link impaired bolus transport conventional pressure measurement per se.4 The additional information provide HRM presentation data spatiotemporal plot enable investigator study pressure activity oesophagus normal eat behaviour first time . This study ass effect position , bolus volume consistency ( liquid , solid ) . In addition , pressure activity standardize test meal observe . Understanding oesophageal response due 'physiologic challenge ' likely clinical importance patient complain swallow problem , regurgitation chest pain event postprandial period . This contrast standard manometry protocol include intake individual water , viscous fluid ( e.g . yoghurt ) small , solid bolus swallow . Healthy control study provide normal data . Patients refer investigation oesophageal symptom study ass whether physiologic challenge increase ability differentiate group normal control , explain patient symptom increase diagnostic yield . Effects Position It well know transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation ( TLOSRs ) reflux event suppress supine position healthy volunteer patient mild-moderate reflux disease.7 The effect position oesophageal peristalsis low oesophageal sphincter pressure assess conventional manometry less consistent . Recently HRM video-fluoroscopy apply study effect position bolus consistency oesophageal function.8 No effect position LOS pressure find thin , healthy volunteer . In contrast peristaltic pressure increase velocity decrease subject move upright supine position . Similarly , peristaltic pressure increase velocity decrease progressively subject take dry , water solid swallows.8 These observation confirm combine manometry impedance study show oesophageal function stereotype responds workload require bolus transport . 5 67 Although finding consistent give individual , variation peristaltic contractile pressure high correlation peristaltic pressure success bolus transport healthy volunteer patient weak . Rather , preliminary observation Fox et al . suggest successful bolus transport , especially solid , may depend effective coordination proximal ( striate ) mid-distal ( smooth muscle ) contraction increase peristaltic pressure . In particular prompt response mid-oesophageal segment appear link successful bolus transport oesophagus.8 Swallowed material transport successfully oesophagus upside position . With use HRM , detailed analysis oesophageal peristalsis bolus transport pharynx stomach possible . We propose explore effect 3 different position ( upright , supine 60o head ) swallow liquid viscous material healthy volunteer . Use extreme head position provide classical physiologic challenge highlight oesophageal response increase work gravity . Further event increase oesophageal workload include rapid intake large volume fluid ( i.e . free drinking ) intake solid food ( i.e . test meal ) . Following study position oesophageal function , assess effect drink standardize fluid load multiple repeat swallow intake standardized test meal oesophageal low oesophageal sphincter function . Observations continue 20minutes ingestion ass also oesophago-gastric function postprandial period . Study hypothesis The drive force develop oesophageal motor function 'increases ' progressively workload ( e.g . increase inclination , solid food ) healthy volunteer . Hypothesis # 1 : This 'increase drive force ' apparent consistent increase coordination peristaltic contraction development intra-bolus pressure ( i.e . endpoint assess HRM ) effect contractile pressure ( i.e . ; endpoint assess also conventional manometry ) . Repeated swallow drinking suppresses oesophageal contractility . Hypothesis # 2 : Intermittent , coordinate powerful peristaltic wave observe test meal failure activity result raise intra-bolus pressure symptom ( dysphagia , regurgitation , chest pain ) . Hypothesis # 3 : Observations test meal increase diagnostic yield rumination reflux relate symptom stationary study .</detailed_description>
