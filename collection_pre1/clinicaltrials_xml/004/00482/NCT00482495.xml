	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth multiple myeloma block blood flow cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine hematologic response rate patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat bevacizumab . - Determine proportion patient progression free fail treatment 1 year . Secondary - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine time disease progression patient receive drug . - Determine overall survival survival 1 year patient receive drug . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample obtain correlative study baseline , course 2 , 12 week . Samples analyze interleukin-6 , Flt-1 , VEGF level . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
