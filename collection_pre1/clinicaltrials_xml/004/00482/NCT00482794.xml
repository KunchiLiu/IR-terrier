	<brief_summary>Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ( APS ) characterize presence antiphospholipid antibody , protein blood interfere body 's ability perform normal blood clotting . Clinical problem associate antiphospholipid antibody include increase risk formation blood clot lung deep vein leg , stroke , heart attack , recurrent miscarriage . It possible people APS genetic predisposition develop syndrome . This study use genetic strategy identify potential inherit risk factor development APS recruit people APS family member also affect syndrome another autoimmune disorder , lupus rheumatoid arthritis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Risk Factors Associated With Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>APS autoimmune disorder cause increase risk develop venous arterial thromboembolism , well recurrent miscarriage . APS frequently occur people lupus , refer secondary APS case . Many people APS , however , another autoimmune disorder , disease refer primary APS . APS may genetic disorder , identify gene ( ) predispose individual develop could lead good understanding disease , well improve therapy . This study use genetic strategy identify potential risk factor development APS recruit people APS family member either affect syndrome another autoimmune disorder . The result genetic testing compare among follow two group family : people APS also one family member affect specifically APS ; people APS also one family member affect another type autoimmune disorder , lupus rheumatoid arthritis . Participants study perform pre-screening questionnaire phone determine relevant clinical diagnosis collect brief family history autoimmune disorder . Eligible participant receive enrollment package mail . If possible , participant report study site supply detail family medical history provide blood sample analysis antiphospholipid antibody preparation genomic DNA . If participant unable attend study visit , interview conduct phone . Those unable attend site visit receive blood enrollment kit mail , participant report convenient location phlebotomy service . Participants already provide blood sample APS Collaborative Registry ( APSCORE ) may provide another sample study . Information collect statistical analysis include follow data : demographic information ; co-morbid condition chronic risk factor ; lipid profile ; history recurrent infection , renal failure , cardiovascular disease ; height weight ; detail medication supplement currently take ; venous arterial thromboembolic event ; history adverse pregnancy outcome .</detailed_description>

Presence lupus anticoagulant plasma two occasion least 6 week apart Presence clinical symptom see patient APS , include vascular thrombosis ( one clinical episodes arterial , venous , small vessel thrombosis tissue organ ) and/or pregnancy morbidity , define follow : 1 . One unexplained death morphologically normal fetus beyond 10th week gestation , normal fetus morphology document ultrasound direct examination fetus 2 . One premature birth morphologically normal baby 34th week gestation severe preeclampsia , eclampsia , severe placental insufficiency 3 . Three unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortion 10th week gestation , maternal anatomic hormonal abnormality paternal maternal chromosomal cause exclude People elevate antiphospholipid antibody level fully meet clinical criterion APS , affect family member , consider enrollment No document presence antiphospholipid antibody</criteria>
