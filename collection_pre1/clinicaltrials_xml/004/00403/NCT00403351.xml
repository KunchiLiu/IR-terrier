	<brief_summary>Estimating risk future cardiovascular event death , stroke myocardial infarction use traditional risk factor ( age , gender , smoking , diabetes , hyperlipidaemia hypertension ) well accepted patient without exist cardiovascular disease . These estimate base number robust observational study , include original Framingham study . While method apply reasonably well population level application individual patient always straightforward . In addition , risk chart , publish Joint British Societies American Heart Association , may underestimate risk certain group , notably diabetic patient Indo-Asian background , whilst overestimate risk others ( much 50 % study ) .</brief_summary>
