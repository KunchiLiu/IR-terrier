	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab Treatment Central Retinal Vein Occlusion With Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , Phase I study intravitreally administer ranibizumab 20 subject macular edema associate CRVO . Patients evaluate baseline ophthalmic examination , fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography , color photography . Subjects receive open-label intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab administer every 28 Â± 2 day total 3 injection . Thereafter evaluate every month month 12 . If patient sign increase intraretinal hemorrhage persistence / increase central macular edema determine optical coherence tomography compare last visit , eligible re-injection monthly visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study Age &gt; 18 year Clinical evidence perfuse central retinal vein occlusion . A central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) define eye retinal hemorrhage dilate retinal venous system 4 quadrant . Other evidence CRVO may include telangiectatic capillary bed collateral vessel optic nerve head . . Central macular edema present clinical examination OCT test central point thickness &gt; 250 micron Visual acuity score great equal 34 letter ( 20/200 ) less equal 73 letter ( 20/40 ) ETDRS visual acuity protocol . Media clarity , pupillary dilation patient cooperation sufficient allow OCT test retinal photography Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) know pregnant , also premenopausal woman use adequate contraception . Participation another simultaneous ocular investigation trial Patient uncontrolled hypertension Patient condition , opinion investigator would preclude participation study ( i.e . chronic alcoholism , drug abuse ) Patient significant diabetic retinopathy ( great moderate NPDR ) macular edema associate diabetic retinopathy Exam OCT reveal evidence vitreoretinal interface abnormality may contribute macular edema Eye investigator chance improvement visual acuity follow resolution macular edema ( i.e subretinal fibrosis geographic atrophy ) Any additional ocular disease could irreversibly compromise visual acuity study eye include amblyopia , anterior ischemic optic neuropathy ( AION ) , age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) , retinal detachment , severe cataract , etc . Evidence neovascularization iris retina ( presence ischemic CRVO ) History Grid/Focal laser Panretinal laser study eye History vitreous surgery study eye History use intravitreal , peribulbar , retrobulbar steroid within six month study . History Cataract Surgery within 6 month enrollment . History YAG capsulotomy within 2 month surgery . Visual acuity &lt; 20/400 fellow eye Uncontrolled Glaucoma , pressure &gt; 30 despite treatment glaucoma medication . Use Bevacizumab either eye within past 30 day Use Pegaptinib sodium either eye within past 6 week Use Triamcinolone either eye Have receive systemic experimental drug within 12 week prior enrollment .
