	<brief_title>Preliminary Study Identification Calcium-Binding Proteins Serum Various Metabolic Bone Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis important costly health issue . The diagnosis disease base measurement bone mineral density occurrence characteristic fracture . Currently possible predict fracture individual patient , ability monitor response treatment limit well . We synthesize characterize novel photoreactive Ca2+-analog reagent , Azido ruthenium ( AzRu ) bind covalently Ca2+-binding site protein . The specificity AzRu Ca2+-binding protein , photoactivation radioactive labeling pave way wide use AzRu powerful tool ass Ca2+-dependent cellular process , vitro vivo . Using radiolabeled AzRu , possible identify Ca2+-binding protein biological sample whole cell , isolated mitochondrion , ER protein contain fraction . Protein bind [ 103Ru ] AzRu biological sample separate SDS gel electrophoresis , follow Coomassie stain exposure dry gel X-ray film ( autoradiography ) . This allow identification [ 103Ru ] radiolabeled protein . The labeled protein band cut gel subject MALADI-TOF analysis identity protein determine sequence homology search . These would allow detection Ca2+-binding proteins serum various disease disorder , potentially leading identification novel biomarkers disease diagnostics . We would like use blood sample carry procedure describe identification Ca2+ binding protein appear level increase disease pathogenic condition . Since Ca2+ binding protein play important role bone metabolism , chose test occurrence serum patient osteoporosis metabolic bone disease .</detailed_description>
