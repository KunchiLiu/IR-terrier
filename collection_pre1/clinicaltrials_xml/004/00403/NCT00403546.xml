	<brief_title>High-Dose Oral Ziprasidone Versus Conventional Dosing Schizophrenia Patients With Residual Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ziprasidone atypical antipsychotic medication demonstrate efficacy comparable superior conventional antipsychotic dose range 80 160 mg/d relatively free weight-gain , extrapyramidal side effect , prolactin elevation . Early dose find trial predict dose 20-40 mg/d would produce optimal striatal D2 occupancy repeat dose . This estimate later find incorrect , clinical efficacy observe dos 80mg/d . Doses great 160mg/d systematically study randomize dose finding trial . The range ziprasidone dose study early dose find trial constrain concern cardiac conduction effect higher dos . It subsequently show QTc prolongation minimally increase elevation ziprasidone blood level typically achieve dose 160mg/day . In addition , ziprasidone 320mg/day produce significant QTc delay compare ziprasidone 160mg/day randomize , prospective safety study . Deutchman Deutchman describe clinical experience high-dose ziprasidone state half patient experienced significant improvement psychosis affective symptom follow dose escalation . The investigator report high-dose ziprasidone generally well-tolerated , 75 % report side-effects few 10 % reporting sedation , common complaint . One patient drop due restlessness . Given patient may require ziprasidone dose 160mg/day achieve optimal D2 occupancy , good tolerability , absence significant cardiac conduction effect higher dos , positive finding preliminary trial high-dose ziprasidone , propose conduct randomize , 8-week , placebo-controlled trial dose escalation patient remain symptomatic least 3 week treatment ziprasidone 160mg/day . The study include adult inpatient outpatient Schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder remain symptomatic despite treatment ziprasidone 160mg/d least 3 week . The study encourage prospective , open-label trial ziprasidone last least 3 week subject order verify treatment resistance ; write informed consent require subject start open treatment period . Study-wide expect enroll 80 total subject . At MGH site expect enroll 8 subject . The propose trial placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind . Subjects treatment resistant meet entry criterion randomly allocate receive ziprasidone placebo added-on open-label dose ziprasidone 8 week . Subjects stratify within arm accord duration prior ziprasidone treatment ( le 6 week 6 week longer ; purpose stratification describe `` brief '' `` chronic '' treatment respectively ) . All subject randomly assign ziprasidone 40 mg capsule match placebo 1:1 ratio , stratify accord duration prior ziprasidone treatment . Subjects instruct take one study capsule twice daily ( total 80 mg/d ) add regular open-label ziprasidone dose ( total 240 mg/d ) . After first week , study drug increase two tablet twice daily ( 160 mg/d ) total 320 mg/d . Subjects assign placebo remain open-label ziprasidone 160 mg/d study . Overall 7 study visit . On visit , subject evaluate standard psychiatric rating scale psychopathology , cognition , side effect . In addition , measure serum level medication use , fast blood lab , drug screen , pregnancy test , vital sign , EKGs multiple point study . SCoRS Informants complete SCoRS rating scale two time point : Baseline Week 8 . The two primary endpoint mean improvement PANSS total score baseline response rate define reduction PANSS total score baseline 20 % great . Secondary endpoint include mean improvement PANSS Positive Negative Syndrome subscales , mean improvement Calgary Depression Rating Scale total score change GAF , CGI , SCoRS score . Tolerability measure completion rate , change vital sign , treatment-emergent side effect , SAS , BAS , AIMS total score , frequency abnormal laboratory measure , increase QTc 500 msec great .</detailed_description>
