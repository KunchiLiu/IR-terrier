	<brief_summary>To measure colour vision patient blue light filter lens implant one eye non-tinted implant eye ( compare group control group bilateral non-tinted implant ) determine whether blue light filter lens limit colour vision</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Do Blue-Blocking Lenses Block Blue Colour From Our Lives ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As age , natural lens inside eye becomes denser , hazy yellow colour . In word , cataract develop . In order enable clear vision , cataract surgery perform . This involve remove natural lens eye replace synthetic lens implant inside eye . Cataract surgery insertion lens implant first do 1948 n't become routine early 1980s . Around time , awareness harmful effect UV light raise 1986 , lens implant routinely UV filter incorporate them.1 As early 1992 , study examine patient high occupational exposure blue visible light , conclude positive association long term exposure visible light age relate wear tear change back eye , term age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) .2 This theory support several study report increased rate progression AMD patient cataract surgery clear lens implant ( It know clear lens implant transmit blue light back eye compare natural age lens ) .3 Laboratory study 2000 show blue light cause damage age retinal cell ( nerve cell back eye important enable u see ) , green light white light.4 Experimental study rat also show exposure blue light 30 time damaging retinal cell compare yellow light.5 A laboratory study 2004 confirm protect age retinal cell blue light filter lens , damage cause blue light prevented.6 Yellow tint , blue light filter lens implant production since 1991 , first Hoya Tokyo Alcon well . Alcon produce Acrysof Natural lens implant design mimic 53 year old natural lens receive FDA CE approval 2003 . To date , 2 million lens implanted patient world wide.7 Although lens implant sometimes use patient cataract surgery UK , yet routine . One concern whether limit colour vision way . There study examine far , none find statistically significant difference colour vision patient non-tinted lens implant blue-filtering lens implants.8,9,10 However , none study thus far , employ colour vision test anomaloscope ( consider gold standard colour vision test ) .11 In addition , none take account level capsular opacification ( capsule cling film bag-like structure support lens implant inside eye period time , become thickened hazy follow cataract surgery ) level macular pigment ( yellow pigment centre part back eyes think contribute towards filter blue light ) patient ' eye . Age relate macular degeneration already common cause blindness UK . It grow problem , particularly age population increase level ambient light expose daily life . Although evidence strongly favour filter blue light need protective measure AMD pressing , need satisfied adverse effect block blue life .</detailed_description>
