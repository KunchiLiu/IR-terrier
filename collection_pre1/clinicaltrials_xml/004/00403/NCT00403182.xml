	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . It yet know whether give chemotherapy hormone therapy effective give hormone therapy chemotherapy treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study chemotherapy see well work give hormone therapy first-line therapy treat postmenopausal woman metastatic locally advanced breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine optimal sequence chemotherapy endocrine therapy first-line therapy postmenopausal woman metastatic locally advanced breast cancer potentially sensitive modality . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , crossover , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( chemotherapy first ) : Beginning within 4 week randomization , patient receive chemotherapy* comprise either anthracycline- taxane-based regimen , combination drug , accord local institutional guideline . Treatment continue 6 month longer , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After discontinuation chemotherapy , patient receive endocrine therapy comprise oral letrozole daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients immediately life-threatening disease ( e.g. , lymphangitis carcinomatosa liver involvement exceed 1/3 liver ) recommend second-line chemotherapy . NOTE : *Patients may receive chemotherapy separate clinical chemotherapy trial must first undergo randomization study . - Arm II ( endocrine therapy first ) : Beginning immediately randomization , patient receive oral letrozole daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients demonstrate progressive disease receive chemotherapy arm I . Quality life pain assess baseline periodically 5 year . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,500 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
