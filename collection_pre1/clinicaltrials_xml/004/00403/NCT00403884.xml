	<brief_title>Selective RPE Laser Treatment ( SRT ) Various Macular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional laser photocoagulation show beneficial variety retinal disease like age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) , diabetic maculopathy ( DMP ) , diabetic retinopathy ( DRP ) central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) . There several hint positive effect mediate RPE . The RPE main target laser energy due high amount melanosomes absorb 50 60 % energy apply retina . Today conventional retinal laser treatment perform use continuous-wave argon laser ( 514 nm ) . Generally exposure time longer 50 m , typically 100 200ms . After application laser energy onto retina usually ophthalmoscopically visible grayish-white lesion result thermal heat conduction . Histologically destruction RPE , primary absorption site , occur , lead irreversible destruction outer inner segment neuroretina due thermal denaturation . The effect laser treatment fundus study several group . In vivo could observe argon laser photocoagulation monkey- human fundus cause necrosis RPE detachment RPE Bruch´s membrane , bud individual RPE cell multilayered RPE formation area laser irradiation seven day treatment . Histologic section reveal irradiate RPE conventional argon laser whole area cell destroy choriocapillaris well vessel choroid damage . After laser photocoagulation RPE cell migrate proliferate cover defect . In vivo mild coagulation usually perform macular coagulation RPE barrier get intact . Several macular disease think cause reduced function RPE cell . Therefore method selective destruction RPE cell without cause adverse effect choroid neuroretina , especially photoreceptors , seem appropriate treatment ( SRT ) . The selective effect RPE cell , absorb 50 % incident light due high melanosome content demonstrate use 5 µs argon laser pulse 514nm repetition rate 500 Hz . By irradiate fundus train µs laser pulse possible achieve high peak temperature around melanosomes . This lead destruction RPE , low sublethal temperature increase adjacent tissue structure . This selective destruction RPE cell spar photoreceptors without cause laser scotoma proven histologic examination different time treatment . The first clinical trial use Nd : YLF laser system pulse duration 1,7µs ( 100 pulse , 100 500 Hz ) also prove concept selective RPE destruction demonstrate clinical potential technique . However , one problem concern selective RPE laser destruction inability visualize laser lesion . Therefore necessary perform fluorescein angiography treatment confirm laser success make sure sufficient energy use . Since dosimetry laser lesion know , test lesion various energy number pulse non-significant area macula - usually low vessel arcade - applied elucidate energy level require treatment . If RPE damage , tight junction RPE barrier broken , fluorescein angiography pool choriocapillaris subretinal space . Thus fluorescein angiography use detect break RPE barrier . However , fluorescein angiography invasive method already describe potential risk allergic reaction intravenous injection fluorescein dye . The damage mechanism SRT thermo-mechanical one purely thermal one conventional laser treatment due short-duration laser pulse microsecond-regime . Thus , microbubble formation around melanosomes inside RPE cell occur treatment , probably lead disruption cell ; contrast thermal denaturation conventional laser photocoagulation . The formation microbubbles around strong absorb melanosomes inside RPE proof damage mechanism irradiation RPE µs laser pulse . If energy absorb convert heat thermoelastic expansion absorb medium generate opto-acoustic ( OA ) transient . During irradiation RPE µs laser pulse classical thermoelastic transient emit . Due formation collapse microbubbles around melanosomes successful SRT treatment , additional OA bubble transient emit . This analogous emission acoustic transient formation collapse cavitation bubble . An OA base on-line dosimetry system differentiate pure thermoelastic transient subthreshold irradiation OA bubble transient superimpose pure thermoelastic transient case successful treatment irradiation . Thus , SRT clinically guide specific OA detection system . In prospective clinical study SRT perform various pulse duration 1.7µs additionally 200ns evaluate different clinical effect laser regimen , already determine safe animal experiment . The macular disease treat drusen maculopathy geographic atrophy due age-related macular degeneration well diabetic macular edema central serous chorioretinopathy . The beneficial effect laser treatment diabetic macular edema think associate restoration new barrier retinal pigment epithelium cell . A similar effect postulate treatment drusen , central serous retinopathy macular edema vein occlusion . If latter theory true , destruction photoreceptors cause visual field defect would unwanted unnecessary side effect . Thus , SRT able avoid unintentional side effect achieve benefit treating RPE . In study clinical effect SRT diseases evaluate long-term basis . For diabetic macular edema previously non-treated eye focal diffuse macular edema randomize SRT conventional treatment . Best correct visual acuity least 0.1 central ischemia must present . The endpoint visual acuity reduction edema determine fundus photography , angiography optical coherence tomography . Regarding central serous chorioretinopathy visual acuity decay last longer 2 month angiographically see leakage outside fovea . Endpoint visual acuity reduction subretinal edema determine optical coherence tomography . Regarding AMD drusen maculopathy show soft confluent drusen hyperpigmented spot . Angiographically choroidal neovascularization rule . Both eyes patient must symmetric pattern since one eye treat one observed . End point would visual acuity reduction drusen determine fundus photography . For geographic atrophy due age-related macular degeneration eye patient present symmetric area atrophy . Laser treatment take place rim atrophy zone one eye whereas eye observe . Due RPE proliferation induce SRT major endpoint entity stop reduction geographic atrophy enlargement treat eye compare fellow eye . Visual acuity least 0.1 . All patient follow various time treatment derive strict inclusion follow-up protocol . The study approve institutional study board ethical committee ; patient safety cover private insurance company .</detailed_description>
