	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Steroid therapy , dexamethasone , may reduce swell , pain , symptom inflammation may effective treat problem cause cancer cancer treatment . Supportive care improve quality life patient serious life-threatening disease , prevent treat symptom cancer , side effect treatment , problem related cancer treatment . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether dexamethasone give together supportive care effective without whole-brain radiation therapy treat patient brain metastasis . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study dexamethasone supportive care see well work without whole-brain radiation therapy improve quality life patient non-small cell lung cancer spread brain remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Supportive Care With Without Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Spread Brain Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy dexamethasone v without whole-brain radiotherapy combination optimal supportive care , term patient assess quality adjust life year , patient inoperable brain metastasis secondary non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Assess Karnofsky performance status patient treat regimen . - Assess symptom patient treat regimen . - Determine feasibility assess measure caregiver concern . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( experimental ) : Patients receive dexamethasone* . Patients receive optimal supportive care ( OSC ) include prescription proton pump inhibitor dexamethasone , parallel nursing support , access additional specialist ( e.g. , pain-relief service , palliative care team , medical social worker , physiotherapist ) , open access follow-up specialist clinic . OSC may also include analgesic , bronchodilator , supportive treatment need . - Arm II ( control ) : Patients receive dexamethasone* OSC arm I . Patients also undergo whole-brain radiotherapy daily 5 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients receive prednisolone randomization need convert dexamethasone immediately . All patient undergo telephone assessment , include quality life assessment , week 12 week every 4 week thereafter . Consenting caregiver complete questionnaire telephone week assess impact patient 's disease treatment caregiver 's quality life . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : At least 1,000 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
