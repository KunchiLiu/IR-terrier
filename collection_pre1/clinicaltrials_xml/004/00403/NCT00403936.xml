	<brief_summary>This study design determine whether simple manipulative technique relax tissue occipito-atlantal junction neck effect activity sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system . Subjects dark adapted measure pupillary activity , reflect autonomic nervous system activity take treatment . The study hypothesis thet treatment technique would effect pupillary measure , hence indicate effect autonomic system activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study within subjects/crossover design subject receive treatment serve his/her control . 100 subject recruit student/staff population university , 18 y/o old condition affect pupillary activity . Pupillary activity measure PLR100 pupillometer include pupillary diameter , pupillary response latency , maximum constriction velocity maximum redilation velocity . Subjects adapt dim light environment , measure take , treatment give either third fourth time period measure retake . The study approve NSU IRB . Subject number sufficient statistical power find effect . The study find effect treatment maximum size , show decrease treatment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>18 y/o Normal accommodation pupillary response Willing undergo osteopathic manipulation Active ocular systemic disease Neurologic disease would alter pupillary response Chronic pain syndrome head neck Pregnant Brain injury Taking medication would alter autonomic tone</criteria>
