	<brief_summary>The purpose study conduct Phase I clinical trial involve situ RTVP-1 gene therapy prostate cancer . We conduct necessary safety evaluation new adenovirus contain human gene RTVP-1 . This virus evaluate safety men prostate cancer prior radical prostatectomy . Based preclinical data , hope treatment induce local cytotoxic antiangiogenic effect also , systemic antitumor immune response capable eradicate micrometastatic disease ( reason recurrence many patient ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I - Pre-Radical Prostatectomy RTVP-1 Gene Therapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population select study include patient locally advance and/or poorly differentiate tumor . These patient unacceptably high failure rate treat radical prostatectomy alone ( 50 % fail within 5 year ) . The pattern failure varies . While patient present local recurrence , many local recurrence distant metastasis , distant metastasis . It reasonable assume many , patient , actually harbor micrometastases , present undiagnosed clinically , time radical prostatectomy . Our hypothesis cytotoxic , proapoptotic , antiangiogenic immune stimulatory activity in-situ RTVP-1 gene therapy low incidence local tumor recurrence give patient prior surgery . The second part hypothesis RTVP-1 gene therapy induce systemic anti-tumor immune response , eliminate pre-existing micrometastases patient low overall failure rate . While Phase I study design answer question , hope obtain mechanistic evidence support hypothesis . A Phase II study propose ( properly power ) , study efficacy approach . Based experience HSV-tk GCV in-situ gene therapy , appear maximal immune stimulation occur 2 week follow vector injection . Furthermore , repeat injection adenoviral vector result excess toxicity generation anti-adenoviral antibody sufficient suppress vector activity . We propose intraprostatic injection RTVP-1 adenoviral vector 4-6 week prior radical prostatectomy , order allow full expression gene therapy tissue effect .</detailed_description>
