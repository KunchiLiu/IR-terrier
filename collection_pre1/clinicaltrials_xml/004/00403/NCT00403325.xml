	<detailed_description>This open-label , Phase I study intravitreally administer ranibizumab subject unresolving CSC subfoveal fluid . Patients evaluate baseline ophthalmic examination , fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography , color photography . Subjects receive open-label intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab administer every 28 day ( Â± 2 day ) 3 injection . Thereafter evaluate every month month 12 . Treatment administer patient presence active leakage determine fluorescein angiography persistence presence sub retinal fluid upon OCT examination monthly visit .</detailed_description>
