	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Combined With Intravitreal Ranibizumab Treatment Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label dose escalate study ( n=15 ) evaluate safety tolerability addition imatinib mesylate Lucentis treatment regime 6 month period patient newly diagnose choroidal neovascularization : - 5 patient treat 4 week imatinib mesylate 400mg per day ( low typical start dose ) start concurrently ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) 0.5mg intravitreal injection . The patient would inject monthly interval first 3 month follow treatment need basis . - If imatinib mesylate safely tolerate first 4 week , follow set 5 patient treat 6 week imatinib mesylate 400mg per day start concurrently Lucentis 0.5mg intravitreal injection . The patient would inject monthly interval first 3 month follow treatment need basis . - If imatinib mesylate safely tolerate first 6 week , follow set 5 patient treat 8 week imatinib mesylate 400mg per day start concurrently Lucentis 0.5mg intravitreal injection . The patient would inject monthly interval first 3 month follow treatment need basis .</detailed_description>
