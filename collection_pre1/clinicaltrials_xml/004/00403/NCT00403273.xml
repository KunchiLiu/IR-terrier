	<brief_summary>Primary Total Knee joint replacement surgery highly successful surgery relieve pain improve function patient disable arthritis . Unfortunately , like biomedical device , prosthesis failure complication knee replacement surgery lead disable pain , stiffness loss function . Approximately 1 % knee replacement fail every year lead 20 % failure rate 20 year . The common cause failure prosthetic joint infection , loosening , trauma wear prosthesis . Currently , revision surgery best option long term pain relief ( analgesic pain medication option limited benefit ) . Surgery may feasible patient due advance age , medical condition surgical/technical difficulty patient 's choice . In addition , result revision surgery good initial knee joint surgery . Therefore , great need novel , targeted therapy provide option patient unfit , unable , unwilling undergo surgery . In investigator ' recent pilot study , single injection Botulinum toxin A ( Botox ) painful natural knee , ankle shoulder joint patient various type arthritis lead significant durable improvement pain function safe use . The investigator propose 6-month study compare pain relief , improvement function safety injection Botulinum toxin compare placebo patient painful prosthetic knee joint . Both patient investigator blind treatment assignment patient study complete . The investigator assess amount duration pain relief , improvement function short term safety Botulinum toxin use standard validated measure . Patients evaluated baseline , 2 week , 1- , 2- , 3- , 4- 6-months single injection either placebo BoNT/A hip knee prosthesis . The six-month follow-up ass duration meaningful pain relief . If successful , offer new treatment option patient chronically painful knee prosthetic joint , provide insight origin cause pain prosthetic joint direct future investigation new direction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Botulinum Toxin A Injection Patients With Painful Artificial Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>`` This 6-month randomized , placebo-controlled , double blind trial compare single intra-articular ( IA ) injection 100 unit Botulinum Toxin A ( BoNT/A ) placebo improvement pain , function quality life ( QOL ) , safety patient painful total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Patients recruit Minneapolis VA Medical Center . Patients eligible age 18 , TKA , pain ≥6/10 0-10 numeric rating scale ( NRS ) candidate revision surgery . The primary outcome : ( 1 ) proportion clinically meaningful change pain severity ( 0-10 scale ) 2 month IA injection . The choice 2-month primary end-point base previous observation open-label case series painful TKA . Secondary outcome assess efficacy follow-up ( FU ) visit . The duration trial 6-months capture duration pain relief . Based trial Botulinum toxin , expect peak effect 2-8 week expect effect wear 2-4 month . Therefore , analyse except duration pain relief , efficacy time-points ( 2 wk , 4 wk , 2 month ) possibly 3- 4-month ( depend duration pain relief ) use . Secondary outcome include : ( 1 ) clinically meaningful pain relief ( ≥2-point ≥30 % decrease ) pain severity ( 0-10 scale ) ; ( 2 ) change pain severity 2 month efficacy time-points ; ( 3 ) percent Minimal Clinically Important Improvement Western Ontario MacMaster Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) pain function sub-scales 2 month efficacy time-points ; ( 4 ) amount duration pain relief ; ( 5 ) patient physician global assessment response 2 month efficacy time-points ; ( 6 ) QOL assess WOMAC Short-form 36 ( SF-36 ) score 2 month efficacy time-points ; ( 7 ) change function Timed Stands Test ( TST ) Timed-up-and-go ( TUG ) test 2 month efficacy time-points ; ( 8 ) change dose analgesic study . We determine time onset duration pain relief time improvement function . Safety assess structure interview form adverse effect , sensory manual muscle strength test , index joint examination swelling , erythema tenderness . At visit # 1 , inform consent screen inclusion/exclusion criterion , patient undergo : index joint X-ray , laboratory test ; history , physical examination , index joint pain history , comorbidity medication history ; patient pain assessment , WOMAC SF-36 ; blind index joint , neurological examination , TST TUG test . 50 patient randomize receive either IA BoNT/A 100 unit sterile saline index joint . FU phone interview 2 4-weeks include pain assessment , WOMAC , patient ' global assessment adverse effect . Interim visit 2 , 3 4-months identical visit # 1 , also include patient ' physician ' global assessment joint injection . End study visit 6 month identical interim visit addition index joint X-ray laboratory test . Main analysis include patient unilateral TKAs . Sensitivity analyse do include patient bilateral knee , account correlatedness observation . Multiple analysis variance , mixed model regression analyse and/or generalize estimate equation use analysis continuous categorical outcome respectively . Chi-square test use compare frequency adverse event . Analysis intention-to-treat .</detailed_description>
