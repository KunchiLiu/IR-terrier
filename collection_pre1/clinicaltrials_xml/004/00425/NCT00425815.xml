	<brief_summary>The TURNS National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) fund contract evaluation new compound treatment cognitive impairment schizophrenia ( HHSN 27820044 1003C ; P.I . : Steve Marder , M.D. ) . Despite advance safety , tolerability , effectiveness antipsychotic medication treatment schizophrenia , many patient continue plague impairment social work function . Persons schizophrenia commonly show deficit number area cognition include impairment attention , memory , executive functioning ( ability organize one 's behavior ) . Importantly , large body literature show link cognition community function schizophrenia . It believe treatment improve cognitive deficit may lead improvement work social functioning . A promising approach improve community function patient schizophrenia develop new agent treat cognitive deficit illness . One type pharmacological compound show promise improve cognition group drug call ampakines . These drug believe improve activity neurotransmitter system brain call glutamate system . Increased activity system link improvement cognitive functioning . The current study eight-week trial compare two dos ampakine drug , Org 24448 , add patient ' current atypical antipsychotic medication . One hundred thirty-five patient schizophrenia , draw seven site , participate study . Cognition measure use variety paper-and-pencil computerized measure consensus-derived NIMH Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia ( MATRICS ) cognitive battery . Psychiatric symptom ability perform community-based task daily living also measure . Because previous trial drug similar drug detect last cognitive benefit , trial also repeat clinical assessment four week completion study medication .</brief_summary>

Evaluate tolerability Org 24448 250 mg BID 500 mg BID compare placebo measure Side Effect Checklist , AIMS , SAS , study completion rate , frequency abnormal laboratory value . Tertiary Objective : 5 . Evaluate persistence effect clinical rating 4 week completion 8-week trial . Methods : Study Locations : This study coordinate study PI , Dr. Goff , TURNS Treatment Management Unit direction Dr. Buchanan . Patients recruit Massachusetts General Hospital Massachusetts Mental Health Center Boston ( Dr. Goff ) , Lemuel Shattuck Hospital Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( Dr. Seidman ) , Nathan Kline Institute ( Drs . Javitt Nolan ) , Washington University Medical Center ( Drs . Csernansky Barch ) , Maryland Psychiatric Research Center ( Drs . Buchanan Gold ) , Duke School Medicine ( Drs . McEvoy Keefe ) , University California Los Angeles ( Drs . Marder Green ) Columbia University ( Drs . Lieberman Kimhy ) . The TURNS NIMH-funded contract evaluation new compound treatment cognitive impairment schizophrenia ( HHSN 27820044 1003C ; P.I . : Steve Marder , M.D. ) . Data management perform Clinical Trials Data Management Unit Nathan Kline Institute direction Jim Robinson , M.S. , statistical analysis perform Dr. Robert McMahon Maryland Psychiatric Research Center . Org 24448 match placebo capsule provide Organon Pharmaceuticals . Laboratory assay perform Quest Diagnostics . Subjects : Subjects include 135 inpatient outpatient schizophrenia treat least 8 week stable dose atypical antipsychotic clozapine . Prior enrollment , determine clinician optimize dose antipsychotic maintain medication constant dose least 4 week . Diagnoses confirm use SCID . Patients exclude significant medical illness , seizure disorder , substance abuse , inability provide inform consent . Because primary hypothesis Org 24448 improve measure attention memory , patient must capable complete neuropsychological battery , minimum threshold cognitive impairment require inclusion . Screening : The diagnosis schizophrenia confirm research psychiatrist use modify version Structured Clinical Interview DSM IV ( SCID ) . The BPRS , SANS , CDRS SAS administer verify inclusionary criterion meet . A physical examination , include neurological exam , perform medical history , vital sign ( weight , heart rate , oral temperature , sit stand blood pressure ) , demographic information obtain . Laboratory assessment include standard screen blood test : electrolyte , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , fast glucose , liver enzymes , T4 , calcium , phosphate , magnesium , albumin complete blood count ( CBC ) differential platelet count . A pregnancy test do premenopausal woman . A routine urinalysis , drug screen , EKG EEG hyperventilation photic stimulation also perform . The screen visit collect data require complete inclusionary exclusionary criterion except performance MATRICS battery WTAR , administer baseline measurement week 1 stabilization phase minimize practice effect . In addition , subject must continue meet inclusionary exclusionary criterion baseline symptom rating perform completion stabilization phase ( stabilization week 2 ) . Stabilization Phase : After inform consent obtain screening complete , subject enter two-week , single-blind placebo lead-in stabilization phase . Placebo administer two capsule twice daily dispense blister pack identical use randomize , double-blind treatment phase . Baseline assessment complete stabilization phase compliance study medication assess . Plasma obtain assay antipsychotic concentration week 2 stabilization phase . The plasma sample draw trough level . This phase intend reduce placebo-response double-blind treatment phase , allow completion baseline assessment , provide opportunity investigator identify resolve potential problem compliance . The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB ) , Wechsler Test Adult Reading ( WTAR ) , Schizophrenia Cognitive Rating Scale ( SCoRS ) , University California San Diego ( UCSD ) Performance-Based Skills Assessment ( UPSA ) complete stabilization week 1 ; clinical scale ( describe `` Assessments '' ) complete stabilization week 2 . Double-Blind Phase : Patients randomize 1:1:1 ratio placebo , Org 24448 250 mg BID Org 24448 500 mg BID administer identical-appearing capsule eight week . Study drug dispense weekly blister pack contain placebo Org 24448 250 mg capsule complete stabilization phase ( stabilization week 2 baseline assessment ) . Subjects give three extra day medication case miss appointment . All subject take two capsule twice daily . The antipsychotic dose unchanged trial . Patients ask bring previous blister pack visit ; count remain capsule perform record . Patients return follow-up week 12 , four week complete double-blind trial . Investigators may reduce morning ( AM ) dose study drug one capsule ( 250 mg ) necessary due poor tolerance . Subjects may continue reduce dose , one week , investigator may attempt resume full dose ( two capsule BID ) . If reduce dose ( three capsule daily ) tolerate , subject discontinue study . Patients miss 7 consecutive day study drug find take 75 % few study dose two pill count drop study . Assessments : The following scale complete stabilization week 2 ( baseline ) week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 &amp; 12 comprise clinical assessment battery : Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) , Calgary Depression Rating Scale ( CDRS ) Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) . In addition , Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) Simpson Angus Scale Extrapyramidal Symptoms ( SAS ) perform baseline week 4 , 8 &amp; 12 . Assessment function perform baseline , week 4 &amp; 8 ( end study ) use Schizophrenia Cognitive Rating Scale ( SCoRS ) UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment ( UPSA ) . The SCoRS repeat week 12 . Cognitive functioning assess baseline , week 4 week 8 ( end study ) use MATRICS battery plus NAB Daily Living Memory Delayed Recall Trial Hopkins Verbal Learning Test . A one-week window ( 3 day 4 day schedule visit ) allow completion assessment accommodate unusual unavoidable circumstance . All site certify administration MATRICS , SCoRS UPSA assessment prior initiation study . Inter-rater reliability establish BPRS SANS start study reassess every three month circulation videotape interview . Safety Assessments : Vital sign Side Effects Checklist perform adverse event record weekly two-week stabilization phase 8 week trial weekly 4 week follow completion trial . Laboratory assessment , include urinalysis , repeat week 4 , 6 8 ( end study ) . An EKG repeat week 2 , 4 8 . A white blood count ( WBC ) absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) repeat weekly 8 week trial weekly 4 week follow completion trial . A physical examination , include neurological examination , repeat week 8 ( end study ) .Drug Plasma Concentrations : Plasma obtain baseline week 4 8 assay antipsychotic concentration .
