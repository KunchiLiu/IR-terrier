The study consist 3 phase : pretreatment ( screen visit 56-day baseline period ) , double-blind treatment ( 12 week treatment either 200 mg per day RWJ-333369 , 400 mg per day RWJ-333369 , placebo ) , posttreatment ( posttreatment visit occur 7 14 day last dose double-blind study drug ) . The posttreatment phase patient continue open-label extension study . The open-label extension study offer completion double-blind treatment phase study doctor judge patient may benefit continued treatment RWJ-333369 . The open-label extension study last RWJ-333369 becomes available prescription development stop sponsor . The efficacy RWJ-333369 base change frequency severity seizure . Safety assessment include adverse event ( side effect ) reporting , collect blood test Electrocardiograms perform physical exam , include vitals sign . The study hypothesis 400 mg per day RWJ-333369 good placebo add-on treatment partial onset seizure , measure percent reduction baseline monthly partial onset seizure frequency . 200 mg per day RWJ-333369 , 400 mg per day RWJ-333369 , placebo , give twice daily without food approximately 12 hour apart ; study drug swallow whole chewed , divide , crush , dissolve .</detailed_description>
