	<brief_summary>Following pretreatment evaluation , patient receive PS-341 intravenous push weekly 4 consecutive week follow 24-72 hour rest period . This schedule consist one treatment cycle . Upon completion 4 week PS-341 follow 24-72 hour rest period , radical prostatectomy perform . Surgery delay bleed abnormality ( bleeding time great 10 minute ) platelet count equal 100,000 coagulation profile ( PT , PTT ) normal . If time surgery patient find positive lymph node , prostatectomy abandon , prostate biopsied , patient offer treatment modality ( hormone , radiation therapy ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In murine human xenograft tumor model , administration PS-341 weekly associate significant antitumor activity . In primate study use schedule twice weekly six week , high PS-341 dose associate severe irreversible toxicity 0.067 mg/kg/dose 0.80 mg/m2/dose . The PS-341 dose select study , 1.6 mg/m2 , dose regimen 4-week treatment schedule ( PS-341 weekly four week day 1 , 8 , 15 22 ) support preclinical data data collect completed Phase I study conduct advanced solid tumor hematologic malignancy . In Phase I dose escalation study conduct M.D . Anderson Cancer Center sponsor Millennium Pharmaceuticals , patient solid tumor PS-341 administer per week four week follow 14-day rest period ( 35-day cycle ) , observe MTD 1.8 mg/m2.11,12 The LTs observe 2.0 mg/m2 include hypotension , diarrhea , fatigue . Fifty-three patient treat study receive maximum 15 cycle . At dose level 1.60 mg/m2 , 70 % -75 % 20S proteasome inhibition peripheral blood achieve dose . One false response , major radiographic response retroperitoneal lymph node without PSA change note prostate cancer patient second prostate patient radiographic stabilization retroperitoneal lymph node unchanged PSA . One partial response , major radiographic response retroperitoneal lymph node without PSA change note prostate cancer patient second prostate patient radiographic stabilization retroperitoneal lymph node unchanged PSA . One partial response , major radiographic response retroperitoneal lymph node without PSA change note prostate cancer patient second prostate patient radiographic stabilization retroperitoneal lymph node unchanged PSA . Further company-sponsored trial Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center assess twice weekly administration two week every three week . This trial currently dose 1.65 mg/m2 proteasome inhibition range 74-78 % . One prostate cancer patient significant decrease PSA level . There dose-limiting toxicity note either study date , although drug associate toxicity include fatigue , fever , nausea vomiting , anorexia , diarrhea thrombocytopenia . The NCI sponsoring three Phase I trials PS-341 administered IV twice weekly ( day 1 4 ) . One trial assess every week administration PS-341 patient solid tumor non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . A weekly time 4 every six week schedule evaluate patient solid tumor B cell lymphoproliferative disorder . A third trial evaluate administration schedule patient acute myeloid leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome chronic myeloid leukemia blast phase.14 These trial recently open . Based observation , PS-341 administer week 4 week 24-72 hour recovery period prior radical prostatectomy . We propose study vivo effect systemic treatment PS-341 correlative scientific marker assess apoptosis , evaluation protease protein target , angiogenesis marker . We anticipate perioperative morbidity prostatectomy perform 24-72 hour follow last drug dose . A residual drug activity may impact transiently wound heal operative blood loss effect ( present ) dissipate within short period proteasome activity recovers normal tissue . Long term effect vesico-urethral anastomosis recovery bladder erectile function expect . At time , obtain prostate within 72 hour ( ) follow last drug dose enable u evaluate multiple protein marker still influence proteasome inhibition document biologic activity drug target organ .</detailed_description>
