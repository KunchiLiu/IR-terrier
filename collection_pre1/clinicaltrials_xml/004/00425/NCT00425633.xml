	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether homeopathic potassium dichromate decrease time breathe machine amount phlegm produce lung . In addition , study look whether participant spend less time critical care unit chance place back breathing machine lessen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Homeopathic Potassium Dichromate Treat Tracheal Secretions Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prolonged mechanical ventilation associate great mortality , increase need tracheostomy , prolong length critical care stay high cost . Risk factor identify patient great risk unsuccessful extubation include cough strength , endotracheal secretion neurological status . These factor synergistic patient exhibit two determinant extubation failure rate 81 % . The risk 100 % three present compare 3 % patient risk factor . Several strategy include administration mucolytics , anti-cholinergics corticosteroid meet limited success excessive toxicity . Thus , method improve quality quantity secretion could associate decreased extubation failure great overall outcome . The recent study randomize , double blind , placebo control trial 50 critically ill ventilate patient previous history COPD tobacco use Frass et al . Five C30 pellet potassium dichromate placebo administer twice daily extubation find receive homeopathic formulation statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) tracheal secretion reduction , early extubation time short length stay critical care compare placebo counterpart . Use homeopathy critically ill would convey number advantage include lack adverse effect drug interaction , due dilute nature solution , cost effective adjunct conventional therapy . In previous trial potassium dichromate critical care patient , patient previous tobacco use history COPD include . It unknown whether result could extrapolate general critical care population . Therefore , study look safety efficacy homeopathic potassium dichromate ( Kalium Bichromicum ) v placebo . A dosing schedule five pellet every 12 hour utilized ; regimen choose base previous evidence show efficacy dose . Dosing continue patient extubated chooses withdraw study . Data collect include baseline demographic data , quantity sputum production ( baseline per day ) , number time suction required per day , duration mechanical ventilation , rate reintubation within 7 day follow extubation , critical care length stay , PaO2/ FiO2 ratio , PaCO2 twice daily , number therapeutic bronchoscopies .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18yrs old Situated Critical Care area Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre include Critical Care Unit , Cardiovascular Surgery Intensive Care Unit , Ross Tilley Burn Centre B5/D4 intensive care unit . They wean mechanical ventilation ( eg : extubated , face mask tracheostomy mask , minimal pressure support CPAP , FiO2 &lt; 0.3 ) unable transfer unit due excessive and/or persistent secretion least 48 hour . Persistent secretion define suction great every 2 hour score great 2024 `` MP '' per day . ( In Critical Care area , time patient suction , secretion quantify scale 13 , `` MP '' mucopurulent nature ) . Those evidence untreated respiratory infection infection treat less 48 hour . Those patient high dose steroid define great : Fluticasone 125ug inhaler four puff twice daily and/or Prednisone 20mg daily orally Patients multiple drug and/or environmental allergy Those patient fail give inform write consent . Those patient currently enrol another clinical trial approach participation trial last 30 day . Previous enrollment study Pregnancy woman child bear age administer pregnancy test inclusion study verify status .</criteria>
