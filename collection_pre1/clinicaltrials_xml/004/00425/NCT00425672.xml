	<brief_title>ONTAKÂ® Treating Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety ONTAK infusion patient advance refractory breast cancer . II . To evaluate effect ONTAK administration peripheral blood T-regulatory cell . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate incidence IL-2R expression tumor sample investigate correlation tumor IL-2R expression tumor response ONTAK therapy . II . To evaluate level circulate sIL-2R ONTAK therapy . III . To evaluate effect ONTAK endogenous tumor specific immunity . IV . To evaluate potential anti-tumor effect ONTAK patient advance refractory breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive ONTAK IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
