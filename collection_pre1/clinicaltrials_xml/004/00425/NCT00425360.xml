	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) together vaccine therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether chemotherapy effective without vaccine therapy treat pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study gemcitabine , capecitabine , vaccine therapy see well work compare gemcitabine capecitabine alone treat patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy telomerase peptide vaccine GV1001 administer concurrently sequentially gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine , term survival , patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . Secondary - Determine safety regimen patient . - Assess immunogenicity regimen patient . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . - Determine clinical benefit response patient treat regimen . - Determine objective response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine survival response delayed-type hypersensitivity patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This prospective , control , randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord stage disease ( locally advance vs metastatic ) ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine arm I . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) intradermally ( ID ) telomerase peptide vaccine GV1001 ID day 1 , 3 , 5 week 9 , week week 10-12 14 , month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients develop disease progression vaccine therapy , discontinue vaccine therapy restart treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm III : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine arm I . Patients also receive GM-CSF ID telomerase peptide vaccine GV1001 ID day 1 , 3 , 5 week 1 , weekly week 2 , 3 , 4 6 , month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline 8 week every 12 week study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,110 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
