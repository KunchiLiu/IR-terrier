	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect add metronidazole standard second-line therapy tuberculosis patient multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) lung . It evaluate safety tolerability metronidazole combination antituberculosis agent . Metronidazole drug widely use treat bacterial parasitic infection occur environment little oxygen human colon . Nine million new case sputum-positive tuberculosis diagnose worldwide year . Patients age 20 older symptom TB , treat tuberculosis whose disease multi-drug resistant , pregnant breast feeding may eligible study . They recruit National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital ( NMTH ) , Masan , Republic Korea . Patients undergo follow test procedure : - Collection sputum count bacteria . - Drawing blood routine blood chemistry analysis ; measuring level metronidazole ; TB lipid analysis ; test level T-cells , part immune response . - Two target positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , five high-resolution CT scan . Patients receive either 8-week course standard second-line agent plus placebo ( sugar pill ) 8-week course standard agent plus metronidazole . The subject , doctor researcher know patient take metronidazole first 2 year trial . A total 60 patient assign two cohort 30 patient . After 8 week , patient return standard care chemotherapy , accord normal procedure NMTH . Side effect metronidazole commonly report vaginal discharge , symptom Candida cervicitis vaginitis , headache , nausea vomiting , dizziness . Peripheral neuropathy , abnormal condition nerve , may also side effect . The precise incidence neuropathy unknown usually relate duration metronidazole use . It almost always reverse drug discontinue . Serious side effect , though rare , may include leukopenia thrombocytopenia ( disorder blood ) , seizures central nervous system problem , hepatitis . This study may may direct benefit participant . However , possible patient ' drug-resistant disease may effectively treat result metronidazole . The study may help identify new method measure drug effectiveness TB study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite significant vitro data metronidazole active Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) maintain anaerobic condition , utility agent evaluate carefully human disease due lack efficacy murine model tuberculosis ( TB ) . Unlike disease rodent , however , human disease characterize discrete type lesion include aerobic ( cavity ) anaerobic ( caseous necrotic nodule ) area . Recent experiment non-human primate demonstrate close caseous necrotic lesion highly anoxic , therefore , likely contain anaerobic bacillus highly susceptible metronidazole . Recent study TB-infected rabbit show metronidazole therapy highly effective animal model recapitulate feature human disease . Both study support possibility metronidazole may unique activity anaerobic sub-population bacillus human disease . Such sub-populations may responsible extended duration chemotherapy typically employed tuberculosis chemotherapy , anoxic bacteria highly resistant sterilize effect front-line tuberculosis agent . One small clinical trial metronidazole Indian population also suggest agent may significant unappreciated role control human tuberculosis . AIMS : The major aim study evaluate ability metronidazole kill anaerobic sub-population Mycobacterium tuberculosis within multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) patient . In order address sub-population context disease , study combine traditional measurement drug efficacy , include rate sputum clearance organism , functional imaging technique , [ ( 18 ) F ] -fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose -positron emission tomography - high-resolution computed tomography ( FDG-PET-HRCT ) previously apply monitoring tuberculosis chemotherapy . In addition , clinical trial evaluate tolerability preliminary efficacy metronidazole ( 500 mg three time day ( t.i.d . ) give combination standard second-line antituberculous treatment . METHODS : Type study conduct : Randomized , double-blinded , placebo control phase II study . Population Studied : The study population draw subject National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital ( NMTH ) , Changwon , Republic Korea . Subjects present NMTH previously treat first-line agent multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) , define TB isolates resistant least isoniazid rifampicin , therefore eligible second-line antituberculous drug therapy include . Treatment Regimen Treatment Period ( ) : All patient receive either : ( 1 ) 8-week course standard second-line agent plus placebo t.i.d. , ( 2 ) 8-week course standard second-line agent plus 500 mg t.i.d . metronidazole . In total , sixty subject accrue two cohort 30 patient . After 8 week , subject revert standard care ( SOC ) chemotherapy accord normal procedure NMTH . According hospital standard care , patient continue second-line medication 18-24 month follow sputum culture conversion .</detailed_description>
