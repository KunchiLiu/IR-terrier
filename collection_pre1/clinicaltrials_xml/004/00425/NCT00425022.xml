	<brief_summary>To examine feasibility VATS lobectomy clinical stage IB II non-small cell lung cancer . Success define VATS lobectomy without conversion . If success rate 90 % , VATS lobectomy consider feasible procedure clinical stage IB II non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VATS Lobectomy Clinical Stage IB II Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Video-assisted minimally invasive surgery become standard approach many abdominal surgical operation cholecystectomy fundoplication . With respect thorax , video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) accept technique biopsy lung pleura surgical treatment pneumothorax.Thoracoscopic , also term video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy become accepted safe effective procedure treat early-stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Several pilot series thoracoscopic lobectomy stage I lung cancer patient report , demonstrate low complication rate effective short-term long-term oncologic result . With increase experience , indication thoracoscopic lobectomy expand . Single Multi-institutional study demonstrate thoracoscopic lobectomy safe feasible technique , also associate decreased morbidity , include short length hospitalization chest tube duration , decrease postoperative pain , improve preservation pulmonary function , reduce inflammatory response measure low postoperative cytokine level , short recovery time , compare conventional thoracotomy . The advantage thoracoscopic lobectomy demonstrated patient clinical stage I NSCLC , strategy find particularly useful specific subset patient elderly patient poor performance status . The purpose study know whether VATS lobectomy clinical stage IB II non-small cell lung cancer possible .</detailed_description>
