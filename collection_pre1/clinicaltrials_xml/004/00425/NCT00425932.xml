	<brief_title>Impact Rituximab MRI Evidence Disease Activity Patients With Moderate Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rituximab monoclonal antibody approve treatment non-Hodgkin 's B cell lymphoma ( type cancer ) certain patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . To date , 1000 subject rheumatoid arthritis receive rituximab clinical study . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) modern sensitive method look joint people rheumatoid arthritis . It use magnetic field create image . The MRI take image 3 dimension provide good picture physician see detail . There two treatment group study equal number patient assign group . All patient receive baseline Methotrexate two intravenous infusion 2 week apart one following : - 1000 mg rituximab - placebo . Patients outcomes compare 2 group . After week 24 ( open label phase ) , patient receive rituximab rheumatoid arthritis remain active . All patient MRI dominant hand wrist without gadolinium perform baseline , 12 , 24 48 week 1.5 Tesla MRI . Some patient also additional MRI hand wrist without gadolinium time point 0.2 Tesla MRI . Comparison image two machine perform . Various blood biomarkers also examine , compare 2 treatment group correlate MRI result .</detailed_description>
