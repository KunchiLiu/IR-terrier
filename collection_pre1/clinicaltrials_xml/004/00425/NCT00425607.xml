	<brief_summary>This open label dose adjust phase II trial oral farnesyltransferase inhibitor ( FTI ) lonafarnib ( SCH66336 ) patient HGPS progeroid laminopathies . Lonafarnib give orally twice daily ( every 12 hour ) without plan break . A course define 4 month therapy . In absence significant toxicity relate drug treatment , patient may continue therapy 24 month . Patients begin treatment dosage level 115 mg/m2 allow escalate dose 150 mg/m2 therapy well tolerate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome ( HGPS ) rare `` premature age '' disease child die average age thirteen year ( range 8-20 year ) severe atherosclerosis lead stroke heart attack . It multisystem disease objective clinical marker disease progression . These include abnormality growth body composition , bone mineral density , joint function , endocrine function , alopecia , vascular disease . There effective therapy progressive deleterious aspect disorder . The gene defect cause HGPS progeroid laminopathies identify mutation gene LMNA , cod nuclear protein lamin A. Lamin A normally express differentiated cell , require posttranslational farnesylation incorporate nuclear membrane . The lamin A C-terminal peptide , include farnesyl group , subsequently cleave , mature lamin A becomes prominent component nuclear scaffold internal nuclear membrane , affect nuclear structure function . In case , HGPS sporadic autosomal dominant disease cause single base alteration ( henceforth designate G608G ) LMNA gene , create cryptic splice site give rise alter lamin A protein product 50 amino acid delete . The defective protein product HGPS ( henceforth progerin ) lack cleavage site removal C-terminal farnesylated peptide , likely produce disease via dominant negative effect nuclear structure function various cell type express lamin A . Most progeroid laminopathies cause various mutation LMNA gene , also subsequently create abnormally functioning lamin A. Lonafarnib farnesyltransferase inhibitor block post-translational farnesylation prelamin A protein target farnesylation . Farnesylation essential function mutant non-mutant lamin A protein , include progerin . Therefore , farnesyltransferase inhibitor ideal candidate treatment HGPS , cause protein ( progerin ) likely depend carry farnesyl group execute aberrant function . Both cell culture mouse model study HGPS demonstrate improve phenotype exposure FTI . In vitro , exposure HGPS skin fibroblasts progerin-transfected HeLa cell FTIs , include lonafarnib , prevents preprogerin intercalate nuclear membrane normally function , eliminates nuclear deformity . In vivo , three Progeria-like mouse model show appreciable sign toxicity FTI administration . In three model , disease significantly reduce compare age-matched control oral administration FTI . We propose clinical feature HGPS ameliorate reversed block posttranslational farnesylation via treat patient lonafarnib . We hypothesize reduction quantity functional progerin , case progeroid laminopathies , abnormal lamin protein , improve disease sign , symptom outcome . We also hypothesize toxicity profile FTI inhibition use lonafarnib similar observe child malignant brain tumor treat compound .</detailed_description>
