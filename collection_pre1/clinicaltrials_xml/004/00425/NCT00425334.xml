	<brief_title>Safety Study HemospanÂ® Prostatectomy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Donor ( allogeneic ) blood transfusion often require and/or elective surgery maintain adequate hemoglobin concentration , prevent tissue ischemia ( inadequate perfusion ) , treat hypotension ( low blood pressure ) , compensate fluid shift . Hemospan novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier plasma expander specifically develop perfuse oxygenate tissue risk ischemia hypoxia ( insufficient oxygenation ) . As result molecular size oxygen dissociation characteristic , Hemospan selectively off-loads oxygen tissue predispose low oxygen tension . In preclinical study Hemospan find free significant toxicity variety animal specie . These study also demonstrate Hemospan may ideally suit application , may even perform good blood certain situation . Hemospan evaluate three clinical study , include 90-patient multi-center Phase II orthopedic surgery trial complete Sweden 2005 . No serious adverse event attributable Hemospan note trial . Sangart develop Hemospan oxygen-carrying plasma expander hemodiluent patient undergo elective surgical procedure . In current Phase II study prostatectomy patient , administration Hemospan ( Treatment ) Ringer 's lactate ( Controls ) occur approximately 250 mL surgical blood loss occur . Study evaluation include clinical observation , subjective symptom , vital sign , ECG , pulmonary hemodynamics ( TEE ) , serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis , renal function , oxygenation measurement , well safety follow-up assessment 4-6 week surgery . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review safety data follow completion dose cohort .</detailed_description>
