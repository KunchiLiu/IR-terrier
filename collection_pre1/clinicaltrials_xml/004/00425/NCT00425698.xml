	<detailed_description>Erythropoietin ( EPO ) pleiotropic effect well beyond maintenance red blood cell mass . In embryo , EPO major regulator vascular formation organ growth , EPO receptor find almost every embryonic tissue . EPO receptor also exist many adult tissue include renal tissue , even notion autocrine paracrine EPO system raise . Although peritubular fibroblast major adult site EPO production , EPO receptor demonstrate many kidney cell type , e.g . proximal tubule epithelial cell , mesangial cell , glomerulus . Moreover , EPO important cytoprotective effect various cell line organ , protection ischemic injury inhibition apoptotic death-related pathway report brain , heart renal tissue . The intracellular pathway involve favourable EPO effect may involve nuclear translocation transcription factor NF- B , JAK2 phosphorylation phosphorylation Akt ( protein kinase B ) . A recent experimental study reveal cobalt administration rat cause up-regulation EPO , diminish degree renal injury cause ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) , suggest EPO may also play important role renal ischemic preconditioning . Indeed , subsequent study different laboratory demonstrate precondition recombinant human EPO ( rHuEPO ) protective I/R injury rodent . In respect data specific protective effect rHuEPO analogue endothelial cell glomeruli particular interest . Furthermore , administration rHuEPO may protective effect vascular level , also potential regeneration , since EPO also stimulate proliferation differentiation regenerative cell endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) . Renal ischemia , whether cause shock surgery , major cause acute renal failure ( ARF ) man . In respect kidney transplantation classical model ARF due I/R injury , since transplant organ connect recipient blood supply usually several hour `` cold ischemia '' . Although reperfusion essential survival ischemic tissue , also initiate complex interrelated sequence event result injury eventual death renal cell result combination apoptosis necrosis . Apoptotic cell death document human biopsy renal I/R , inhibition apoptotic signalling cell death ameliorates associate injury inflammation experimental model ischemic ARF . Similarly , I/R damage transplant kidney thought major factor limit renal function successful transplantation .</detailed_description>
