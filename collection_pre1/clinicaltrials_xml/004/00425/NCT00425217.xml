	<brief_summary>Membranous glomerulopathy ( MN ) common immune-mediated glomerular disease lead cause nephrotic syndrome Caucasian adult . 1 Because frequency , remain second third cause end-stage renal disease cause primary glomerulonephritis . 2 At presentation , 70 % 80 % patient nephrotic syndrome . 1 , 3 , 4 Proteinuria great 2.0 gram per day find &gt; 80 % patient presentation , great 10 gram find many 30 % . 5 The disease affect patient age , often diagnose middle age peak incidence fourth fifth decade life . There close two-to-one predominance male female diagnose disease . Idiopathic MN affect race . Current therapeutic option include corticosteroid alone combination alkylating agent , cyclosporin A , mycophenolate mofetil . The widely recognize , best-validated regimen combination therapy corticosteroid alkylating agent , use associate significant adverse effect . Recent meta-analysis confirm present day treatment far ideal 6 Thus , come surprise outcome MN substantially improve past 30 year , 40 % patient still progress end-stage renal failure . 7 Like glomerular disease amount protein urine correlate well long term prognosis . Thus , parameter use previous study , use study , primary indicator effectiveness therapy . We propose pilot study test hypothesis selective B lymphocyte depletion result disappearance pathogenic antibody induction remission nephrotic syndrome patient idiopathic membranous nephropathy . Our population 10 adult . The study conduct Nephrology Divisions Mayo Clinic Rochester , Jacksonville , Scottsdale . We enroll patient GFR 25 ml/min estimate creatinine clearance proteinuria &gt; 4g/24h , receive ACEI ARB BP control &lt; 130/80 mmHg . Patients receive Rituximab 1g Day 1 15 . Patients follow 1 year follow completion treatment . The primary outcome change urinary protein excretion 6 month . Secondary outcome change serum albumin , serum lipid ? profile , number partial remission , time remission , incidence relapse . We also perform pharmacokinetic study evaluate effect proteinuria bio-availability effect drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There convince evidence experimental human study MN mediate deposition IgG antibodies subepithelial aspect GBM . More debatable , mechanism ( ) deposition antibody location . Given key role IgG antibodies MN , reasonable postulate suppression antibody production deplete B cell and/or plasma cell may improve even resolve glomerular pathology reflect reduction proteinuria . There evidence strategy effective treatment antibody-mediated disease preliminary study MN promising . Data animal study suggest immune deposition result B cell activation promote injury glomerular filter barrier proteinuria.103 In human , discuss , evidence therapy direct B cell , e.g . cyclophosphamide , effective MN . Cyclophosphamide strike direct effect B cell function , suppress secretion immunoglobulins.104 Thus , case could make use agent capable depleting B cell , therefore halt production nephrotoxic immunoglobulin . This approach could stop pathogenic event initial stage potentially result resolution pathological process . The rationale use approach substantiate fact Th2 pathway antibody response activate inhibition B cell pathogenic antibody strictly associate beneficial effect immunosuppressive drug experimental MN . This open-label Phase I/II pilot study . Patients receive Rituximab total dose 1g Day 1 Day 15 accord infusion guideline . Patient experience complete clinical response ( per response criterion outline ) , AND Patient subsequently experience clinical relapse , define return proteinuria 4 g/24h , CD20+ cell count normalize , receive second course Rituximab . Patients relapse remain B cell deplete retreat .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible study entry : Membranous Nephropathy diagnostic biopsy perform within last 3 year . Renal biopsy slide electron photomicrograph review study investigator , must confirm diagnosis MN . Age &amp; # 61619 ; 18 year . Proteinuria measure via Uprot/UCr ratio &gt; 4.0 spot sample 24hour urine collection , despite ACE inhibitor / ARB treatment . The choice urine protein/creatinine ratio accord recently develop National Kidney Foundation Chronic Kidney Disease ( NKFCKD ) guidelines.107 The NKFCKD guideline advocate urine protein/creatinine ratio prefer method evaluation urinary protein excretion adult child . Patients need treat ACEI and/or ARB , least 3 month prior enrollment adequately control blood pressure ( BP &lt; 140/80 mm Hg &gt; 75 % reading ) . Women must postmenopausal , surgically sterile practice medically approve method contraception . Patients thromboembolic complication and/or clinical sign NS control conventional medical treatment enter immunosuppressive portion protocol ( Rituxan treatment ) without 3 month ACE/ARB treatment ( high risk patient ) . Able willing give write informed consent comply requirement study protocol Adequate renal function indicate estimate GFR &amp; # 8805 ; 25 ml/min per 1.73m2 and/or serum creatinine &lt; 4.0 mg/dL presence ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy . The GFR estimate use 4 variable MDRD equation publish NKFCKD guideline . The NKFCKD guideline also promote use estimate GFR ( GFRest ) value rather serum creatinine level creatinine clearance measurement prefer noninvasive method determine glomerular filtration rates.107 We opt use approach rather much expensive invasive technique employ clearance measurement exogenous substance ( inulin iothalamate ) since likelihood detect significant change GFR short term study remote matter method choose . The inclusion and/or serum creatinine &lt; 4.0 mg/dL cover possibility incomplete 24hour collection time baseline creatinine clearance . ) Adequate liver function , indicate bilirubin , AST , alkaline phosphatase level ( &lt; 2.5 time upper normal limit ) . Negative serum pregnancy test ( woman child bear age ) Men woman reproductive potential must agree use acceptable method birth control treatment twelve month ( 1 year ) completion treatment period 21 month undergoing retreatment .</criteria>
