	<detailed_description>SHIATSU ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA Protocol Open Pilot Study 1 . Background Schizophrenia severe , chronic mental illness affect approximately 1 % population worldwide . While pharmacological treatment available advance considerably last fifty year , limit offer patient , especially term improve dysphoria , sleep , mood , avolition , social functioning , anhedonia , contribute greatly everyday misery patient . Furthermore , antipsychotic drug induce side effect parkinsonism , akathisias , orofacial dyskinesia , dystonias , associate muscle pain , stiffness . The treatment use side effect anticholinergic drug ( e.g . trihexyphenidyl ) , benzodiazepine , beta blocker . The number variety drug suggest clinician know unfortunately true : magic bullet symptom . These drug also innocent , cause side effect , contribute polypharmacy , carry financial cost . Schizophrenia , , remain debilitate illness whose treatment result often partial may produce unpleasant side-effects . New approach supplement standard modality ought consider . Shiatsu , acupressure , holistic form medicine originate Japan widely practice throughout world . Shiatsu involve applying pressure `` meridian '' body , much like acupuncture without needle . The shiatsu therapist view whole body interconnect - stiffness one part may reflect problem another , emotional disharmony . In accordance WHO definition health `` state complete physical , mental social well-being merely absence disease infirmity , '' shiatsu massage aim improve overall well-being recipient manipulate body . Shiatsu theory base traditional Chinese medicine , posit meridians life force ( chi ) run body , aim optimize health manipulating body maximal alignment . Disease , accord approach , accumulation damage stress cause body tense various area , lead health disturbance . The treatment aim loosen tense muscle tendon restore balance body . Shiatsu also involve diagnostic process design locate source problem . The main four area process patient 's appearance , his/her voice , specific complaint medical history patient , touch diagnosis . The touch meant reveal area excess lack energy body internal organ autonomic nervous system . Treatment individualize accord finding examination . Goals treatment , addition release muscle tendon tension protect structure , help patient acquire awareness body psyche order avoid recurrence problem , identify life stressor ( mental physical ) , strengthen patient 's overall energy flow resilience disease . The two field shiatsu do-in anma . Do-in exercise involve stretch part body combine breathing exercise order loosen tense joint improve general circulation . Anma shiatsu familiar massage-type treatment . However , perform comfort pleasure , Western massage , rather type medical treatment . It perform fully dress patient , direct pressure apply practitioner 's finger . Both diagnosis treatment perform way , finding exam direct action . How might effect shiatsu explain term Western medicine ? In order answer , consider research do shiatsu acupuncture well , extensively examine . This justified two reason : first , shiatsu acupuncture share understand human function disease , include core concept chi meridian , accordingly recognize point along body applying pressure ( shiatsu ) needle ( acupuncture ) . Secondly , study conduct test effectiveness alternative remedy , acupressure acupuncture often combine ( e.g . Vachiramon &amp; Wang , 2005 ; Melchart et al , 2006 ) . 2 . Biological basis shiatsu Medical research attempt understand Chinese medicine work effect . Several theory develop may relevance schizophrenia . 1 . Endorphins : The establish effect acupuncture release endorphins , endogenous opioid neuropeptides ( Hökfelt , 1991 ; Sjölund et al , 1977 ) . Endorphin release appear closely related analgesic effect acupuncture . Endorphins also promote general feel well reduction tension salutary effect treat mental illness . 2 . Cytokines : Cytokines mediate inflammatory response . They also promote endorphin release pituitary ( Van der Meer et al , 1996 ) . Drzyzga et al ( 2006 ) review possible connection cytokine one hand , neuropathological change , schizophrenia , anti-psychotic medication mechanism action . A grow body evidence suggest cytokinin mediate neuropathological change schizophrenia antipsychotic effect medication . Acupuncture show affect cytokine system animal ( Liu et al , 2004 ) human ( Petti et al , 2002 ) study . The cytokine system theoretically pathway acupuncture could produce therapeutic effect upon schizophrenia . 3 . Glutamatergic mechanism gain prominence important factor pathogenesis treatment schizophrenia . In experiment animal , N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist synergistically enhance anti-nociceptive effect electro-acupuncture ( Zhang et al , 2002 ) . Assessing relationship glutamatergic activity acupuncture effect could provide important information therapeutic mechanism action . 4 . Neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) : NPY 's role CNS well understood . However , appreciation possible role NPY pathogenesis severe mental disorder increase recent year . NPY mRNA level significantly reduce frontal cortex patient schizophrenia bipolar disorder ( Kuromitsu et al , 2001 ) . NPY also show play role mediate effect antipsychotic medication , animal ( Huang et al , 2006 ) human study ( Obuchowicz et al , 2004 ) . Interestingly , effect NPY may mediate glutamatergic mechanism ( Rosse &amp; Deutsch , 2004 ) . This relevant study NPY level saliva find increase follow acupuncture treatment ( Dawidson et al , 1998 ) . This , , another possible mechanism acupuncture clinically relevant treatment schizophrenia . Studies already carry assess effectiveness Chinese medicine treatment schizophrenia . In recent review five study Cochrane Database ( Rathbone &amp; Xia , 2005 ) , acupuncture adjuvant therapy provide anti-psychotic medication show evidence improve outcomes clinical rating scale side effect profile , though overall evidence deem insufficient reach definite conclusion , `` comprehensive better design study '' recommend . A second review ( Moffet , 2006 ) clinical trial acupuncture various medical disorder make important observation often , meaningful physiological rationale provide proposed effectiveness treatment . Proposing rationale enables investigator suggest testable causal hypothesis contribute knowledge technique 's mechanism action . In current study focus assessment glutamatergic system neurophysiological ( prepulse inhibition ) test use prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) . In paradigm , subject present auditory stimulus , `` pre-pulse '' , would ordinarily cause subject blink . Following initial prepulse tenth second come second , loud stimulus , pulse , would cause blink preceded prepulse . Pre-pulse inhibition , measure sensory gating filtering , determine reduction blink response pulse follow pre-pulse compare blink response without preparatory pre-pulse . Prepulse inhibition startle response , reliably demonstrate human animal ( rev . Braff et al. , 2001 ; Swerdlow et al. , 2001 ) , preattentive , automatic process . Schizophrenia patient repeatedly show reduced inhibition startle reflex PPI ( rev . Geyer et al. , 2001 ) . This loss normal PPI think measure deficient sensorimotor gating ( Braff Geyer , 1990 ) underlies sensory flood cognitive fragmentation patient ( McGhie Chapman , 1961 ) . Furthermore , study report PPI deficit may correlate symptom severity cognitive functional impairment schizophrenia may partially completely resolve antipsychotic drug treatment ( rev . Braff et al. , 2001 ) . One propose model PPI hypothesize involvement glutamatergic , mainly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) -mediated neurotransmission . Glutamate key inhibitory neurotransmitter . Glutamatergic neurotransmission may correlate efficiency sensory gating ( Swerdlow Geyer , 1999 ) . Glutamatergic synapses implicate regulation PPI rodent ( Swerdlow et al. , 2001 ) . In light possible connection PPI glutamatergic system , decide administer PPI subject shiatsu treatment order ass whether ameliorate effect shiatsu , note involve glutamatergic mechanism , may correlate change PPI . We also assess neurocognitive function use battery test develop specifically use assess patient schizophrenia . 3 . Study goal : Based upon rationale suggest utilizing shiatsu treatment schizophrenia , base upon study already perform , propose pilot study examine efficacy shiatsu adjuvant therapy antipsychotic treatment patient schizophrenia . The goal study several : 1 . To improve patient ' symptom 2 . To ameliorate neuromuscular side effect produce standard anti-psychotic treatment 3 . To provide patient tools deal stress illness 4 . To provide basis investigation effect shiatsu 4 . Methodology We propose open pilot study total 20 patient enrol . These patient draw inpatient psychiatric ward Herzog Hospital . They recruit treat physician facility . All patient would fully inform experimental treatment , goal , possible outcome . Either participant , relevant court-appointed guardian , require provide inform consent . Participants course free discontinue participation reason time . 4.1 Inclusion Criteria : 1 . DSM-IV-R diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder 2 . Ages 18 3 . Clinical status stable , reflect least one month drug treatment without change anti-psychotic drug dosage . 4 . Ability cooperate 40-minute session 4.2 Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Active fracture orthopedic problem 2 . Skin condition render treatment unsafe painful 3 . Active infection skin soft tissue , cellulitis 4 . Any acute illness medical condition ( e.g . solid tissue malignancy ) shiatsu may contraindicate . 4.3 Study design Upon inclusion trial , participant receive shiatsu treatment , consist two individual weekly 40-minute shiatsu treatment session four week . The shiatsu provider train certified Tsabar College , alternative medicine training institute , least two year post-training experience shiatsu . Each patient receive treatment provider duration treatment . Provider patient gender . The patient clothe shirt full-length trouser skirt shiatsu . Treatment include contact sensitive region body , chest ( work female ) , pelvic , inner thigh region , region body patient comfortable . Standard pharmacotherapy provide need treatment period . Medication dosage change . If necessary , benzodiazepine administer require . 4.4 Rescue strategy withdrawal research In case exacerbation , define increase 2 point BPRS ( 4 6 individual item list ) , one point CGI , patient may receive clothiapine dose 80 mg/day 3 day within 14-day period . In case relapse , define increase 3 point BPRS ( 5 7 somatic concern , conceptual disorganization , hostility , suspiciousness , hallucinatory behavior unusual thought content ) , 2 point CGI , patient withdrawn study appropriate treatment institute . Furthermore , patient deteriorates clinically way may relate treatment ( e.g . paranoid fantasy direct towards shiatsu therapist ) , research protocol individual discontinue . Significant emergent medical problem also lead withdrawal patient research . 4.5 Outcome measure The following assessment include : 1 . Medication . Use SOS benzodiazepine : quantity frequency 2 . Clinical rating scale 1 . PANSS 2 . CGI 3 . NOSIE 4 . Hamilton Scales depression anxiety 2 . Side effect scale : 1 . Simpson Angus Scale 2 . AIMS scale 3 . UKU scale 3 . Neurophysiological testing : Prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) . This performed follow : The eyeblink component acoustic startle reflex measure use electromyography obicularis oculi muscle . Two electrode ( 6 mm ) Ag/AgCl electrodes fill electrode gel ( parker laboratories inc. ) position right patient 's right eye , obicularis oculi muscle . Electrodes place minimize potential electro-oculogram artifact . Specifically , 1 electrode place approximately 1 cm lateral 0.5 cm lateral canthus , second electrode place approximately 1.5 cm slightly medial first electrode , conform location obicularis oculi fiber . A ground electrode place behind right ear mastoid . All resistance le 10 kOhm . Electrodes fix skin close possible use adhesive collar . All acoustic stimulus deliver binaurally headphone ( Maico , TDH-39-P ) . Subjects seat comfortably softly light informed procedure . The prepulse startle stimuli burst white noise fix interstimulus interval 30 , 60 120 m measure PPI 15 m 4500 m measure PPF . The startle session begin 5-minute acclimation period 70-dB white noise , continue throughout session , follow six trial block . Block 1 consist six pulse-alone trial . Blocks 2 3 consist 32 trial , contain 8 pulse-alone 24 prepulse-pulse trial present pseudorandom order . Block 4 consist six pulse-alone trial . Block 5 consist six pulse-alone trial 12 prepulse-pulse trial block 6 consist six pulse alone trial . The first , forth sixth block measure habituation well startle response , second third block measure startle response PPI fifth block measure PPF . The pulse alone stimulus 40 ms presentation 115dB white noise , prepulse stimulus 20 m ( except 15 m interval stimulus last 5 m ) presentation 86 dB noise , 70 dB continuous background noise . Acoustic stimulus consist pulse alone , prepulse pulse , stimulus trial present fixed pseudorandom order . Electromyographic activity record electrode direct customized electromyographic amplifier computerized startle response monitoring system digitization analysis ( SR-LAB ; San Diego Instruments Inc , San Diego , Calif ) . The system record 1000 one-ms reading start onset startle stimulus . Acoustic startle prepulse stimulus present binaurally headphone . 4 . Neurocognitive testing : This perform use NIMH 's Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia ( MATRICS ) Consensus Cognitive Battery Clinical Trials . This recently-developed battery recommend use clinical trial putative cognition-enhancing agent schizophrenia . The MATRICS battery , include Hebrew translation relevant test , presently use Stanley Foundation-sponsored Israel Multicenter D-Serine Trial ( IMSER ) ( Dr. Heresco-Levy - Co-Principal Investigator ) implement trained psychologist presently participate project . 5 . Hypothesis : Shiatsu adjuvant therapy improve psychiatric motor symptom patient four week therapy . 6.1 Potential Benefits : Shiatsu treatment pleasant experience involve applying pressure manually various point body . Furthermore , research lead time spent staff patient , patient 's benefit . Beyond anticipate shiatsu benefit , alongside standard pharmacological treatment continue , enhance patient 's wellbeing reduce medication side effect . 6.2 Potential Adverse Effects : Shiatsu know carry significant risk patient . It may rarely cause soreness , muscle cramp , local pain . Patients informed possibility instruct notify shiatsu therapist discomfort occur treatment . Psychological distress may arouse human contact touch occurs treatment . Patients advise possibility well . Patients wish reason discontinue research course withdrawn study . 6.3 Significance study : The treatment schizophrenia could benefit new modality complement exist approach . To date , study systemically evaluate use shiatsu treat schizophrenia , one study evaluate shiatsu population drug induce myospasm . Due chronic nature disease severe impairment quality life , mean sought combat suffer inherent disease . Shiatsu may cost-effective , pleasant , well-tolerated treatment schizophrenia symptom . This study may pave way similar study psychiatric patient . 7 . References Braff DL , Geyer MA . ( 1990 ) . Sensorimotor gate schizophrenia : human animal model study .
