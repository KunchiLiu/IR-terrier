	<detailed_description>NT-proBNP member natriuretic hormone family play important role regulation extracellular fluid volume blood pressure.It secrete cardiac ventricle myocytes response myocardial stress . This hormone serve marker ventricular dysfunction adult role newborn especially preterm infant well study yet . Following birth healthy infant surge NT-proBNP level follow rapid decrease . One explanation surge transition hemodynamics fetal circulation postnatal one . Few study conduct area show association NT-proBNP level patency ductus arteriosus respiratory distress syndrome newborn . Cardiac troponin T ( cTnT ) specific cardiac protein serve specific indicator cardiac damage adult , usually detect birth follow myocardial injury serum level slowly rise generally detectable least 4 hour onset injury . There `` gold standard '' test diagnosis hemodynamic instability low birth weight infant . Myocardial dysfunction think major cause condition VLBW population . Since condition associate severe short long term morbidity early recognition specific treatment may detrimental . We hypothesize NT-proBNP cTnT level may serve accurate marker diagnosis , monitoring , outcome prediction VLBW infant first day life , method currently use ( blood pressure , urine output etc . )</detailed_description>
