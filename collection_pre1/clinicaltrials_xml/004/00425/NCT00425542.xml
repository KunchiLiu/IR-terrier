	<brief_title>Safety Study Outpatient Treatment Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) worldwide health problem , estimate incidence 69 case per 100,000 person annually . In U.S. , 101,000 patient hospitalized primary diagnosis PE 2002 , result direct medical cost $ 720 million . There grow evidence outpatient treatment low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) effective safe option 50 % patient non-massive PE . Despite evidence , outpatient treatment PE uncommon ( 1 ) explicit criterion identify patient low-risk adverse medical outcome available , ( 2 ) randomize trial demonstrate effectiveness safety outpatient treatment perform . We develop clinical prognostic model accurately identify patient PE low-risk short-term mortality , symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , major bleeding . This model provide clinician easily apply , explicit risk stratification tool patient PE , address key barrier outpatient treatment . The broad objective clinical trial address major barrier outpatient treatment low-risk patient non-massive PE , effectiveness safety outpatient management . We randomize low-risk patient ( identify use prognostic model ) PE hospital emergency department receive outpatient inpatient treatment LMWH ≥5 day , follow oral anticoagulation . The specific aim project compare ( 1 ) frequency recurrent VTE , ( 2 ) frequency major bleed all-cause mortality , ( 3 ) medical resource utilization patient satisfaction care among patient randomize receive outpatient inpatient treatment LMWH . The primary study outcome rate symptomatic recurrent VTE 3 month randomization . The secondary outcome rate major bleed all-cause mortality . The ancillary outcome medical resource utilization patient satisfaction care . The hypothesis guide trial outpatient treatment LMWH effective safe inpatient treatment LMWH , also associate reduce medical resource utilization increase patient satisfaction care . This study innovative translates validate prognostic model clinical practice represent first direct comparison outpatient versus inpatient treatment low-risk patient PE . Successful completion project provide strong scientific basis treat low-risk patient PE outpatient setting . Outpatient management low-risk patient PE likely improve quality efficiency care reduce resource utilization increase patient satisfaction care . Our finding importance physician , hospital , policy-makers commit optimize patient safety provide high-quality , cost-effective care .</detailed_description>
