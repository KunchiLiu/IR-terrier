	<brief_summary>The main purpose study assess effectiveness human simulation training leadership , cognitive , psychomotor skill require lead medical crisis management team . All participant study trainee University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) Multi-Disciplinary Critical Care Training Program ( MCCTP . ) All trainee receive standard critical care medicine-training curriculum include basic airway management , management hypotension , unstable cardiac arrhythmia , difficult airway management crisis team training . The participant also complete six month baseline clinical training , include respond medical emergency UPMC . The specific aim study : 1 . To assess effectiveness Human Simulation Training ( HST ) educational tool teach medical crisis management . 2 . To determine effect HST objective measure performance domains communication , leadership , cognition psychomotor skill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use Medical Emergency Teams ( METS ) handle in-hospital medical crisis decrease mortality improve patient safety . Adverse in-hospital event occur 4-17 % hospital admission . Of , 70 % think preventable . The serious adverse in-hospital event unexpected cardiac arrest carry mortality rate 50-80 % [ 1 ] . One approach reduce adverse event use METS . Unlike traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation team , respond cardiac arrest , METS respond medical crisis early aim prevent progression problem unstable situation . The implementation METS find decrease number unexpected cardiac arrest , intensive care unit transfer in-hospital mortality [ 1 ] . Bellomo et al . find implementation MET decrease hospital mortality also decrease incidence post-operative complication [ 2 ] . As integral part MET , critical care physician must communication leadership skill effectively manage team , cognitive skill adequately assess/judge situation guide plan action , psychomotor skill perform necessary procedure . Existing method teach medical crisis management inadequate . The instruction medical trainee management acute medical crisis often do didactic teaching , problem base learning , apprenticeship . It uncommon trainee 's first experience manage medical crisis real patient experience real medical crisis significant consequence . This form training limit clearly sub-optimal many reason . Didactic training problem base learning may useful instill medical knowledge often inadequate teach communication skill critical thinking involve manage medical crisis . Further , urgency complexity medical crisis well understood without first-hand experience . In general , although medical crisis relatively common , trainee get limited opportunity repetition require hone management skill . Some medical crisis , respiratory distress difficult airway , extremely rare often experienced trainee . Moreover , occur , trainee may enough supervision hence receive appropriate feedback . Thirdly , clinical apprenticeship provide standardization training feedback trainee . Lastly , trainee allow view consequence error make manage medical crisis supervisor intervene prevent patient injury harm [ 3-6 ] . HST use educational tool teach medical crisis management . Simulation training use field , aviation military , train people complex task potentially dangerous consequence [ 7-13 ] . A curriculum use HST may useful surpass limitation traditional training note [ 14 ] . The full body human simulator Laerdal 's Sim Man , program present wide range physiologic condition physical exam finding . Using human simulator , wide variety medical crisis program recreate real-life situation . The human simulator also allow re-creation clinically important rare situation . The human simulator also allow trainee manage medical crisis repetitively satisfactory level proficiency reach . Most importantly , HST allow trainee repetitively experience dangerous situation practice crisis management skill . Trainees benefit see management error run course without place patient risk . HST allow provide immediate feedback . This technology portable hence allow trainee various institution within particular region standardize training feedback . The 1999 Institute Medicine Report , `` To Err Human , '' challenge medical community confront issue medical error . One innovative approach mention performance improvement healthcare training use human simulator [ 15 ] . Human Simulators valuable valid performance evaluation tool . Human simulator long use field medicine evaluation . In particular , field anesthesia take lead term use advanced full body simulator resident physician training evaluation . Instructors field anesthesia use human simulator re-create dangerous complex intra-operative crisis help trainee acquire , test , practice skill crisis resource management without place patient risk [ 16-18 ] . By use evaluation technique videotape review checklist , anesthesia instructor able assess behavioral technical performance trainee [ 18-21 ] . The effectiveness HST training tool medical crisis management need explore . Due success human simulation educational tool anesthesia crisis , HST use tool training medical emergency team deal medical crisis . Lighthall et al . show HST use teach crisis management internal medicine resident [ 22 ] . This study show majority participant felt simulator train educational value , quantify performance technical non-technical skill . DeVita et al . look effect HST improve crisis team skill . This study find repeat experience use simulator immediate feedback improve team performance term correctly complete step necessary patient/simulator survival [ 23 ] . There study , look whether HST improve crisis management skill randomize study design . 2.2 Significance The field simulation education highly evolve high-risk industry aviation nuclear power plant . Its time come medical education , particularly emerge emphasis improve patient safety . Proven practical outcome base educational program need support cultural change necessary influence change field education clinically relevant domain medical crisis resource management . Medical crisis management skills essential function METS . HST useful tool safely re-create medical crisis teach evaluate trainee skill . Although HST widely study anesthesia crisis management , study look effect HST medical crisis management skill . We feel study help determine effect , HST communication , leadership , cognitive psychomotor skill level need effective medical crisis management . The participant prospective , blind , randomize cross trial consent critical care trainee MCCTP UPMC ( Appendix 1 consent form ) . All participant similar baseline education basic airway management , management cardiovascular emergency , difficult airway management testing occur . Further , participant similar clinical experience critical care trainee participate METS UPMC . Each participant undergo baseline test use HST . Using 4 simulated clinical scenario use human simulator test participant . Participants randomize two group . Control group ( A ) receive training , intervention group ( B ) receive HST curriculum medical crisis management . The group test interval 1 month use 4 different simulate clinical scenario . The group cross . The original control group ( A ) receive HST original intervention group ( B ) receive training . These two group test use third new set simulate clinical scenario . This study design summarize Appendix 2 . Both test intervention occur Peter Winter Institute Simulation , Education Research ( WISER Center ) . All instructor evaluator critical care faculty senior fellow undergone train WISER familiar simulation teach evaluation . The four medical crisis scenario use test design represent common medical crisis experience UPMC . Each scenario program Laerdal SimMan human simulator . The basic physiologic problem expect response participant phase test ; however , script presentation varied prevent pattern recognition . Participant performance evaluate use checklist expect action determine investigator . Each item represent communication skill , cognitive skill psychomotor skill . A total score well domain specific score record end test session participant . Blinded evaluator perform evaluation . The intervention study HST Curriculum . The curriculum consist two part . One didactic review crisis management principle . The second part simulation-based curriculum consist two scenario . Each participant undergo scenario receive immediate feedback regard communication , cognitive psychomotor performance .</detailed_description>
