	<brief_summary>Asthma smoke pregnancy cause significant morbidity mother offspring . Asthma represent common respiratory disorder pregnancy smoke rate pregnancy range 15-30 % United States . Maternal asthma smoke pregnancy show increase rate intrauterine growth retardation preterm delivery , well increase risk wheeze , asthma , respiratory infection , otitis medium child . However , control asthmatic pregnancy similar pregnancy outcomes non-asthmatic pregnancy . Measurement fractional concentration exhale nitric oxide ( FENO ) new , easily perform , non-invasive method use assess airway inflammation adult child . The long term goal study establish baseline FENO value monitor airway disease pregnant asthmatic , pregnant smoker pregnant control , correlate level inflammatory marker mother offspring . These value correlate current method diagnose monitor disease control patient . The use FENO level pregnant asthmatic may prove good method monitor disease control titrate steroid dos population . Finally , study may identify child high risk develop asthma allergic disease . This could serve identify factor may modify prevent limit development diseases population .</brief_summary>
