	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate effectiveness metoprolol , `` beta blocker , '' treat patient hospital cardiac arrest . It give intravenously ( give vein ) . The subject take part study 18 year age old , experience cardiac arrest hospital , life threaten situation . Patients develop cardiac arrest require prompt electrical defibrillation ( electrical shock ) restore normal beating rhythm heart . In patient respond electrical defibrillation , current standard care recommend use medication show unknown benefit . Some people recover cardiac arrest , many people . We want learn whether give metoprolol improve survival patient cardiac arrest . A total 100 patient enrol study . Patients receive either standard care drug epinephrine standard care plus metoprolol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias Refractory To Shock With Beta Blockers : The SHOCK BLOCK Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) catastrophic event commonly result acute ventricular tachyarrhythmias ( abnormal lethal heart rhythm ) . It often trigger acute coronary event , may occur person without know cardiac disease association structural heart disease . Advanced therapy thrombolytic agent , percutaneous coronary intervention , implantable cardioverter defibrillator value thousand victim survive . Many instance SCD predict intervention direct toward general population would apply estimated 1000 person every 1 person SCD might prevent . Thus , would reasonable develop new treatment strategy improve response resuscitative effort . Prompt electrical defibrillation ( electrical shock ) treatment choice person develop SCD due ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) pulseless ventricular tachycardia ( pVT ) . However , 25 % cardiac arrest , patient develop shock resistant VF , define VF persist beyond three defibrillation attempt , 87-97 % patient die . Medical therapy , include antiarrhythmic agent , sympathomimetic agent ( i.e . stimulant ) , buffer relegate secondary role since little evidence benefit use consider indeterminate class IIB . Furthermore , `` Guidelines 2000 Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Emergency Cardiovascular Care '' American Heart Association International Liaison Committee Resuscitation recommend antiarrhythmic drug `` acceptable '' `` probably helpful '' treatment VF persist three external defibrillation shock . It previously report survival rate hospital patient suffer cardiac arrest epinephrine require 6 % . Furthermore , Dorian et al report survival hospital admission 22.8 % patient suffer hospital cardiac arrest receive amiodarone . It believe acute effect amiodarone due class II beta block effect drug . Resuscitation consider successful survivor disable cognitive function . The American Heart Association/International Liaison Committee Resuscitation guideline state duration cardiac arrest &gt; 8 10 minute , frequency significant , permanent neurologic damage become unacceptably high . Newer treatment modality need improve patient outcome . Epinephrine use cardiopulmonary resuscitation 100 year yet use become controversial associate increased myocardial oxygen consumption , ventricular tachyarrhythmias , myocardial dysfunction period resuscitation . The current International Guidelines Emergency Cardiac Care cite epinephrine vasopressin acceptable vasopressor drug treatment refractory VF neither drug acknowledge proven benefit . Beta blocker might improve patient outcomes blunt adverse affect hyperadrenergic state occurs cardiac arrest improve balance myocardial oxygen supply demand . Ditchey et al show animal model pretreatment beta blocker prior cardiac arrest follow standard epinephrine therapy result reduce myocardial injury CPR without compromise successful defibrillation post resuscitation leave ventricular function . The current research protocol formulate attempt develop new treatment option patient develop in-hospital VF pVT arrest refractory electrical defibrillation specific goal improve patient outcome . The trial utilize pre-filled , blind syrinx Metoprolol patient develop in-hospital cardiac arrest due ventricular fibrillation pulseless ventricular tachycardia ( see study protocol ) . Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) claim approximately 250,000 person annually United States . Ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) pulseless ventricular tachycardia ( pVT ) appear responsible 25-35 % hospital episode sudden cardiac death . The reported average survival hospital discharge follow in-hospital arrest poor approximately 14-17 % despite development widespread implementation basic advance cardiac life support . Current American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline recommend prompt electrical defibrillation reestablish organize electrical activity . Increasing duration VF ( i.e . `` shock resistant VF '' ) result two major adverse effect . First , increase duration reduce ability terminate arrhythmia8 . Second , VF continue four minute , irreversible damage central nervous system organ . Despite aggressive effort , successful resuscitation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occur one third patient 10 % patient ultimately discharge hospital , many neurologically impaired . Also , outcome patient suffer in-hospital cardiac arrest poor report survival hospital discharge rate 10-15 % . Thus , despite improvement advance treatment heart disease , outcome patient experience SCD remain poor . Prompt early defibrillation VF pVT become standard care . Drug therapy shock resistant VF pVT relegate secondary role since little evidence agent benefit . As result , use consider indeterminate class IIB . In addition , cardiac arrest cardiopulmonary resuscitation extreme form stress lead high catecholamine level ever record human experimental animal model . Endogenous catecholamine concentration high ventricular fibrillation even absence epinephrine administration . Currently , epinephrine vasopressor choice treatment cardiac arrest although vasopressin use alternative . Of note , vasopressin show superior epinephrine patient asystole however , effect similar epinephrine management VF pulseless electrical activity . Furthermore , previous study raise concern epinephrine 's beta adrenergic effect may increase myocardial oxygen consumption fibrillate heart predispose post-defibrillation dysfunction cardiac arrhythmia . Numerous animal study show beta adrenergic blockade reduce myocardial injury improve survival . Kudenchuk , et al undertook study patient hospital cardiac arrest due ventricular fibrillation . Patients randomize receive either amiodarone placebo three consecutive defibrillation one dose epinephrine . The author conclude patient receive amiodarone high rate survival hospital admission . It felt beneficial effect relate initial class II beta block property amiodarone . Furthermore , Dorian , et al report high rate survival hospital admission patient receive amiodarone compare lidocaine shock resistant out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation . Analysis European Myocardial Infarct Amiodarone Trial Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Trial reveal interaction beta-blockers amiodarone , specifically , combination group well survival interaction statistically significant arrhythmic death resuscitate arrest .</detailed_description>
