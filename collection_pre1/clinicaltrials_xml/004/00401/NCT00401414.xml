	<brief_title>Study Develop Reliable Nomogram That Incorporates Clinical Genetic Information</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 3-phase plan ultimately test whether rapid turnaround genetic test improve safety efficacy warfarin anticoagulation warfarin naïve patient newly induce maintain warfarin . Each phase address specific progressively ambitious question . Phase 1 500-patient cohort study determine whether develop reliable nomogram incorporate clinical genetic information maintain patient within target therapeutic range often 70 % time , conventional historical benchmark excellence warfarin dose . BACKGROUND : Warfarin patent 1948 introduce commercially 1954 . In 2004 , 24 million prescription write warfarin United States alone . Warfarin constitute 20th frequently prescribe drug United States . This remarkable , drug life cycle long warfarin , even few claim increase use 50 year follow introduction . Warfarin Vitamin K antagonist . Gamma-carboxylation vitamin K crucial coagulation factor II , VII , IX , X function properly , well antithrombotic endogenous Protein C Protein S. Gamma-carboxylation vitamin K allow clot protein bind calcium phospholipid surface upon coagulation occurs . Warfarin vitamin K antagonists interfere vitamin K cause liver synthesize nonfunctional coagulation factor . Warfarin almost completely absorbed gastrointestinal mucosa . It metabolize liver Cytochrome P450 system . The kidney eliminate largely inactive metabolite . Warfarin anticoagulation prescribe prevent stroke venous thromboembolism . Optimal dose require achieve maintain target range International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) . The INR prothrombin time standardize accord type thromboplastin reagent use coagulation laboratory . Each thromboplastin reagent designate International Sensitivity Index . The formula use calculate INR show : The target INR indication , include atrial fibrillation , DVT , pulmonary embolism , usually 2.0 3.0 . Excessive dose characterize elevated INR precipitate hemorrhage , include stroke due intracranial bleeding . To minimize risk intracranial hemorrhage , important maintain maximum INR level 3.0 . When INR exceed 3.0 , risk intracranial bleeding increase exponentially . Inadequate dosing , associate subtherapeutic INR , predispose stroke due thromboembolism DVT pulmonary embolism . For example , prevent thrombotic stroke patient atrial fibrillation , important maintain INR least 2.0 . The vulnerable period thrombosis hemorrhage due warfarin initiation phase anticoagulation , optimal dose least certain . Adverse event rate high vulnerable period , generally consider persist least 3 month . Patients previously expose warfarin vulnerable individual history guide clinician optimal initiation dose particular patient . Dosing nomograms work poorly . Trial error predominate method dose warfarin . Warfarin virtually contemporary drug prescribe use trial error methodology . Various warfarin initiation regimen attempt , none common use . In 1984 , Fennerty propose every 16-hour dose initiation nomogram patient venous thromboembolism whose average age 52 year . This nomogram never gain wide support awkward dose interval use patient population much young average population patient take warfarin . In 1998 , `` modify Fennerty '' nomogram introduce dosed patient warfarin every 24 hour . The nomogram enrol old population , average age 78 year . However , 35 % patient excessively high INRs exceed 4.0 within first 4 day warfarin initiation . Many clinical factor predispose excessively high INR : advanced age , abnormal liver function , decrease vitamin K intake poor nutrition poor appetite , diarrhea , antibiotic , certain concomitant medication , alcohol binge , perhaps change warfarin preparation ( substitute one generic preparation another interchange generic brand-name Coumadin® ) . The common reason abnormally low INRs intake high amount vitamin K green leafy vegetable , certain drug-warfarin interaction , failure take warfarin appropriately . ADVANCES IN GENETICS : Genotyping patient onset warfarin anticoagulation may allow precise dosing . This may translate few major bleed clot event well few out-of-target-range INRs , serve surrogate bleed clot complication . During first several week follow prescription warfarin , INR laboratory test obtain frequently , often twice weekly . Better predictive assessment optimal dose decrease laboratory cost improve convenience patient . Cytochrome P450 2C9 genotyping identify mutation associate impaired warfarin metabolism . The CYP2C9 genotype account 10 % warfarin dose variance . Vitamin K receptor polymorphism test identify whether patient require low , intermediate , high dos warfarin . Five common vitamin K receptor gene haplotype account additional 25 % warfarin dose variance . Until , major drawback apply screen CYP2C9 polymorphism warfarin dose VKORC1 genotyping slow turnaround time . However , HPCGG able Nomogram Development Trial offer turnaround within 24-48 hour . This rapid turnaround time allow initial immediate anticoagulation twice daily injectable agent several day . Therefore , prior initiation warfarin , sufficient time genetic information receive implemented clinical team . The human cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) superfamily comprise 57 gene . These gene code myriad enzymatic reaction . The cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 responsible metabolism S enantiomer warfarin . Two allelic variant , CYP2C9*2 CYP2C9*3 , differ wild type CYP2C9*1 single amino acid substitution . The allelic variant associate impaired hydroxylation S-warfarin . A retrospective cohort study 200 patient receive warfarin dose anticoagulation clinic suggest CYP2C9*2 CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms associate increase risk excessive anticoagulation bleed event . At Brigham Women 's Hospital Anticoagulation Service , identify 73 patient CYP2C9 genotyping , assess PCR amplification restriction enzyme digestion analysis DNA isolate circulate leukocyte . The CYP2C9 polymorphism independently predict low warfarin requirement adjust body mass index , age , acetaminophen use , race . At least one polymorphism present every patient require 1.5 mg less daily warfarin . We find high rate excessive anticoagulation observe high bleeding rate patient polymorphisms . To date , one prospective study publish warfarin dose base upon cytochrome P450 2C9 genotyping . It negative study fail prove hypothesis genotyping would lead good control warfarin dose . 48 orthopedic surgery patient study genotyping screen nongenetic factor might affect warfarin dose bleeding risk . The warfarin dose algorithm base upon genetic screening lead achievement stable therapeutic INR wild type group CYP2C9 variant group similar time course . Nevertheless , despite pharmacogenetics-based dosing , patient variant high risk excessive anticoagulation , define INR great 4.0 . This fail study emphasize pivotal importance comprehensive nomogram development phase prior initiate randomize controlled trial . This trial also demonstrate need consider factor affect INR warfarin dose : advanced age , underlie comorbidities thrombotic disposition , abnormal liver function , inadequate excessive vitamin K intake , alter vitamin K metabolism ( e.g. , diarrhea antibiotic ) , alcohol drug-food interaction , change warfarin preparation ( switch among different generic switch brand name Coumadin® ) . The important lesson cohort study decrease clinical adverse event due warfarin , first necessary develop warfarin nomogram superior current practice educate guess trial error . Rieder colleague identify 10 non-coding single- nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 ( VKORC1 ) gene fall five major haplotype . Two haplotype , A B , use determine whether patient require low ( AA , 2.7 mg/day ) , intermediate ( AB , 4.9 mg/day ) , high ( BB , 6.2 mg/day ) dose drug . The haplotype differ accord racial distribution . These haplotype responsible 25 % variance dose . Therefore , combination cytochrome P450 VKORC1 genotyping facilitate optimal warfarin dosing . OBJECTIVE : Primary Objective : We develop nomogram warfarin dose us rapid turnaround genetic test monthly nomogram modification ( necessary ) achieve effective safe warfarin induction maintenance . More 70 % time , maintain warfarin naïve patient within target therapeutic range . The percent time therapeutic range analyze begin 2 week initiation warfarin . Analyses stratify indication anticoagulation . We obtain Informed Consent exploratory genetic testing sample DNA , addition cytochrome P450 2C9 VKORC1 allele . This flexible approach permit u add additional promising test emerge modify nomogram make even effective achieve target range INR . PLANS : Genetic Testing : 1 . Detect known allele cytochrome P450 Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 ( VKORC1 ) . 2 . Collect 5 ml blood EDTA ( lavender top ) tube . 3 . DNA process use ROCHE MagnaPure automate prep system . Patient Population : Warfarin naïve patient undergo initiation warfarin anticoagulation participate Partners anticoagulation clinic , include Brigham Women 's Hospital , Massachusetts General Hospital , North Shore Medical Center , Faulkner Hospital , Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital , Newton Wellesley Hospital . Overview Timeline : We enroll patient 9 month , follow patient 3 month twice weekly coagulation test prothrombin time standardize International Normalized Ratio , adjust monthly nomogram ( necessary ) improve fit emerge data cohort .</detailed_description>
