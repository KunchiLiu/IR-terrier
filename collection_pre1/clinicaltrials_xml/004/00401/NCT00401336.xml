	<detailed_description>Iron excess increasingly regarded important cofactor morbidity attribute many disorder . Assessment body iron store measurement serum ferritin concentration poor specificity reliable method histological biochemical assessment liver biopsy . Because liver biopsy invasive procedure , image method develop detect quantify hepatic iron content . The aim study use simplify magnetic resonance imaging technique quantify simultaneously iron fat content liver compare result quantification obtain biochemically . Patients need liver biopsy propose enrolled study . A magnetic resonance ( MR ) study perform use breath-hold gradient echo sequence single echo new multiple-echo gradient-echo sequence . Liver muscle MR signal quantitatively determine compare biochemical assessment liver iron concentration steatosis quantification .</detailed_description>
