	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate protective immunity human cholera Dhaka , Bangladesh . Immune responses Vibrio cholerae poorly understand extensively studied endemic setting Bangladesh . Understanding systemic mucosal immune response influence outcome infection V cholerae assist development effective cholera vaccine . Identifying host factor , human genetic variation nutritional status , affect outcome infection V cholerae lead improve understanding disease pathogenesis well treatment modality . One likely key determinant protection follow either natural cholera vaccination duration immune response key antigen , particularly mucosal surface . This study propose assess duration immune response group 75 cholera study participant course 1 year follow-up correlate baseline immune responses 250 household contact index patient , protection disease subsequent 30 day . The researcher assess duration immunity serum know cholera virulence factor , include serum vibriocidal antibody antibody specific LPS , cholera toxin , B subunit ( CtxB ) , TcpA . The researcher also measure antigen-specific memory B cell circulate human blood , previously use examine longevity B cell immunologic memory follow various infection vaccination . The objective study determine gene protein express V. cholerae human infection ; determine V. cholerae proteins immunogenic human cholera infection Bangladesh ; assess duration immune response V. cholerae antigens follow episode cholera ; determine anti-V. cholerae immune response protective exposure cholera household contact ; evaluate select host factor influence development immune response follow cholera , susceptibility symptomatic cholera follow exposure household contact . A total 325 study participant ( 75 index patient acute cholera 250 household contact ) enrol . Index study participant recruit among patient present acute cholera International Center Diarrheal Diseases Research , Bangladesh ( ICDDR , B ) hospital Dhaka , Bangladesh . Any individual acute cholera age 2 60 year , inclusive , without severe complicate illness , household contact cholera patient age 2 60 year , inclusive , eligible enrollment study . The length participation study participant 1 year acute cholera index patient 30 day household contact . For cholera patient , study physician perform initial assessment collect blood various time point 1 year . Study participant ( case household contact ) come ICDDR , B blood collection . On Study Days 3 6 8 10 , train field worker visit household contact collect information symptom treatment diarrhea obtain rectal swab sample . Household contact come ICDDR , B Days 2 3 , 7 ( range 6-9 ) questionnaire , rectal swab , blood drawing . Questionnaires fill upon enrollment study visit .</detailed_description>
