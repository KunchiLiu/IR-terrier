	<brief_summary>CIDEIM , Centro Internacional de Entrenamiento e Investigaciones Medicas , conduct research study disease Cutaneous Leishmaniasis , cause Leishmania parasite cause skin sore . Researchers hope find human body defend Leishmania . A total 472 individual , age 7 70 year , belong one follow group include study : recur disease , chronic disease , disease sign symptom ( asymptomatic ) , healthy individual . Study procedure include questionnaire buccal swab ( swab inside cheek cotton wooden applicator ) . In addition , asymptomatic healthy individual provide blood sample . Study participation 1.5 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expression Mif Alleles Individuals With Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study define proportion low high expression Mif alleles individual recurrent chronic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis compare individual asymptomatic infection healthy donor ( control ) , order determine allele associate outcome infection . This study part 2 project include DMID protocols 05-0139 06-0010 . Specific objective : determine proportion low expression ( 5-CATT ) Mif alleles individual recurrent chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis , healthy donor ( control ) , individual asymptomatic infection ; determine proportion high expression ( 6,7,8-CATT ) Mif alleles individual recurrent chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis , healthy donor ( control ) , individual asymptomatic infection ; determine Mif Genotype repertoire frequency distribution endemic population study . This study conduct 472 participant enrol one follow 4 group : recurrent disease , chronic disease , asymptomatic infection , healthy donor ( control ) . Patients ( male female ) age 7-70 year chronic recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis ( historic active ) diagnose either Cali ( CIDEIM ) Tumaco ( San Andr√©s Hospital ) Colombian Pacific Coast invite participate study . Asymptomatic healthy donor ( control ) also enrol . Pregnant woman enrol . Consent sample obtain single study visit 1.5 hour . No follow-up visit plan study . Genetic material extract amplified buccal swab use determine proportion low high expression Mif alleles group . Expression recurrent chronic participant compare asymptomatic participant healthy donor ( control ) order determine expression frequency relate outcome infection . Blood sample obtain asymptomatic healthy donor undergo vitro blastogenesis test confirm asymptomatic/healthy donor status . Study outcome measure : frequency low expression ( 5-CATT ) Mif alleles participant recurrent chronic disease , individual asymptomatic infection healthy donor ( control ) ; frequency high expression ( 6,7,8-CATT ) Mif alleles participant recurrent chronic disease individual asymptomatic infection healthy donor ( control ) ; Mif Genotype repertoire frequency distribution endemic population study site .</detailed_description>
