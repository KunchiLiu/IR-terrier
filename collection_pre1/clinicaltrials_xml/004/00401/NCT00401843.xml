	<brief_summary>The purpose Part 1 study determine safety combination Siltuximab ( CNTO 328 ) bortezomib ( Velcade ) . The purpose Part 2 study compare length progression free survival patient give CNTO 328 bortezomib patient give bortezomib alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy CNTO 328 Bortezomib Bortezomib Alone Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study see effect CNTO 328 relapse refractory multiple myeloma . The study drug , CNTO 328 , chimeric ( part mouse ) antibody ( small protein important fight infection ) .CNTO 328 block small protein call Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) . IL-6 make naturally body , normal level important inflammatory response . High level IL-6 help cancer cell grow interfere chemotherapy drug kill cancer cell . Cancer-related sickness cachexia ( weight loss ) , bone resorption ( weaken bone ) , depression link high level IL-6 . CNTO 328 show slow tumor growth shrink tumor test animal . In clinical trial , 100 patient receive CNTO 328 . There study ongoing participant kidney cancer , hematologic malignancy ( blood cancer multiple myeloma ) , prostate cancer , see CNTO 328 safe see effect type cancer . At time , unknown effect CNTO 328 participant ' cancer . Bortezomib type drug know `` proteasome inhibitor . '' A proteasome substance find every cell help break substance ( 'proteins ' ) role way cell divide . If proteasome inhibit , perform function cell , cell divide die . Over 8000 patient multiple myeloma type cancer treat bortezomib . Bortezomib extensively study patient previously treat multiple myeloma . Based establish activity pretreated multiple myeloma , bortezomib register United States Europe treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least two prior therapy demonstrate disease progression last therapy . Bortezomib currently also study several cancer types.This study consist two part . The purpose Part 1 determine safety CNTO 328 bortezomib give together treatment . The purpose Part 2 compare safety effect ( good bad ) combination CNTO 328 bortezomib safety effect bortezomib alone . About 20 patient take part first part study . About 270 patient take part second part study approximately 70 site US , Canada , Europe . Patients study 12 month , follow-up period around 9 month . The study divide four different phase : Screening phase-which last 4 week . During phase study doctor perform test see patient participate study.Treatment phase-which may last 4 cycle 42 day patient treat CNTO 328 bortezomib . Maintenance phase-If patient benefit therapy treatment phase , patient continue receive CNTO 328 bortezomib , cycle 35 day . Follow phase , include end treatment visit 4 week patient 's last infusion follow visit every three month patient start new anti-cancer treatment . CNTO 328 6mg/kg ( 6 milligram per kilogram body weight ) give intravenously ( vein ) 2 hour every 2 week . Patients respond stable disease well may receive additional dos . Bortezomib give IV ( vein ) 1.3 mg/m2 3-5 second twice week 2 week follow 1 week rest .</detailed_description>
