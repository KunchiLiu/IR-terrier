	<brief_title>The Effect PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Postoperative Vigor Handgrip Strength ( VIGOR Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total joint arthroplasty ( include hip knee surgery ) often lead significant blood loss may result need blood transfusion . To prepare possibility , patient frequently donate blood advance surgery available transfusion require procedure . This process self-donation know preoperative autologous blood donation ( PAD ) . PAD associate certain limitation include example , worsen pre-operative anemia ( potentially lead need transfusion ) questionable cost-effectiveness . PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) hormone stimulates red blood cell production . Administration PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) also use presurgically anemic patient undergo elective noncardiac , nonvascular surgery increase hemoglobin level ( red blood cell ) reduce need transfusion surgery . PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) show specifically increase hemoglobin level reduce need blood transfusion patient undergo hip knee surgery . However , study do evaluate ability epoetin alfa enhance energy quality-of-life patient hip knee surgery . This study undertaken compare two method blood management ( Epoetin alfa treatment versus PAD ) term vigor score ( functional activity well-being ) . Other outcome study include handgrip strength , post-operative hemoglobin level , number patient require transfusion . This randomized ( patient assign treatment group chance ) , open-label ( patient physician know treatment group patient assign ) trial . Patients randomly assign treatment PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) receive subcutaneous injection 600 IU/kg weekly 3 week preoperatively within 24 hour postoperatively . Patients PAD group donate 1 unit blood total knee arthroplasty , 2 unit blood total hip arthroplasty , tolerate , begin 28 day surgery . Patients permit receive study treatment . Daily oral iron supplementation give treatment group . It recommend blood transfusion give patient hemoglobin great equal 8 g/dL unless clinical symptom patient history warrant intervention . Investigators instruct use identical criterion autologous allogeneic blood transfusion . Baseline measurement include hemoglobin , hematocrit , red blood cell count , white blood cell count , reticulocytes , vigor , handgrip strength collect 28 21 day surgery . Hemoglobin , vigor , handgrip strength repeat within 24 hour surgery Day 2 , Day 4 5 ( discharge ) , day 14 21 surgery . Safety assess throughout study monitoring occurrence severity adverse event include infection thromboembolism . Patients assign epoetin alfa group receive 600 IU/kg PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) administer subcutaneously ( skin ) weekly 3 week preoperatively 24 hour surgery .</detailed_description>
