	<brief_title>A Study CNTO 328 Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 open-label , multicenter , nonrandomized study safety pharmacokinetics combination CNTO 328 docetaxel patient metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer ( HRPC ) . Eligible patient must age &gt; = 18 year , histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate , document metastatic disease . Prior chemotherapy metastatic disease allowed.The study last approximately 26 month . This study conduct 4 phase : 1 . Screening ( 4 week ) : understanding signing informed consent form , physical/neurological exam , ECG , vitals check , urinalysis , radiologic assessment , routine blood sample , study blood sample , circulate tumor cell blood sample , testosterone level blood sample , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) sample . If result show patient part study , patient begin run-in phase . If result screen show patient part study , patient receive docetaxel part study CNTO 328.Starting first docetaxel infusion , patient require take prednisone twice day , end Cycle 3 . After Cycle 3 , study doctor decide and/or prednisone take . Dexamethasone require 12 hour , 3 hour , 1 hour start every docetaxel infusion Cycle 3 . After Cycle 3 , study doctor decide dexamethasone take . Antiemetics ( prevent nausea vomit ) also require . The study doctor decide dose , often , take 2 . Run-in Phase ( 3 week ) : The term run-in phase describes period time start formal study treatment . During phase , patient receive one drug , either docetaxel CNTO 328 depend assign group . Groups 1A , 2 , 3 : The patient give docetaxel 3 week formal study treatment begin . During next 2 week patient receive study drug , undergo certain test procedure . Group 1B : The patient give CNTO 328 infusion 2 week formal study treatment begin . During next week patient receive study drug , certain test procedure . 3 . Cycles 1 17 ( 14 cycle - 46 week additional 3 cycle -up 55 week ) : Cycles 1 17 plan 3 week length . All treatment group receive infusion docetaxel week 1 every cycle . The CNTO 328 infusion occurs base treatment group patient assign . Group 1A : Patients receive 6mg/kg infusion CNTO 328 every two week , start week 1 , cycle 1 . Group 1B : Patients receive 6mg/kg infusion CNTO 328 every two week , start two week prior cycle 1.Group 2 : Patients receive 9 mg/kg infusion CNTO 328 every three week , start week 1 , cycle 1 . Group 3 : Patients receive 12mg/kg infusion CNTO 328 every three week , start week 1 , cycle 1 . The overall amount CNTO 328 increase high group . Therefore , Group 1A 1B fill Group 2 , Group 2 fill Group 3 . This allow CNTO 328 test safe manner . The docetaxel dose remain three groups.Patients may receive 14 cycle treatment provide evidence disease progression , include serum PSA progression , unacceptable toxicity . However , patient respond treatment least stable disease ( SD ) 14 cycle permit receive 3 additional cycle treatment . In addition drug therapy , patient receive test procedure . Most test require study medication administer throughout study would do normally treatment prostate cancer . However , test procedure may do often . The following test procedure : Routine blood test ; Study blood sample ; Testosterone level sample ; PSA sample ; Circulating Tumor Cell blood sample ; Urinalysis ; Physical exam/neurological exam ; Vital sign ; ECG ( electrocardiogram ) ; Radiological tests4 . Follow-up : After patient complete treatment follow-up visit include patient discontinue treatment early . The patient 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 week final treatment cycle complete . The Week 4 visit `` End Study Visit '' . There 3 visit 12 , 18 , 24 week final treatment cycle . Long-term Follow-up : No matter patient leave study , study doctor nurse may telephone ask health and/or look medical record every 3 month check . They one year last infusion study drug . Patients need go study center test perform . The study center also ask treatment patient receive complete participation study . Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 give intravenously ( vein ) every 3 wks 17 three week cycle . CNTO328 administer intravenously ( vein ) 2 hour accord one follow regimen : 6 milligram medication per kilogram body weight ( mg/kg ) every 2 wks ; 9 mg/kg every 3 wks ; 12 mg/kg every 3 wks 17 three week cycle .</detailed_description>
