	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine body defend Leishmania ( Viannia ) , parasite cause skin infection skin sore . Certain cell immune system act aggressively Leishmania people mild Leishmania symptom long-term recur symptoms disease . Participants study include people currently Leishmania infection , people infection past , people never expose parasite . This study enroll 220 adult , age 18 70 year , 3 site Colombia . Blood sample collect volunteer least study . Participants also undergo HIV test . Volunteers participate 2 study visit , schedule 2-3 week apart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Relating Distinct Vitro Susceptibility Human Macrophages L. Viannia Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study aim determine mechanisms lead distinct vitro susceptibility human macrophages L. Viannia infection , relationship clinical phenotype . It third part study include DMID protocols 06-0009 06-0010 . The general objective study determine mechanism lead distinct vitro susceptibility human macrophages L. Viannia infection , relationship clinical phenotype . ( Understanding immune mechanism underlie disease provide insight development new method treatment intervention . ) The specific objective study : determine association Toll response profile monocyte macrophages vitro susceptibility phenotype , analyze Toll receptor response relation vitro clinical phenotype participant present asymptomatic , chronic recurrent disease healthy donor ( control ) ( Toll receptor ) ; determine gene expression response susceptible resistant macrophage exposure infection L. panamensis , order identify gene gene product determine course infection host cell link clinical response ; define interaction cytokine Leishmania infection promote latent persistence infection activation growth , explore role apoptosis elimination propagation infection ( Apoptosis ) ; determine functional phenotypic characteristic susceptible resistant macrophage healthy donor clinically disparate individual flow cytometric analysis ( Functional Phenotype mononuclear phagocyte ) . Participants four specific objective ask provide relevant demographic , clinical epidemiologic information blood sample . Monocytes macrophage differentiate peripheral blood sample analyze different methodology ( flow cytometry , Real time PCR , ELISA microarray analysis ) , result compare across group order determine macrophage response infection determinant recurrent and/or chronic disease development . Participants enrol three site Colombia : CIDEIM , Cali ; CIDEIM , San Andr√©s Hospital , Tumaco ; San Juan Bautista Hospital , Chaparral . Patients ( male female ) age 18-70 year historic chronic recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis diagnose three study site invite participate study . Asymptomatic healthy donor ( control ) also enrol . A maximum 220 participant enrol . For historic ( chronic recurrent ) asymptomatic participant , single study visit plan . For healthy donor , 2 study visit plan . The second visit program 2-3 week first visit . Study outcome measure level transcription cytokine ( e.g . TNF-alpha , IL-10 , IL-12 ) nuclear transcription factor normalize number macrophage ; percentage non-infected infected macrophages/monocytes express specific cytokine receptor Toll like receptor ; density receptor expression ; percentage apoptotic cell ; number change number parasites apoptotic non-apoptotic cell ; nitric oxide level ; cytokine production concentration supernatant macrophage culture ( e.g . TNF-alpha , IL-10 , IL-12 ) ; intracellular cytokine production , intracellular nitric oxide level ; percentage infect macrophages/monocytes number intracellular parasite time assess survival replication ; percentage non-infected infected macrophages/monocytes express specific activation differentiation marker intensity marker expression .</detailed_description>
