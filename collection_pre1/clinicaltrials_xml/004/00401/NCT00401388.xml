	<brief_summary>This phase II study perifosine patient chondrosarcomas , alveolar soft part sarcomas extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma . Patients receive perifosine 100 mg orally qhs food disease progression . The goal study include : - In study daily dose perifosine previously determine relatively non-toxic evaluated patient chondrosarcomas , alveolar soft part sarcomas extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma . - Response therapy base regression measurable disease accord Choi criterion . Time progression duration stable disease measure secondary endpoint study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase II study perifosine patient chondrosarcomas , alveolar soft part sarcomas extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma . Patients receive perifosine 100 mg orally qhs food disease progression . Perifosine available 50 mg tablet . Patients take two perifosine 50 mg tablet orally day bedtime food . Administering drug qhs show decrease gastrointestinal toxicity patient . Patients may need anti-emetics and/or anti-diarrheals . All patient may continue therapy unless disease progression document two occasion least 4 week apart . Patients experience toxicity may continue treatment dos delay reduce . Evaluation lesion progression response make 3-month interval . STUDY KEY POINTS - Treatment administered outpatient basis 28-day cycle . - Growth factor need , however , use patient trial NOT prohibit . - A favorable outcome define complete partial response accord Choi criterion stable disease Choi criteria 6 month longer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis chondrosarcoma , extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma alveolar soft part sarcoma . Patients may prior chemotherapy , patient three form prior chemotherapy metastasis , patient 's clinical course discuss study chairman patient enrol study Patients must progression disease Choi criterion . ECOG performance status 01 . Patients ECOG PS 2 may admit approval study chairman . At least 13 year age . Patients must measurable disease . Patients brain metastasis progress least 2 month follow surgery radiotherapy consider discussion study chairman . Patients must life expectancy 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function , unless opinion treat investigator , abnormality related tumor , study chairman agree abnormality unlikely affect safety perifosine use .

Patients must able ingest oral medication obtain gastrostomy tube . Female patient pregnant lactate ineligible . All female childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 72 hour treatment . Men woman childbearing potential must agree employ adequate contraception prevent pregnancy therapy four week completion treatment . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients receive investigational commercial agent therapy administer intent treat patient 's malignancy , except bisphosphonates . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition perifosine ( miltefosine edelfosine ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness—including , limited , ongoing active infection—and psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients history unstable newly diagnose angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction ( within 6 month enrollment ) New York Heart Assoc . class IIIV congestive heart failure .</criteria>
