	<brief_summary>The primary aim protocol investigate possible new , neuroprotective treatment prevent cognitive deficit occur carotid endarterectomy . We investigate whether widely use antibiotic agent - minocycline - show neuroprotective effect animal model neurological disease - reduce cognitive deficit associate surgical procedure carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) . Because cognitive deficit believe result small stroke ( due emboli and/or hypoperfusion ) , study provide preliminary data use drug neuroprotective agent stroke - lead cause disability . ( 1 ) The first aim study examine whether 5 dos minocycline administer 36 hrs 1 dose 12 hrs surgical procedure patient undergo CEA effective reduce cognitive deficit associate procedure compare placebo . . The null hypothesis difference cognitive performance change CEA patient receive placebo minocycline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effects Minocycline Cognitive Function After Carotid Endarterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol phase IIa study prospectively investigate whether minocycline ( antibiotic show neuroprotective effect animal model ) decrease cognitive deficit associate carotid endarterectomy . This trial randomize , parallel-group design , double-blind , placebo control clinical trial conduct Brigham Women 's Hospital . The principal aim investigation study effect minocycline cognitive performance carotid endarterectomy . To measure cognitive function , perform neuropsychological battery test ( detail ) . This battery test carry blinded rater ( neurologist ) perform accord follow timetable : Training session : baseline , patient perform task several time reach stable plateau ( define variation less 10 % last three trial ) order eliminate confound effect learning . Baseline evaluation : baseline evaluation perform day prior surgery . Post-treatment evaluation : post-treatment evaluation perform 24 hour surgical procedure blind rater . Neuropsychological battery test : base neuropsychological battery test similar study evaluate cognitive deficit associate CEA consist follow test : 1 . Trail make test - part A B ( test evaluate visual concept visuo-motor track ) 2 . Controlled Oral Word Association ( letter C , F L ) ( test evaluate verbal fluency ) 3 . The Boston Naming Test ( name 60 picture ) ( test evaluate leave hemisphere damage ) 4 . Digit Span Forward Backward ( test evaluate work memory ) 5 . Stroop Task ( test evaluate selective attention mental flexibility ) 6 . Mini-mental state examination ( test evaluate adult patient 's level global cognitive functioning ) Blood sample analysis : As secondary outcome , analyze subject blood sample respect two particular substance : S100B neuron specific enolase . The rationale perform proteomic study past research show subtle cerebral injury carotid endarterectomy , even absence stroke , might associate significant increase serum S100B ( Connolly , 2001 - Neurosurgery , 2001 49 ( 5 ) ) also traumatic brain injury ( Cotena , 2006 , J Neurosurg 2006 104 ( 6 ) ) . In addition , neuron specific enolase ( NSE ) also seem valuable predict brain damage patient brain traumatic injury ( Naeimi , 2006 - Brain Inj 2006 20 ( 5 ) ) , thus show two substance might important biomarkers investigate study . After eligibility screening ( inclusion exclusion criterion ) , consent form , medical history physical exam participant randomize exposure - minocycline placebo . The pill ( minocycline placebo ) appearance one person know whether treatment active placebo . Randomization : Because sample size relatively small , participant randomize minocycline placebo randomization stratification approach . This approach ensure group similar distribution regard baseline performance cognitive test . Participants gather group ( stratum ) define performance neuropsychological task ( baseline ) . Participants within stratum randomize one two treatment group - minocycline placebo - accord block randomization four use randomization list generate computer take account study entrance order . These group define follow : Minocycline : use dosage minocycline currently use clinical indication also use trial employ drug anti-inflammatory agent . Minocycline administer period 36 hr surgery ( 100 mg twice day 200 mg morning surgery - total 5 dos ) 12 hr surgery ( single dose 100 mg ) . The two dos minocycline administer morning surgery take small sip water . Placebo : placebo pill appearance real drug ( minocycline ) administer use timetable active drug .</detailed_description>
