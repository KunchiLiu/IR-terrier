	<brief_summary>This Phase 1b pre-operative lung cancer trial wherein patient operable lung cancer treat RAD001 evaluate target effect compound relevant molecular pathway 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) uptake tumor positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan baseline immediately prior surgery . The safety profile RAD001 also evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b pre-operative lung cancer trial wherein patient operable lung cancer treat RAD001 3-4 week study effect novel agent relevant molecular pathway . The study also assess FDG uptake tumor baseline upon completion therapy ( surgery ) PET scan . The safety profile RAD001 also evaluate . New agent regimens urgently need lung cancer treatment . With development novel agent small molecule design curtail aggressive aspect disease , progress realize . However , much effort insight require real gain make . We propose study mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) axis , know abnormal non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , translate knowledge therapeutic adjustment lead meaningful advance lung cancer treatment . Approximately 35 patient participate Winship Cancer Institute Emory University Atlanta , Georgia .</detailed_description>
