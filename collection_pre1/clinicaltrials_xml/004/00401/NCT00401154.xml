	<brief_summary>The study effect exercise program use stationary bicycling child spastic diplegic form cerebral palsy . Spastic diplegia type cerebral palsy involve spasticity `` tightness '' leg muscle . We hope learn whether type exercise allow child develop improved strength muscle bend straighten knee , enhance level physical fitness , improve ability walk improve ability perform activity important . We hypothesize child participate stationary cycling intervention gain strength muscle bend straighten knee , able complete 600 yard walk run test ( test endurance ) rapidly , improve score test function call Gross Motor Function Measure ( test design specifically child cerebral palsy ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>age 7 16 year engage regular education primary academic path ( child receive resource help exclude ) ; ability follow simple verbal direction ; good fair selective motor control least one limb ; ability walk independently , without assistive device , short distance . The low level walk ability inclusion independent walk indoors limitation outdoors community , require use wheelchair setting . These criterion walk ability place subject Levels IIII Gross Motor Functional Classification System ( GMFCS ) ( Palisano et al. , 1997 ) . musculoskeletal neurosurgical surgery baclofen pump implantation within past year ; botulinum toxin injection within past 6 month ; serial cast new orthotics within past 3 month ; initiate increase oral medication affect neuromuscular system , e.g . baclofen , within past 3 month ; onset physical therapy , exercise , sport activity , change assistive device walk within past 3 month ; inability unwillingness maintain age appropriate behavior ; serious medical condition cardiac disease , diabetes , asthma , uncontrolled seizure ; current participation fitness program , include cardiorespiratory endurance exercise , least one time per week ; significant hip joint contracture hip passively move throughout excursion 30 80 degree ; significant knee joint contracture knee passively move throughout excursion 40 110 degree ; significant ankle joint contracture ankle passively move throughout excursion 10 20 degree plantarflexion . Exclusion criteria 8 10 base passive joint excursion necessary perform stationary cycling ( Ericson et al. , 1988 ) allow hip knee joint compensation subject without ankle dorsiflexion range motion .</criteria>
