	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine type cell participate defense human Leishmania ( skin parasite ) . People 18-70 year age leishmaniasis , heal leishmanial lesion , healthy invite participate study . Approximately 150 people participate study . Participants ask provide general information skin sore , . A skin test perform blood sample obtain . This study involve 3 visit ; first visit last 5 hour second visit last 30 minute . The third visit may schedule within 3 day second visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Th1/Th2 Polarization Linkage L. Viannia Infection Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine Th1/Th2 polarization occur link outcome infection L. Viannia ( asymptomatic , chronic recurrent infection ) . This protocol first part series study include protocols 05-0139 06-0009 . Specific objective include : defining expression human inflammatory cytokine ex vivo recall response live Leishmania PBMCs individual present different clinical phenotype transcriptional , translational secretion level ; assess situ circulate cell population active , chronic recurrent patient respect differentiation , activation , co-activation marker . Patients ( male female ) age 18-70 year , cutaneous leishmaniasis diagnose either Cali ( CIDEIM ) and/or Tumaco ( San Andr√©s Hospital ) Colombian Pacific Coast , and/or Chaparral , Tolima ( San Juan Bautista Hospital ) invite participate study . Both historic ( specific objective 1 ) active ( specific objective 2 ) patient enrol . Asymptomatic individual healthy donor ( control ) also invite participate . Pregnant breastfeed woman enrol . A total 150 participant enrol . For specific objective 1 , participant ask provide relevant demographic , clinical epidemiologic information record form design purpose . They also provide blood sample analyze determine compare expression human inflammatory cytokine ex vivo recall response live Leishmania PBMCs four group . Specific objective 2 develop CIDEIM-Cali , . Participants ask provide skin biopsy addition blood sample relevant information . They also undergo skin blister procedure . Samples analyze characterize compare situ circulate cell population group . Up three visit plan objective . The first visit duration 5 hour second one duration 30 minute . A third visit may program 48h-72h second visit participant undergo biopsy/skin blister procedure order evaluate possible bacterial superinfection prevent complication . This visit duration 20 minute . All visit take place period 4-5 day . In order define expression human inflammatory cytokine ex vivo recall response live Leishmania PBMCs individual present different clinical phenotype transcriptional , translational secretion level , follow variable measure compare among different group : level expression transcription factor cell stimulate live Leishmania ; cytokine concentration transcriptional , secretion level cell stimulate live Leishmania ; percentage specific PBMCs produce intracellular cytokine translational level . In order ass situ ( biopsy blister ) circulate cell population active , chronic recurrent patient respect differentiation , activation , co-activation marker , follow variable measure compare among different group : percentage infiltrate leukocyte blister fluid biopsy , circulate leukocyte blood , express specific differentiation , activation co-stimulation marker ; mean fluorescence intensity cell blood , blister fluid , biopsy express specific differentiation , activation co-stimulation marker ; percentage specific cell blister fluid , biopsy blood produce intracellular cytokine IFN-gamma , IL-10 , IL-4 IL-13 ; cytokine concentration blister fluid .</detailed_description>
