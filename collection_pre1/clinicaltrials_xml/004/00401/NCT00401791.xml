	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle mitochondrial defect sine qua non insulin resistance patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , obese subject family history T2DM ( FH+ ) . Exercise increase mitochondrial capacity whereas lipid infusion high fat diet decrease gene involve mitochondrial biogenesis . In study 2 cohort involve : Cohort I ( athlete , T2DM obese ) Cohort II ( healthy `` FH+ '' without `` FH- '' family history T2DM ) . This randomize , parallel arm clinical trial consist 4 period : screening , stabilization ( 3 day ) , baseline ( Cohort I II ) exercise period ( 14 day , Cohort II ) . The overall objective study validate paradigm evaluation compound drug activate mitochondrial biogenesis skeletal muscle . In Specific Aim 1 compare contrast biopsy MRS power detect difference mitochondrial capacity 78 subject : athlete ( N=10 ) , FH- ( N=24 ) , FH+ ( N=24 ) , obese ( N=10 ) T2DM ( N=10 ) . In Specific Aim 2 compare mitochondrial change response exercise subject FH - vs. FH + subject . In Specific Aim 3 determine HFD impair mitochondrial change response exercise FH+ subject . In Specific Aim 4 determine role mitochondrial capacity metabolic flexibility insulin sensitivity T2DM , obese , FH+ , FH- athlete subject .</detailed_description>
