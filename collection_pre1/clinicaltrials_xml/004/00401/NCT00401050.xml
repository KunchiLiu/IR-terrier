	<brief_title>Comparison Study Two Chiropractic Treatment Protocols Knee Pain Due Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise standard care PFPS give limited pain reduction functional improvement . Previous manipulative therapy PFPS ( without exercise ) limit patellofemoral joint alone . However , literature suggest additional manipulative therapy exercise soft-tissue treatment may give good outcome . Further research need . Therefore , project pilot study inform future randomize control trial determine chiropractic adjust full low extremity ( lumbosacral foot ) combine exercise soft tissue treatment ( Protocol group A ) superior chiropractic adjusting knee ( alone ) combine exercise soft tissue treatment ( Protocol group B ) treatment patellofemoral pain syndrome . We use Anterior Knee Pain Scale ( AKPS ) Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) valid reliable primary outcome measure , functional measure ( step-ups , step-downs squat ) Patient Satisfaction Scale ( PSS - discharge refer ) secondary outcome measure . This study help establish feasibility conduct quality research Cleveland Chiropractic College Los Angeles . In pilot study two group 10 subject 1 . Group A receive CMT knee , exercise soft tissue treatment ( Graston Instrument Soft Tissue Mobilization hereafter GISTM ) 2 . Group B receive CMT lumbosacral , sacroiliac ( ) low extremity joint , exercise soft tissue treatment ( GISTM ) . Enrolled subject receive total 6 treatment . The primary endpoint 2 month follow-up 6th treatment .</detailed_description>
