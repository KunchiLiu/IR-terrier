	<brief_summary>The aim study determine therapy aldosterone antagonist , Eplerenone , associate improved remodeling leave ventricle patient cardiomyopathy . We determine benefit cardiac remodeling associate improved clinical outcome , include improve exercise capacity reduce incidence major adverse cardiac event death , hospitalization heart-failure , serious heart rhythm disturbance transplantation . The null hypothesis therapy Eplerenone 12 month associate improvement cardiopulmonary exercise capacity furthermore treatment associate improved clinical outcome . In order test hypothesis study stable patient optimal drug therapy document cardiomyopathy use trial design therapy randomize , double-blinded placebo-controlled . This reduce likelihood 'researcher bias ' . Patients recruit Heart-failure Service Royal Brompton Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CMR Assess Fibrosis Cardiomyopathy Using Eplerenone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our aim recruit 140 patient ( base statistical power calculation ) . These patient recruit cardiology clinic The Royal Brompton Hospital well database patient previously undergone imaging . The study double-blinded , placebo-controlled randomize study . The recruited patient would establish diagnosis cardiomyopathy document history , examination characteristic echocardiographic + ECG finding . The patient would also CMR scan demonstrate late gadolinium hyperenhancement previously . These patient establish maximally tolerate dos standard drug use treatment cardiomyopathy ( include ACE inhibitor beta blocker appropriate ) dose drug would remain unchanged 2 month precede enrollment trial . Patients would randomize receive maximal dose 50mg eplerenone placebo . The study dose Eplerenone use initially 25mg daily ( one tablet ) . After 4 week , provide well tolerate problem dose increase usual maintenance dose 50mg daily ( two tablet ) . For patient receive placebo , number tablet receive match Eplerenone group time point . Baseline test include CMR evaluation ventricular function use magnetic field strength 1.5 Tesla ( T ) . The initial scan ass ventricular size function LV mass . Blood test take prior scan ( time intravenous cannulation ) urea electrolyte , liver function , cytokine , collagen marker . In addition , echocardiogram , 24 hour Holter monitor fit metabolic exercise test ( MVO2 ) perform part cardiac assessment baseline , 6 12 month . The finding initial scan test correlate base line parameter also prospectively compare occurrence event 6 12 month time period . During follow period event include death , cardiac arrest , cardiac transplantation , arrhythmic event , implantation implantable cardiac defibrillators/biventricular pacemaker , NYHA classification , escalation treatment hospitalization record . There regular clinical review 1 week , 2 week , 4 week 3 , 6 , 9 12 month study period point blood test take include check renal function look evidence hyperkalaemia renal failure may result treatment eplerenone . Other report adverse effect withdrawal trial direct result effect also record . After treatment/placebo stop contact patient within one week telephone ensure deterioration symptom review patient within four week post-treatment follow visit monitor blood-pressure , kidney function ensure evidence problem . Patients also ask complete Minnesota Living Heart Failure ( MLWHF ) Questionnaire baseline visit 6 12 month visit . It hop study reveal patient cardiomyopathy treat eplerenone evidence regression fibrosis concomitant improvement diastolic function demonstrate CMR scanning , well clinical outcome Holter metabolic exercise test marker collagen turnover .</detailed_description>
