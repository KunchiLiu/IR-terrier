Causes disruption glandular function pancreas , intestine , liver , lung ( cause chronic lung infection emphysema ) , sweat gland reproductive organ . We know many CF patient die lung failure , bring part repeat lung infection cause thick , sticky mucus readily clear lung . Inhaled mannitol osmotic agent investigate number small study examine mucociliary clearance , quality life lung function CF bronchiectasis . The promising result study warrant futher investigation . The aim study assess safety efficacy inhale mannitol administer twice day two week CF .</brief_summary>
