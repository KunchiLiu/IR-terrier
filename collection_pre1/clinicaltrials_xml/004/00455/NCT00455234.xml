	<brief_title>Rapid Tranquillization Trial : TREC-India II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : Consecutive adult psychiatric patient present department psychiatry outpatient , admit , violent , aggressive agitate behavior . Inclusion criteria 1 . The attend physician feel intramuscular sedation clearly indicated agitation , aggression violent behaviour , 2 . The physician feel either one intervention pose additional risk patient . 3 . The patient responsible relative provide informed consent participate trial . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Patients lack capacity give inform consent relative obtain consent exclude study protocol . 2 . The physician feel either one intervention pose risk patient . Ethical consideration Good evidence treatment acutely disturbed patient miss perceive difficulty perform trial non­consenting patient . However , close read recent draft Helsinki declaration reveals trial non­consenting patient permit 2 condition : ( 1 ) context exist answer question , ( 2 ) trial participant get clear therapeutic benefit whichever arm randomize . So placebos used study . The present trial proposes study efficacy two intervention reportedly effective safe management acute violence , whose relative merit unclear , shall enroll participant whose relative provide consent , unable , likely context . Randomisation allocation concealment Randomisation accordance computer generate list random number vary sized block less 10 prepared UK collaborator . This collaborator send randomisation code electronically investigator clinical responsibility trial , work pharmacist prepare sequentially numbered , seal , opaque , identical cardboard box either Haloperidol 5 mg × 2 ampoule + promethazine 50 mg × 1 ampoule Olanzepine 10 mg × 1 vial + water injection , accord randomisation sequence , plus disposable syringe needle study form . The outside box form participant ’ ID , score Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale ( Guy , 1976 ) , clinical diagnosis record whilst blind content box . Procedure : Once eligibility patient ensure , next consecutive box shall take emergency cupboard constitute randomization . The duty doctor shall record severity episode initial diagnosis form stick outside seal intervention pack . The box shall open intervention administer . The patient follow 15 , 30 , 60 120 min treatment team 240 min 2 week study coordinator . Data also obtain case note well interview relative treatment team . Blinding : The study blind point treatment assignment , minimize selection bias . After assignment , rating first 2 h blind management team need know prescribe medication . This pragmatic trial evaluate real-world intervention give blind . However , assessment point first two hour , 30 % rating additionally rat one investigator blind intervention . In addition , one investigator blind intervention give shall undertake rating 240 min . At time , also guess allocate intervention , assess blinding . Outcomes : Patients shall rat assessment point whether tranquil asleep ; addition , time onset tranquillization sleep note . Participants consider tranquil calm exhibit agitate , aggressive dangerous behavior others , property , . They consider asleep , inspection , appear sound asleep aroused ambient disturbance ; depth apparent slumber assess . They shall also rat Clinical Global Impression – Severity ( CGI–S ) scale entry , CGI–Improvement ( CGI–I ) scale ( Guy , 1976 ) respect aggression violence , Simpson–Angus extra pyramidal side-effects rating scale ( Simpson &amp; Angus , 1970 ) Barnes Akathisia Scale ( Barnes , 1989 ) assessment point ; clinically important adverse effect , especially dystonia , note . These assessment shall conduct participant awake , extra pyramidal symptom usually apparent sleep , case dystonia akathisia , likely prevent sleep . Other outcome within first 4 hour use additional medication control agitate aggressive behavior , use physical restraint , need medical attention number abscond . Participants shall also follow 2 week later check adverse effect . The primary outcome ‘ tranquil asleep 4 hour ’ . The inter-rater reliability investigator rating outcomes shall establish satisfactory commencement trial .</detailed_description>
