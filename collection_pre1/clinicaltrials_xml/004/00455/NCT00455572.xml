	<detailed_description>This open , four-arm , parallel-group study , conduct approximately 20 center Europe Canada . All patient receive immunotherapeutic treatment GSK1572932A , recruit four cohort accord detail disease . Cohort 1 : Patients resect stage IB , II IIIA tumor due standard chemotherapy cisplatin vinorelbine . These patient receive chemo-and immunotherapy parallel . Cohort 2 : Patients resect stage IB , II IIIA tumor due standard chemotherapy cisplatin vinorelbine . These patient first receive chemotherapy immunotherapy . Cohort 3 : Patients resect stage IB , II IIIA tumor due chemotherapy . These patient receive immunotherapy . Cohort 4 : Patients unresectable stage III tumor , follow standard chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . These patient receive immunotherapy . Immunotherapeutic treatment comprise eight dos GSK1572932A . Doses administered three-week interval ; Cohort 1 may adapt fit patient 's chemotherapy .
