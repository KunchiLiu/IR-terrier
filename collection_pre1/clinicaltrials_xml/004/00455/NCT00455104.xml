	<brief_summary>CFDI STUDY ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY ( ERT ) Fabry disease rare , inherit , genetic condition due deficiency enzyme call alpha-galactosidase A . This enzyme deficiency cause small blood vessel accumulate substance call glycolipid . Without sufficient level enzyme , alpha-galactosidase A , person Fabry Disease develop severe neuropathic pain , kidney disease , heart disease , stroke and/or premature death ; often age 60 . Fabry Disease estimate affect approximately one every 40,000 male twice many female Canada . We exact number person Canada disease . A common problem study rare condition difficulty identify majority people suffer disease . Gathering health information order well understand natural disease progression response treatment difficult . Until recently , treat symptom available people Fabry Disease . In 2001 , enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) develop treatment rare condition . ERT provide deficient enzyme may beneficial Fabry Disease . The Canadian Fabry Disease Initiative ( CFDI ) determine impact Enzyme Replacement Therapy ( ERT ) development complication Fabry Disease male females currently , receive ERT ; assess complication respond ERT therapy . Another purpose study establish national registry collect information person Fabry Disease Canada . Early ERT study involve human small number subject study short duration . The result clinical study lead approval therapy many country around world include Canada . To date though , evidence usefulness ERT direct impact natural course Fabry disease limit , cost continue high . As result issue , need continue long-term collection information relate effectiveness ERT well document true clinical outcome Canadian people Fabry disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CFDI STUDY ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY ( ERT ) : Canada-Wide Patient Recruitment There 600 people Canada know Fabry Disease . For detail Fabry Disease , please refer `` Brief Summary . '' The Canadian Fabry Disease Initiative collect information 3 different study group Fabry subject recruit across Canada 10-year period . The 6 goal nation-wide study follow : 1 . To establish national registry collect information relate identification monitoring person Fabry disease Canada ; 2 . To determine degree exist complication Fabry disease respond fail respond ERT ; 3 . To determine impact ERT development complication Fabry disease men woman ERT whose ERT interrupt ; 4 . To identify clinical problem best predict outcome ERT Fabry disease ; 5 . To compare relative effectiveness prevent complication Fabry disease agalsidase-alfa agalsidase-beta men woman ERT ; 6 . To identify possible side effect ERT . This 3-armed study consist 3 study population . The first group refer Cohort 1A . This group include male female Fabry Disease , currently ERT ERT treatment interrupt . We expect approximately 100 person Cohort 1A total . The second group , Cohort 1B , consist people never ERT , meet current Canadian guideline start ERT therapy . Approximately 200 subject recruit Canada . The third group call Natural History Cohort approximately 300 Canadian subject mild Fabry Disease currently need ERT . All number estimate exact number people Canada Fabry Disease unknown time . Data collect baseline every 6 12 month , follow : - Medical History - Physical examination - Neurological exam - Eye exam - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) - electrical trace one 's heart rhythm - Echocardiogram ( ultrasound heart ) - Holter monitor - Audiogram - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) CT Scan head - Pulmonary Function Test ( breathe test ) - Pain Questionnaire Quality Life Questionnaire - Lab test ( include alpha-galactosidase level ) - Review current medication - 24-hour urine collection random spot urine test To date though , evidence usefulness ERT direct impact natural course Fabry disease limit , cost continue high ( approximately $ 300,000 CDN per year per patient ) . As result issue , need continue long-term collection information relate effectiveness ERT well document true clinical outcome Canadian people Fabry disease .</detailed_description>
