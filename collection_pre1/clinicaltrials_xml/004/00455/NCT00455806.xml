Resistance fluoroquinolones low country , hence compound potential candidate second-line rescue treatment . The new fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin launch Bayer 1999 treatment respiratory tract infection , broad antibacterial spectrum comparable levofloxacin few phototoxic central nervous system excitatory effect . The possible role moxifloxacin H. pylorus eradication since clinical investigation</detailed_description>
