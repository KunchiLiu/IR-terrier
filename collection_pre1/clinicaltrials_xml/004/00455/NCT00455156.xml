	<detailed_description>There continue need develop additional long-term user control contraceptive ( 1 ) . Consistent need , contraceptive vaginal ring ( CVR ) deliver synthetic estrogen progestin hormone develop provide certain advantage available method hormonal contraception . Scientists Population Council ( PC ) perform preliminary 1-year study investigational CVR release effective dos synthetic estrogen progestin hormone . This CVR contain ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) , approve , market hormonal product Nestoroneâ ( NES ) , investigational , new chemical entity considerable clinical data NES formulation use transdermal system , implant CVRs . A potent 19-nor progesterone derivative , NES active orally , effective administer via non-oral route vaginal ring ( 2 ) , implant ( 3,4 ) , transdermal system ( 5,6 ) . The CVR delivery system currently investigation contains low dos steroid ( 15µg EE 150µg NES respectively ) , provide relatively steady release rate without require daily administration attention provide desire contraceptive effect achieve regular menstrual cycle . Because CVR require daily oral intake steroid , avoids daily high concentration steroid liver expose repetitive , day administration via oral route . After insertion CVR vagina , steroid rapidly absorb vaginal tissue , pas general circulation , achieve steady state day 4 , ultimately inhibit ovulation ( 2 ) . In begin first cycle , however , `` burst '' effect last 48 hour cause accumulation steroid silastic wall ring follow storage subsequent manufacturing . Based vitro study CVR preliminary pharmacokinetic study , effect decrease significantly subsequent cycle . Pharmacokinetic study confirm find ongoing . After three week use , user remove ring week induce withdrawal bleeding , reinserts three-weeks-in/one-week-out cyclic regimen . The progestin use new contraceptive system , NES , 19-nor progesterone derivative . It select high anti-ovulatory potency low dose potential decrease side effect usually observe 19-nor testosterone derive progestin . In vitro study demonstrate bind selectively progesterone receptor , bind androgen receptor . Although bind glucocorticoid receptor , vivo assay indicate biological activity low dos ( 7 ) . NES also bind estrogen receptor , base study conduct woman use implant contain NES alone , modify greatly lipid profile ( 8 ) . When combined estrogen , data obtain Phase 2 , open label study compare effect NES/EE CVR estrogen-dependent liver protein vs. OC use androgenic progestin ( LNG ) . Data reveal significant increase HDL associate CVR versus decrease OC . In addition , data study demonstrate NES administer vaginally EE CVR , impact hepatic metabolism similar administration EE via oral route hormonal product produce similar increase angiotensinogen . The CVR , however , result significantly great increase SHBG significantly great decrease protein S ( 9 ) suggest due non-androgenic property , NES counterbalance EE effect hepatic factor EE impact liver proteins whether deliver vaginally orally ( 10,11 ) . Therefore , caution contraindication apply OCs relative risk thromboembolic event likely apply CVRs contain EE NES . Since single marker know predict event , clinical experience surveillance woman use new hormonal method require clarify question . The dose select CVR present study base one-year randomized , Phase 2 clinical trial compare three different dos , i.e . 150/15 , 150/20 200/15µg 21/7 day in/out schedule ( 12 ) . All dos show efficacy , good bleeding control satisfactory safety profile , therefore low effective dose , 150/15µg , select . Luteal activity [ progesterone &gt; 10nmol/L ( &gt; 3ng/ml ) ] occur 14 ( 12 % ) 114 monitor cycle 50 woman comprise group use 150/15µg dose . In second study 6 month duration , 150/15µg ring use 21/7 vs. 26/4-day regimen . In two study , user 150/15µg ring 21/7 schedule observe total 61.5 woman year . No pregnancy occur 150/15µg 21/7 group . Overall two study use regimen , few 10 % cycle measure progesterone level indication luteal activity [ progesterone &gt; 10nmol/L ( &gt; 3ng/ml ) ] , suggest ring schedule suppresses ovulation effective degree . Weight significantly correlate luteal activity woman weigh &gt; 90kg showing increase rate luteal activity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy woman , age 18 &lt; 40 year wish use combine hormonal contraceptive . Women intend become pregnant 13 month . Intact uterus ovary . Prior history regular menstrual cycle 28 ± 7 day use hormonal contraception ; postpartum postabortal , history regular menstrual cycle 2135 day length least one cycle ( 2 menses ) cycle length consistent past cycle . Sexually active ( currently ) willing discontinue current contraceptive method participate study . In opinion investigator , able comply protocol , e.g . live within study site catchment area within reasonable distance site . Do meet exclusion criterion . Signed informed consent prior entry trial . Known hypersensitivity estrogens progestin . Known hypersensitivity silicone rubber . Known suspected pregnancy . History infertility &gt; 1.0 year woman male partner . History vasectomy sterility male partner ; tubal ligation ( sterilization ) woman Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding . Undiagnosed vaginal discharge vaginal lesion abnormality . ( Subjects diagnose screen Chlamydia gonorrhea may include trial follow treatment ; partner treatment also recommend . Investigators make determination subject high risk reinfection , e.g . multiple sex partner , untreated partner , whether subject include . ) History pelvic inflammatory disease since last pregnancy episode . History toxic shock syndrome . Current abnormal Pap smear ( woman abnormal Paps ASCUS HPV negative may participate provide follow find per standard care ) . Cystoceles rectoceles anatomical abnormality would preclude use vaginal ring . Women plan undergo major surgery . Smoking woman 35 year 35 year course trial ; Women &lt; 35 year smoke 15 cigarette must evaluate PI inclusion base risk factor would increase risk CVD , e.g . lipid level , glucose level , BP , BMI , family history CVD young age . Breastfeeding . Current past thrombophlebitis thromboembolic disorder .
