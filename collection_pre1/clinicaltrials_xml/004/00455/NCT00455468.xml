	<brief_summary>Pneumonia lead cause childhood morbidity death many develop country include Bangladesh , cause 2 million death worldwide year . Pneumonia infection lung , commonly cause virus bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae . Depending clinical presentation , pneumonia classify severe , severe non-severe , specific treatment except antibiotic therapy . Severe severe pneumonia require hospitalization additional supportive treatment suction , oxygen therapy administration bronchodilator . In Bangladesh , number hospital bed inadequate admission pneumonia case require hospitalization ; however , also important provide institutional care child hospitalize due bed constraint . Provision appropriate antibiotic supportive care period stay establish day-care centre could effective alternative . The impetus study come finding recently complete study title `` Daycare-based management severe pneumonia under-5 child hospitalization possible due lack bed '' . This study successfully manage child ( n=251 ) , randomize trial thus direct comparison efficacy management severe pneumonia day-care centre , essential building confidence implement management policy , possible . We , researcher International Centre Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh , could plan randomize , control trial ( RCT ) ethical reason . Now data suggesting effectiveness well safety day-care base treatment management child severe pneumonia , RCT possible . Two hundred fifty-one child severe pneumonia enrol Radda Clinic June 2003 May 2005 . The mean age 7±7 ( 2-55 ) month , 86 % infant , 63 % boys 91 % breast-fed . History cough present 99 % case , fever 89 % rapid breathe 67 % case . Forty-four percent child febrile ( ≥38°C ) , 93 % child vesicular breath sound 99 % bilateral rale . Fifty-seven percent child hypoxic mean oxygen saturation ( 93±4 ) % , correct oxygen therapy ( 98±3 ) % . Eighty percent child severe pneumonia 20 % severe pneumonia . The mean duration clinic stay ( 7±2 ) day . Two hundred thirty-four ( 93 % ) child complete study successfully , 11 ( 4.4 % ) refer hospital ( one participant visit hospital night due deterioration condition , 9 refer hospital time clinic closure i.e. , 5 pm one participant refer hospital morning hour ) 6 ( 2.4 % ) leave medical advice ( LAMA ) . There death period clinic stay four ( 1.6 % ) death occur 3 month follow-up . The study indicate treatment severe pneumonia child day-care centre effective safe thus comparable hospital care . If day-care base management find comparable efficacy hospitalize management severe pneumonia child could manage outpatient , day-care set ups reduce hospitalization thus free bed management child need hospitalize care . Additionally , availability treatment facility community set-ups cost time save population . Children either sex , age 2-59 month , attend Radda Clinic Institute Child Health Shishu Hospital ( ICHSH ) severe pneumonia randomize receive either day-care management clinic hospitalize management ICHSH . Children randomize receive day-care treatment stay clinic 8 am-5 pm receive antibiotic supportive care . At 5 pm , would send respective home advice bring back child clinic next morning , advise provide support home . The management would continue till improvement discharge follow every 2 week 3 month . Children randomize receive hospitalized management would admit ICHSH receive standard treatment like antibiotic supportive care . The treatment would continue 24 hours/day ( rather 9 hours/day day-care clinic ) till improvement discharge followed-up ICHSH every 2 week 3 month . About 3000 child pneumonia visit Radda Clinic year 200 severe pneumonia require hospitalization . Thus , hope enroll 368 ( 184 site ) child severe pneumonia 2-year study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) Children With Severe Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) , particularly pneumonia lead cause childhood morbidity death develop country include Bangladesh . Acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) cause 2 million child death worldwide year ; death due pneumonia 90 % occur less-developed country . Recent estimate suggest 1.9 million ( 95 % CI 1.6-2.2 million ) child die ARI throughout world 2000 , 70 % occur Africa Southeast Asia . ARI also major cause visit outpatient emergency department well admission hospital . Although bronchiolitis , tracheobronchitis pneumonia , account one-third ALRI case , pneumonia responsible ALRI death . Three study report diagnosis child die ALRI reveal median 89 % ( range 71 % 100 % ) ALRI death associate pneumonia . In Bangladesh , ALRI account 25 % under-5 child death 40 % infantile death . In study conduct Dhaka Hospital International Centre Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh ( ICDDR , B ) 1986-88 among 401 under-5 child ALRI , observe common manifestation pneumonia respiratory pathogen ( bacterial viral ) identify 30 % case . The case fatality rate 14 % bacterial pneumonia 3 % viral pneumonia . Bacterial infection play major role cause pneumonia child develop country . Pooled data lung aspiration study , mostly develop country , report 52-62 % isolation rate bacteria . The case-fatality rate severe ALRI child age 1-4 year 10-15 time higher develop developed country . It infection lung , commonly cause virus bacteria . It usually possible determine specific cause pneumonia either clinical chest X-ray feature . In child , Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae two important bacterial pathogen . Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) also important cause ARI among preschool child . Emerging evidence suggest Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause pneumonia among old child . Available data also suggest mixed viral bacterial infection common child develop country , need treat antibiotic . More recently , data large vaccine trial suggest Streptococcus pneumoniae play major role development pneumonia associate viral infection . The WHO recommendation treatment pneumonia base data Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae common cause bacterial pneumonia develop country . Depending clinical presentation , pneumonia classify severe , severe non-severe specific treatment guideline available . The WHO define severe pneumonia clinical symptom sign pneumonia ( cough difficulty breathe one danger sign like cyanosis , convulsion , drowsiness , stridor calm child inability drink , signify hypoxaemia severe respiratory distress ) severe clinical malnutrition . Severe pneumonia define cough difficulty breathe low chest wall draw without fast breathing define respiratory rate ≥ 50 breath per minute child age 2-11 month ≥ 40 breath per minute child age 12-59 month . Lower chest wall drawing define inward movement bony structure low chest wall inspiration , observe child rest . Finally , non-severe pneumonia define cough difficulty breathe fast breathing define earlier . Antibiotic therapy indicate irrespective severity pneumonia . Proper management child present health centre hospital respiratory symptom cornerstone acute respiratory infection control . To address high mortality associate ALRI , WHO launch programme control ARI major objective reduce child mortality promote rational use antibiotic . Current standard ARI case management recommend child cough normal breathing treat outpatient without antibiotic assume viral infection mild bacterial infection ; rapid respiration ( tachypnoea ) indicate low respiratory infection pneumonia treat antibiotic ambulatory basis ( non-severe pneumonia ) ; chest wall drawing ( indicative severe pneumonia ) admit hospital treat parenteral antibiotic supportive care . Vaccination measles , pertussis , Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) Streptococcus pneumoniae help decrease incidence lessen severity respiratory infection . However , new vaccine respiratory infection Hib pneumococcal conjugate vaccine widely available develop country . Under-5 child respiratory symptom bring general practitioner well primary health care facility treatment . At respective place , health care provider require differentiate acute upper respiratory infection ( AURI ) acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) /pneumonia , categorize severity pneumonia take consideration nutritional status patient provide either ambulatory therapy refer patient hospitalization , appropriate . Severe severe pneumonia require hospitalization additional supportive treatment like oro nasopharyngeal suction , indicate , use suction device ; oxygen therapy hypoxic child , bronchodilator patient bronchospasm , bronchodilatation nebulizer patient fulfill criterion nebulization , fluid nutritional management close monitoring . In Bangladesh , number hospital bed inadequate admission pneumonia case fulfill criteria hospitalization . Hospitalization may also possible inability parent visit hospital due distance , financial reason ( ) , despite appropriate referral . However , also important provide institutional care child hospitalize , least stabilization acute condition . If child send home antibiotic , would important establish expensive , home follow system , without significant proportion would expect fatal outcome . Provision broad-spectrum antibiotic appropriate supportive care period stay establish day-care centre could effective alternative . To examine possibility , recently complete study entitle `` Daycare-based management severe pneumonia under-5 child hospitalization possible due lack bed '' ( ICDDR , B Protocol No . 2002-036 ) Radda MCH-FP Centre , locate Mirpur Section-10 , Dhaka , Bangladesh . The estimated catchment population Radda Clinic 1.5 million . The hypothesis recently complete study would possible provide effective treatment care under-5 child severe pneumonia day-care clinic set , , need hospitalization could significantly reduce . The study examine child , require hospitalization accord WHO guideline hospitalize due reason , could manage day-care facility ( modify primary care set ) , important reduce morbidity importantly deaths among child . We impress result , suggest model management effective . 251 child severe pneumonia enrol Radda Clinic June 2003 May 2005 . The mean age 7±7 ( 2-55 ) month , 86 % infant , 63 % boy , 91 % breast-fed . On admission , history cough present 99 % case , fever 89 % , rapid breathe 67 % difficulty breathe 33 % case . On examination , 44 % child febrile ( ≥38°C ) , 97 % child tachypnoea respiratory rate ≥ 50 per minute 98 % low chest wall draw . On auscultation , 93 % child vesicular breath sound 99 % bilateral rale . Most child well nourished 57 % hypoxic mean oxygen saturation ( 93±4 ) % admission , correct oxygen therapy ( 98±3 ) % . According WHO criterion , 80 % child severe pneumonia 20 % severe pneumonia . The mean duration clinic stay ( 7±2 ) day . 234 ( 93 % ) child complete study successfully without problem , 11 ( 4.4 % ) refer hospital ( one participant visit hospital night due deterioration condition , 9 refer hospital time clinic closure i.e. , 5 pm one participant refer hospital morning hour ) , 6 ( 2.4 % ) leave medical advice ( LAMA ) . There death period clinic stay four ( 1.6 % ) death occur 3 month follow-up period discharge clinic . This study indicate treatment severe pneumonia child day-care centre effective safe thus comparable hospital care . Although study successfully manage child ( n=251 ) , randomize trial thus direct comparison effectiveness management severe pneumonia day-care centre , essential recommend implementation management policy , possible . We could plan RCT due ethical reason recently complete day-care pneumonia study . Now data suggesting effectiveness well safety day-care base treatment care under-5 child severe pneumonia , RCT would possible . In proposed study , would identify under-5 child attend outpatient department Radda Clinic ICHSH severe pneumonia randomize , equal number , management day-care centre ( Radda Clinic ) hospital ( ICHSH ) subject consent respective parents/guardians . Children severe pneumonia , need hospitalization , would enrol need hospital care would unethical stage enroll propose study . About 3000 child clinical diagnosis pneumonia visit clinic year , estimate 200 severe pneumonia require hospitalization - patient population study . We hope enroll requisite 368 ( 184/site ) child severe pneumonia 2-year study period .</detailed_description>
