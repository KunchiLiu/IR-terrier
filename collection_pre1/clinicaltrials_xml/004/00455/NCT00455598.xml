	<brief_title>Placebo Controlled , Dose Escalation Study Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Being Treated With Sulfonylurea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes significant grow world-wide medical burden . Studies provide unequivocal evidence improve glycemic control subject diabetes significantly reduces risk develop complication diabetes ( e.g. , retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy ) . Currently available drug therapy , include use insulin , completely successful restore control glucose metabolism diabetic subject eliminate long-term complication diabetes . These drug , offer specific benefit , also distinct safety tolerability profile . Thus , remain need agent novel mechanism ( ) action . ISIS 113715 inhibitor PTP-1B show enhance sensitivity insulin without development hypoglycemia preclinical study . Further , preclinical study suggest treatment ISIS 113715 may lower serum triglyceride level reduce body weight fat mass . Since substantial portion subject type 2 diabetes obese lipid abnormality , additional potential property ISIS 113715 make attractive potential therapeutic type 2 diabetes . The aim Phase 2A study provide initial assessment safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacology , efficacy ISIS 113715 combination second-generation sulfonylurea type 2 diabetes subject achieve sufficient glycemic control SU alone .</detailed_description>
