	<brief_summary>This amended expansion phase protocol experience dose level 150 mg CPT eq/m2 patient Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) test preliminary anti-tumor activity tumor type . The MTD initially define 113 mg CPT equivalent ( eq ) /m2 dose escalation part study . However , initial expansion phase ( Protocol Amendment 11 ) , 11 patient ( 10 NSCLC patient 1 gastric cancer patient ) dose 113 mg CPT eq/m2 le bone marrow toxicity observe compare heavily pre-treated patient dose escalation part study . Therefore , amend expansion phase investigate safety anti-tumor effect dose 150 mg CPT eq/m2 . The study also determine : - The safety tolerability XMT-1001 150 mg CPT eq/m2 - The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) XMT-1001 ( XMT-1001 behaves body ) patient Stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) small cell lung cancer - Evidence XMT-1001 anti-tumor activity 150 mg CPT eq/m2</brief_summary>
