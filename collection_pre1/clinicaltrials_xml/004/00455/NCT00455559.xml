	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Histologically confirm diagnosis Kit express advanced GIST . This include patient metastatic disease primary tumor consider inoperable . Patients may `` limited '' ( tumor focus progress amenable local therapy ) `` generalize '' ( widespread growth tumor focus ) progression adequate therapy imatinib mesylate . Patients must progression disease imatinib mesylate ( dose great equal 300 milligram daily ) . Patients must document measurable disease CT scan ( &gt; 2 cm conventional CT &gt; 1 cm spiral CT ) . If target lesion previously embolized irradiate , must objective evidence progression lesion per CT scan , postembolization radiate field . Patients must least four week recover acute toxicity prior therapy , include radiation , biotherapy , chemotherapy embolization ( exception imatinib mesylate ) . All patient must progressive disease imatinib define : An increase unidimensional tumor size &gt; 10 % meet criterion PR CT density Any new lesion , include new tumor nodules previously cystic tumor , imatinib therapy Patients performance status 0 2 accord ECOG criterion . Patients must adequate organ function , unless opinion treat investigator , abnormality relate tumor study chairman medical monitor agree abnormality unlikely affect safety perifosine use . Adequate organ marrow function describe protocol . Patients must able ingest oral medication obtain gastrostomy tube . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients must least 18 year age Exclusion Criteria Presence know symptomatic CNS metastases Significant concurrent medical disease GIST , include : New York Heart Association class III IV cardiac problem ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , acute myocardial infarction within 2 month study ) , uncontrolled chronic renal liver disease uncontrolled diabetes uncontrolled seizure disorder active uncontrolled infection organ allograft psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement History active secondary cancer , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree 5 year . Patients receive investigational agent device . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition perifosine ( miltefosine edelfosine ) . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction perifosine . Female patient pregnant lactate ineligible .
