	<brief_summary>Background . Influenza increasingly recognize cause severe respiratory illness child . High-risk infant , like former premature infant , particularly lung disease , influenza hospitalization rate five time higher healthy child . Influenza vaccine protect young child influenza well healthy adult . A small study measure antibody ( protein protect infection ) influenza suggest premature infant get even less protection influenza vaccine full-term infant . More information influenza vaccine premature infant need . The overall goal project collect information well influenza vaccine induces antibody production , develop collaborative network center necessary large trial influenza vaccine premature infant . Objective Hypotheses . The objective study measure amount protective antibody produce influenza vaccine premature ( le 30 week ' [ 7 month ] gestation birth ) , extremely-low-birth-weight ( 1000 gram [ 2¼ pound ] less birth ) infant . Influenza vaccine need give yearly . We assess premature infant first series influenza vaccine . We hypothesize level antibody low premature infant receive first series influenza vaccine full-term infant . Design . We measure immune response premature full term infant . During 2007-2008 influenza season , total 92 subject , divide among 2 group ( premature infant 6-17 month old receive first influenza vaccine series full-term infant 6-17 month old receive first influenza vaccine series ) recruit consortium five center ( University Rochester , University Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Wake Forest University , University Miami State University New York Buffalo ) , receive 2 dos influenza vaccine , antibody immune cell response vaccine component measure 4-6 week second dose vaccine . Potential Impact . If study future investigation suggest way improve premature infant influenza vaccine response , could lead change recommendation number time vaccine dos type vaccine use high-risk group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . Influenza infection cause estimate 1 million death worldwide yearly . Severe influenza respiratory disease increasingly recognize child . Influenza hospitalization rate high-risk infant , premature infant , increase five-fold rate child . Influenza vaccine immunogenicity generally modest even healthy child , influenza vaccine incompletely studied premature infant . Further investigation require optimize vaccine response premature infant . The overall goal project generate estimate effect size variance influenza vaccine immunogenicity use planning large multi-center trial , develop collaborative network center necessary trial . Objective Hypotheses . The primary objective study measure influenza vaccine immunogenicity extremely-low-birth-weight ( ELBW , &lt; 1001 gram birth ) , premature ( &lt; 30 week ' gestation ) infant receive trivalent , inactivate , split-virion influenza vaccine ( TIV ) . We hypothesize geometric mean titer ( GMT ) antibody three vaccine component low ELBW infant receive first series TIV full-term ( FT , &gt; 37 week ' gestation ) , normal-birth-weight ( &gt; 2500 gram ) infant . Specific Aim . To measure humoral cellular immunogenicity influenza vaccine extremely-low-birth-weight ( ELBW , great equal 1000 gram birth ) , premature infant receive trivalent , inactivate , split-virion influenza vaccine ( TIV ) first influenza vaccine series 2007-8 . Design . This prospective , cohort , immunogenicity study estimate GMT influenza ELBW infant , comparison group FT infant . Using establish vaccine study infrastructure consortium five center ( University Rochester , University Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Wake Forest University , University Miami State University New York Buffalo ) , recruit 46 un-immunized ( influenza ) ELBW infant , 6-17 month old 46 un-immunized FT infant , 6-17 month old . Infants receive recommend 2 dos TIV , 4 week apart , blood draw first vaccine dose 4-6 week second . Antibody vaccine component measure hemagglutination inhibition . The frequency hemagglutinin-specific T cell interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IL-4 interferon gamma ( IFNγ ) responses measure ELISPOT assay . The primary outcome influenza GMT . A sample size 46 subject per group provide 80 % power , use two-sided alpha = 0.05 , detect 1.5-fold difference GMT group , assume standard deviation ( SD ) span 0.5 2.0 time value GMT . In addition , five-center consortium monitor quality collaboration , strengthen capability design implementation secure , web-based information system , expand effort seek additional , outside funding implement companion protocol assess live attenuate influenza vaccine premature infant . Potential Impact . This study design assess immunogenicity current generation influenza vaccine premature infant . This future trial assess novel immunization strategy ( additional vaccine dose ) vaccine ( instance , live attenuate influenza virus vaccine ) premature infant could eventually lead tailor specific vaccine strategy high-risk group . In addition , proposal would bring maturity multi-center , collaborative mechanism vaccine trial premature infant .</detailed_description>
