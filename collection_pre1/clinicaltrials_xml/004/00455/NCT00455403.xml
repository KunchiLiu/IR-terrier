	<brief_title>Atheroma Reduction With Chloroquine Patients With Metabolic Syndrome ( ARCH-MS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome one common disorder industrialized country . It consist abnormal serum lipid , glucose intolerance , elevate blood pressure , central obesity set insulin resistance . The syndrome substantially increase risk develop diabetes vascular disease , clear unifying approach treat disorder . In animal , activation protein ataxia telangiectasia mutate ( ATM ) use antimalarial drug chloroquine improve feature metabolic syndrome decrease atherosclerosis , build-up fatty plaque within artery . The purpose study examine effect long-term treatment low dos chloroquine atherosclerosis people metabolic syndrome . At baseline study visit , participant undergo ultrasound neck evaluate carotid artery intima-media thickness ( IMT ) MRI evaluate plaque composition . In addition , blood collect laboratory test blood pressure measure . Participants randomly assign receive either placebo chloroquine . Study visit occur every 3 month 1 year . At visit , blood pressure measure blood collect . At Months 6 12 , repeat ultrasound perform . At month 12 repeat carotid MRI perform . Participants attend one follow-up visit Month 24 undergo final ultrasound . Sub-Study : VEGF Cardiometabolic Risk , ( This observational , case-study exist baseline plasma carotid intimal-medial thickness measurement ) VEGF also closely link vascular disease . From cell culture animal model know VEGF increase atherosclerotic lesion . It controversial whether relationship causative reparative . Both pro- anti-VEGF therapy propose atherosclerosis . However , association VEGF atherosclerosis indicate marker disorder , hypothesis wish test . No previous study circulate VEGF publish . Other marker may relate vascular disease VEGF dataset . Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha result increase expression VEGF may correlate positively VEGF . By Erenna Technology test , cardiac troponin I measure level much low current clinical assay expect elevated ischemia necessarily stable vascular disease anticipated subject . High sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) propose marker vascular disease merit drug treatment right may also correlate VEGF vascular disease . However , currently relationship hsCRP vascular disease completely clear . For preliminary VEGF study observational data baseline study . Baseline test include carotid artery intimal-medial thickness , carotid MRI , lipid panel , complete blood count , comprehensive metabolic chemistry panel , Thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) glucose tolerance test plasma insulin glucose response . Plasma collect baseline ( approximately 1 ml ) transfer Singulex dry ice . Samples cod contain patient identifier . Erenna Technology assay do VEGF-A , cardiac troponin I , TNF-alpha , interleukin-6 , interleukin-17A , cytokine Singulex . This method utilize single-photon counting visible light improve assay sensitivity . Separately , Washington University 's Core Lab Clinical Studies ( CLCS ) determine hsCRP .</detailed_description>

Low HDL cholesterol level : le 50 mg/dL woman le 40 mg/dL men 3 . Hypertension ( great equal 130/85 mm Hg le equal 160/100 mm Hg ) untreated ; hypertension control ( less equal 150/90 mm Hg ) stable medication regimen 4 week prior baseline visit . 4 . Increased waist circumference : great 35 inch woman great 40 inch men 5 . Elevated fast glucose level great equal 100 mg/dL less equal 126 mg/dL Willing use acceptable form birth control Subjects may stable dos statin drug least 3 month Subjects may stable dos Lthyroxine least 3 month Prior travel treatment chloroquine hydroxychloroquine follow : 1 . Any exposure past 2 year 2 . More 30 day therapy exposure 2 5 year ago 3 . More 90 day therapy exposure 5 10 year ago 4 . More 6 month therapy exposure 10 20 year ago 5 . More 1 year therapy exposure 20 30 year ago 6 . No limit last exposure 30 year ago ( e.g. , Vietnam conflict ) Morbid obesity ( body mass index [ BMI ] great 45 ) Coronary artery disease vascular disease History stroke Significant kidney disease ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) Diabetes Seizure disorder History psoriasis Blood disorder , include anemia ( i.e. , hemoglobin level less 13 g/dL men le 12 g/dL woman ) Current malignancy active treatment recurrence prevention , example tamoxifen . Cancer consider cure , either result surgery treatment exclusionary . Asthma require daily beta agonist therapy intermittent oral steroid exclusionary . Inhaled steroid acceptable . Obstructive sleep apnea allow Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) therapy stable 6 month . Other active respiratory disease exclude . Liver disease , liver function test result great twice normal value Active infection , include HIV Serious illness require ongoing medical care medication Treatment atypical antipsychotic medication . Treatment medication psychiatric illness , unless stable dose 6 week prior enrollment . Patients unstable psychiatric disorder exclude per decision study MD regardless medication history . Receiving follow lipid lower medication : niacin , fibrates , fish oil great 1 gram Uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure great equal 150/90 ) baseline visit . Need daily counter medication , currently take cimetidine great 1000 IU vitamin E daily unwilling reduce discontinue use vitamin E discontinue cimetidine duration study . Patients take great 1000 IU vitamin E reduce dose 30 day prior randomization .
