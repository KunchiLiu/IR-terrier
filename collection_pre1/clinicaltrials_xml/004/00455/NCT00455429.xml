	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study JNJ-26113100 Treatment Adult Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study double-blind ( neither researcher participant know treatment participant receiving ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance ; pretend treatment [ drug ] compare clinical trial drug test drug real effect ) , sequential cohort exploratory study evaluate safety effectiveness JNJ-26113100 treatment adult AD moderate severity , include effect inflammatory biomarkers ( biological molecule find blood , body fluid , tissue sign normal abnormal process , condition disease ) . Participants sequentially assign 50 milligram ( mg ) daily , 100 mg daily , 100 mg twice daily 250 mg twice daily cohort randomly assign receive JNJ-26113100 matching placebo . The total duration study approximately 8 week . Participants ask follow-up end Week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 . A study termination visit ( Day 57 ) conduct end Week 8 . Skin biopsies atopic dermatitis lesion collect study ass change inflammatory disease state . Participants develop flare disease may treat triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 percent ointment twice daily 7 day . Efficacy assess use Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA ) , Eczema Area Severity Index ( EASI ) Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . Blood urine sample collect standard safety laboratory test , measure level drug effect drug inflammatory biomarkers . Participant 's safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
