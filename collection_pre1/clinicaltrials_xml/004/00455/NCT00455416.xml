	<detailed_description>Dietary factor play important role prevention several disease . The cardiovascular disease mortality drop dramatically last 20 year , relative death rate cancer remain fairly stable . There reason believe factor tumor microenvironment great importance outcome many malignant disease , include FL . Factors predict poor outcome associate inflammation , oxidative stress impair host immune response produce growth stimulatory signal . In open study 45 patient include seek perform dietary intervention comparison apoptosis rate , proliferation rate immune cell infiltrate intervention period .</detailed_description>
