	<brief_title>PLASMA Trial : A Dose-Response Study A-002 In Subjects With Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A-002 represent novel therapy treatment atherosclerosis coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Through inhibition activity A-002 may provide multifunctional activity direct key facet disease process , namely ) inflammation , b ) atherogenic lipid profile c ) atherosclerotic process . Non-clinical clinical data recent study demonstrate benefit early aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy reduce cardiovascular risk . Recent clinical study provide strong association level cardiovascular event risk . The proposed Phase 2 clinical pharmacology study ( Study No . AN-CVD-2221 ) examine effect 4 different dos A-002 compare placebo , enzyme level activity 8 week treatment . In addition , effect treatment inflammatory marker cardiovascular risk ( C-reactive protein [ CRP ] ) , lipid level lipoprotein subclasses soluble biomarkers ( e.g. , ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , TNF , MCP-1 etc ) also assess .</detailed_description>
