	<brief_summary>The primary goal study determine effect ( good bad ) Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) combination CHOP-R diffuse Large B cell Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The standard care DLBCL combination drug know CHOP-Rituximab ( CHOP-R ) . The drug make CHOP-R chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin vincristine , prednisone rituximab . GM-CSF drug stimulates immune system increase number white blood cell . Previous research show GM-CSF might help rituximab effective treat lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHOP-Rituximab Augmented With GM-CSF Patients With Previously Untreated Diffuse Large B Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Study treatment divide 21-day time period call cycle . Almost participant treat outpatient unless exist medical problem require treated inpatient . - The drug use study treatment standard care type lymphoma participant could receive even take part study . - Participants start receive GM-CSF 11 day Day 1 Cycle 1 10 day . They receive first dose GM-CSF clinic . At least 1 1/2 day last GM-CSF injection ( Day 1 ) , receive chemotherapy ( CHOP-R ) . Eleven day start next cycle ( Days 11-20 ) , start receive GM-CSF injection 10 day . - Participants receive 6 cycle study treatment disease respond tolerate study treatment . - Additional medication may give prevent lung infection , return brain nervous system disease tumor lysis syndrome . - Before begin GM-CSF cycle treatment blood drawn monitor participant health check side effect . - On Day 1 cycle physical examination blood test perform . On Day 7 Day 14 cycle , routine blood test also do . - After Cycle 2 4 CT scan neck , chest , abdomen pelvis perform check status participant disease . - After 6 cycle study treatment , participant return clinic End Treatment Visit . At visit physical exam , routine blood test , CT scan neck , chest , abdomen pelvis perform . - The participant ask return clinic every 3 month first year study treatment every 6 month 2 year study treatment procedure outline End Treatment Visit .</detailed_description>
