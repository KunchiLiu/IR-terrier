	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy become standard care breast cancer patient large tumor order render operable mastectomy , case , lumpectomy radiation therapy . Building theme , several large hormonal therapy extensively investigate neoadjuvant setting , together biologic correlate response resistance . As extension , neoadjuvant therapy biologic agent , investigate biologic evidence efficacy large-scale clinical trial thousand patient embark . The neoadjuvant setting especially attractive study several reason include early assessment response therapy , biopsiable access primary tumor , considerable reduced sample size compare required adjuvant setting . In addition , clinical response neoadjuvant chemotherapy validate surrogate marker improve survival . It may use test overall efficacy neoadjuvant treatment regimens mirror effect therapy micrometastases set . In recent study , good clinical response neoadjuvant chemotherapy independent variable , multivariate analysis , associate decreased risk death . GW572016 new promise dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor HER1/2 . Hundreds patient treat phase I II study world-wide result indicate reversible , oral small molecule generally well-tolerated . Studies neoadjuvant Trastuzumab indicate HER2 interference lead significant tumor regression even 3 week monotherapy . We aim extend finding novel agent , GW572016 may effective , especially vitro data , discover true response rate inhibit HER1/2 signal transduction breast cancer patient .</brief_summary>
