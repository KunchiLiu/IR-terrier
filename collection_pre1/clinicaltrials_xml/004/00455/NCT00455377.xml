	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Former study present conflict data association exposure Portland cement dust respiratory effect . Our goal examine inflammation airways peripheral blood subject expose cement-dust . METHODS : All non smoking , dust expose , worker one department large cement plant Norway , invited participate . The worker perform spirometry induce sputum ( IS ) period regular work cement dust exposure , minimum 5 day without exposure . Information respiratory symptom , allergy former respiratory disease give self-reported questionnaire . IS perform processed describe Pin et al . Differential cell count carry . Inflammatory marker induce sputum peripheral blood measure . We want use crossover design case use control , also include external control .</detailed_description>
