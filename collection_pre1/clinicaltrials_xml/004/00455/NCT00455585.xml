	<brief_title>Comparison Plasma Drug Levels Triomune 40 With Those Originator Products</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) revolutionise treatment HIV/AIDS . ART associate significant reduction morbidity mortality mainly wealthy country Brazil . ART consist cocktail least three different potent anti-HIV drug , adopt standard care management HIV disease develop country . The major constraint widespread use antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) develop country high cost drug acquisition associate monitoring test . The drug acquisition cost innovator ARV range €12,000 €20,000 per patient per year . This compare annual cost 558,000 Ugandan shill €260 per patient per year Triomune , commonly generically manufacture ARV . Triomune exist two formulation , Triomune 40 Triomune 30 , manufacture Cipla Mumbai , India . Both contain nevirapine 200mg lamivudine 150mg , however Triomune 40 contains stavudine 40mg Triomune 30 contains stavudine 30mg . This allow fact person weigh &gt; 60kg require dose stavudine 40mg weigh &lt; 60kg require dose stavudine 30mg . Therefore patient weigh &gt; 60kg Tiomune 40 prescribed , patient &lt; 60kg Triomune 30 prescribed . At time study design majority patient attend Infectious Diseases Institute , Mulago Hospital receive ARV Triomune &gt; 60kg therefore receive Triomune 40 . The available pharmacokinetic data Triomune limit single dose study healthy Indian volunteer perform manufacturer Triomune , Cipla Mumbai one independent bioequivalence study steady state pharmacokinetic parameter Triomune HIV infect patient Malawi . Of concern study Triomune find bioequivalent originator product significantly high d4T level patient Triomune compare originator product . In study patient also report side-effects , principally peripheral neuropathy , take Triomune author postulate may result high d4T level patient . It also note nevirapine level markedly high Malawians compare western subject weight , possibly due genetic metabolic difference . The author conclude similar evaluation drug exposure perform medication introduce new population . A study Cameroon examine clinical outcome 60 patient treat Triomune 24 week period . This important study Laurent et al . first publish study address issue quality generic drug , point , clinical trial assess effectiveness , safety quality fix dose combination drug resource limit environment . The study however several limitation . As author acknowledge sample size small therefore `` powerful control trial '' . There comparison group take brand ( proprietary ) drug . The study time 24 week short satisfactorily assess efficacy drugs- European medicine Agency ( EMEA ) , European drug regulatory authority , require study period 48 week assessment efficacy . Some major drug study compare different drug combination see significant difference viral load suppression 24 week mark difference 48 week . Laurent et al . perform vitro dissolution test drug study ; however translate bioequivalence . There bioequivalence data study . The author measure plasma trough drug level three time point measure adherence measurement use confirm bioequivalence . Comparison ( ) Steady state level stavudine , lamvivudine nevirapine HIV positive patient take Triomune 40 one month compare steady state level agent originator product Zerit 40 , Epivir Viramune take one month , patient act control . Pharmacogenomics Pharmacogenomics study effect genetic variation drug disposition . It grow area research emerge data support genomic difference antiretroviral drug level relate toxicity . There increase evidence drug disposition vary ethnic group . In case due different expression gene encode various component cytochrome system , others felt link vary expression gene encode drug transporter . There currently extremely limited data area relating Africans . By store blood sample subject enrol pharmacokinetic study large unique pharmacogenomic resource would build Makerere University .</detailed_description>
