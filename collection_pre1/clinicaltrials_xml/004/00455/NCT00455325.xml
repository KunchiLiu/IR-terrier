	<brief_title>Chloroquine Treat People With Metabolic Syndrome Aim2 ( ARCH-MS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome one common disorder industrialized country . It consist abnormal serum lipid , glucose intolerance , elevate blood pressure , central obesity set insulin resistance . The syndrome substantially increase risk develop diabetes vascular disease , clear unifying approach treat disorder . In animal , activation protein ataxia telangiectasia mutate ( ATM ) use antimalarial drug chloroquine improve feature metabolic syndrome decrease atherosclerosis , build-up fatty plaque within artery . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness short-term treatment low dos chloroquine way manage metabolic syndrome . Participants study initially receive placebo 3 week , follow increase dos chloroquine 3-week interval . There period active treatment 5 7 week arm . At end 3-week period , participant admit research center undergo insulin sensitivity test hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure . In addition , blood collect blood pressure measure .</detailed_description>

Low HDL cholesterol level : le 50 mg/dL woman le 40 mg/dL men 3 . Hypertension ( = &gt; 130/85 mm Hg = &lt; 160/100 mm Hg ) untreated ; hypertension control ( = &lt; 150/90 mm Hg ) stable medication regimen 4 week prior baseline visit . 4 . Increased waist circumference : great 35 inch woman great 40 inch men 5 . Elevated fast glucose level = &lt; 100 mg/dL = &gt; 126 mg/dL Subjects may stable dos statin drug least 3 month Subjects may stable dos Lthyroxine least 3 month Willing use acceptable form birth control ( e.g. , hormonal birth control , double barrier method ) Prior travel treatment chloroquine hydroxychloroquine follow : 1. exposure past 2 year , 2 . &gt; 30 day therapy exposure 2 5 year ago , 3 . &gt; 90 day therapy exposure 5 10 year ago , 4 . &gt; 6 month therapy exposure 10 20 year ago , 5 . &gt; 1 year therapy exposure 20 30 year ago , 6 . No limit last exposure &gt; 30 year ago , ex . Vietnam conflict . Morbid obesity ( body mass index [ BMI ] great 45 ) Coronary artery disease vascular disease History stroke Chronic kidney insufficiency ( i.e. , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 60 ml/min/1.73m2 ) Diabetes Seizure disorder History psoriasis Blood disorder , include anemia ( i.e. , hemoglobin level less 13 g/dL men le 12 g/dL woman ) Current malignancy active treatment recurrence prevention , example tamoxifen . Cancer consider cure , either result surgery treatment exclusionary . Asthma require daily beta agonist therapy intermittent oral steroid exclusionary . Inhaled steroid acceptable . Obstructive sleep apnea allow Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) therapy stable 6 month . Other active respiratory disease exclude . Liver disease , liver function test result great twice normal value Active infection , include HIV Serious illness require ongoing medical care medication Treatment atypical antipsychotic medication . Treatment medication psychiatric illness , unless stable dose 6 week prior enrollment . Patients unstable psychiatric disorder exclude per decision study MD regardless medication history .
