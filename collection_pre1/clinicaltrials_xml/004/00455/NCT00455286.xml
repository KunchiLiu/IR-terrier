Concurrent treatment experimental drug . 6 PLAN OF THE STUDY 6.1 Study Design This open-label , multi-center phase II study design access response rate ( include CR , CRu PR , definition refers 10.2.2 ) patient primary central nervous system lymphoma receive MS follow CCRT temozolomide . The secondary objective access time progression safety combination patient population . 6.2 Sample Size The primary end point phase II study objective tumor response rate . This study two-stage design test non-inferiority propose treatment compare approximately 80 % response rate report conventional treatment . Assuming non-inferiority margin 20 % , sample size 25 subject , provide 80 % power establishment non-inferiority , select base method describe Batchelor et al.7 At first stage , 15 subject enrol . If few six patient respond ( one-sided 93 % upper bound observe response rate lower 60 % ) , study would terminate . Otherwise , study would accrue additional 10 subject . At end second stage , one-sided low 95 % confidence limit point estimate response rate great equal 60 % , hypothesis study treatment inferior conventional treatment would reject . 7.2 Treatments Schedules • Patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion receive induction chemotherapy ( MS regimen ) . - If patient leptomeningeal involvement CSF+ diagnosis , intrathecal methotrexate give period induction chemotherapy . - Two 4 week completion induction chemotherapy , disease confine within brain parenchyma completely remit , concurrent temozolomide whole brain radiation start . ( Table 1. example 2 week induction chemotherapy ) . - If disease beyond brain parenchyma persistent leptomeningeal involvement completion induction chemotherapy , patient take study . 7.3 Induction Chemotherapy ( MS regimen ) - Methotrexate 3.5 g/m2 i.v . infusion 4 hour day1 - Methylprednisolone 200 mg/m2/day i.v . infusion 30 minute , day1-4 1 . Cycles repeat every 2 week week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , evidence disease progression . 2 . Sample order detail Appendix V. 3 . Hydration urine alkalization : It mandatory patient receive adequate hydration urine alkalization ( keep urine pH &gt; 7 ) post methotrexate infusion . 4 . Antiemetics : All patient could receive prophylactic antiemetic medication 30 minute methotrexate infusion . 5-HT3 antagonist recommend . 5 . Leucovorin rescue : Leucovorin 30 mg i.v . every 6 hour start since 24 hour start methotrexate infusion serum methotrexate level le 0.05 mcM least 8 dos . - In patient delay early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence acute renal injury ( serum methotrexate level 50 mcM 24 hour , 5 mcM 48 hour administration , serum creatinine≧ 2.0 mg/dL 24 hour ) give leucovorin 150 mg IV every 3 hour methotrexate level le 1 mcM 30 mg IV every 6 hour methotrexate level le 0.05 mcM . - In patient delay late methotrexate elimination ( serum methotrexate level remain 0.2 mcM 72 hour 0.05 mcM 96 hour administration ) , continue leucovorin 30 mg i.v . every 6 hour methotrexate level le 0.05 mcM ; 6 . Others : Allopurinol antacid recommend first 5 day cycle . 7.4 Intrathecal Methotrexate - Methotrexate 12 mg intrathecal injection day 8 induction chemotherapy 1 . Only leptomeningeal involvement CSF cytology positive . 2 . Cycles repeat every 2 week week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , evidence disease progression . If induction chemotherapy MS delay , intrathecal methotrexate schedule decide treat physician . 3 . If CSF+ newly find treatment , patient must protocol . 4 . Leucovorin 15 mg p.o . bid use 24 hour intrathecal methotrexate 3 day . 7.5 Concurrent Whole Brain Radiation Temozolomide 7.5.1 Whole Brain Radiation Therapy - Whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) 2 Gy per fraction daily , 5 day per week 1 . For patient CR CRu induction chemotherapy , total 30 Gy give ; patient non-CR/ CRu induction chemotherapy , total 36 Gy give . 2 . WBRT initiate within 2-4 week start last induction chemotherapy active infection life threaten complication note . 3 . Continuation WBRT schedule suggest unless treat physician judge patient ’ condition inappropriate receive WBRT . 4 . Physical Factors : Treatment deliver use megavoltage machine photon beam range 4 8 MV . The minimum dose rate midplane brain central axis must 0.50 Gy/minute . Electron , particle , implant therapy permissible . 5 . Simulation , Immobilization , Localization : The patient treat supine position . Adequate immobilization reproducibility position encourage . The target volume cover brain meninges foramen magnum . 6 . Treatment Planning : Treatments must deliver parallel oppose 5 degree RAO-LAO field cover entire cranial content . There beam fall-off least 1 cm . The eye exclude beam either field arrangement shield . 7 . Stereotactic radiosurgery intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) allow . 7.5.2 Temozolomide - Temozolomide 75 mg/m2/day orally daily , day WBRT 1 . Criteria start Temozolomide : The initiation temozolomide base upon complete blood count ( CBC ) obtain within 48 hour prior start treatment . If ANC ≥ 1,000/mm3 platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 , temozolomide may start . If study drug administer schedule day dose , CBC repeat every 3 day . 2 . Since capsule study drug available 20 100 mg capsule Taiwan , dose rounded nearest 20 mg accommodate capsule strength . 3 . Subjects instruct swallow capsule whole rapid succession chew capsule . If vomiting occurs course treatment , re-dosing subject allow next schedule dose . 4 . Temozolomide take empty stomach . It administer approximately time every day within cycle . In general , patient tolerability best drug give bedtime antiemetic one hour prior temozolomide . 5 . Since oral drug , episodes emesis result dose . Prophylactic antiemetic ( oral metoclopramide prefer , either oral intravenous administration 5-HT3 antagonist could also use intolerable response metoclopramide ) must administer subject prior temozolomide administration . 7.6 Concomitant Treatments Concomitant medication allow allow described : Allowed : • Ancillary treatment give medically indicate . • Antiemetics antiallergic medication permit . Proton pump inhibitor H2 block permit prevention treatment steroid relate peptic ulcer . • G-CSF recommended patient absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 500 /mm3 , neutropenic fever document infection neutropenic . Prophylactic use G-CSF could decide treat physician . • Preventive oral i.v . antibiotic neutropenia &lt; 500/mm3 without fever recommend , decision use antibiotic case leave current policy within different hospital . • Lamivudine 100 mg orally day recommend HBV carrier prevent HBV reactivation whole treatment period . - Prophylactic anticonvulsant agent recommend . For patient seizure anticonvulsant agent could use without dose adjustment chemotherapy . Not Allowed : • The patient receive investigational drug anticancer treatment study . 7.7 Recommended Treatment Progression Residual Disease If patient progression disease treatment residual disease concurrent whole brain chemoradiation , treatment decide treated physician . We recommend BOMES16 regimen without modification patient suitable general condition . 9 OFF-STUDY CRITERIA A patient discontinue study follow circumstance • Disease progression beyond brain parenchyma protocol treatment • Residual disease relapse completion WBRT - Treatment schedule delay longer 35 day - Patients ’ do dose reduction list section 8.1 8.2 . - Patients develop condition exclusion criterion - Patients poor compliance - Patient wish withdraw study his/her request</detailed_description>
