	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . WX-671 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gemcitabine together WX-671 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well gemcitabine work give together WX-671 give alone treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Without WX-671 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess antitumor activity two different dos anti-uPA serine protease inhibitor WX-671 give combination gemcitabine hydrochloride patient locally advance unresectable pancreatic cancer . - Compare efficacy , term response rate , progression-free survival , time first metastasis , overall survival , tumor uPA system-related marker , regimens patient . - Compare safety , term vital sign , ECG , biochemistry , hematology ( include coagulation ) , adverse event , regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral anti-uPA serine protease inhibitor WX-671 daily week 1-8 ( week 1-4 subsequent course ) gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute weekly week 1-7 ( week 1-3 subsequent course ) course 1 . All subsequent course repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral anti-uPA serine protease inhibitor WX-671 ( low dose arm I ) daily week 1-8 ( week 1-4 subsequent course ) gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute weekly week 1-7 ( week 1-3 subsequent course ) course 1 . All subsequent course repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm III : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute weekly week 1-7 ( week 1-3 subsequent course ) course 1 . All subsequent course repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
