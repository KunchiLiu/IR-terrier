	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib hydrochloride celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Celecoxib may also stop growth lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together celecoxib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give erlotinib hydrochloride together celecoxib work compare erlotinib hydrochloride alone treat patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride With Without Celecoxib Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Comparison progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient receive erlotinib + celecoxib vs. erlotinib + placebo advance NSCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objective tumor response rate define RECIST Criteria subject receive erlotinib/celecoxib treatment arm . II . Categorize change e-cadherin expression baseline week 8 subset subject . III . Evaluation overall survival ( OS ) . IV . Measurement COX-2 , EGFR immunohistochemistry EGFR amplification FISH , EGFR mutation status correlate clinical response . V. Measurement change urinary PGE-M correlation response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily oral placebo twice daily day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-28 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
