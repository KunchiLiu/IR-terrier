	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research learn RAD001 give combination chemotherapy turn signal pathway ( chain information tell cancer cell grow quickly ) make chemotherapy give study effective . Primary Objective Â· To determine addition mTOR inhibitor standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient triple receptor-negative breast cancer cause molecular change ( inhibition/activation ) PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway . Secondary Objectives - To evaluate pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate treatment group . - To evaluate relationship pCR molecular change ( inhibition/activation ) PI13K/PTEN/AKT pathway treatment group . - To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) treatment group . - To assess toxicity regimen evaluate relationship toxicity PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RAD001 new drug design block protein important development growth cancer . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , result cell death . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam . Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test test amount fat blood . You chest x-ray , bone scan 2-D echocardiogram ( test evaluate pump function heart ) . You compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest abdomen ( stomach area ) . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 tablespoon ) pregnancy test . You mammogram ultrasound breast armpit record tumor size . As part study , fine needle biopsy breast tumor test signal pathway . You receive separate consent form mammogram , ultrasound , biopsy procedure discuss detail . The fine needle biopsy procedure would perform study . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . You equal chance assign either group . If assign Group 1 , receive paclitaxel week needle vein 1 hour . You total 12 treatment . Before treatment , may also receive drug help prevent reduce risk side effect paclitaxel . If assign Group 2 , receive paclitaxel RAD001 . You receive paclitaxel week needle vein 1 hour . You total 12 treatment . Before treatment , may also receive drug help prevent reduce risk side effect paclitaxel . You take RAD001 , mouth , day receive paclitaxel . You take RAD001 empty stomach light meal . Pills take package staff ready take , since damage light humidity . Participants group blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test weekly dose chemotherapy . You second fine needle biopsy 2 day start treatment . This do check see signal pathway affect . After 12 week treatment paclitaxel paclitaxel RAD001 , ultrasound tumor visible , fine needle biopsy check see signal pathway affect . After 12 week treatment either paclitaxel paclitaxel RAD001 , begin treatment 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide . This drug combination call FEC . You receive FEC needle vein ( 1 hour ) every 3 week . You 4 treatment ( 12 week total ) . Before treatment , may also receive drug help prevent reduce risk side effect FEC . Once finish treatment FEC , mammogram ultrasound check status disease . This mammogram ultrasound also use doctor decide whether remove part breast and/or nearby lymph node surgery . You surgery remove part breast tumor . If sign lymph node armpit contain cancer , lymph node also remove . You receive separate consent form procedure doctor discuss detail . If available , portion leave tumor tissue collect check see signal pathway affect . You consider `` study '' surgery . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Paclitaxel , 5-fluorouracil , cyclophosphamide , epirubicin FDA approve commercially available . RAD001 FDA approve commercially available . It authorize use research . Up 50 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
