This particular concern give provincial initiative goal increase proportion patient treat PD current 18 % 30 % 2010 . The primary objective study determine patient treat home care assist peritoneal dialysis likely hospitalize compare treated in-centre hemodialysis . The secondary objective study compare occurrence important outcome event include need access-related procedure , technique survival , death patient home care assist peritoneal dialysis compare in-centre hemodialysis .</detailed_description>
