	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( Abraxane® ) , term frequency duration objective response , patient persistent recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( Abraxane® ) IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
