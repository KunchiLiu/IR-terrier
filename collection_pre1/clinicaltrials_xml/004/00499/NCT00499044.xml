	<brief_summary>The investigator compare test-retest reliability two cognitive battery people schizophrenia : Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Cognitive Assessment System ( `` CDR '' ) MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( `` MCCB '' ) . The investigator hypothesize statistically significant difference test-retest reliability MCCB CDR . In addition , investigator hypothesize two battery well measure certain area cognition . The investigator also hypothesize score battery correlate quality life score , significant difference correlation MCCB CDR . The investigator hypothesize significant difference patient ' self-reported tolerability satisfaction MATRICS versus CDR assessment . Lastly , investigator hypothesize significant difference MATRICS versus CDR battery respect administrator-rated score practicality . Approximately 32 subject enroll study . Following consent eligibility screening ( visit 1 ) baseline clinical assessment training use CDR battery ( visit 2 ) , subject randomize one two group visit 3 4 . One group complete CDR MCCB visit 3 , well Tolerability Scale battery . The group complete battery reverse order visit 3 . Each group complete battery reverse order visit 4 . Randomization do block 2 . After completion every 4 subject , study administrator complete Practicality Scale battery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Cognitive Batteries People With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Institute Mental Health 's Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia ( MATRICS ) program collaboration member academia , industry , government , goal furthering development drug treatment cognitive deficit schizophrenia . The program lead creation MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB ) , measure function across various cognitive domain , attention , work memory ( verbal nonverbal ) , learn ( verbal visual ) , reason problem solving , social cognition . Its measurement base timed paper pencil , computerize , orally administer test , well spatial test use geometric cube . Cognitive Drug Research ( CDR ) United Kingdom-based company develop another battery assessments capable measure cognitive function patient schizophrenia . Its Computerized Cognitive Assessment System consist performance task measure reaction time , numeric spatial work memory , word picture recall recognition , episodic secondary memory . CDR single , unified battery store administered use laptop computer . Cognitive assessment important establish efficacy medication therapeutic intervention improve cognitive function patient schizophrenia . Furthermore , cognitive functioning correlate patient ' ability operate real world . This study aim examine test-retest reliability CDR MATRICS cognitive battery , thereby gauge value use study cognitive function people schizophrenia . The investigator hypothesize patient schizophrenia significant difference test-retest reliability two battery . Additional aim investigate extent MCCB CDR measure function specific cognitive domain investigate patient tolerability overall practicality battery . Visit 1 ( 1.5 hour ) : Baseline Measures Screening - Consent - Review medical chart confirm DSM-IV diagnosis schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder ( depressed type ) medical/psychiatric stability - Demographic questionnaire - Salivary drug test exclude current use PCP , cannabis , alcohol , cocaine , amphetamine , methamphetamine , opiates Visit 2 ( 2 hour ) : Clinical Assessment Training - Clinical Rating Scales : Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , Quality Life Scale ( QLS ) - CDR training Visits 3 4 ( 2.5 hour ) : Patients randomize one two group : Group 1 - Visit 3 : CDR battery follow MATRICS battery ( short break ) ; Tolerability Scale battery . - Visit 4 ( two week Visit 3 ) : MATRICS battery follow CDR battery ( short break ) ; Tolerability Scale battery . Group 2 - Visit 3 : MATRICS battery follow CDR battery ( short break ) ; Tolerability Scale battery . - Visit 4 ( two week Visit 3 ) : CDR battery follow MATRICS battery ( short break ) ; Tolerability Scale battery . Subjects undergo screen visit chart review assure clinical appropriateness safety participation . Subjects free withdraw study stage without give reason .</detailed_description>
