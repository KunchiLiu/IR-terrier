	<detailed_description>1 . What characteristics joint replacement patient ( DRGs 209 &amp; 210 ) serve IRFs SNFs ? How similar different ? We need know systematic difference among joint replacement patient serve setting take account evaluate outcome cost effectiveness outline . See also Question 6 . 2 . How intervention process care joint replacement patient different IRFs SNFs ? How best characterize difference care receive IRF vs. SNF ? What make care IRF SNF different ? What similarly differently ? Consider intervention , e.g. , nursing service , physician intervention , physical occupational therapy , nutritional support , medication , passive motion exercise , weight-bearing exercise . Also consider time , intensity , frequency , duration therapy . 3 . What specific intervention combination intervention IRFs SNFs make big difference outcome joint replacement patient take account patient difference ? The relevant outcome study include : ( 1 ) onset complication course treatment , ( 2 ) change severity illness admission discharge , ( 3 ) discharge destination ( include unscheduled discharge acute care ) , ( 4 ) change functional status admission discharge . We consider ( 5 ) rehospitalizations readmission first 3-6 month follow discharge post-acute care . 4 . Which joint replacement patient well IRF well SNF ? How best characterize difference patient better one setting ? How characterization assist develop post-acute placement criterion characterize patient mix use define IRF pursuant 75 % rule ? 5 . What relative cost-effectiveness IRF SNF care joint replacement patient ? For patient cost-effective placed IRF patient SNF take account outcomes discharge rehospitalizations first 3-6 month follow discharge ? 6 . Are comorbidities among joint replacement patient adequate indicator additional medical need rehabilitation process ? Can severity-of-illness measure serve good indicator medical need ? Are patient great medical need serve well IRF SNF ? Do comorbidities severity illness indicator well predictive validity term service utilization , cost , outcome ? 7 . Can design efficient course rehabilitation intervention joint replacement patient IRFs SNFs reduce length stay cost ?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Are 21 year age old , Received hip knee replacement type reason , Admitted source . To include study â€™ database , enrollment criterion need meet . In addition , patient also must : Have minimum rehabilitation length stay ( LOS ) 3 day , Have complete admission discharge FIM data . Joint replacement shoulder ankle replacement since rehabilitation patient quite different . For study patient , joint replacement first , age population , revision become common . According MedPACRAND report , 4.8 % IRF 6.3 % SNF joint replacement patient revision .</criteria>
