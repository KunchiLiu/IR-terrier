	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy sunitinib malate patient recurrent malignant glioma measure 6-month progression-free survival . II . To determine low dose sunitinib malate patient receive enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants would achieve similar serum drug metabolite concentration patient receive enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant maximum tolerate dose population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine toxicity safety sunitinib malate patient note tumor . II . To evaluate tumor response state patient . III . To evaluate progression-free overall survival state patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord use enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant ( EIAC ) ( yes v ) . STRATUM 1 ( non-EIAC ) : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily 4 consecutive week follow 2 week rest . STRATUM 2 ( EIAC &amp; OSU patient ) : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate stratum 1 . Patients receive escalate dos oral sunitinib malate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic study . Samples analyze plasma concentration sunitinib malate via LC/MS/MS method . In stratum , treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
