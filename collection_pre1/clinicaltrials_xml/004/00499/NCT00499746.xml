	<brief_summary>This research part set study whose purpose test whether tramadol use treatment opioid addiction . Tramadol already available United States pain medicine market Ultram . It effect similar morphine , may also effect similar drug like stimulant . The dos tramadol use study higher generally use treatment pain . To study participant must user opioids ( drug like heroin ) stimulant ( drug like cocaine ) , addict either . The person must 21-55 year old , generally healthy . Up 12 people take part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This human laboratory study test effect tramadol step possible development medication new treatment opioid dependence . Tramadol mild/moderate mu agonist opioid currently market analgesic unique profile effect . One primary metabolite tramadol , mono-O-demethyltramadol ( referred M1 ) exert opioid agonist effect mu receptor . In addition , tramadol M1 produce reuptake blockade monoamine , latter effect may positively influence analgesic efficacy , addition influence subjective effect produce tramadol . Preclinical evidence suggest tramadol 's effect monoamine reuptake may antidepressant quality well . Given tramadol 's diverse pharmacodynamic profile , systematic characterization subjective effect opioid-experienced subject would provide valuable information regard abuse liability , potential utility treatment opioid dependence . The characterization opioid medication 's profile accomplish variety experimental procedure . One useful procedure assess profile opioid drug discrimination procedure . In methodology , subject first trained discriminate reference drug placebo opioid agonist , administer dos novel compound determine like ( unlike ) reference training condition . Our laboratory long history use drug discrimination methodology study characterize opioids vary opioid receptor activity profile . Studies generally include either two three training condition human . Using technique volunteer , study characterize profile number opioids include ( example ) butorphanol , nalbuphine , pentazocine , buprenorphine . While study test effect mixed agonist-antagonist opioids use opioid agonist placebo training condition , tramadol 's profile effect suggest may non-opioid component action serotonin norepinephrine sit useful distinguish . In particular , interest determine extent tramadol identify like prototypic mu agonist opioid , whether substantially identify like non-opioid compound , non-opioid component relate enhancement monoamine effect . In order provide meaningful non-opioid contrast training condition , study compare different dos tramadol train condition placebo , mu agonist opioid , prototypic stimulant . Overall , evaluation provide great understanding subjective effect profile tramadol comparison prototypic mu opioid prototypic stimulant . If tramadol useful treatment opioid dependence , thorough assessment subjective effect experience opioid stimulant abuser warrant .</detailed_description>
