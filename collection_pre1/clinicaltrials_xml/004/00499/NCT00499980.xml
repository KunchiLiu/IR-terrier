	<detailed_description>Breast cancer lead cause cancer among woman United States . It always hope devise method early detection would lead improvement long-term survival . Therefore , development novel , selective , noninvasive diagnostic technique priority . Mammography currently commonly use breast image modality screen diagnostic purpose . Additionally , breast ultrasound image breast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) generally use supplement help confirm indeterminate suspicious find prior consideration breast biopsy . However , conventional imaging method lack information tissue function lower diagnostic accuracy . Most recently , near infrared ( NIR , wavelength 700-900 nm ) optical diffuse spectroscopic image investigate novel diagnostic tool breast cancer . In near-infrared ( NIR ) light spectrum , oxygenate hemoglobin deoxygenate hemoglobin major chromosphere tissue , absorption spectrum two hemoglobin state differ across wavelength . Thus , many contemporary attempt use intra-tissue absorption scatter NIR light quantify functional tissue parameter hemoglobin concentration ( HbT ) oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) , include tumor differentiation within human breast . To good approximation , NIR photon diffuse relatively thick tissue , several centimeter human breast . Functional image NIR light offer several novel tissue parameter differentiate tumor normal breast tissue . For example , hemoglobin de-saturation tumor may increase due high oxygen demand cancer blood volume may increase normal background tissue due great vascularization metabolic need cancer . While NIR image provide additional physiological parameter potentially help improve specificity breast cancer diagnosis , relatively low spatial resolution make unsuitable morphological analysis . The resolution NIR system intrinsically limited diffusive nature near infrared light tissue . Currently , typical instrument distinguish simple structure approximately 1 cm size ; sharp edge typically blur millimeter . It propose image technique combine near infrared ultrasound modality potential fully utilize complementary feature overcome deficiency . This protocol define clinical study prove concept near infrared/ ultrasound dual modal image evaluate sensitivity specificity breast cancer diagnosis .</detailed_description>
