	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sometimes prostate tumour may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . Radical treatment , radical prostatectomy radiation therapy , may effective treat prostate cancer first diagnose . It yet know whether active surveillance effective radical treatment initial intervention favorable prognosis prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study active surveillance see well work compare radical treatment initial intervention patient favorable prognosis prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare disease-specific survival patient favorable risk prostate cancer treat radical prostatectomy radical radiotherapy time initial diagnosis v active surveillance selective intervention base pre-specified biochemical , histological , clinical progression criterion . Secondary - To compare overall survival , quality life use EPIC-26 , RAND SF-12 , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , distant disease-free survival , PSA relapse/progression radical intervention , initiation androgen deprivation therapy two treatment arm . - To determine proportion patient active surveillance arm receive radical intervention prostate cancer . - To determine PSA doubling-time prior diagnosis predict eventual outcome . - To determine molecular biomarkers predict outcome . OUTLINE : This prospective , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify treatment center , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) , disease stage ( T1 v T2 ) , baseline PSA value ( ng/mL μg/L ) ( &lt; 5.0 v ≥ 5.0 ≤ 10.0 ) , age ( &lt; 65 year vs ≥ 65 year ) . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo radical intervention ( radical prostatectomy radiotherapy [ external-beam radiotherapy 5 day week 4-8 week ; permanent prostate brachytherapy ; high-dose rate temporary brachytherapy ] , base patient physician preference ) . - Arm II : Patients undergo active surveillance radical intervention time one pre-specified criterion ( biochemical progression , histologic/grade progression , and/or clinical progression ) meet . Quality life assess EPIC-26 , RAND SF-12 , State Anxiety Inventory baseline , periodically study treatment , completion radical treatment . After completion radical treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
