	<brief_title>Sirolimus Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine proportion patient previously treat advanced pancreatic cancer survive 6 month treatment single agent rapamycin . - To evaluate relationship activation PI3/Akt/mTOR/S6K signal pathway tumor tissue rapamycin activity patient population . - To characterize toxicity rapamycin patient population . Secondary - To determine response rate , median time treatment failure , median survival patient previously treat advanced pancreatic cancer treat single agent rapamycin . - To characterize pharmacokinetics rapamycin patient population . - To explore pharmacogenomic variable affect rapamycin pharmacokinetics clinical activity patient population . - To determine pharmacodynamic effect rapamycin S6 kinase activation PBMC , normal skin , normal oral mucosa obtain patient treated drug relationship rapamycin pharmacokinetics clinical effect . - To explore biomarkers tumor tissue might associate rapamycin clinical effect . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sirolimus daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood , normal skin , tumor tissue collection baseline periodically study pharmacological , biological , genotyping study . Blood sample analyze LC/MS/MS assay assess rapamycin pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) course 1 2 determine baseline CYP3A4 activity . Samples also analyze genotyping study assess CYP3A4 polymorphism . Pharmacodynamic activity rapamycin assess peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate PK blood sample use kinase assay measure S6K activity . Tumor tissue collect pretreatment tumor sample obtain time diagnosis surgery biopsy patient pre-study tumor specimen available . Patients undergo skin biopsy baseline day 1 course 2 obtain sample normal skin . Patients also undergo oral mucosa smear baseline weekly course 1 . Tumor tissue , normal skin , oral mucosa sample assess IHC stain S6K p-S6K RT-PCR cyclin D1 p27 .</detailed_description>
