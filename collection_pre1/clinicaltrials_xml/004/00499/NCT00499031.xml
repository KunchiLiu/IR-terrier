	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study cetuximab see well work treat patient persistent recurrent cervical cancer . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity cetuximab patient persistent recurrent carcinoma cervix . II . To determine frequency patient survive progression-free least 6 month initiate therapy objective tumor response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize distribution progression-free survival overall survival . II . To determine effect cetuximab duration objective response persistent recurrent carcinoma cervix . III . To determine nature degree toxicity cetuximab assess CTCAE v3.0 cohort patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab IV 120 minute day 1 . Courses repeat weekly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow ( physical exam history ) every three month first two year every six month next three year .</detailed_description>
