	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , satraplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving satraplatin together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well give satraplatin together bevacizumab work treat patient metastatic prostate cancer previously treat docetaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Satraplatin Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine time progression patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer previously treat docetaxel currently treat satraplatin bevacizumab . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Assess prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Assess change level N-terminal collagen peptide ( NTX ) bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) patient treat regimen . - Correlate urine NTX serum BSAP level time progression patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral satraplatin day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28-42 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
