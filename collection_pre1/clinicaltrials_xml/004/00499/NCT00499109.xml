	<brief_summary>This clinical research study evaluate chemotherapy experimental arm ( E ) result well outcome compare patient standard care arm ( C ) . 2:1 randomization experimental arm ( E ) standard arm ( C ) . In arm E , treatment dual-agent chemotherapy select base RRM1 ERCC1 expression protein level . In arm C , treatment dual-agent chemotherapy gemcitabine/carboplatin , i.e. , standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III RRM1 &amp; ERCC1 Directed Customized Chemotherapy Treatment Patients With NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before cycle , blood test , vital sign , interim medical history , physical exam perform . Patients carefully check immediate intervention initiate adverse event ( i.e . hypersensitivity ) occur . The last treatment cycle accord study cycle # 6 , early cycle . Certain test do within 28 day last drug infusion . These include physical exam , vital sign , temperature , weight , adverse event evaluation , image study , blood work . The study doctor see participant every 6 8 week least 12 month start treatment . After , participant follow every 3 month additional 24 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , large cell carcinoma , NSCLC otherwise specify . Patients suspect NSCLC may enroll prior diagnostic biopsy order obtain diagnostic molecular analysisrequired specimen procedure . Must blood work within 30 day prior biopsy eliminate unnecessary biopsy patient qualify ( screen failure ) due laboratory value meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . If patient blood work obtain outside facility , utilized preliminary assessment prior biopsy , final inclusion/exclusion value must obtain within 14 day start treatment . Willing undergo biopsy enable customization chemotherapy Stage IV IIIB ( malignant pleural effusion ) NSCLC Measurable evaluable disease Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Performance status 0 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) criteria Adequate bone marrow function evidence follow ( assess within 14 day start treatment ) : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mm³ , Platelet count &gt; = 100,000/mm³ , Hemoglobin &gt; = 8.0 gm/dL Prothrombin time ( PT ) activate prothrombin time thromboplastin kaolin ( APTT ) within normal laboratory range Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) assess within 14 day start treatment Adequate liver function evidence follow ( assess within 14 day start treatment ) : Total bilirubin must within normal limit ; aspartic transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; = 2.5 x ULN normal alkaline phosphatase ; alkaline phosphatases &lt; = 4 x upper limit normal normal AST ALT ; patient elevation alk phos AST and/or ALT exclude Serum calcium &lt; = 1.1 x ULN Signed informed consent document Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . Men partner childbearing age group woman childbearing potential must use effective contraception treatment 6 month thereafter . Previous surgery NSCLC ( 30 day study entry ) Previous radiotherapy ( RT ) allow : time completion RT initiation chemotherapy least 7 day ; patient fully recover toxic effect ; least one target lesion evaluable disease outside radiation field Previous chemotherapy allow last dose administer equal great 12 month ago . This chemotherapy must give adjuvant neoadjuvant mode prior complete surgical resection ( R0 resection ) NSCLC . Patients stable brain metastasis allow enroll . Stable brain metastasis define progression brain metastases 28 day conclusion definitive treatment document computed tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . Patients incidentally discover asymptomatic brain metastasis may enrol treated chemotherapy without prior brain irradiation deem feasible treat physician .
