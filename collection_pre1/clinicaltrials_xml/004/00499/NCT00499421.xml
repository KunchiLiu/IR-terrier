	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study evaluate system localize ( target treatment ) prostate external beam radiation therapy . The system use locate prostate treatment measure movement prostate treatment . The data collect system compare CT image take course radiation therapy treatment . Researchers try use information verify performance system , could lead improved position track prostate treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Intraprostatic Fiducial Markers For External Beam Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prostate may change position day-to-day basis due difference position , muscle tone , rectal filling , bladder filling . Soft tissue like prostate usually visible normal x-ray , certain metal like gold visible . Many institution use FDA-approved system ( fiducial system ) , one use study , involve implant small gold marker locate prostate daily basis . This system allow prostate locate treatment , may improve radiation delivery prostate decrease radiation exposure normal tissue rectum bladder . The ability system provide information location prostate treatment allow precise accurate radiation treatment prostate cancer . The small implanted gold marker 3 mm long 1 mm wide ( size grain rice ) . If agree take part study , 3 marker permanently implant prostate use needle similar biopsy needle use diagnose cancer . Treatment prostate cancer research study different MD Anderson standard care . You intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) treatment prostate cancer perform use CT-Linac treatment machine ( ExaCT , Varian Medical Systems , Palo Alto , CA ) . This machine IMRT capabilities treatment machine Radiation Oncology Department . During study , position gold marker see x-ray used make adjustment position prostate radiation therapy treatment . The position report fiducial system record used daily treatment . Three ( 3 ) time per week , CT scan prostate . The CT scan perform delivery radiation . Radiotherapists assist onto treatment table position treatment . The treatment table rotate 180 degree treatment machine CT scan prostate perform . After CT scan , take 5-8 minute , couch rotate back original position . A trans-abdominal ultrasound prostate also perform twice per week first two week week study . The MD Anderson staff researcher analyze change prostate movement radiation therapy use scan CT image ultrasound image compare positional change display fiducial-based system . Targeting prostate daily basis perform use fiducial-based system . This involve perform pair x-rays treatment . A shift make need use implanted prostate marker . The position seed shift routinely verify another pair x-ray . After alignment occur , radiation treatment deliver . This investigational study . The fiducial-based system FDA-approved . A total 20 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients pathologic diagnosis prostate cancer . 2 . Patients must plan external beam radiation definitive treatment prostate cancer daily localization . 3 . Patients must able tolerate transrectal transperineal implantation three fiducial marker prostate . 4 . Patients must able tolerate frequent ( e.g . three CT scan per week ) CT scan . 5 . Patients must able lie flat still duration fiducialbased localization CT scanning session . 6 . Patients must anatomy allow adequate pelvic image portal image CT scan . 7 . If patient receive hormone therapy , must start 8 week prior implantation fiducials . 8 . Patients hormonal therapy time simulation must remain hormone therapy radiation course complete . 9 . Patients must understand sign inform consent . 1 . Patients candidate transrectal prostate biopsy tolerate placement three fiducial prostate marker . 2 . Patients estimated prostate volume le 20 cc . 3 . Patients prior prostate surgery plan prostate surgery prostate cancer . 4 . Patients previous radiation therapy pelvis . 5 . Patients prior prostate brachytherapy implant plan course therapy use prostate brachytherapy ( permanent seed high dose rate ) . 6 . Patients body habitus CT bore CT/Linac treatment machine accommodate ( i.e . height great 6 ' 3 '' body weight great 300 pound ) . 7 . Patients anticoagulant medication ( e.g. , coumadin , clopidogrel , lowmolecular weight heparin ) aspirin eligible . Patients aspirin discontinue aspirin 7 day prior fiducial placement 5 day afterward . 8 . Patients hip prosthesis eligible .</criteria>
