	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Oxidized glutathione ( NOV-002 ) may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Giving NOV-002 together chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give oxidize glutathione ( NOV-002 ) together doxorubicin cyclophosphamide follow docetaxel work treat woman newly diagnose stage II stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - The primary objective study define rate pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) affect breast preoperative administration NOV-002 combination doxorubicin cyclophosphamide follow docetaxel patient stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer . Secondary - Define safety profile preoperative administration NOV-002 combination doxorubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide follow docetaxel . - Correlate serum protein glutathionylation clinical pathologic response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oxidize glutathione ( NOV-002 ) IV twice day -1 course 1 day 1 course 2-8 . Patients receive NOV-002 subcutaneously daily day 2-21 course 1-8 . Patients also receive chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 course 1-4 follow docetaxel IV day 1 course 5-8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo definitive surgery 3-6 week completion neoadjuvant therapy . Blood sample obtain baseline periodically study measure serum plasma protein glutathionlylation . Additional blood sample collect patient immunological correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
