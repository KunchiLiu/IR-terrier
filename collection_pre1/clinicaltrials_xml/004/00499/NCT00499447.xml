	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiofrequency ablation use high-frequency electric current kill tumor cell . External-beam radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiofrequency ablation together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give radiofrequency ablation together external-beam radiation therapy work treat patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine progession free survivial rate patient inoperable stage IA select stage IB non-small cell lung cancer treat external-beam radiation therapy radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . Secondary - To determine acute late toxicity combine RFA external-beam radiation therapy . - To determine pattern failure time first relapse . - To determine rate overall survival 1 2 year treatment . - To evaluate ability peak standard uptake value ( SUV ) max SUV obtain prior RFA predict local control time progression . - To measure post RFA/simulation ( treatment planning ) PET max peak SUV 's correlate data local control 1 2 year . - To evaluate ability peak max SUV 's fludeoxyglucose F 18 obtain shortly radiotherapy ( post-treatment ) predict local control time progression . - To evaluate PET-CT data utility guiding radiation therapy treatment planning . - To explore use dual time point image PET data obtain predict local control also differentiate recurrence versus inflammation applicable . - To assess physical function prognostic measure , determine impact treatment physical function . - To evaluate impact treatment generic disease-specific quality life . OUTLINE : Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) CT scan baseline . Patients undergo radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . Beginning within 5 week completion RFA , patient undergo external-beam radiation therapy daily , 5 day week , 5-6 week . FDG-PET/CT scan repeat 3-4 week RFA 12-16 week completion external-beam radiation therapy . Quality life assess baseline , treatment , 16 week 1 year completion treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
