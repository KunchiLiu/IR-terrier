	<detailed_description>Infection hepatitis-C virus ( HCV ) people live HIV/AIDS ( PLHA ) progressively gain distinction since survival increase generate use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) enable presentation complication HCV chronic infection . There approximately 10 million coinfected individual , , 25 % total PLHA virus share transmission route . HCV infection regard opportunistic disease population acceleration natural history represent HCV high viral load , early hepatic fibrosis great occurrence steatosis , cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma , lead great morbid-mortality terminal hepatic disease . The scenario also favorable regard HCV treatment , since response rate coinfected individual significantly low mono-infected HCV patient . The complex relationship immune response HCV determine velocity distinct outcomes find . The major determinant development cirrhosis hepatic insufficiency accumulation fibrosis inflammatory activity closely related collagen synthesis fibroblasts hepatocyte-apoptosis induction relate TGF-β production . In individual severe hepatic lesion , prevalence expression Th-2 profile peripheral blood , characterize high level IL-4 IL-10 , whereas , hepatic tissue , large expression cytokine Th-1 profile , IL-2 INF-γ , observe . This phenomenon know `` compartmentalization '' immune response . If immunopathogenic dynamic already complex HCV mono-infected individual , HIV/HCV coinfection condition , study specifically approach topic , without , however , evaluate correlation specific T-cell response hepatic-lesion staging . In HIV mono-infected patient without antiretroviral treatment disease progression , prevalence Th-0/Th-2 profile observe , particularly influence IL-10 increase . Even individual treat HAART , recovery capacity express Th-1 profile , patient show mature Th-0 profile low IL-2 level . HCV viral load PLHA high plasma hepatic tissue , replication HCV macrophage , CD4 CD8 T lymphocytes well lymphnodes also observe condition . TGF-β particularly high coinfection , thus justify onset fast fibrosis . The reduction CD8 T lymphocyte response IFN-γ also occur , favor persistence infection prevents specific T-cell response . As regard HIV treatment , evidence coinfected patient non-treated HAART tend present Th-2 profile often treated individual , without , however , significant difference TGF-β level . Due lack study correlate production tendency pro-inflammatory fibrogenesis-inducing cytokine histopathological finding hepatic biopsy coinfected individual , investigation necessary order establish parameter allow prediction well bad prognosis also accurately indicate performance hepatic biopsy . This study aim correlate TNF-α , INF-γ , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-10 TGF-β value dose ELISA mRNA expression real-time PCR histopathological hepatic biopsy finding individual HIV/HCV coinfection . This population divide three group ( G1 : HAART ; G2 : detect HIV viral load ( HIV VL ) ; G3 : undetected HIV VL ) , compare two control group monoinfection HIV HCV , addition third control group comprise normal blood donor .</detailed_description>
