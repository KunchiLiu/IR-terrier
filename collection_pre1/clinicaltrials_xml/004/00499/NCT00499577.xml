	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer cell stop blood flow cancer . A stem cell transplant use stem cell patient may able replace immune cell destroy chemotherapy use kill cancer cell . Giving infusion donor 's T cell transplant may help destroy remain cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect stem cell transplant give together chemotherapy biological therapy see well work treat patient high-risk refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety combination immunotherapy use activate T-cells hTERT/survivin multipeptide vaccine post-autotransplant ( autologous stem cell transplantation ) set whether delay hematopoietic recovery induces autoimmune event . - To determine whether strategy infuse vaccine-primed T-cells early transplant conjunction post-transplant booster immunization lead induction cellular immune response putative tumor antigen hTERT ( catalytic subunit telomerase ) survivin . - To determine combination immunotherapy deliver arm I patient increase frequency delay paraprotein responses 60 day 6 month post-transplant , sufficient upgrade maximal level myeloma response , compare non-vaccinated ( arm II ) patient . Secondary - To determine adoptive transfer hTERT/survivin-primed T-cells conjunction multi-peptide booster immunization generate cytotoxic T-cell response autologous myeloma cell vivo . - To evaluate myeloma clinical response include frequency complete partial response 1 &amp; 2-year event-free overall survival . - To measure antibody responses 4 7 serotypes contain pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine well T-cell response CRM-197 carrier protein CMV peptide antigen . - To evaluate level hTERT survivin expression patient myeloma cell . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord HLA-A2 status ( positive v negative ) . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group base stratification . - Immunization 1 : - Group 1 ( HLA-A2 positive ) : Patients receive follow peptide emulsify incomplete Freund 's adjuvant VG : I ) hTERT I540 peptide ; ii ) hTERT R572Y peptide ; iii ) hTERT D988Y peptide ; iv ) survivin Sur1M2 peptide ; v ) CMV control peptide N495 subcutaneously ( SC ) . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) intramuscularly ( IM ) . - Group 2 : Patients receive PCV vaccine IM GM-CSF SC . - Steady-state T-cell harvesting : About 10 day ( range 7-14 ) immunization # 1 , patient undergo mononuclear cell apheresis procedure collect steady-state T-cells cryopreserved later expansion . - Stem cell mobilization : After completion mononuclear cell apheresis procedure , patient offer DT-PACE chemotherapy cytoreduction stem cell mobilization . This regimen follow : dexamethasone daily 4 day ; thalidomide daily 4 day ; cisplatin IV continuously 4 day ( patient serum creatinine level ≥ 2.0 mg/dL receive cisplatin ) ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously 4 day ; cyclophosphamide IV continuously 4 day ; etoposide IV continuously 4 day . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) SC daily start day completion chemotherapy . An acceptable alternative stem cell mobilization use cyclophosphamide IV 12 hour , patient require outpatient stem cell mobilization procedure perform , cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour . The cyclophosphamide mobilization regimen use patient already receive DTPACE part pre-transplant therapy . - High-dose therapy : High-dose therapy consist melphalan IV 20 minute day -1 . Autologous stem cell infusion take place day 0 , least 18 hour administration high-dose melphalan . Stem cell infuse IV 20-60 minute . G-CSF SC administer begin day +5 . - Autologous T-cell expansion infusion : Cryopreserved cell expand ex vivo 12 day prepared infusion day 2 post-transplant . - Infusion autologous T-cells : The costimulated ( `` activate '' ) T-cells infused 20-60 minute day +2 transplant . - Immunizations 2 , 3 , 4 : - Group 1 : On day 14 , 42 , 90 post-transplant , patient receive peptide , PCV , GM-CSF group I immunization # 1 . - Group 2 : On day 14 , 42 , 90 post-transplant , patient receive PCV GM-CSF group II immunization # 1 . - Maintenance therapy : At day 180 post-transplant , completion post-transplant immunological assessment , patient receive low-dose thalidomide absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect T-cell harvest day 14 , 60 , 100 , 180 post-transplant . Samples analyze quantitative CD3/CD4/CD8 study , cellular immunoassay , antibody immunoassay , gene expression . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
