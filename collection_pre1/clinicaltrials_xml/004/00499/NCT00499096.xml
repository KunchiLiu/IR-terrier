	<detailed_description>Background : Bipolar disorder associate significant personal societal cost , represent substantial burden VA. Medical condition , notably cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , substantial contributor increase morbidity mortality patient bipolar disorder , part behavioral treatment factor . Despite existence effective medication manage CVD-related risk factor ( e.g. , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , obesity ) , outcomes condition remain suboptimal among patient bipolar disorder . Objectives : The immediate objective study determine whether manual-based Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) intervention compare usual VA care improve control intermediate physiological measure represent risk factor CVD veteran bipolar disorder . We hypothesize , within 12 month intervention initiation , patient receive CCM intervention likely demonstrate improve control CVD-related risk factor ( blood pressure , fast cholesterol ) report improve physical health-related quality life . Methods : This prospective , randomize , control , single-blind , single-site behavioral intervention trial adult patient diagnosis bipolar disorder receive care VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System . Up 300 subject enrol , 150 randomize receive intervention 150 receive usual VA care . All subject complete baseline clinical assessment subsequent follow-up assessment 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month . The intervention 's three core component implement nurse Care Manager include : 1 ) self-management behavioral session patient address reduction CVD risk factor symptom control behavior change base Social Cognitive Theory , 2 ) care management promote patient behavior change coordinate care , 3 ) implementation practice guideline provider management CVD risk factor patient bipolar disorder . Medical psychiatric care , include medication , continue provide patient 's usual provider . Usual VA care enhance consist guideline implementation general patient education ( attention control ) , include self-management session Care Manager contact . Primary clinical outcome include change cholesterol , health-related quality life ( SF-12 physical health summary score ) . Linear regression model use determine effect intervention outcome . Mediators treatment effect include symptom health behavior also assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis bipolar disorder ( I , II , otherwise specify , schizoaffectivebipolar subtype ) Have diagnosis risk arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) . We define patient current diagnosis receive treatment least one follow medical condition : hyperlipidemia dyslipidemia ( documented diagnosis lowdensity lipoprotein &gt; =160 , receive statin treatment ) hypertension ( document diagnosis blood pressure &gt; =140/90 2 occasion ) diabetes mellitus ( documented diagnosis HbA1C &gt; =7 % , receive treatment ) obesity ( documented diagnosis BMI &gt; 30 ) , base medical record review current problem current ASCVD diagnosis Have unresolved substance intoxication withdrawal , appear intoxicate ( e.g. , incoherent , slur speech ) , experience withdrawal symptom substance abuse time enrollment . Are already enrol mental health program mobile outreach component clinical caregiver deliver service patient community ( e.g. , assertive community treatment intensive case management ) . These patient may receive similar service offer intervention . Are unwilling unable provide inform consent comply study requirement time enrollment ( e.g. , unable complete form attend schedule session due serious illness substantial functional limitation ) .</criteria>
