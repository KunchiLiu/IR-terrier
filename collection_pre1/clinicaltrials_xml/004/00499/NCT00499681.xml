	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving letrozole together lapatinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give letrozole together lapatinib work treat postmenopausal woman stage I , stage II , stage III breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine pathological complete response patient HER2-positive hormone receptor-positive operable stage I-III breast cancer . Secondary - To determine tumor cell apoptosis situ measure TUNEL analysis tumor section fresh frozen paraffin-embedded core biopsy . ( Parts 1 2 ) - To determine whether EGFR , P-EGFR , P-HER2 , Ser118 P-ERα , P-Akt , P-MAPK ( IHC use fresh frozen paraffin-embedded core biopsy ) predict inhibition proliferation situ ( Ki67 ) and/or induction cell death ( TUNEL ) . ( Parts 1 2 ) - To determine safety profile neoadjuvant letrozole lapatinib . ( Part 2 ) - To evaluate tumor response treatment measure ultrasound . ( Part 2 ) - To evaluate rate breast conservation surgery . ( Part 2 ) - To determine inhibition cell proliferation situ response letrozole lapatinib measure change percentage Ki67-positive tumor cell ( determine IHC use tumor section fresh frozen paraffin-embedded surgical material ) . ( Part 2 ) OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two-part study . - Part 1 : Patients randomize treatment arm . - Patients receive lapatinib letrozole daily 2 week . - Patients receive letrozole placebo daily 2 week . Patients proceed part 2 . - Part 2 : All patient receive lapatinib letrozole daily 14 week . Patients undergo surgical resection disease . Patients undergo tissue sample collection baseline , 2 week , time surgery biomarker laboratory study . Samples analyze IHC TUNEL .</detailed_description>
