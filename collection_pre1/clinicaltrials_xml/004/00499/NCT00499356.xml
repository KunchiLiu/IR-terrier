	<brief_summary>We evaluate feasibility GlideSoft™ novel insole reduce pressure shear force foot . No commercially available insole design reduce shear . Although insurance provider spend million diabetic ’ therapeutic insole , scientific data shear pressure reduction . We evaluate optimal bond material Phase I compare Glidesoft™ design use combination viscoelastic material . We evaluate 2 patient group 150 patient per arm ( 300 total ) 18 month trial . The control group patient arm wear traditional bonded insole whereas another second arm receive GlideSoft™ . At baseline , end 18 month trial , in-shoe gait lab vitro biomechanical parameter measure pressure , shear , material property change wear . This Phase II eighteen ( 18 ) month clinical trial evaluate effectiveness ShearSole™ reduce incidence diabetic ulcer . The overall study hypothesis GlideSoft™ provide significant shear reduction compare traditional insole without sacrifice pressure reduction characteristic durability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . To evaluate efficacy shear reduce shoe insole ( GlideSoft ) reduce incidence diabetic foot pathology among high-risk patient . We study effectiveness shear reduce shoe insole prevent foot ulcer high-risk diabetic sensory neuropathy , history foot ulcer history partial foot amputation . The study comprise two treatment arm . The first group receive standard therapy involve standard therapeutic shoe insole , patient education regular foot evaluation physician . The second group receive standard therapy , instead standard insole patient use GlideSoft - novel shear reduce insole . As determined Phase I study , GlideSoft dramatically reduce shear force compare standard insole , perform equally well reduce compressive force . Patients follow 18 month . The primary study outcome incident foot ulcer . Our hypothesis patient use GlideSoft few ulcer ulcer less severe compare patient evaluated Standard Insole Group . 2 . To evaluate change pressure shear reduce capability two . To evaluate change pressure shear reduce capability GlideSoft standard insole duration use . We measure in-shoe pressure in-vitro shear force foot-insole interface begin study patient wear insole four month one “ standard cycle wear ” . We use Novel Electronics , Inc. Pedar in-shoe pressure system measure interface foot insole Shear Force Tester ( see Phase I report ) evaluate shear force . We expect GlideSoft would significantly reduce shear force provide equivalent reduction vertical force day 0 evaluation day 120 evaluation . 3 . To evaluate patient perceive benefit , satisfaction , compliance 2 . To evaluate change pressure shear reduce capability GlideSoft standard insole duration use . We measure in-shoe pressure in-vitro shear force foot-insole interface begin study patient wear insole four month one “ standard cycle wear ” . We use Novel Electronics , Inc. Pedar in-shoe pressure system measure interface foot insole Shear Force Tester ( see Phase I report ) evaluate shear force . We expect GlideSoft would significantly reduce shear force provide equivalent reduction vertical force day 0 evaluation day 120 evaluation .</detailed_description>
