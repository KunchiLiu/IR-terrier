	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) inherit disorder mucus-secreting gland lung produce considerable quantity thick , sticky secretion clog airway , promote bacterial growth lead chronic obstruction , inflammation destruction airway . The purpose study collect data resolution chronic inflammatory state addition assure safety therapy CF patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Safety Efficacy Inhaled Alpha-1 Antitrypsin ( AAT ) Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In CF patient unregulated inflammatory response overwhelms normal protease ( elastase ) /antiprotease ( AAT ) balance , lead accumulation elastase lung , destruction lung architecture , severe pulmonary dysfunction , ultimately death . Administration AAT address elastase/antiprotease imbalance order prevent destruction lung tissue reduce inflammatory dysregulation cause pulmonary dysfunction .</detailed_description>
