	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving paclitaxel together sorafenib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well paclitaxel work give together without sorafenib treat patient locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2b Study Taxol Plus Sorafenib Placebo Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival patient locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer treat sorafenib tosylate paclitaxel versus placebo paclitaxel first-line therapy . Secondary - Compare objective response rate duration response patient treat regimen . - Compare time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare survival patient treat regimen . - Compare safety patient treat regimen . - Compare change baseline Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Breast Cancer quality life assessment score patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This double-blind , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord site metastatic disease ( visceral [ i.e. , soft internal organ body , include lung , heart , organ digestive , excretory , reproductive system ] vs nonvisceral [ i.e. , osseous soft tissue ] sit ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 3 week . Patients also receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . - Arm II : Patients receive paclitaxel arm I oral placebo twice daily day 1-28 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , every 8 week 24 week , every 12 week duration study participation . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 4 month .</detailed_description>
