	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study give irinotecan cetuximab together bevacizumab see well work compare give irinotecan cetuximab alone treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer progress first-line therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether irinotecan cetuximab effective without bevacizumab treat metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Cetuximab With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Progressed During First-Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare progression-free survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer progress first-line therapy comprise bevacizumab FOLFOX , OPTIMOX , XELOX treat irinotecan hydrochloride-based chemotherapy cetuximab v without bevacizumab . II . Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . III . Compare objective tumor response ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) patient measurable disease treat regimen . IV . Compare tolerability safety profile regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord Zubrod performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) , discontinuation oxaliplatin first-line therapy ( yes v ) , plan concurrent chemotherapy ( FOLFIRI vs single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride ) , time last dose bevacizumab ( 14-42 day vs &gt; = 43 day ) . All patient receive 1 follow chemotherapy regimen : SINGLE AGENT IRINOTECAN HYDROCHLORIDE : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . FOLFIRI : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride FOLFIRI outline cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 14-21 day ( depend upon chemotherapy regimen ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride FOLFIRI outline cetuximab arm I . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14-21 day ( depend upon chemotherapy regimen ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III ( close accrual 4/20/2009 ) : Patients receive single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride FOLFIRI outline cetuximab arm I . Patients also receive high dose bevacizumab ( high arm II ) IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14-21 day ( depend upon chemotherapy regimen ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year year 3 year .</detailed_description>
