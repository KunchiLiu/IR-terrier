	<brief_summary>Critically ill child , include child undergoing heart surgery , commonly develop elevated blood glucose ( also know `` blood sugar '' ) level illness , lead poor health outcome increase risk death . This study examine effectiveness maintain normal blood glucose level decrease infection improve recovery young child undergo heart surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children undergoing heart surgery significant bodily stress , lead high normal low normal blood glucose level . A synthetic form insulin , naturally occur hormone body , injected people normalize blood glucose level . Insulin commonly use treat people diabetes , also use hospital control blood glucose level patient . Previous study adult intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient show patient whose blood sugar level maintain normal level use insulin contract few infection release quickly ICU patient maintain normal blood glucose level . This study use continuous blood glucose monitoring system detect change blood glucose level . Intravenous insulin infusion use safely maintain normal blood glucose level . The purpose study determine maintain normal blood glucose level ICU stay help decrease incidence infection improve surgical recovery young child follow heart surgery . This study enroll child undergo heart surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass procedure . Participants randomly assign either control group treatment group . All participant receive usual care ICU undergo continuous glucose monitoring . Participants treatment group receive intravenous insulin infusion keep blood glucose within normal range . While ICU , blood collect participant day first 3 day week monitor glucose level , hormone level , measurement nutrition immune function . On day 1 5 follow surgery , participant ventilator breath measure monitor heart function energy use . Thirty day 1 year follow surgery , study researcher contact participant 's parent doctor collect information health status new infection surgical site . Children enroll study ask participate follow-up neurodevelopmental evaluation 1 3 year age assess long term cognitive effect tight glycemic control ICU .</detailed_description>
