	<brief_summary>Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) lead genetic cause death infancy . It devastate disease lead progressive loss nerve cell control muscle bulk movement . Patients develop increase weakness muscle , eventually include need breathing . In half patient , SMA start infancy typically lead death within first 2 year life . In others , disease begin childhood lead significant disability . SMA cause defect `` Survival Motor Neurons '' ( SMN1 ) gene . Researchers hopeful find cure , nature provide human second gene , almost identical copy SMN1 gene . Normally , second gene contribute much , researcher think function increase medication . To find whether medication help patient SMA , conduct clinical trial . Here , propose prepare clinical trial . We invite SMA patient join research effort . We examine regularly well understand disease . The visit include question , physical exam , blood drawing , sometimes X-rays skin biopsy . We use modern computer method process information . While , plan clinical trial . Once clinical trial begin , offer SMA patient participation meet criterion trial . We make sure participant ' privacy maintain study risk low possible . Identifying effective SMA treatment important currently none . Clinical trial way decide whether new treatment work SMA patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) one devastate neurological disease childhood . Affected infant child suffer progressive muscle weakness cause degeneration lower motor neuron spinal cord brainstem . Clinically , four phenotype distinguish within continuous spectrum disease severity base age onset high motor milestone ever achieve . SMA cause homozygous deletion survival motor neuron-1 ( SMN1 ) gene . A related gene , SMN2 , produce low level full-length SMN protein due inefficient splice . There inverse correlation SMN copy number disease severity , presumably mediate level full length SMN protein . Therefore , increase amount full-length SMN protein promise treatment strategy . Several drug target splice efficiency result increased SMN protein preclinical assay await clinical testing . With future objective conduct clinical trial SMA , propose project 3 specific aim : 1 ) To establish web-based database serve enroll patient population facilitate timely recruitment future clinical trial ; ( 2 ) plan clinical trial ) develop reliable outcome measure , ( b ) establish infrastructure need carry efficient clinical trial , ( c ) convene meeting preclinical clinical researcher involve SMA drug development select candidate drug , ( 3 ) characterize patient population clinical molecular point view . We establish Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research Network ( PNCR ) evaluate patient three site : New York , Boston Philadelphia . Data management ( include fully web-based data repository ) statistical analysis carry University Rochester `` Muscle Study Group Data Center '' , group experience clinical trial neuromuscular disease . We characterize patient population use select outcome measure , standardize among site . The clinical trial planning phase focus develop necessary infrastructure site , critically evaluate candidate outcome measure , obtain pilot data use outcome measure , establish reliability . In parallel propose study work closely preclinical unit Columbia University SMA research center identify prioritize candidate drug future clinical trial . Finally , base observational data propose study , discussion among network 's clinical expert develop efficient phase I/II clinical trial design test candidate drug . This clinical research timely relevant , laboratory research identify candidate drug SMA . There currently effective treatment devastate disease . All activity Network conform establish regulation govern clinical research patient privacy ( HIPAA ) .</detailed_description>
