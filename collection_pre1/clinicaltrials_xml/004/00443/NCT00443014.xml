	<detailed_description>Nine municipalities 11807 inhabitant 65 year older allocate intervention control , five four municipality group , respectively . A panel psychiatric nurse , university lecturer member competence centre dementia Northern Norway work program stimulation therapy adjust participant take stage functional impairment , education level work experience consideration . The individual stimulation program select implement , base life history patient , carry minimum 30 minute 5 day week intervention group , compare control group receive routine care . The individual stimulation program monitor adjusted period intervention . All patient include nine municipality randomize donepezil placebo double blind manner . Consequently , present study double design ; - open prospective non-pharmaceutical intervention control group , double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial superimpose ( 2x2 factorial design ) . Each patient followed-up one year . The clinical period three year , two allocate recruitment third secure one-year intervention participant . The Progress Study The recruitment patient routine general practice successful . The participate general practitioner ( GP ) rarely examine patient suffer cognitive impairment . Sometimes patient presumptive diagnosis dementia prescribe cholinesterase inhibitor ( ChEI ) without precede clinical examination . As result lack corporation 27 patient recruit study first year . During subsequent six month nine participate municipality reorganize care routine patient suffer dementia . More patient examine diagnosed another 60 patient recruit study . As consequence unsatisfactory progress recruit patient study GPs routine clinical practice , study protocol change recruiting procedure supplement population-based screening . The study population ( 65 years+ ) invite attend survey respond return postal questionnaire contain five simple question regard memory cognitive deficit . The screen program accomplish June 2007 response rate approximately 32 % self-reported memory deficit . An algorithm categorize responder . Those belong category high risk diagnosis dementia invite clinical examination carry physician study administration . Those fulfil inclusion criterion ask included Dementia Study Northern-Norway . More 700 responder answer NO five question cognitive impairment YES question participate study . From group presumptively cognitive healthy people randomly draw sample 500 person invited participate control group AD participant . Of 200 individual confirm cognitively healthy include control group . The two group compare accord clinical data , co-morbidity drug consumption . A biobank contain whole blood , plasma serum AD participant cognitively healthy control group establish . The stimulation program execute presuppose , randomisation procedure administration medical treatment ( placebo/donepezil ) accomplish without problem .
