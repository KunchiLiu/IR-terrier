	<detailed_description>1 . 0 Background Rationale : Despite use aggressive treatment protocol , le 10 % cancer patient advance disease respond therapy . There variety different cancer drug regimen , approximately probability clinical effectiveness . Identification patient respond specific chemotherapy important making decision regard chemotherapy regimen well alternative management approach . A laboratory test could help determine sensitivity individual patient 's tumor cell specific chemotherapeutic agent would valuable choose optimal chemotherapy regimen patient expectation increase response rate therapy . Several type vitro assay measure tumor cell survival follow exposure cytotoxic agent evaluate ability predict chemotherapy outcomes . As group , assays refer drug resistance assay . In resistance assay , survive tumor cell detect directly exclusion metabolism specific dye . Alternatively , since tumor cell proliferate , survival detect measurement DNA synthesis radiolabeled precursor incorporation demonstration clonogenic potential growth colony semi-solid culture medium . In several clinical study , assay useful detect drug resistance predict poor prognosis cancer patient . However , resistance assay detect sensitivity individual patient 's tumor cell specific drug . Therefore , new method determine drug-sensitivity tumor cell individual patient , thus , capable predict positive treatment outcome guide chemotherapy , would significant value . Recently , Dr. Kravtsov develop automated microculture kinetic ( MiCK ) assay measure drug induce apoptosis tumor cell . Apoptosis distinct mode cell death occur physiological condition yet induce malignant cell chemical physical factor include antitumor drug . During last decade , recognize chemotherapeutic agent exert antitumor activity trigger apoptosis susceptible tumor cell . This imply MiCK assay apoptosis provide mechanism-based approach study effect cytotoxic agent tumor cell . Unlike `` resistance '' assay measure fraction cell survive drug exposure , MiCK assay measure fraction tumor cell kill chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism apoptosis . Therefore MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity , rather resistance . Recently MiCK assay show predict complete remission rate survival acute myeloid leukemia patient well clinical criterion . In limited study , MiCK assay use direct chemotherapy leukemia patient . The MiCK assay also use study drug-induced apoptosis solid tumor , include neuroblastoma colon adenocarcinoma cell line . More recent data accumulate DiaTech demonstrate MiCK assay detect drug induce apoptosis primary culture tumor cell isolated patient ovarian carcinoma , gastric carcinoma , metastatic breast cancer high grade soft tissue sarcoma . Based data , suggest MiCK assay may use detect drug sensitivity profile individual patient various type solid tumor . This , turn , may provide way tailor chemotherapy individual patient 's drug sensitivity profile , , thus , improve treatment outcome , decrease adverse effect chemotherapy , increase quality patient 's life , reduce treatment cost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients pathological diagnosis ovarian , fallopian primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma . Patients de novo malignancy previous chemotherapy Patients advance refractory malignancy receive 2 standard chemotherapy treatment protocol . Patients age group . Patients must tumor accessible agree undergo biopsy , drainage effusion . Patients chemotherapy treatment option . Explanations : We anticipate newly diagnose patient mostly used evaluate ability MiCK assay predict outcome chemotherapy ( Objective # 2.1 ) establish criterion correlate numerical response MiCK assay probability clinically establish complete remission . The patient refractory malignancy mostly use evaluate ability MiCK assay guide cancer chemotherapy ( Objective # 2.2 ) . Patients see manage outpatient inpatient , depend clinical standard institution Patients symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchimal brain metastasis accessible tumor . Patients meningeal metastasis . Patients chemotherapy clinically indicate . Pregnancy . During course study , patient childbearing potential instruct contact treat physician suspect might conceive child ; female , miss late menstrual period report treating physician . If pregnancy confirm pregnancy test , patient must receive study medication must enrol study , already enrol , must withdraw study . If male patient suspect father child study drug , pregnant female partner must notify counsel regard risk fetus . Pregnancy course study report Principal Investigator serious adverse event . Women child bear potential define include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal ( define amenorrhea 12 consecutive month ) ; include also female use oral , implanted , injectable contraceptive hormone , mechanical device , barrier method prevent pregnancy .</criteria>
