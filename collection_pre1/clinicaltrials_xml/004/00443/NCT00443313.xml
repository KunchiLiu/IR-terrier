	<brief_summary>Background : - Cancer cervix ( bottom third uterus , womb ) prevent regular Pap test ( also call Pap smear ) , check change cell cervix . Because many woman United States regular Pap smear , cervical cancer common country . However , disease common among woman Mississippi Delta poor participation screen program . - The major cause cervical cancer persistent human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) infection cancer-associated HPV type lack screen . These virus cause infection often go away , go away , long time lead cervical cancer . HPV cause cervical abnormality , detect Pap smear treat . Objectives : -To determine whether at-home self-collection method obtain cell cervix simple , safe inexpensive way screen cervical cancer woman go health clinic regularly . Eligibility : - Women reside county Leflore , Sunflower , Washington Tallahatchie , Mississippi . - Women 26 65 year age pregnant hysterectomy . Design : Screening study participant undergo follow : - The doctor take cervical sample use self-collection device woman use home self-collect . - Pelvic examination Pap test . For test , woman lie exam table doctor insert instrument call speculum vagina , open see cervix . A special brush use take cell cervix . The cell place glass slide send lab examination . - Cervical cell specimen collection use at-home self-collection kit participant use home 2 week - At-home self-collection participant 2 week . - Referral doctor follow-up care , need . - Colposcopy ( see ) woman Pap test abnormal positive HPV woman normal smear . Colposcopy study participant undergo follow : - The doctor take cervical sample use self-collection device woman use home self-collect . - Colposcopy , exam doctor examines cervix use light look magnify device see abnormal tissue cervix . During exam , doctor may remove small sample tissue diagnose abnormality . Participants also sample collect use self-collection kit . - At-home cervical sample collection participant 2 week . - Notification medical care require treatment biopsy look abnormal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cytology screen program effectively reduce cervical cancer incidence mortality U.S. great 75 % . However , program require repeat clinician-administered Pap smear adequately cover medically-underserved population . Based partly HREB/DCEG etiologic research , know carcinogenic type human papillomavirus ( HPV ) cause virtually case cervical cancer . Supported translational work DCP , HPV DNA test already approve FDA adjunctive screening modality cytology country primary screen modality cytology country primary screen modality internationally . A validated screening program HPV DNA test self-collected cervicovaginal specimen would permit wide coverage screen cytology population underserved cytology-based testing like Mississippi Delta region . Objective : To assess technical feasibility ( i.e . non-inferiority equivalence cytology detection cervical precancer cancer ) cervical cancer screen base self-collection HPV DNA test cervicovaginal specimen woman age great equal 30 year old live Mississippi Delta . Methods : One thousand woman enrol 18 month , include 500 attend colposcopy due cytologic abnormality , 250 woman regularly attend screen clinic , 250 unscreened woman Pap smear within last 3 year ( accord current screening guideline ) recruit attend screening . Three clinical specimen collect woman . A cervicovaginal specimen ( HPV test ) cervical specimen ( cytology HPV test ) collect woman physician . At time clinic visit woman give kit self-collection second cervicovaginal specimen ( HPV test ) return mail within two week . All three specimen woman test two clinical DNA test use pooled-probes detection carcinogenic HPV : FDA-approved signal amplification test ( Hybrid Capture 2 Digene ) new DNA amplification test ( AMPLICOR Roche ) currently clinical trial . Specimens also test retrospectively research PCR asay detects 37 HPV type , help u evaluate performance two clinical HPV test . Women attend screen visit test positive cytology ( atypical squamous cell undetermined significance worse ) carcinogenic HPV refer colposcopy along random sample HPV negative , cytologic negative woman ( n equal 100 ) . Analysis : We compare clinical performance HPV DNA test self-collected specimen cytology ( threshold atypical squamous cell unknown significance ( ASCUS ) severe ) detection histologically confirm cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 ( CIN2 ) severe ( great equal CIN2 ) . Cytology result base standard-of-care cytology screen woman attend screen visit repeat cytology woman attend colposcopy . An estimated 150 case great equal CIN2 identify . This equivalence study , wish reject null hypothesis HPV self-testing great 10 % le sensitive cytology . Assuming cytology 75 % sensitivity great equal CIN2 , sample size 150 subject 84 % power ( alpha=0.05 ) ( one-sided non-inferiority equivalence test correlate proportion ) rule 10 % decrement sensitivity self-collection HPV DNA test compare cytology guide whether new technique could broadly introduce cervical cancer screening .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Fivehundred woman attend colposcopy 500 woman receive cytology screening , include 250 unscreened woman , recruit study . Nonpregnant , nonhysterectomized woman age 2665 recruited . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women 26 65 year age . Pregnant woman woman give birth child past 8 week . To insure woman include study pregnant , ask woman consent process pregnant . Women answer yes either query exclude . Participants also receive reminder call 2week selfcollection . At time , woman ask pregnant . If woman answer yes , instructed selfcollect . Women total hysterectomy . Women overt cancerous lesion visible upon exam clinician . Other reason exclude woman include inability speak English , appearance mental incompetence , refusal participate sign informed consent form .</criteria>
