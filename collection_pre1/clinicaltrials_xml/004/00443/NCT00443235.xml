	<brief_title>GEM05 Patients With Multiple Myeloma More Than 65 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 260 patient &gt; 65 year old diagnose Multiple Myeloma symptomatic disease receive previous chemotherapy MM include . Patients evaluate scheduled visit three study period : Pre-treatment , Treatment Follow . The Pre-treatment include Screening baseline visit . After provide informed consent , patient evaluate study eligibility Patients randomize one one receive Melphalan+Prednisone+Velcade ( Group A ) Thalidomide+Prednisone+Velcade ( Group B ) . All receive induction treatment 30 week . After 4 week , without progression unacceptable toxicity , Patients randomize one one receive maintenance treatment : Thalidomide+Velcade ( Group M1 ) Prednisone+Velcade ( Group M2 ) three year . Once treatment period finish follow carry . During period evaluate response , progression-free survival global survival every three month .</detailed_description>
