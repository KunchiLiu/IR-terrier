	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove SCCHN either metastatic persist recur follow definitive surgery and/or radiation therapy , amenable salvage surgical resection . Patients may receive previous chemotherapy and/or biological treatment ( cetuximab ) recurrent metastatic disease . Prior treatment must complete least 28 day ( 42 day nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study toxicity must resolve . Prior radiation must complete least 28 day entry study toxicity must resolve ( 3000 cGy field include substantial marrow ) . Surgery must complete least 28 day entry study complications/adverse event must resolve . Patients must least one lesion amenable serial biopsy . Age great 18 year . ECOG performance status less 2 ( Karnofsky great 60 % ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function Patients must plan receive concurrent therapy ( ie , radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biological therapy gene therapy ) SCCHN study . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior azacitidine treatment . Patients must plan receive concurrent therapy ( ie , radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biological therapy , investigational agent gene therapy ) SCCHN study . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition azacitidine , cisplatin mannitol agent use study . Pregnant nursing woman may participate trial increase risk fetal harm include fetal death chemotherapeutic agent . Women/men reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients know HIVpositive eligible potential confound study 's endpoint . No prior malignancy allow except adequately treat basal cell ( squamous cell ) skin cancer , situ cervical cancer cancer patient diseasefree five year .</criteria>
