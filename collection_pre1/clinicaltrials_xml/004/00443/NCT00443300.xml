	<brief_title>Effectiveness Protected Environment Rooms AML MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For AML high-risk MDS , common practice patient age 50 old receive initial treatment PE M. D. Anderson . The PE series room contain special air-flow system design filter germ cause serious infection . Patients stay PE room , without leave , 5 week . In attempt keep PE room germ-free , medical staff allow room . Family visitor see patient , separated patient glass wall . Each PE room laptop computer connect internet . Books , newspaper , various material allow PE room sterilize safety reason . Therapy give patient AML MDS recently change high ( usually mean possibility infection need hospitalization ) low intensity . Because value PE already establish patient receive higher-intensity therapy , researcher want learn value PE patient receive lower-intensity therapy . If agree take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance either one group . Participants one group place PE . Participants group place PE outpatient care . After first 30 participant assign one group , chance future participant assign PE depend result ( rate infection ) see early participant . If assign PE , stay PE 5 week begin standard treatment . You remove PE medical problem develop require receive treatment somewhere else hospital stay PE simply difficult ( claustrophobia [ fear close space ] feel `` home sickness '' [ strong desire physical contact family friends ] ) . If assign PE , ask stay Houston 5 week receive treatment outpatient basis , unless problem require hospitalization ( PE ) . You may choose assigned either group . If case , study doctor study staff ask participate study allow data ( information ) collect . If choose assign agree , study staff collect data regard rate infection remission ( inactive disease ) status health time information compare rate see patient take part 1 2 group . This comparison information use learn value PE patient receive lower-intensity therapy . Up 125 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
