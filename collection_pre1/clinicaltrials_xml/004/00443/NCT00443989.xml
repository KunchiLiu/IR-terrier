	<detailed_description>Study Objectives 1. determine feasibility recruit patient timely manner 2. determine feasibility obtain data regard hospital post surgical perioperative cardiovascular event , cardiovascular event subsequent six month , 3. determine resource requirement achieve recruitment follow-up goal Study Design We undertake prospective cohort study patient undergo noncardiac surgery 'Herlev University Hospital ' , evaluate incidence best method predict major perioperative cardiovascular event . Sample Size We recruit convenience sample 100 patient pilot study . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Inclusion Criteria - All patient undergo noncardiac surgery eligible : 1. &gt; 45 year age 2. undergoing noncardiac surgery require overnight hospital admission ; AND Exclusion Criterion - We exclude patient refuse 30 day 6 month follow-up . PATIENT RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT Prior start study provide surgeon 'Herlev University Hospital ' copy study protocol , obtain approval approach patient inclusion study . A research physician screen preoperative assessment clinic patient list identify patient fulfill eligibility criterion . The research physician also review daily surgical list eligible patient admit emergency department . The research physician approach patient fulfill eligibility criterion obtain informed consent . Once patient provide consent , research physician collect demographic baseline data ( e.g . age , type surgery , history coronary artery disease , stroke , peripheral vascular disease ) . FOLLOW-UP All patient ECG record 6 12 hour postoperatively 1st , 2nd 3rd day surgery . All patient troponin T drawn 6 12 hour postoperatively 1st , 2nd , 3rd day surgery . Standard order ensure test undertaken . The research nurse review patient ' chart prior hospital discharge note primary secondary outcome . A research physician contact patient phone 30 day 6 month post surgery . If patient indicate experienced outcome study nurse contact physician obtain appropriate documentation . STUDY OUTCOMES The primary outcome composite cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal cardiac arrest 30 day post surgery . An outcome committee adjudicate primary outcome . Sub Classification Death All death classify either cardiovascular non-cardiovascular . Cardiovascular death define death cardiovascular cause include death follow cardiovascular procedure ( e.g . percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ) , cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , pulmonary embolus , stroke , hemorrhage , death due unknown cause . Non-cardiovascular death define death due clearly document non-cardiovascular cause ( e.g . trauma , infection , malignancy ) . The research physician forward outcome committee relevant clinical note , laboratory test , diagnostic imaging test , autopsy information patient die . Myocardial Infarction The diagnosis MI require either one following : 1. typical rise troponin OR typical fall elevate troponin OR rapid rise fall CK-MB . An increase troponin value ( i.e . decision limit MI ) measurement exceed 99th percentile reference control group coefficient variation &lt; 10 % . An increased CK MB value ( i.e . decision limit MI ) one exceed 99th percentile CK MB value reference control group . One follow must also exist diagnosis myocardial infarction : 1. ischemic symptom ( e.g . chest , epigastric , arm , wrist , jaw discomfort OR shortness breath last least 20 minute ) 2. development pathologic Q wave ECG ( Q wave change must present two contiguous lead , &gt; 1 mm depth , Q wave lead I , II , aVL , aVF , V4 , V5 , V6 must &gt; 30 m 3 . ECG change indicative ischemia ( new presume new ST segment elevation depression least two contiguous lead OR new presume new symmetric inversion T wave &gt; 1 mm least two contiguous lead ) 4. coronary artery intervention ( e.g . coronary angioplasty ) 5. new presume new cardiac wall motion abnormality echocardiographic radionuclide image 2 . Pathologic finding acute MI The study nurse forward outcome committee relevant clinical note document ischemic symptom , ECGs , diagnostic imaging test , cardiac enzyme test patient think suffered myocardial infarction . Nonfatal Cardiac Arrest Nonfatal cardiac arrest define successful resuscitation either document presumed ventricular fibrillation sustain ventricular tachycardia , asystole , pulseless electrical alternans . The study nurse forward outcome committee relevant clinical note document event , ECGs and/or ECG rhythm strip patient think suffered nonfatal cardiac arrest . Congestive Heart Failure The definition congestive heart failure require clinical ( i.e . follow sign : elevate jugular venous pressure , respiratory rale , crepitation , presence S3 ) radiographic evidence ( e.g . vascular redistribution , interstitial pulmonary edema , frank alveolar pulmonary edema ) . Clinically Significant Atrial Fibrillation Clinically significant atrial fibrillation define atrial fibrillation result angina , congestive heart failure , symptomatic hypotension , require treatment rate control drug , antiarrhythmic drug , electrical cardioversion . Rehospitalization Cardiovascular Reasons Rehospitalization cardiac reason define rehospitalization congestive heart failure , ischemic symptom ST T wave change ECG , arrhythmia , stroke . Stroke Stroke define new focal neurological deficit think vascular origin sign symptom last 24 hour . EVALUATION OF PILOT OBJECTIVES We determine achieve goal recruit 100 patient 2 month period . We also determine study personnel requirement . We determine achieve follow-up goal 95 % follow-up 6 month . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS All patient must sign consent form participate study .
