	<brief_title>Trial Early Aggressive Drug Therapy Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JIA type arthritis definite cause onset prior 16 year age . JIA cause joint destruction , pain , permanent disability . There multiple type JIA ; collectively , represent one common chronic disease child prevalent pediatric rheumatic illness . Poly-JIA , one type JIA , affect least five joint body within first 6 month disease . Long-term remission poly-JIA uncommon , child must remain multiple combination medication many year . The usual treatment poly-JIA base upon gradual addition medication might effective treat disease . There need find uniformly effective treatment child poly-JIA . Based previous adult arthritis study , appear early window opportunity disease progression aggressive therapy profound beneficial long-term effect . The purpose study compare effectiveness two aggressive drug regimen treat child poly-JIA . Specifically , study determine whether aggressive therapy start first 6 month disease onset result inactive disease clinical remission medication . All participant receive weekly methotrexate shot study . In addition , participant randomly assign one two group : - Group 1 participant receive placebo etanercept shot 12 month daily placebo prednisolone liquid 4 month . - Group 2 participant receive etanercept shot 12 month daily prednisolone liquid 4 month . The study last 12 month include two part . Part A last 1 6 month , depend response assign treatment . If participant still experience active arthritis 6 month , offer open-label treatment etanercept prednisolone . If participant experience inactive disease time prior 6 month , enter Part B study . During Part B , last 6 month , participant remain treatment regimen provide Part A . If participant experience inactive disease follow flare disease time study , stop participate . During study , 11 study visit participant . Study visit include physical exam , include joint evaluation ; blood urine collection ; questionnaire regard function , quality life , medication compliance , medication use , infection , adverse symptom . Blood collect translational study .</detailed_description>
