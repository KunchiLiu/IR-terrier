	<brief_summary>We hypothesize patient receive NSAID drug dyspeptic symptom increase production gastric level free radical . The primary objective study determine Esomeprazole Magnesium increase gastric total antioxidant capacity decrease gastric free radical production human . Patients ( age 18 year old ) history upper GI bleed receive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug develop dyspepsia recruit primary care clinic Washington , DC . All eligible individual undergo biopsy antrum corpus . The subject randomize receive either Zantac OTC Nexium 15 day . On day 15 , patient undergo repeat upper endoscopy obtain biopsy antrum corpus . Tissue sample extract determine total antioxidant capacity lipid peroxide level ( indirect marker free radical production ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Antioxidant Effects Esomeprazole Dyspeptic Patients Receiving Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An extensive meta-analysis confirm dyspeptic symptom common individual use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) ( 1 ) . Both esomeprazole 20 mg daily esomeprazole 40 mg daily show effective placebo control upper gastrointestinal symptom patient receive NSAIDs ( 2 ) . The mechanism H , K-ATPase inhibitor protect NSAID gastropathy remain unclear , although know use clinically effective use H2-receptor antagonist , ranitidine ( 3 ) . The biochemical basis NSAID gastropathy fully understood ( 6 ) . One potential mechanism development gastric damage individual receive NSAIDs oxidative stress relate depletion gastric antioxidant . A recent endoscopic study patient support hypothesis NSAID use associate gastric bleeding decrease gastric mucosal glutathione level ( 7 ) , major cellular micronutrient antioxidant produce mammalian cell . We work possibility activation afferent nerve fiber oxidative stress induce abdominal discomfort use NSAIDs . This notion support animal study show oxidant evoke neurotransmitter release enteric neuron ( 8 ) . This experimental result suggest abnormal tissue level oxygen-derived free radical ( oxidative stress ) could directly activate afferent enteric nerve could alter gastric motility via neuronal mechanism . The hypothesis present proposal patient receive NSAID drug dyspeptic symptom increase production gastric level free radical . The primary aim study examine gastric free radical production total antioxidant capacity patient take NSAID drug dyspeptic symptom . Gastric free radical production total antioxidant capacity measure receive either 15 day daily esomeprazole magnesium ranitidine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients capable provide informed consent , age 18 year old old . Patients eligible take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug daily basis present least 1 week history dyspeptic symptom include epigastric upper abdominal discomfort pain . Patients present complaint heartburn exclude . Patients alarm symptom vomit , evidence bleeding , inadvertent weight loss , dysphagia exclude . Patients exclude upper endoscopy within 6 month prior randomization . At initial visit individual Helicobacter pylori IgG serology drawn ; individual positive serology exclude . This study enroll patient previous history myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular infarction , gastric duodenal ulcer disease , carcinoma . The study enroll patient receive H , KATPase inhibitor within past 2 week . At initial upper endoscopy , patient esophageal ulcer , esophageal cancer , gastric ulcer , gastric cancer , duodenal ulcer exclude .</criteria>
