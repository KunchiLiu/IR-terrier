	<brief_title>Efficacy Orally Disintegrating Selegiline Parkinson 's Patients Experiencing Adverse Effects With Dopamine Agonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disease . Symptomatic therapy primarily aim restore dopamine function brain . Levodopa effective symptomatic treatment ; however , long term use associate motor fluctuation ( period return PD symptom medication effect wear ) dyskinesia ( drug induce involuntary movement include chorea dystonia ) . Once patient develop motor fluctuation treatment option include increase frequency levodopa dosing , switch sustained-release levodopa , add therapy include monoamine oxidase type B ( MAO-B ) inhibitor , dopamine agonist , catechol-o-methyltransferase ( COMT ) inhibitor patient severe motor fluctuation deep brain stimulation surgery . There good evidence base study indicate whether use one class drug superior treatment algorithms recommend class drug initiate patient initially develop motor fluctuation . It believe efficacy different drug class similar . However , frequency adverse effect may differ drug class , study lack . In clinical practice patient develop adverse effect drug one class , drug another class substitute attempt maintain efficacy reduce adverse effect . Dopamine agonists often high risk adverse effect compare MAO B inhibitor . Therefore , rationale study addition orally disintegrate selegiline reduction discontinuation offend dopamine agonist result comparable efficacy reduce adverse event . This study ass safety efficacy addition orally disintegrate selegiline PD patient adverse effect dopamine agonist dose reduction dopamine agonist consider . All patient study receive orally disintegrate selegiline 1.25 mg day dose increase 2.5 mg day tolerate . Comparisons : The status adverse event end study orally disintegrate selegiline compare adverse event start study . In addition , efficacy compare start study dopamine agonist end study orally disintegrate selegiline .</detailed_description>
