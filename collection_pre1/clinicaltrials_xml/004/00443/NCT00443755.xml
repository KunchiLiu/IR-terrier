	<brief_title>Effect Insulin Sensitizer Therapy Atherothrombotic Inflammatory Profiles Associated With Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals diabetes mellitus ( DM ) disproportionately affect atherothrombotic disorder , include cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , peripheral vascular disease . Atherothrombotic disease risk mortality also increase metabolic syndrome , constellation risk factor present 34 % adult , even absence diabetes . Yet , large clinical trial diabetes therapy show conventional cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor , specifically hyperglycemia hypertension , fully account increased CVD risk associate DM . There may etiologic link among insulin resistance , inflammation thrombotic event . This study seek determine certain two diabetes medication ( insulin sensitize medication ) affect certain biomarkers ( laboratory test ) CVD individual untreated DM impair fast glucose . Patients screened inclusion double-blinded , randomize ) , placebo-controlled study . If inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion meet , patient enrol study . Half subject randomize ( like flip coin ) take two insulin sensitizing , anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone ( Actos ) metformin ( Glucophage ) take together three month half subject take correspond placebo ( dummy ) tablet . Laboratory measurement obtain morning ( ) follow two in-patient overnight stay Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Unit . The first stay baseline second stay 3 month baseline . Insulin sensitivity measure morning follow standardized meal precede night , overnight fast . The change ( baseline 3 month ) insulin sensitivity , glycemic control , lipid profile , thrombotic marker inflammatory marker determine compare two arm study ( placebo versus insulin sensitize drug ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : We study 30 patient Type 2 Diabetes impair fast glucose ( 15 men &amp; 15 woman ) &gt; 20 year old . Only patient use lifestyle modification manage diabetes oral hypoglycemic agent insulin include . We enroll subject fast glucose concentration great 100 mg/dl two consecutive occasion Body Mass Index 2736 kg/m^2 . We exclude patient whose blood glucose 180 mg/dl . This avoid need perform home glucose monitor potential unblinding study volunteer . Patients take oral hypoglycemic agent insulin would exclude . Any disease active cardiovascular disease , liver disease , kidney failure ( male serum creatinine &gt; = 1.5mg/dl , female &gt; =1.4 mg/dl ) , active endocrinopathies , debilitate chronic disease , anemia , symptom undiagnosed illness , history alcoholism ( alcohol use &gt; 4oz/day ) substance abuse , chronic neurological disease include Alzheimer 's disease , stroke , etc , myopathy active disease may potentially affect outcome measure . Patients medicine beta blocker , corticosteroid , tricyclic , benzodiazepine , opiate , barbiturate , anticoagulant drug preparation may affect mitochondrial function exclude . People allergic class drug lidocaine also exclude . People pacemaker , certain aneurysm clip claustrophobia also exclude undergo magnetic resonance imaging .</criteria>
