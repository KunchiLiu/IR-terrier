	<brief_title>Outcomes Orthopaedic Surgery Using Gait Laboratory Versus Observational Gait Analysis Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children cerebral palsy , ambulatory , inefficient gait often associate functional disability . Many child candidate orthopaedic surgery , include multi-level soft tissue bony procedure . Pre-operative planning base physical examination visual ( observational ) analysis child 's gait . In centre , patient undergo additional gait analysis motion laboratory . While gait laboratory analysis accept important research tool , controversy clinical utility decision make surgical management population . To date , clinical trial undertaken answer question , appropriate clinical utilization technology yet establish . The consequence uncertainty ambulatory child cerebral palsy either deprive useful assessment tool centre , alternatively subject unnecessary evaluation expensive time consume centre . A multi-centre randomized trial provide evidence support refute need gait laboratory analysis surgical decision-making population . This pilot randomize control trial four sit assess feasibility , provide template design conduct definitive large multi-centred trial extend generalizability across North America jurisdiction . The specific objective include : 1 . Establish feasibility implement randomize trial study design multiple centre 2 . Estimate recruitment rate timelines 3 . Establish responsiveness outcome measure finalize primary &amp; secondary outcome 4 . Estimate effect size functional outcome sample size calculation 5 . Establish data management system ( web-based database ) definitive multi-centre study . 6 . Assess feasibility , reliability face validity pilot health economic data form include health economic evaluation future definitive multi-centre trial . Secondary objective include : 7 . Does addition gait analysis alter surgical decision make video observation alone , perform set pilot trial ? 8 . Evaluate consistency surgical decision making : intra- &amp; inter rater reliability</detailed_description>
