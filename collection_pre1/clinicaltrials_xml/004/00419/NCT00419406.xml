	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) common disorder characterize pruritic inflammatory skin lesion , patient usually individual family history atopic diseases background ( e.g. , allergic asthma rhinitis ) . Defective skin barrier , immunological dysfunction ( type I IV allergy ) , genetic disorder , psychological factor contribute pathogenesis AD . However , among factor , CD4+ Th cell report play particularly crucial role pathogenesis AD . Phototherapy among first-line approach management AD . In context , variety study show beneficial effect natural artificial UV radiation atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . Different broadband UV spectrum ( BB-UVA , BB-UVB , BB-UVA/BB-UVB ) combine treatment modality balneophototherapy PUVA previously proven effective AD . However past ten year see introduction new phototherapeutic regimen AD , include UVA1 NB-UVB.UVA1 seem effective mention broadband spectrum , particular acute severe AD . The aim present study comparison UVA1 NB-UVB phototherapy treatment AD . Additionally , course several cytokine , human beta-defensins , SMAD-proteins evaluate course treatment .</detailed_description>
