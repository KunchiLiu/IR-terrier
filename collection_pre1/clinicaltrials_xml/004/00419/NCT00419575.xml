	<brief_summary>The aim observational study evaluate FDA approve immune system monitor assay ( Immunknow , Cylex Inc. Columbia , MD ) renal transplant recipient use standard immunosuppression prophylaxis protocols time transplantation twelve month follow-up period . The primary endpoint incidence acute rejection infection correlation event assay may measure recipient immune response . Secondary endpoint include evaluation renal function , patient graft survival , incidence post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder duration extent lymphocyte depletion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As compare previous era , renal transplantation procedure associate low acute rejection rate excellent one year graft survival . Despite success , long term graft survival rate improve significantly . The reason late graft loss multi-factorial , include chronic rejection infection . Thus , avoidance chronic immunosuppression tantamount avoid graft patient threaten infection , avoidance immunosuppression necessary prevent graft loss acute chronic rejection . Renal allograft loss particular viral pathogen , BK virus , become evident era modern immunosuppression likely reflect relative immunosuppression . We , others , use BK detection imprecise marker immunosuppression help guide adjustment chronic immunosuppressive therapy . While screen presence BK virus helpful avoid immunosuppression potential graft loss BK nephropathy , correlate assay readily available provide evidence immunosuppression , indicate risk graft loss rejection . At present , proven assay measure strength immune system unavailable , definite marker under-immunosuppression remain infection rejection , respectively . A tool help tailor chronic immunosuppressive therapy decrease incidence either two extreme would significant value help prolong allograft survival decrease risk immunosuppressive therapy renal transplant recipient . In observational study , plan use standard immunosuppressive regimen well standard infection prophylaxis addition immune monitoring assay ( ImmunoKnow ) . This assay measure ATP production recipient T cell propose marker immune function . While interest , yet , publish study describe utility test immune monitoring adult renal transplant recipient . As assay remain unproven viable tool define immunosuppression , blind ImmunoKnow result course study . The result immune monitor assay use retrospective analysis determine clinically relevant correlation value obtain episode rejection , infection , development donor specific antibody . If significant correlation suggest , evaluation subsequent study eventual incorporation prospective patient care may warrant .</detailed_description>
