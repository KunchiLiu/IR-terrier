	<brief_summary>We previously demonstrate postconditioning coronary angioplasty decrease infarct size ( measure cardiac enzyme release ) patient ongoing acute myocardial infarction . It currently unknown whether postconditioning actually decrease simply delays myocardial cell death reperfusion . In addition , long term effect postconditioning recovery myocardial contraction remain elusive . The objective present study determine whether infarct size reduction angioplasty postconditioning maintain 6 month whether functional recovery improve one year post-infarction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized , control , single-blinded trial compare postconditioning control ( intervention ) . Postconditioning consist four episode one minute inflation follow one minute deflation angioplasty balloon , start within one minute reflow direct stenting occlude coronary artery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient , age 18 , suspect first acute myocardial infarction , within 6 hour onset chest pain , need emergency revascularization angioplasty . Patients must display fully occlude ( TIMI zero flow ) culprit coronary artery , absence visible collateral exhibit TIMI flow &gt; 2 direct stenting angioplasty . Cardiac arrest cardiogenic shock occlusion circumflex coronary artery</criteria>
