	<brief_title>Effect Ambulatory Continuous Femoral Nerve Blocks Readiness-for-Discharge Following Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Procedures do part normal clinical care ( even participate research ) : You monitor place ( blood-pressure cuff ) give medicine intravenous line make sleepy . The anesthesiologist place tiny tube , call catheter , near nerve use follow surgery . This involve carefully clean immediate area upper thigh catheter place , numb site catheter local anesthetic place skin , place needle skin numb area near nerve , put catheter needle tip next nerve , remove needle leave catheter place . You still go sleep surgery , comfortable wake numb medicine work take away much pain . If part study , would go recovery room room hospital 3-5 day , catheter would probably remove morning surgery . After removal catheter , would depend oral intravenous pain medicine ( `` opioids '' —like morphine ) control surgical pain . You would go home oral opioids since intravenous opioids provide home . 2 . Procedures do participate research study : From recovery room go surgical ward . During stay hospital ability push button small infusion pump—a little device hold put medicine catheter bath nerve local anesthetic—to give medicine tube nerve pain . If help enough , take pain pill help . And help enough , give opioids ( strong pain medicine like morphine ) intravenous line . 3 . On morning surgery , medicine little infusion pump replace either ( 1 ) medicine , ( 2 ) salt water , `` normal saline '' . The pharmacist determine randomly—like flip coin—and neither doctors/nurses care know . This keep u inadvertently/ unconsciously affect result study . 4 . You undergo physical therapy follow check see ready go home . This include walk morning afternoon physical therapist . When ready go home beginning third day surgery , may go home little infusion pump tube delivers fluid . You give prescription pain pill case need pain relief . 5 . One study investigator call night ensure comfortable first 6 night surgery , give phone pager number physician ( anesthesiologist ) available contact 24 hours/day , 7 days/week . A research nurse call five night begin day surgery ask comfort level study-related information satisfaction level . 6 . On fourth even follow surgery catheter remove . You two option available remove catheter . You call physician talk caregiver process phone -- hurt bleed . Your option come back hospital health care professional remove catheter . The pump , catheter remain fluid disposable hurt people pet , throw away . A physician call night catheter come ensure comfortable . 7 . A research nurse call 7 day 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month follow surgery . Each call less five minute length time ask question level pain , stiffness joint functional ability . Your participation limit 12 month surgery phone call .</detailed_description>
