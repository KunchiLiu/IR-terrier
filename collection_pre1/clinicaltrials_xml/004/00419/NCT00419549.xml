	<brief_summary>ERCP diagnostic therapeutic procedure require patient suspected common bile duct stone , malignant biliary obstruction , biliary fistula , etc . Pancreatitis may occur complication procedure 5-10 % ERCP procedures . This complication manifest persist pain 24 hour ERCP , along raise level pancreatic enzymes blood . Most case post-ERCP pancreatitis mild , may severe lead prolonged hospitalization patient . The occurrence complication unpredictable . There number attempt prevent complication . These include give certain drug ERCP e.g . octreotide , somatostatin , steroid , etc . However , successful . Recently , study show application glyceryl trinitrate patch skin ERCP might reduce incidence post ERCP-pancreatitis . Another study show per rectal administration diclofenac tablet ERCP procedure also reduce occurrence post ERCP pancreatitis . Other experimental study show certain anti-inflammatory drug like cox-2 inhibitor may also effective . The investigator want study whether transdermal patch glyceryl trinitrate administration injectable cox-2 inhibitor Valdecoxib ( pro-drug Parecoxib ) prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis patient undergo ERCP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis represent common complication ERCP . The reported incidence complication vary less 1 % 40 % , rate 10 % report prospective study involve non-selected patient . Although episode ( 90 % ) post-ERCP pancreatitis mild , small percentage patient ( 10 % ) may develop severe pancreatitis result significant morbidity occasional mortality . Despite technical improvement recent year , incidence complication decrease . The risk factor development post ERCP acute pancreatitis well know . Balloon dilatation sphincter Oddi , difficult papillary cannulation , pancreatic sphincterotomy multiple pancreatic duct injection find independent risk factor post-procedure pancreatitis ( Odds ratio 4.5 , 3.4 , 3.1 , 2.7 respectively ) recent prospective , multicenter study Freeman et al . Opacification main pancreatic duct alone ( MPD ) associate 31 % incidence hyperamylasemia . This figure similar 24 % incidence hyperamylasemia occur cholangiography alone . However injection pressure volume contrast medium inject pancreatic duct contribute ductal epithelial acinar injury disruption intercellular tight junction backflow interstitial space . The role osmolarity ionic nature contrast medium controversial . However non-ionic , low osmolarity contrast medium preferred endoscopists . Electrocautery vicinity MPD orifice may produce edema tissue subsequent obstruction . Etta et al recently show use pure cut current significantly reduce pancreatitis rate compare blended current ( 3 % vs 11 % ) .Precut access papillotomy associate high risk pancreatitis use endoscopists less experience , hand experience endoscopists.Operator experience also seem potential risk factor post ERCP complication . Large volume center perform &gt; 200 procedure per year significantly less overall complication ( 2.0 % vs 7.1 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) less complication relate death ( 0.18 % vs 0.75 % , p &lt; 0.05 ) , compare low volume center large Italian multicenter prospective study . Various agent try aim prevent post ERCP pancreatitis last 10 year . These include Gabexate , Somatostatin , Nifedipine , Octreotide , Hydrocortisone , Prednisone , Allopurinol , Interleukin-10 , Methylprednisolone evaluate randomize control studies.Of agent Interleukin-10 , Somatostatin Gabexate find efficacious . However 13 patient need treat prophylactically Somatostatin 27 Gabexate prevent single case post ERCP pancreatitis . Hence agent unlikely cost-effective universally applicable . The ideal agent prevent complication cheap , widely applicable rational basis . It find cannulation trauma papilla electrocautery lead sphincter Oddi spasm and/or papillary edema , thus obstruct free flow pancreatic juice contrast resultant acute pancreatic inflammation . Akashi et al recently show although frequency pancreatitis high patient underwent sphincterotomy , frequency severe pancreatitis within 48 hour worsen pancreatitis 48 hour significantly low group . Thus lower intraductal pressure endoscopic sphincterotomy ( ES ) mitigate severity post procedural pancreatitis . In fact pancreatic stent placement show effective prevention post ERCP pancreatitis high risk patient . In recent randomized trial , patient either 5 Fr nasopancreatic catheter/a stent place end ERCP endoprosthesis place . Patients undergo MPD stenting low frequency pancreatitis compare control group ( 28 % vs 5 % , p &lt; 0.05 ) 10 However pancreatic stenting regular basis difficult impractical solution . Repeated attempts place pancreatic stent may cause harm , second procedure may require remove stent . Hence institute adequate drainage MPD end ERCP seem rational useful pharmacological rather mechanical mean may desirable . Sphincter Oddi relaxation modify cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) nitric oxide ( NO ) physiological state besides complex neural control involve sympathetic , parasympathetic enteric nervous system . Jurkowska et al studied role nitric oxide ( NO ) cerulein induce rat pancreatitis model . It find glyceryl trinitrate ( NTG , NO donor ) L-arginine ( substrate NO synthesis ) result significant attenuation pancreatic damage well earlier recovery augment cell proliferation comparison saline treat L-NNA ( NO synthase inhibitor ) group . In randomized double-blind study , prophylactive treatment NTG ( 2mg give sublingually 5 min endoscopy ) compare placebo 186 patient . The incidence pancreatitis lower NTG group compare placebo ( 7 90 v 17 96 ; p &lt; 0.05 ) . Mean serum amylase value similar two group . A recent study test hypothesis transdermal NTG could effective prevention post ERCP pancreatitis . One hundred forty-four patient randomize : 71 receive 15mg NTG patch 73 placebo patch . In control group pancreatitis develop 11 patient versus 3 NTG group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Twenty four hour baseline serum amylase lipase ratio also low NTG group . Hence NO donor seem efficacious prevent hyperamylasemia post ERCP pancreatitis Regardless initial trigger , acinar cell injury lead oxidative stress , nuclear translocation nuclear factor kappa-B subsequent transcription chemo pro-inflammatory cytokine . This follow chemo-attraction activation macrophage , T lymphocytes neutrophil , responsible acinar necrosis amplification pro-inflammatory cascade . Finally amplification Kupffer cell , systemic inflammatory response syndrome multiple organ dysfunction occur . All event occur within short period time , likely within hour two . There thus short therapeutic window theoretically possible shut inflammatory cascade . Cyclooxygenases ( COX ) key enzyme prostaglandin synthesis important role regulation inflammation . Both isoforms COX synthesize acinar cell expression differentially regulate . Upon induction pancreatitis rat model , COX-2 mRNA increase COX-1 expression remain constant . Song et al studied effect pharmacological inhibition COX-2 genetic deletion COX-2 cerulein induce acute pancreatitis mouse . In group , severity pancreatitis pancreatitis induce lung injury reduce compare non-inhibited strain COX-2 sufficient mouse . This indicate COX-2 play important proinflammatory role pancreatitis COX-2 inhibitor may beneficial prevent acute pancreatitis reduce severity . Parecoxib prodrug Valdecoxib -a selective COX-2 inhibitor . Following IV IM injection , Parecoxib rapidly convert Valdecoxib , pharmacologically active substance enzymatic hydrolysis liver . Following single intramuscular injection 20mg Valdecoxib , peak blood level achieve approximately 1 hour . Parecoxib demonstrate incidence gastroduodenal ulceration similar placebo twice daily dos effect platelet aggregation bleeding compare placebo .</detailed_description>
