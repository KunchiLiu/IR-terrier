	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIM # 1 : Determine relationship parenchymal tissue alveolar volume normal lung growth early life We hypothesize first two year life parenchymal surface area alveolar volume increase somatic growth ; however , ratio surface area volume remain constant , ventilation within lung become homogenous . SPECIFIC AIM # 2 : Determine pulmonary sequela premature birth ass effectiveness early treatment strategy upon pulmonary sequela . We hypothesize premature birth impedes growth development lung parenchyma airways corrected-age 1-year . In addition , initiate continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) permissive ventilatory strategy premature infant birth improve lung growth lung function compare treatment early surfactant conventional ventilation .</detailed_description>
