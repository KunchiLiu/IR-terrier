	<brief_title>Immunogenicity One Versus Two Doses Killed Oral Cholera Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholera important public health problem worldwide , particularly endemic area develop world . In 2004 , 101 383 cholera case 2345 death report WHO .

Distribution 2 dos cholera vaccine often difficult field setting limit utility emergency situation , since interval 2 week usually require dos . Recent data Vietnam suggest great vibriocidal response follow 2 dos elicit compare previous formulation . Furthermore , study Bangladesh compare immune response vaccine among child supplement vitamin A zinc , seroconversion first dose robust group suggest one dose may use control cholera . Data regard immune response follow one dose reformulate vaccine currently unavailable . If single dose vaccine confirm immunogenic recipient , vaccine may use extensively public health purpose , especially time outbreaks .
