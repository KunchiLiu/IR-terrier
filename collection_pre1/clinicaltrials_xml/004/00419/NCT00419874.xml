	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) one common traumatic event , occur approximately 200 per 100,000 , know risk factor later development epileptic seizure . This occur 17 % TBI patient , account approximately 20 % symptomatic epilepsy ( Annegers , JF . et al , 1998 ) . Typically , post-traumatic epilepsy ( PTE ) develop several week even year event . PTE often chronic poorly control pharmacologically . Although several factor attribute increased risk develop PTE ( e.g . severity trauma , type brain injury , time appearance first seizure ) , mechanisms underlie remain unknown . Similar TBI , ischemic injury , frequently occur elderly population main cause new onset epilepsy age group . It still know risk factor mechanisms underlie post-ischemic epilepsy . Under normal condition central nervous system protected operation blood- brain barrier ( BBB ) . Following brain injury ( either traumatic ischemic ) BBB know disrupt , lead focal edema alter extracellular composition . We recently establish method quantitative evaluation integrity BBB use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan . Using method able identify BBB disruption patient suffer various pathology ( Tomkins , O. et al . 2001 ; Avivi , E. et al . 2004 ) . Such altered permeability may last year follow acute event find correlate area abnormal neurological function ( Korn , A. et al . 2005 ) In recent work use animal model , show follow focal disruption BBB focus epileptiform activity generate within several day . Such pathological activity remain several week , long BBB retain former function ( Seiffert , E. et al . 2004 ; Iven , S. et al . 2006 ) . Furthermore , condition may later lead anatomical alteration see brain MRI scan , well histological section . Such animal suffer functional deterioration neuronal degeneration disrupt region ( Tomkins , O. et al . 2006 ) . In work test hypothesis BBB disruption follow brain injury increase risk long-term disability , development brain dysfunction , epileptic seizure neuroanatomical alteration . For combine prospective retrospective study patient follow cerebral cortical injury ( traumatic , hemorrhagic ischemic ) . Clinical , functional anatomical measure obtain addition BBB permeability measure .</detailed_description>
