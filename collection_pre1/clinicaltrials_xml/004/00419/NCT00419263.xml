	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Safety Peramivir Subjects With Uncomplicated Acute Influenza .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peramivir neuraminidase inhibitor previously show effective treatment human experimental influenza use oral formulation . Parenteral formulation peramivir ( intramuscular intravenous injection ) enter clinical development time Phase 2 study . A series Phase 1 study human volunteer complete provided safety pharmacokinetic result support initiation Phase 2 multinational , randomize , double-mask study compare antiviral efficacy safety peramivir administer intramuscularly versus placebo adult uncomplicated acute influenza . Because unique pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property peramivir - long terminal half life plasma extend duration bind neuraminidase enzyme - subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive single dose one three treatment : peramivir 150 mg , peramivir 300 mg , placebo . Study drug administer one 2-mL intramuscular injection gluteal muscle ( total 4 mL , inject divided dos ) . This multinational study originally conduct approximately 80 site US Canada .
