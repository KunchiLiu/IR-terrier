	<brief_summary>Prior surgery , pharmacist randomly assign participate patient one two group . One group get injection knee surgery contain medication limit pain antibiotic . A second group get injection knee surgery contain pain medication antibiotic along corticosteroid control inflammation . Corticosteroids anti-inflammatory medication , confuse muscle-building anabolic steroid may hear news . Each patient equal chance either two group . This study test safety efficacy methylprednisolone acetate treatment pain inflammation follow total knee replacement .</brief_summary>
