	<brief_summary>Patients sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) , also call sleep apnea , experience nighttime disrupt sleep , stop breathe short period night , get sufficient oxygen brain . This frequently result daytime impairment include difficulty memory . The state-of-the-art treatment SDB Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) . Many non-demented SDB patient successfully treat CPAP show improvement memory cognitive function . Data show patient Parkinson 's disease high rate SDB . Patients Parkinson 's disease also often problem memory . This study test effect treat SDB among patient Parkinson 's disease SDB . Specifically , study test effect CPAP treatment SDB sleep ; effect CPAP treatment daytime sleepiness , cognition , overall quality life mood ; effect CPAP treatment frequency symptom REM behavior disorder restless legs syndrome ; effect continue CPAP use ( beyond six week study ) SDB , sleep , cognition , mood quality life ; whether study-partner feel CPAP improve patient 's sleep , mood overall functioning ; whether study-partners feel sleep , mood overall functioning improve patient 's sleep improve 6-week protocol follow-up opting continue use CPAP .</brief_summary>
