	<brief_summary>Introduction : Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) consensus treatment end-stage knee osteoarthritis . The peri-operative rehabilitation important part outcome procedure . Previous study show correlation pre-operative functional status intensiveness post-operative rehabilitation post operative function patient . An important part peri-operative rehabilitation TKA neuromuscular control re-education . A novel biomechanical device comprise four individually calibrated element attach onto foot-worn platform recently develop . This device capable bring patient functional bio-mechanical alignment stand walking , simultaneously strengthen dynamic stabilizer train neuromuscular control mean control biomechanical perturbation . Objectives : The aim study evaluate influence pre post operative training biomechanical device mention functional outcome quality life patient undergoing TKA . Design Setting : Randomized , control double blind prospective trial Patients : 120 patient candidate TKA Interventions : Patients randomly assign five group ( active , sham control ) follow fourteen month ( two moth pre-operative twelve month post-operative ) . All group undergo post-operative physical therapy ( PT ) accord standard guideline . In addition , active group treat device four biomechanical element individually calibrate patient . The sham group treat device ; however , biomechanical element zero perturbation position along central longitudinal line shoe-platform . The control group treat accord standard post-operative protocol . The five group : 1 . Pre- operative BD train post-operative PT BD train 2 . Pre- operative sham train post-operative PT BD train 3 . Pre- operative sham train post-operative PT sham train 4 . No pre-operative training ( accord guideline Israel ) post-operative PT BD training . 5 . No pre-operative training ( accord guideline Israel ) post-operative PT sham training . Primary Outcome Measures : Spatio-temporal measure ( record Gait-Rite™ ) Aggregated Locomotor Function ( ALF ) assessment . Secondary Outcome Measures : Pain function questionnaire measure Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) Quality life evaluate SF-36 quality life questionnaire . Measurements take day-1 ( two month TKA ) four station : 1 Week prior TKA , Three month post TKA , six month post TKA twelve month post TKA</brief_summary>
