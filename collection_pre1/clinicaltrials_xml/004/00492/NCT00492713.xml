	<detailed_description>Dark chocolate one richest source polyphenols , example , standard 40g portion dark chocolate contain 400-800 mg polyphenols , compare red wine ( 170 mg /100ml ) apple ( 200 mg/piece ) . Cocoa polyphenols , notably catechin , exist lipid water-based environment ( amphipathic ) , mean spare lipophillic hydrophilic vitamin . There number human trial conduct use chocolate cocoa measure various endpoint . Most conducted dark chocolate . An article Nature find bioavailability epicatechin milk chocolate substantially reduce compare dark , even dark take glass milk ( Serafini et al 2003 ) . The hypothesis milk proteins bind polyphenols , make unavailable . Subsequent study able reproduce , none conduct use solid chocolate first study , do use drink matrix , may completely alter bind interaction polyphenols protein . Previous bioavailability trial dark chocolate show 12 fold increase plasma epicatechin 2 hour consumption 80g chocolate contain 557 mg total polyphenols ( 137 mg epicatechin ) ( Rein et al 2000 ) concurrent increase plasma total antioxidant capacity decrease TBARS . Another study show increase epicatechin 2 hour administer 25g chocolate chip contain 220 mg flavanols procyanidins , concurrent increase prostacyclin/leukotriene ratio reduction platelet-related hemostasis ( Holt et al 2002 ) . This study design blind , three arm crossover trial . The primary outcome measure compare plasma polyphenol level consumption 3 chocolate ( 2 milk , 1 dark ) secondary outcome measure characterise time course polyphenols blood investigate individual variation Tmax Cmax use future study . All volunteer try chocolate type similar taste &amp; appearance ( though milk dark likely still distinguishable volunteer , investigator ) . Subjects undergo medical screening , anthropometry , physical activity dietary assessment randomisation order consumption . Bloods take time course next 24 hour , urine .</detailed_description>
