In addition environmental social cue , physical factor , age , hydration status , illness , could adversely affect ability entrain ( adjust ) quickly . The stressor flight , noise , vibration , decrease humidity , barometric pressure change , decrease partial pressure oxygen contribute crew traveler health destination . Being synchronicity environment cause jet lag symptom . Travel time zone place body situation must sleep tired awaken internal cue initiate sleep . The brain 's internal clock suprachiasmatic nucleus within hypothalamus body constant state circadian adjustment remain entrain give time zone . In addition subjective feeling well measurable change associate daily pattern . For example , core body temperature change throughout day decrease fall asleep . Melatonin level increase even night recede day . Ramelteon melatonin receptor 1 melatonin receptor 2 agonist currently market US treatment insomnia characterize difficulty sleep onset .
