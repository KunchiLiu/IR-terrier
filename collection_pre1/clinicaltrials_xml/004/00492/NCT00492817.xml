	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find stereotactic body radiotherapy spine use computerized tomography ( CT ) -on-Rails safe effective treatment metastatic spine tumor . Objectives : - Establish safety efficacy use stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) treat spine para-spinal tumor single session . - Document frequency severity pain , symptom symptom interference , well quality life treatment . - Document change neurological function define interval compare pre-treatment neurological function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CT-on-Rails system place radiation treatment machine room CT scanner CT scanner help deliver radiation precisely . You MRI spine within 1 month registration study . You also fill health survey , symptom inventory , Brief Pain Inventory within 1 week registration . Each survey take 5 minute complete . You CT-simulation . The simulation like CT scan special body frame use keep move scan late radiation treatment . However , radiation deliver simulation . You ask question medical history complete neurological exam first consultation , registration . The neurological exam involve test upper low motor strength , sensation light touch , reflex , mental exam , evaluation way walk . Radiation treatment last 2 2 1/2 hour give 1 day 1 1 1/2 week simulation . You device ( similar plastic wrap ) place around hold still treatment . You check level pain and/or discomfort start session radiation , may take pain medication start session . All participant treat radiation therapy guide CT-on-Rails procedure . On day radiation , also receive CT scan use CT-on-Rails treatment room , immediately radiation treatment . During treatment , physician monitoring side effect . If experience severe side effect , radiation treatment stop , take study . After treatment study end , telephone , mail , facsimile ( Fax ) follow-up schedule 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 week radiation . You ask question side effect pain experience therapy may start . You follow-up visit schedule 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month every 6 month rest life . At follow-up visit , ask question medical history , neurological exam , neurologic function evaluate . Any pain medication taking note . You ask MRI spine 3 , 6 , 9 , 12,18 , 24 month , year rest life . You also ask complete 3 questionnaire evaluate symptom , pain , quality life follow-up visit . Each questionnaire take around 5 minute complete . This investigational study . The equipment use study FDA-approved medical device commercially available . However , way device use study experimental . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
