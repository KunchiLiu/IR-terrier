	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic surgery initially perform surgeon France 1987 introduce United States 1988 . This minimally invasive procedure perform cholecystectomy , standard care treatment gallbladder disease . Recent advance laparoscopic surgery success cholecystectomy permit procedure use treat variety disease diagnose staging . Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery advantage conventional open surgery , include small incision , early gastrointestinal ( GI ) recovery , short hospital stay , less pain , few complication . In recent year evidence accumulate operation laparoscopic procedure produce outcome comparable produced routine open surgery may actually surpass others . Whereas laparoscopic surgery successful well accept various abdominal pelvic surgery , use area colorectal surgery progress slow rate . There challenge impact wider use laparoscopic bowel resection ( LBR ) . These include technical difficulty associate size colon , need complete immobilization bowel need watertight , non-leaking anastomosis . In addition , equipment expensive surgeon require specialized training . Results study colon cancer indicate LBR reduces perioperative morbidity , decrease hospital stay comparable cancer-related survival compare open colectomy . The use LBR short-term outcome increase clinical trial data demonstrate superiority LBR , particularly short-term outcome conventional open surgery . Gastrointestinal recovery related patient outcome early postoperative period follow open segmental colon resection extensively evaluate previous randomize , control , multicenter trial . Current data laparoscopic colectomy collect retrospective , single center clinical trial lack standardized definition endpoint . Therefore , prospective , multicenter study LBR undertaken determine surgical technique impact GI recovery relate outcomes relative open laparotomy . The primary objective study assess clinical course gastrointestinal ( GI ) recovery hospital length stay subject undergo laparoscopic partial large bowel resection . The secondary objective ass immediate post discharge clinical course subject undergoing laparoscopic bowel resection respect opioid-induced GI effect , daily surgical pain , opioid consumption laxative use .</detailed_description>
