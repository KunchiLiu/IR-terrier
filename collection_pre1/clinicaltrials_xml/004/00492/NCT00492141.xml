	<detailed_description>L9-NC temozolomide work block certain tumor cell function , keep tumor cell grow . If find eligible take part study , give L9-NC aerosol ( inhaled spray ) mouth face mask Cycle 1 therapy . You receive L9-NC 30 minute day , 5 day row . This do 2 week . Doctors monitor safety another 2 week treatment . A treatment cycle last 4 week . Your first L9-NC aerosol treatment , Cycle 1 , give M.D . Anderson . You may receive rest treatment home , experience bad side effect first aerosol treatment . During Cycle 2 therapy , experience intolerable side effect , give temozolomide . You receive temozolomide mouth day , 5 day row , first week cycle . You also continue receive L9-NC aerosol 30 minute day , 5 day row , 2 week . Doctors monitor safety another 2 week treatment . During Cycle 3 therapy , experience intolerable side effect , continue give temozolomide mouth day , 5 day row , first week cycle . You receive L9-NC aerosol twice day , 12 hour apart , 30 minute , 5 day row , 2 week . If experience bad side effect Cycle 2 , dose temozolomide decrease , continue receive L9-NC aerosol day ( instead twice day ) , 5 day row , 2 week . For cycle treatment , experience bad side effect Cycle 3 , receive L9-NC day , instead twice day . If already receive L9-NC day , experience intolerable side effect Cycle 3 , take study . You show spirometry ( lung test measure much fast air move lung ) monitor safety therapy . You ask treatment cycle , first 2 cycle . If dose L9-NC increase twice day , also ask spirometry second dose day Cycle 3 . For future cycle , ask spirometry last dose L9-NC , first day week treatment . The result spirometry need sent M.D . Anderson telephone , test . The result send electronically . They review every day receive , contact abnormal result . Your doctor may also perform additional spirometry need . You examine doctor second third cycle therapy ( every 4 week ) . You blood draw ( 2 tablespoon ) every week first 2 3 cycle therapy . After Cycle 3 therapy , blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) do cycle therapy . Chest x-rays , CT chest scan , image study , do beginning study , do measure disease repeat every 3 cycle therapy . You also breathe function test , doctor think necessary . If tumor size decrease treatment , may therapy performed , surgery , radiation , radiofrequency ablation , outside study . If treatment study alone , combination therapy , result complete disappearance disease , treatment study may continue 6 cycle . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If take study intolerable side effect , followed-up 30 day treatment end side effect go away . If complete remission , chest x-ray , CT chest scan , image study , do beginning study , do look disease every 3 month completion treatment . This investigational study . L9-NC authorized FDA use research . Temozolomide approve FDA . The use drug together study experimental . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
