	<brief_summary>Purpose study : The purpose study make sorafenib available patient advance Renal Cell Carcinoma , fail prior systemic therapy advance disease ( i.e . require second line treatment ) , access eligible clinical trial sorafenib may benefit treatment sorafenib . Patients treat orally 400 mg bid sorafenib continuous basis single agent . Patients may continue treatment Disease Progression , intolerable toxicity , patient choose withdraw consent patient unlikely benefit treatment . Overall , participation study help determine following : - Find patient receive Sorafenib live long - Find Sorafenib help slow worsen kidney cancer - Find Sorafenib effect tumour</brief_summary>
