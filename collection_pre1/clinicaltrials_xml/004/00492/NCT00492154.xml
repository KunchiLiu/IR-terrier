	<brief_summary>The fracture distal forearm common trauma child . Sometimes one bone becomes shorten result fracture fragment overlap . When amount shorten exists , concern regard relationship distal radio-ulnar joint ( DRUJ ) arise . The common opinion express one textbook represent one sentence , usually one bone shorten well tolerate , probably cause problem , clinical significance . However , pathology ulna plus minus variant well describe may cause ulno-carpal abut syndrome radiocarpal pain . This concern may lead aggressive approach treatment fracture , attempt make equal bone length . We find literature study investigate problem . We postulate obvious shorten one bone may cause inequality DRUJ clinically significant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We evaluate x-ray film child time injury age 1 day 12 year . The selection x-ray film do base specific code wrist x-ray ( Ulna Radius ) . The evaluation merely child treat hospital 1996 2000.We aim find case fracture heal 1cm shorten one forearm 's bone ( Radius Ulna ) . We go compare case another 20 patient characteristic latter group exception fracture heal without shorten . The two group match age , gender diagnosis . These patient summon clinic adult respect skeletal maturity . The patient evaluate , include clinical examination hand wrist ( left right ) , motion rang , motor muscle function , description abnormality x-ray wrist .</detailed_description>
