	<brief_title>Bortezomib Rituximab Patients With Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bortezomib design block protein play role cell function growth , may cause cancer cell die . Rituximab design attach cancer cell , may cause die . Cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , cladribine design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Dexamethasone design decrease inflammation . It also use treat certain form cancer . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . The test may perform within 28 day start study drug . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . Your medical history record . You ask fill questionnaire regard neuropathy ( nerve problem ) may . The questionnaire take 1 minute complete . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . You also blood ( 4-5 teaspoon ) draw one time urine collect ( 24 hour ) check status WM . This blood also use screen hepatitis . You x-ray chest . You compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen pelvis see part body involved WM . If chest x-ray positive , also CT scan chest . Women able child must negative blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test start study . You also bone marrow aspiration biopsy . To collect bone marrow aspirate/biopsy , area hip bone make numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . If find eligible participate study , begin take study drug . You give two 35-day cycle bortezomib rituximab . Bortezomib give needle vein 3-5 second Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Rituximab also give vein Days 8 22 . The first rituximab infusion ( vein ) usually take 6-8 hour . Later infusion generally short , take 4 hour complete . While receive bortezomib/rituximab ( 2-3 month ) , valacyclovir ( anti-viral drug ) take mouth , day . During study , dose bortezomib , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn routine test . Your vital sign measure . You ask side effect may experience . You also ask answer questionnaire neuropathy may . Stem cell cell blood cell develop . If respond first 2 cycle bortezomib/rituximab , stem cell collect . You sign separate consent form describe procedure risk . After stem cell collection , 1 cycle cladribine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab give . Cladribine give vein day 2 hour Days 1-5 . Cyclophosphamide take mouth , twice day Days 1-5 , rituximab give vein week 4 week . If respond first cycle bortezomib/rituximab , take study . If respond first respond second cycle bortezomib/rituximab , receive third cycle . The bortezomib/rituximab give manner first 2 cycle . If respond third cycle bortezomib/rituximab , stem cell collect . After stem cell collection , 1 cycle cladribine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab give . Cladribine give vein day 2 hour Days 1-5 . Cyclophosphamide take mouth , twice day Days 1-5 , rituximab give vein week 4 week . If respond third cycle bortezomib/rituximab , give chemotherapy regimen contain drug rituximab , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , together dexamethasone . This combination know modified R-Hyper-CVAD . Rituximab give vein 4 hour Day 1 . Cyclophosphamide give vein every 12 hour Days 1-4 . Doxorubicin vincristine give vein continuously 24 hour Days 1-4 . Dexamethasone take mouth daily Days 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 . If partial response see modify R-Hyper-CVAD , stem cell collect . You receive 1 cycle cladribine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab . Cladribine give vein day 2 hour Days 1-5 . Cyclophosphamide take mouth , twice day Days 1-5 , rituximab give vein week 4 week . About 1 week start cycle chemotherapy , blood ( 4-5 teaspoon ) draw routine test see WM respond . You may also need collect urine 24 hour , depend first test initially positive . You also complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . If CT scan positive initially , need repeat 2 cycle bortezomib/rituximab every 6 month . Once partial response confirm CT scan , need repeat CT scan anymore . If disease respond modify R-Hyper-CVAD , take study . Responding participant follow least every 6 month first 36 month ( end therapy ) . After , follow least year unless disease get bad needs re-treated . For follow-up evaluation , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Blood ( 4-5 teaspoon ) urine ( 24 hour ) collect check status WM . If x-rays and/or CT scan do begin study positive , repeat x-rays and/or CT scan . For patient partial response , follow-up evaluation least every 3 month . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Blood ( 4-5 tablespoon ) urine ( 24 hour ) collect check status WM . You take study partial complete response follow 3 cycle bortezomib/rituximab 2 cycle modify R-Hyper-CVAD . You take study disease get bad plan therapy study doctor feel require repetition . You take study intolerable side effect occur . You take study treatment bortezomib delayed 2 week . You take study develop certain illness , certain change health study doctor decides may make treatment study drug unacceptable . Once take study , end-of-study visit . At visit , physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight perform . You ask side effect may experience . You ask answer questionnaire regard neuropathy may . Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status WM . You need collect urine 24 hour see WM respond . If initial CT scan show lesion appear cause WM , CT scan repeat time . If partial complete response end plan therapy , need return clinic follow-up visit least every 6 month first 36 month ( end therapy ) . After , follow-up visit least year , unless disease get bad re-treatment necessary . At follow-up visit , physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . You ask side effect may experience . Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status WM . Depending result original urine test , may need collect urine 24 hour see WM respond . If initial CT scan show lesion appear cause WM , CT scan x-ray chest repeat time . This investigational study . Cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , rituximab commercially available FDA-approved treatment Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia . Bortezomib , dexamethasone , cladribine , drug combination use study authorize use research . Bortezomib FDA approve register Europe treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least one prior therapy . Tests/procedures require study consider part routine medical care . Up 38 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
