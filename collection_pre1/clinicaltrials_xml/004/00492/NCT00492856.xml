	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , gemtuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Sometimes cancer may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective observation give maintenance therapy treat acute promyelocytic leukemia . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study tretinoin , mercaptopurine , methotrexate see well work give maintenance therapy compare observation combination chemotherapy treat patient acute promyelocytic leukemia . ( Randomization observation group close 8/15/10 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0521 , Combination Chemotherapy With Without Gemtuzumab Followed By Tretinoin , Mercaptopurine , Methotrexate Observation Treating Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) among patient previously untreated low intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) PCR-negative Promyelocytic-retinoic acid receptor alpha ( PML-RARα ) consolidation therapy receive maintenance therapy versus patient receive maintenance therapy . ( Randomization observation arm close 8/15/10 ) - Assess toxicity induction , consolidation maintenance patient . - Test whether gene expression profile assess prior treatment predictive resistance remission induction chemotherapy correlate detectable minimal residual disease post-consolidation therapy . ( Only one patient molecular remission receive consolidation . Therefore , predictive value pre-treatment gene expression profile could determine report ) . - Investigate preliminarily manner outcomes patient fail achieve maintain PCR-negative PML-RARα fusion gene consolidation therapy treat gemtuzumab ozogamicin . ( Only one patient treat gemtuzumab ozogamicin part protocol treatment . Therefore , result objective report ) . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive oral tretinoin twice daily morphologic complete remission ( CR ) maximum 90 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive cytarabine IV continuously day 3-9 daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 3-6 . - Consolidation therapy : Patients achieve CR , CR incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) , partial remission ( PR ) induction therapy receive arsenic trioxide IV 2 hour 5 day week 5 week . After 2-week rest period , patient receive second course arsenic trioxide . Within 14-30 day blood count recovery , patient receive oral tretinoin twice daily day 1-7 daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 . Patients receive second course tretinoin daunorubicin hydrochloride adequate blood count recovery . - Post-consolidation therapy : Patients achieve molecular CR ( CRm ) , achieve CR CRi still PML-RARα-positive consolidation therapy , receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV 2 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course PML-RARα-negative PCR . ( close 8/15/10 ) Patients stratify accord age ( 18 60 year vs &gt; 60 year ) , acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) risk group ( low v intermediate ) , patient receive consolidation therapy course 3 4 ( yes v ) regardless CRm response . These patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ( Randomization observation arm close 8/15/10 ) All patient non-randomly assigned receive post-consolidation therapy . - Arm I : Beginning 14-30 day blood count recovery , patient receive oral tretinoin twice daily day 1-7 , oral mercaptopurine daily day 1-14 , oral methotrexate day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 1 year . - Arm II : Patients receive chemotherapy . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year . ( Randomization observation arm close 8/15/10 ) Patients undergo blood collection periodically cytogenetic study . Samples analyze PML-RARα fusion gene via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay gene expression profile . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
