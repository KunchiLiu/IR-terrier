	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study radiation therapy cisplatin see well work compare radiation therapy alone treat patient endometrial cancer come back . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give radiation therapy together cisplatin effective radiation therapy alone treat patient endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Cisplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether pelvic radiation therapy concurrent cisplatin promise respect progression-free survival pelvic radiation therapy alone treatment recurrent uterine carcinoma limit pelvis vagina . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To capture site recurrence subsequent treatment pelvic radiation without concurrent weekly cisplatin woman recurrent uterine carcinoma . II . To estimate overall survival patient recurrent uterine carcinoma treat pelvic radiation therapy without concurrent weekly cisplatin . III . To estimate prognostic significance location ( central pelvis versus vagina ) size recurrence , addition prognostic significance salvage set histological subtype , grade , patient age , race , performance status , presence lymph-vascular space involvement original tumor time initial hysterectomy . IV . To evaluate toxicity derive combined cisplatin radiation compare radiation alone patient population . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) pelvis daily day 1-5 5 week . After completion EBRT , patient undergo intracavitary low-dose rate high-dose rate brachytherapy* low-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy* . ARM II : Patients undergo EBRT Arm I receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . Patients undergo brachytherapy* Arm I . NOTE : *IMRT boost allow patient candidate brachytherapy . IMRT may also use entire course therapy treatment whole pelvis and/or boost patient undergoing brachytherapy . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
