	<brief_title>Study Cetuximab With Radiation Followed Consolidation Chemotherapy NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II study determine overall survival patient locally advance NSCLC treat cetuximab concurrent thoracic radiotherapy follow consolidation chemotherapy paclitaxel/carboplatin/cetuximab . This multicenter study include 36 subject male female , great 18 year age . All subject initially receive radiation cetuximab . Radiation give day ( Monday-Friday ) approximately 6-8 week . During course radiation , cetuximab give intravenously week . Approximately 4-6 week last radiation dose , subject treat chemotherapy , paclitaxel/carboplatin . Chemotherapy give intravenously every 3 week 3 cycle ( 1 cycle=3 week ) . Cetuximab intravenous administration continue throughout entire study , week week 26 include chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer Patients must surgically unresectable stage IIIA disease stage IIIB disease without malignant pleural/pericardial effusion Patients must measurable disease per RECIST criterion , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 9.2 evaluation measurable disease . Age &gt; 18 year . Lung cancer extremely rare child . ECOG performance status 01 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % ; see Appendix A ) . If available , tumor tissue submit EGFR status IHC correlative study . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/μL platelet &gt; 100,000/μL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal The effect cetuximab develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason EGFR inhibitor , chemotherapeutic agent radiation therapy , well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients must either child bear potential negative pregnancy test within 7 day treatment . Patients consider child bear potential surgically sterile ( undergone hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Willingness sign approve informed consent . Patients receive prior chest radiation therapy . Patients history pulmonary fibrosis exclude study . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition carboplatin , paclitaxel , cetuximab agent use study . History cancer NSCLC ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix ) within last five year . Prior therapy know specific inhibitor EGFR . History severe allergic reaction prior therapy monoclonal antibody Peripheral neuropathy grade 1 severity Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ie . uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study carboplatin , paclitaxel , cetuximab radiation therapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent use study . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction carboplatin , paclitaxel cetuximab agent administer study . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Active hepatitis . History pulmonary fibrosis .</criteria>
