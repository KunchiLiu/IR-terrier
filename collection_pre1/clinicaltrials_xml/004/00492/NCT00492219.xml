	<brief_title>Postoperative Function Following Partial Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ask brief medical history may determine he/she participate study . If patient go partial knee replacement , he/she randomly assign receive either fixed-bearing ( Vanguard M , Biomet , Warsaw , IN ) mobile-bearing ( Oxford , Biomet , Warsaw , IN ) partial knee replacement . Both implant system FDA approve Dr. Christensen equally skilled system . The fixed-bearing partial knee replacement make polished metal piece cement femur metal piece cement tibia . The plastic portion fixed-bearing partial knee replacement attach tibial metal tray move . The mobile-bearing knee replacement also metal piece cement femur tibia , two metal piece small plastic piece move knee bend straightens . Patients equal opportunity receive either implant system . If patient total knee replacement , surgery he/she participate study , except collect information patient office visit ask patient perform functional test . If participant one healthy volunteer , he/she knee surgery ask perform functional test . Information collect office visit : A member research team ask patient series question knee . Patients ask answer series question total 4 time course 1 year . Also , record well patient bend straighten knee 4 office visit . We patient rate pain knee ask satisfy surgery . If patient complication , also record . Patients X-rays take knee follow-up visit . This normal routine follow knee replacement . The X-rays read surgeon help determine success surgery . We also ask patient perform 3 functional test office visit . These 3 test perform raise platform approximately 2 inch floor . For first test , patient ask stand still knees straight two second , ask stand still knees bent 45 degree two second . For second test , patient ask stand seat position . For third test , patient ask step onto four-inch wooden box step back onto platform . Prior test , patient allow practice test many time necessary he/she feel comfortable . During test , investigator help make sure patient able safely properly perform 3 repetition test . We ask patient perform one functional test unable perform test without constant use arm support .</detailed_description>
