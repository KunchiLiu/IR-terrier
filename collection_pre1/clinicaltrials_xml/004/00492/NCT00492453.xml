	<brief_title>Spinal Versus General Anesthesia Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy regional anesthesia alone report occasionally past ; report include patient unfit receive general anesthesia , mainly patient severe chronic obstructive airway disease . Regional anesthesia use laparoscopy fit patient almost exclusively combination general anesthesia , order extend analgesic effect early postoperative period . Surprisingly , era minimally invasive medicine , regional anesthesia gain popularity , routinely used sole method anesthesia laparoscopic procedure . It generally accept laparoscopic procedure merely change access still require general anesthetic ; hence difference conventional surgery likely small . This statement predominantly base assumption laparoscopy necessitates endotracheal intubation prevent aspiration respiratory embarrassment secondary induction CO2 pneumoperitoneum turn well tolerate patient awake procedure . However , surprising regional anesthesia successfully use laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient unfit procedure general anesthesia , tested fit patient , presume risk would , theoretically , much low . We recently show pilot study feasibility perform successfully safely laparoscopic cholecystectomy low pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum spinal anesthesia alone , fit patient symptomatic gallstone disease . We also notice spinal anesthesia result exceptionally minimal postoperative pain . After pilot study , design control randomize trial order compare spinal anesthesia standard general anesthesia elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy fit patient .</detailed_description>
