	<brief_title>Varenicline Adjunctive Treatment Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo control clinical trial schizophrenia patient . Outcome measure include biomarkers clinical symptom function , smoke cessation . Neurobiological cognitive marker measure short term ( 2 week ) longer-term ( 8 week ) . Current schizophrenia treatment mostly ineffective primary negative symptom cognitive information process deficit associate disorder . Previous research identify several neurophysiological deficit schizophrenia enduring , frequently occur psychosis , mark disease liability . These schizophrenia endophenotypes provide important target novel treatment development represent core deficit disorder . We hypothesize sustained nicotinic dopaminergic modulation varenicline may ameliorate core neurobiological deficit see schizophrenia patient , would lead subsequent clinical improvement . Neurobiological neurocognitive marker clinical functional measure obtain determine 1 ) short-term effect varenicline biomarkers ; 2 ) longer-term improvement clinical symptom , smoke cessation , function ; biomarker change predict improvement .</detailed_description>
