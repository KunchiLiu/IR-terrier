	<brief_title>Treatement Extension Fractures Distal Radius</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal radius fracture numerous . Most time , people concern elderly old osteoporotic bone , important dorsal metaphysal comminution . The French reference treatment extension distal radius fracture , Kapandji method , turn less less performing treat complicate fracture . At moment , two point view opposition France . On one side , point view favour treatment intrafocal pinning : think able improve technique add trans-styloid pin stabilisation . On side , favour treatment use volar fixed-angle plating . The purpose study compare two type treatment use prospective randomize analysis . The main judging criterion lay X-ray assessment distal radius , try find loss reduction tree month . The secondary criterion lay fonctional score ( quickDASH Herzberg score ) 6 week , 3 month 6 month , well post-operative X-ray assessment order compare post-operative reduction distal radius fracture . All patient take emergency ward Limoges Hospital , suffer extension distal radius fracture ( intra extra articular accord Kapandji classification ) possibility participate study , want . The patient X-rayed operation , immobilization 3 week . Then cast remove , new X-rays take . Then patient allow perform daily activity . A new follow-up control take place 6 week later , include new series X-rays functional score . At point , people able start physiotherapy . New functional score X-ray assessment still take 3 6 month later . All X-rays analyzed orthopaedist , radiologist , radiological software . - Fonctional score ( quickDASH Herzberg score ) 6 week , 3 month 6 month . - X-ray assessment operation 3 week , 6 week , 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
