	<brief_summary>This study examine whether drug sildenafil low blood pressure pulmonary artery ( blood vessel lead heart lung ) patient sickle cell disease pulmonary hypertension ( high blood pressure lung ) . It see treatment reduce disease complication , shortness breath , pain crisis , pneumonia , increase survival . Patients 12 year age old sickle cell disease pulmonary hypertension may eligible study . Participants randomly assign receive sildenafil placebo ( sugar pill ) 16 week . Before start treatment , patient baseline study , include pregnancy test female childbearing age ; chest x-ray ; pulmonary function test measure much air patient breathe ; echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) ; 6-minute walk test measure exercise capacity ; quality-of-life assessment pain inventory . Patients moderate severe pulmonary hypertension undergo heart catheterization evaluate severity hypertension begin sildenafil therapy . During treatment , patient monitor follow : - Blood test : week 6 , 10 16 . - Echocardiogram : week 6 16 . - 6-minute walk test : week 6 , 10 16 . - Measurements weight , blood pressure heart rate : week 6 , 10 16 . - Pregnancy test woman childbearing age : week 6 , 10 16 . - Pain questionnaire day week : week 6 1.0 - Quality-of-life questionnaire : week 16 . - Heart catheterization : week 16 patient moderate severe hypertension . At end 16-week period , patient may opt continue receive sildenafil monitor open-label phase study 1 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) autosomal recessive disorder common genetic disease affect African-Americans . Approximately 0.15 percent African-Americans homozygous sickle cell disease , 8 percent sickle cell trait . Acute pain crisis , acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) , pulmonary hypertension common complication sickle cell anemia . Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) identify marker mortality adult sickle cell disease . Sildenafil proven beneficial pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) recent phase I/II study intramural National Institutes Health ( NIH ) suggest well tolerate efficacious SCD population . Furthermore , number recent study suggest nitric oxide ( NO ) base therapy may favorable impact sickle red cell molecular level could improve abnormal microvascular perfusion characteristic sickle cell anemia . The project 3 distinct component : 1 . Screening Phase . Approximately 1000 subject sickle cell disease screen . Assessments include historical laboratory data , Doppler echocardiogram , 6-minute walk test , plasma/serum , DNA banking . 2 . Main Interventional Trial . The randomized , double-blind , placebo control phase design determine effect 16 week Sildenafil therapy exercise endurance , cardiopulmonary hemodynamic parameter symptoms patient population . The open-label follow-up phase design provide additional year Sildenafil therapy subject complete randomized , double-blind phase . 3 . Observational Follow-up Study . Screened patient qualify participation main interventional trial may contact every 6-12 month 3 year assess major disease-related complication , include mortality .</detailed_description>
