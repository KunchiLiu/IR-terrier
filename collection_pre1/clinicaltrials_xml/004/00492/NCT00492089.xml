	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Reducing CNS Side Effects Patients Who Have Undergone Radiation Therapy Brain Primary Brain Tumor , Meningioma , Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine extent bevacizumab reduce active radiation toxicity CNS patient undergone cranial irradiation primary brain neoplasm , meningioma , head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine extent drug reduce dexamethasone dependence patient . II . Determine extent drug improve neurologic function patient . III . Determine extent drug improve quality life patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover , double-blind study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm II fail respond treatment 6 12 week may cross arm I receive 2 course bevacizumab arm I . Patients arm I ( include crossover patient ) respond treatment may receive 2 additional course bevacizumab . Patients undergo MRI course 2 4 . Quality life neurologic function assess baseline , periodically study treatment , 12 24 week completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 24 week .</detailed_description>
