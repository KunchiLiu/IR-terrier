	<brief_title>FCR Bevacizumab Treatment Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During study , 6 `` cycle '' treatment . A cycle make treatment study drug 3-4 day 3-1/2 week ( 25 day ) treatment ( 4 week total ) . Treatment study drug give 4 day row first cycle , 3 day row Cycles 2-6 . On Day 1 cycle , receive rituximab needle vein . On Cycle 1 , since first exposure rituximab , must give slowly , may take 6-8 hour complete . On cycle , give rapidly , 3-4 hour . Cyclophosphamide fludarabine give separately needle vein Days 2-4 Cycle 1 Days 1-3 Cycles 2-6 . Cyclophosphamide fludarabine give 30 minute . Bevacizumab give needle vein 90 minute Day 3 Cycle 1 . If well tolerate , next dose Bevacizumab give 60 minute Day 2 Cycle 2 . If Cycle 2 dose well tolerate , next dos Bevacizumab give 30 minute Day 2 Cycles 2-6 . In addition study drug , may also give fluid vein help flush kidney , help prevent possible kidney damage . You may receive 6 cycle treatment . Treatment give outpatient basis .
