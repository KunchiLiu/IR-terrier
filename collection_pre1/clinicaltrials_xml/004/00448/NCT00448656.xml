	<brief_title>Treatment Atrial Fibrillation Minimal Invasive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation major health problem.Despite adequate treatment underlie heart disease , rhythm control unsuccessful almost half patient , also patient lone atrial fibrillation.If patient remain highly symptomatic , non-pharmacological approach may consider include pulmonary vein isolation Cox maze III surgery . Maze III surgery high succes rate , however include major cardiac surgery substantial risk complication . New surgical strategy symptomatic lone atrial fibrillation focus minimal invasive off-pump procedure omit cardiopulmonary bypass ( thus lower complication rate ) , take advantage easy approach ablation site short procedure time . Epicardial surgical ablation isolate pulmonary vein high intensity focus ultrasound perform off-pump Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery ( VATS ) may promise treatment option . In pilot study , aim study feasibility new surgical ablation approach patient lone atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Documented symptomatic lone paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation , either convert spontaneously terminate antiarrhythmic drug electrical cardioversion . 2 . The patient least one episode persistent atrial fibrillation three episode paroxysmal atrial fibrillation last three month . 3 . Duration present episode persistent atrial fibrillation less one year . 4 . The patient treat least two different antiarrhythmic drug ( class IIV ) least one belong class I III . 5 . The patient sign date write informed consent prior study participation . 1 . Age &lt; 18 &gt; 76 year . 2 . Contraindications oral anticoagulation . 3 . Signs sick sinus syndrome AV conduction disturbance ( i.e . symptomatic bradycardia asystole &gt; 3 second escape rate &lt; 40 beat per minute awake symptomfree patient ) . 4 . Permanent atrial fibrillation define atrial fibrillation continuously present convertible sinus rhythm electrical cardioversion antiarrhythmic drug . 5 . Previous transvenous pulmonary vein isolation , Maze surgery , cardiac surgery . 6 . Heart failure define NYHA class IIIIV heart failure . 7 .
