	<brief_title>MRI Targeted Focal Laser Thermal Therapy Biopsy Confirmed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , single arm , open-label Phase I study establish safety interstitial laser thermal therapy ( ILTT ) patient single site low grade ( Gleason &lt; 7 ) prostate cancer yet receive treatment cancer . No control group utilize patient receive laser thermal therapy . The patient undergo multimode MRI determine single site prostate cancer localize technique localize tumor 3 dimension within prostate . A multicore ( 12 + core ) map transrectal ultrasound guide biopsy prostate would confirm site cancer exist . Each patient complete quality life performance questionnaire . ILLT perform general anesthetic procedure similar brachytherapy , use transrectal ultrasound guide insertion laser monitoring probe sector contain cancer visualize MR scan . Following procedure , patient assess clinical sign urinary , rectal , erectile complication complete validate self-assessment tool function . MRI 7 day MRI biopsy 6 month use assess extent tissue effect presence cancer due ILTT . Patients remain standard Watchful Waiting surveillance sign disease progression . ILLT restrict future treatment prostate cancer . To minimize treatment risk , participant trial stag accord location disease prostate . The first 3 participant recruit trial target loci well separated urethra , erectile nerve rectum , treatment region pose minimal risk injury vital structure . Lesions size measured initial stage use plan fiber placement three remain stage , fiber placement closer critical structure urethra ( Stage 2 ) , erectile nerve ( Stage 3 ) rectum ( Stage 4 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men &gt; 18 year age ; Histologicallyproven prostate carcinoma ; Prostate cancer clinical stage T1c Only one sector prostate demonstrate prostate cancer 1 core positive Gleason score &lt; 7 ; Each core must range 10 50 % adenocarcinoma . Prostate MRI must confirm area suspicious cancer sector positive biopsy ; A minimum six ( 6 ) week prostate biopsy Inclusion Visit ; Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level Â£ 10 ng/mL PORPUS , IPSS , IIEF complete prior procedure Prostate volume &lt; 60 cc measure ultra sound ; Uroflow &gt; 12 cc/sec post void residual &lt; 100 cc . Life expectancy great 5 year , base comorbidity relate prostate cancer . Patients follow exclusion criterion exclude study participation : Patients unwilling unable give inform consent ; Patients foci location Apex prostate isolate transition zone cancer Patients receive androgen suppression therapy Patients receive receive chemotherapy prostate carcinoma ; Patients previously treat surgery prostate ( traditional , endoscopic minimally invasive include HIFU , TUNA , RITA , microwave , TURP , cryotherapy curative treatment Patients whose undergone radiation therapy prostate cancer Any condition , history illness surgery , opinion Investigator , might confound result study pose additional risk patient ( e.g . significant cardiovascular condition allergy ) ; Patients history non compliance medical therapy and/or medical recommendation ; Patients unwilling unable complete patient selfassessment questionnaire ; Myocardial infarction , transient ischemic attack stroke , within 6 month prior study , Unstable uncontrolled angina , uncontrolled heart failure , serious uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia Chronic acute prostititis , neuroginic bladder , urinary tract infection , sphincter abnormality , symptom prevents normal micturition . Patients participate clinical study and/or receive treatment investigational treatment and/or product within past 90 day ; All medication cause decrease clotting , vasoconstriction platelet aggregation , must stop prior treatment . History Colon Cancer Colon Surgery preform If patient unable undergo anesthesia Patients contraindication MRI ( i.e . pacemaker , hip prosthesis , severe claustrophobia , brain aneurysm clip , allergy MRI contrast agent ) . Any condition , history illness , opinion investigator confound increase patient risk study</criteria>
