	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death American men . Hormonal ablation , form medical surgical castration cornerstone management metastatic prostate cancer however , treatment option patient androgen ablation fails limit . Second-line hormonal agent generally associate low response rate document survival benefit . Historically , chemotherapy consider significant activity hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPCa ) . This view change within past 10 year , partly availability prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) measurement monitor tumor burden . Although seem chemotherapy , either single agent combination agent may lead clinical response , reduction PSA measurement , pain control , improve quality life , benefit overall survival definitively proven . The current standard care treatment metastatic prostate cancer hormone therapy ( androgen blockade ) .3,4 When strategy longer effective , good treatment option leave . For reason , prostate cancer research aim identify new therapeutic modality increase impact parameter well prolong patient survival . A total 24 men prostate cancer range non-metastatic rise PSA disease bony metastatic disease enrol study . All patient fail androgen treatment least one prior taxane chemotherapy refuse chemotherapy . Out 24 patient , 12 patient treat use TroVax® 12 treat use TroVax® plus GM-CSF .</detailed_description>
