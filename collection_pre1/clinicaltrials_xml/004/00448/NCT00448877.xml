	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether new brain function monitor distinguish anesthetize awake patient . The device implement utilizes functional near-infrared ( fNIR ) technology detect anesthesia depth well reaction stimulus surgical procedure . After obtain consent device place across forehead patient . A baseline signal obtain prior induction . The fNIR signal continuously record throughout procedure . Key event well administration drug record order observe change signal trend . Neither device light emit hazardous patient - risk discomfort involve .</brief_summary>
