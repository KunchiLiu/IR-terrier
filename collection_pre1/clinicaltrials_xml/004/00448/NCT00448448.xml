	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) structural curve spine clear underlying cause . Bracing currently standard care prevent curve progression treat AIS . However , effectiveness bracing remain unclear . The purpose study compare risk curve progression adolescent AIS wear brace versus determine whether reliable factor predict usefulness bracing particular individual AIS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bracing Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial ( BrAIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIS characterize lateral curvature spine great 10 degree plus rotation spinal vertebra . AIS find adolescent age 10 time skeletal maturity . Progression spinal curve 50 degree suggest high risk continue curve progression throughout adulthood usually indicate need spinal fusion surgery . Only 10 percent adolescent AIS end curve progress require surgical intervention . While certain risk factor curve progression identify , reliable way estimate likelihood needing surgery . Bracing currently standard care treat AIS . However , effectiveness bracing remain unclear , unknown adolescent particular may benefit bracing . Therefore , adolescent undergo brace without know likelihood avoid surgery . The purpose study compare risk curve progression adolescent AIS wear brace versus determine whether reliable factor predict usefulness bracing particular individual AIS . The study also evaluate best dose duration schedule brace affect quality life , functioning , psychosocial adjustment among participant . Participation study last participant reach skeletal maturity spinal curve progress 50 degree , usual care continue . Participants either 1 ) randomly assign treatment 2 ) may decline randomization choose treatment arm . Study visit occur every 6 month orthopaedic surgeon 's office include x-ray , clinical exam , questionnaire . Participants assign brace instruct wear brace least 18 hour per day . Temperature monitor place brace use determine actual wear time participant .</detailed_description>
