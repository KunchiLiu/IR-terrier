	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) 10 healthy control recruit participate study . Healthy control examined ensure evidence neurodegenerative change include cognitive decline . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects ask undergo bolus injection 123-I AV83 . Subjects undergo serial SPECT imaging scan serial venous plasma sample measurement 123-I AV83 plasma ( protein bound free ) period 6 hour . Subjects may ask undergo second image visit 2 6 week follow initial image visit follow similar procedure initial image visit evaluate reproducibility image measure use procedure . The imaging analyse perform image-processing specialist remain masked procedure employ image acquisition . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , 123-I AV83 . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result AD patient control compare . For subject undergo repeat image visit , data initial scan compare second scan determine offer reproducibility image outcome measure .</detailed_description>
