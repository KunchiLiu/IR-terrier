	<brief_summary>Dementing syndrome , part , incurable . People dementia become highly dependent frequently move home residential age care facility . Medications aim reduce severity number symptom associate different type dementia modest success . Increasingly , people dementia , family carers turn supplementary alternative approach management symptom . There many publish report describe successful use music therapy reduce severity many symptom dementia . These include report improved memory , improve language skill , reduce anxiety depression , reduction agitation disruptive behaviour well social relationship family , peer carers . However , quality evidence provide part fail meet standard evidence require health care provider . This clinical trial examine effect music therapy intervention . The study recruit 180 patient sub-acute hospital ward . Participants randomly place group receive either occupational therapy music therapy . Before therapy program begin , use questionnaire measure memory function , language ability , orientation mood . We also record brain activity surface scalp , blood pressure pulse examine physiological response . The measure repeat 3 week therapy determine whether improvement symptom participant whether group music therapy show great improvement group occupational therapy . We make video record one therapy session allow u observe level engagement ass change facial expression . This provide information immediate effect music mood social interaction . The information collect brain activity blood pressure help u understand music therapy might bring change symptom dementia . This understanding useful develop good application music therapy .

	<brief_title>Evaluating Effects Music Interventions Hospitalised People With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Dementia present significant health problem throughout world . We compare effect music therapy intervention occupational therapy intervention randomise control trial conduct hospitalised old people dementia . The study employ physiological , psychometric observer-rated measure monitor change time range parameter include cognitive behavioural response , mood agitation , CNS function , facial expression blood pressure . The battery psychometric instrument consist well-validated reliable measure . Cognitive status measure use The Mini-Mental State Exam ( Folstein et al , 1975 ) Hierarchic Dementia Scale ( Cole Dastoor , 1996 ) Mood assess use Geriatric Depression Scale ( Yesavage et al. , 1983 ) . A wide range behaviour assess Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( CMAI ) ( Cohen-Mansfield , J. , 1986 ) . To monitor change relate music non-music intervention , employ EEG method detect change dementia-related generalised , global slowing EEG well localise change site anterior posterior region cerebral hemisphere . EEG-coherence method use assess intrahemispheric interhemispheric functional interaction . We also record auditory evoke potential evaluate change attentional status participant . This provide data detect change time response intervention . The Facial Activation Coding System ( Ekman &amp; Friesen , 1978 ) allow systematic analysis facial expression video-taped recording . It use people dementia provide valid reliable quantitative estimate pain state ( Hadjistavropoulos et al. , 2000 ) . It employ quantitatively evaluate change facial expression occur intervention session . This allow u observe within group change group difference range expressive response . Changes blood pressure provide mean evaluate physiological response intervention . AIMS : The primary aim present study determine whether symptomatic improvement attribute music therapy support empirical evidence derive battery psychometric observational measure . A second aim determine whether neurophysiological measure ( EEG frequency , EEG-coherence , EP ) vascular activity ( blood pressure ) reflect central nervous system autonomic change directly correlate reduction dementia-related symptom . Specifically , study investigate follow hypothesis – 1 . Music employed therapeutic medium reduce symptomatic cognitive , behavioural , emotional functional deficit associate dementia . 2 . Symptomatic change correlate physiological change . METHODOLOGY : This study take advantage establish collaborative network Department Psychiatry , The University Melbourne , The National Ageing Research Institute , The Cognitive , Dementia Memory Service ( CDAMS ) The Royal Melbourne Hospital CDAMS St George ’ Hospital campus St Vincent ’ Health . The research team cover several discipline include aged psychiatry , neuropsychiatry , geriatric medicine , neuropsychology , behavioural neuroscience , electrophysiology , music music therapy . SUBJECTS : One hundred eighty sub-acute patient mild , moderate severe dementia recruit RMH ( Royal Park Campus ) St Georges Hospital period 18 month . There potential pool approximately 800 patient plan 18 month data collection period . We anticipate ineligibility 30 % , attrition rate 20-25 % time lose holiday participation rate 70 % , total cohort approximately 260 , leave substantial redundancy number require power study . Testing commence patient settle one week majority illness stabilise medication adjust . A full medical assessment available participant order evaluate medical comorbidity , cognitive status dementia diagnosis . This information include result physical examination , blood test , Ct scan , informant history neuropsychological assessment include administration MMSE ( Folstein et al . 1975 ) classification accord DSM-IV , ICD-10 NINCDS-ARDRA criterion , current research gold standard dementia diagnosis ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) . Consensus diagnosis information available make clinician involve study . Primary diagnosis , comorbidities medication monitor . Recruitment undertaken accordance procedure approve The Mental Health Research Ethics Committee , Melbourne Health Network , St Vincent ’ Health Research Ethics Committee . Given nature participant ’ diagnosis , recognise give inform consent . PROCEDURE : Participants randomly assign either music intervention group control ( occupational therapy ) group . Both group undertake three 50 minute intervention session per week three week give total nine intervention . Each session conduct group 4 - 6 participant . Pre post measure make day prior therapy session day last therapy session . These measure follow : - EEG record make yield slow/fast ratio data rest state music-listening EEG-coherence data auditory evoke potential data . - Four blood pressure pulse reading take hourly interval establish mean baseline . - Questionnaires - Mini Mental State Examination , Hierarchic Dementia Scale , Geriatric Depression Scale administer prior first intervention session ninth intervention session . Pre post test involve take approximately 90 minute total . Video recording make use two camera fifth therapy session . The first camera locate tripod whole group , include therapist , continuously frame facilitate subsequent observation participation social interaction . The second camera hand hold take film face participant session subsequent cod change facial expression use Facial Activation Coding System . Further information compile member research team . This information , use monitor comorbid condition pre post change , derive patient record . It collect follow instrument - The Clinical Dementia rating Scale ( Hughes et al , 1982 ) - The Barthel Index ( Mahoney Barthel , 1965 ) - The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( Linn et al 1968 ) . - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( Cummings , 1997 ) Finally , The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( Weiner et al , 1998 ) administer pre post intervention researcher consultation nursing staff . In addition measure , full range treatment outside music therapy intervention receive participant group document . This enable researcher monitor level therapist contact experienced participant music therapy control group . It also provide data may use covariates number statistical analysis . INCLUSION CRITERIA : People clinical diagnosis dementia currently sub-acute age care hospital ward ; EXCLUSION CRITERIA : delirium ; acute medical condition ( eg pneumonia cardiac failure ) likely participation contra-indicated ; primary psychiatric condition ; severe hearing impairment ; RANDOMISATION PROCEDURES : A stratified randomization procedure use ensure experimental control group least broadly homogeneous respect cognitive status . The procedure apply separately within two hospital facility allocation make progressively people enter study . After consent acquire pre-intervention measure take , participant cod , stratify two level accord MMSE score allocate treatment group accord computer generate random sequence . The sequence generate use research randomiser , online web-based program ( http : //www.randomizer.org/form.htm ) . The person responsible implement allocation sequence either member hospital staff NARI staff member involvement aspect study . That person responsible de-identifying participant use conventional coding system . Baseline post-intervention data collection procedure administer person role project procedures remain blind treatment allocation . Baseline test take place allocation . As contact participant intervention procedure patient identification cod independent person , blind maintain . As added protection , psychometric instrument ( MMSE , HDS GDS ) assess assessor participant . That , Assessor A administer instrument Participant A baseline testing , Assessor B administer instrument post-intervention Participant A . This avoid unintended prior knowledge individual participant performance help ensure post-treatment blinding respect active versus control group assignment . The instrument use clear establish implementation procedure high inter-rater reliability . After post-intervention assessment take participant , assessor ask nominate group think participant . A simple statistical analysis able detect whether significant bias group assignment whether assignment good chance . Bias may arise , example , one treatment group outcome strongly differentiate other.. It note , potential stratification factor ( eg age , gender , diagnosis ) , use factor rapidly become unfeasible . Because current cognitive status prognostic relevance , particularly regard music therapy , decide use measure sole stratification factor . STATISTICAL ANALYSES : Given multiple dependent variable monitor study , MANOVA use test between-group difference post-hoc univariate comparison require . Based previous study NARI refer use similar measure expect 90 subject per group detect 25 % change mean value least 80 % power ( alpha .05 ) . For test-retest data , two way repeat measure MANOVA ( group , time ) use examine change duration intervention , group effect interaction factor . Bivariate correlation multiple regression analysis use explore relationship various measure ( EEG , FACS , MMSE , HDS , self-report observational measure ) . Similar comparison also make change score within domain parameter ( objective , psychometric , self-report ) way co-vary time .</detailed_description>
