	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn effect inhale dust mite allergen extract airway response allergic individual mild asthma . Information learn study use identify safe dose range D Farinae extract use inhalation challenge study . This study also help determine inhalation allergen affect mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) measure quickly mucus clear airway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dust Mite Inhalation Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-blinded study effect inhale house dust mite ( D Farinae ) allergen extract airway response , principal endpoint decrease FEV1 15 % within 10 minute inhalation one sequence dose allergen compare measurement obtain immediately prior challenge . These dos deliver 5 inhalation allergen concentration 0.25 , 0.50 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 4.0 , 8.0 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 125 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 AU/mL . Allergen challenge often induce immediate late phase decrease lung function . The immediate phase occur within 10 minute , often self resolve associate release histamine airway mast cell , late phase response often occur 2 8 hour later associate increase airway inflammation . During subject 's baseline visit occur least 2 day prior allergen challenge , measure mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) inhale , radiolabeled particle gamma scintigraphy . The subject return 24 hour later follow-up scan sputum sample also collect . At 4 hour post allergen challenge , measure MCC exploratory endpoint . It expect mucociliary clearance depress part late phase reaction allergen challenge . Twenty-four hour allergen challenge , induce sputum obtain compare sputum sample obtain baseline visit . Exploratory endpoint interest examination induce sputum also collect inhaled allergen challenge . Observation Schedule ( detail regard study procedure follow ) : Baseline visit 1 . Consent obtain 2. Review subject 's medical history current medication 3 . Vital sign measurement ( temperature , pulse , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , oxygen saturation , symptom score 4 . Urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential 5 . Spirometry 6 . Physical exam ear , nose , throat chest 7 . Xenon equilibrium gas scan 8 . Mucociliary clearance procedure ( MCC ) 24 hour post baseline visit 1. Review change medical status prior 24 hour 2 . Vital sign , oxygen saturation symptom score 3 . Follow MCC scan 4 . Sputum induction Post Challenge Observations/Reporting Subjects contact phone call follow-up 24 hour sputum induction ( see accompany phone script ) 24-48 hour prior challenge visit ( least 2 day baseline visit ) 1. Review change medical status since last visit 2 . Vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score 3 . Spirometry 4 . Physical exam ear , nose , throat chest Allergen challenge day 1. Review change medical status since last visit 2 . Vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score 3 . Urine pregnancy test 4 . Spirometry 5 . If measure acceptable , allergen challenge perform described 6 . Post-challenge monitoring interval indicate study worksheet 7 . Four hour post challenge , subject MCC evaluate 8 . Overnight stay UNC General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Subjects instructed perform either spirometry personal spirometer peak flow assessment every hourly basis least 9 pm , 11 pm subject awake . 24 hour post challenge 1 . Subject discharge GCRC , accompany study staff member , proceeds directly CEMALB . 2 . Vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score 3 . Spirometry 4 . Follow-up MCC scan 5 . Sputum induction Post Challenge Observations/Reporting 1 . Subjects contact phone call follow-up 24 hour post-challenge sputum induction ( see accompany phone script ) 2 . Each volunteer give symptom score sheet day 96 hour ( 4 day ) challenge ( see accompany symptom score sheet ) Study discontinuation visit within 10 day final challenge dose : 1 . Vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score 2 . Spirometry 3 . If finding abnormal , medical evaluation direct study physician undertaken</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . A history episodic wheezing , chest tightness , shortness breath consistent asthma , physician diagnose asthma . 2 . Specific allergy house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae confirm positive immediate skin test response . 3 . Provocative concentration methacholine 10 mg/ml less produce 20 % fall FEV1 ( PC20 methacholine ) method use separate screening protocol ( 98CEMLB293 ) already approve UNC IRB . 4 . FEV1 least 80 % predict FEV1/FVC ratio least .70 ( without use bronchodilating medication 12 hour ) , consistent lung function person mild episodic mild persistent asthma . 1 . Any chronic medical condition consider PI contraindication exposure study include significant cardiovascular disease , diabetes require medication , chronic renal disease , chronic thyroid disease . 2 . Subjects history immunologic disease , undergo therapeutic immune suppression cancer diseases . 3 . Physician direct emergency treatment asthma exacerbation within precede 12 month . 4 . Use systemic steroid therapy within precede 12 month asthma follow asthma symptom ; cough , wheeze , shortness breath . 5 . Use inhaled steroid , cromolyn leukotriene inhibitor ( Montelukast Zafirlukast ) within past month ( except use cromolyn exclusively prior exercise ) . 6 . Use daily theophylline within past month . 7 . Use medication might alter response methacholine antigen challenge include antiinflammatory antihistamine agent within one week challenge . 8 . Subjects use tricyclic antidepressant doxepin MAO inhibitor . 9 . Subjects use betaadrenergic blocker medication know interfere treatment anaphylaxis . 10 . Inability withhold inhaled oral bronchodilating medication 12 hour prior allergen challenge . 11 . Pregnancy ( positive urine pregnancy test baseline visit ) nursing baby . Pregnant woman exclude due risk fetal exposure radiation . 12 . Women child bear potential use dependable contraception ( birth control pill , IUD , estrogen patch ) completely abstinent . 13 . Cigarette smoke &gt; 0.5 pack per week within past 12 month . 14 . Nighttime symptom cough wheeze great 1x/week baseline ( clearly recognize viral induced asthma exacerbation ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . 15 . Exacerbation asthma 2x/week would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . 16 . Daily requirement albuterol due asthma symptom ( cough , wheeze , chest tightness ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . ( Not include prophylactic use albuterol prior exercise ) . 17 . Viral upper respiratory tract infection within 4 week challenge . 18 . Any acute infection require antibiotic within 2 week challenge ( 4 week case azithromycin due prolonged halflife ) . 19 . Participating study utilizing investigational agent within 4 week challenge .</criteria>
