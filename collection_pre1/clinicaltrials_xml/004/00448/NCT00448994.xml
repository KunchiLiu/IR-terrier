	<brief_summary>This study design determine rate stem cell transplant patient develop infection cause group virus , know adenovirus , common fungi . Stem cell unspecialized cell , capable produce stem cell specialized cell , use replace damage diseased cell . The study conduct child ( 2-17years old ) transplant stem cell donor . Patients undergoing stem cell transplantation likely develop infection immune system weaken . Blood , stool , urine throat swab sample collect ( least 100 day weekly basis ) detect infection ( ) cause adenovirus fungus .

	<detailed_description>This study multi-center observational study determine usefulness real time PCR detection adenovirus fungal infection patient follow HSCT . Quantitative viral load monitoring evaluate establish correlation clinical symptom measure effectiveness therapeutic intervention . Samples collect prior HSCT schedule weekly basis 100 day post-HSCT patient show sign infection . Patients ' sign symptom outcomes record correlation viral load . In addition , viral culture perform schedule PCR assay use 3 sample ( throat swab , stool , urine ) . The study conduct approximately 6 center United States .</detailed_description>
