	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial RAD001 Plus Nexavar Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant progress understand biology renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , estimate 35 , 000 people United States diagnose approximately 12 , 000 die disease 2005 . Renal cell carcinoma presently rank tenth lead cause cancer death constitute 3 % solid neoplasm . In contrast many malignancy , treatment RCC limit . Treatment remain highly difficult perplexing challenge due resistance chemotherapy hormone therapy limit response cytokine . Despite recent advance fundamental knowledge RCC biology development molecular therapeutic , clinical research require best guide use excite new agent combination regimen . The combination RAD001 Nexavar® , current clinical trial minimal toxicity , represent treatment regimen investigate tolerance toxicity well initial phase II efficacy . The study design evaluate MTD . Following completion phase I , utilize MTD , Phase II study design evaluate anti-tumor activity .</detailed_description>

Previous therapy may include prior single agent exposure RAD001 Nexavar® . Four week must elapse previous therapy . Phase II : No one prior systemic and/or investigative therapy kind MRCC . Four week must elapse previous therapy . Phase II : Previous therapy may include RAD001 Nexavar® . Phase II : Patients primary tumor place strongly encourage undergo nephrectomy prior initiation study agent . Phase II : Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit .

Patients preexist thyroid abnormality whose thyroid function maintain normal range medication ineligible . No uncontrolled psychiatric disorder . Patients delay heal wound , ulcer , and/or bone fracture eligible . Patients 'currently active ' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer eligible . Patients consider 'currently active ' malignancy complete anticancer therapy consider physician less 30 % risk relapse . Pregnant woman exclude All fertile patient must use adequate contraception ( barrier method ) study three month thereafter . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , severe infection , severe malnutrition , ventricular arrhythmia , chronic liver renal disease , active upper GI tract ulceration ) . A known history HIV seropositivity . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) .</criteria>
