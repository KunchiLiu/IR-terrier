	<brief_title>EndoTAG-1 Triple Receptor Negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer still major public health problem worldwide , far frequent neoplasm woman . In recent year so-called `` profile breast cancer '' expression array become common suggest result allow individualization care . Breast cancer may subclassified luminal , basal , HER-2 subtypes distinct difference prognosis response therapy . About 80 % basal-like-breast cancer possess so-called `` triple-receptor-negative '' phenotype . Patients `` triple receptor negative breast cancer '' complete absence hormone receptor incl . HER-2 , aggressive clinical course paucity treatment option . The therapeutic option chemotherapy respect choice cytostatic agent limit . Against background , study try find another therapeutic option combine vascular-disrupting activity cytostatic effect paclitaxel study drug EndoTAG-1 . Comparison : EndoTAG-1 + paclitaxel ( combination therapy ) EndoTAG-1 ( monotherapy ) comparison paclitaxel ( control group )</detailed_description>
