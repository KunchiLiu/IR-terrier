	<brief_summary>This study use functional MRI ( fMRI , technique show area brain active performing different mental task ) , examine brain people functional movement disorder ( FMD ) may differ people without FMDs . People FMD movement symptom feel control due know medical disorder . Previous study look brain activity FMD patient find area frontal lobe brain appear overactive . These overactive area may make difficult perform complex mental task . Studying brain performance task may enhance knowledge FMD . Patients 18 year age old FMD healthy normal volunteer may eligible study . Participants two visit NIH Clinical Center follow procedure : First visit ( screen ) : - Medical history neurological examination . - Urine drug screen illicit drug . - Psychological testing , include interview questionnaire . Second visit : - Brain MRI ( one do NIH within past 12 month ) : MRI us magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . The subject lie table slide scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan process . The procedure last 2 hour , time patient ask lie still 30 minute time . - Brain fMRI : While MRI scanner , subject read question answer yes push button . They ask answer question health , movement symptom unrelated topic ( like personal preference current event ) . The question vary difficulty . Sometimes subject instructed answer correctly ; time ask answer incorrectly . A strap place around subject 's chest two wire tap finger monitor heart rate , breathe rate sweat response scan . The scan take 2 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE The purpose study utilize functional MRI ( fMRI ) identify structural brain region activation pattern involve deception order determine whether illness deception differentiate involuntary conversion disorder . We intend compare brain activation functional movement disorder ( FMD ) patient healthy volunteer order determine whether various aspect disorder volitional control , suggest component illness deception , involuntary hypothesize conversion disorder . STUDY POPULATION We intend use 35 right-hand dominant adult healthy volunteer ( first five subject use develop method ) 30 functional movement disorder patient . DESIGN Using slow event-related design , scan subject use 3T fMRI scanner visually present survey-based stimulus require yes/no response use key press . Information use create stimuli pseudo-randomly derive one two database . The first database create information garner survey subject complete screen visit ( i.e . subject eye color height ) . The second database collection non-specific information ( i.e . current year , season , etc . ) intentionally apply subject . For question display , subject receive visual instruction respond either truthfully deceptively . Correct answer response evaluate base upon survey subject complete . In addition BOLD data collect , plan calculate reaction time acquire autonomic data order identify possible correlate brain response . OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure BOLD-fMRI data collect subject answer yes-no type question . Secondary outcome measure include reaction time autonomic data collect simultaneously fMRI data . Standard univariate general linear model analysis perform fMRI data well use multivariate method , include support vector machine learning . Subgroup analyse conduct characterize correlation reaction time , autonomic data , fMRI result well potential difference activation pattern subject-referenced question question unrelated subject .</detailed_description>
