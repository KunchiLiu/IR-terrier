	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetic Study Anthrax Immune Globulin Derived From Human Serum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The test product Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) , NP-015 . - The product supply sterile liquid suitable IV administration . - Product potency express unit anthrax toxin neutralization assay ( TNA ) per vial . - This study phase 1 , placebo control , dose-ranging study healthy volunteer . Subjects receive one three NP-015 dos ( 210 , 420 840 unit TNA ) equal volume saline placebo . - Enrolment sequential , start low NP-015 dose accrual next high dose patient low dose treat . - The first 3 Cohorts : The Subjects recruit cohort 24 , placebo control include dose group . In cohort , subject randomize receive either NP-015 ( N = 18/dosing group ) placebo ( N = 6/dosing group ) . For Cohort 4 : 20 Subjects recruit dosed high dose 2 additional product lot ( 10 subject per lot ) . Plasma sample draw 84 day . Plasma test anti-anthrax antibody protective antigen ( anti-PA ) ELISA toxin neutralization assay ( TNA ) . - Serological testing HIV , HBV HCV conduct screen determine eligibility . Nucleic acid amplification test ( NAT ) serological test HIV , HBV HCV conduct baseline ( day -1 ) final visit ( day 84 early withdrawal ) . NAT parvovirus B19 conduct baseline ( day -1 ) , day 14 , final visit ( day 84 early withdrawal ) . - Safety data collect throughout 84-day study . Screening ( within 28 day prior Baseline ) : - Informed consent - Review admission criterion - Medical history , general physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram concomitant medication record - Hematology , blood chemistry , urinalysis , viral serology ( anti-HIV-1/2 , Anti-HCV , HBsAg , anti-HBc ) - Serum pregnancy test female subject - Drug screen ( urine ) - Blood collection anti-PA antibody toxin neutralization assay ( TNA ) assessment Baseline ( Day -1 , within 24 hour prior Day 0 ) - Review admission criterion - Assessment brief physical exam , vital sign , weight , hematology , blood chemistry , urinalysis , concomitant medication - Assessment haptoglobin free hemoglobin level - Update medical history - NAT test HIV , HBV , HCV parvovirus B19 , serological test HIV , HBV HCV - Serum pregnancy test female subject - Alcohol ( urine ) drug screen ( urine ) - Blood collection baseline anti-PA antibody TNA assessment - Subjects require stay overnight follow baseline assessment NP-015 Administration ( day 0 ) - Following baseline assessment , NP-015 administer intravenously - Urinalysis perform end infusion period ( appearance color , specific gravity , protein , glucose , pH , occult blood , ketone , microscopic examination ) Assessments follow completion NP-015 administration ( 1 , 3 8 hr ; day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 42 , 56 84 early withdrawal ) - Following NP-015 administration , blood collect anti-PA antibody ELISA analysis TNA assessment respective time . - Assessment vital sign , adverse event concomitant medication . Additional Assessments : - Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 84 early withdrawal : Assessment hematology , blood chemistry urinalysis . - Day 1 : Assessment haptoglobin free hemoglobin level . - Day 14 : NAT parvovirus B19 . - Day 28 : serum pregnancy test female subject . - Final ( day 84 early withdrawal ) visit : general physical exam , serum pregnancy test female subject , viral marker test ( NAT HBV , HCV , HIV parvovirus B19 , serology HIV , HBV HCV ) perform . For Cohort 4 anti anthrax antibody test subject assess safety , day 28 .</detailed_description>
