	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find whether Placenta Growth Factor ( PlGF ) relate test predict development acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) period patient well admission hospital acute sickle event see measure predict development ACS . Understanding event precipitate ACS may lead preventative interventional therapy improve patient outcome quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research clinical study design test hypothesis PlGF level blood baseline patient SCD correlate leukotriene ( LT ) level reflective degree airway obstruction ; acute elevation PlGF level occur acute sickle event precede clinical radiological recognition ACS . This biological study fall criterion phase I-IV trial . Measurements do two stage . First , patient admit hospital acute sickle event daily evaluation first 4 day admission patient ACS event . Measurements inpatient spirometry ( primary site ) impulse oscillometry perform daily . Measurements 35 ACS event ACS develop 3rd/4th day admission collect . Measurements patient develop ACS compare develop ACS allow early prediction ACS . Finally , patient ACS admission acute sickling event evaluate 3-4 week order get baseline measurement . One hundred baseline measurement make . Twenty baseline patient also one two additional baseline evaluation subsequent clinic visit evaluate overall non-event baseline distribution intra-subject baseline variability . Patients measurement repeat admitted acute event great one year since last baseline measurement . These measurement use see prognostic information subsequent acute ACS event . Some patient may baseline data collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Patients must diagnosis SCD ( HbSS , HbSC HbS beta/thal ) hemoglobin electrophoresis gene mapping . Very patient HbSC HbS beta/thal would go onto develop ACS , serve important control . 2 . Patients must ≥5.5 year age ≤30 year age . 3 . Patients must able comply pulmonary function test . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients take antileukotriene medication montelukast ( Singulair® ) zileuton ( Zyflo® ) 30 day prior enrollment ineligible , although patient SCD asthma leukotriene inhibitor eligible . 2 . Patients know congenital heart disease congenital lung abnormality/disease affect pulmonary function test methacholine challenge test ineligible ( example include patient cyanotic heart disease , immotile cilium syndrome , cystic fibrosis , diaphragmatic hernia ) . 3 . Any patient neurologic abnormality , stroke , developmental delay , medical condition would preclude cooperation pulmonary function test compliance protocol procedure ineligible . 4 . Patients 30 year age ineligible . 5 . Patients pregnant nursing . 6 . Patients chronic transfusion ineligible . If patient come transfusion therapy , eligible 3 month follow last transfusion . Patients receive simple transfusion eligible , baseline measurement make 3 month follow simple transfusion .</criteria>
