	<detailed_description>Although 'colds ' seasonal influenza clinically different disease pandemic influenza , share common transmission pathway community level intervention need reduce seasonal flu , common viral upper respiratory infection pandemic influenza likely similar . Aims project compare impact two household level intervention ( alcohol base hand sanitizer without face mask ) six outcome : incidence strain virologically confirm influenza study households; rate symptoms; number secondary case households; antibiotic use practice symptom influenza viral upper respiratory infections; household member knowledge prevention treatment strategy pandemic influenza viral upper respiratory infections; rate influenza vaccination among household member . 450 household northern Manhattan ( primarily recently immigrate Hispanics ) randomize three group : control ( receive pamphlet influenza prevention ) , alcohol hand sanitizer , sanitizer plus face mask . Symptoms influenza monitor daily 15 month use ecological momentary assessment technology . Virologic culture obtain person flu symptom ( fever &gt; 100 degree F. , sore throat and/or cough ) . Antibiotic use practice , knowledge , vaccination rate assess survey use pilot , psychometrically sound instrument . For cluster randomization design randomize intervention household level , outcomes measure individual household level use generalize linear mixed model count response Poisson distribution appropriate multivariate technique control confound . Comparison ( ) : The purpose study try reduce transmission cold flu among household member one three intervention : comparison transmission group receive educational material group receive educational material instruct use alcohol hand sanitizers group receive educational material instruct use alcohol hand sanitizers well face mask somebody symptom flu</detailed_description>
