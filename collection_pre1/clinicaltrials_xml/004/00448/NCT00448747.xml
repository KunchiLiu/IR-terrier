	<brief_summary>The diagnosis GH deficiency ( GHD ) adult establish laboratory test patient appropriate clinical history hypothalamic pituitary disease . Two test consider gold standard test diagnosis GHD insulin tolerance test ( ITT ) GHRH combine arginine . However , test either bothersome ( give intravenously ) patient link side effect . Therefore , orally available compound like AEZS-130 ( formerly ARD-07 ) , demonstrate safe provide adequate sensitivity specificity could welcome alternative and/or complement current available test . The intent recruit 40 AGHD patient 40 normal control subject trial , original sponsor ( Ardana Biosciences Ltd. ) discontinue study financial reason complete . At time withdrawal GHRH market 2008 , 42 AGHD patient 10 normal control complete study 9 US site . This study reactivate complete remain 30 match control subject . Additionally upon agreement FDA SPA , 10 additional adult grow hormone deficient match control enrol trial total treat population approximatively 100 subject .</brief_summary>
