	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma gastric . Stage IV disease , amenable curative surgery , disease recurrence prior surgery . Disease status must measurable disease presence least one measurable lesion define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . In bidimensionally measurable lesion long diameter select measurement . Tumor lesion area prior radiation therapy may include clearly progress . If single lesion present patient prior therapy gastric adenocarcinoma , neoplastic nature lesion confirm cytology and/or histology . Ultrasound clinical examination allow assessment measurable disease . Elevation tumor marker , pleural pericardial effusion , ascites , bone lesion , cystic lesion , carcinomatous lymphangitis pulmonis/cutis define measurable . Performance Status 0 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Scale . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . No prior chemotherapy radiotherapy . Patient compliance geographic proximity allow adequate followup . Adequate organ function include follow : Bone marrow : absolute neutrophil count 1.5 x 10 ninth power/liter ( L ) , platelets 100 x 10 ninth power/L , hemoglobin &gt; =9 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) . Hepatic : bilirubin &lt; =1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase , aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase &lt; =3.0 x ULN . Renal : Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; =45 milliliter ( ml ) /minute . Men woman , age 18 70 year . For woman : Must surgically sterile , postmenopausal , compliant medically approve contraceptive regimen 3 month treatment period ; must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day study enrollment must breastfeed . For men : Must surgically sterile , compliant contraceptive regimen 3 month treatment period . Signed informed consent patient . Have receive treatment within last 30 day drug receive regulatory approval indication time study entry . Concurrent administration tumor therapy . Active infection . Serious concomitant disorder would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability complete study , discretion investigator . Pregnancy . Breastfeeding . History significant neurological mental disorder , include seizure dementia . Have prior malignancy gastric cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , unless prior malignancy diagnose definitively treat least 5 year previously subsequent evidence recurrence . Patients history low grade ( Gleason score less equal 6 ) localize prostate cancer eligible even diagnose less 5 year previously . Inability interrupt aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug 2 day , day , 2 day dose pemetrexed plus cisplatin . If patient take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) salicylate long halflife take 5 day , day , 2 day dose pemetrexed plus cisplatin . Clinically significant ascites pleural effusion apparent clinical examination control drainage procedure prior study enrollment . NOTE : Small effusion note computed tomography ( CT ) scan exclude patient study enrollment . Inability unwillingness take folic acid , vitamin B12 supplementation , dexamethasone . Known suspected brain metastasis . Patients clinical sign symptoms suspicious brain metastasis must pretreatment CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . A patient document brain metastasis , time consideration study entry past , exclude enter study .</criteria>
