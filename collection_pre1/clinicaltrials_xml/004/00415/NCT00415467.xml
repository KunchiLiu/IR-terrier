	<detailed_description>Your doctor find brain tumor need surgically remove . Your doctor explain risk benefit surgery . After brain tumor surgically remove , tumor may leave . A treatment send additional radiation right place around tumor locate , may help kill tumor cell leave surgery . This treatment call brachytherapy . Your doctor explain risk benefit brachytherapy . Researchers study would like evaluate radiation delivery system , GliaSite RTS , provide brachytherapy target specific site brain , see effect surround area tumor locate . The GliaSite RTS balloon attach end tube access port . The balloon put space left behind tumor take . The end tube access port outside skull , underneath skin , top head . The balloon fill radiation therapy solution provide radiation therapy remain tumor cell next space tumor remove . Before already schedule surgery , series test perform find qualify participation study . You complete medical history temperature , blood pressure , pulse measure . A standard neurological exam perform , mental status , vision , sensory function , speech , motor skill , function evaluate . Women able child must negative urine blood pregnancy test . A MRI/CT scan take head . As part MRI/CT , get injection contrast solution vein . The MRI/CT image show brain swell bleeding . It also show edge tumor area use confirm receive radiation therapy GliaSite RTS . If qualify study , small balloon ( GliaSite ) place space tumor remove surgery . The balloon fill x-ray dye normal saline ( sterile water salt ) make sure balloon properly fill space tumor remove . Your surgeon stitch head close . It possible surgeon may decide place GliaSite device space tumor . If surgeon chooses place GliaSite device , offer alternative treatment , recover surgery . The balloon fill x-ray dye solution place surgical cavity keep fill replaced radioactive solution . You MRI/CT head . Following MRI/CT exam , get injection contrast solution vein . You second MRI/CT exam head , show contrast solution . The MRI/CT image show brain swell bleeding . It also show edge tumor area balloon locate . These image use confirm receive radiation therapy GliaSite RTS device . You may also x-ray film brain confirm balloon placement . You may able leave hospital surgery . You may readmitted hospital radiation therapy one two week surgery . Twenty-four hour start radiation therapy , begin take medication continue take 24 hour radiation therapy finish . This medication , iodine-potassium iodide solution , keep thyroid gland gather much radiation event balloon leak . Before radiation therapy begin , x-ray film brain may take show location balloon verify balloon still properly place . Once placement balloon confirm , x-ray dye saline remove catheter . The balloon fill radiation therapy solution normal saline . You may able go home material put balloon . If do , special instruction give must follow send home . You must return hospital appropriate time removal radioactive material . Otherwise , hospital entire time get radiation therapy . When radiation therapy complete 3 7 day , radiation therapy solution remove balloon . The GliaSite device rinse normal saline . This rinsing help lessen radioactivity remain device . After completion brachytherapy , balloon completely empty GliaSite device surgically remove . When doctor feel ready , discharged hospital . Following completion brachytherapy , may receive form radiation therapy prescribe physician . This usually do outpatient . You ask follow doctor certain time point receive brachytherapy treatment . The time point 1 month 3 month brachytherapy every 3 month ( example , 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 month ) . During follow visit , ask complete mini-mental status examination refer MMSE . You ask complete quality life questionnaire . Your physician may take MRI CT image brain he/she think necessary.If undergone second operation brain cancer , ask surgery . You ask steroid medication take dose change since last visit . Your doctor also ask cancer medication treatment receive since last visit.You doctor may discuss serious event happen since last visit . This investigational study . The device FDA approve . About 300 patient take part multicenter study . Up 20 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must histologically prove malignant brain tumor 2 . Patient must candidate surgical resection tumor mass . 3 . Patient must pregnant breastfeeding . All patient potential pregnancy counsel request follow acceptable birth control method avoid conception . 4 . Patient must sign informed consent form 1 . Serious concurrent infection medical illness could jeopardize ability patient receive GliaSite catheter reasonable safety .</criteria>
