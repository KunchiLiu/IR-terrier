	<brief_summary>This 12-month randomized control trial , sponsor NIH/NCI , aim reduce BMI obese adolescent ( age 11 -13 ) intervene physical activity nutrition behavior within primary care setting . PACE-PC theory-based step care program enables pediatricians primary care provider intervene obese adolescent improve anthropometric , metabolic , physiological , behavioral , quality life outcomes one-year period . The program integrate clinician counseling , health educator counseling , phone mail contact . It support tailor need obese adolescent family member promote improved diet physical activity behavior , weight loss , ultimately weight loss maintenance . Participants randomly assign Enhanced Usual Care PACE-PC step care condition . The Enhanced Standard Care condition include initial visit counsel physician , 3 visit health educator , material improve weight relate behavior . The PACE-PC Stepped Care condition include 3 step ( last 4 month ) , first step intensive : Step 1 include : physician visit , monthly health educator visit , biweekly phone counseling , weekly dissemination nutrition physical activity information Step 2 include : health educator visit every month , biweekly phone counseling , weekly dissemination nutrition physical activity information Step 3 include : monthly phone counsel weekly dissemination nutrition physical activity information Participants randomize PACE-PC condition enrol Step 1 ( intensive ) first 4 month . Depending upon response end Step 1 , next 4 month adolescent triaged Step 2 ( less intensive ) repeat Step 1 . At 8 month , base upon treatment response , triage occur either Step 3 ( least intensive ) repetition previous step .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PACE-PC : Primary Care Management Adolescent Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity adolescence become increasingly prevalent . Thirty year ago prevalence obesity among adolescent age 12-19 year approximately 6 % . Between 1980 1994 , number child adolescent meet criterion overweight/obese , define body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 95 % child age gender , increase 100 % United States ( Ogden , Flegal , Carroll et al. , 2002 ) . The increased prevalence childhood obesity universal age , gender , ethnicity classification . As year 2002 , 16 % adolescent obese United States ( Ogden et al. , 2002 ) problem even important select region country . For example , California Center Public Health Advocacy , ( 2002 ) , report percentage 5th , 7th , 9th grader ( age 10 15 year ) body mass index ( BMI ) great 95th percentile range 17.3 % - 36 % depend upon school attend . Overall childhood obesity increasingly recognize one nation 's important health issue ( IOM , 2004 ) . Obesity affect part body include brain , lung , heart , liver , pancreas , intestine , kidney , skeleton . Consequently , child meet criterion obesity risk serious health problem . A low quality life also show among child overweight ( Schwimmer et al. , 2003 ) . Adolescent obesity also significant predictor adult obesity ( Clark &amp; Lauer , 1993 ; Mossberg , 1989 ) . Approximately 1/3 overweight adult overweight 20 year age . An even large percentage morbidly obese adult become obese child ( Rimm &amp; Rimm , 1976 ) . Overweight adolescent pediatric group carry high risk childhood obesity persistence adulthood ( Whitaker et al. , 1997 ) . There strong evidence health benefit physical activity ( USDHHS , 1996 ; Biddle et al. , 2004 ) include improvement risk cancer , longevity , cardiovascular disease , ( CVD ) , CVD risk factor , diabetes , obesity , osteoporosis , immune functioning , mental health . More recent guideline Dietary Guidelines Americans ( USDHHS , 2005 ) United Kingdom Health Education Authority recommend 60 minute daily PA youth ( Biddle et al. , 1998 ; Cavill et al. , 2001 ) . Although national survey data U.S. indicate two-thirds adolescent boy one-half adolescent girl meet adult-oriented recommendation vigorous activity ( Pate et al. , 1994 ) , objective measure suggest less 40 % teen meet 60 minute guideline ( Pate et al. , 2002 ) . Females , old adolescent , minority disadvantage youth even less likely meeting recommendation ( USDHHS , 1998 ) . Poor dietary behavior know risk factor development obesity , well nation 's three leading cause death : CHD , cancer stroke . Research support diet rich fruit vegetable low fat important preventing chronic disease , recommend USDA , USDHHS , Surgeon General , NRC , NHLBI , NCI , ACS , AHA ( USDA , 1991 ; USDA , 1992 ; National Research Council , 1989 ; NHLBI , 1990 ; NHLBI , 1991 ; NCI , 1991 ; Weinhouse et al. , 1991 ; AHA , 1988 ) . Although national survey indicate decline average proportion calorie total saturate fat past several decade , CDC estimate 2000 38 % individual 2 year old meet recommendation total fat intake 41 % individual meet recommendation saturate fat intake . Simple dietary restriction associate successful weight control ( NAS , 1991 ) may even result nutritionally inadequate diet . Thus , rather focus limit total energy intake , important promote diet nutrient dense : high vegetable , fruit , grain , fiber-rich plant food , yet low fat , give level energy intake . Obesity chronic health condition ( WHO , 1998 ) . As , long-term medical management appropriate , particular attention comorbidity development identification . According Institute Medicine ( IOM ) , primary care `` provision integrated , accessible healthcare service clinicians accountable address large majority personal healthcare need , develop sustain partnership patient practice within context family community '' ( IOM , 1996 ) . '' Various study evaluate primary healthcare find primary care provide accessible , comprehensive , coordinate , adequately communicate , longitudinal healthcare ( Flocke , 1997 ; Safran et al. , 1998 ; Starfield , 1998 ) . Primary healthcare call `` medical home ; '' American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) ( 1992 , p. 251 ) describe `` medical home '' ( respect care infant , child , adolescent ) : `` accessible , continuous , comprehensive , family center , coordinate , compassionate '' ; `` deliver directed physician able manage facilitate essentially aspects pediatric care '' ; involve physician `` know child family able develop relationship mutual responsibility trust . '' Thus , pediatrician , family physician others primary care many opportunity assist obesity treatment child . Although child adolescent visit physician less often age group , amount contact extensive . Overweight youth may even likely visit primary care physician compare non-overweight child ( Gauthier et al. , 2000 ) . In addition , adolescent indicate willingness desire discus weight issue healthcare provider ( Hodgson et al. , 1986 ; Marks et al. , 1983 ) . The American Heart Association American Diabetes Association advocate primary care counsel modifiable coronary artery disease risk factor , include obesity , preventive health examination ( ADA , 2001 ; Grundy et al. , 1997 ) . In recent study conduct two primary care practice Louisiana ( Huang et al. , 2004 ) , primary care practitioner counsel weight loss well-received patient effective increase patient ' understand negative health impact obesity . However , also identify study lack sufficient guidance weight management strategy primary care practitioner . Potential reason deficiency include : insufficient physician confidence , knowledge counseling skill , well lack time , resource use dietitian contribute inadequate counseling diet , physical activity , weight loss ( Yeager et al. , 1996 ) The extent content physician counsel diet , exercise , weight loss inadequate ( Galuska et al. , 1999 ; Nawaz et al. , 2000 ) . This discourage give fact physician-patient interaction regard healthy diet habit show effect change result improved eating habit ( USPSTF , 2002 ) weight loss ( Nawaz , 2000 ) . Given potential , surprising little research conduct primary care intervention obesity childhood . To knowledge , study Saelens et al. , 200 study date evaluate primary care-based behavioral therapy program weight control management adolescent . One pilot study evaluate feasibility introduce low glycemic index diet primary care set primary-care-based therapy ( Young et al. , 2004 ) . While preliminary data promising , treatment address nutritional issue associate obesity . The stepped care treatment scheme chronic disease advocate time ( Black et al. , 1984 ; Brownell , 1992 ) . Usually strategy step-up one least intensive , least expensive , least dangerous approach use first individual . Only non-responders progress next intensive step , follow additional increase intervention intensity subject fail respond . While step care approach model above-described step-up method , current model advocate United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) NHLBI adhere step-down approach patient begin intensive step follow less intensive interaction patient gain self-efficacy self-management skill . In USPSTF review 17 randomize control trial high-intensity ( monthly face-to-face contact ) , medium-intensity ( monthly face-to-face contact ) , low-intensity ( less monthly interpersonal contact ) intervention obesity ( McTigue et al. , 2003 ) , effective treatment method high intensity combine two three component ( nutrition education , diet exercise counseling , behavioral strategy ) within first 3 month therapy . These method able achieve weight loss range 3 5 kilogram one year follow-up visit . In addition , NHLBI obesity management recommendation ( NHLBI , 2000 ) encourage regular frequent medical follow-up first 6 month therapy follow tapered visit frequency schedule . Weight management important principle emphasize NHLBI , encourage continue therapeutic modality `` maintenance period '' ( may continue indefinitely ) prevent regain weight lose . Structured treatment program regular follow-up improve long-term weight loss maintenance ( Perri et al. , 1993 ; Lantz et al. , 2003 ) . Research date suggest primary care-based `` stepped-down '' care model palatable may efficacious promote weight loss population scale . In sum , propose study help fill several gap literature : There little known : - How enable primary care pediatrician , family physicians others `` front line '' clinical setting successfully intervene obese adolescent patient . In many geographical area alternative intervention adolescent obesity ( e.g. , specialist care community-based program ) might either non-existent difficult access . Thus role primary care clinician may even important . - Obesity intervention type individual age 18 year . The increase prevalence health problem far outstrip medical knowledge regard treatment population . - The impact intervention like PACE-PC anthropometric , metabolic , physiological behavioral measure outcomes obese adolescent . Understanding intervention do—and not—alter key health relate factor associate obesity critical overall field pediatric obesity . - Whether adherence , outcomes associate , obesity treatment improve multi-channel , step care program like PACE-PC . There report literature step care approach pediatric obesity , especially incorporate element chronic care model . - Whether weight change bring one year multimodal intervention sustain additional year less intensive maintenance intervention . Maintenance weight status follow weight loss difficult . Exploring method accomplish important . - The cost-effectiveness intervention PACE-PC obese adolescent . If intervention become generalize , someone must willing pay , either employer entity risk healthcare expense , consumer . Increased knowledge cost effectiveness PACE-PC inform decision make party .</detailed_description>
