	<criteria>Patients noninfectious scleritis idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease require chronic immunosuppressive treatment disease control . Intolerance , failure respond , inability taper prednisone &gt; 10mg/day addition one systemic immunosuppressive ( methotrexate , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclosporine , cyclophosphamide , chlorambucil ) . Patients must stable dosage prednisone least one steroidsparing agent 30 day prior screening/enrollment . Active disease define use physician judgment support patient physician global ocular disease assessment &gt; 5 cm 10cm visual analog scale anchor word `` Inactive Eye Disease '' 0 cm point `` Extremely Active Eye Disease '' 10cm point . Investigator discretion may apply case . Selected patient biological agent TNF blocker etanercept , infliximab adalimumab ongoing ocular disease acceptable . There 8 week washout period etanercept 12 week washout period infliximab adalimumab patient dose rituximab . In patient concomitant systemic autoimmune disease include RA , SLE , Sjogrens , Wegener 's granulomatosis systemic disease must sufficiently stable life threaten allow taper steroid and/or immunosuppressive agent thus allow assessment ocular effect rituximab . Adults gender &gt; 18 year old . There upper age limit long disqualify health condition . Have recent ( &lt; 3 month old ) PPD skin test consider eligible accord tuberculosis ( TB ) screening , eligibility assessment , prevention rule define Appendix C. Screening laboratory test result acceptable Investigator prior place patient study drug . Must chest radiograph within 3 month prior first infusion evidence malignancy , infection fibrosis . Adequate renal function indicate normal BUN creatinine level . Untreated thyroid disease Organ threaten systemic disease evidence rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis , pulmonary hemorrhage respiratory failure , seizures psychosis , progressive neuropathy myopathy General Safety &amp; Laboratory Exclusion Criteria Patients exclude study base follow criterion : Hemoglobin : &lt; 8.5 gm/dL Platelets : &lt; 100,000/mm AST ALT &gt; 2.5 x Upper Limit Normal unless related primary disease .
