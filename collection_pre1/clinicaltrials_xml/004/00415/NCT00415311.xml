	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , randomize , Phase 1B study evaluate liver transplant recipient receive rhMBL ( 2 cohort ) without rhMBL ( 1 cohort ) . Patients receive orthotopic liver transplant ( OLT ) living relate donor ( LRD ) liver transplant . Patients cohort receive immunosuppressant therapy anti-infectious prophylactic supportive therapy accord institutional standard . The donor 's mannose-binding lectin ( MBL ) genotype evaluate determine liver transplant recipient 's study eligibility . For recipient receive OLT , sample liver tissue lymph node collect donor liver time organ harvest MBL genotyping . For recipient receive LRD transplant , MBL genotype LRD determine companion protocol , `` Screening Protocol Evaluate Mannose-Binding Lectin ( MBL ) Genotype Living Related Donors Liver Transplant Recipients . '' A recipient whose donor A/O O/O MBL genotype eligible participate study . Patients randomize 2:2:1 ratio receive 8 intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion rhMBL dose 0.5 1.0 mg/kg , receive rhMBL , respectively . Approximately 20 patient treat 2 rhMBL arm , approximately 10 patient treated standard immunosuppressive agent anti-infectious prophylaxis rhMBL . Cohort 1 - Number Patients 20 - rhMBL ( mg/kg ) 0.5 Cohort 2 - Number Patients 20 - rhMBL ( mg/kg ) 1.0 Cohort 3 - Number Patients 10 - rhMBL ( mg/kg ) None</detailed_description>
