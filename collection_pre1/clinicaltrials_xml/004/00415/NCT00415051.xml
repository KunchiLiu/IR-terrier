	<brief_summary>This study determine vaccine Rift Valley Fever ( RVF ) safe give human . The study examine well vaccine ( RVF MP-12 ) stimulate body 's immune response ( fights infection ) vaccine stable virus use make vaccine change different form inject body . Twenty healthy volunteer ( 18-50 year old ) vaccinate single dose undiluted RVF MP-12 , injected muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rift Valley Fever ( RVF ) mosquito-borne disease Africa affect human animal . The disease pose significant endemic disease threat , etiologic agent ( RVF virus ) possess physical biochemical characteristic result classification Category A Agent . Historically , disease confine Africa . In September 2000 , however , RVF appear western part Kingdom Saudi Arabia ( 843 case 114 death ) Yemen ( 1,087 suspect case 121 death ) . It think Rift Valley fever introduce new geographic area importation infect livestock Djibouti . Mosquito transmission subsequently demonstrate area , suggest disease may become permanently establish . A safe effective RVF vaccine capable induce protective immunity single injection urgently need . Currently , drug available alter course disease human animal , license vaccine RVF approve human use . This protocol open-label , Phase II study ass safety , immunogenicity genetic stability RVF MP-12 vaccine human . The objective study collect safety immunogenicity data intramuscular ( IM ) injection live , attenuated , mutagenized RVF 12th mutagenesis passage ( MP-12 ) vaccine characterize isolates Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) MP-12 vaccine recover blood vaccinated volunteer use vitro system evaluate genetic stability . A total 20 volunteer recruit among military civilian person around USAMRIID general population around Frederick , Maryland , expect remain area duration study . Volunteers vaccinate undiluted RVF MP-12 vaccine . Safety evaluate record frequency severity clinical reaction vaccine , well measure complete blood count select serum biochemistry ( enzyme ) value . Immunogenicity evaluate measure 80 % plaque reduction neutralization ( PRNT80 ) antibodies RVF virus period 1 year follow vaccination . Genetic stability vaccine evaluate examine isolates recover blood vaccinated volunteer molecular sequence technique , compare finding vaccine virus inoculum . Subjects participate study 1 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Between 18 50 year old Free chronic medical condition require ongoing therapy general good health determine physician investigator Have current ( within 30 day schedule blood donation study ) complete blood ( cell ) count ( CBC ) include Hct Hgb show evidence anemia , total white blood cell differential platelet count within normal range , well hepatic enzyme ( AST , ALT , LDH ) value within normal laboratory range Negative human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody test within 3 month precede vaccination No evidence preexist liver disease current infection Hepatitis A , B , C virus determine serology No evidence preexist eye disease , determine fundoscopic/slit lamp examination study ophthalmologist refractory change No evidence history serologic test previous infection RVF virus RVF vaccine Subjects must agree refrain intimate contact ( sexual activity ) , use barrier contraception ( e.g. , condom ) , 2week period follow vaccination Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen morning vaccination prior receipt vaccine must agree use highly effective method birth control first 3 month follow receipt MP12 vaccine . A highly effective method birth control define one failure rate le 1 % per year . Acceptable birth control method meet criterion include hormonal implant injectables ( Norplant , DepProvera , Lunelle , Etonogestrel ) ; combine oral contraceptive ; intrauterine device ( IUDs ) Copper T ( 380A ) Mirena ( Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System ) ; female sterilization ( tubal ligation ) ; sexual abstinence ; vasectomized partner . Subjects must medically clear participation investigator Subjects must expect remain area duration study Volunteer must sign approve informed consent Volunteer must willing return followup visit include postvaccination ophthalmologic visit Volunteer must willing refrain excessive ( individual 's normal routine ) exercise period least 2 week prior follow vaccination Volunteer must willing abstain drink alcoholic beverage period least 2 week prior follow vaccination . Volunteer must `` weekend '' drinker normally drink 2 drink day male 1 drink day female . Volunteer must agree report adverse event ( AE ) may may associate administration test article participation study . History evidence liver disease/abnormality History preexist thymic disease thymic dysfunction ( cellular immune antibody disorder ) Be take medication , prescription nonprescription ( exclude dietary supplement ) , regular basis exception contraceptive pill . This include regular use statin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , immunosuppressive agent , antiviral , topical steroidal cream , nasal spray . Conditions require intermittent medication decision regard eligibility due medication use deferred physician investigator . Elevation upper limit laboratory normal value liver enzyme , history unexplained elevation liver enzymes History evidence eye disease ( exclude change refraction strabismus ) Abnormal clinical lab result indicate evidence anemia , immunosuppression , immune deficiency disease Have donate 1 unit ( 500 cc ) blood reason 2 month ( 56 day ) precede administration vaccine ( assessed query ) Plan donate blood within 1 year follow receipt vaccine History evidence previous infection RVF vaccination RVF Any known allergy component vaccine : Human serum albumin ( stabilizer ) , SolUPro , Neomycin ( antibiotic ) , sorbitol , Lproline , Larginine , monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) , Urea Administration another vaccine within 4 week RVF MP12 vaccination `` Weekend '' drinker , male drink 2 drink day females drink 1 drink day , exclude Individuals plan start new exercise program within two week vaccination ( either two week prior two week follow vaccination ) exclude . Individuals already regular exercise program normal transaminase level exclude advised increase level activity period one month ( two week prior two week vaccination ) . Individuals exercise regularly participate study advise embark exercise program time period . Volunteers caution salivary contact contact infant , child age 8 year , adult age 64 year , anyone immunocompromised poor health . Volunteers feel unable comply restriction exclude study .</criteria>
