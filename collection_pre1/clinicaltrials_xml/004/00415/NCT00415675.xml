	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To collect accurate reliable respiration-induced anatomic structure motion data use four-dimensional ( 4-D ) image technology . - To analyze data study respiration-induced variation pattern variation position , shape volume tumor normal anatomic structure thorax abdomen breathe cycle , one breathing cycle next , day-to-day course radiotherapy . - To assess dosimetric potential clinical consequence respiratory motion current practice radiotherapy preclinical treatment simulation ( treatment planning ) study . - To quantify potential consequence explicitly account respiration-induced motion dose distribution outcome ( tumor control probabilities normal tissue complication probability ) preclinical treatment simulation study . Secondary Objectives : - To investigate feasibility use patient training regulate patient breathe improve quality image stratify patient eligibility respiratory-correlated imaging radiotherapy implementation various strategy mitigation respiratory-induced motion . - To assess degree correlation marker ( internal anatomic structure diaphragm ) track surrogate breathing motion structure intra-fraction inter-fraction reproducibility correlation . - To quantify effect radiation therapy pattern respiratory-induced motion structure preclinical treatment simulation study . - To compare various strategy either account mitigate respiration-induced motion planning delivery radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>You take part study receive radiotherapy treatment tumor . You train breathe certain way help study staff perform motion CT scan . You may ask breathe normally , hold breath , breathe follow TV monitor . On monitor , view breathe trace use trace regulate breathing instruct health professional . While right position scan , study staff perform motion CT scan . A total 12 scan session hold entire course radiotherapy . The first scanning session may last 45 90 minute , late session may shorter . These CT scan separate routine CT scan may receive part regular radiation treatment planning . Scans may take various period time . The scan take one right another , short separation . One scan take first day , next scan next day , week later . By look scan , researcher well understand tumor organ move breath breath , day day , week week . This investigational study . About 210 patient tumor location take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients pathological diagnosis cancer thorax abdomen . 2 . Patients must plan radiation therapy deliver least 4 week ( minimum standard duration curative radiotherapy ) . 3 . Patients must able lie flat duration CT image acquisition session . 1 . Patients neither able breathe hold breath regular reproducible manner remove study ineligible . Breathing breathholding regularity determination base respiration trace acquire RPM system .</criteria>
