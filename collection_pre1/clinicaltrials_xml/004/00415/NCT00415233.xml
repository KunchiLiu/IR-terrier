	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radioactive iodine use radiation kill tumor cell . Giving iodine I 131 without thyroid-stimulating hormone surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know dose iodine I 131 effective give without thyroid-stimulating hormone treat thyroid cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different dos iodine I 131 compare well work give without thyroid-stimulating hormone treat patient undergone surgery thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iodine I 131 With Without Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare percentage successful remnant ablation 6-8 month administration high- vs low-dose iodine I 131 v without recombinant thyroid-stimulating hormone patient undergone total thyroidectomy differentiate thyroid cancer . Secondary - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare locoregional recurrence patient treat regimen . - Compare distant metastasis , survival , incidence second primary malignancy patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , factorial , randomize study . Patients stratify accord treatment center disease stage ( I vs II v III v IVA ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . Patients receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy ( THRT ) * thyroxine ( T4 ) ** liothyronine sodium ( T3 ) . Patients randomized arm III IV discontinue THRT 4 week ( patient receive T4 ) 2 week ( patient receive T3 ) prior remnant ablation . NOTE : *Some treatment center may choose avoid start THRT patient randomize arm III IV . NOTE : **Patients receive T4 may switch T3 2 week discontinue THRT . - Arm I : Patients receive recombinant thyroid-stimulating hormone ( rTSH ) intramuscularly day 1 2 undergo remnant ablation low-dose iodine I 131 day 3 . - Arm II : Patients receive rTSH arm I undergo remnant ablation high-dose iodine I 131 day 3 . - Arm III : Patients undergo remnant ablation low-dose iodine I 131 arm I . - Arm IV : Patients undergo remnant ablation high-dose iodine I 131 arm II . Quality life assess baseline , day 3 remnant ablation , 3 month . After completion study therapy , patient follow 3 month , 6-8 month , annually thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 468 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
