	<detailed_description>Rapid diagnosis treatment acute ischemic stroke critical reduce disability death cause stroke . While recombinant tissue plasminogen activator , rt-PA , approve treatment acute ischemic stroke , less 2-3 percent individual stroke actually receive treatment . The inability capture acute ischemic stroke case within 3 hour symptom onset one critical factor .

Participants randomize receive usual medical care——which include standard educational information stroke , stroke warn sign risk factors——or usual medical care plus 2-session interactive stroke educational program . All participant administer pre post ( 30 day 1 year ) intervention stroke knowledge/behavior survey . In additional , participant contact every 12 month check health status document new stroke event associated emergency room arrival time . The SWIFT study part Specialized Program Translational Research Acute Stroke ( SPOTRIAS ) , seek understand certain people may increase risk stroke . The goal study increase stroke knowledge , change behavior , improve emergency room arrival time upon onset stroke symptom .</detailed_description>
