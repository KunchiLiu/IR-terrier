	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find use PR1 peptide vaccine ( PR1 ) without PEG-IntronÂ® ( interferon ) combination interferon reduce eliminate disease patient CML cytogenetic remission treatment imatinib mesylate , still small amount disease able notice ( detect ) . Researchers want see give low dos interferon together PR1 may make vaccine effective . The safety treatment study also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteinase 3 PR1 Peptide Mixed With Montanide ISA-51 VG Adjuvant Administered With GM-CSF PEG-INTRON ( R )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Your disease respond well treatment imatinib mesylate . It complete cytogenetic remission . This mean Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) , change genetic material believe lead leukemia , longer detectable ( standard chromosome analysis ) bone marrow blood cell . A molecular remission , researcher want achieve , mean great reduction complete elimination Ph . The small amount disease detect use technique call polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . This powerful test detect small amount disease still present bone marrow and/or blood cell . PR1 experimental vaccine make protein find large amount leukemia cell CML . Imatinib mesylate ( already receive standard therapy ) design bind certain protein tumor cell , may prevent cell grow . Interferon drug use standard therapy patient CML imatinib mesylate available . It help immune system function effectively ( cause leukemia cell show PR1 ) , may make leukemia cell well target kill . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . You complete medical history record . You blood draw ( 2 tablespoon ) routine test . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . You also blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) see necessary protein ( call HLA-A2 ) need vaccine recognize cell . You also additional blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) test ( use PCR test ) level leukemia blood . You bone marrow aspiration . To collect bone marrow aspiration , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . You chromosome test do number chromosome bone marrow ( collect bone marrow aspiration ) . You additional procedure perform test . For test , chromosomes 20 cell bone marrow count see may unhealthy change ( Ph ) present well many may present . If find eligible take part study , receive PR1 small needle skin ( subcutaneous injection ) . Imatinib mesylate continue give mouth dose take part standard therapy . PR1 mixed substance call Montanide ISA 51 VG , regular procedure help immune system respond PR1 . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group . Participants one group receive subcutaneous injection interferon PR1 vaccination . Participants group receive PR1 vaccination without interferon . Regardless group assign , also receive , PR1 vaccination , growth hormone call GM-CSF . The purpose GM-CSF boost immune system ( response PR1 vaccine ) help kill leukemia . It give subcutaneous injection arm thigh . All participant receive total 4 dos PR1 vaccine . The first 3 vaccination give every 3 week , last vaccination give 18 week start therapy study . You receive vaccination M. D. Anderson . Every time come injection PR1 , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You blood draw ( 2 tablespoon ) routine test , blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) PCR test . After receive last vaccination , continue PCR test every 3 month test level leukemia blood see disease respond vaccine . You bone marrow aspiration 1 month 6 month last vaccination . To measure response immune system PR1 , blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) first vaccination , Weeks 6 , 18 , 22 6 month treatment . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease progress ( come remission ) . This investigational study . PR1 mixed Montanide ISA-51 VG authorize FDA use research . Interferon GM-CSF FDA-approved commercially available . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
