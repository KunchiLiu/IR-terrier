	<brief_title>Use INAMED LAPBAND System Reduce BMI 's Obese Renal Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concern transplant surgeon obese patient high BMI 's likely experience post-transplantation complication age-matched recipient [ 1 ] . Nevertheless , Summa transplant list contains numerous patient renal failure BMI 's 35 . These patient consider `` active '' transplant candidate obesity eligible receive kidney transplant . Dr. Lal counsel patient must lose weight order consider active candidate transplantation . Weight loss obese patient renal failure difficult . These patient must undergo hemodialysis three time weekly . Most patient , physically , engage exercise activity . Many patient burden psychologically , behavioral responsibility relate weight loss may overstress . Repetitive diet behavioral therapy morbidly obese patient prior transplantation disappointing result [ 2 ] . Likewise , pharmacological management obesity patient largely unsuccessful . Noradrenergic appetite suppressant must restrict stimulatory side-effects . Serotonergic agent cardiovascular pulmonary complication . Thermogenic agent minimally effective [ 2 ] . The INAMED LAPBAND SYSTEM FDA-approved , surgically-placed device market facilitate weight reduction obese individual . The LAPBAND position laparoscopically around stomach require overnight hospitalization upper GI swallow next morning . The device gradually adjusted increase stomach constriction physician office set patient loses approximately 1-2 pound per week two year . These adjustment perform average 4-5 time first year twice second year . The purpose pilot study assess utility LAPBAND facilitate weight loss obese renal failure patient await transplantation document issue relate use patient . The hope LAPBAND facilitate enough weight loss reduce patient 's BMI 35 placement LAPBAND . If patient reach intend goal BMI 35 , place active renal transplant list eligible transplantation . A secondary goal research follow patient successfully reach BMI 's 35 less subsequently transplant determine untoward effect LAPBAND upon transplantation success</detailed_description>
