	<brief_summary>This medical research study . The study investigator develop method gradually repair pectus excavatum ( sunken chest ) deformity place magnet sternum ( breastbone ) apply external magnetic force pull sternum outward gradually . Potential candidate study child adolescent previously diagnose congenital pectus excavatum ( sunken chest ) deformity otherwise healthy seek corrective surgery condition . They resident U.S. age 8 14 year age . Potential candidate family already counsel condition standard way repair deformity . The purpose study test effect , good and/or bad , place external/internal magnetic device correct pectus excavatum deformity child , safety use device treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pectus excavatum common congenital chest wall abnormality child . Surgical correction require big operation general anesthesia force sternum forward hold place use metal chest wall strut . Deformation chest wall great pressure may result complication potential relapse well postoperative pain require hospitalization regional narcotic anesthesia week . An alternative principle correction chest wall deformity gradual ( bit-by-bit ) correction use minimal force apply many month ( like move teeth orthodontic brace ) . The hypothesis study constant outward force deform cartilage pectus excavatum produce biologic reformation cartilage correction chest wall deformity . The study investigator develop novel method achieve gradual deformation/reformation chest wall cartilage without need transdermal orthopedic device repeat surgery . A magnetic force field use apply control , sustain force promote biologic reformation structural cartilage ( principle distraction osteogenesis ) . A magnet implant sternum secure use novel fixation strategy accomplish 3-cm subxyphoid incision brief outpatient procedure . The magnet ( sternum ) pull outward another magnet suspend novel , low-profile , lightweight device previously mold patient 's anterior chest wall . The external magnet allow individual adjustment small increment distance ( , thus , force ) orientation force apply sternum . The low-profile , non-obtrusive anterior chest wall prosthesis hold place force field two magnet . The study objectives test safety probable benefit procedure 10 otherwise healthy , young patient , 8 year 14 year age , choose deformity correct use novel technique rather standard Ravitch Nuss technique . We document rate correction chest image measurement Pectus Severity Index . The study investigator document safety efficacy EKG prior implantation , one month post-implantation , finally magnet remove , well patient family satisfaction post-procedure Quality Life-type survey .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Residents United States previously diagnose pectus excavatum refer UCSF Pediatric Surgery Service evaluation treatment consider participation study . Only patient moderate severe pectus excavatum meet inclusion criterion participate . The patient family fully counsel consent risk benefit participation study , ask sign inform consent review approve UCSF Committee Human Research . 1 . Resident U.S. ; 2 . Otherwise healthy male female pectus excavatum deformity ; 3 . Between 8 14 year age ; 4 . Pectus Severity Index &gt; 3.5 ( normal 2.56 ) ; 5 . Ability read speak English . 1 . Other congenital anomaly ( include significant skeletal anomaly scoliosis , bony fusion involve cervical vertebra ) directly relate pectus excavatum ; 2 . Bleeding disorder ; 3 . Heart disease ( include arrhythmia ) ; 4 . Persons active implantable medical device ( AIMD ) pacemaker ; 5 . Persons relative ( ) close family friend ( ) living within household pacemaker ; 6 . Persons arteriovenous malformation ; 7 . Chest deformity complicate pectus excavatum ( e.g.. Poland syndrome ) ; 8 . Persons foreign body implant would pose risk ( e.g. , immunodeficiency ) ; 9 . Persons increase risk general anesthesia ( e.g. , history malignant hyperthermia ) ; 10 . Respiratory condition require steroid treatment ( e.g. , prednisone ) last 3 year ; 11 . Pregnancy ; 12 . Inability understand follow instruction ; 13 . Refusal wear external brace ; 14 . Inability obtain preapproval ( authorization ) patient 's insurance carrier ; 15 . Inability refusal return UCSF weekly followup visit first month surgery .</criteria>
