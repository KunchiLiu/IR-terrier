	<detailed_description>150 child age 6-12 year reside Baltimore smoker household enrol study . All child randomize three group : HEPA air cleaner plus ETS/Indoor particulate behavior management , HEPA air cleaner standard asthma education standard asthma education group delay HEPA filter use . The HEPA air clean plus ETS/Indoor particulate behavior management intervention group receive four home visit health coach ass motivation parental behavior change assist parent reduce/eliminate child 's exposure ETS home . The intervention base social cognitive theory utilizes behavior modification technique ( e.g. , modeling , reinforcement , self-monitoring , feedback rehearsal ) change health behavior . Families group HEPA air clean group receive two HEPA air cleaner use 6-month follow-up period three home visit standard asthma education . Use air cleaner electronically monitor determine level `` dose '' air clean use family . The standard asthma education group ( delay HEPA Filter group ) receive three home visit deliver basic asthma education . All child receive baseline home inspection , 7-day home PM exposure monitoring , home dust allergen collection , skin testing , urine cotinine , spirometry , serum eosinophilia exhale NO testing . Caregivers child interview baseline 6-month follow-up regard ETS reduction behavior home , symptom frequency , asthma control , environmental exposure health care utilization outcomes . The primary outcome study reduction PM10 PM2.5 6 month follow-up . Secondary outcome include ETS reduction behavior change ( i.e . smoker smoke outside home , child sit smoker , reduction number household smoker ) , symptom free day health care utilization measure . If successful , intervention could significant clinical public health application pediatric asthma management child persistent asthma high ETS home exposure .</detailed_description>
