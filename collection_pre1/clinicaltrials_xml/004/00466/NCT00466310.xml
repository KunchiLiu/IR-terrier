	<brief_summary>We plan use metabolomics lipid platform map biochemical signature unmedicated schizophrenic patient prior 4 week post treatment antipsychotic drug aripiprazole compare lipid perturbation induce risperidone . These drug inherently different risk metabolic adverse effect patient respond differently . Metabolic signatures drug capture significant biochemical information could explain part basis vary drug response within individual highlight pathway implicate drug action disease pathogenesis possibly enable new drug design strategy .

	<brief_title>Metabolic Signatures Biomarkers Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia ( SCH ) devastate mental disease affect human population worldwide incidence 1 % . Most individual illness benefit long-term pharmacotherapy , however , therapeutic effect antipsychotic treatment inconsistent , incomplete , often counter significant side-effects associate long-term physical morbidity ( e.g. , tardive dyskinesia , obesity , hyperglycemia , hyperlipidemia . Metabolomics powerful new technology provide snap shot biochemical pathway particular point time . It earmark important area develop NIH roadmap initiative . We plan use platform map biochemical signature unmedicated schizophrenic patient prior 4 week post treatment antipsychotic drug aripiprazole compare lipid perturbation induce risperidone . These drug inherently different risk metabolic adverse effect patient respond differently . Metabolic signatures drug capture significant biochemical information could explain part basis vary drug response within individual highlight pathway implicate drug action disease pathogenesis possibly enable new drug design strategies.In addition , compare patient healthy control baseline regard lipid profile , ass whether lipid profile differ unmedicated schizophrenia patient healthy control .</detailed_description>
