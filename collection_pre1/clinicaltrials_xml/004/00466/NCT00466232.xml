	<brief_title>Phase I Study Weekly Topotecan Combination With Sorafenib Treatment Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) comprise approximately 15 percent lung cancer United States . It highly correlate tobacco use occur almost exclusively smoker . SCLC particularly virulent malignancy characterize rapid growth tendency metastasize early disease course . In first line treatment , SCLC high response rate cytotoxic chemotherapy . Unfortunately , disease develop drug resistance almost case result recurrence . In second line treatment , likelihood response treatment considerably less . Multiple agent use set response rate typically around 25 % median survival less 6 months1-3 . There clearly great need effective treatment disease . Topotecan semi-synthetic , water soluble derivative camptothecin , cytotoxic alkaloid extract plant genus Camptotheca . Its mechanism action inhibition topoisomerase I , enzyme necessary relieve torsional strain DNA necessary carry replication . This result DNA double-strand break ultimately cell death . Topotecan demonstrated activity number malignancy currently indicate treatment ovarian cancer , cervical cancer recurrent small cell lung cancer . Topotecan demonstrate single agent activity recurrent small cell lung cancer number trial . Reported response rate range 2 31 % 3-7 . A phase III trial compare topotecan CAV ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin vincristine ) treatment recurrent SCLC5 . Response rate , survival time progression similar group . The topotecan group demonstrate significant improvement symptom include anorexia , fatigue dyspnea . This lead FDA approval topotecan treatment recurrent SCLC . The dose limiting toxicity topotecan hematologic . The approved schedule administration 1.5mg/m2 daily x 5 every 21 day . A modified schedule weekly administration 4mg/m2 show similar efficacy less toxicity8 widely adopt clinical practice . Sorafenib oral multi-kinase inhibitor effect tumor proliferation tumor angiogenesis . It several biochemically important mechanism include inhibition Raf-1 B-Raf pivotal component Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signal pathway . It also inhibitory activity tyrosine kinases VEGF PDGFR well Flt-3 c-kit . Sorafenib safely combine full dose cytotoxic chemotherapy several Phase I trials9-11 . There data combination topotecan sorafenib date . Sorafenib metabolize liver undergoing oxidation via CYP3A4 glucuronidation via UGT1A9 . There evidence topotecan affect activity cytochrome P450 pathway suggest low likelihood drug-drug interaction . There significant overlap toxicity make ideal drug combination investigate .</detailed_description>
