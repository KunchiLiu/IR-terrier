	<brief_summary>This research do see combination sargramostim MS-275 help improve bone marrow function people myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . It also determine side effect combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study MS-275 , Combination With GM-CSF Treating Relapsed Refractory Myeloid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MDS abnormality bone marrow blood cell may develop cancer . AML cancer bone marrow blood cell . Both result problem make normal blood cell . The cell bone marrow undergo normal expect pattern growth maturation call “ differentiation. ” Because , work well . People problem often need blood transfusion high risk infection bleed . Treatment option MDS AML often limit due side effect . We hope develop combination drug help bone marrow function well without many side effect traditional chemotherapy treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In general , patient MDS relapse refractory AML , eligible potentially curative myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant consider poor candidate procedure due age , medical comorbidities , lack suitable donor , consider participation propose trial . Disease Specific MDS Relapsed AML Untreated AML Additional Criteria : 1 . Age &gt; 18 . 2 . JHOC confirm document diagnosis either AML MDS within 12 week trial enrollment . Patients MDS restrict IPSS INT2 high risk . 3 . Patients must relatively stable bone marrow function seven day prior enrollment study . WBC count double within seven day enrollment WBC great 10 x 103/dL would indicate unstable bone marrow function . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 5 . Patient caregiver must willing perform subcutaneous injection . 6 . Patients must follow end organ function : Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.6 mg/dL , unless secondary hemolysis . SGOT/SGPT &lt; 3 time upper limit normal unless disease relate Hemoglobin least 8 gm/dL time protocol entry . Patients may receive transfusion achieve level . 7 . Patients must receive treatment myeloid disorder within 2 week begin trial . Treatments include use chemotherapy , hematopoietic growth factor , biologic therapy monoclonal antibody . The exception use hydroxyurea patient WBC &gt; 30 x 103/μL . This duration time appear adequate wash due relatively shortacting nature antileukemia agent . 8 . Patients must recover toxicity ( grade 0 1 ) associate previous treatment . 9 . Patients must clinical symptom active CNS disease . If CNS disease suspect , patient must LP negative cytology . 10 . All woman potential child bearing must negative urine serum BHCG prior enrollment . 11 . All woman potential child bearing must agree use adequate birth control throughout trial period . All men must agree use barrier contraceptive throughout trial period . 12 . Patients must able provide inform consent return clinic adequate follow require protocol . 1 . Diagnosis RA 5q syndrome 2 . Peripheral leukemia blast count &gt; 30 x 103/dL , uncontrolled hydroxyurea . 3 . Age &lt; 18 4 . ECOG performance status &gt; 3 5 . Patients untreated progressive infection 6 . Patients active CNS disease 7 . Patients previous history intolerance GMCSF 8 . Pregnant lactating woman</criteria>
