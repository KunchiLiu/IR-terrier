	<brief_title>Study Effectiveness Cevimeline Oral Health Patients With Radiation Induced Xerostomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment advance head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCA ) require aggressive therapy often combine surgical intervention radiation therapy . Besides surveillance persistent recurrent cancer , clinicians seek help minimize side effect result aggressive treatment . Xerostomia , `` dry mouth '' , impact patient 's long term health quality life due significant diverse health consequence little saliva . Normal swallowing , speaking , resistance infection , taste acuity health domain affect dry mouth . Psycho-social functioning decrease many patient due extra effort communicate socialize ( Locker D 2004 ) . Xerostomia often consequence radiation treatment ( XRT ) , especially XRT field encompass parotid gland submandibular gland bilaterally . The disability consequence xerostomia extend beyond dysphagia , poor appetite secondary difficulty mastication , loss taste ( Chambers et al . Xerostomia 2004 ) . Since saliva essential normal oral flora healthy teeth , lack saliva patient dramatically rapidly result decline patient 's oral health . Dental complication occur present significant ongoing medical surgical problem . Our study propose use Oral Health Impact Profile , OHIP-49 , measure disease-specific quality life functional outcome due radiation relate xerostomia head neck cancer patient . The evaluation patient QOL concomitantly patient function propose SMILE protocol `` evidence study evaluate treatment effectiveness '' . The use patient-oriented outcome measure increasingly important health insurer government , measure also align World Health Organization 's mandate health resource manage must utilize preserved individual experience gain satisfaction living ( Epstein J.1986 ) . The OHIP-49 patient report outcome measure publicly available , validated adult population world-wide , use effectiveness measure . The question easy answer base upon 5 level likert type scale reflect frequency `` bother '' within individual psychosocial domain .</detailed_description>
