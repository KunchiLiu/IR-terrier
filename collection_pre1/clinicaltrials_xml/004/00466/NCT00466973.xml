	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation irregular heart rhythm require long term anticoagulation prevent risk stroke long term poor outcome . At time one heart surgery , small additional procedure do treat atrial fibrillation . Surgeons choice six different device use treat atrial fibrillation . It known point device best treating , device seem success rate cure atrial fibrillation . One six device select randomly card pulled time enrollment . It therefore purpose study compare device follow surgery determine one device best . This information valuable surgeon patient treatment atrial fibrillation develop future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery use treatment atrial fibrillation ( AF ) 20 year . Although highly successful , widely adopt operation design cure AF require extensive cut suture heart , inflict significant risk patient . Newer technology permit surgeon create similar scar heart cutting , much quickly safely . Over last ten year least six different device develop , scar heart : Microwave , radiofrequency , ultrasound , laser cold . Although many paper literature study device , seem cure 80 % patient low risk morbidity and/or mortality . This leave surgeon almost basis upon base selection device : Which best ? Which use ? Therefore , comparison study like desperately need . At time surgery , surgeon perform AF treatment , select one six device mention randomly assign earlier , time enrollment . The device use make scars heart exactly describe manufacturer ’ instruction accord surgeon ’ experience . The operation complete per routine . In word , part procedure do differently actual device choose perform ablation vary one study subject another . Patients follow upto one year EKGs , Holter monitor , MRI 's , 6 minute walk test , echocardiogram , blood test like bNP quality life questionnaire .</detailed_description>
