	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine wether RAD001 inhibit growth tumour cell and/or stop formation activity bone degrade osteoclast .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy RAD001 Breast Cancer Patients With Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RAD001 orally bioavailable well tolerate rapamycin ester analogue , act selectively inhibiting mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) . mTor intracellular protein kinase implicate control cellular proliferation neoplastic cell . Treatment RAD001 show inhibit signal event lead growth retardation tumour cell . In addition RAD001 vitro stop formation activity osteoclast . Therefore therapy advance breast cancer progressive bone metastasis seem reasonable RAD001 . Comparison : All patient receive RAD001 8 week run phase . Patients show response 8 week continue receive RAD001 . All patient stable disease run phase randomise receive either RAD001 placebo follow progression disease . Patients progressive disease 8 week run phase withdrawn trial .</detailed_description>
