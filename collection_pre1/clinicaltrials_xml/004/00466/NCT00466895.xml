	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Acute Leukemias Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Lenalidomide property thalidomide appear activity cancer laboratory test . Researchers still learn lenalidomide work cancer patient . Some way drug seem produce anti-cancer effect include stimulate immune system block blood vessel contribute cancer growth . The current study explore different dose level patient gather information lenalidomide . Purpose : This study assess maximum tolerate dose lenalidomide patient relapse refractory acute leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Toxicity side effect within patient also evaluate . Other purpose study include analyze preliminary clinical activity , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics . Pharmacokinetics refers activity drug body period time , include drug absorb , distribute , localized tissue , excrete . Pharmacodynamics refers bodily process lead drug effect cancer cellular component body . Treatment : Study participant give lenalidomide intravenous infusion every 28 day . A 28-day period constitutes cycle . Since study ass maximum tolerate dose lenalidomide , study participant receive different amount drug compare others depend upon individual enrolls study . Each group 3 6 study participant receive high dose lenalidomide maximum tolerate dose establish . Several test perform throughout study , include bone marrow biopsy . Imaging exams conduct well . Treatments discontinue due disease growth intolerable adverse effect . Lenalidomide administration repeat 12 cycle patient experience clinical benefit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Blood blast count must &lt; 40,000/uL prior initiation therapy . Hydroxyurea ( 6g/day ) may administer prior initiation therapy first week maintain blood blast count &lt; 40,000/uL ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status 02 . Patients CNS ( central nervous system ) involvement consider eligible study residual leukemic cell detect CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ) follow intrathecal chemotherapy radiation . Patients acute promyelocytic leukemia exclude unless patient fail salvage therapy arsenic . Patients HIV exclude due increase risk infectious complication , marrow suppression , potential interaction antiviral therapy . CLL patient chemotherapy ( exception hydroxyurea ) radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study exclude . CLL patient receive corticosteroid ( within 2 week ) treatment disease ( autoimmune manifestation CLL ) eligible . Patients receive mitomycin C nitrosourea require six week recovery period enrol current study . Patients follow abnormal clinical value exclude ( unless abnormality parameter directly attributable malignancy ) : Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl Total bilirubin &gt; 2 x upper limit normal ( unless due Gilbert 's syndrome ) ALT AST &gt; 5 x upper limit normal</criteria>
