	<brief_title>Sitagliptin Treatment Patients With Type 2 DM After Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within last six month , FDA approve sitagliptin phosphate oral drug potentiates effect native GLP-1 inhibition DPP-4 . It approve treatment type 2 diabetes adult monotherapy combination metformin TZD . It several advantage extenatide consider use kidney transplant recipient : 1 . It administer orally day 2 . Nausea occur rate 1.4 % 3 . Its potential hypoglycemia low However , may potent , term HbA1C % change HbA1C &lt; 1 % . In addition lot information gastric emptying , although probably severe exenatide , few symptom nausea report . We propose conduct pilot study use sitagliptin patient type 2 diabetes receive kidney transplant . Our objective study effect sitagliptin administration side effect profile , change HbA1C , percentage patient require discontinuation drug result major change immunosuppressant drug level . The data use preliminary data large study attempt prevent delay onset PTDM kidney transplant recipient . We anticipate treat patient impaired fast glucose normoglycemia , give high frequency PTDM post-kidney transplant population .</detailed_description>
