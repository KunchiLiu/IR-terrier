	<detailed_description>Serum marker unstable plaque Myeloperoxidase lysosomal enzyme , require heme cofactor , release neutrophilic granule , monocyte , subtypes tissue macrophage . Myeloperoxidase also link oxidation lipid low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , dysfunctional high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , consumption nitric oxide thereby render normally anti-thrombotic endothelial surface thrombogenic via expression various pro-thrombotic anti-fibrinolytic factor ( 19 ) . Myeloperoxidase play role degradation fibrous cap , make marker inflammation one plaque instability . Interest MPO intensify report Brennan colleague ( 20 ) indicate single initial measurement plasma myeloperoxidase independently predict early risk myocardial infraction , well risk major adverse cardiac event ensure 30-day 6-month period . Two marker recent interest relate plaque vulnerability pregnancy-associated protein A ( PAPP-A ) placenta growth factor ( P1GF ) . Pregnancy -associated protein A metalloproteinase , initially identify serum pregnant woman ( 21 ) . A large study illustrate decrease IGF-1 appear cardio protective , yet research show increase PAPP-A , also increase bioavailability IGF-1 , may relevant marker presence extent coronary atherosclerosis ( 22 ) . It believe PAPP-A release plaque destabilization appear valuable indicator unstable angina acute MI patient lack indicator necrosis ( 23 ) . Placenta growth factor , member vascular endothelial growth factor family , stimulate vascular smooth muscle growth , recruit macrophage atherosclerotic lesion , up-regulates production tumor necrosis factor- monocyte chemotactic protein 1 macrophage , stimulate pathological angiogenesis ( 24 ) . It appear initiator inflammatory process . In one study , elevate P1GF level identify patient acute chest pain develop ACS , also patient increase risk recurrent instability hospital discharge ( 25 ) . Plasma elevation CRP report fraction , acute ischemia myocardial fraction , predictive risk recurrent ischemia among hospitalization patient unstable angina ( 26 ) . Matrix metalloproteinases . MMPs diverse family powerful , zinc-containing enzyme express macrophage- derived foam cell , SMCs vascular cell within atherosclerotic lesion ( 27 ) .It previously demonstrate MMPs responsible remodel ECM stage atheromatous development may directly contribute fibrous cap weaken plaque rupture within disease artery ( 28 ) . CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) immunoregulatory transmembrane protein belong tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) super family . It express surface many cell type , include leukocyte , ECs , SMSs , macrophage , activate platelet ( 29 ) . Ligand receptor bind cell trigger expression secretion variety pro-inflammatory procoagulant mediator , include CAMs , cytokine , chemokines , growth factor , MMPs , TF ( 29 ) . Recent data suggest CD40L play central role inflammatory process contribute plaque destabilization CAD ( 30 ) , elevation soluble , biologically active CD40L ( Scd40l ) demonstrate serum ACS patient ( 31 ) . Paraoxonase atherogenic HDL The enzyme PON1 know tightly bind HDL serum , several study suggest association contributes protection confer HDL LDL oxidation ( 33-36 ) . The aim study find correlation serum marker unstable plaque virtual histology unstable plaque visualize IVUS . Patients method : Thirty patient schedule coronary angiography IVUS accord treat physician decision enrol study . The coronary angiography IVUS do accord regular clinical standard . As study protocol , 40 cc blood drawn patient write informed consent . The laboratory test process mention serum marker unstable plaque . A multivariate correlation test do different serum marker plaque morphology angiography composition ( virtual histology ) IVUS .</detailed_description>
