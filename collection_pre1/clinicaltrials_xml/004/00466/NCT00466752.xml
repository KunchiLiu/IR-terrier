	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study sorafenib tosylate gene expression patient undergoing surgery high-risk localized prostate cancer . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Studying sample blood tumor tissue laboratory patient prostate cancer may help doctor learn change occur DNA treatment sorafenib tosylate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Gene Expression Analysis Patients Undergoing Surgery For High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare gene expression change ( transcript profile ) pre- post-treatment tumor specimen order determine molecular impact multi-kinase inhibition prostate cancer . While analysis initially target tumor cell , gene expression change surround stromal tissue may also analyze . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine specific downstream protein effector ( i.e . ERK , AKT , S6- kinase ) Sorafenib kinase target affect change protein phosphorylation immunohistochemistry . II . To provide evidence Sorafenib significant anti-tumor effect comparison pre- post-treatment immunohistochemical marker apoptosis ( caspase-3 ) , cell proliferation ( Ki-67 ) , angiogenesis ( microvessel density ) . III . To determine pathologic complete response rate , define absence cancer prostatectomy specimen . IV . To determine rate positive surgical margin , extracapsular extension , seminal vesicle lymph node involvement tumor comparison Memorial Sloan Kettering pre-operative nomogram prediction . V. To determine percentage patient &gt; = 25 % &gt; = 50 % decline PSA receive Sorafenib . VI . To determine tissue Sorafenib level prostate tumor treatment correlate molecular , clinical , and/or pathologic outcome . VII . To describe change overall histology treatment Sorafenib correlate molecular clinical outcome . VIII . To determine patient baseline alteration phospho-ERK , phospho-AKT , phospho-S6-kinase expression correlate treatment related molecular , clinical , and/or pathologic outcome . IX . To collect tissue sample future analysis correlative biomarkers prognosis treatment response . X . To collect frozen plasma future analysis correlative biomarkers treatment response ( genetic analysis perform specimen ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 1 2 day completion sorafenib tosylate , patient undergo radical prostatectomy approximately day 43 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6-10 week .</detailed_description>
