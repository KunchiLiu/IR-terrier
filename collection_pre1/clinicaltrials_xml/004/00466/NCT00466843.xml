	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) rare , potentially serious bone marrow disease . Currently available treatment MDS somewhat beneficial . The purpose study determine effect medication antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) adult MDS determine individual MDS likely benefit treatment ATG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Antithymocyte Globulin Adults With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In people MDS , bone marrow stop make healthy blood cell instead produce poorly functioning , malformed , immature blood cell . This lead anemia result healthy red blood cell , infection result healthy white blood cell , bleed result healthy platelet . The exact cause MDS remain unknown , may cause abnormal autoimmune activity activate T cell , type white blood cell , prevent normal bone marrow production . ATG , medication inhibits immune function , restore normal blood production people MDS , know happens happen MDS patient . The purpose study examine effect ATG adult MDS determine individual MDS likely benefit treatment ATG . Based disease severity likely disease progression , participant separate either high-risk group low-risk group . Participants hospitalize 4-day period receive daily infusion ATG . Oral prednisone give 2 day hospitalization , throughout hospitalization , 14 day hospitalization limit side effect ATG . Antihistamines acetaminophen also give hospitalization reduce chance allergic reaction ATG . After discharge , participant attend monthly study visit include blood collection , review disease symptom , evaluation medication response . At Week 16 , participant high-risk group undergo additional blood collection , bone marrow biopsy , thorough evaluation disease progression effect MDS daily live ability . Participants low-risk group undergo procedures Week 24 . Follow-up participant may last 2 year .</detailed_description>
