	<brief_summary>Twenty , house dust mite ( HDM ) -allergic non-smoking subject without mild asthma age 18-50 recruit . The primary endpoint nasal eosinophilia . Each volunteer screen skin testing , pulmonary function test induced sputum . If eligible return baseline nasal allergen challenge lavage . Approximately two week later return gamma tocopherol ( gT ) dose visit . After complete 14 day daily high dose ( 1200mg ) gT , return second nasal allergen challenge . This visit also include pulmonary function test blood draw . The purpose study determine high dose gamma tocopherol therapy reduce allergen induce nasal inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect House Dust Mite Allergen Challenge Persons Using 1200 mg Gamma Tocopherol Supplements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This do use single-group , prospective , descriptive proof concept study design ( Phase I ) HDM-allergic adult undergo baseline nasal allergen challenge nasal lavage , receive 2 week treatment gT follow second challenge nasal lavage . Primary outcome : Post-treatment change concentration house dust mite-induced eosinophil nasal lavage fluid ( NLF ) , compare pre-treatment baseline . Secondary outcome : ( ) NLF inflammatory mediator include eicosanoid product COX-2 pathway , inflammatory cytokine relevant innate immunity allergic inflammation , cell eosinophils include neutrophil , total protein ; ( b ) similar endpoint induce sputum ; ( c ) sub-analysis data subject mild asthma . Safety outcomes : Post-treatment change coagulation marker ( PT , PTT ) . Study Protocol : Visit 1 ( Screening ) : Study subject consent protocol schedule initial baseline screen visit include urine pregnancy test , medical history physical exam , immediate-hypersensitivity skin test D. farinae common allergen , baseline spirometry , nasal lavage cell differential cytokine , induce sputum cell differential cytokine , venipuncture 30ml blood complete blood , count coagulation factor , cytokine vitamin level . Visit 2 : Allergen challenge visit occur within 2 month screen . Medical history include medication review . Urine pregnancy test , physical exam , baseline nasal symptom score obtain prior challenge . Study volunteer undergo grade nasal allergen challenge D. farinae use leave naris symptom score record dose . Nasal allergen challenge provide grade dose fashion 0 AU , 100 AU , 500 AU 1,000 AU separate 15 minute . Dilutions provide University North Carolina Hospitals Investigational Drug Service . Over 10 minute , symptom monitor score , base symptom allergen challenge nostril . If positive clinical symptom , increase concentration dust mite allergen dilution deposit nose . Nasal challenge saline give contralateral nostril similar volume use allergen challenge follow spirometry vital sign . Subjects remain research lab undergo vital sign spirometry 4 hour post challenge investigator 's discretion . Nasal lavage occur 4 hour allergen challenge measurement note . If volunteer sputum producer first visit , sputum induction perform , also 4 hour nasal allergen challenge . Venipuncture complete blood count coagulation factor , cytokine vitamin level also collect . Visit 2a : This visit occur within 24 hr Visit 2 . Volunteer vital sign record , review symptom , physical examination spirometry . Visit 3 ( Initial dose visit ) : This visit occur least 2 week Visit 2 . Any change medical history , medication adverse event ( AE 's ) since prior visit review . Urine pregnancy test perform female child bear potential . Subjects receive 14 day supply ( 28 softgel capsule , approximately 600 gram gT ) dispense University North Carolina Hospitals Investigational Drug Service provide YASOO Medical . Subjects observed take initial oral dose 2 softgel capsule ( approximately 1200 gram ) gT discharge home individual oral dos study drug follow 13 day . Subjects give daily medication diary record dose take change health medication . Visit 4 : This visit safety visit 6-8 day gT therapy . The subject undergo vital sign measurement , spirometry physical exam specifically focus sign bruise bleeding . Venipuncture ( approximately 10ml ) perform obtain CBC coagulation factor since high dose gT theoretically may affect platelet function coagulation . Visit 5 : After two week daily gT subject volunteer return another nasal allergen challenge . Medical history update , AE 's new medication since visit 4 reviewed . Pregnancy test , spirometry vital sign perform . After baseline nasal symptom score obtain grade nasal allergen challenge perform visit 2 . Spirometry perform challenge assure volunteer tolerate allergen challenge . Nasal lavage perform 4 hour allergen challenge measurement note . If volunteer sputum producer previous visit , sputum induction 4 hour allergen challenge measurement . Venipuncture blood study ( include safety lab ) indicate visit perform . Visit 5a : This visit occur within 24 hour Visit 2 . Volunteer undergo vital sign measurement , review symptom , physical exam spirometry . Visit 6 : Five ten day challenge , volunteer return discontinuation visit include vital sign , physical exam spirometry .</detailed_description>
