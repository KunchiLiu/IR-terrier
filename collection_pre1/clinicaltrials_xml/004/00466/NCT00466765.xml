	<brief_title>Breast Reconstruction Augmentation With Brava Enhanced Autologous Fat Micro Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure : Urine pregnancy test perform designated procedure study . Patients question underlying renal disease exclude existent . Pre-operative/baseline digital 35mm photo obtain utilizing standard criterion perform routinely plastic reconstructive surgeon surgical procedure . Oblique , frontal sagittal view store protected file . Optional : Patients preoperative breast MRI contrasting agent Gadolinium , utilize 1.5 Tesla MRI machine breast coil unless status post breast cancer pre-operative MRI need . All reading perform board certify radiologist . Brava domes worn bilaterally 3-4 week surgery 10-12 hour per day , 7 day week 24 hour wear final 72 hour ( 3 day ) surgery . Patients require adhere dome cleaning process specify manufacturer . This prudent hygienic reason reduce skin irritation infection . The dome single patient use . Pressure range 15 mmHg 105mmHg achieve regulate either SmartBox , bulb syringe and/or Brava Turbo device . This open tissue plane maximally expand recipient breast preparation graft insertion . Institutional Review Board approval obtain patient properly advise right via sign Informed Consents . All patient assess board certify plastic reconstructive surgeon autologous fat harvesting site . Preoperative sedation IV sedation and/or oral sedation recommend . Preoperative antibiotic , Keflex similar drug , administer surgery . Sterile drape prep fat harvest site carry . Tumescent anesthetic solution prepare dilute 50cc 's 1 % lidocaine 1/100,000 unit epinephrine 1000cc 's Ringers Lactate solution instill 14-gauge infusion infiltration cannula area fat harvest . Gentle , low vacuum pressure manual liposuction perform avoid damaging fat cell . Liposuction perform standard fashion use 12G &amp; 12 side hole harvest cannula connect syrinx maintain control constant low vacuum pressure 300 mmHg ( preferably use K-VAC ( Vacuum Assisted Device ) syringe ) . The aspirate purge syrinx collection bag use atraumatic nonclogging valve ( preferably AT-Valve ) 3 way stopcock . Once fill , bag spin low speed ( &lt; 1000 rpm ) separate fat serum ( free oil , ) . The infranatant serum drain cellular fat supernatant concentrate bag directly re-injected breast . Depending upon volume correction require recipient space available , 100 500 ml gently centrifuge ( non-packed ) fat inject per breast . The recipient breast mark carefully prior infiltration anesthetic determine prefer graft distribution pattern select 9-18 graft insertion site ( circumareolar , inframammary , axillary circumference breast ) . The skin infiltrate graft insertion sit Naropin 2 % ( ropivacine ) . After recipient site anesthetize , puncture site make 14-gauge needle . A 14-gauge blunt tip cannula similar cannula connect 3 ml syringe use gently inject small droplet distally first subsequently proximally cannula withdrawn . Repeated pass multiple level radial fashion perform puncture site graft droplet lay criss-crossing pattern multiple plane . Avoid glandular tissue remain subcutaneous plane volume need available proceed fill subglandular , intramuscular submuscular plane . Incision sit cover sterile band aid apply skin . Gentle conform dressing apply breast . Elastic garment place harvest site . Postoperative instruction hand patient . Patient begin wear Brava System , SmartBox device , 18 hour post-operative stabilization device . For first three ( 3 ) day system worn 24 hour day maximum tolerate . If patient note pain , system may remove replace hour later . The System wear 10 12 hour day one additional week ( 7 day ) . Then patient may choose proceed prolonged intermittent wear 10 hour per day 10 - 14 week . Follow-up include : A call surgical team within 24 hour surgery . An office follow visit within 48-72 hour surgery follow-up appointment 6 month . More office follow visit interim recommended mandatory . A one-year post graft mammogram recommend woman age 40 .</detailed_description>
