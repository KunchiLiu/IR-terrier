	<brief_summary>The purpose study find new way control malaria look mosquito infected disease . Knowledge genetics affect spread malaria mosquito help develop control strategy . A small amount blood infect human use infect mosquito . No contact occur human subject mosquito . Study participant divide 2 group 20 , total 40 child , age 5-10 , Burkina Faso , West Africa . Each subject screen finger-prick per month , June October , reach maximum age 10 . Two positive subject 40 screen ask donate 1 teaspoon blood , use feed infect mosquito . Study participant involve study related procedure maximum 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria blood-borne human disease , transmit mosquito bloodmeal , obligatory step human malaria transmission . This study malaria parasites major mosquito vector human malaria Africa , Anopheles gambiae . The intent study develop modern form vector control would specifically decrease disease transmission target vector . Genetic linkage mapping mosquito vector ( Anopheles gambiae ) Africa identify small genomic region mosquito control natural genetic variation resistance mosquito infection human malaria parasite ( Plasmodium falciparum ) . In order study influence mosquito vector genetics transmission malaria parasite , mosquito expose malaria parasite efficiency parasite development within mosquito measure . The goal study promote expand non-transmitting subset vector population order decrease interrupt human malaria transmission . The study focus mosquito vector , human subject infect malaria . The reason use human subject 5cc blood human subject naturally infect malaria use infect mosquito indirect feed method involve membrane feeding device . There contact human subject mosquito . The blood-fed mosquito primary focus study , human subject . DNA extract mosquito feed blood human study subject analyze genetically microsatellites single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) identify mosquito gene control mosquito resistance malaria parasite . The genetic analysis mosquito DNA , DNA human subject . At time mosquito analyze , one week bloodmeal , residual genetic , DNA , cellular , material human subject remain within mosquito , thus genetic information derive human source , even accidentally . A secondary objective identify naturally-occurring mechanism mosquito resistance malaria infection Burkina Faso . Mosquitoes infect malaria parasite transmit malaria . Research identify gene resistance may lead method block transmission malaria . A total enrollment 40 healthy volunteer , 5-10 year old , plan one site Burkina Faso , West Africa . Malaria transmission occur rainy season ( June October ) . There 2 experimental cycle per month June October ( 10 cycle per year ) . There two group 20 , total study size 40 . Each group 20 screen malaria alternate pattern , group 20 screen frequently per month malaria transmission season , total study duration 5 year . One human subject mature malaria gametocyte ( transmission stage infective mosquito ) identify day project experimental infection mosquito . Blood ( 5 cc ) drawn subject , occur frequently per month . Twenty subject screen malaria parasite ( standard diagnosis ) insure find least one positive donor per cycle . The 5cc blood use feed infect mosquito , subject study . Subject participation approximately 5 month per year , total study duration 5 year . A target sample size 200 mosquito set 150 marker analyze study . A successful outcome study genetic identification mosquito gene control resistance susceptibility P. falciparum infection mosquito .</detailed_description>
