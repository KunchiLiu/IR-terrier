	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection know cause hearing loss mental retardation . The purpose study compare 6-week course 6-month course drug valganciclovir baby bear CMV assess safety efficacy treatment . Participants include 104 infant ( 30 day old young ) bear CMV disease . All infant take valganciclovir mouth 6 week . At end 6 week period , subject assign chance receive either valganciclovir placebo ( inactive substance ) complete 6 month antiviral treatment . Patients follow study related evaluation safety , change hear , developmental milestone 2 year . Patients follow telephone contact additional 3 year . Thus , participant may involve study related procedure approximately 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , prospective , international , Phase III , randomize blind investigation 6 week versus 6 month oral valganciclovir therapy baby symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) disease . Following enrollment , study subject receive 6 week oral valganciclovir . Near end 6-week course , subject randomize 1:1 fashion either continue valganciclovir complete 6 month therapy begin match placebo complete 6 month . Study subject stratify accord whether central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement study entry . During 6-month treatment period 1 month thereafter , study subject follow weekly 4 week , every week 8 week , every month 4 month . At visit , safety lab check , growth parameter record , adverse event assess . The dose study medication adjust weight gain study visit . Dose adjustment may also occur indicated per protocol neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , renal impairment . Whole blood obtain CMV viral load visit well . Hearing outcome assessed baseline , 6 month , 12 month 24 month . Developmental outcome assess 12 month 24 month . Changes whole blood viral load measurement correlate hear neurologic outcome . In study subject increase whole blood viral load course treatment , assessment antiviral resistance may undertaken.Safety assessment include : hematology lab , chemistry lab , physical examination , adverse event data performed/collected serially . Development neutropenia confirm repeat blood test within one week , study drug hold resolve . Efficacy assessment include : hearing assessment baseline , 6 month , 12 month 24 month ; neurodevelopmental assessment 12 month 24 month . Study objective : compare impact hear outcomes 6 week versus 6 month antiviral treatment valganciclovir oral solution infant symptomatic congenital CMV disease ; compare safety profile 6 week versus 6 month antiviral therapy valganciclovir oral solution infant symptomatic congenital CMV disease ; compare impact neurologic outcomes 6 week versus 6 month antiviral treatment valganciclovir oral solution infant symptomatic congenital CMV disease ; correlate change whole blood viral load hear neurologic outcome . Participants include 104 male female neonate ( less equal 30 day ) symptomatic congenital CMV .</detailed_description>
