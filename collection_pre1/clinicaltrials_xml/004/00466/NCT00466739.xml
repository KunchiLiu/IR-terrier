	<brief_summary>In symptomatic asymptomatic disease , half medicine take prescribed1 . Relatively little known patient Parkinson 's disease take medication . One challenge management Parkinson 's disease prevention treatment involuntary movements2,3 wild fluctuation mobile able function slow , stiff unable move recurs delay ( several year ) effect take antiparkinson medication . One theory occur due pulsatile rather continuous delivery medication brain4 . If patient take medicine erratically irregularly , cause fluctuation blood therefore brain drug level may prime patient complication future . This project define extent irregular medication take Parkinson 's disease , examine associate clinical demographic characteristic examine ease adherence different drug regime . Knowledge therapy adherence help support patient use medicine best effect . In present document term compliance adherence use equal meaning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational study patient Parkinson 's disease take medication . Antiparkinson medication monitor use electronic pill bottle , MEMS , AardexÂ® , Switzerland ( contain microprocessor cap record time date bottle opening ) . This give information amount prescribe medication take ( total compliance ) , percentage day correct number dos take ( daily compliance ) , percentage dos take correct time interval ( time compliance ) . Five country involve , ( UK , Germany , Italy , Spain France ) . The total number patient recruit across Europe 144 . The study size calculate base single centre study Glasgow 2/3 120 patient schedule undergo electronic monitoring part different study design . Accordingly data available inform expected number patient complete study ( around 10 % drop rate ) order test 6 key variable potential influence therapy compliance use general statistical guide 10 20 patient study per variable examine , sample size around 120 evaluable patient calculate .</detailed_description>
