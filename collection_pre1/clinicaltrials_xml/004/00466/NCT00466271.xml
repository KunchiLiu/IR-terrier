	<brief_title>Prediction Significant Hepatic Fibrosis HCV Carriers With PNALT SAPI- A Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection major health problem , affect 170 million person worldwide . Approximately 25-30 % patient chronic hepatitis C persistently normal alanine aminotransferase ( PNALT ) level , another 40 % ALT level less twice upper limit normal ( ULN ) . PNALT generally define least three normal ALT level document least 2 month apart period 6 month . Although natural history HCV carrier PNALT level remain unclear , may mild necroinflammation mild fibrosis liver histology , rate disease progression slow patient elevate ALT level . However , patient PNALT level still present advanced fibrosis even cirrhosis . A recent study show combine pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin treatment HCV carrier PNALT level achieve comparable sustained virological response ( SVR ) elevate ALT level , suggest antiviral therapy could initiate irrespective ALT level . Furthermore , patient initial diagnosis significant fibrosis liver biopsy harbor high risk advance fibrosis cirrhosis , may merit antiviral therapy stop delay progression hepatic fibrosis . Currently , liver biopsy recognize gold standard assess grade necroinflammation stage fibrosis initiation antiviral therapy . However , costly harbor risk complication . In addition , sample error due non-uniform distribution parenchymal damage , well intra- inter-observer variability often encounter . A noninvasive tool evaluate liver disease activity fibrosis stage helpful , particularly monitoring HCV carrier time . Studies assess usefulness noninvasive test predict hepatic fibrosis mainly perform patient elevated ALT level . In patient PNALT level , three study address value Fibroscan , Fibro Test aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) platelet ratio index ( APRI ) . However , Fibro Test costly Fibroscan widely use . In addition , APRI show cohort patient PNALT level possess excellent diagnostic accuracy reproducibility ( 32 ) . Currently , splenic arterial pulsatility index ( SAPI ) show superior diagnostic accuracy various biochemical index ( include APRI , API ( age-platelet index ) , AAR ( AST ALT ratio ) ) predict significant hepatic fibrosis HCV carrier PNALT . However , SAPI validate independently prospective cohort confirm diagnostic accuracy reproducibility . Therefore , study aim validate diagnostic accuracy reproducibility SAPI predict significant hepatic fibrosis HCV patient PNALT schedule receive combination therapy pegylated interferon plus ribavirin percutaneous liver biopsy .</detailed_description>
