	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cetuximab together celecoxib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cetuximab together celecoxib work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer colorectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine time progression patient unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer treat cetuximab celecoxib . Secondary - Determine response rate , median survival , 1-year survival rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . - Determine feasibility test urinary PGE-M patient treat regimen . - Determine feasibility test serum transform growth factor-α amphiregulin patient treat regimen . - Determine effect regimen EGFR pathway tumor cell ( i.e. , phosphorylated EGFr , phosphorylated AKT , activate mitogen-activated protein kinase ) . - Determine effect regimen cyclooxygenase-2 pathway tumor cell measure PGE-2 level . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour weekly oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Serum urine sample collect baseline , week 1 , every course thereafter evaluation PGE-2 mass spectrometry , cyclooxygenase-2 activity , phospho-EGFR level western blot analysis immunohistochemistry . Samples also analyze TGF-α amphiregulin proteomics . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 54 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm colorectal cancer metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; equal 20 mm conventional technique &gt; equal 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must progress least 1 chemotherapy regimen advance disease . No prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway . Age 18 year old ECOG performance status ≤ 2 . Life expectancy great 3 month . Normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,500/μl platelet ≤ 100,000/μl total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &gt; equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal &gt; equal 5.0 time normal liver metastasis present creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal The effect cetuximab and/or celecoxib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dos unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness provide write informed consent . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody Serum calcium &gt; 12.0 mg/dl . Patients must selective nonselective COX2 inhibitor least 2 week prior study entry ( exception 81 mg daily aspirin ) . No major surgery within 4 week . No minor surgery ( laparoscopy , thoracoscopy , port placement ) within 1 week . Patients must &gt; 4 week prior pelvic radiation recover side effect . Patients must &gt; 1 week prior palliative radiation recover side effect . Prior treatment EGFR target therapy . Significant traumatic injury occur within 28 day prior treatment . Gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study cetuximab epidermal growth factor inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect base data suggest EGFR expression important normal organ development . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother cetuximab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated cetuximab . Patients know HIV disease .</criteria>
