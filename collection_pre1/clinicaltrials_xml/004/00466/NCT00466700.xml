	<brief_summary>H. pylorus infection cause stomach become inflamed . The problem usually begin childhood lead stomach problem adult life . Study participants resident The Gambia , West Africa , study Medical Research Council Great Britain facility Fajara , The Gambia . Up 75 adult 18 year old 20 malnourish child 6 month 2 year age , undergo endoscopy part medical care , study . ( Endoscopy thin , light device use look inside body . ) During study procedure , tiny piece tissue , call biopsy , take stomach check H. pylori infection . Participants find infected give antibiotic treatment . Participation study last approximately 72 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal pilot project implement evaluate new method isolate Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylorus ) strain young child , compare isolates obtain adult population . This part I study , part II describe Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases protocol 06-0004 . The transition childhood colonization adult disease state may affect multiple factor include evolution genotype colonize H. pylorus strain , drive part host response infection . The hypothesis H. pylorus strain Gambian child differ genetically strain chronically colonize adult community . Genetic phenotypic characterization pediatric adult H. pylorus isolate test fundamental difference strain circulate 2 age group , thereby help evaluate importance strain selection and/or genome evolution high risk society . Specific objective : compare range genotype obtain H. pylorus culture gastric biopsy Gambian adult child undergo diagnostic upper endoscopy , obtained culture gastric juice aspirate subject . This allow interpretation result obtained culture nasogastric aspirate child require diagnostic endoscopy , compare gastric biopsy-derived H. pylorus isolates . Most genotyping entail polymerase chain reaction test virulence marker , limited ( focus ) DNA sequencing , test susceptibility metronidazole frequency forward mutation . The study population consist resident The Gambia , West Africa . Up seventy five adult sexes age , undergo diagnostic endoscopy part clinical management , 20 malnourish child sex le 2 year age , undergo diagnostic endoscopy part clinical management , study . All subject study Medical Research Council Great Britain research laboratories clinical facility Fajara , The Gambia . The main outcome measure degree relatedness bacterial isolates . This assessed visual comparison random amplification polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) result , comparison genotype alleles interest , definitively sequence housekeep gene construct phylogenetic tree relatedness , use STAR program ( computer program put DNA sequence together analysis ) multiple locus sequence typing ( MLST ) database . There outcome measure human subject . All laboratory investigation conduct upon bacterial isolates .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult Subjects : All consent subject refer diagnostic upper endoscopy Medical Research Council ( MRC ) unit Fajara eligible inclusion , provide none exclusion criterion apply . In The Gambia , subject age 18 year consider adult . Subjects sample . Child Subjects : All subject 2 year age refer diagnostic upper endoscopy MRC unit Fajara eligible inclusion , provide parent give informed consent none exclusion criterion apply . The minimum cutoff age study 6 month . Adult Subjects : Any contraindication endoscopy biopsy , liver dysfunction , history bleeding , history serious organ disease ( example , kidney , heart , lung ) , bleed time prolong 10 minute , unexpected finding esophageal gastric stricture limit endoscopic examination exclude subject study , use antibiotic previous 2 week . Specific test bleed time perform discretion supervise clinician , undertaking diagnostic endoscopy subject 's clinical benefit . In addition , endoscopist feel prolong procedure 2 3 minute order take research biopsy would advisable reason , subject exclude study .
