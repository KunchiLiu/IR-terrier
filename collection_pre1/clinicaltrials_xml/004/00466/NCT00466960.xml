	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Colony stimulate factor , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow may also increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving GM-CSF together paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation may effective treatment ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give GM-CSF together paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation work treat patient advanced ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer respond previous chemotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sargramostim Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether chronic GM-CSF administration cytotoxic chemotherapy paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation induce long remission experience recent platinum-containing regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine extent chronic GM-CSF administration increase number activate monocytes patient advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer . II . To determine extent chronic GM-CSF administration increase number activation state peripheral circulate antigen present cell , dendritic cell activate monocyte , patient advance epithelial ovarian cancer . III . To determine extent chronic GM-CSF administration increase number functional status T cell recognize tumor specific antigens patient advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer . IV . To determine extent chronic GM-CSF administration increase number functional status antigen specific T cell recognize foreign pathogen patient advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive GM-CSF subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 16-26 . Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4-6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning 14 day last GM-CSF injection , patient receive GM-CSF SC daily day 1-15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 6 month every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal malignancy , exclude tumor low malignant potential ( borderline ) Patients follow histologic epithelial cell type eligible : serous adenocarcinoma , endometrioid adenocarcinoma , mucinous adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , clear cell adenocarcinoma , mixed epithelial carcinoma , transitional cell carcinoma , malignant Brenner 's Tumor , adenocarcinoma otherwise specified Patients must either primary platinum refractory resistant carcinoma secondary platinum resistant disease : 1 . Primary platinum refractory disease define progression disease initial platinumbased chemotherapy persistent disease conclusion initial platinumbased chemotherapy course associate primary debulking surgery . 2 . Primary platinum resistant disease define recurrence carcinoma within 6 month ( + 14 day ) completion initial platinumbased chemotherapy associate primary debulking surgery . ( The 14 day window allow study entry patient evidence clearly suggest assessment make early patient would meet 6 month time line . This determine study principal investigator [ P.I . ] ) 3 . Secondary platinum resistant disease define meet one list criterion follow subsequent platinum contain regimen .
