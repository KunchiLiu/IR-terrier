	<brief_summary>With upright posture , immediate redistribution blood dependent circulation ; venous return central venous filling pressure reduce , result diminution cardiac output blood pressure . These hemodynamic alteration stimulate baroreceptor reflex , mediate via central nervous system increase peripheral sympathetic vasomotor tone , restore blood pressure cardiac output within seconds-to-minutes assumption upright position . Following SCI , individual often experience inability adjust postural change due disruption central command baroreceptor reflex reduction efferent sympathetic neural pathway ; consequently , orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) symptoms cerebral hypo-perfusion may ensue . OH well-documented phenomenon , characterize fall systolic blood pressure &gt; 20 mmHg diastolic BP &gt; 10 mmHg within 3 minute assumption upright posture . As consequence OH , many individual experience symptom cerebral hypo-perfusion include lightheadedness , dizziness , blurry vision , fatigue , nausea , ring ear , cognitive impairment heart palpitation . Although several investigator report increased prevalence OH acute phase spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , individual chronic injury also experience significant fall blood pressure seat upright posture . This investigation examine effect alpha-agonist , midodrine hydrochloride , head-up tilt systemic blood pressure , cerebral blood flow cerebral oxygenation compare placebo administration person chronic SCI demonstrate significant orthostatic hypotension 24-hour observation study . This first study determine dose response efficacy midodrine improve orthostatic blood pressure cerebral blood flow oxygenation SCI population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Response Trial Using 5 10 Mg Midodrine Hydrochloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In individual SCI , blood pressure regulation alter compare non-SCI population relate degree sympathetic vascular denervation . The inadequate release norepinephrine postural change primary component OH several report document significantly reduce plasma norepinephrine level individual tetraplegia . Ephedrine sulfate midodrine hydrochloride , 1 receptor agonist , recommend treatment postural hypotension population . Although case report document improve blood pressure regulation person SCI treat 1 receptor agonist , pharmacological treatment OH adequately study population . A dose response trial use determine efficacy midodrine hydrochloride ( 5 10 mg ) compare drug improve systemic blood pressure , cerebral blood flow oxygenation reduce symptomatic hypotension tilt-table test 16 individual SCI manifest significant orthostatic hypotension ( total time [ minute ] spent hypotension [ 20 % fall mean arterial pressure supine laboratory observation ] 24-hour observation . Subjects receive , increase dose manner separate day : drug , 5 10 mg oral midodrine hydrochloride . Oral ingestion pill ( placebo midodrine ) 30 minute 60 minute supine rest period prior head-up tilt maneuver . A progressive head-up tilt utilized table adjust 15 , 25 , 35 5 minute angle maintain 45 45 minute subject experience symptom compromise cerebral blood flow , include , limited , light headedness , blurry vision , dizziness nausea . Throughout test day , measurement heart rate , blood pressure , middle cerebral blood flow velocity , cerebral oxygenation obtain . In addition , blood draw complete capture humoral factor responsible blood pressure regulation .</detailed_description>
