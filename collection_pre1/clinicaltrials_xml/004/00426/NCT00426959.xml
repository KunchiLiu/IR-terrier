	<brief_summary>This phase I study . This phase I study standard drug dose escalation study , rather Clinical System Performance Evaluation Trial therapeutic device . However purpose protocol refer portion trial phase I study . The purpose study demonstrate feasibility clinical practicability register ultrasound fluoroscopy ( RUF ) combination CMS Interplant system® initial cohort 6 patient . This involve demonstrate feasibility use system actual operating room environment well obtain preliminary assessment accuracy performance source location algorithm compare postoperative CT dosimetry . The Primary endpoint study evaluation feasibility use RUF system perform real-time optimization operate room environment . The Secondary endpoint study : 1 . Acute late toxicity assess IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires multiple follow-up interval . 2 . PSA-free survival . Study Population : The target population patient diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate see consultation Johns Hopkins Hospital . Approximately 360 patient per year diagnosis prostate cancer see Department Radiation Oncology Johns Hopkins Hospital . Of patient , approximately 45 % low-risk ( T1a-T2a , Gleason 6 less , PSA 10 ng/ml less ) intermediate-risk disease suitable brachytherapy base disease risk . Within group patient , approximately 70 % eligible brachytherapy base gland size prior transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) . Approximately 80 % patient offer brachytherapy consultation decide receive treatment Johns Hopkins . Overall , currently perform 2 brachytherapy procedure per week average , yearly total approximately 90 case . For purpose homogeneity treatment patient population , protocol enroll patient currently treat institution brachytherapy alone , enroll patient ( intermediate high risk disease ) require external beam radiation addition brachytherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective Phase I study . Subject Identification : Patient confidentiality maintain accordance Health Information Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) guideline . All participant must sign informed consent describe objective study potential risk . All patient data report case report form identify patient 's initial study code number only.Patients shall identify name . This serve protect confidentiality subject enrol trial . Clinical data record subject study include history physical finding , laboratory data , result intervention maintain investigator secure , lock location . Computerized data require password authorization ( ) access . Description Recruitment Process : Potential subject identify time consultation Department Radiation Oncology Dr. Song Dr. DeWeese . If Dr. DeWeese identify potential patient consult refer Dr. Song Dr. Song offer patient opportunity participate . Dr. DeWeese offer patient opportunity participate assist identify potential patient research team see many brachytherapy case consultation . Description Informed Consent Process : Only principal investigator list co-investigators perform inform consent interview . The informed consent interview take place patient treat ensure patient adequate time discuss research project family , friend , and/or Health Care provider . During informed consent interview interviewer ( investigator ) take much time need ensure potential subject understands research project also clearly understands participate project receive cancer treatment Johns Hopkins . If patient decides enroll research project sign three copy inform consent form . One record , one keep Clinical Research Office Johns Hopkins , third one keep medical record . Subject Assignment : 6 patient enrol onto trial . The patient brachytherapy plan use register ultrasound fluoroscopy ( RUF ) combination CMS Interplant system® . Screening Procedures Standard Brachytherapy : - History physical KPS time consultation . - Volume prostate base ultrasound time diagnostic biopsy . If available , patient prostatic volume estimate digital rectal examination time consultation confirmatory ultrasound perform clinic . - Tumors grade Gleason score provide pathology report . - Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) . - CT scan pelvis . Nodes evaluate negative imaging method classify NX.Only nodes evaluated negative surgical sampling classify N0 . - Bone scan optional , give low risk positive finding population . - IPSS Symptom Score time consultation . Clinical Assessments : Once inform consent obtain follow assessment perform subject : - Pre-Treatment Evaluation ( perform within 6 week prior day 1 brachytherapy ) : . History Physical ii . IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires ( See Appendix 1 questionnaire ) . iii . Serum PSA iv . Chest X-Ray v. Bone Scan ( clinically indicate ) vi . CT pelvis vii . Ultrasound volume ( do 4 week 4 day prior day 1 brachytherapy ) - Day 1 Brachytherapy : . Chest X-Ray &gt; ii . CT Pelvis &gt; &gt; These study do day Brachytherapy - Day 30 : 30 day ( +/- 7 day ) Brachytherapy : . History Physical ii . IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires iii . Serum PSA iv . CT Pelvis v. Chest X-Ray - Month 3 : 3 month ( +/- 2 week ) Brachytherapy : . History Physical ii . IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires iii . Serum PSA iv . Chest X-Ray - Month 6 : 6 month ( +/- 4 week ) Brachytherapy : . History Physical ii . IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires iii . Serum PSA - Month 9 : 9 month ( +/- 4 week ) Brachytherapy : . History Physical ii . IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires iii . Serum PSA - Month 12 : 12 month ( +/- 4 week ) Brachytherapy : . History Physical ii . IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires iii . Serum PSA - Post 12 month follow-up patient follow additional two year : ( Note : In year 2 3 , patient follow semiannual basis follow assessment perform ) : . History Physical ii . IPSS , SHIM , EPIC questionnaires iii . Serum PSA Version 4 : 07/11/2006 9 Data Collected : The data collect trial result and/or finding procedure assessment previously outline . R Results/findings abstract source document ( e.g . physician note , nursing note , radiology report , lab report , etc… ) record onto study specific case report form . Only medical record validate provider use source document data collection . The data manager assign trial responsible data collection . He/She access patient medical record record medical information medical record onto case report form . The principal investigator review data monthly basis accuracy . Research Interventions : RADIATION THERAPY AND RESEARCH INTERVENTIONS The patient population offer protocol currently offer brachytherapy standard treatment institution . Patients experience change procedure approximately 10 % increase duration fluoroscopy 'on ' time procedure . There also one additional CT scan post-implant assess dosimetry Day ~30 . This necessary account effect post-implant edema dosimetric parameter source position measurement . Implant Volumes : The target volume definition , part , base upon ICRU Report 58 , Dose Volume Specification Reporting Interstitial Therapy . Clinical Target Volume , CTV : Pre-implant TRUS definition prostate Planning Target Volume , PTV : An enlargement CTV follow : 1 . Expand TRUS definition prostate 3 mm lateral dimension TRUS axial image . Thus , lateral dimension prostate increase approximately 6 mm . 2 . Expand TRUS definition prostate 3 mm anterior dimension TRUS axial image . 3 . Maintain posterior border prostate define TRUS . 4 . Project expand cephalad axial definition plane 3 mm cephalad cephalad TRUS plane . 5 . Project expand caudad axial definition plane 3 mm caudad caudad TRUS plane . The PTV approximately 6 mm longer caudad-cephalad dimension CTV . Evaluation Target Volume , ETV . The ETV define post-implant CT definition prostate .</detailed_description>
