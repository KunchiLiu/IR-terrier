	<brief_summary>The purpose study find new investigational hepatitis B virus vaccine , HEPLISAV™ , safe patient least 40 year age progressive loss kidney function advance stage 3 ( GFR ≤ 45 mL/min ) stage 4 chronic kidney disease , expect eventually go hemodialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety HEPLISAV™ Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine End-stage Kidney Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) major global health problem . Worldwide , estimate 2 billion people infect previously 350 million chronically infect . About 25 % people initially clear infection later develop chronic active hepatitis . Hemodialysis pre-dialysis patient kidney failure multiple immune defect make likely develop chronic infection . In addition , hemodialysis increase risk exposure HBV . Existing HBV vaccine effective prevent infection healthy adult . However , poor response occur people 40 year age end-stage kidney failure . This study evaluate safety , tolerability immune response three escalate dose level HEPLISAV™ , compare commercially available HBV vaccine , Engerix-B® , patient least 40 year age progressive loss kidney function advance stage 3 ( GFR ≤ 45 mL/min ) stage 4 chronic kidney disease expect eventually go hemodialysis . About 72 patient include study . Once patient consent , screen , randomize treatment , receive four injection 24-week period , follow-up visit 28 50 week . Safety tolerability evaluate occurrence adverse event , periodic laboratory test , vital sign , local/systemic reactogenicity . Comparison : Patients receive treatment one three escalate dose level HEPLISAV™ comparator vaccine , Engerix-B® .</detailed_description>
