	<brief_summary>This study explore optimum training schedule stroke patient learn motor skill . It see motor train effective training session distribute time ( spaced training ) session schedule close together ( massed training ) . The result study may help researcher devise best training schedule patient derive maximum benefit rehabilitation therapy . Healthy normal volunteer people stroke may eligible study . Patients must 3 month post-stroke . All participant must right-handed 18 80 year age . Participants practice pinch motor task receive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Hand muscle activity measure use surface electromyography ( EMG ) . Pinch train involves train participant pinch strongly possible , use device record force . For TMS , wire coil hold subject scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The subject hears click may feel pull sensation skin coil . There may twitch muscle face , arm leg . For surface EMG , electrode ( small metal disk ) fill conductive gel tap skin muscle . Following one practice session pinch task training TMS , participant four training session , schedule 24 hour , 2 week , 1 month 3 month practice session . For 4- 5-hour practice session , subject follow : - Perform single session pinch motor task familiarization - Undergo TMS measure brain activity - Practice five 6-minute block pinch motor task rest period session perform calculation task ( addition subtraction task ) rest period - Receive TMS 15 minute . ( Some session may sham TMS . ) - Read book magazine 45-minute rest period - Perform single block pinch motor task - Undergo TMS measure brain activity - Complete questionnaire measure attention , fatigue mood For remain four session , participant perform one practice block TMS . Each session last 2 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In cognitive psychology , practice effective training session distribute time ( space ) , rather close ( mass ) . This phenomenon , think engage long-term potentiation-like mechanism animal model describe space effect , investigate motor domain . It know spaced motor train elicits longer last learn effect mass motor training . Objective Study Population : The purpose investigation ass relevance space effect motor skill learn healthy volunteer patient chronic stroke . Design : Experiment 1 : Determination long term learn healthy volunteer space massed practice : The first hypothesis space practice enhance long-lasting learning motor task ( defined performance improvement measure 1 3 month post train ) large extent mass practice separate group healthy volunteer . Healthy volunteer practice well-characterized pinch force task follow space massed schedule factorial design ( n=26 ) . If hypothesis proven correct , proceed suggest PIRC , Experiments 2 3 , gain information mechanism underlie superior training strategy healthy volunteer ( Exp 2 ) determine training strategy also superior mass practice stroke patient ( Exp 3 ) , issue crucial importance neurorehabilitation . Experiment 2 : Study mechanism underlie superior effect space massed practice healthy volunteer , rTMS : Previous work demonstrate involvement primary motor cortex ( M1 ) consolidation motor learn importance top-down attentional control prefrontal cortex . It possible enhanced recruitment two region mediates superior performance level reach spaced training . Here , plan study effect inhibitory 1 Hz TMS apply M1 PFC performance improvement space training . We hypothesize superiority space practice , relative mass practice , cancel regulation activity M1 PFC sham posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) stimulation ( n=104 ) . Experiment 3 : Determination long term learn stroke patient space massed practice : We hypothesize motor learn chronic stroke patient improve large extent space massed practice ( n=42 ) . This study expect delineate role space effect human motor learn identify two possible neural cortical substrate healthy volunteer possible beneficial effect motor learn stroke . Experiment 4 : Determination whether original finding space effect explicit motor learn generalized implicit/procedural motor learning : The ability generalize implicit motor learn important implicit learn ( also know procedural learning ) , define learning occurs without awareness without intention , underlies development automaticity characterize well-learned motor skill ( Reber , 1993 ; Squire , 2004 ) . Hence , purpose stroke rehabilitation , important determine space effect occur implicit ( procedural ) learn underlies development automaticity characterize well-learned motor skill . In addition , use explicit motor sequence task , difficult determine space effect help general motor skill sequence-specific skill . In word , performance benefit space effect derive improvement visuomotor transformation require push key board independently presence absence sequence , motor sequence improvement . Both issue address use serial reaction time task ( SRTT ) , well-studied implicit motor sequence learn task describe detail protocol ( Nissen Bullemer , 1984 ) . We hypothesize space effect occur sequence-specific manner implicit motor sequence learn . We hypothesize SMA-based motor network underlies superiority space effect implicit motor sequence learn . We show use 1Hz TMS create virtual lesion establish cause-effect link SMA ( M1 CZ sham ) superior motor skill Spaced Massed training ( n=80 ) . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure improvement pinch force . Secondary outcome measurement measure motor cortical excitability include motor evoke potential amplitude , intracortical inhibition facilitation . For procedural/implicit motor sequence learning , primary outcome measure improvement skill see difference reaction time sequence randomly order trial .</detailed_description>
