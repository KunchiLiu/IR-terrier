	<brief_summary>Octagam solvent/detergent-treated human normal immunoglobulin ( IGIV ) solution intravenous administration . Octagam 5 % currently register 80 country . This study evaluate efficacy safety Octagam 10 % Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( ITP ) adult . As Octagam 10 % essentially similar Octagam 5 % , expect Octagam 10 % efficacious safe ( respect viral safety ) Octagam 5 % .</brief_summary>
