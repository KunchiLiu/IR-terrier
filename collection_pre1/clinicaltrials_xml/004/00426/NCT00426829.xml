	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate safety treatment patient technically medically inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma proton therapy concurrent bevacizumab biotherapy . 2 . To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) use combination . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate local control rate within radiation field , hepatic control rate outside treatment field , time radiographic progression 2 year survival rate . 2 . To analyze dose-volume characteristic influence development radiation induce liver disease ( RILD ) GI bleeds may occur . 3 . To assess quality life chemoradiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Proton beam design deliver high dose radiation abnormal tissue spar surround normal tissue . Bevacizumab biotherapy design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen ( stomach area ) pelvis . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . You radiation treatment planning session call simulation . You get CT scan abdomen , mark place skin help guide radiation treatment return actual treatment . At around time , receive first dose bevacizumab needle vein . The infusion first last 90 minute . If allergic reaction , fever , chill , infusion shorten 60 minute 30 minute later infusion . Your second dose bevacizumab give start radiation therapy treatment . Your final dose bevacizumab give 2 week later . You receive radiation therapy day , 5 day row ( Monday-Friday ) 4 week ( total 20 treatment ) . During study , physical exam weekly treatment , 1 month last proton beam therapy visit every 3 month thereafter . Every week , receive proton beam therapy , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check side effect . You ask side effect may experience . You may remain study long benefitting . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . After participation study , follow-up evaluation every 3 month 2 year . During visit , physical exam . You CT scan . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic colon cancer . The use bevacizumab proton beam therapy investigational . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytologic histologic proof primary liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma ) . Patients nonmetastatic , unresectable disease eligible . Patients positive margin surgical resection eligible . Metastasis define unequivocal evidence extrahepatic disease base CT imaging , exclude nodal disease . Tumors must great 10cm ( small satellite lesion around large lesion allow ) , encompass radiation treatment field ( assessed radiation oncologist ) . Prior chemotherapy , transarterial chemoembolization radiofrequency ablation permit . A minimum four week must elapse prior treatment plan protocol therapy . Prior liver resection permit long interval surgery enrollment least 4 week . Karnofsky performance status &gt; /= 70 eligible . There age restriction . Absolute granulocyte count &gt; /= 1,500 cells/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; /= 8 gm/dL platelet count &gt; /= 80,000 cells/mm3 . Serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5 mg/dl . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; /= 3 time upper limit normal . Serum bilirubin &lt; /= 5mg/dL prior start therapy . A signed studyspecific consent form , attach protocol . ChildPugh class C cirrhosis . Gross ascites see CT precludes accurate target tumor radiation therapy Proteinuria screening demonstrate either Urine protein : creatinine ( UPC ) ratio &gt; 1.0 screening OR Urine dipstick proteinuria &gt; 2+ ( patient discover &gt; 2+ proteinuria dipstick urinalysis baseline undergo 24 hour urine collection must demonstrate &lt; 1g protein 24 hour eligible ) . Patients currently receive anticoagulation treatment coumadin , low molecular weight heparin IV heparin . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Anticoagulation line maintenance permit . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 0 , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study ; fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 7 day prior Day 0 . Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( e.g. , uncontrolled hypertension [ blood pressure &gt; 150/100 mmHg medication ] , history myocardial infarction within 6 month , unstable angina ) , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great congestive heart failure , unstable symptomatic arrhythmia require medication ( subject chronic atrial arrhythmia , i.e. , atrial fibrillation paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia eligible ) , Class II great peripheral vascular disease . History aneurysm , stroke , transient ischemic attack , arteriovenous malformation within 6 month . Prior unanticipated severe reaction bevacizumab . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior Day 0 Patients organ allograft . Pregnant woman exclude study ; woman childbearing potential must agree practice adequate contraception ( oral , injectable , implantable hormonal contraceptive ; tubal ligation ; intrauterine device ; barrier contraceptive spermicide ; vasectomized partner ) refrain breast feeding , specify informed consent . Women childbearing potential defined woman surgical sterilization menopausal 12 consecutive month . Male patient must agree father child must agree use condom . Prior radiation therapy upper abdominal low thoracic field could overlap propose treatment field . Serious concomitant medical psychiatric disorder place patient high risk noncompliance morbidity due protocol therapy . Patients history hypertension must wellcontrolled ( &lt; /= 140/90 mmHg stable regimen antihypertensive therapy )</criteria>
