	<brief_title>Secondary Debulking Surgery +/- Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Stage III Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Ovarian cancer second common gynaecologic cancer Netherlands precede endometrial cancer . It however lead cause death among woman gynaecologic malignancy annual mortality rate 9 per 100.000 . The majority patient diagnose high stage ovarian carcinoma due fact symptom occur late stage disease screen method ovarian cancer suboptimal . Optimal treatment consist combination chemotherapy debulking surgery . Despite appearance localize disease absence obvious residual tumour follow primary treatment , majority patient ( 80 % ) persistent disease develop recurrent disease . Additional strategy warrant reduce recurrence rate increase disease free survival overall survival group patient . The concept administer intraperitoneal chemotherapy base idea peritoneal dialysis . Intraperitoneal drug therapy design maximize drug delivery tumour generally acceptable systemic side effect associate IV administration drug . This strategy especially attractive treatment ovarian carcinoma , remain largely restrict abdominal cavity natural history . So far 3 randomise control trial show overall progression-free survival benefit cisplatin administer postoperatively IP route patient stage III , optimally resected disease . These study however find majority patient complete plan 6 cycle due catheter relate problem . An alternative way administer chemotherapy intra abdominally whilst bypassing use catheter intra- abdominally provide perfusion abdomen surgery hyperthermic condition . This study compare interval debulking plus minus perfusion abdomen chemotherapy hyperthermic condition surgery ( OVHIPEC ) . Objective : The primary objective study compare duration recurrence free survival follow completion treatment 2 study arm . Secondary objective study involve toxicity morbidity , quality life , tumour response follow treatment overall survival study arm compare standard arm . Study design : Phase III randomise trial Study population : Patients diagnose stage III ovarian carcinoma , peritoneal cell carcinoma tuba carcinoma eligible interval debulking surgery either follow primary chemotherapy follow incomplete primary debulking chemotherapy . Age 18 - 76 yr old . Intervention : One group undergo interval debulking hyperthermic perfusion abdominal cavity cisplatin 100 mg/m2 end surgery . The group treat interval debulking . Main study parameters/endpoints : Recurrence free survival Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Participants study ask fill quality life questionnaire ( 12 time 2 year ) . Blood sample take follow write informed consent treatment , surgery follow-up visit marker study proteomics study ( 10 time 2 year ) . For patient participate pharmacokinetic study ( 20 ) 2 tissue sample take abdominal cavity surgery blood sample take 6 time surgery . During follow-up 3 monthly visit schedule first 2 year 6-monthly visit year 3-5 . During follow-up visit routine physical exam include pelvic exam vaginal ultrasound ( optional ) perform . CT-scans perform first 2 year randomisation 4 time follow-up . Risks participate trial related abdominal perfusion cisplatin . This cause systemic effect : nephrotoxicity , bone marrow toxicity , neurotoxicity , long hospital stay . It also increase chance bowel perforation bowel anastomose result longer hospital stay possibly surgical intervention . To prevent systemic side effect intra-abdominally administer cisplatin , sodium thiosulphate administer intravenously surgery .</detailed_description>
