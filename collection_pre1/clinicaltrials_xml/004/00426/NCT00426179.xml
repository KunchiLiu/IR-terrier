	<criteria>Healthy male nonsmoking subject age 1855 year , history seasonal allergic rhinitis consistent Timothy grass pollen allergy . They must show : positive skin prick test Timothy grass pollen ( wheal difference Timothy grass pollen negative control ≥ 3 mm ) within 12 month precede screen visit demonstrate symptomatic worsening ( TNSS ≥4 ) within one hour nasal allergen challenge Be otherwise healthy health problem may jeopardize subject participate study , absence history significant allergy . Subjects partner must agree use effective contraceptive measure screen end study visit . Respiratory disease history mild stable asthma require treatment associate normal lung function . Structural nasal abnormality nasal polyps examination , history frequent nose bleeding , recent nasal surgery recent ( within 8 week prior baseline visit ) recent ( four week ) ongoing upper low respiratory tract infection . Use medication would affect response allergen challenge ( e.g . corticosteroid , decongestant , antihistamine , medication antiinflammatory effect ) nasally apply medication within 14 day prior allergen challenge ( 30 day systemic antiinflammatory therapy include oral corticosteroid ) , know influence Imatinib bioavailability clearance History laboratory evidence acute chronic renal insufficiency abnormal liver function . Subjects may voluntarily withdraw withdrawn study discretion investigator sponsor time . Subjects may withdraw study prematurely one follow reason : Subject withdraw consent Upper respiratory tract infection Presence allergic rhinitis symptom screen period prior prewash Day 1 A past medical history inherit heart disease , valve defect , cardiomyopathy , rheumatic fever , arrhythmia , cardiac intervention clinically significant ECG abnormality . Adverse event nontolerable symptom result allergen challenge Administration concomitant medication ( randomize receive Fluticasone propionate ) would impact study result ( e.g . corticosteroid ) , include subject require asthma therapy ( inhaled systemic ) . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
