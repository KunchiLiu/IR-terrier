	<brief_title>Microbial Surveillance Children Hospitalized Cardiovascular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Guidelines antimicrobial prophylaxis cardiac surgery advise use first generation cephalosporin child come home . Large number child pass cardiac surgery Hadassah University Hospital , Jerusalem , hospitalize several day operation Pediatric Surgery department due administrative reason . These child receive broad spectrum antibiotic , vancomycin ceftazidime , peri-operative prophylaxis , order prevent infection hospital acquire flora could become colonized period . This policy cause exposure broad spectrum antibiotic begin child , also provide antimicrobial pressure intensive care unit , influence development resistant flora . There documentation child acquire resistant flora hospitalization pre-operative period . We suggest check microbial flora child hospitalize cardiac surgery , order determine need broad spectrum antimicrobial prophylaxis . Goals To check microbial flora child hospitalize cardiac surgery different time point : admission hospitalization Pediatric Surgery Department , admission PICU ( immediately operation ) , 3 - 5 day , drain extract . To document change resistance pattern microbial pathogen period To determine optimal regimen antimicrobial prophylaxis child need hospitalize department operation Methods Surveillance culture would take child hospitalize cardiac surgery several time point : 1. admission Pediatric Surgery department pre-operatively 2. weekly afterwards , continue hospitalize without surgery 3. admission PICU surgery 4. subsequent hospitalization PICU 3 - 5 day 5. day drain extraction These culture include culture nostril , throat , axilla , perineum rectum post operative wound .</detailed_description>
