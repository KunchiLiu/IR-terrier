Signed write informed consent . Prior ADT ( great 3 month ) . History treatment calcitriol bisphosphonates . Suppressive dos thyroxine within previous year . Concomitant prior history longterm treatment ( great equal 3 month ) systemic glucocorticoid . Evidence follow condition per subject selfreport chart review : Current hyper hypothyroidism ( stable thyroid replacement therapy allow , TSH within normal reference range ) . Paget 's disease , Cushing 's disease , hyperprolactinemia , chronic liver disease . Unstable systemic disease include active infection , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month randomization .
