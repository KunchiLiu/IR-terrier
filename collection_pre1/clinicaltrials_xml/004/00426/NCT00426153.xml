	<detailed_description>The primary aim study compare effect Octreotide LAR® Depot liver volume patient severe polycystic liver disease candidate decline surgical treatment liver cyst fenestration , liver resection liver transplantation compare placebo . The secondary aim study : ( 1 ) Assess effect Octreotide LAR® Depot total kidney volume iothalamate clearance patient polycystic kidney disease associate severe polycystic liver disease candidate decline surgical treatment liver cyst fenestration , liver resection liver transplantation . ( 2 ) Evaluate quality life change associate administration Octreotide LAR® Depot patient . ( 3 ) Assess toxicity Octreotide LAR® Depot patient polycystic liver disease ( PLD ) . Note : Subjects complete 1 year randomize trial offer enrollment open-label ( subject receive Octreotide ) extension trial additional two year treatment .</detailed_description>
