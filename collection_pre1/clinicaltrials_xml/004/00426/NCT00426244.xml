	<brief_title>Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine Pregnancy : Physiologic Clinical Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The osteopathic philosophy health build model basic body function coordinate integrated musculoskeletal system . Osteopathic medical student taught consider aspect assess , diagnose , treat individual patient . As treatment method reflect osteopathic philosophy , osteopathic manipulative medicine ( OMM ) body-based modality patient evaluate treated whole improve physiologic function remove impediment optimal health functioning . During pregnancy , woman 's body challenge significant extensive physiological biomechanical change . Some physiological change , increase fluid volume sympathetic tone , may lead consequence edema , preterm labor , meconium-staining amniotic fluid . The biomechanical state woman 's body also drastically affect ; fetus grows uterus expands , center gravity shift forward , rotate pelvis anteriorly increase lordosis low back , may also affect motion hip legs . These postural change also consequence low back pain , decrease functional status , alter gait . Both physiologic biomechanical consequence significant long-term impact health mother child . OMM theorize facilitate body 's adjustment physiological biomechanical demand pregnancy improve outcome pregnancy , labor delivery . Clinical case study report reduce back pain , short labor , few incidence peripartum complication patient receive prenatal OMM . However , date find publish systematic investigation efficacy OMM manage adverse effect pregnancy woman 's musculoskeletal system , find publish systematic study prove mechanisms action OMM managing pain , edema , gait pregnant patient . Thus , overall question guide proposal : extent physiological mechanism Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine ( OMM ) affect select condition related pregnancy , labor delivery ? Based principle theory OMM limit previous study , hypothesis study OMM improve clinical outcome include low back pain , functional status , incidence meconium-stained amniotic fluid , complication labor delivery , physiological change relate improved autonomic regulation , peripheral hemodynamic regulation , biomechanical change relate gait , part , responsible clinical benefit .</detailed_description>
