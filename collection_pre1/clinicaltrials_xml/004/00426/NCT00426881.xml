	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To ascertain whether 12-month , twice-weekly once-weekly resistance training ( RT ) program significantly improve executive function community-dwelling woman age 65 75 year old compare 12-month , twice-weekly stretch relax ( S &amp; R ) program ( shame exercise ) . We assess executive function standard neuropsychological test . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To describe neural mechanism underpin observe change executive function associate 12-month , twice-weekly once-weekly RT training ( use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ) . 2 . To investigate whether RT-induced change executive function independently associate change physiological fall risk profile . 3 . To investigate dose response RT ( resistance training ) bone health measure dual energy x-ray peripheral quantitative compute tomography . 4 . To conduct one-year follow-up formal cessation resistance training program determine persist effect resistance training cognitive performance , cortical plasticity , physiological fall risk , bone health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Research Question : Does resistance training ( RT ) significantly improve cognitive function , specifically executive function old woman Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score equal great 24 ( i.e. , cognitively intact ) compare stretch &amp; relax ( S &amp; R ; control ) program ? Secondary Research Questions : 1 . Are change cortical activation associate RT-induced change executive function ? 2 . Are RT-induced improvement executive function associate lower physiological fall risk ? 3 . Is dose-response bone health RT ( resistance training ) ? RESEARCH PLAN : Study Design : A 12-month , single-blinded , randomize control trial . Participants : 155 cognitively-intact ( i.e. , MMSE score &gt; 24 ) , right-handed , sedentary community-dwelling woman , age 65 75 year . Measurement : Measurements take place baseline , six month , trial completion . Standard neuropsychological test physiological fall risk assessment occur three measurement session . A subset participant ( 20 experimental group ) undergo fMRI assessment baseline trial completion . Exercise Classes : Participants randomize 12-month , twice-weekly once-weekly RT program stretch &amp; relax program ( control ) . All exercise offer Vancouver YMCA partner previously . Sample Size Justification : The sample size 50 per experimental group ( i.e. , N = 155 ) base primary end point study , cognitive performance executive function . SUMMARY : Falls major challenge senior population . To date , intervention significantly reduce fall among cognitive impairment . Our immediate primary goal test whether RT improve cognitive performance executive function ; impaired executive function associate injurious fall . If propose exercise trial prove successful , RT intervention trialed future large study power fall .</detailed_description>
