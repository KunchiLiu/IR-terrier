	<brief_summary>The suggested research aim test effectiveness external mechanical device apply used parturient pain relieve labour . The research perform control closely observed way , ensure safety involve parturient newborn .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Efficiency Device Meant Relieve Labour Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical Trial Design A prospective control study mean scientifically test feasibility device alleviate labour pain . - Every woman sign inform consent form . - Guidance proper safe use device give specially trained midwife . - The study perform Laniado Hospital-Sanz Medical Center , Netanya , Israel . - The study group consist 60 woman , 30 group . - Eligibility : Ages Eligible study 18 year . Participants : - The study group shall consist 30 parturients active labour , contraction , demand receive analgesia . The device give , guidance pre-trained midwife professional supervision . This study group include also woman choose continue use till application epidural analgesia . - The control group shall consist 30 parturients active labour , contraction , choose receive epidural analgesia . Inclusion criterion : - Women low-risk normal pregnancy . - Healthy woman , age 18 year . - Single pregnancy - At active labour , contraction labour pain . Exclusion criterion : - Women high risk pregnancy ( Diabetes Mellitus , Arterial Hypertension , multiple fetal pregnancy , abnormal amniotic fluid index , Intra Uterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , situation might imply placental insufficiency ) - Caesarean section past - Any contraindication vaginal delivery ( breech presentation Placenta Previa ) . - Any active illness , abnormal body temperature , Fatigue , etc . - Women complain pain nonrelated labour . Criteria take study : Upon parturient 's demand . Analgesia give upon parturient demand . Method : Parturients arrive delivery room fit criterion randomly divide two group : study group , use device , control group . Intensity pain measure five different stage : 1 . Before put device . 2 . Five minute start use device . 3 . After 30 minute use . 4 . The device turn duration three consecutive contraction pain intensity measure . 5 . The device turn pain intensity measure 5 minute renew use . - Pain intensity measure define participant use Mosby Pain Rating Scale ( see attach document ) . - The device attach participant uterine contraction frequency least 3 contraction every 10 minute cervical dilatation least 2 cm . - Both group divide accord 3 age subgroup : 18 30 , 31 40 , 41 45 . - A division accord BMI : BMI 20 , 20 25 , BMI 25 . In group 6 index measure : 1 . Comparison pain intensity subject group . 2 . Stage application analgesia , epidural . 3 . Length second stage birth . 4 . Rate instrumental delivery . 5 . Rate Caesarean Sections due non-advancement progressive labour , arrest cervical dilatation , arrest fetal head descent . Rate fetal non reassure monitor , like fetal deceleration low variability . Study length : The study may take around one year , till enough case collect group . Definition success : Success define proof labour pain relief achievement , measure difference study control group , among participant study group , accord statistical criterion customary similar study . Exceptional success consider statistical proof could observe use device shortens delivery length time , , use device diminishes usage epidural analgesia .</detailed_description>
