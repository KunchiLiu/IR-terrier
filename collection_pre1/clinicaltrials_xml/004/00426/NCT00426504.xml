	<brief_summary>Historically , patient stage III IV head neck cancer treat surgery and/or radiation therapy . Based result recent clinical trial , patient able undergo surgery , chemotherapy radiation therapy adopt current standard care . The chemo-radiation approach , however , entail significant increase treatment-related toxicity , limit extent treatment offer patient . In trial , ability new form radiation therapy delivery call IMRT evaluate ability reduce amount radiation-induced toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Using Helical Tomotherapy IMRT Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanisms action explain radiation-induced toxic effect result aggressive radiation therapy treatment head neck cancer include additive synergistic increase mucositis combination chemotherapy radiotherapy . The severe toxicity associate aggressive radiation therapy treatment locoregional head neck cancer limit extent treatment offer since many patient present nutritional deficiency consequent general debility . Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) technology potential exquisite dose paint structure manner permit exclusion normal tissue sensitive structure high dose radiation volume without compromise primary tumor nodal target coverage . In phase I/II feasibility trial , radical radiotherapy deliver use Helical Tomotherapy Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( HT-IMRT ) dose 66-70 Gy involve area least 50 Gy un-involved site , treat prophylactically . It hypothesize pattern failure toxicity profile patient treated helical tomotherapy demonstrate great efficacy helical tomotherapy , compare conventional radiotherapy , treatment cancer head neck .</detailed_description>
