	<brief_summary>This study use transplantation treat patient problem immune system . The immune system cell come bone marrow grow special cell call stem cell . Giving patient stem cell someone else may help cure many patient certain immune disease . This call 'bone marrow transplantation ' . This procedure side effect life-threatening . To try make transplantation safer use low dos medication use prepare patient transplant . 'Conditioning ' treatment give patient create space bone marrow . This let cell donor go bone marrow produce normal immune cell . This study use low dos drug call busulfan lower dose radiation currently use kind bone marrow transplantation disease . Another problem occur bone marrow transplantation 'graft-versus-host disease ' . This happen cell donor attack different part patient body . This study use medicine call sirolimus instead usual medicine , cyclosporine , prevent graft-versus-host disease . To go onto study , must : 1 . A severe immune deficiency , chronic granulomatous disease leukocyte adhesion deficiency . 2 . Have problem disease call stem cell transplantation . 3 . You must also age 3 65 year . Two group patient include study : 1 . Patients brother sister stem cell match patient . This know allogeneic match sibling transplant . 2 . Patients match sibling donor donor match National Marrow Donor Program . This know match unrelated donor transplantation . Patients follow procedure : - To create space bone marrow , patient give two drug , Campath-1H busulfan . To prevent body get rid donate cell , patient give sirolimus . On day BMT , patient match unrelated donor group also receive low-dose whole-body radiation . This improve chance patient body accept donor cell . - Patients get donor stem cell intravenous ( IV ) line go vein body . The cell make way bone marrow space slowly refill marrow next several week . Patients usually stay hospital 30 day transplant . - For first 3 month transplant , patient watch closely . The patient frequent visit clinic . During visit patient physical examination blood test . The doctor nurse also check symptom patient may . At day 100 transplant sample bone marrow take . - Patients continue follow periodically least 5 year transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Stem Cell Transplantation Congenital Immunodeficiencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital immunodeficiency - include chronic granulomatous disease , leukocyte adhesion deficiency others - comprise group disorder immune system fail develop normally due genetic defect . As result , affect patient suffer recurrent infection significantly shorten life expectancy . The current management patient limit close surveillance infection , administration prophylactic antimicrobial , rapid aggressive treatment suspect documented infection broad-spectrum antibiotic . Although often effective , treatment require long hospitalization , impact overall quality life significantly , lead significant morbidity , renal failure deafness . Currently , available cure disorder bone marrow transplantation , commonly use HLA-matched related sibling donor ( Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation ) . However , 30 % patient general population HLA- match related sibling , allogeneic related transplantation often option , result need match unrelated donor transplantation . The National Marrow Donor Program serve national registry volunteer willing donate progenitor cell eligible recipient well repository cord blood product . Despite continued improvement use transplantation schema include development nonmyeloablative regimen remain significant morbidity mortality associate transplantation , particular , graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) . GvHD result graft recognize host antigen foreign , typically presence inflammation , result type iatrogenic autoimmune disease . For patient non-malignant disease , aim transplant solely replace defective deficient cell population . Furthermore , graft versus tumor effect require , regimen design establish tolerance induction and/or stable mixed chimerism may preferable cure patient population ; therefore , alternate transplant strategy use suppress development GvHD effect . To reduce morbidity mortality associate transplantation , propose use combination uniquely design conditioning regimen achieve adequate engraftment congenitally immunodeficient patient subset patient autoinflammatory/immunodysregulatory condition , use either alloPBSC transplantation patient HLA-matched related sibling donor , MUD transplantation without appropriate HLA-matched related sibling donor . For alloPBSC transplantation ( Group 1 ) , propose use novel busulfan-based , nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen combine Campath-1-H h-ATG , immunosuppressive monoclonal antibody , sirolimus , tolerance inducing immunosuppressant use GvHD prophylaxis . For MUD transplantation ( Group 2 ) , also use similar conditioning regimen , modification ( due increase risk graft rejection HLA-matched unrelated cell ) perform match unrelated cord blood transplantation patient immunodeficiency . Given novelty , combination test pilot trial compare historical control .</detailed_description>
