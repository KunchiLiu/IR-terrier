	<brief_summary>Our research aim improve use medicine know prevent recurrent heart attack . In particular , know statin treatment useful heart attack , many patient use . There possible reason . Patients find affordable medicine . Their doctor may prescribe medicine leave hospital . Some people may culturally mistrust use medicine . So may decide take even prescribe . We develop hospital base culturally attuned program target problem . In program , community health worker counsel help patient access pharmacy assistance program . We test whether program improve appropriate statin use . We enroll patient heart attack . We compare patient counsel community health worker get usual care baseline 6 12 month ( participant enrol early phase recruitment additional study visit 24 month ) . We test `` bad '' cholesterol level control . We find regularly fill questionnaire take medicine . Finally , test get benefit statin treatment . We use blood test image patient ' artery ultrasound . We also measure cost-effective hospital run program . It goal develop community health worker model culturally sensitive people cultural , educational educational barrier . Statin use know benefit patient theory ; culturally competent program improve health outcome practice . After test , cost-effective program implement hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The lipid-specific pleiotropic benefit statin therapy , secondary prevention coronary artery disease ( CAD ) mortality demonstrate . Statin therapy particular underutilized white Black American population CAD access therapy afford . Systems factor related finding involve lack continuous access medication follow hospital discharge many Black Americans white Americans ability readily afford medicine educational background understand importance therapy . In many case , failure primary care physician continue statin therapy discharge patient poor access therapy comply pharmacotherapy . Patient factor include mistrust volitional nonadherence relate beliefs personal priority , lack education support relate preventive therapy . This trial thus take place lower income lower educational level Black white American patient identified time hospitalization continue two year myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass graft , percutaneous intervention . The overall hypothesis quality care intervention deliver Black white American patient low income /or education culturally competent community health worker ( CHW ) within exist hospital system result improve outcome . The CHW counsel patient help access resource , include Maryland private pharmacy assistance program . The specific aim compare impact hospital-based CHW intervention versus usual care ( UC ) ( 1 ) percent achieve LDL cholesterol goal , ( 2 ) adherence statin regimen , ( 3 ) health outcome include inflammatory marker vascular function 6 12 month hospitalization premature CAD event . ( Participants enrol early phase recruitment additional study visit 24 month . ) We determine cost achieve LDL-C goal group . Outcome measure include patient adherence ( pill count , modify Hill-Bone questionnaire ) , lipid parameter , hs-CRP , brachial artery reactivity marker endothelial function . Intention treat analysis use . Multivariable adjusted analysis use generalize linear model generalize estimate equation use determine independent effect intervention adjust covariates . A sample size 68 subject per group detect hypothesize difference proportion participant meet goal level LDL-C 92 % power , primary outcome 1 year . This proposal demonstrate effectiveness potentially generalizable model culturally competent care improve use statin therapy health outcome Black white Americans document CAD poor access statin pharmacotherapy .</detailed_description>
