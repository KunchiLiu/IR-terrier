	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether addition vaccine participant reduce intensity transplant safe beneficial . The vaccine use trial , call GVAX , make participant leukemia cell , give 1-4 month transplant . In recent year , researcher discover GVAX vaccine make patient 's cancer call engineer laboratory produce protein call GM-CSF , effective stimulating powerful immune response specific cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GM-CSF Vaccinations After Allogeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With Advanced Myeloid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This trial divide three phase : 1 ) Pre-transplant phase ; 2 ) Reduced intensity transplant phase ; 3 ) Vaccination phase . - Pre-transplant phase : Once suitable donor identify , participant undergo battery standard pre-transplant test procedure collect leukemia cell vaccine generation . Blood test , heart function test , pulmonary function test , tuberculosis test , bone marrow aspirate biopsy , leukemia cell collection leukapheresis . - Allogeneic reduce intensity stem cell transplant phase : The transplant phase study begin participant admit hospital receive chemotherapy stem cell transplant . The minimum duration hospitalization procedure approximately 8 day . In week participant receive stem cell , treat chemotherapy central line . The goal chemotherapy control cancer suppress immune system body reject donor stem cell . - Just prior immediately follow infusion stem cell , participant receive medication help prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , common complication transplant donor 's immune cell attack body . After transplant , participant also take antibiotic medication help prevent possible infection . - Sargramostim ( GM-CSF , leukine ) , white blood cell growth factor , give daily subcutaneously start day stem cell transplant blood count recover . - After stem cell infusion , participant examine blood test weekly 1 month . Between 30-45 day transplant , bone marrow biopsy perform assess status disease look evidence donor 's cell bone marrow . - Vaccination Phase : After bone marrow biopsy 30-45 day transplant , participant begin receive vaccination . The vaccine administer subcutaneously intradermally arm , leg , abdomen 6 time period 9 week . The first 3 vaccination occur week 3 consecutive week , last 3 vaccine give every week 6 week . All vaccination may give outpatient clinic . During period time , participant closely monitor weekly basis monitor side effect . Before first fifth sixth vaccination , small amount participant leukemia cell injected skin see immune system react cause redness swell . - About 4 week last vaccination ( 6th ) , bone marrow aspirate biopsy perform assess status disease . - After 1st 5th vaccination , skin biopsy perform assess response vaccine site . These biopsy relatively simple outpatient procedure .</detailed_description>
