	<brief_summary>Cervical dystonia ( CD ) characterize abnormal , involuntary sustain cervical muscle contraction associate twist movement abnormal posture neck quite disable . Currently good oral medication treatment CD . While botulinum toxin injection effective , require repeat injection patient either stop respond never respond . Therefore , good treatment need . While underlie mechanism dystonia entirely know , information suggest ude underactivity chemical compound , GABA , locate basal ganglion . Cannabinoids compound enhance transmission GABA , thus , may alleviate symptom dystonia . Dronabinol , one cannabinoid , widely use treat anorexia nausea chemotherapeutic patient . The aim study , therefore , study effect dronabinol cervical dystonia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Dronabinol Treatment Cervical Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover , phase II study dronabinol versus placebo . Thirty patient idiopathic cervical dystonia enrol study . Patients randomize either dronabinol placebo computer-generated random number table kept central pharmacy end trial . Only central pharmacy aware treatment allocation ; others blind duration trial . Regardless treatment allocation , study participant begin take assign study medication Day 1 , increase `` dose '' ( actual increase dose dronabinol-assigned arm , fictional increase dose placebo-assigned arm ) every 3 day . At end third week , Day 21 , study participant complete first phase study medication remain study medication period two week , plan study visit . On Day 36 , study participant plan study visit , new medication dispense , participant begin take arm study medication period 3 week , manner first arm . At end 3 week ( 8 week total ) , study participant discontinue assign study medication attend plan study visit study termination . At visit , patient assess medical neurological history examination video record make post hoc analysis TWSTRS rater blind treatment arm . The main issue compliance study medication relate side-effects . Side-effects mainly dose related minimize dose escalation protocol , plan study . Compliance adverse effect monitor weekly phone call side effect pill count end treatment arm .</detailed_description>
