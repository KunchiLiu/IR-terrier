	<brief_title>Efficacy Multicentre Trial ImmunoTherapy Vaccination With Abagovomab Treat Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard initial treatment ovarian cancer patient include surgery chemotherapy vast majority case achieve disappearance ovarian cancer lesion . This status , call `` clinical remission '' mean evidence cancer CT scan physical examination need carefully follow order confirm maintenance remission status early detect cancer grow start new chemotherapy . At present , approved therapy exist maintenance treatment patient achieve clinical remission . This trial aim evaluate repeat vaccination Abagovomab create immunoresponse able fight cancer cell thus keep remission status long possible help patient live disease-free longer . Patients achieve remission status chemotherapy screen study participation meet criterion inclusion start receive single subcutaneous injection every 2 week ( first 4 dos - induction phase ) every 4 week ( maintenance phase ) . The duration treatment approximately 4 year stop case relapse occur . In order evaluate real benefit vaccination , experimental treatment include Abagovomab ( active drug ) placebo ( vehicle , without drug ) , double chance receive Abagovomab . Assignment Abagovomab placebo do computerised system nobody study know treatment allocate study end . Patients visit every 4 week undergo CT scan pelvis abdomen every 12 week order confirm remission status early detect relapse eventually occur . This do blind condition ( i.e . without aware treatment patient go receive ) first part study expect last four year . After overall status patient continue monitor phone contact additional five year .</detailed_description>
