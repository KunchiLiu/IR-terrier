	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish safety long-term effectiveness coronary stenting ABT 578-eluting balloon expandable stent ( Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN ) vs. sirolimus-eluting balloon expandable stent ( Cordis Johnson &amp; Johnson , Warren , New Jersey ) paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Taxus liberte , Boston Scientific ) treatment coronary stenosis routine clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study document slow-release polymeric sirolimus-eluting stent ( Cypher , Cordis ) paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Taxus , Boston Scientific ) reduce neointimal formation result decrease angiographic restenosis target lesion revascularization 1-3 year multicenter randomized clinical trial RAVEL , SIRIUS , TAXUS I-VI.From study , two lead drug-eluting stent ( DESs ) Cypher Taxus widely rapidly accepted standard treatment coronary lesion . Recently , randomized study conduct reveal different outcome different two DESs . These study show sirolimus-eluting stent well paclitaxel-eluting stent term low angiographic restenosis rate two DESs similar angiographic outcome . A recent meta-analysis support result former randomized study . Patients receive sirolimus-eluting stent significantly low risk restenosis target vessel revascularization compare receive paclitaxel-eluting stent . With recent approval new DES , ABT-578-eluting stent ( Endeavor , Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN ) , comparison study conduct compare Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent sirolimus-eluting stent paclitaxel-eluting stent . ABT-578 sirolimus share common structural biological property . The ENDEAVOR clinical trial currently progress evaluate phosphoryl choline ( PC ) -coated ABT-578-eluting stent prevention restenosis . The Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent utilize cobalt alloy balloon-expandable stent ( Driver ; Medtronic ) geometry similar stainless steel stent use preliminary study ( S7 ; Medtronic ) . The Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent also employee PC strut surface coat drug delivery reservoir dose 10 ug/mm ABT-578 . The Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent , however , differs stent use experimental study addition drug-free PC coat serve diffusion barrier retard drug release polymer reservoir . Angiographic analysis 4 month 100-patient focal de novo lesion ENDEAVOR I feasibility study demonstrate mean in-stent percent diameter stenosis approximately 14 % late lumen loss 0.3 mm low frequency target lesion revascularization ( 1 % ) . The clinical outcome ENDEAVOR II ( 1,500 patient randomize ABT-578 bare metal stent ) ENDEAVOR III ( 436 patient randomize 3:1 ABT-578 Cypher ) trial well ongoing study show efficacy PC-coated ABT-578-eluting stent . In ENDEAVOR III study , Endeavor stent large late loss high binary restenosis analysis segment stented segment . In contrast , TLR rate statistically different Endeavor ( 6.0 % ) Cypher ( 5.3 % , p=1.0 ) stent . This result study raise several question warrant randomized study 1 ) angiographic superiority Cypher stent apply complex lesion , 2 ) TLR rate similar spite significantly different angiographic outcome , 3 ) good Endeavor Taxus stent , etc . The ENDEAVOR IV study conduct compare safety efficacy Endeavor stent versus Taxus stent . However , inclusion ENDEAVOR IV study also limit study include complex lesion . Because limitation current ENDEAVOR series , large randomize study concurrent comparison three DESs treatment real-world practice would need .</detailed_description>

The patient know hypersensitivity contraindication follow medication : â€¢ Heparin , Aspirin , Both Clopidogrel Ticlopidine , Sirolimus , paclitaxel , ABT 578 , Stainless steel and/or Contrast medium ( patient document sensitivity contrast effectively premedicated steroid diphenhydramine [ e.g . rash ] may enrol . Patients true anaphylaxis prior contrast medium , however , enrol ) . Female childbearing potential , unless recent pregnancy test negative , possibly plan become pregnant time enrollment study . Current known current platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hgb &lt; 10 g/dL . An elective surgical procedure plan would necessitate interruption antiplatelet drug first 12 month post enrollment . Noncardiac comorbid condition present life expectancy &lt; 1 year may result protocol noncompliance ( per site investigator 's medical judgment ) . Patients actively participate another drug device investigational study , complete primary endpoint followup period . Patients target lesion instent restenosis stented segment drugeluting stent ( instent restenosis bare metal stent include ) . Patients EF &lt; 30 % . Patients cardiogenic shock Acute STEMI patient within symptom onset &lt; 12 hour need primary angioplasty Creatinine level &gt; 3.0mg/dL dependence dialysis . Severe hepatic dysfunction ( AST ALT &gt; 3 time upper normal reference value ) . Patients leave main stem stenosis ( &gt; 50 % visual estimate )</criteria>
