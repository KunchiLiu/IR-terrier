	<brief_summary>Patients cystic fibrosis ( CF ) need frequently undergo course IV antibiotic therapy . To avoid high number venipuncture peripheral venous catheter ( SPVC ) cannula use . Because irritant action drug use , SPVC 's often last whole antibiotic course ( usually two week ) patient puncture insertion new IV line . With passing time vein difficult find . An alternative use cannula surgical insertion central venous catheter . This intervention may contraindications , specially adolescent , cause unacceptable alteration body image . The aim study find way prolong duration SPVC use CF patient antibiotic course avoid irritation vein phlebitis . Design study : randomize controlled trial . The study see collaboration nurse , physician technician Tuscan CF Centre . The patient participate study randomly assign one two group : one group receive antibiotic prescribe accord maximal dilution suggest pharmaceutical company , receive much high dilution ( i.e . high volume Normal Saline ) , time administration . The assessment regard : level inflammation vein ( special visual scale ) duration SPVC . The hypothesis prove dilute antibiotic high volume Normal Saline possible delay prevent irritation vein onset phlebitis . In case hypothesis confirm study easy , secure , low cost immediately available system available reduce number venipuncture necessary complete course IV antibiotic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) common genetic disease affect , among organ , respiratory tree . The major cause mortality morbidity CF pulmonary infection cause limited number bacteria , particular gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) Burkholderia cepacia complex ( BCC ) cause frequent clinically acute pulmonary infection . Current figure show 57.3 % patient lung infect PA 2.9 % lung infect BCC ( 1 ) . To fight pulmonary exacerbation , patient frequently undergo antibiotic treatment , often give orally aerosol administer intravenously ( IV ) . Some CF Centers also adopt treatment protocol patient chronically infected respiratory pathogen prophylactic IV course antibiotic routinely give every 3 month even absence clinical symptom pulmonary exacerbation ( 2 ) An IV course antibiotic treatment continue least 10 day usually last 2 week ( 3 ) . Completing would therefore require numerous venipuncture patient . In USA , 2004 45 % patient age 18 30 require least 1 IV antibiotic course , 25 % 2 IKV course 15 % 3 course ( 1 ) . This IV treatment regime bring relevant burden pain , anxiety worsen quality life ( 4 ) . In order reduce number venipuncture need antibiotic course , several intravenous indwell device use administer antibiotic infusion . Some venous catheter inserted central vessel . Among , port caths Groshong Broviac type Central catheter , Midline catheter commonly use ( 5-9 ) . They intend last several week year . Their insertion require surgical intervention . Such invasive intervention may sometimes indicate due patient 's clinical condition . Moreover , presence permanent device may influence patient ' body image autonomy , negative consequence psychological condition patient , especially adolescence ( 10 ) . Also , systemic infection may occur ( 11 ) , permanent management device may result complicate ( 12-15 ) may influence patient 's day-to-day life . Recently , high incidence thrombosis relate insertion kind catheter describe ( 16 ) The commonly use type IV device administer antibiotic CF short peripheral venous catheter ( SPVC ) cannula ( 17 , 18 ) consider long simple , easy-to-use economic way administer IV therapy CF . The use device allow patient puncture every administration eventually perform antibiotic course home avoid hospitalisation therefore maintain relatively normal daily life . Moreover , compare previously describe permanent device , one less invasive , require surgical intervention insert , intend maintain duration treatment . In order facilitate CF people 's autonomy reduce condition quality life , The home administration IV antibiotic become increasingly common ( 17-21 ) . In 2004 , 20.1 % US CF patient receive home IV treatment ( 1 ) . Patients relatives often trained CF Centers ' Nurses manage administration antibiotic treatment . Typical responsibility CF Center 's Nursing Staff position SPVC , manage venous access drug infusion , evaluate site cannula insertion drug administration , educate patient possible complication ( 21-23 ) . During course , patency venous access one antibiotic administration follow achieve flush catheter end infusion either normal saline heparin solution . With passing time , SPVC insertion might become increasingly difficult due repeat venous trauma , may lead formation thrombus progressive occlusion vein ; ( 17 ) . Due particular respiratory pathogen ( PA , BCC ) affect CF patient ' lung dose antibiotic much high administer non-CF patient pneumonia . Even though sensibly lower risk infectious problem , IV administration high dos antibiotic , may irritate vein ' tunica intima cause phlebitis may occlude vein therefore interrupt vein 's patency . Indeed , well establish infusion antibiotic irritant substance frequently cause iatrogenic phlebitis ( 24-28 ) . Other factor discuss risk factor onset phlebitis short duration SPVC ( 29 ) ; among others , movement patient , his/her age , type SPVC , type dressing use , site insertion ( 30 ) blood count , ( 25 ) . The onset phlebitis oblige healthcare provider reposition venous catheter another site cause patient suffering , pain anxiety . Although scarcely investigate , problem reduce amount venipuncture pain CF patient clinically important . A recent study research group examine recall adult CF patient invasive procedure receive childhood ( 31 ) . The study evidence repeat venipuncture imply additional worsening quality life may influence CF child future compliance treatment . So far study investigate effective way prolong duration SPVCs use without cause phlebitis , substantially inconclusive ( 32,33 ) On basis exist study , hypothesise volume fluid antibiotic dilute , consequently concentration , may affect vein ' tunica intima irritation . Specific Aims Rationale This study aim investigate whether different concentration prescribe dose antibiotic infusate intravenous administration influence inflammation vessel consequent duration SPVCs patient CF undergo antibiotic course . For antibiotic administer IV , producer , besides type infusate , provide also suggest maximum concentration concentration range . Theoretically possible reduce vessel 's irritation keep quantity drug time infusion constant , dilute prescribed amount antibiotic large volume infusate , give interval time . This would lead small number drug molecule act irritant tunica intima . Therefore , aim study verify hypothesis great volume infusate constant amount drug dose time , reduces irritation vessel 's tunica intima cause antibiotic allows longer patency vein longer use SPVC . We compare outcomes two different concentration antibiotic Normal Saline , mostly use infusate IV administration antibiotic . The type prescribe antibiotic time infusion stay . The CF center specialist physician continue prescribe drug usual , accord intern protocols patient ' clinical condition . The eventual purpose study reduce patient ' distress discomfort oblige undergo antibiotic treatment need invasive procedure . Indeed , test hypothesis would confirm , simply increase volume normal saline antibiotic dilute would lead less vein irritation , low incidence phlebitis long permanence SPVC use IV antibiotic course . This would imply reduction number venepunctures need complete IV antibiotic course reduction patient discomfort pain . Also , test hypothesis would confirm , solution propose would immediately applicable clinical practice , since would require authorization process . Also , would little expense completely safe , unless contraindication exist infusion high volume Normal Saline Besides , CF Centers ' Health Care Providers might simple , safe relatively low-cost method prolong duration site IV antibiotic course reduce number venepunctures give patient . Preliminary result Recently group researcher carry observational study , partially retrospective partially prospective ( 34-36 ) . We study 87 SPVCs insert 36 patient 56 IV antibiotic treatment cycle period 6 month ( mean duration 8.3 day ) . It evidence gauge SPVC number daily administration significantly correlate duration site cannula . In particular , SPVCs large gauge ( G22 ) longer mean duration small ( G24 ) SPVCs ( 9.6 day vs. 7.2 day , p=0.03 ) SPVCs use antibiotic course antibiotic daily dose divide 3 administration longer mean duration ( 10.3 day ) use course daily dose divide 2 administration ( 6.5 day , p=0.001 ) . According study , factor patient ' age , brand cannula , health care professional insert cannula , site insertion ( dominate non dominate arm ) , concurrent administration oral anti-inflammatory drug seem influence duration SPVC site . The result study lead researcher hypothesise concentration antibiotic infusion i.e . dilution might impact local inflammation vessel . Indeed , since single administration administer infusion volume 100 ml , patient receive daily antibiotic dose divide 3 administration receive daily antibiotic dose dilute high volume fluid daily administration . The study group compose Nurses , Physician Technician long experience CF research . The group carry also study aim find way cure receive patient least impact possible quality life . In particular study group 's interest focus issue pain CF patient ( 31 , 37 , 38 ) . Experimental Plan Study design : Randomized control non-blinded clinical trial . The study confront effect two different antibiotic concentration administer IV inflammation vein duration situ insert SPVC . The assignment patient one group do randomization . Randomization launch researcher blind regard patient . Data analysis do researcher blind regard patient . The study influence usual course therapeutic treatment choose specialized physician CF center . The experimental variable concentration dose antibiotic prescribed physician infusate , volume fluid need infuse antibiotic . In aim reduce number possible confounding variable , age range patient , SPVC gauge brand , type dressing , scale use evaluation irritation infiltration , type antibiotic use , time infusion , number attempt SPVC insertion standardize .
