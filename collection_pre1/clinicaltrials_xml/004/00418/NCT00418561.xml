	<detailed_description>Test product , dose , mode administration , batch No . : The low dose level evaluate single dose 25 U/kg . The three upper dose level evaluate repeated dos . Patients cohort receive one dose enzyme every week period eight week , total five dos . Dosing performed follow : Cohort 1 : 25 U/kg single dose - hereafter 50 U/kg ; Cohort 2 : 100 U/kg ; Cohort 3 : 200 U/kg . Patients receive low dose single dose receive next dose level repeat dose . After twenty six week subject continue treatment every week safety data available . Safety ( AE/SAE ) monitor every visit period . The dose adjust monthly account change body weight . The infusion length dependent dose . Doses 25 U/kg , 50 U/kg 100 U/kg dilute 50 ml isotonic sodium chloride infuse 30 minute . Infusion 200 U/kg administer manner except infusion time 60 minute . Duration treatment : Half year ( 26 week )</detailed_description>
