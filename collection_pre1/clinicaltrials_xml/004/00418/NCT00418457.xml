	<detailed_description>Surgery primary effective treatment breast cancer , residual disease form scatter micrometastases tumor cell usually unavoidable . Whether minimal residual disease result clinical metastasis function host defense tumor survival growth . At least three perioperative factor shift balance toward progression minimal residual disease : 1 . Surgery per se depress cell-mediated immunity , reduces concentration tumor-related anti-angiogenic factor ( e.g. , angiostatin endostatin ) , increase concentration pro-angiogenic factor VEGF , release growth factor promote local distant growth malignant tissue . 2 . Anesthesia impair numerous immune function , include neutrophil , macrophage , dendritic cell , T-cell , natural killer cell . 3 . Opioid analgesic inhibit cellular humoral immune function human , increase angiogenesis , promote breast tumor growth rodent . However , regional analgesia attenuate prevents adverse effect largely prevent neuroendocrine surgical stress response , eliminate reduce need general anesthesia , minimize opioid requirement . Animal study indicate regional anesthesia optimum postoperative analgesia independently reduce metastatic burden animal inoculate breast adenocarcinoma cell follow surgery . Preliminary data cancer patient also consistent : paravertebral analgesia breast cancer surgery reduce risk recurrence metastasis approximately four-fold ( 95 % CI estimate hazard ratio 0.71 - 0.06 ) 2.5 4-year follow-up period compare opioid analgesia . The investigator thus test hypothesis recurrence breast cancer surgery lower regional anesthesia/analgesia general anesthesia opioid analgesia . In multi-center trial , Stage 1-3 patient mastectomy randomly assign thoracic epidural paravertebral anesthesia/analgesia , general anesthesia opioid analgesia . Enrolling 1,100 patient 5 year provide 85 % power detect 30 % treatment effect alpha 0.05 total four potential stop point . Confirming hypothesis indicate minor modification anesthetic management , one implement little risk cost , reduce risk cancer recurrence — complication often ultimately lethal .</detailed_description>
