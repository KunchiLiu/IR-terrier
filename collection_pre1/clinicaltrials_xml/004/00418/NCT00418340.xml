	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) common condition . At least 20 % population suffer IBS . The symptoms abdominal pain , diarrhoea , constipation , bloat difficulty bowel motion often disable . Many affected young report poor quality life ( QOL ) degree similar gut inflammatory condition like ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease . Yet impact IBS patient ' life often underestimated . This probably unlike inflammatory bowel disease , bowel inflammed bleeds , bowel IBS look normal . Instead problem abnormal functioning gut cause unknown . Currently therapy IBS limit recently therapy focus treat symptom improve QOL primarily underlie mechanism IBS poorly understood . However process implicated IBS e.g . visceral hypersensitivity ( excessive response sensory stimulus within gut ) , infection , immune activation , dysmotility abnormal gut fermentation , potential new therapy look promise . The evidence gut bacteria play role induce IBS symptom due observation improvement IBS symptom probiotic therapy ( bacterial supplement ) antibiotic therapy . Patients IBS hypersensitive colorectal distension compare healthy control . Studies carry unit show visceral pain threshold response stress low patient IBS compare healthy volunteer . This hypersensitivity apparent response physical chemical stimulus trigger visceral hypersensitivity remain largely unknown . Animal model suggest role host immune response intestinal bacteria induction visceral hypersensitivity . This proposal focus exploration mechanism underlie visceral hypersensitivity direct future target therapy . Previous independent study show ( ) bacteria reduce visceral hypersensitivity , ( b ) probiotic therapy alter gut immune response ( c ) gut sensation affect type immune cell gut . Our research proposal investigate relationship gut bacteria , immune system sensory gut nerve order understand IBS symptom generate . This understanding critical effective future drug treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study 1 ) probiotic−induced change visceral hypersensitivity immune activity The effect probiotic therapy assess randomise placebo−controlled study . Subjects recruit prospectively outpatient clinic . A flow chart study show appendix 1 protocol . Patient selection . IBS patient select accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Disease severity determine enrolment validate IBS symptom questionnaire . Questionnaires exclude psychiatric illness : The well−validated Hospital Anxiety Depression Score ( HADS ) questionniaire use identify patient anxiety depression . A SCL−90 questionnaire also use assess psychological profile patient may impact response therapy . Probiotic therapy . Patients randomise receive either VSL # 3 ( 450 billion lyophilize bacteria/sachet ) twice daily 4 week placebo powder contain starch bacteria . VSL # 3 select use study ( ) contain three different Bifidobacteria strain ( addition lactobaccilli streptococci ) limit evidence available Bifidobacteria effective probiotic IBS 10 ; ( b ) induce IL−10 production intestinal DC 27 , pouchitis study , stimulate IL−10 production vivo 38 ; IBS associate deficiency IL−10 production ; ( c ) study one group yield promising result particular probiotic preparation . 1 . Assessing clinical response therapy - Physiological response probiotic therapy : Rectal sensitivity assess baseline day 28 therapy . Rectal sensitivity pressure pain assess Barostat device electrical stimulation respectively . Barostat device use many study measure sensation pressure . Electrical stimulation currently use clinical practice . Equipment test currently use physiology laboratory . - Symptomatic response probiotic therapy : IBS symptom score make baseline d28 therapy . The three symptom IBS assess determine response therapy : abdominal pain/discomfort , bloating/ distension bowel movement , score ordinal scale ( Likert scale ; maximum score 7 ) 100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ; maximum score 100 ) . A composite score sum 3 cardinal symptom also calculate patient ( Likert scale maximum score 21 ) ( VAS ; maximum score 300 ) . - Quality life ( QOL ) probiotic therapy : The SF−36 Heath−related QOL questionnaire , IBS QOL questionnaire administer baseline day 28 . This assess impact IBS symptoms QOL change follow probiotic therapy . Follow−up : Patients contact 6 month reassess symptom score QOL determine longer−term impact therapy . 2 . Assessing Immunological response probiotic therapy . Venepuncture perform collection blood immune cell baseline day 28 . Colonic biopsy collect via flexible sigmoidoscopy entry baseline day 28 follow physiological test . The biopsy use analysis cytokine production limit phenotypic analysis colonic immune cell ( DC ) marker select basis data on−going cross−sectional study look DC IBS compare control . Full analysis blood DC perform time point . Changes DC population cytokine production secondary endpoint study .</detailed_description>
