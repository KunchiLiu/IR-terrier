	<detailed_description>This TROG multicentre feasibility study APBI use 3D CRT select woman node-negative breast cancer treat breast conserve surgery negative margin . This one-arm feasibility study primary endpoint feasibility rate APBI use 3D CRT . This defined proportion eligible patient treat without major protocol deviation . Secondary endpoint include radiation toxicity , cosmetic outcome , quality life , time ipsilateral breast recurrence , disease-free survival , overall survival . Primary objective : To evaluate technical feasibility reproducibility APBI limit region tumour bed use 3D CRT follow breast conserve surgery . Secondary objective : - To assess acute long term toxicity APBI use 3D CRT . - To examine cosmetic outcome woman breast cancer treat breast conserve surgery APBI use 3D CRT . - To determine time ipsilateral breast recurrence , disease free survival overall survival woman node-negative breast cancer completely resect breast conserving surgery follow APBI use 3D CRT . - To assess quality life woman node-negative breast cancer treat breast conserve surgery APBI use 3D CRT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must fulfill follow criterion admission study : Women age &gt; = 50 year . Histologically confirm diagnosis invasive breast carcinoma nonlobular histology . Bilateral mammogram perform within 6 month prior registration . Treated breast conserve surgery ( primary excision reexcision ) negative radial resection margin &gt; = 2 mm* invasive present , associate intraductal tumour . *Patients superficial deep resection margin &lt; 2 mm eligible surgery remove intervene breast tissue subcutaneous tissue pectoralis fascia . Unifocal tumour measure â‰¤ 20 mm maximum microscopic dimension . Negative nodal status determine sentinel node biopsy , axillary dissection , woman &gt; 70 year age , clinical examination . No evidence distant metastasis . Assessed surgeon radiation oncologist suitable breast conserve therapy . Ability tolerate protocol therapy . Protocol therapy must commence later 12 week last surgical procedure 8 week last dose chemotherapy . Availability longterm followup . Women childbearing potential must use adequate contraception RT . Written informed consent . Patients fulfill follow criterion eligible admission study : Multifocal multicentric tumour . Clinical pathologic evidence follow tumour feature : extension chest wall ( exclude pectoralis muscle ) ; oedema ( include peau d'orange ) ulceration skin ; satellite skin nodule confine breast ; inflammatory carcinoma . Presence extensive intraductal component ( ductal carcinoma situ occupy &gt; 25 % primary invasive tumour present adjacent primary tumour ) . Nodepositive breast cancer determine sentinel node biopsy , axillary dissection , woman &gt; 70 year age , clinical examination . Inability localise surgical cavity CT scan evidence surgical cavity , seroma surgical clip delineate tumour bed . Treatment target volume estimate occupy &gt; 25 % ipsilateral whole breast volume . Synchronous metachronous bilateral invasive intraductal breast cancer . Locally recurrent breast cancer . Ipsilateral breast implant . Serious nonmalignant disease precludes definitive surgical radiation treatment ( e.g . scleroderma , systemic lupus erythematosus , cardiovascular/pulmonary/renal disease ) . Previous concomitant malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , invasive carcinoma colon , thyroid , cervix , endometrium treat five year prior study entry . Women pregnant lactating . Psychiatric addictive disorder preclude obtain inform consent adherence protocol</criteria>
