	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Intravenous Oral Steroids Multiple Sclerosis Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous methylprednisolone standard care treat acute MS flare . However , IV administration cumbersome , inconvenient expensive . A true comparison different approach undertake rigorous fashion . Prior study demonstrate safety high dose oral steroid . For proposal employ equivalent oral dosing ( 1400 mg/day ) compare 1000 mg/day IV therapy patient see within seven day acute exacerbation MS . In addition , 2 arm double-blind , placebo control , randomize trial . One arm active IV oral placebo second arm IV placebo active oral dose . Therefore , subject receive active treatment .</detailed_description>
