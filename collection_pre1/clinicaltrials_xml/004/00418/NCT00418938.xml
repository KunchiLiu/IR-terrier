	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open-label , randomize , phase 2 , two-arm clinical trial conduct United States . Approximately 210 eligible KRAS wild-type express metastatic colorectal cancer subject fail first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy ( least 4 dos oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy ) least 4 dos bevacizumab ( failure define toxicity due oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy progression disease first-line treatment ) randomize 1:1 ratio receive either once-every-two-weeks ( Q2W ) FOLFIRI regimen plus panitumumab 6 mg/kg Q2W FOLFIRI regimen plus bevacizumab ( either 5 mg/kg 10 mg/kg , depend physician choice institutional standard care ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , multicenter , open-label , randomize , two-arm study design estimate treatment effect panitumumab combination FOLFIRI compare bevacizumab combination FOLFIRI subject metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) fail first-line therapy least 4 dos oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy bevacizumab . After data become available demonstrate treatment effect antiepidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) agent limited patient wild-type Kirsten rat Sarcoma-2 virus ( KRAS ) mCRC , study amend enroll subject wild-type KRAS tumor . Eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive panitumumab 6 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI every 2 week ( Q2W ) bevacizumab 5 mg/kg 10 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI Q2W . Randomization stratify reason first-line treatment failure ( progression v toxicity ) intend bevacizumab dose ( 5 mg/kg v 10 mg/kg ) . The intended bevacizumab dos ascertain site time site initiation . Subjects treat component second-line treatment occurrence unacceptable adverse event , disease progression , death , loss follow , study withdrawal subject , investigator , sponsor . Tumor response evaluate blinded central radiology review per modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.0 investigator use either modified RECIST version 1.0 clinical assessment . After subject permanently discontinue component second-line treatment , undergo safety follow-up assessment 30 ( ± 7 ) day last dose . Subjects end second-line treatment disease progression follow PFS ( radiographic disease assessment ) every 12 week ( ± 14 day ) safety follow-up visit disease progression , initiation new therapy mCRC , approximately 100 PFS event observed subject wild-type KRAS tumor . Subjects also follow survival every 12 week ( ± 14 day ) safety follow-up assessment approximately 100 PFS event observed subject wild-type KRAS tumor .</detailed_description>
