	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin , Gemcitabine Bevacizumab Women With Recurrent Mullerian Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The study treatment divide period call cycle . Each cycle 28 day long . Participants give study drug intravenously day 1 day 15 cycle . - Gemcitabine give first , period 30 minute . Then oxaliplatin period 2 hour . Finally , bevacizumab give period 30 90 minute . Participants continue study treatment long tumor grow experience unacceptable side effect . If tumor go away completely , participant 2 cycle study treatment . - Blood drawn routine testing every week study treatment check side effect . Before day 1 15 cycle follow test procedure perform : medical history ; complete physical exam ; vital sign ; blood test ; urine test . Before day 1 every cycle , follow additional procedure perform : A CT scan , x-ray ultrasound abdomen pelvis ; x-ray chest ( require study doctor ) ; blood test ; urine sample . - If participant 's tumor go away , ask return clinic follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . At follow-up visit follow test procedure perform : medical history ; complete physical examination ; CT scan , x-ray ultrasound abdomen pelvis ; x-ray chest ; test doctor feel need . - There optional sub-study six subject ask take part give study doctor important information way body use break study drug . This sub-study involve special surgical procedure scan do cycle 1 study treatment .</detailed_description>
