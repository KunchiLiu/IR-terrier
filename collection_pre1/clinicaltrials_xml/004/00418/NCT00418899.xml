	<brief_summary>The goal research study investigate role gene may point high risk develop glioma . Researchers use new gene map technique study high-risk factor pass family 's gene increase risk develop glioma . Objectives : We propose international multi-center , multidisciplinary study consortium , GLIOGENE , identify susceptibility gene high-risk familial brain tumor pedigree use sophisticated genetic analysis method available . To address hypothesis , propose follow specific aim : Aim 1 : Establish cohort 400 high-risk pedigree genetic linkage analysis . To date , identify collect biologic sample 20 high-risk family meet criterion 2 relative diagnose brain tumor . From 15 center United States Europe , screen obtain epidemiologic data approximately 17,080 gliomas case identify target 400 family genetic analysis . We establish cohort first second-degree relative glioma case obtain new knowledge cancer aggregate glioma family . We also acquire biospecimens ( blood tumor tissue ) , risk factor data relevant family member . Aim 2 : Identify candidate region link familial brain tumor . To strengthen evidence linkage region find preliminary analysis identify additional region link brain tumor , genotype informative glioma pedigree identify aim 1 use Affymetrix 10K GeneChip marker space throughout genome , conduct genome-wide multipoint linkage scan marker . Aim 3 : Fine map region establish Aim 2 genotyping select SNPs genome database . We attempt refine region identify Aim 2 less 1cM use approximately 1,500 - 2,000 carefully select SNPs . The prioritization region base combination strength evidence linkage family various ethnic background presence obvious candidate gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A consortium ( group ) researcher want learn glioma well risk factor ( environmental genetic information ) patient kind brain tumor . Participants study part glioma genetic epidemiology study ( herein refer `` GLIOGENE '' ) involve eleven center United States ( U.S. ) five center Europe . The eleven center U.S. : The University Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MD Anderson ) ; Baylor College Medicine , Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) ; Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) ; Case Western Reserve University ( CWRU ) ; Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMD ) ; Duke University ( Duke ) ; Mayo Clinic Rochester ( Mayo ) ; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) ; University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) ; University Illinois , Chicago ( UIC ) ; Evanston Northwest Healthcare ( ENWH ) . The five center Europe : Gertner Institute , Israel ( Gertner ) ; Institute Cancer Epidemiology , Denmark ( ICE ) ; Institute Cancer Research ( ICR ) , United Kingdom ( U.K. ) ; Tampere University Hospital ( TU ) Umeå University Hospital , Sweden ( Umeå ) . If agree take part study , 3 tablespoon blood drawn . If unable donate blood , researcher collect saliva sample . In addition , 2 family member glioma , train research interviewer ask question use questionnaire take 30-40 minute complete . The topic questionnaire include demographic data ( age race ) , environmental exposure , medical history , family history cancer condition , lifestyle factor . Study staff use name contact information relatives potential research participant provide MD Anderson order contact individual find eligible desire participate study . Before blood and/or saliva send TCH banking , name personal identifying information cod protect privacy . MD Anderson oversight leftover blood and/or saliva bank THC additional research . Blood saliva collect used researcher involve study . Neither physician receive individual report research . Results place health record . All information keep confidential use research purpose . For result , sample , contact medical information link assign identification number ( instead name ) . In event participant participate prior glioma study conduct Melissa L. Bondy ( ID00-098 ID 91-036 ) , sign inform consent study allow u use specimens previously collect . There rare chance research team member could accidentally expose blood body fluid . If occurs , extra blood ( 2 teaspoon ) may draw test infection hepatitis HIV ( AIDS virus ) . An exist blood sample may use test instead . You tell blood test result test . Researchers ask would like receive result , phone certify letter . The test result name , address , date birth , sex record confidential MD Anderson medical record . If test positive hepatitis HIV , test result name , address , date birth , sex share appropriate health authority require law . You also give list place area receive test treatment . Your participation study data collect finalize . This investigational study . Up 17,080 participant take part multicenter study . Up 9,000 enrolled M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
