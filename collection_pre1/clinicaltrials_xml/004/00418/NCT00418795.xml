	<brief_title>Porphozym Treatment Acute Attacks AIP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective : To investigate biochemical efficacy plasma porphobilinogen ( PBG ) Porphozy ( recombinant human porphobilinogen deaminase ) subject Acute Intermittent Porphyria ( AIP ) attack clinical efficacy clinical efficacy Porphozym™ , change pain baseline 24 hour start treatment . The correlation biochemical clinical efficacy investigate well . Further safety Porphozym™ evaluate . After screen period last short possible subject enrol trial randomize treatment either Porphozym™ placebo . Treatment give 48 hour . After end treatment , subject enters observation period , last discharge hospital . Subjects follow visit 14 28 day end treatment . Additional safety follow-up perform 2 , 4 6 month end treatment . At least 36 Subjects enrol trial . The trial drug , supply Zymenex A/S , Denmark vial reconstitution water injection ( WFI ) . At start treatment bolus injection iv give decrease PBG level ot zero . This follow continuous iv infusion enzyme follow 48 hour .</detailed_description>
