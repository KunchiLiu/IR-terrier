	<brief_summary>It show woman dense breast increase risk breast cancer compare woman whose breast less dense . However , breast density may risk factor , etiology relationship breast cancer breast density understood . Furthermore , well recognize breast cancer still develop woman whose breast dense . At menopause , amount breast glandular tissue stroma naturally decrease due lack hormonal stimulation . This characterized decrease mammographic density . Although certain medication , include hormone therapy ( HT ) dopamine antagonists increase breast density , effect reversible upon discontinuation specific agent . Other medication selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERM ) , raloxifene ( RAL ) tamoxifen , show affect breast density allow normal age-related change occur . The effect bazedoxifene ( BZA ) , new SERM , breast density know . The purpose study examine effect BZA breast density change 24 month postmenopausal woman . The result may useful clinician understand effect BZA breast density mammographic effect . This observational , multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo- active comparator-controlled study . It also ancillary use woman already participant phase 3 trial fracture reduction ( protocol 3068A1-301-WW ; primary study ) . In primary study , subject receive BZA 20 mg , BZA 40 mg , RAL 60 mg , placebo . This ancillary study request subset participant use mammogram take study . Their mammogram digitize central imaging center . A single radiologist perform quantification breast density digitize mammogram .</brief_summary>
