	<brief_summary>The primary objective study identify brain region activity affect SCS . Baseline cerebral blood flow scan device turn generated compare scan produce device operate parameter produce optimal coverage painful area . The relationship cerebral blood flow pain rating score evaluate condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Cerebral Blood Flow Patients Treated With Spinal Cord Stimulation Low Back Leg Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) know effective pain management . Some evidence exists SCS may cause change cerebral blood flow . This study novel PET examination activity brain region affect SCS . This activity compare pain intensity distribution . Further , examine cerebral blood flow different dos stimulation , relationship SCS , brain perfusion , pain relief drawn . This study contribute elucidation mechanism action SCS .</detailed_description>
