	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To assess efficacy immediate release methylphenidate , sustain release methylphenidate , novel vigilance enhance drug modafinil improvement cognitive functioning patient brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Methylphenidate Versus Sustained Release Methylphenidate Cognitive Functioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All three drug use clinical research study widely use stimulant help cancer patient fatigue problem concentration . Before treatment start , physical exam , include measurement blood pressure , neuropsychological symptom evaluation . The neuropsychological evaluation make test attention , memory , speech , brain function , take 30 minute complete . The test evaluate symptom may experience , fatigue depression , take 10 minute complete . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one three treatment group .

There equal chance assign group . After randomize , contact M. D. Anderson pharmacy receive assign medication . You receive total 5 week worth medication . The extra week medication allow buffer conflict reschedule follow-up evaluation . IR methylphenidate pill take twice day . Both SR methylphenidate modafinil pill take day . The amount medicine three group . You take medication every day total 4 week . You ask complete study calendar , provide research staff . In study calendar , ask initial take study drug day , record side effect may experience . You require return complete study calendar final evaluation visit , along empty bottle study drug may leave . You remain treatment 4 week return final evaluation . A follow-up neuropsychological evaluation evaluation symptom perform . At end study treatment period , allow remain active treatment wish .
