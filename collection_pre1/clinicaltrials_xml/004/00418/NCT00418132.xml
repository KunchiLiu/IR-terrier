	<brief_title>Thalidomide Decreasing Collagen Biosynthesis People With Progressive Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Progressive systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) , also know scleroderma , disease body 's connective tissue . It characterize fibrosis skin , formation scar-like tissue , result progressively increase restriction joint range motion . Fibrosis internal organ also occur , lead irregular heart rhythm , acid reflux , respiratory problem . Unfortunately , therapy develop effectively treat SSc . The disease believe immunological disorder affect T-helper type 2 ( Th2 ) cell , stimulate production antibody interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , protein profibrotic property . T-helper type 1 ( Th1 ) cell produce interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) , protein prevents fibroblast production collagen , primary component body 's connective tissue . It possible shift disease 's target Th2 cell Th1 cell may decrease collagen production , thereby reduce fibrosis . Thalidomide immune modulatory drug show stimulate production Th1 cell . This study evaluate effectiveness thalidomide treat adult SSc . Following screening procedure , participant 48-week , double-blind study randomly assign receive placebo thalidomide dose 50 mg/day . The thalidomide dose increase 100 mg/day Week 2 , 200 mg/day Week 4 , finally 300 mg/day Week 6 . Participants experience dose intolerance immediately switch previously tolerate dose . Inpatient hospital visit last 2 day occur begin study start thalidomide treatment Weeks 16 48 . Assessments procedures visit include blood urine collection , physical exam , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram , skin biopsy , various questionnaire . Outpatient study visit occur Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 20 every 4 week Week 44 . Assessments include measure immune function , clinical disease , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , safety . Following Week 48 inpatient visit , thalidomide taper 2-week period participant .</detailed_description>
