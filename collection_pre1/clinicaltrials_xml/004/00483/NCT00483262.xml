	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety CCI-779 ( Temsirolimus ) bortezomib ( Velcade ) , high dose drug give people safely . We also look combination two drug may work multiple myeloma . CCI-779 ( Temsirolimus ) drug appear stop myeloma cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination CCI-779 ( Temsirolimus ) Bortezomib ( Velcade ) Relapsed and/or Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose CCI-779 ( Temsirolimus ) give combination bortezomib ( Velcade ) give people without cause serious unmanageable side effect , everyone participates study receive amount either drug . - During study treatment , participant give medication decrease chance allergic reaction CCI-779 ( Temsirolimus ) . After drug give , participant receive bortezomib ( Velcade ) injection follow injection CCI-779 ( Temsirolimus ) . These drug wil give week four week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ) . On fifth week ( Day 29 ) , participant give CCI-779 along drug decrease chance allergic reaction . - The cycle last 35 day occur twice doctor evaluate response . The cycle repeat 8 cycle long participant severe unmanageable side effect disease respond treatment . - While receive study treatment , participant see clinic start cycle follow : complete physical examination , blood work , urine collection , x-ray bone ( study doctor deem necessary ) electrocardiogram ( prior treatment end treatment ) - A bone skeletal survey perform end treatment measure size participant tumor . - After 8 cycle treatment participant end treatment , test perform . A physical exam , blood work , urine collection , skeletal survey , electrocardiogram , bone marrow biopsy aspirate perform .</detailed_description>
