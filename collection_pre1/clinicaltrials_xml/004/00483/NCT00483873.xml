	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect EEG 's close cardiac arrest possible use standard hospital EEG machine investigational EEG device help determine neurological status cardiac arrest patient help decide possible treatment chance recovery . The investigational EEG machine simple operate well easy interpret clinician nurse . It replace electrophysiologist interpretation determine ealy evaluation treatment help patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Arrest Recovery EEG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest claim 450,000 life per year United States alone . There high incidence neurological complication amongst survivor , represent lead cause morbidity . Over past several year , care patient improve via introduction new systemic well neurospecific therapy . Speed institution therapy appear important factor affect efficacy . Yet , crucial initial hour day post-arrest , assessment neurological status patient essentially non-existent . Thus , need objective validated tool ass prognosis track neurological status early recovery period . In response need , develop EEG base Cortical Health Index ( CHI ) . This EEG-based index incorporate multiple weighted parameter derive 2 channel ( 4 scalp electrode + 1 ground electrode ) relate neurologic functional recovery . The strength uniqueness approach result consideration temporal well spectral domain EEG . Our Phase II result demonstrate CHI measure within first 6-hours post-arrest resuscitation strongly correlate clinical outcome hospital discharge 30-patient cardiac arrest study . Together industry collaborator , propose pursue regulatory approval CHI Monitor . Our plan involve prospective clinical trial involve 4 center 100 patient ( 64 Cardiac Arrest Patients 36 patient undergoing ICD placement control ) . We test ability CHI : 1 ) provide early prediction subsequent neurological functional outcome cardiac arrest patient , 2 ) provide real-time track brain injury response therapy . Successful completion project define FDA clearance CHI Monitor . It goal CHI Monitor identify patient could benefit aggressive intervention , track response therapy . Providing information treat physician immediate post-resuscitation period represent major change care delivery cardiac arrest survivor .</detailed_description>
