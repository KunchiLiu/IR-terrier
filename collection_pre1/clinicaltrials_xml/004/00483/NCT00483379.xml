	<brief_summary>Pompe disease ( also know glycogen storage disease Type II ) cause deficiency critical enzyme body call acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , GAA use body 's cell break glycogen ( stored form sugar ) within specialized structure call lysosome . In patient Pompe disease , excessive amount glycogen accumulates store various tissue , especially heart skeletal muscle , prevents normal function . The objective exploratory study evaluate safety efficacy alternative dosing regimen alglucosidase alfa patient Pompe disease demonstrate optimal response standard dose regimen 20 mg/kg every week minimum 6 month treatment immediately prior study entry .</brief_summary>
