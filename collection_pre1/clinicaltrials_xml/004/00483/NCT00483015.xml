	<brief_title>Differences Presentation Outcome Response Treatment Between Never- Smokers Smokers With NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lethal malignant tumor affect human . In United States alone estimate 160,440 patient die lung cancer 2004 [ 1 ] . It well know tobacco smoke major risk factor account majority lung cancer case . But sub group patient lung cancer never actively smoked tobacco . This group exhibit certain unique characteristic separate lung cancer smoker . It show never- smoker adenocarcinoma good outcome term overall survival well lung cancer specific survival compare current smoker adenocarcinoma lung [ 2 ] . Also patient current smoker diagnosis decrease survival compare people quit smoke [ 3 ] . The improved survival never smoker could due several reason . Such increased incidence co-morbid factor smoker result exposure tobacco smoke , difference metabolism chemotherapeutic agent reflection difference underlie molecular biology tumor . It demonstrate chromosomal abnormality common lung cancer patient smoke history compare never- smoker [ 4 ] . Gene mutation p53 mutation frequent never- smoker previous smoker [ 5 ] . In addition mutation specific lung cancer never smoker discover , demonstrate possibility separate overlap carcinogenesis pathway lung cancer never smoker vs. smoker [ 6 ] .</detailed_description>
