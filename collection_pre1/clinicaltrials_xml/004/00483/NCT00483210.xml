	<brief_summary>Resistance hypoglycemic action insulin develop within 7 day bedrest young , healthy volunteer . We propose event occur elderly individual confine bed , alteration lipid metabolism , least part , responsible insulin resistance associate bedrest , accumulation intracellular triglyceride ( TG ) liver muscle play role impair insulin action . Further , propose PPARα ( Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha ) agonist fenofibrate increase tissue fatty acid disposal activate mitochondrial oxidative capacity , thereby improve insulin sensitivity . We investigate series specific hypothesis design examine role alter lipid metabolism development insulin-resistance associate bedrest . Further , since inactivity likely principal factor development insulin resistance elderly , response inactivity impose bedrest represent acceleration normal development insulin resistance elderly individual . Therefore , result study also pertinent understand mechanism responsible natural development insulin resistance free-living elderly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The accumulation intracellular lipid reflect dysregulation tissue fatty acid metabolism involve abnormal relationship tissue fatty acid uptake oxidation . It postulate dysregulation lipid metabolism cause insulin resistance direct consequence accumulate intracellular triglyceride ( TG ) , increase intracellular TG reflect increase active product fatty acid , diacylglycerol , inhibit insulin signal pathway . We recently find muscle liver intracellular TG concentration elevate one-half otherwise healthy elderly individual . We hypothesize increase tissue lipid elderly reflect alter tissue lipid metabolism put high risk development insulin resistance bedrest . Further , propose PPARα ( Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha ) agonist fenofibrate increase tissue fatty acid disposal activate mitochondrial oxidative capacity , thereby improve insulin sensitivity . We examine role alteration lipid metabolism development insulin resistance occur bedrest . Methods : A total 40 elderly subject range age 60-85 study . Subjects randomize one two group : 1 ) 10 day bedrest 2 ) 10 day bedrest plus fenofibrate . Each subject complete 5- day diet stabilization period metabolic infusion study day 5 , follow 10 day bedrest metabolic study day 18 . This follow 3 week rehabilitation program . Pre-test post bedrest measurement include body composition DEXA , intracellular TG measurement MRS , strength testing . The result provide insight mechanism responsible development insulin resistance inactivity strategy ameliorate response .</detailed_description>
