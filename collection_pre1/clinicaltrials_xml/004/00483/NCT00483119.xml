	<brief_title>Randomized Trial IVIg With Without Cyclophosphamide Pemphigus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pemphigus serious life-threatening autoimmune disease characterize blister erosion occur skin oral mucosa . It cause autoantibody attack desmoglein 1 3 , adhesion molecule present surface cell ( keratinocytes ) make superficial layer skin . As result cell stop stick together , come apart result formation blister skin . Pemphigus usually treat systemic corticosteroid often give together immunosuppressive drug Cytoxan ( cyclophosphamide ) , Imuran ( azathioprine ) , methotrexate , CellCept ( mycophenolate mofetil ) others . However , prolong high dos systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent use treat disease associate significant toxicity . A new treatment use treat pemphigus patient unresponsive , developed complication conventional treatment IVIg ( intravenous immunoglobulin ) . IVIg consist one protein fraction present blood . It fraction contain antibody call immunoglobulin ( Ig ) . It purify blood collect thousand donor treat remove potential infectious agent . It administer intravenously ( IV ) several hour , several day succession . The cycle usually repeat every 2 4 week disease control . IVIg treatment currently give either two way , either immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide azathioprine . It unknown two procedure well . This trial conduct determine treatment effective . The trial conduct patient pemphigus respond , developed complication , standard treatment . All patient treat IVIg administer use standard protocol . The IVIg give daily 4 day , cycle repeat every week total 4 cycle . In addition , half patient select chance also treat cyclophosphamide , immunosuppressive drug often use treat autoimmune diseases include pemphigus . The cyclophosphamide pill take 3 time day . A total 12 patient treated arm trial . The trial conduct Dr. Jean-Claude Bystryn New York University Medical Center . The extent activity disease , well blood level pemphigus antibody , measure baseline prior entry trial periodically trial . The goal study determine whether difference two treatment rate : 1 ) activity extent disease improve , 2 ) dose corticosteroid require treat disease reduce , 3 ) blood level pemphigus antibody decrease . This trial test hypothesis examine whether IVIg treatment give cyclophosphamide result rapid decline circulate pemphigus antibody give alone .</detailed_description>
