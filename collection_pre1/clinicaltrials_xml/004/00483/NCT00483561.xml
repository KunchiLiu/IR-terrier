	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving gefitinib together etoposide may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gefitinib together etoposide work treat patient advanced prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Etoposide Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine activity gefitinib etoposide , term overall response rate , patient hormone-refractory advanced prostate cancer previously treat docetaxel-based therapy . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine whether related biomarkers help predict response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 oral etoposide daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study correlative study . Blood sample analyze enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay biomarkers ( e.g. , VEGF , basic fibroblast growth factor , anti-EGFR antibody titer ) order determine whether one biomarkers predict response . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
