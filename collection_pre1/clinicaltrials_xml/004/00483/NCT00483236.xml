	<brief_title>Prospective Study Looking Quality Life Measures Non-ischaemic Cardiomyopathy After Mitral Valve Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Chronic mitral regurgitation ( MR ) usually spiral vicious cycle leave ventricular ( LV ) volume overload , LV dilatation , mitral annular dilatation MR. `` MR begets MR '' . Eventually symptoms LV dysfunction ensue . However , often treat medically surgically . Medical therapy primarily afterload reduction diuretic . Surgically , two option , either mitral valve repair replacement . - A number retrospective study demonstrate improved LV function survival patient undergoing valve repair compare valve replacement without subvalvular preservation . In one report , example , patient underwent valve repair compare patient underwent valve replacement . The report find former group lower operative mortality , great increase LV ejection fraction high overall ten year survival . - The bulk literature present address leave ventricular dimension , ejection fraction , geometry New York Heart Association functional class , address quality life measure . In addition , study retrospective majority patient concomitant ischaemic heart disease . - Even though study concern quality life mitral valve surgery , nevertheless , address isolated valve surgery without concomitant bypass surgery show improve quality life , though follow limit 3 month . We follow population 12 month surgical repair . - We primarily look subjective measure quality life Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire &amp; Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire , subjective measure become important follow cardiac surgery . Patients serve control study parameter compare pre- post surgery .</detailed_description>
