	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving imatinib mesylate together gemcitabine capecitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose gemcitabine capecitabine give together imatinib mesylate treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine combine imatinib mesylate patient advance solid tumor . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . Secondary - Explore antitumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study gemcitabine capecitabine . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily day 1-5 8-12 , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 3 10 , oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 2 course absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Existing paraffin-embedded tissue block patient diagnose melanoma renal cell carcinoma assess c-kit mutation polymerase chain reaction direct sequence juxtamembrane domain ( exon 9 11 ) tyrosine kinase domain ( exon 13 17 ) . ( Begins 12-11-2008 ) PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Closed patient accrual 12/11/2008 .</detailed_description>
