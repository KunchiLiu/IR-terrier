	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tissue blood laboratory patient cancer receive epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor may help doctor understand effect EGFR inhibitor therapy skin . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look effect EGFR inhibitor skin cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor Therapy Skin Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine effect EGFR inhibitor EGFR pathway skin cancer patient prior receive EGFR inhibitor ( i.e. , tyrosine kinase inhibitor monoclonal antibody ) . - Compare effect EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor vs monoclonal antibody EGFR pathway skin patient . - Compare change EGFR pathway grade rash patient . - Compare change EGFR pathway effector skin serum TGFα level patient . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients undergo skin punch biopsy blood sample collection baseline , within 1 week develop skin rash , 6 week begin treatment . Samples analyze immunohistochemistry western blot phosphorylated MAP kinase , AKT , EGF level TGFα level . Patients also complete diagram indicate location rash weekly first 6 week treatment .</detailed_description>
