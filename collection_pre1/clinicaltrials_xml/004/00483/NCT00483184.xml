	<brief_title>Low Dose Interferon Alpha Treatment Oral Ulcers Behcet 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behçet 's disease severe chronic relapse inflammatory disorder mark oral genital ulcer , uveitis skin lesion , well vary multisystem involvement include joint , blood vessel , central nervous system , gastrointestinal tract . Oral ulcer initial symptom Behçet 's case single manifestation disease require official diagnosis , along two hallmark symptom . Ninety ( 90 ) patient enrol randomize , parallel , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate effectiveness low dose natural human IFN α administer oral mucosal route reduce number , size , incidence pain oral ulcer patient Behçet 's disease . The clinical trial consist 3 group patient randomize 1:1:1 ratio twice daily receive 2 lozenge contain 500 IU IFN α ( 2,000 IU daily , n=30 ) , one active ( 500 IU ) one placebo lozenge ( 1,000 IU daily , n=30 ) 2 placebo lozenge ( n=30 ) . Subjects monitor weekly initial 4 week treatment bi-weekly additional 8 week treatment . Medication self-administered 2 lozenge take twice daily ( morning evening ) . Oral lesion count measure study visit , patient answer series questionnaire . Results subject statistical analysis completion study , change total ulcer burden patient , measurement total oral mucosal surface area involve ulcerous lesion visit , serve primary endpoint . The total ulcer burden treat visit compare baseline total ulcer burden amount change determine . Patients 75 % decrease total ulcer burden consider responder .</detailed_description>
