	<detailed_description>The trial 's objective study efficacy , define complete pathologic resolution disease , standard hormonal regimen progestin Megace treatment atypical endometrial hyperplasia well moderately differentiate endometrial carcinoma woman desire conservative medical management condition Women 's Cancer Program NYU School Medicine Bellevue Gynecologic Oncology clinic . The major endpoint pathologic complete response ( pCR ) . For purpose study , patient reevaluate response every 12 week complete response . Response assess within 4 week completion 12 week Megace , endometrial biopsy dilation curettage ( D &amp; C ) /hysteroscopy . An endometrial biopsy sufficient document progressive , stable disease partial response . A D &amp; C necessary confirm complete response . Patients whose disease completely respond discontinue treatment encourage pursue fertility . Those desire immediate fertility place low dose oral contraceptive pill least 6 month . Patients either partial response stable disease recounseled offer continue medical management surgical therapy . Patients whose disease progress offer definitive surgical management .
