	<brief_summary>Rationale : A safety dose define study investigator hypothesize patient acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation ( NSTEMI ) treatment heme arginate result well clinical outcome induce heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) pathway . Objective : 1 ) Is induction HO-1 degradation product , especially bilirubin , safe patient acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation ; 2 ) What optimal effective dose administer patient NSTEMI ; 3 ) Are HO-1 degradation product endogenously activate patient acute coronary syndrome ; 4 ) Does treatment heme arginate result less cardiac damage ; 5 ) Which cardioprotecting pathway activate administration heme arginate ? Study population : Male female patient confirm acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation , 18 - 80 yr old . Intervention : 10 patient receive single administration heme arginate ( 3 mg/kg ) , administer intravenously 15 minute directly admission ; 10 patient receive two administration heme arginate ( 3 mg/kg ) day 0 1 ; 10 patient receive three administration heme arginate ( 3 mg/kg ) day 0 , 1 2 admission , administer intravenously 15 minute . To determine endogenous level HO-1 time course HO-1 activation NSTEMI , blood drawn assay perform 15 patient NSTEMI . As control blood test , blood drawn assay perform 15 patient non-typical angina pectoris cardiac disease could detect investigator out-patient clinic . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint incidence rate adverse event three treat group . This include hemodynamic monitoring , rhythm monitoring biochemical hematological difference three treat group . Secondary endpoint difference baseline heme arginate treat group activity HO-1 pathway , include , limited , HO-1 activity , free heme , bilirubin ( direct indirect ) level , serum ferritin , carbon monoxide ( CO ) . Furthermore , difference heme arginate treat group NTproBNP , CK-MB Troponin T difference heme arginate treat subject LVEF measure echocardiography , 3 7 day 6 month NSTEMI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The interventional part study single centre safety dose define pilot study patient allocate heme arginate infusion 1 day ( hem-1d ) , heme arginate infusion 2 day , heme arginate infusion 3 day ( hem-3d ) consecutive order . So , three patient group consist three intervention group . Based upon pharmacokinetic data porphyria patient ( 3 mg/kg/day 4-7 day ) , investigator rationalize 3 fixed dos heme arginate optimal dose counter attack acute phase NSTEMI . Longer infusion heme arginate seem moment rational . The investigator first administer 10 patient 1 dose heme arginate ( hem-1d , day 0 ) ass safety . If safety assure hem-1d group , 10 patient receive two day heme arginate infusion ( day 0 1 ) . After group complete safety assure , third group ( n = 10 ) receive heme arginate infusion three consecutive day NSTEMI ( day 0 , 1 2 admission ) . Heme arginate consider safe NSTEMI patient adverse event occur consecutive group . To assess safety course study follow possible event monitor : - New onset myocardial infarction ST-elevation ( STEMI ) ; - Cardiac decompensation ; - Sustained ventricular arrhythmia require defibrillation ; - All cause death ; - Drop mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) 20 mmHg ( MAP define 2 x diastolic blood pressure + 1 x systolic blood pressure divide 3 ( MAP = 2 x Pdias + Psys / 3 ) ) ; - Eosinophilia ( &gt; 0.5 x 109/l ) combination fever and/or rash and/or shiver anaphylactic shock ; - Renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine 300 µmol/l ) ; - ASAT ALAT elevate least 3 time upper limit normal ; - Severe hematological abnormality , define thrombocytopenia &lt; 40 x 109/l , leucocytopenia &lt; 2.0 x 109/l , hemolytic anemia ; - Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) elevate least 3 time upper limit normal ; - Severe bleeding , define require blood transfusion . In event one mention effect occur , investigator report METC deliberate continue study . If , deliberation METC , heme arginate turn safe NSTEMI patient , inclusion patient terminate immediately patient already receive heme arginate follow thoroughly . The investigator take care subject keep inform . After completion group METC inform progress study . Regardless allocation , patient receive care usual accord national/international guideline 79 , 80 . Patients NSTEMI , admit University Medical Center Groningen ( UMCG ) , ask participate study sign inform consent . After sign consent , blood drawn via venipuncture baseline data . On day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 180 NSTEMI blood drawn additional measurement . Echocardiography perform determine leave ventricular function , include leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , 3 day , 7 day 180 day . To assess possible anti-hypertensive component heme arginate treatment , 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure recording conduct day 7 6 month NSTEMI . The following component heme pathway determine : free heme , hemoglobin , ferritin , carbon monoxide , heme oxygenase ( HO ) -1 , biliverdin , direct non direct bilirubin . To monitor safety , investigator evaluate liver enzyme ( ALAT , ASAT , γ-GT , AP , LDH ) , clot time ( INR , APTT , PT ) , electrolytes ( Na , K , Cl , Mg ) furthermore regular hematology ( Hb , Ht , thrombocytes ) chemistry ( Blood Urea Nitrogen , Creatinine , CK , CK-MB , Troponin T , Brain Natriuretic Peptide , VEGF Erythropoietin ) . All participant also ask blood ass DNA polymorphisms affect HO-1 activity , HO-1 polymorphism , assessment quality endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) . Total number include patient interventional part study 30 patient . Follow-up complete 6 month inclusion last patient . The investigator estimate inclusion take approximately 6 month . The study duration therefore come total least 12 month . The maximal duration study 18 month , include analysis result . In addition , two group patient ask non-interventional part study : 1 . The investigator hypothesize due acute coronary syndrome HO-1 activate , low level clinical benefit . To determine time course HO-1 activity degradation product NSTEMI , investigator draw blood perform assay 15 patient NSTEMI describe . It possible use assay execute interventional part study , heme arginate infusion interfere outcomes . 2 . As healthy control blood test gain insight normal level HO-1 activity , investigator draw blood baseline assay 15 patient non-typical angina pectoris cardiac disease could detect out-patient clinic . All patient ask participate non-intervention part study , receive separate information letter sign inform consent form . If consent give , blood drawn via venipuncture .</detailed_description>
