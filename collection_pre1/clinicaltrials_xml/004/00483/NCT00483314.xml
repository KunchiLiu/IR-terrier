	<brief_title>Homocystinuria : Treatment With N-Acetylcysteine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Homocystinuria ( MIM 236200 ) due CBS deficiency common inborn error sulfur amino acid metabolism severe clinical manifestation . We propose : 1 . An open-label pilot study N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) low plasma homocysteine level respond conventional treatment include betaine ( Cystadane® , Orphan Medical Inc. ) , lower Hcy level normalize , expensive . There known contraindication NAC use nutritional supplementation relatively inexpensive . Oral NAC reduce total plasma homocysteine healthy subject dose-dependent fashion . 2 . Measurement flow-mediated vasodilation brachial artery ( endothelial function ) response NAC treatment . Endothelial dysfunction precursor atherogenesis . 3 . Sequencing CBS gene individual order identify novel mutation cause homocystinuria identify polymorphism gene may affect response treatment .</detailed_description>
