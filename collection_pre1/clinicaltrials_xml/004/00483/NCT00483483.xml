	<detailed_description>Russia one fast grow AIDS epidemic world , estimate 1 million HIV-infected person . Initially Russian HIV epidemic almost exclusively among injection drug user ( IDUs ) ; however , concern exists HIV expand general population via sexual transmission . Alcohol use , highly prevalent Russia , may increase high-risk sexual behavior among IDUs alcohol dependent person . Furthermore , animal model suggest alcohol consumption play permissive role HIV replication resultant high viral load may increase risk transmission . Thus alcohol use may accelerate HIV transmission general population Russia . The study randomize 700 HIV-infected patient risky alcohol consumption adapt Healthy Relationships Intervention ( HRI ) attention-control support group . The intervention culturally adapt modified address substance use associate risk behavior . Subjects participate HRI attend three 90-120 min structure group session addition two 30-60 min individualize session course 5-10 day . Subjects attention-control group participate general health information session format ( i.e. , 2 individualize 3 group session ) timeframe . All patient assess baseline ( pre-randomization ) 6-months 12-months post-randomization recruitment site . Primary outcome HIV sex drug risk behavior sexually transmit disease . Additionally , subject assess regard secondary outcome include alcohol consumption , quality life social support , victimization , suicide , overdose , disclosure HIV serostatus . We hypothesize relative comparison group , participant receive adapt Healthy Relationships Intervention reduce HIV sex drug risk behavior STD acquisition .
