	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab recently show improve survival combine chemotherapy patient previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer . Bevacizumab usually give together infusional 5-FU , require central line . A central line inconvenient patient , may increase risk infection , thrombosis . Furthermore , central line increase resource demand interventional radiology , chemo daycare . Capecitabine administer orally , convert 5-FU intracellularly . Chronic administration capecitabine mimic infusional 5-FU . This study design evaluate whether combination irinotecan , capecitabine bevacizumab effective first-line therapy patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Bevacizumab , Irinotecan Capecitabine Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FOLFIRI regimen become standard 1st line therapy metastatic colorectal cancer Canada . This regimen consist irinotecan combination bolus 5-FU/leucovorin , follow 46-hour infusional 5-FU every 2 week . It require central line infusion pump deliver 5-FU , necessitates least 2 visit chemotherapy unit every 2 week , incur additional cost inconvenience patient , also increase risk complication thrombosis infection due central line . In addition , due resource limitation , patient often wait several week central line placement . The XELIRI ( irinotecan capecitabine ) regimen use Princess Margaret Hospital ( PMH ) first-line treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer since May , 2003 . The choice XELIRI FOLFIRI make effort reduce demand resource , enable patient start therapy sooner , increase patient convenience potentially reduce complication associated central venous access . The regimen consist irinotecan 250 mg/m2 IV day 1 capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 PO BID day 1-14 every 3 week . The dose reduce irinotecan 200 mg/m2 day 1 capecitabine 750 mg/m2 patient &gt; 65 year old patient renal impairment . So far , 101 patient treated regimen PMH . Among 76 patient evaluable response , 34 confirm partial response ( 44.7 % ) 18 patient stable disease ( 23.7 % ) , disease control rate 68.4 % . Furthermore , regimen well tolerate main side effect diarrhea neutropenia . With availability bevacizumab , 12 patient treat XELIRI regimen combination bevacizumab PMH part BEAT ( Bevcizumab Expanded Access Trial ) study October , 2005 . Of 10 patient treat 3 cycle chemotherapy , 7 confirm partial response 2 additional patient stable disease . One patient non-measurable evaluable disease mark reduction infiltration sacrum . There instance GI perforation , febrile neutropenia , toxic death . The median number cycle treatment 6 , 9 12 patient still receive treatment . There , however , total 8 dose reduction capecitabine 6 patient , majority dose reduction result hand-foot syndrome . Although efficacy toxicity data extremely encouraging , small number patient limit potential application data.Because encourage preliminary result , necessary conduct prospective clinical study evaluate efficacy toxicity irinotecan , capecitabine bevacizumab combination ( XELIRI-A regimen ) first-line chemotherapy patient advance colorectal cancer . Results study would provide scientific basis randomize phase III study compare XELIRI-A regimen IFL ( FOLFIRI ) + bevacizumab regimen . Furthermore , practical implication centre . Compared infusional bolus 5-FU base regimen , XELIRI-A regimen reduce workload chemotherapy daycare unit drug cost , reduce demand resource infusion pump interventional radiology time , enable patient start therapy sooner , improve patient convenience .</detailed_description>

See section 11.2 evaluation measurable disease . Patients must previous chemotherapy treatment investigational agent recurrent metastatic disease . Prior chemotherapy adjuvant set colorectal cancer acceptable . Prior surgery radiotherapy recurrent metastatic disease acceptable , however , patient must adequately recovered effect treatment . At least 6 week must elapse major surgery 4 week must elapse radiation therapy . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use bevacizumab combination capecitabine irinotecan patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Estimated life expectancy great 3 month .
