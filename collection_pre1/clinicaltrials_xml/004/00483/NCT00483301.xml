	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial OF Carboplatin , ABI-007 ( Abraxane ) And Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective phase II multicenter trial : Measure response rate ( RR ) combination schedule patient metastatic melanoma The secondary objective : Assess safety toxicity regimen patient population Determine 1-year median PFS patient treat accord protocol Determine overall survival ( OS ) STUDY DESIGN This Phase II study single arm study two-stage design maximum sample size 43 patient , 18 first stage 25 second stage . Study duration : A minimum yearly accrual 10-15 patients/institution expect . Therefore , reach first stage , study take 1.2 1.8 year one institution , 0.6 0.9 year 2 institution , 0.4 0.6 year 3 . If study continue full accrual 43 patient , completion take 2.9 4.3 year one institution , 1.4 2.2 year two 0.96 1.43 year three institution .</detailed_description>
