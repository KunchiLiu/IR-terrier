	<criteria>1 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . 2 . Age 18 year old . 3 . A performance status score 0 , 1 , 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Scale . 4 . Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed advanced solid tumor . 5 . Failed conventional therapy tumor type ; subject tumor type standard effective therapy exist ; subject singleagent topotecan therapy suitable . 6 . Completion 24hour urine collection within 14 day prior first dose calculate creatinine clearance value determine renal impairment category ( refer Appendix 8 ) . 7 . Using CockcroftGault formula ( refer Appendix 6 ) , documentation stable renal function perform within 14 day first schedule dose study medication use least 2 serum creatinine value separate minimum 7 day . Stable renal function define : 1 . ≤25 % change CrCl &lt; 40 mL/min 2 . ≤10 mL/min change CrCl ≥40 mL/min NOTE : Documentation stable renal function NOT require 24hour urine collection determine renal impairment category complete within 7 day prior first dose . Currently undergoing dialysis . Pregnant lactating . Women childbearing potential refuse either abstain sexual intercourse practice adequate contraception Male subject female partner childbearing potential prior vasectomy male subject female partner refuse use adequate contraception begin 14 day exposure study drug , continue throughout clinical trial , period 3 month last dose study drug . Uncontrolled emesis , regardless etiology . Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN . SGOT/AST , SGPT/ALT alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) evidence potentially associate metastasis ( e.g. , liver bone ) compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . If potentially associate metastasis ( e.g. , liver bone ) present , subject &lt; 5 time ULN eligible participate , follow discussion approval GSK Medical Monitor . Hematological value outside acceptable range . Active infection . Prior anticancer therapy , include , limited , chemotherapy ( except nitrosurea mitomycin C ) , radiotherapy , biologic therapy , investigational therapy major surgery within 21 day first schedule dose study drug . Prior nitrosurea mitomycin C chemotherapy within 6 week first schedule dose study drug . Failure recover Grade 1 good toxicity ( except alopecia ) relate prior anticancer therapy Day 1 , Course 1 unless agree GSK Medical Monitor Investigator . Clinical evidence gastrointestinal ( GI ) condition ( i.e. , removal portion stomach , recent GI obstruction GI neuropathy ) take drug would alter GI absorption motility . Currently take require treatment cyclosporin A. Concurrent severe medical problem unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose subject extreme risk ( include major surgery within 21 day placement biliary stent nephrostomy tube within 7 day ) . History allergic reaction topotecan compound chemically related topotecan ( e.g. , irinotecan ) .</criteria>
