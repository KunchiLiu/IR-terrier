	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness NeoDisc compare anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) treatment single-level cervical disc disease , demonstrate non-inferior comparative result 24 month follow-up period pertaining ( 1 ) improvement Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) score , ( 2 ) revision/reoperation/removal rate , ( 3 ) complication rate , ( 4 ) maintenance improvement neurologic status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating The Safety Effectiveness The NeoDisc™ Versus ACDF Subjects With Single-Level Cervical Disc Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NeoDisc artificial cervical intervertebral disc replacement intend clinical use follow discectomy . Implantation device result artificial replacement pathologically damage surgically remove cervical disc . Use device also obviate need harvest bone graft patient 's iliac crest , common painful part current surgical technique . The NeoDisc indicate cervical spinal arthroplasty skeletally mature subject symptomatic cervical disc disease one level C3 C7 . Symptomatic cervical disc disease define image-confirmed herniated disc , spondylosis , and/or loss disc height , functional neurological deficit ( i.e. , exhibit least one sign associate cervical level treat , include abnormal reflex , decrease motor strength , abnormal dermatome sensitivity , pain dermatomal distribution ) .</detailed_description>

Spondylosis define MRI CTconfirmed disc dessication , loss disc height , bridge osteophyte , and/or uncovertebral arthrosis . Loss disc height specify measurement least 25 % le adjacent nonsymptomatic level , minimum 1mm height remain .
