	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer type cancer begin large intestine ( colon ) rectum ( end colon ) . Several drug often give combination treat colorectal cancer . One active treatment combination know FOLFOX , combination 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin , oxaliplatin . Oxaliplatin type platinum drug approve FDA 2004 . While generally well-tolerated , oxaliplatin may cause toxicity nerve , sensory loss cold sensitivity . Picoplatin new type platinum drug show activity 5-FU pre-clinical study undergo extensive Phase 1 Phase 2 test variety cancer . No significant nerve toxicity see previous study picoplatin . This study review safety effectiveness FOLPI , combination 5-FU leucovorin picoplatin participant colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Picoplatin Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize centrally treatment picoplatin administer either every two every four week assign dose picoplatin dependent study result date . Each patient also receive therapy every two week 5-FU leucovorin . In schedule , cohort size 3 subject , expand 6 subject dose-limiting toxicity observe . If dose-limiting toxicity observe among 3 subject within cohort , picoplatin dose escalation may proceed , maximum tolerate dose establish .</detailed_description>
