	<detailed_description>The extent recovery brain injury often difficult predict limit understand brain change heals . New brain image method may help regard . One imaging technique call functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) make possible study brain `` work '' ; , see region brain active particular task focus attention , make decision , remember word picture . Another MRI method call diffusion tensor image provide information pathway brain region may alter brain injury . The goal research 1 ) determine brain region involve make accurate judgment one 's ability disabilities brain injury whether damage brain area affect outcome ; 2 ) examine recovery cognitive physical ability relate change brain function time . In order accomplish first goal recruit Veterans sustain head injury match control subject . For second goal , ask patient control previously participate brain injury research lab come back another visit three year post-injury .</detailed_description>
