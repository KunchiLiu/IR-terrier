	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Gallbladder Cancer Bile Duct Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine objective response rate duration objective response patient HER2/neu-positive advanced gallbladder biliary tract cancer treat trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability drug patient . II . Assess progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
