	<brief_summary>The purpose study use fMRI technique explore certain part brain associate Alzheimer 's disease know posterior cingulate . Determining functionality brain region may help u diagnose AD accurately , thus allow earlier treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posterior Cingulate Function Persons With Risk Factors Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The posterior cingulate key brain region suggest recent study affect people risk Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . Because PC affect early course AD region may reduce function even prior onset symptom , understand functional role relationship brain region may helpful detect AD earlier monitor disease progression treatment . This project examine role PC connection brain region use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , technique allow u examine brain work test memory decision-making . The main goal see functional connection brain region modulate risk AD .</detailed_description>
