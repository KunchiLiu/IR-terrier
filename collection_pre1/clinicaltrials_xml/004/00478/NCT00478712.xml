	<detailed_description>Hirschsprung disease ( HSCR ) birth defect result absence nerve ( ganglion ) cell gastrointestinal tract . Hirschsprung disease population incidence 1/5000 live birth often occur isolated condition . However , approximately 30 % HSCR case associate birth defect Down syndrome , deafness , hypopigmentation , congenital central hypoventilation syndrome . Hirschsprung disease genetic condition autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , multigenic pattern inheritance describe . Dr. Aravinda Chakravarti 's laboratory Johns Hopkins University investigate genetics Hirschsprung disease ( HSCR ) twenty five year . The goal research study identify gene harbor causative HSCR mutation well understand complex inheritance HSCR family whole genome mapping sequence study . Specifically , study aim determine frequency mutation human gene lead familial isolated form HSCR . Further , study collect clinical information investigate possible genotype - phenotype correlation . Molecular analysis use marker sequence , statistical analysis data use identify region human chromosome putative HSCR disease gene may locate . In addition , DNA sequence know and/or suspect HSCR gene assess individual patient family member , search causative HSCR susceptibility variant variant may affect presentation disease treatment outcomes . Phenotypic information include pathology , surgical , clinical outcome relate Hirschsprung disease . This study hopefully lead well understanding genetics HSCR , road , improve diagnosis , treatment , genetic counseling . This study ask volunteer : 1 . Complete medical/family history questionnaire 2 . Provide access medical record 3 . Submit blood sample individual ( ) affect Hirschsprung disease his/her parent ( available )</detailed_description>
