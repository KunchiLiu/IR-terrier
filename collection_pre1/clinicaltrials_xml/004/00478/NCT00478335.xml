	<brief_title>Pharmacologic Treatment Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve use investigational medication sildenafil calcitonin . These medication show promise treatment NDI laboratory ( non-human ) study use treatment NDI human . At time , guarantee investigational medication provide additional benefit people NDI . The study open male , age 5 25 year diagnose Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) normal kidney bladder function . A total 40 patient NDI enrol study . The study involve two outpatient clinic visit , follow 9-night hospital stay , follow final follow-up outpatient clinic visit . All visit take place within 20-day time period . At first clinic visit , blood urine test kidney liver function blood count perform . If genetic alteration cause NDI previously identify , blood DNA testing also obtain . If kidney bladder ultrasound perform past 6 month , obtain . The ultrasound make sure problem drainage urine kidney bladder . You ask fill food preference questionnaire use plan meal hospital stay . You give container collect two consecutive 24-hour urine sample home . These urine collection help determine well routine medicine work control NDI . At second clinic visit , bring two 24-hour urine sample . Blood collect test kidney function . You give container collect another 24-hour urine prior hospital visit . The third visit require hospital admission schedule study site close home ( The Children 's Hospital , Denver , Colorado ; University Aarhus , Denmark ) . For hospital visit , need stop usual NDI medication 48 hour prior visit . You perform another 24-hour urine collection day prior hospital admission . This urine sample turn laboratory admitted hospital research study . The length hospital stay 10 days/9 night . During stay , expect weight , heart rate , blood pressure check three time day . All urine collect . Blood test perform every day . You need eat meal provide hospital ; meal provide accord low-salt diet restriction . You may drink fluid desire need avoid caffeine-containing beverage alcohol . On first day hospital stay , test perform confirm diagnosis NDI . This test involve administration medicine dDAVP ( Desmopressin ) IV catheter ( vein ) collection urine every 30 minute 4 hour . You randomize ( like toss coin ) receive either investigational medication treatment 4 day follow routine medication treatment 4 day vice versa . When receive routine medication treatment , receive placebo ( inactive substance like sugar pill ) place investigational medicine . In way , neither investigator know whether receive investigational routine medication treatment first . Medicines give twice day hospital stay . On last day hospital stay , instructed resume normal diet medication . At final outpatient clinic visit , blood test urinalysis perform . Potential benefit participation include no-cost health examination , laboratory study , evaluation current management NDI . There cost participation research study . No pay give participant research study . This research study approve ethical review board follow institution : Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ( # 06-0588 ) , Emory University Institutional Review Board ( # 729-2005 ) , University Aarhus ( # 20050183 ) . Individuals decide take part research study need sign specific consent form participate institution well release use personal health information ( HIPAA form ) .</detailed_description>
