	<brief_title>Comparison 23 mg Donepezil Sustained Release ( SR ) 10 mg Donepezil Immediate Release ( IR ) Patients With Moderate Severe Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group comparison 23 mg donepezil SR currently market donepezil formulation ( 10 mg donepezil IR ) patient moderate severe Alzheimer 's disease . Patients must take 10 mg IR ( bioequivalent generic ) least 3 month prior Screening . The study consist 24 week daily administration study medication , clinic visit Screening , Baseline , 3 week ( safety ) , 6 week , 12 week , 18 week 24 week early termination . Patients receive either 10 mg donepezil IR combination placebo correspond 23 mg donepezil SR , 23 mg donepezil SR combination placebo correspond 10 mg donepezil IR . A total approximately 1600 patient enrol obtain complete data approximately 1200 complete patient ( Revised per Amendment 02 ) . During Baseline visit , patient randomize 2:1 ratio ( 23 mg donepezil SR 10 mg donepezil IR ) . The study perform approximately 200 global site ( Asia , Oceania , Europe , India , Israel , North America , South Africa , South America ) ( Revised per Amendments 01 02 ) . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) establish review safety aspect study evaluate result plan interim analysis . Patients complete study may eligible undergo evaluation enrollment open-label extension study , E2020-G000-328 .</detailed_description>
