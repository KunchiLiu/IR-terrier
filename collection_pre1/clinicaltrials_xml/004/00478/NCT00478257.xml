	<brief_summary>Patients treat chemotherapy complain poor sleep , fatigue depression . In addition , chemotherapy disrupts body 's internal `` biological clock '' , may make sleep , fatigue depression worse . Women breast cancer undergo chemotherapy expose much bright light may also contribute disruption body clock , bright light necessary strong biological clock . One easy way strengthen biological clock increase bright light exposure . The correct timing light exposure help woman feel alert day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients treat chemotherapy complain poor sleep , fatigue depression . Our preliminary research suggest symptom may relate , chemotherapy disrupts circadian rhythm may exacerbate poor sleep fatigue chemotherapy , woman expose much bright light likely also contribute disruption rhythm . One easy circadian rhythm measure sleep/wake activity easy way synchronize rhythm bright light treatment . It well establish bright light exposure make rhythm robust , correct time light exposure alert effect . We hypothesize bright light treatment compare dim light treatment three cycle chemotherapy : fatigue ( measure Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory ) , depression ( measure Center Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale ) , functional outcome score ( measure Functional Outcome Sleep Questionnaire Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast ) , sleep measure ( measure actigraphy , e.g. , total sleep time , total wake time , bout sleep , nap ) improve . We also hypothesize circadian rhythm ( measure actigraphy ) robust synchronize . The aims examine effect bright light treatment subjective measure fatigue , mood functional outcome experience chemotherapy , examine effect bright light treatment quality quantity sleep chemotherapy , examine effect bright light treatment sleep/wake rhythm chemotherapy . Women breast cancer stage I-III schedule begin chemotherapy recruit . Wrist actigraphy data ( measurement sleep/wake activity ) collect three consecutive day night immediately precede chemotherapy questionnaire data ( fatigue , mood , quality life , functional outcome , sleep ) collect time period . Half woman randomize receive bright light half dim red light control . Daily bright light dim light treatment administer cycle 2 , 3 4 chemotherapy measure ( actigraphy questionnaire ) repeat first last week cycle 1 cycle 4 chemotherapy . If bright light improve sleep rhythm fatigue , quality life woman likely improve .</detailed_description>
