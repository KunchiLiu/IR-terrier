	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response rate recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) . II . To assess frequency prolong stable disease ( defined percentage [ % ] patient alive free progressive disease 6 month ) patient recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer treat sunitinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time-to- progression , median overall survival , rate one-year survival patient recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer treat sunitinib . II . To assess toxicity associate sunitinib patient recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month relapse .</detailed_description>
