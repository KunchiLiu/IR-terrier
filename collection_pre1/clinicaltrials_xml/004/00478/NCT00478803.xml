	<brief_summary>The primary objective CAVIAAR study prove aortic valve spar patient aortic root aneurysm and/or dystrophic aortic insufficiency associate 45 % increase 3 years-survival rate without increase mortality serious increase morbidity event compare mechanical valve replacement . The main hypothesis study standardize procedure valve spar base external aortic annuloplasty patient dystrophic aortic insufficiency and/or aortic root aneurysm increase survival rate without increase mortality serious increase morbidity event compare patient undergo mechanical aortic valve replacement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CAVIAAR trial multicenter , prospective open trial . Target recruitment 260 adult aortic root aneurysm and/or dystrophic aortic insufficiency , enrol 19 french center . Patients undergo standardized aortic valve spar procedure base aortic annuloplasty mechanical valve replacement ( 130 patient arm ) . In case valve sparing , per-operative transoesophageal echocardiography evaluate residual aortic insufficiency valve repair . A conversion towards valve replacement perform residual aortic insufficiency superior equal grade II . Analysis intention-to-treat basis , complete per-protocol analysis . Primary endpoint 3-years survival free morbidity mortality , evaluate composite criterion , associate mortality ; structural non-structural valvular dysfunction , valve thrombosis , embolism , bleed event , endocarditis , reoperations permanent valve-related impairment . In valve spar group , expect less 5 % rate operative conversion significant improvement primary endpoint . As secondary goal , quality life criterion valvular coaptation compare 2 group . Standardization prerequisite evaluation valve spar procedure . Aim CAVIAAR trial provide evidence base medicine data best surgical management patient aortic root aneurysm and/or dystrophic aortic insufficiency .</detailed_description>
