	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Sorafenib Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) account approximately 3 % cancer . RCC cure diagnose treat still localize kidney immediate surround tissue . Since RCC tumour diagnose still localize , approximately 40 % patient survive 5 year . The median survival Stage IV RCC diagnosis 8 12 month 5-year survival le 10 % . Surgery primary therapy RCC century . Until recently , metastatic disease refractory systemic therapy . Despite recent advance immunotherapy ( e.g . Interferon Interleukin-2 ) , response rate remain low ( 15 % ) patient experience durable remission . Surgical radiation therapy Stage IV disease generally limited palliation symptom . For majority patient , metastatic RCC incurable patient consider candidate clinical trial appropriate . In summary , available therapy advance unresectable and/or metastatic RCC limit clinical value , response rate range 6-20 % little impact natural history disease . Furthermore , toxicity associate agent severe , require careful patient selection , dramatically decrease number patient may benefit therapy . Advanced RCC remain incurable need effective therapy high . This non-randomized , open-label treatment protocol patient advance RCC . Patients treat 400 mg oral sorafenib twice day continuous . Patients protocol may continue treated sorafenib single agent follow criterion drug protocol discontinuation reach : 1 . Progression disease . 2 . The patient unlikely benefit treatment sorafenib judge Investigator . 3 . Intolerable toxicity drug . 4 . Withdrawal consent reason .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent prior receive sorafenib . 2 . At least 18 year age . 3 . Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma . 4 . A patient receive prior systemic local therapy , must completely recover acute toxicity ( i.e . resolve back CTCAE Grade 1 less ) . 5 . For patient , major surgery injury , wound must completely heal prior receive sorafenib treatment ( 4 week ) . 6 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Men must use adequate birth control least 3 month last administration sorafenib . Should woman become pregnant participate partner patient participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 1 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . 2 . Patients metastatic brain meningeal tumour . 3 . Cardiac disease : great NYHA functional class II ; unstable CAD ; MI within last 6 month . 4 . HIV infection chronic hepatitis B C ; patient ChildPugh class C hepatic impairment . 5 . Patients severe renal impairment ( calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min ) require dialysis . 6 . Patients active uncontrolled hypertension . 7 . Patients recent active bleeding diathesis . 8 . Patients medical condition could jeopardize safety take investigational drug . 9 . Excluded therapy medication , previous concomitant : Bone marrow transplant stem cell rescue within 4 month study entry . Anticipation need major surgery course study . CYP 3A4 inducer ( e.g . rifampicin , St. John 's Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ] , phenytoin , phenobarbital dexamethasone ) . 10 . Any investigational therapy protocol within 30 day prior first dose sorafenib . Any drug ( license investigational ) target angiogenesis , especially VEGF VEGFReceptors ( e.g . bevacizumab ) . Any drug ( licensed investigational ) target Raspathway EGFR . Biological response modifier , GCSF GMCSF , within 3 week prior study entry study ( GCSF hematopoietic growth factor may use management acute toxicity febrile neutropenia , medically indicate discretion Investigator ) . Use Megestrolacetate medroxyprogesterone . Patients take narrow therapeutic index medication monitor closely . These include warfarin , phenytoin , quinidine , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , cyclosporine digoxin .</criteria>
