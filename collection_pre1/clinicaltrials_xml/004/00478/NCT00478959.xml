	<brief_title>Phase II Study Lenalidomide Treatment Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While result primary therapy Hodgkin 's lymphoma generally excellent , 10-20 % patient advanced stage disease enter complete remission ( CR ) 20-30 % patient relapse completion treatment . Salvage chemotherapy follow high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) become treatment choice patient relapse initially chemotherapy-refractory disease . Although high dose chemotherapy remain curative option treatment relapse chemotherapy-refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma , 50 % patient ultimately recur post-stem cell transplant require treatment . Thalidomide agent anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory anti-angiogenic property . Thalidomide show activity number solid hematologic malignancy , demonstrate effectiveness treatment refractory multiple myeloma . A dose escalation study single-agent thalidomide perform heavily pre-treated patient two Hodgkin 's patient enrol respond treatment . Based NCI experience vinblastine , initiate phase II trial examine combination thalidomide vinblastine patient treat palliatively Hodgkin 's lymphoma . In heavily pre-treated group patient ( 70 % case relapse post-ASCT ) , response rate 40 % combination note median duration response nine month . Lenalidomide ( RevlimidÂ® ) thalidomide derivative first-in-class novel immunomodulatory agent potent activity well favourable toxicity profile parent compound . Based alteration demonstrate various cytokine angiogenic marker patient Hodgkin 's lymphoma , feel Lenalidomide 's immunomodulatory anti-angiogenic effect make ideal drug study lymphoma . This first study assess Lenalidomide patient Hodgkin 's lymphoma.This single arm , open-label phase II multi-centre study evaluate single agent activity Lenalidomide relapse refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma . The primary endpoint objective response rate ( CR + CRu + PR ) determine International Workshop Criteria . Initial treatment consist lenalidomide 25 mg PO daily give 21 consecutive day ( day 1 - 21 ) , seven day 28 day cycle.Patients PR , CR CRu , may continue therapy 2 cycle past best response.Patients PD time evidence SD cycle 4 monotherapy eligible receive treatment dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily day 1 - 4 15 - 18 28 day cycle continue protocol treatment continue meet criterion continuation therapy .</detailed_description>
