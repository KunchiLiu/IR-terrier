	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate safety MVA85A healthy volunteer Cape Town . We show MVA85A safe immunogenic mycobacterially naïve population UK mycobacterially expose population The Gambia . The study describe assess safety MVA85A 2 group adult , without prior BCG vaccination . Once safety data obtain 2 group , assess safety MVA85A adolescents previously vaccinate BCG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity MVA85A , Healthy Volunteers Cape Town</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label Phase I safety study single intradermal injection 5 x 107pfu MVA85A , administer healthy subject evidence infection M.tb Sample size : This observational descriptive safety study , 12 subject evidence prior BCG vaccination 12 adult evidence prior BCG vaccination recruit vaccinated MVA85A . This sample size allow determination magnitude outcome measure , especially serious severe adverse event rather aim obtain statistical significance . Once three month follow-up two arm study complete , recruit 12 adolescent school child ( age 12-14 ) ass safety immunogenicity single immunisation MVA85A group . Rules progression adult study adolescent : 1 . No increased incidence local systemic side-effects compare trial MVA85A Oxford The Gambia . In trial UK The Gambia , volunteer experience mild local side-effects 1-4 day vaccination . Approximately two- third volunteer experience mild systemic side-effects first 24 hour vaccination . These self-limiting spontaneously resolve . These side-effects consistent data use recombinant MVAs expressing antigen ( Moorthy VS et al , 2003 ) . 2 . Immune responses measure 1 week vaccination . We see strong immune response 1 week vaccination Oxford Gambian volunteer ( McShane et al , 2004 ) . We know long response South African volunteer last , would expect see induction significant ( compare baseline ) immune response measure ex-vivo Elispot assay , 1 week vaccination</detailed_description>
