	<detailed_description>Patients receive lacidipine 4mg amlodipine 5mg initial 4 week . If SBP less 140mmHg Week 4 , subject continue take lacidipine 4mg amlodipine 5mg . If SBP ≥140mmHg Week 4 , dose lacidipine increase 6mg amlodipine increase 10mg . If BP control 140mmHg Week 8 , diuretic add . For 12 week treatment period , subject visit clinic every 4 week</detailed_description>
