	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , ketoconazole , may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Lenalidomide may stop growth prostate cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving ketoconazole hydrocortisone together lenalidomide may effective treatment prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give ketoconazole hydrocortisone together lenalidomide work treat patient prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response frequency patient hormone-refractory progressive prostate cancer treat ketoconazole , hydrocortisone , lenalidomide . Secondary - Determine effect regimen time clinical progression patient . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Determine effect regimen serum cytokine , include tumor necrosis factor-alpha , basic fibroblast growth factor , plasma soluble interleukin ( IL ) -2 receptor , IL-8 , IL-12 , well serum vascular endothelial growth factor level patient . - Determine co-stimulatory effect regimen dendritic cell CD4-positive , CD25-positive , T-regulatory cell patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label study . Patients receive oral ketoconazole 3 time daily oral hydrocortisone twice daily day 1-28 oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection periodically study evaluation prostate cancer-specific immune response . Blood sample assess serum analysis , flow cytometry , real-time PCR , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique detect quantify different cytokine , antiangiogenic marker , dendritic cell , specific T-regulatory cell . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 34 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER PROGRESSIVE AFTER ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION Inclusion Criteria Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form . Age 18 year time signing informed consent form . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Testosterone le 50 ng/dL . Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation LHRH analogue undergone orchiectomy . All previous cancer therapy , include radiation , surgery , must discontinue least 4 week prior receive first dose study drug . Progressive disease androgen deprivation . Exclusion Criteria Prior systemic chemotherapy hormone refractory prostate cancer . Prior neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy allow complete least 12 month prior enrollment . Prior ketoconazole , aminoglutethimide corticosteroid treatment progressive prostate cancer . Prior immunotherapy include , limited , vaccine , Thalidomide , Lenalidomide like agent . Supplements complementary medicines/botanicals permit protocol therapy , except combination follow : conventional multivitamin supplement selenium lycopene soy supplement Patients review label doctor prior enrollment , discontinue disallow agent prior study enrollment Serious intercurrent infection nonmalignant medical illness include autoimmune disorder uncontrolled .

Patients take astemizole , terfenadine , cisapride , rifampin isoniazid eligible , unless agree completely discontinue agent . In case , agent discontinue least 7 day prior start therapy Ketoconazole . Use experimental drug therapy within 28 day baseline . Known hypersensitivity thalidomide analogue . Any prior use Lenalidomide . Known positive HIV infectious hepatitis , type A , B C. Disease free prior malignancy 5 year exception currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` insitu '' breast .</criteria>
