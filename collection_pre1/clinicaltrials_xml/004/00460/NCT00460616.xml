	<brief_summary>Dopamine agonists first-line agent treatment prolactinomas ( 1 ) Parkinson 's disease ( 2 ) . There evidence support causal relationship occurrence drug-induced `` restrictive '' valvular heart disease treatment pergolide ( 3 ) : several case , valvulopathy improve pergolide discontinue ( 4 ) . Valvular heart damage also report ergot-derived dopamine agonist bromocriptine cabergoline ( 5,6 ) . Two recent study ( 7,8 ) demonstrate pergolide cabergoline associate increase risk new cardiac valve regurgitation patient treat Parkinson 's disease . The valvular abnormality see ergot-derived dopamine agonist similar observe patient receive ergot alkaloid agent ( ergotamine methysergide ) treatment migraine , fenfluramine dexfenfluramine treatment obesity . These abnormality also closely resemble carcinoid-related valvulopathies ( 9 ) . Cardiac valve disease never report patient prolactinomas require treatment dopamine-agonists even life-long ( 1 ) . At variance patient Parkinson 's disease , patient prolactinomas young treated average dose dopamine-agonists significantly low ( median bromocriptine dose 5 mg/day median cabergoline dose 1 mg/week ) . Because young age treatment beginning ( patient microprolactinomas start dopamine-agonist treatment early adulthood ) , treatment might continue 3 decade : cumulative risk low dos dopamine agonist long period treatment currently unknown . To assess prevalence cardiac valve disease patient treat cabergoline , wish perform echocardiography screen large representative sample patient prolactinoma treated cabergoline least 12 month group control subject recruit prospectively . We wish evaluate severity regurgitation mitral , aortic , tricuspid valve . Changes cardiac valve apparatus compare treatment duration cumulative cabergoline dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Within one week clinical observation outpatient service , patient admit hospital complete endocrine screening , cardiological visit include electrocardiogram echocardiogram . The endocrine profile include measurement IGF-I , PRL , FSH , LH , 17-β-estradiol , testosterone , FT3 , FT4 , TSH , cortisol 8.00 morning overnight fasting . The clinical profile include blood pressure measurement right arm , subject relaxed sit position . The average six measurement ( three take two examiner , day echocardiography , 8.00-9.00 morning ) mercury sphygmomanometer use analysis . According seventh report Joint National Committee Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Pressure ( 10 ) , hypertension , present , classified mild ( Stage 1 ) SBP DBP 140 159 mmHg 90 99 mmHg , respectively ; severe ( Stage 2 ) SBP DBP &gt; 160 &gt; 100 mmHg respectively ; pre-hypertension define SBP &gt; 120¬ &lt; 140 DBP &gt; 80 &lt; 90 mmHg .
