	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb , distribute , eliminate body ) moxifloxacin alone versus moxifloxacin give rifapentine . Researchers believe understand tuberculosis drug interact give together may help determine best drug treatment plan use future study . Volunteers take moxifloxacin daily mouth first part study moxifloxacin combination rifapentine second part study . Sixteen healthy men woman recruit Johns Hopkins University School Medicine volunteer study . They require stay inpatient unit twice , time 84 hour . Study procedure include tube place vein draw several blood sample time . Volunteers participate study maximum 48 day , include screen follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Issues Moxifloxacin Plus Rifapentine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New drug urgently need shorten duration tuberculosis ( TB ) treatment facilitate delivery directly observe therapy . Preliminary data indicate TB treatment regimen include moxifloxacin plus rifapentine may excellent antituberculosis activity could allow shorten total TB treatment duration . However , little know possible pharmacokinetic interaction two drug human . More specifically , moxifloxacin metabolize via glucuronide sulfate conjugation inactive metabolite . Given rifapentine induces activity phase II enzymes include glucuronosyltransferase sulphotransferase , possible rifapentine may alter pharmacokinetics moxifloxacin . This study prospective , phase I , single center pharmacokinetic study healthy subject . The trial compare pharmacokinetics moxifloxacin alone versus moxifloxacin administer thrice-weekly rifapentine , administer orally . There two part trial : Part I ( Days 1-4 ) moxifloxacin administer alone ; Part II ( Days 5-19 ) moxifloxacin co-administered thrice-weekly rifapentine . A 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile moxifloxacin obtain follow dose administration moxifloxacin Day 4 obtain baseline steady state data dose 400 mg daily . On Day 5 , rifapentine add regimen dose 900 mg thrice weekly , 48-hour pharmacokinetic profile rifapentine metabolite , 25-desacetyl-rifapentine obtain first dose . On Day 19 , 72-hour pharmacokinetic profile moxifloxacin , rifapentine , 25-desacetyl-rifapentine performed . Safety tolerability assessment perform designate interval throughout study . Beginning Day 1 , subject receive moxifloxacin 400 mg daily 19 day ( Days 1-19 ) . Beginning Day 5 , subject also receive rifapentine 900 mg thrice weekly ( administered Days 5 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 16 19 ) . Study participants 16 healthy adult , age 18-65 , recruited Johns Hopkins University School Medicine . The primary study objective : compare , healthy volunteer , pharmacokinetics moxifloxacin alone versus moxifloxacin co-administered thrice-weekly rifapentine describe safety tolerability moxifloxacin co-administered rifapentine . The secondary study objective evaluate rifapentine autoinduction metabolism healthy volunteer receive thrice-weekly rifapentine . The primary safety outcome proportion subject Grade 3 4 toxicity associate study medication serious adverse event . The secondary safety outcome proportion subject Grade 1 2 toxicity associate study medication , proportion subject discontinue study medication reason .</detailed_description>
