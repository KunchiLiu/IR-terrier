	<brief_title>Phase II/III Study Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor ( Kamada-API ) Individuals With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency , also call Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor ( API ) deficiency , genetic disorder characterize production abnormal amount AAT protein reduce circulating level protein . Subjects AAT deficiency increase risk develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . It believe result chronic activity elastase release cell continually present lung low number . This study randomize , double-blind comparison Kamada API , Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor currently market API product .</detailed_description>
