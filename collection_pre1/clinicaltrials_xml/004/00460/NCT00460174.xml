	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop tumor growth block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Gemcitabine bevacizumab may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving gemcitabine together bevacizumab radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together bevacizumab abdominal radiation therapy work treat patient localize pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response rate patient treat concurrent bevacizumab , gemcitabine hydrochloride , abdominal radiotherapy . Secondary - Determine quantitative toxicity associate delivery regimen patient . - Determine 1-year median survival patient treat regimen . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine pattern recurrence entire population patient treat regimen subgroup resect cure . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Evaluate surgical experience patient undergo surgical resection completion protocol-directed therapy . - Evaluate toxicity associate surgical resection patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 course 1 3 day 1 , 8 , 15 course 2 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 course 1 , day 8 22 course 2 , day 8 course 3 . Treatment repeat every 3-4 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 1 second course chemotherapy , patient undergo concurrent abdominal radiotherapy daily , five day week , 3 week . Patients evaluate week 10 . Patients whose disease deem resectable study treatment undergo standard pancreatic resection least 6 week completion bevacizumab . Patients remain unresectable progressed completion chemoradiotherapy may begin maintenance therapy comprise gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride bevacizumab repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
