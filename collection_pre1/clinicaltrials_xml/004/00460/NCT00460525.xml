	<brief_summary>Malaria disease affect many people Africa . Malaria cause germ spread mosquito bite . The purpose study compare number child get malaria receive experimental malaria vaccine ( FMP2.1/AS02A ) number child get malaria receive vaccine rabies ( approve vaccine prevent malaria ) . The child assign one vaccine group chance . Participants doctor know vaccine give . Study participant include 400 child , age 1-6 year , live Bandiagara , Mali . Children receive 3 vaccine dos , injection , upper arm . Study procedure include physical exam several blood sample . Participants involve study 26 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II AMA-1 Malaria Vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A Trial Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , phase II clinical trial evaluate efficacy , safety immunogenicity apical membrane antigen-1 Plasmodium ( P. ) falciparum ( AMA-1 ) malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A use rabies vaccine control healthy child 1-6 year old Bandiagara , Mali . This study link DMID protocol 05-0146 , phase I dose escalation trial site population . In study , 400 subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive either 50 microgram FMP2.1 0.5 mL AS02A rabies vaccine . Immunizations give day 0 , 30 60 . Solicited adverse event record day immunization 1 , 2 , 3 7 day immunization . Unsolicited adverse event record 30 day immunization . Passive case detection use capture clinical malaria episodes adverse event include serious adverse event , occur continuous availability clinical care population high utilization care . Active surveillance use capture malaria infection adverse event include serious adverse event . For active case detection , follow third dose , participant follow monthly 6 month 12 , 18 24 month randomization , clinical assessment , malaria smear hemoglobin . Routine monthly malaria smear read immediately unless symptom present . Children follow 2 year first immunization . Sera collect anti-FMP2.1 antibody titer day immunization 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 24 month first immunization . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) collect day immunization , 30 day third immunization 8 , 12 , 18 24 month first immunization . The study Final Report base data collect 6 month assign date third immunization . A supplemental report include data entire 24-month observation period . Primary study objective : determine efficacy FMP2.1/AS02A child age 1-6 year first clinical malaria episode ( axillary temperature great equal 37.5 degree Celsius parasitemia great equal 2500/mm^3 ) occur randomization 6 month assign date third immunization ; ass safety vaccine child age 1-6 year . Secondary study objective : describe dynamic anti-AMA-1 antibody responses recipient malaria vaccine compare natural response control group ; determine whether serum anti-AMA-1 IgG titer enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) 1 month third immunization correlate protection clinical malaria episode ; measure allele-specific efficacy parasites AMA-1 genotype homologous heterologous 3D7 clone P. falciparum ; determine vaccine efficacy clinical malaria episodes occur randomization 6 month assign date third immunization ; efficacy observe base primary endpoint , determine vaccine efficacy first clinical malaria episode clinical episode ( use increase parasitemia threshold ) occur 2 year randomization .</detailed_description>
