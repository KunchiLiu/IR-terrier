	<brief_summary>SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause late onset visual impairment legal blindness people 65 year age old United States . It heterogeneous clinical entity retinal degeneration occur predominantly macula context age lead impairment primarily central visual acuity . The degenerative retinal eye disease occur two form - non-exudative `` dry '' form exudative `` wet '' form individual patient may also represent stage disease . Non-exudative AMD account 80-90 % AMD case involve constellation clinical feature include drusen , pigment clump and/or retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) dropout , geographic atrophy . Because overwhelming number `` dry '' AMD subject , cumulative impact vision loss significant . There effective therapy maintain improve vision associate dry AMD . The therapy person dry AMD oral supplement contain high dos antioxidant zinc , test National Eye Institute large , multi-center , double-masked , sham-controlled clinical trial1 . This antioxidant therapy show modestly retard progression dry AMD intermediate stage advance stage confirm benefit antioxidant therapy disease . There currently FDA-approved therapy treatment subject dry AMD . Recently , MIRA-1 modify per protocol population show effectiveness Rheopheresis application selective therapeutic apheresis , namely double filtration plasmapheresis ( DFPP ) use specifically design filter plasma filtration subject non-exudative AMD . At one year study report statistical significance ( 1 ) approximately one line vision improvement Rheopheresis group versus change Sham group ( 2 ) 28 % subject randomize active treatment gain least one line vision versus 9 % subject randomize sham treatment . With total 300 subject dry AMD visual acuity 20/40-20/100 inclusive , current investigation plan prove effectiveness Rheopheresis treatment large scale . Each subject receive series 8 treatment ( either active treatment sham treatment 2:1 ratio ) period approximately 2.5 month . In addition , post-treatment ophthalmic evaluation perform 2 week 8th treatment ( approximately 3 month baseline visit ) 6 , 9 12 month visit . Comparing one-year proportion least 10-letter gain ETDRS LogMar BCVA baseline , current investigation show effectiveness Rheopheresis treatment ( compare sham treatment ) treat dry AMD subject . Other secondary effectiveness endpoint , include mean change proportion BCVA well 20/40 one year , analyze support main investigation .</brief_summary>
