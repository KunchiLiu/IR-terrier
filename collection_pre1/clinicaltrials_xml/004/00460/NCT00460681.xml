	<brief_title>Study Thymopentin Patients After Curative Resection Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one prevalent malignancy China , approximately 90 % patient HCC also infect hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) .Chronic HBV infection lead cause liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . Surgical resection provide potentially curative outcome patient indicated procedure ; however , survival far satisfactory high recurrence rate , approximately 38-65 % first 5 years， even small HCC resection , still high 43.5 % ，and contribute major cause mortality . Several approach report decrease recurrence rate curative resection HCC , postoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , chemotherapy , cyclic retinoic acid , adoptive immunotherapy . However , approach either controversial require evaluation , substantial need novel treatment require urgently . Tumor-induced immuno-suppression lead imbalance within immune system , closely related HCC recurrence metastasis resection , effective response need eliminate residual tumor cell removal major tumor tissue surgery . Immunomodulatory peptide , like thymopentin ( TP5 ) , may act immunomodulatory agent cancer chemotherapy . TP5 comprise amino acid ( Arg-Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr ) represent residues 32-36 nuclear protein thymopoietin ( TP ) . A multitude vivo study show efficacy TP5 treatment therapy various disease include neoplastic , immune deficiency , autoimmune , recurrent viral disease etc . It rectify imbalance immune system without observable side effect , even high dos . Furthermore , TP5 able significantly inhibit proliferation induce apoptosis type cancer line . Thus TP5 act immunomodulatory factor cancer chemotherapy anti-HBV therapy , also potential chemotherapeutic agent human cancer therapy</detailed_description>
