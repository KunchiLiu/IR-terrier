	<brief_summary>This open mono-centre randomise control trial perform Medical University Graz include treatment visit ( V1 ) . In treatment visit ( V1 ) admittance ICU arterial blood glucose value monitor either software-algorithm eMPC use adjust infusion rate intravenously administer human soluble insulin normalise arterial blood glucose routine treatment use establish tight glycaemic control . The treatment visit last 72 hour . The primary hypothesis study blood glucose control eMPC algorithm inferior compare implemented routine protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperglycaemia commonly find critically ill patient . The stress critical illness induces glucose counterregulatory hormone number alteration carbohydrate metabolism , include increased peripheral glucose demand , enhance hepatic glucose production , insulin resistance relative insulin deficiency . Moreover , clinical intervention , corticoid , vasopressor , enteral parenteral nutrition , predispose patient elevate blood glucose level . In patient intensive care well general hospital setting patient hyperglycemia high mortality rate . Recent study demonstrate tight blood glucose control ICU patient result significant good outcome patient . Based emerge clinical evidence , increase effort world-wide maintain strict glycaemic control critically ill patient . However , achieve goal require extensive nursing effort , include frequent bedside glucose monitoring implementation complex intensive insulin infusion protocol increase work demand may readily accept busy ICU nursing staff . The development close loop control system automatically infuse insulin basis glucose measurement could permit strict glycaemic control improve clinical outcome without increase workload ICU nursing staff . The EU found project CLINICIP ( Closed Loop Infusion Critically ill patient ) aim develop lowâ€“risk monitoring control system allow maintain metabolic control intensive care unit . As first step local bedside semi-closed system develop . Based arterial spot measurement , adaptive control algorithm generate advice thus represent decision support system ICU nursing staff . This control algorithm adapt patient ICU . The first study use algorithm perform Medical University Hospital Graz . In six patient , include feasibility trial , blood glucose level could normalise maintain narrow target range 24 hour without single hypoglycaemic episode . Subsequently , algorithm test multicentric randomize controlled trial setting show superiority mean reduce number hypoglycaemic event higher percentage glucose value within target range compare routine care glucose management protocol . In study fact hourly sampling frequency algorithm group positively influence outcome algorithm group . Therefore enhanced version algorithm ( eMPC ) sample interval expand 240 min . The purpose study evaluate feasibility enhance model predictive control algorithm glycaemic control critically ill patient compare routine treatment .</detailed_description>
