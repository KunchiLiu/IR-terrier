	<detailed_description>This compete continuation proposal follow NR04340 , `` The Effects Hemodialysis Sleep/ Wake Cycle '' , seek test efficacy alter dialysate temperature nocturnal sleep daytime sleepiness patient chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) . During initial funding period , examined effect HD time administration sleep wake . The major finding , comparison group control subject renal failure yet dialysis , HD subject reduce nocturnal total sleep time sleep efficiency increase number brief arousal . One-third HD subject abnormal , objectively measure daytime sleepiness , significant predictor index nocturnal sleep disorder duration HD treatment . These effect occur independent treatment time day . The negative influence daytime sleepiness life quality functioning also find highlight importance development test intervention design address change . Furthermore , recently describe relationship sleep disorders/sleepiness cardiovascular disease lead cause death HD patient underscore importance work . Within context Two-Process Model Sleep Regulation well-described relationship sleep/wake state body temperature ( BT ) , data additional study conduct indicate HD associate heat production contribute iatrogenic effect sleep/wake cycle . Consistent report , show HD cause increase BT , furthermore , alters course across day . We also show BT state sleepiness predictably covary across duration HD HD associate increased level subjective objective measurement sleepiness . From theoretical physiological perspective , one would predict HD-induced change would place patient high-risk sleep/wake disturbance . In fact , nocturnal daytime polysomnographic study conduct initial funding period demonstrate severity sleep/wake problem experience group . Previously test intervention design improve sleep HD patient , normalize hematocrit perform slow , nocturnal HD , decrease periodic limb movement sleep apnea respectively , fail significantly improve index nocturnal sleep quality . We thus conduct pilot study test hypothesis treatment induce change BT contribute fragment nocturnal sleep see group use cool dialysate ( exist intervention use reduce hypotension ) block heat production stabilize sleep/wake cycle . Preliminary result demonstrate , one treatment , intervention markedly normalize rhythm BT improve index nocturnal sleep quantity quality . Therefore , major component proposal test novel application safe , non-pharmacologic , cost-effective intervention already use clinical practice - use cool dialysate HD help stabilize sleep/wake cycle chronic HD patient . We also evaluate effect select sleep-related physiologic , psychological , behavioral , general health outcome . This study , randomize , single-blinded , control group clinical trial , represent logical progression program research devote development intervention design optimize sleep/wake pattern patient chronic HD . The specific aim associate hypothesis : 1 . To test effect use cool dialysate HD comparison warm dialysate ( standard treatment ) sleep/wake cycle patient chronic renal failure . H1 HD subject improved nocturnal sleep ( objective subjective measure sleep latency , total sleep time , sleep efficiency , sleep disturbance ) dialyze cool dialysate comparison warm dialysate . H2 HD subject decrease daytime sleepiness ( physiologic , manifest , introspective ) dialyze cool dialysate comparison warm dialysate . 2 . To test effect use cool dialysate HD comparison warm dialysate sleep-related physiological , psychological , behavioral , general health outcome . H3 HD subject demonstrate improvement select sleep-related physiological ( distal/proximal skin gradient axillary body temperature rhythm ) , psychological ( mood ) , behavioral ( daily rest/activity ) , general health outcome ( quality life functional status ) dialyze cool dialysate comparison warm dialysate .</detailed_description>
