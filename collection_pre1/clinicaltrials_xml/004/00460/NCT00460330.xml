	<brief_title>Evaluate Three Methods Diagnosis Invasive Fungal Infection Chinese Patients After HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive fungal infection one major complication HSCT recipient , incidence increase rapidly recent year . IFI also commonly occur Chinese HSCT recipient , formal report mortality morbidity IFI Chinese patient , study could supply data . Galactomannan ( GM ) cell wall component aspergillus , release blood stream aspergillus grows . While β-D-glucan ( BG ) fungal cell wall , high level BG body fluid also evidence fungal infection . In study , serum level GM BG would detect commercial available kit . We assess cut-off value GM/G test proven/probable IFI patient negative control . Then , could calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predict value GM/G test . Meanwhile , may find genus fungus comparison two method . For example , positive GM G-test may suggest pathogen Aspergillus , positive G-test negative GM-test implies Candida may pathogen . RT-PCR also helpful method IFI diagnosis , sensitive GM G-test encompass multiple fungal genus . The small-subunit rRNA gene sequence relatively conserve among member fungal kingdom , include Aspergillus Candida specie , dimorphic fungi , agent zygomycosis , Pneumocystis . So amplify part DNA use gene specific probe detect whether sample positive fungus . Until , report real-time PCR assay diagnosis IFI Chinese HSCT recipient , want carry study . At time , result real-time PCR assay could help u estimate coincidence GM G-test IFI patient . After perform three diagnostic test , could identify HSCT recipient whether IFI accurately , could evaluate antifungal therapy find risk factor IFI patient accurately .</detailed_description>
