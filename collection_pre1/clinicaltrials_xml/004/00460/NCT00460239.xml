	<brief_summary>This residential study look effect buprenorphine person abuse dependent opioids . Animal study show high dos buprenorphine produce less effect mid-range dos . This suggest buprenorphine safe medication . However , study human test high dos similar way . The goal study show effect single dos buprenorphine , across range dos , person physically dependent opioids ( abuse opioids ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buprenorphine 's Dose Response Curve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical study demonstrate variety measure buprenorphine bell-shaped dose response curve . However , human study buprenorphine show effect , although control study generally test high acute dos buprenorphine . Current clinical recommendation generally place upper limit daily buprenorphine dose 32 mg sublingual tablet , although considerably high acute dos administer human ( primarily clinical study less daily dose ) . Determining relationship high dos buprenorphine human effect produce would valuable ; would scientifically interesting demonstrate bell-shaped curve human , would help guide clinical practice ( example , respect dosing , safety , side effect consideration . The purpose study characterize dose response curve buprenorphine human , utilize acute single dos parenteral buprenorphine .</detailed_description>
