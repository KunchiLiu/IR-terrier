	<brief_summary>Cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cell show lab cytolytic autologous allogeneic acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell . Large scale expansion CIK cell also show feasible healthy allogeneic stem cell donor well patient undergo mobilization autologous transplant . Donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) show active haematological malignancy include CML , AML , MDS , NHL Hodgkin 's disease . These donor lymphocyte activate vitro become CIK cell . At least 2 center world give allogeneic CIK cell patient relapse post allogeneic transplant variety haematological malignancy . These early report demonstrate feasibility , absence increase GVHD possible efficacy case . We propose Phase I /II study feasibility / efficacy immunotherapy allogeneic CIK cell patient relapse allogeneic marrow transplant haematological malignancy . These patient either refractory conventional donor lymphocyte infusion , need large number donor lymphocyte could provide unmanipulated donor lymphocyte . Donor lymphocytes collect cultured GMP facility maturity , infused patient . This give grade dos 4 weekly interval continue absence GVHD till remission achieve disease progression occur . Patients may receive various form chemotherapy appropriate clinical condition case allogeneic CIK infusion . Efficacy assess compare response allogeneic CIK infusion v due conventional DLI , ie response two different treatment use DLI response comparator . We expect 10 case do next 3 year . Significant statistic unlikely generate observation description response generate useful information presence efficacy treatment . If clinical efficacy superiority conventional DLI demonstrate , future allogeneic CIK may take place DLI group poor prognosis patient relapse allogeneic transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Patient inclusion criterion This trial include patient relapse allogeneic transplant , either 1.1 No response conventional DLI give least one dose , 1.2 No possibility access large number donor lymphocyte repeat dos DLI , This apply case unrelated transplant cord blood transplant 1,3 Patients develop significant GVHD conventional DLI , therapeutic option . In case rationale base mouse study mismatch CIK produce much less GVHD mismatch unmanipulated splenocytes . 2 . Collection peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) Sibling allogeneic donor routinely PBSC harvest purpose infusion recipient . Currently practice involve one additional day collection freeze backup use DLI event relapse . This collection frozen aliquot , available CIK culture need arises For cord blood transplant , one issue DLI available . There one report grow CIK residual cell bag cord blood infusion , store frozen use future need arises . This anyway compromise cord blood infusion . Similarly do case unrelated donor transplant . This serve backup event donor available repeat collection lymphocyte . 3 . Culture CIK cell For culture frozen product , rapidly thaw culture start gas permeable bag complete medium cytokine detail SOP attach ( appendix 1 ) . Culture medium cytokine add periodically till maturation CIK 21-28 day . For culture residual cell thaw cord blood infusion bag , cell may need undergo ficoll remove rbc , start culture similar way 3 . Harvesting CIK cell At maturity D21-D28 , bag CIK cell pool washed use COBE 2991 cell harvester . This ensure removal &gt; 99.9 % original culture medium . Cells frozen aliquot send quality control ensure compliance GMP standard . This include bacteriological fungal culture , mycoplasma endotoxin test . 4 . Infusion CIK cell Patients may undergo cytoreductive chemotherapy oral immunosuppressive therapy deem fit individual case attend physician . At nadir lymphopenia , CIK cell rapidly thaw bedside infuse . Dose schedule CIK cell follow follow principle 4.1 First dose patient already receive DLI show resistance : double triple last DLI dose ( express CD3/kg ) . 4.2 First dose patient receive DLI : follow conventional practice DLI first dose 10 million CD3/kg . 4.3 Subsequent dos give 4-weekly interval allow time observe development GVHD response . 4.3.1 If response observe , dose double tripled ( depend size available aliquot ) . If good response , dose remain previous infusion . 4.3.2 In presence GVHD , infusion withheld till resolution GVHD , resume half one-third previous dose ( depend size available aliquot ) . 4.4 Duration CIK infusion depend response status 4.4.1 In respond patient , 4-weekly CIK infusion continue till complete remission achieve another 2-3 infusion beyond . 4.4.2 In patient achieve stable partial response , CIK infusion continue 4-weekly interval , provide adverse effect CIK cell available . This continue stop disease break . 4.4.3 In patient disease continue progress 2-3 cycle CIK infusion , infusion give</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This trial include patient relapse allogeneic transplant , either : 1 . No response conventional DLI give least one dose , 2 . No possibility access large number donor lymphocyte repeat dos DLI , This apply case unrelated transplant cord blood transplant 3 . Patients develop significant GVHD conventional DLI , therapeutic option . In case rationale base mouse study mismatch CIK produce much less GVHD mismatch unmanipulated splenocytes . In view period take culture cell maturity , patient must life expectancy one month . Interim measure eg chemotherapy conventional DLI give interval ongoing treatment compromised way . 1 . Uncontrolled infection significant bleed 2 . Unstable vital sign 3 . Any degree hypoxia require oxygen therapy .</criteria>
