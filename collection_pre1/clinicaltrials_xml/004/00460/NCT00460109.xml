	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Combinations biological substance denileukin diftitox may able carry cancer-killing substance directly cancer cell . Giving rituximab together denileukin diftitox may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give rituximab together denileukin diftitox work treat patient previously untreated stage III stage IV follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Denileukin Diftitox Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage III Stage IV Follicular B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate ( complete response [ CR ] , unconfirmed CR , partial response ) patient previously untreated stage III IV follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat rituximab denileukin diftitox . - Assess overall survival , time-to-progression , duration response , time-to-new therapy patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine whether regimen deplete inhibits function regulatory T cell patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients also receive denileukin diftitox IV 15-60 minute day 1-5 . Treatment denileukin diftitox repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect baseline ; day 1 course 2-4 ; 1 4 month completion study treatment research study . Research study include analysis peripheral blood lymphocyte subset express CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD19 , CD25 , CD26 flow cytometry ; quantitation CD4+ , CD25+ regulatory T cell flow cytometry ; tumor-specific γ-interferon-secreting T cell enzyme-linked immunospot assay ; tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity ; immune activation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year registration . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 53 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
