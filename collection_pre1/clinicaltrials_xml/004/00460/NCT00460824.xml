	<brief_summary>Transplant rejection follow organ transplant occur recipient 's immune system attack transplant organ . The recipient immune system recognize transplant organ foreign tissue attempt destroy similar way attempt destroy infectious agent bacteria virus . The human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) system set gene responsible control individual ' ability tell difference infectious agent self tissue . Differences HLA gene donor recipient play major part influence rejection acceptance foreign tissue ( i.e . transplanted organ ) . Due time limitation heart transplantation , HLA match consider . It unclear individual HLA difference affect recovery expect lifespan pediatric heart transplant recipient . This study design look donor-recipient matching mismatch determine mismatch leads complication , short graft survival , therefore , increase risk death follow pediatric heart transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Retrospective Review - Anti-HLA Antibodies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It generally think immunologic mismatching solid organ transplant lead increase rate graft failure due acute rejection short term chronic rejection , coronary vasculopathy longterm . Many study renal , pancreas lung transplantation suggest favorable outcome HLA match occurs unfavorable outcome HLA mismatching occur circulate donor-specific antibody produce . However , heart transplantation association less clear . Advances recognition identification HLA antibody result specific information regard HLA mismatch outcomes . This study aim analyze outcomes pediatric heart transplant base recipient-donor HLA incompatibility post-transplant production donor-specific HLA antibody . Hypothesis : 1 . HLA system ' gene class I &amp; II matching result survival/rejection benefit pediatric heart transplant recipient . 2 . Mismatched transplant donor-specific HLA antibody decrease overall survival . A Multivariate Analysis data perform Emory Children 's investigator research support staff .</detailed_description>
