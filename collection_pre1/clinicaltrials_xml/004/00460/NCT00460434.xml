	<brief_title>Outcomes Following Vaginal Prolapse Repair Mid Urethral Sling Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective randomize clinical trial determine whether symptom-specific treatment incontinence prolapse surgery equally effective prophylactic treatment add TVT® time prolapse surgery among woman anterior vaginal prolapse without pre-operative symptom stress urinary incontinence . The primary aim : In stress continent woman plan vaginal surgery pelvic organ prolapse : 1 . To determine failure rate define subsequent treatment urinary incontinence , sign symptoms bothersome urinary incontinence ( define least moderate bother 4 PFDI incontinence item ) differs vaginal prolapse repair vaginal prolapse repair plus TVT® first 3 month index surgery . 2 . To determine prevalence bothersome urinary incontinence 12 month index surgery differs vaginal prolapse repair vaginal prolapse repair plus TVT® , whether subsequent treatment symptom urinary incontinence ; i.e. , determine whether symptom-specific treatment incontinence prolapse surgery equally effective prophylactic treatment add TVT® time prolapse surgery . 3 . To measure total cost care relate difference cost care two group difference health utility health-related quality life , allow u examine cost-effectiveness prophylactic use TVT® time prolapse surgery versus symptom-specific treatment stress incontinence prolapse surgery .</detailed_description>
