	<brief_title>Effect Coca-Cola Iron Absorption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study suggest Coca-Cola may enhance absorption non-haem iron . A randomized cross-over trial undertaken compare absorption iron add pizza meal consume either Coca-Cola , Diet Coke mineral water . Pizza contain add iron , label iron stable isotope ( Fe-58 ) , consume lunch two consecutive day either Coca-Cola , Diet Coke mineral water drink . Iron absorption pizza determine use erythrocyte incorporation technique . A baseline blood sample take prior consume first test meal ( pizza + drink 1 ) approximately 15 day , second fasting blood sample take prior consumption second set test meal ( pizza + drink 2 ) . Iron isotope enrichment blood sample use baseline second set test meal calculate absorption first set test meal . A third blood sample take approximately 30 day iron isotope enrichment use baseline third set test meal ( pizza + drink 3 ) determine absorption second set test meal . At 45 day final blood sample take determine absorption third set test meal . Iron absorption calculate isotopic enrichment blood , assume 80 % absorb iron incorporate red blood cell . Absorption iron consume Coca-Cola Diet Coke compare iron absorption consume mineral water . The order volunteer give drink randomise .</detailed_description>
