	<brief_title>Natural History Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AME rare genetic disorder cause mutate HSD11B2 gene , encode metabolic enzyme 11BHSD2 . The altered gene interferes ability 11BHSD2 inactivate hormone cortisol . Above-normal cortisol activity lead rise blood pressure reduction potassium blood . It also lead low level enzyme renin hormone aldosterone , involve regulation long-term blood pressure . Long-term high blood pressure metabolic defect start early age child severe AME . In others , AME may start late life cause less serious side effect . Symptoms include poor growth childhood , delay puberty , muscle weakness , heart rate irregularity , frequent urination , thirst . If leave untreated , AME cause serious damage eye , kidney , heart , organ . Current treatment synthetic steroid spironolactone usually improve symptom ; however , despite treatment , individual AME still experience disease progression even death within year diagnose AME . Understanding AME , progress , affect people differently may help improve treatment option . The purpose study examine genetic basis , natural history , disease progression , outcome child adult AME . The study also examine family member study participant AME genetic abnormality possible mild form AME . This study last 2 7 year . Participants family member attend yearly study visit include interview medical history , symptom , hospital stay ; physical exam ; blood pressure test ; blood urine collection . Interim review medical record occur necessary . Children undergo x-ray leave hand . During initial study visit , participant ask question family member birth size .</detailed_description>
