	<brief_summary>The present study relate new approach coronary artery coronary artery by-pass graft imaging , particularly compute tomographic angiography follow aortic root injection low amount contrast ( 30 cc ) via percutaneously place catheter ( Vanguard DX , Medrad Inc. ) position aortic root . The objective study show feasibility Coronary artery CTA use aortic root injection contrast compare standard invasive cardiac catheterization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease remain leading cause death worldwide . The diagnosis via gold standard , cardiac catheterization , remain time consuming , expensive , invasive procedure considerable risk . In addition , significant risk due cumulative amount iodinate contrast deliver ( 80 - 120 cc ) patient abnormal renal insufficiency high risk develop contrast nephropathy . Cardiac catheterization specifically involve arterial puncture needle , usually groin upper extremity , guidewire pass fluoroscopically ascend aorta . A catheter insert guidewire subsequently , guidewire remove iodinated contrast inject opacify aorta coronary artery . As , different kind catheter use engage either right leave native coronary artery by-pass vein graft . This procedure require separate injection coronary artery by-pass graft induce arrhythmia , require one hour procedural time , require large bore catheter , expose physician patient ionize radiation subject patient coronary artery disease contrast induce nephropathy , especially case require high load iodinate contrast . Of noninvasive technique , common limit factor employ IV-enhanced CTA underlie blood pool , also enhance contrast-enhanced protocol employ use peripheral intravenous contrast injection route . This result frequent obscuration native coronary artery . Reproducible enhancement distal tributary anatomy another pitfall IV-enhanced coronary CTA . In addition , amount contrast agent require similar amount require invasive coronary angiography . As , method present study provide image concept coronary artery employ catheter device conjunction compute tomography ( CT ) image machine enable reduction total amount dye deliver patient .</detailed_description>
