	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine overall survival , include median survival , patient metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas treat dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect drug quantity circulate tumor cell patient . II . Determine time progression patient treat drug . III . Determine pre- post-drug fat-free mass gait speed patient treat drug . IV . Evaluate toxicity drug patient . V. Evaluate objective response rate patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection baseline day 25-31 . Samples analyze quantification circulate tumor cell . Patients also undergo analysis fat-free mass gait speed baseline 1 , 2 , 6 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
