	<brief_title>Study To Evaluate Beta Cell Function Glycemic Outcome Intensive Insulin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes associate beta cell dysfunction insulin action diagnosis diabetes . Although relative importance two alteration controversial , grow evidence swing concept hyperglycemia without β-cell dysfunction . Also agreement deterioration glucose tolerance time associate progressive decrease beta cell function . Beside role genetic factor , continuous decline β-cell function affect glucotoxicity generate hyperglycemia lipotoxicity due high fatty acid . A vicious cycle hyperglycemia per se impairs may destroy β-cell . Recently , many report show early intensive glycemic control play role prevention progressive ß-cell function worsen diabetes . Some study show early intensive insulin therapy ( IIT ) achieve near normoglycemia new onset type 2 diabetes give short term long term improvement glycemic control discontinuation insulin . It suggest long term glycemic control associate improvement β-cell function . In unpublished previous pilot study , investigator find early intensive insulin therapy use multiple daily injection ( MDI ) daily twice injection newly diagnose type 2 diabetes significantly improve beta cell function facilitate long term glycemic control . To establish effectiveness intensive insulin therapy long term glycemic control improvement β-cell function , investigator perform randomize control prospective study newly diagnose type 2 diabetes Korea .</detailed_description>
