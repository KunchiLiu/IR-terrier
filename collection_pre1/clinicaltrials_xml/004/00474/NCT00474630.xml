	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Comparing Naltrexone SR/Bupropion SR Placebo Obese Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimal care patient diabetes mellitus include vigorous persistent effort achieve physiologic control blood glucose well often associate condition include hypertension , dyslipidemia excess weight . Pharmacologic intervention treatment obesity type 2 diabetes show significant reduction HbA1c . Two Phase II clinical trial demonstrate combination bupropion SR naltrexone associate great weight loss bupropion SR alone , naltrexone alone , placebo subject uncomplicated obesity . The current study investigate safety efficacy combination naltrexone SR bupropion SR compare placebo obese subject type 2 diabetes mellitus .</detailed_description>
