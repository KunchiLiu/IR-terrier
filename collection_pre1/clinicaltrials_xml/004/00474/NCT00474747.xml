	<brief_title>Fludarabine-Based Conditioning Allogeneic Marrow Transplantation Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Your bone marrow normally produce white cell , red cell , platelet . Once ready , cell release bloodstream . Aplastic anemia blood disorder bone marrow stop work produce cell release bloodstream . If successfully treat , condition almost always lead death , primarily infection bleeding . A bone marrow transplant option doctor believe may cure aplastic anemia . As matched , sibling donor , match , unrelated donor ( i.e . blood relative ) select . Before receive match , unrelated donor marrow transplant , receive medication low dose total body irradiation ( TBI ) kill immune cell body might reject cell donor . This allow body accept donor marrow . This call engraftment . Cyclophosphamide medication use study lower immune system order allow body accept donor marrow cell . If find eligible take part study , give medication TBI bone marrow transplant allow body accept donor 's stem cell . This call conditioning regimen . Before transplant , catheter ( i.e . soft plastic tube ) insert vein collarbone allow medication fluid give . The condition regimen include combination drug use kill cell body may reject donor cell . The drug use study fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , ATG , well low-dose TBI . All participant study receive amount fludarabine , ATG low-dose TBI . You receive fludarabine fifth , fourth , third second day transplant intravenous infusion catheter 30 minute . You receive ATG fourth , third , second day transplant . This give intravenously catheter 4 6 hour . ATG animal product , study doctor may decide use horse rabbit product . Both product similar side effect efficacy . You receive TBI day transplant . Different group patient get different amount cyclophosphamide . You receive cyclophosphamide total either 1 2 day transplant . The number day depend group . You place group test time . Your doctor tell group . Neither doctor choose group . Sometimes may short wait period new patient enter study , discuss doctor wait period may affect . The main purpose study find best dose cyclophosphamide . This mean small group patient treat give dose cyclophosphamide follow closely show new marrow accept body treatment cause unacceptable harm . In early part study , participant receive cyclophosphamide either 3 , 2 , 1 0 day . The doctor conduct study gain experience condition schedule , help narrow number possible dos cyclophosphamide , new participant , may receive . You aware participant receive 3 day cyclophosphamide ( high dose ) suffer severe side effect ( include death ) , therefore , new patient longer place group . You also aware participant receive zero day cyclophosphamide ( low dose ) experience graft rejection ( meaning , body accept new marrow , new cell fail grow ) . Therefore , new participant longer assign group . Participants come transplantation treat either 1 2 day cyclophosphamide . After condition regimen , donor marrow cell give catheter . The cell travel bloodstream reach bone marrow expect make healthy , new blood cell . This step necessary replace diseased marrow high dosage drug give condition regimen may also damage destroy healthy cell bone marrow . Until new cell begin produce healthy blood cell , increase risk bleed develop infection . Following transplant ( least every week roughly 100 day transplant , every 3-6 month 2 year ) , complete medical history physical exam , include measurement height weight . Blood ( 2-4 tablespoon ) urine may collect routine test . You also bone marrow aspiration biopsy 30 100 day transplant every 4-6 month 2 year . You expect take medication cyclosporine ( tacrolimus ) mouth less 6-9 month prevent graft-versus-host disease . You also expect stay transplant center least 3 month transplant . You ask return transplant center regular follow-up care . The standard test do time . You study 2 year . Follow-up transplant last long require care . However , researcher would like keep track medical condition rest life contact doctor provide regular medical care phone mail year . Keeping touch checking condition every year help researcher look long-term effect study transplantation general . It necessary agree follow-up longer 2 year participate study . After 2 year , continue follow transplant doctor , long part study . You take study ( without consent ) several reason . You may take study longer meet study requirement . Ask doctor would like information . You take study need medical treatment allow study , study chair decides would best interest leave study . You may take study intolerable side effect occur . You take study transplant fails take . In case , doctor decide best treatment . You may take study unable follow study instruction keep study appointment . You may also take study study stop Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . This investigational study . All drug medication use study FDA-approved commercially available . Up 94 participant enrol multicenter study . Up 9 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
