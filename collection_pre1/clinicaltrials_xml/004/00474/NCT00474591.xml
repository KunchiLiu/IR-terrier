	<brief_summary>( ) Main Research Question ( ) : What effect fondaparinux coronary graft patency , heart attack , stroke , death patient undergone coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) ? To reliably answer question require large randomised trial . We propose pilot study demonstrate feasibility recruit patient study perform CT angiograms measure graft patency 30 day . ( ii ) Why research important ? Coronary artery bypass surgery make important contribution improve health survival patient advance coronary artery disease still many problem . One 10 patient experience heart attack time surgery , 1 20 experience heart attack , stroke , death hospitalization , 1 4 patient least 1 blocked graft within 1 year surgery . Fondaparinux , relatively new anticoagulant drug , show significantly reduce cardiovascular event death patient suffer recent heart attack . Compared establish anticoagulant therapy acute myocardial infarction , fondaparinux show effective similar low risk bleed . Fondaparinux , unlike commonly use anticoagulant , cause Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , rare condition extremely high morbidity mortality . This drug never study CABG patient . Our pilot study provide key information feasibility help u design perform large definitive study future . ( iii ) What study ? We look blood flow bypass graft , heart attack , stroke , venous thromboembolism death . For safety look bleeding , transfusion , need surgery bleeding . We also perform laboratory test HIT antibody level prognostic development HIT also relate morbidity mortality . The incidence actual HIT case also record .</brief_summary>
