	<brief_summary>This study examine brain rewires make lack movement many people stroke experience . It try determine rewire differs depend location stroke amount time since stroke occur . For stoke patient , weakness may persist , others recover completely time . It known part brain involved recovery different type stroke type stroke affect recovery . People 18 year age old subacute thromboembolic hemorrhagic stroke 3 month enrol may participate study . Participants come NIH Clinical Center three time every 2 year 10 year . At first visit , patient neurological examination perform test motor ability lift small object , turn card , use spoon , stack checker lift can short period time rapidly possible . At second visit , subject structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During scan , subject lie table slide cylinder , wear earplug muffle loud knocking noise associate scan process . Total scan time 30 minute At third visit , subject perform simple movement task functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan . The procedure structural MRI , except subject ask perform simple movement task scanner . Before fMRI scan , electrode attach subject 's arm legs monitor muscle activity ( surface electromyography ) . Total scan time 1.5 hour . Movement task might include pinch force-measuring instrument finger , press different key keyboard fast possible , insert peg small hole board , lift weight , flip card similar activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The purpose protocol acquire information type cortical reorganization associate different stroke lesion . This important formulating hypothesis lesion-specific type cortical plasticity follow stroke . Understanding lesion-specific cortical reorganization essential advance understanding mechanism ( ) underlie functional reorganization recovery stroke . This protocol establish neuroimaging database brain activation stroke patient various lesion site use task-controlled functional high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method detail monitoring task performance scanner ( electromyography [ EMG ] motor kinematics ) . Specifically , propose acquire follow new patient clinic stroke least 3 month prior visit : 1 . A high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan T2-weighted MRI ; use characterize lesion location quantify tissue loss . 2 . A functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan standardize motor task . Both repeat every two year , 10 year provide preliminary information consistency plastic change time chronic stage . This information use generate future hypotheses power analysis lesion-specific form cortical reorganization . STUDY POPULATION : One hundred twenty five stroke patient age 18 motor function impairment . DESIGN : All stroke patient protocol complete follow evaluation initial visit : clinical interview neurological exam , National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIH Stroke Scale ) , Medical Research Council ( MRC ) , Jebsen-Taylor score . Following initial screening , subject ask participate two MRI session every two year . Session 1 include anatomical MRI scan ( T1- T2-weighted ) ; Session 2 involves BOLD functional MRI scan . OUTCOME MEASURES : Outcome measure include lesion locus size , gray matter loss ( volume size ) , white matter loss ( volume size ) , total white matter volume , total gray matter volume , pattern fMRI BOLD activation within across session , NIH Stroke scale , MRC , Jebsen-Taylor test score .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must age 18 subacute ( least 3 month post stroke ) thromboembolic hemorrhagic stroke impair motor function least one limb capable performing require motor task . Assessment initial functional state take initial visit NINDS Stroke Neurorehabilitation Clinic . Patients additional stroke ( ) length protocol exclude study condition state Exclusion Criteria satisfy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients history alcohol drug abuse , poor motivational capacity , language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 23 less ) . 2 . Patients medical technical contraindication MRI procedure ( e.g . metal brace , pacemaker , cochlear device , surgical clip , metal/magnetic implant ) ; claustrophobia ; pregnancy . 3 . Patients unable comply motor test protocol .</criteria>
