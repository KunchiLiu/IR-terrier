	<brief_summary>The rationale study determine whether GW856553 ( 7.5mg BD 28 day ) effect endothelial function dyslipidaemic subject assess venous occlusion plethysmography use brachial artery acetylcholine infusion . This establish consistency preclinical finding , well confirm physiologic human response current safe maximal dose . Safety ( specifically serum liver function test ) tolerability also evaluate trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy adult male females 18 75 year age , inclusive . To eligible , female subject must negative pregnancy test ( i.e . Urine serum βhCG ( female ) : nonchildbearing potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant ) . This include female postmenopausal . OR childbearing potential agree commit one protocolapproved method contraception . Body weight &gt; 50 kg body mass index ( BMI ) 19 32kg/m2 Subjects high LDLc level , per NCEP ATPIII criterion : fasting LDLc level &gt; 4.1 mmol/L ( 160 mg/dL ) , inclusive . Fasting TG level &lt; 4.5mmol/L ( 400 mg/dL ) A sign date write informed consent prior admission study The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction . The following criterion must apply subject undergo FDGPET/CT MRI All diabetic exclude scan substudy involve MRI FDGPET/CT . Subjects exclude previously participate research and/or medical protocol involve nuclear medicine , PET radiological investigation significant radiation burden ( significant radiation burden define ICRP category IIb : No 10 mSv effective radiation dose addition natural background radiation , previous 3 year include dose study ) . Given plan administration 10 mSv study , subject expose ionize radiation background level , example result work radiation category A ( classify ) worker , exclude Adult male females 50 75 year age , inclusive . Women must nonchildbearing potential [ i.e . either postmenopausal document hysterectomy tubal ligation sufficient ] . To eligible , female subject must negative pregnancy test ( i.e . serum beta hCG test ) nonchildbearing potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant ) . This include female postmenopausal . All diabetic exclude scan substudy involve MRI FDGPET/CT . Contraindication MRI scanning ( assessed local MRI safety questionnaire ) include limited : Intracranial aneurysm clip ( except Sugita ) appropriate operative conformation , History intra orbital metal fragment remove MD , Pacemakers nonMR compatible heart valve , Inner ear implant , History claustrophobia MR. Is unable lie comfortably bed inside PET camera head field view least 60 minute assess physical examination medical history ( e.g . back pain , arthritis ) . The following criterion apply healthy control subject A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Healthy adult male 18 75 year age , inclusive . Body weight &gt; 50 kg body mass index ( BMI ) 19 32kg/m2 A sign date write informed consent prior admission study The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction . Blood pressure &lt; =140 mmHg systolic and/or &lt; =90mmHg diastolic ) Subjects LDLc , &lt; 2.6 mmol/L ( 100 mg/dL ) . Fasting TG level &lt; 1.7mmol/L ( 150 mg/dL ) ; HDLc &gt; 1.0 mmol/L ( 40mg/dL ) Nonsmokers History symptomatic coronary artery disease , stroke , know atherosclerotic disease . Subjects current smoker require cigarette within 30 minute wake morning , abstain smoke approximately 5 hour . History chronic viral hepatitis ( include presence hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis C antibody ) , chronic hepatic disorder . History increase liver function test ( ALT , AST ) due acute chronic liver condition , upper limit normal past 6 month and/or liver function test ( bilirubin , ALT , AST ) upper limit normal Screening . Renal impairment creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min screening , history kidney transplant history contrast nephropathy . Current inadequately control hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg systolic and/or &gt; 100mmHg diastolic ) subject experience modified regimen antihypertensive medication within 6 week prior first dose study medication , subject likely commence treatment hypertensive medication Current poorly control diabetes mellitus , define HbA1c &gt; 10 % Screen . History heart failure define NYHA class II IV know severe LV dysfunction ( EF &lt; 30 % ) regardless symptomatic status History malignancy within past 5 year , nonmelanoma skin cancer . Current lifethreatening condition vascular disease ( e.g. , severe chronic airway disease , HIV positive , lifethreatening arrhythmia ) may prevent subject complete study . Alcohol drug abuse within past 6 month . Previous exposure GW856553 . Use investigational device investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication . Subjects commence likely commence treatment oral intranasal topical corticosteroid , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) ( aspirin ) , PPARγ agonists ( e.g . rosiglitazone ) , sulfonylureas , insulin , fibrates , niacin , ACEI , ARBs , nitrate , HRT , etc screen study completion . Any nonstable dosing ongoing medication regimen ( note ( # 14 ) ) throughout study trial . Any subject likely commence statin treatment screen final follow visit . Any subject currently receive treatment statin must able washout statin 28 day prior first dose study medication . The subject three month prior history regular alcohol consumption exceed average weekly intake &gt; 28 unit ( average daily intake great 3 unit ) male , average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit ( average daily intake great 2 unit ) female positive alcohol breath test screen visit A positive urine test drug abuse ( relate know medication subject take , ie , codeine pain management ) alcohol screen prior study medication administration . Any subject Investigator deems unsuitable study ( e.g. , due either medical reason , laboratory abnormality , expect study medication noncompliance , subject 's unwillingness comply studyrelated study procedure ) . Subjects rheumatoid arthritis , connective tissue disorder condition know associate chronic inflammation ( e.g . Inflammatory Bowel Disease ) . Subjects chronic infection gingivitis , periodontitis , prostatitis , gastritis , urinary tract infection , active disease , include active tuberculosis history active tuberculosis . Subjects acute infection , symptom suggestive sinusitis , significant trauma ( burn , fracture ) . Subjects donate 500 mL blood within 56 day prior study medication administration . History myopathy rhabdomyolysis . QTc interval &gt; 450 msec An unwillingness male subject abstain sexual intercourse pregnant lactating woman ; unwillingness subject use contraceptive method define protocol time first dose study medication 3 month administration last dose study medication .
