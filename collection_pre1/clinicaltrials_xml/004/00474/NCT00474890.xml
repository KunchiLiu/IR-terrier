	<brief_summary>A previous study show clearly treatment combination cetirizine pseudoephedrine superior treatment single agent regard reduction symptom patient allergic rhinitis . These data , obtain control pollen exposure pollen season , show highly reproducible individual response prior dose . It clear , however , whether result obtain pollen season , additional natural pollen exposure may influence variability individual reaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Compare Effect Combination Cetirizine With Pseudoephedrine Versus Placebo Symptoms Patients With Allergic Rhinitis Within/Out Season</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate prospectively , reproducible result show test combination cetirizine pseudoephedrine Environmental Exposure Unit set inside outside grass pollen season . An equivalent outcome would validate ECC test anti-allergic substance pollen season future . Up study restrict pollen-free season .</detailed_description>
