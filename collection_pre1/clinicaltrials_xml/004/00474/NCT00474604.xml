	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , MRI , may help diagnose breast cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient 's response treatment . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study breast MRI woman know suspected breast cancer healthy participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast MRI Women With Known Suspected Breast Cancer Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Develop combine advance , quantitative , multiparametric magnetic resonance image method ( i.e. , dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI [ DCE-MRI ] , diffusion-weighted MRI [ DW-MRI ] , magnetic resonance spectroscopy [ MRS ] ) characterize breast tumor woman know suspected breast cancer . - Identify surrogate biomarkers guide diagnosis treatment breast cancer use method . - Correlate biochemical information obtain magnetic resonance analysis clinical , radiologic , pathologic finding patient . - Establish imaging data bank include information DCE-MRI , DW-MRI , MRS find patient healthy participant . OUTLINE : Quantitative , multi-parametric magnetic imaging method employ breast image follow subject : - Group A : Healthy volunteer undergo 3 breast MRIs 6 week . - Group B : Patients diagnose breast cancer : 1 ) undergo preoperative breast MRI follow definitive surgery 2 ) undergo MRI prior initiate neoadjuvant chemotherapy , 1-2 week initiation chemotherapy , prior definitive surgery . Clinical information , include radiologic pathologic data , patient collect inclusion image data bank . After completion study , patient healthy participant follow periodically .</detailed_description>

Subjects must â‰¥ 18 year old . The protocol nurse check patient h/o kidney disease Normal creatinine estimate GFR* within 30 day follow circumstance Had abnormal creatinine last 60 day Are 60 year age Has receive chemotherapy within past 30 day Has diabetes , HIV , renal disease hx renal cancer * GFR calculate use : http : //www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm Patients eGFR &gt; 90ml/min report within 30 day , intervene chemotherapy treatment condition might deteriorate renal function , may receive gadolinium agent . Children exclude study . Pregnant woman woman breast feed exclude study . ( The Vanderbilt University Medical Center radiology `` MRI Procedure Screening Form '' use identify exclude subject pregnant breastfeeding . A urine pregnancy test/or serum beta HCG also perform premenopausal subject . ) Subjects find constitutionally present nonMR compatible ferromagnetic material exclude study . Patients acutely ill deem treat physician suitable candidate study Subjects MRI technically feasible ( e.g . breast volume , obesity ) Subjects vascular access port implant device rat anything `` Safe '' `` Conditional 6 ''</criteria>
