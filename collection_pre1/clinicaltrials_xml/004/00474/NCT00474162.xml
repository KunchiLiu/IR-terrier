	<brief_summary>Pregnant woman likely form clot non-pregnant woman pregnancy increase clot factor present blood . This help prevent excess bleeding ( hemorrhage ) time delivery . Hemorrhage occur 5-15 % pregnancy throughout world , even delivery cesarean section . When hemorrhage occur anesthesiologist normally administer fluid woman 's vein ( intravenously ) rapidly replace blood woman lose . Two type fluid commonly use . One salt water solution ( saline ) starch water solution ( pentastarch ) . Use either solution common hemorrhage . These solution ( salt water solution starch solution ) use BC Women 's Hospital spinal anesthesia prevent treat low blood pressure ( common side effect spinal anesthesia ) . This standard practice whether study . You may also give , depend anesthesiologist 's preference , drug ( vasopressor ) cause blood vessel become narrow ( constrict ) prevent treat low blood pressure . Whether agree part study , anesthesiologist watch blood pressure closely throughout operation blood pressure become low he/she treat normally do . Low blood pressure also occur hemorrhage . It therefore important determine whether starch solution , effective salt solution prevent low blood pressure spinal anesthesia , affect clotting . Research non-pregnant adult ( male female ) find laboratory test blood clot change solution . For saline evidence study suggest blood may clot good normal study suggest opposite ( clot well ) . In pregnant non-pregnant adult blood clot well certain starch solution . The starch solution use BC Women 's Hospital call pentastarch research look effect clot pregnant woman . In non-pregnant adult pentastarch le effect clotting starch solution . The purpose study see pentastarch ( starch solution ) normal saline ( water salt ) give time spinal anesthesia elective cesarean section affect ability pregnant woman 's blood clot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study patient randomize one two group . One group receive saline solution ( salt water ) group receive pentastarch solution . Neither patient , anesthesiologist , obstetrician nurse know group patient . All woman participate study intravenous . Once tube vein , blood sample take intravenous solution start . The amount blood take approximately 1 tablespoon ( 15mL ) . This part routine care part study . This blood check see well form clot . The study solution ( 15 ml/kg either saline starch solution , approximately 1 litre ) attach intravenous . Once patient operating room spinal anesthetic give remainder study solution give rapidly 10 minute vein . Once study solution give , patient receive saline solution intravenous rate determine anesthesiologist accord normal practice . Five minute study solution give , blood sample ( 15 mL ) take intravenous test first blood sample . A third blood sample take approximately 85 minute later . As blood sample take intravenous , patient needle inserted take . Approximately 10 % time may possible take blood sample intravenous . If happen investigator anesthesiologist want take blood sample opposite arm intravenous . The patient tell go happen withdraw study time . This affect care patient receives . To minimize discomfort blood take opposite arm skin make numb local anesthetic . You treat woman cesarean section spinal anesthesia exception 1. patient anesthesiologist know study solution give 2 three blood sample take - total 3 tablespoon ( total : 3x1 tablespoon ) . For purpose study use information collect patient normal course anesthetic , include total amount fluid receive cesarean section , need , type amount medication cesarean section , estimate total amount blood lose operation . These addition result laboratory test clot . There extra time cost involve patient .</detailed_description>
