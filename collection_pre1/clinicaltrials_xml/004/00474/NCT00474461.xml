	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety intracoronary cardiac stem cell ( CSCs ) therapy human . Currently , effective intervention regenerate ( regrow ) dead heart muscle heart attack . The central hypothesis CSCs infuse nonviable myocardial segment regenerate infarcted myocardium differentiate cardiomyocytes cell type . According hypothesis , CSC infusion regenerate myocardium consequent improvement contractile function heart general clinical status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label study involve 20 patient 20 control . This study do collaborative project Brigham Women 's Hospital The University Louisville . This study phase I trial assess safety feasibility intracoronary autologous CSC [ harvest right atrial appendage ( RAA ) ] transplantation patient ischemic cardiomyopathy . The study conduct two stage : Stage A , investigator obtain initial assessment safety feasibility , stage B , investigator adopt block randomization strategy enable u assess feasibility conduct subsequent , randomized phase II trial . While investigator also hope estimate efficacy , focus specific aim future phase II trial . All patient undergo on-pump CABG screen twice . The initial screening do determine preliminary eligibility ( before-CABG screening ) patient study . If patient satisfy preliminary eligibility criterion state , right atrial appendage , routinely resect on-pump bypass surgery , collect process . Thereafter , CSCs culture expand RAA . The second screening occur average 4 ± 1 month CABG surgery , utilize LVEF &lt; 40 % assessed cardiac MRI and/or disk summation method [ Simpson 's method ] use echocardiography , final enrollment . - The preliminary eligibility criterion utilize EF &lt; 40 % measure following : cardiac imaging test perform within 2 week prior screen : echocardiography , gate SPECT and/or LV angiography . - A maximum 60 patient satisfy preliminary eligibility criterion enrol preliminary phase study ( i.e. , RAA tissue harvested/cultured/expanded ) . Of 60 patient , maximum 20 enrol final phase study ( i.e. , undergo CSC injection subsequent follow-up ) . - In open-label study , maximum 20 patient eventually receive intracoronary CSC transplantation . These patient nonviable myocardium/scar prior MI undergo CABG ICM . - Enrollment patient do two stage : Stage A stage B . - In stage A , 9 consecutive patient enrol treatment arm follow 4 consecutive patient control arm . Stage A enable u perform initial assessment whether process harvesting , processing , administer cardiac stem cell associate common/frequent short-term adverse effect . - In stage B , patient randomize treated control arm use 2:3 ratio block size 5 final variable block . As result , total number treat control patient 20 . More specifically , 11 treat 16 control patient make stage B . To ensure randomization do time final enrollment , right atrial tissue harvest cardiac stem cell grown patient meet enrollment criterion time initial enrollment . If patient randomize control arm , his/her cell discard . - Patients satisfy preliminary eligibility criterion enrol revascularized within day ( &lt; 2 week ) enrollment . - Patients receive venous and/or arterial graft need CABG surgery . Nonviable myocardial segment also revascularized order enable subsequent intracoronary delivery CSCs scar region . - During on-pump CABG surgery , patient undergo resection part RAA cannulation site ( do routinely CABG surgery ) . Resected RAA tissue ( &lt; 1 g ) collect intra-operatively handle describe preparation section . - Cardiac catheterization ( coronary angiography ) intracoronary injection CSCs perform 4 ± 1 month CABG surgery . Worldwide , 500 patient receive intracoronary infusion stem cell ( derive bone marrow peripheral blood ) . None patient adverse event result infusion . The overall objective project determine whether intracoronary delivery CSCs regenerate non-viable myocardial segment patient ICM . CSCs harvest right atrial appendage ( RAAs ) patient ICM surgical revascularization , culture expanded vitro , transplant back patient . The specific aim : 1 . To determine feasibility harvest CSCs RAAs patient undergo surgical revascularization , culture expand vitro , inject patient via intracoronary route 2 . To determine safety intracoronary infusion CSCs In addition safety data , hope obtain initial evidence CSC administration result clinical improvement .</detailed_description>
