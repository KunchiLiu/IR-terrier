	<brief_summary>This study cluster-randomized trial conduct state Haryana North India . Eighteen geographical area serve Primary Health Centres ( PHCs ) randomize intervention comparison area . In intervention area , physician , health worker ICDS worker train IMNCI . Each cluster approximate population 30,000 . The IMNCI intervention include three main component : 1. improvement case management skill health staff 2. improvement overall health system support performance , 3. improvement family community health care practice include : - prevention management hypothermia - early initiation breastfeed exclusive breastfeed - community-based care low birth weight infant - improve care-seeking neonatal infection The primary outcome measure study neonatal infant mortality . The study also collect information cause-specific neonatal mortality , ascertain use standardize previously validate verbal autopsy instrument administer trained , skilled health worker . All outcome ( include initiation breastfeeding within 1 hour birth ; Exclusive breastfeed 4 week age ; Proportion neonates identify sick caregiver seek care ) secondary outcome . The effectiveness comprehensive intervention measure compare primary secondary outcome measure intervention comparison cluster , control baseline difference predefined outcomes and/or socioeconomic status demography . The project serve guide Government India best implement IMNCI strategy measure impact .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The primary objective study determine effectiveness deliver community facility base newborn intervention part IMNCI strategy : - reducing ( ) neonatal mortality beyond first 24 hour birth , i.e . 1-28 day age ( ii ) overall neonatal mortality , i.e . birth 28 day age , community receive intervention [ base cohort infant born woman identify pregnancy surveillance ] - reducing ( ) neonatal mortality beyond first 24 hour life ( day 1-28 ) ( ii ) overall neonatal mortality ( birth 28 day age ) population newborn likely great impact intervention , i.e . bear home available study area within 7 day birth [ base cohort infant bear home available study area within 7 day birth ] - reduce infant mortality ( birth 365 day age ) intervention community [ base cohort infant born woman identify pregnancy surveillance ] The secondary objective study determine effectiveness deliver community facility base newborn intervention part IMNCI strategy : - improve newborn care practice household . SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATES Sample size estimate revise subsequent expansion primary objective completion one year surveillance . Cohort identify pregnancy surveillance : The average neonatal mortality rate 18 site first year study 42 ( range 31-52 ) cohort infant born woman identify pregnancy surveillance .The neonatal mortality rate beyond first 24 hour birth cohort 24 ( range 19-31 ) . We estimate average 3700 neonates per cluster would enrol study enrollment period 27 month take account 10 % attrition , detect 20 % difference mortality 80 % power 95 % confidence level . Population likely great impact intervention : The average neonatal mortality rate target population newborn likely benefit intervention i.e . bear home available study area within 7 day birth 36 ( range 19-43 ) . The mortality beyond first 24 hour birth cohort 22 ( range 13-25 ) . On average 2000 neonates per cluster would enrol study enrollment period 27 month . This would enable u detect 25 % difference mortality 80 % power 95 % confidence level . To summarise , 27 month enrollment give 80 % power detect : In pregnancy cohort : - 20 % great reduction neonatal mortality . - 20 % mortality neonates beyond first 24 hour birth . In population likely great impact ( i.e . bear home available study area within 7 day birth ) : - 25 % great reduction mortality birth 28 day - 25 % great reduction neonatal mortality beyond first 24 hour birth . The sample size also estimate process evaluation outcome observation health facility ( quality care health facility ) exit interview ( knowledge skills mother home care illness ) . Our guesstimate proportion control group base experience work area . The number cluster take 9 per group base sample size calculation mortality discuss . The table show 50 observation 50 exit interview per cluster ( i.e . 450 observation exit interview intervention cluster 450 control cluster i.e . total 1800 ) would adequate detect 20 % absolute increase outcome 90 % power . THE INTERVENTION The intervention design follow guideline developed Government India collaboration WHO UNICEF ( 2 ) . The intervention include three main component : 1 . Improving case management skill health staff : Qualified physician , supervisor health worker intervention site along anganwadi worker train IMNCI 8 day course . A set information meeting design traditional birth attendant register medical practitioner qualify physician work private sector . The training complete visit trainee his/her work place within 1 month course review performance , correct problem support use skill taught course . 2 . Strengthening health system . As part collaboration project , effort undertake District Medical Officer 's team implement follow health system improvement focus intervention area : Availability drug supply need IMNCI : In order ensure availability essential IMNCI drug supply checklist prepared displayed health facility . This list use checklist Supervisory Visits . Improving referral pathway service : Facilities keep record case attend , case refer problem review supervisory visit review meeting program charge local health team different category health worker . Supervisory Visits : Both schedule unscheduled visit conduct supervisor ( belong local heath system provide project ) train IMNCI . Supervisors review availability facility support drug implement IMNCI , well health worker performance , provide feedback help problem-solving . 3 . Improvement family community practice . The aim component IMNCI strategy initiate , reinforce sustain key family practice child survival , growth development . Practices particular importance newborn health ( early initiation breastfeed avoidance pre-lacteal feed ; keep baby warm , avoid early bathing , cord hygiene , care seek danger sign special attention LBW newborn ) promote addition standard IMCI key practice ( 3 ) . OUTCOME ASCERTAINMENT One field worker allocate 2000 3000 household keep his/her area surveillance identify pregnant woman . For pregnancy identify , visit make household day coincide infant age ~1 month document outcome pregnancy . Subsequent visit make infant age 3 , 6 , 9 12 month record vital status infant . PROCESS EVALUATION ACTIVITIES These conduct 6 member team intervention control cluster essentially focus activity ascertain well intervention implement . The evaluation conduct small subsample various activity 18 cluster include follow : - Observations health care provider , consultation caregiver infant age &lt; 29 day infant 1 11 month age - Exit interview mother recently visit health care provider treatment illness infant age &lt; 29 day infant 1 11 month age . - Interviews caregivers/mothers young infant home visit recently health worker DATA MANAGEMENT Forms fill field manually self-checked miss information , data range consistency person fill form . A double data entry system use follow validation merge double enter clean data . ANALYSIS Socioeconomic , environmental demographic characteristic intervention control cluster examine group comparability . Any significant difference control data analysis . The potential confounders data collect baseline include : - Distance near government outpatient facility - Distance near private outpatient facility - Distance near government inpatient facility - Distance near private inpatient facility - Density private provider - Density qualify private provider - Number private practitioner use care infants The frequency main study variable examine assess distribution data . If data normally distribute , decision need data transformation appropriateness statistical test make . Efficacy evaluation do compare primary secondary outcome measure intervention control cluster , control socioeconomic , environmental demographic difference . To account clustered nature data , technique Generalized Estimating Equation multi-level modelling use . Data analysis carry use Stata , Version 8.2 . REFERENCES 1 . Smith PG , Morrow RH .
