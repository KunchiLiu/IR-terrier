	<detailed_description>Introduction Among patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , robust evidence base support beneficial effect statin therapy mortality adverse cardiovascular outcome . Recently , two large trial , demonstrate compare standard dose statin therapy , high statin dos reduce Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) extremely low level decrease coronary event , even patient normal level Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) . Subsequently , recent guideline suggest Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) treatment goal &lt; 70 mg/dL patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Achieving low Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) level frequently demand intensive Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) reduction , often 50 % . Ezetimibe , intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor , use additional therapy statin monotherapy fail reduce Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) treatment goal . Furthermore , anti-inflammatory antithrombotic pleiotropic effect statin might explain , least part , large benefit demonstrate randomized trial , . For example , hypercholesterolemic patient treat statin , decrease inflammation-associated marker C-reactive protein ( CRP ) describe , although debate whether effect clearly independent Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) . Moreover , although inhibition platelet statin therapy well establish effect , , yet clarify whether platelet inhibition statin therapy depend reduction Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) inhibition intracellular signal pathway accompany disaggregating effect . Two alternative pharmacologic strategy equally effective reduce Low-density lipoprotein-C ( LDL-C ) : high-dose statin alone combine treatment ezetimibe plus moderate-dose statin . It know whether two strategy different cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effect inflammation platelet . We therefore compare anti-inflammatory antiplatelet effect two intensive pharmacologic strategy reduce cholesterol : 80 mg simvastatin ( S80 ) versus 10 mg ezetimibe/ 20 mg simvastatin ( E10/S20 ) . Anti-inflammatory effect assess perform serial measurement follow biomarkers : C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 , oxidize Low-density lipoprotein-C ( oxLDL ) , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule ( sICAM ) -1 . Platelet aggregation also compare two strategy .</detailed_description>
