	<brief_summary>This research do know best treatment advance Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck . These cancer treat combination surgery , radiation chemotherapy vary combination . When tumor inoperable , radiation therapy use without chemotherapy hope cure tumor . Recently , become recognize generalized knowledge cancer cell hypoxic ( low oxygen concentration ) . Because low oxygen concentration , many cancer treatment successful . The theory behind study give oxygen patient prior chemotherapy radiation hop generate great result kill cancer cell . The purpose study two main objective . The primary objective determine patient tolerance arm trial . The second objective determine feasibility treatment delivery acute toxicity associate regimen . It intention undertake randomize control trial Phase I trial prove successful term patient tolerance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Hyperbaric Oxygen With Radiation Chemotherapy Treat Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study see patient tolerate HBO therapy five day week . Three patient Arm 1 ( HBO Monday Friday ) observe throughout course concomitant radiation , chemo hyperbaric therapy . If patient appear tolerate protocol well , adverse effect directly attribute HBO observe , three patient recruit Arm 2 ( HBO Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) . If patient appear tolerate protocol well , adverse effect directly attribute HBO observe , third group three patient recruit Arm 3 ( HBO Monday Friday ) . If Grade IV acute toxicity report single patient arm , 3 patient recruited arm . If adverse event occur , protocol progress next arm . If Grade IV acute toxicity observe even single patient , study stop . Tumor and/or lymphatic tissue specimen obtain prior start treatment . Tumor tissue specimen analyze determine whether predictive susceptibility tumor HBO sensitization use currently define biomarkers know correlate survival .</detailed_description>
