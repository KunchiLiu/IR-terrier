	<brief_title>Safety And Feasibility Early DischargE - Prospective And Randomized Trial Low-risk Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) traditionally hospitalize least 5-7 day monitor serious complication , include heart failure , arrhythmia , re-infarction death . With advent primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment choice STEMI , few patient complete infarct incidence complication decrease . The Zwolle Primary PCI Index one several externally validate risk score use identify low-risk primary PCI patient safely discharge 48-72 hour . Recent review find majority primary PCI patient risk score deem `` low-risk '' keep hospital longer predict score . SAFE-DEPART trial low-risk primary rescue PCI patient randomize either intervention arm ( early hospital discharge , early outpatient follow-up nurse practitioner ) standard care ( recommend discharge date , outpatient follow-up nurse practitioner ) . At 6 week time , blind research assistant contact patient collect data feasibility , safety , quality-of-life , cost-effectiveness outcome .</detailed_description>
