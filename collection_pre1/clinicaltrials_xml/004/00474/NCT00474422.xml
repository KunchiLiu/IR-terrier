Univariate relationships outcome measure maternal characteristic determine Student t-test exclusive breastfeeding , Pearson correlation volume formula supplement . Binary logistic regression use determine relationship binary outcome group assignment . Results report odds ratio 95 % confidence interval mean ± SD appropriate . Because relatively high rate non-compliance , secondary analysis conduct treatment receive . Multivariate model adjust potential confounding .</detailed_description>
