	<brief_title>An Safety Efficacy Study Abiraterone Acetate Participants With Advanced Prostate Cancer Who Failed Androgen Deprivation Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single arm , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study evaluate anti-tumor activity safety abiraterone acetate participant cancer fail taxane ( docetaxel ) -based chemotherapy . Abiraterone acetate 1000 milligram ( mg ) tablet capsule administer orally ( mouth ) , daily overnight fast disease progression , lack disease response six 28-day cycle treatment , unacceptable toxicity encounter . Participants treat 12 cycle . All participant receive concurrent low-dose glucocorticoid ( prednisone 5 mg tablet twice daily/prednisolone 0.5 mg tablet daily ) . Treatment continue respond participant death , disease progression , end study ( Week 148 ) . Efficacy primarily assess prostate specific antigen response accord Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group ( PSAWG ) criterion . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study . Participants complete 12 cycle abiraterone acetate treatment , continue receive clinical benefit treatment , eligible enter extension study . Participants enter extension study continue take abiraterone acetate dose receive end main study together low-dose glucocorticoid . Efficacy safety monitor throughout extension study . Study treatment end patient dy , lose follow-up , withdraws informed consent , experience sustain side-effects , disease progression , sponsor discontinues extension study . After end study visit complete extension study , participant follow every 12 week survival 3 year follow entry extension study .</detailed_description>
