	<brief_title>Dietary Interventions Evaluating Transport Uric Acid Across Tubules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uric acid play role pathogenesis gout also predictor cardiovascular disease , hypertension renal disease man . We identify human urate ion channel transporter ( hUAT ) , locate proximal convolute tubule kidney involve secretion reabsorption urate across tubule . This channel unique lectin bind site in-vitro study , find modulate glucose , galactose lactose . We also identify mutation ( G/A polymorphism ) laboratory , in-vitro study demonstrate diminished hUAT channel activity . Cross-sectional study earlier show uric acid level vary serum glucose level . Studies also report low-fat dairy diet reduces incidence gout , others show diet reduces blood pressure significantly compare non-dairy diet . We hypothesize effect blood glucose level lower uric acid level regulation hUAT channel activity . We also hypothesize low-fat dairy diet reduces serum uric acid level hUAT regulation lead decrease incidence gout reduction blood pressure level . In proposed randomized , control , cross-over trial healthy adult volunteer , aim study effect low-fat dairy diet non-dairy diet serum uric acid level , renal fractional excretion uric acid blood pressure . We also study effect acute intravenous infusion glucose parameter . DNA analysis hUAT mutation study subject do assess blunt response hUAT activity subject polymorphism compare normal individual .</detailed_description>
