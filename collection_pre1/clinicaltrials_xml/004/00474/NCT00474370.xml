	<brief_summary>Vicriviroc ( vye-kri-VYE-rock ) investigational drug ( yet approve Government Regulatory Authorities commercial use ) belong new class drug , call CCR5 receptor blocker . This group drug block one way HIV enters T-cells ( cell fight infection ) . Previous small study HIV treatment-experienced patient , show vicriviroc safe effective . The purpose study confirm previous finding large phase 3 study 48-week period , show take combination appropriate HIV drug , vicriviroc decrease level HIV ( viral load ) blood well tolerate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vicriviroc HIV-Treatment Experienced Subjects ( Study P04889AM8 ) ( COMPLETED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multi-center study vicriviroc maleate HIV subject infect CCR5-tropic virus document resistance least 2 3 antiretroviral drug class ( NRTI , NNRTI PI ) least 6 month experience least 2 follow : one NRTI , one NNRTI , two PIs ( exclude low-dose ritonavir ) fail least one standard triple-drug regimen . The study compare virologic benefit add vicriviroc optimize background regimen control group receive placebo plus new optimize background therapy . The optimized background regimen choose investigator base result drug susceptibility test perform Screening , history prior antiretroviral drug use patient , drug toxicity . OBT must include PI boost ritonavir ( &gt; =100 mg ritonavir ) , least 2 active drug ( ie , HIV isolate fully susceptible ) . Primary efficacy analysis conduct subject complete 48 week treatment . An interim analysis perform subject complete 24 week treatment . After complete Week 48 study , subject offer open-label vicriviroc 30 mg QD , appropriate , drug commercially available sponsor terminates clinical development vicriviroc . Additionally , subject discontinue early study prior Week 48 may eligible open-label segment study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must infect HIV1 virus . Subject must document plasma HIV1 RNA &gt; 1000 copies/mL within 60 day Visit 1/Day 1 ( randomization ) must either stable regimen 3 antiretrovirals ( ART ) least 4 week prior screen visit OR ART agent least 4 week prior screen visit . Subject must ART experience document resistance least 2 follow 3 drug class : nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) ; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) ; protease inhibitor ( PI ) OR Subject must ART class experience least 6 month least two follow : one NRTI ; one NNRTI ; two PIs ( exclude lowdose ritonavir ) . Women childbearing potential must agree use medically accept method contraceptive define protocol . Subject must willing initiate CD4+ cell countguided chemoprophylaxis prevent opportunistic infection define protocol . Subjects detectable CXCR4tropic dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4tropic HIV isolate Screening . Subjects prior history malignancy ( exception cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma without visceral mucosal involvement resolve HAART without systemic anticancer treatment , basalcell carcinoma skin ) ; prior receipt cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy may increase risk malignancy . Subjects seizure disorder require antiseizure therapy condition likely increase risk seizure ( CNS malignancy toxoplasmosis ) .</criteria>
