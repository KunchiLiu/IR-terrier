	<brief_title>Relative Bioavailability Ferric Pyrophosphate From Apple Juice Drink</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Micronized dispersible ferric pyrophosphate ( MDFP ) iron compound report highly bioavailable likely cause sensory problem add food . It therefore potentially effective iron additive food industry particularly formulate add liquid . A randomized cross−over trial undertaken compare absorption iron add commercial apple juice drink MDFP iron add ferrous sulphate . The null hypothesis absorption iron add MDFP different absorption iron add ferrous sulphate . The study population consist 16 woman ( age 18−65 ) iron store low end normal range . This group efficiently absorb bioavailable iron sensitive difference bioavailability different form iron . Test drink contain add iron , label stable isotope iron ( Fe−57 Fe−58 ) , consume two consecutive day . Iron absorption drink determine use erythrocyte incorporation technique . A baseline blood sample take prior consume test drink second blood sample take 14 day last test drink . Iron absorption calculate isotopic enrichment final blood sample , assume 80 % absorb iron incorporate red blood cell . The order volunteer give MDFP ferrous sulphate randomise .</detailed_description>
