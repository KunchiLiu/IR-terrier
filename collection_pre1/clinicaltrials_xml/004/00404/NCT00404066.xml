	<detailed_description>This trial combine dose dense chemotherapy Doxorubicin Cyclophosphamide ( AC ) follow standard every 3 week docetaxel GW572016 neoadjuvant treatment her2neu positive stage II/III breast cancer . GW572016 Lapatinib , investigational agent , act duel inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ErbB-2 ( Her2/neu ) tyrosine kinase activity . EGFR ErbB2 receptor frequently over-expressed altered human cancer include breast cancer . This study plan determine antitumor activity regimen effectiveness prevent tumor growth spread . The primary objective study improve pathological complete response rate addition dual EGFR blockade . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) show predict improve long-term survival serf surrogate clinical outcome . By use primary endpoint obtain statistical data small patient number low overall cost . Additionally , hope correlate clinical radiologic outcome gene expression data .</detailed_description>
