	<brief_title>Infections Caused ESbL-Producing Enterobacteriaceae Italy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PLAN AND METHODOLOGY Population All patient infection ( i.e . bacteremia , pneumonia , abdomen infection , skin infection , urinary tract infection ) cause ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae . Exclusion criterion Children &lt; 16 year Trial design Multicenter prospective cohort study . Patients correspond study definition detect daily inspection microbiological databases one dedicated physician . Epidemiological variable detect patient study admission . To identify risk factor infection ( i.e . bacteremia , pneumonia , abdomen infection , skin infection , urinary tract infection ) cause ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae case-control study perform . A case patient define adult patient (  16 year age ) infection cause ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae accord definition Center Diseases Control Prevention Atlanta ( CDC ) . In Clinical Microbiology Laboratories , definition ESBL production Clinical Microbiology Laboratories accord CLSI guideline ( 3 ) , BSAC guideline ( http : //www.bsac.org.uk ) species Klebsiella spp. , E. coli Proteus mirabilis . One control select case . Control choose among adult patient admitted hospital period ( within 30 day ) ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolate hospital stay . If one control available per case , patient date time admission close case chosen . To identify risk factor mortality second case-control study perform compare infected patient die infected patient survive ( evaluable patient bacteremia , wound infection , pneumonia , meningitis , ) . This analysis perform adjusting result inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy site infection ( see follow definition ) . Data collection Medical record in-patient admission microbiology pharmacy database review . Data collect study enrollment include : patient demographic , transfer another hospital , resident long term facility nursing home , previous hospitalization within one year , ambulatory status , requirement chronic hemodialysis , presence central venous catheter ( CVC ) , ICU stay surgical procedure 30 day prior study inclusion . A composite score co-morbid illness derive use Charlson score . The severity illness presentation quantify use criterion McCabe Jackson . Antibiotics administer 30-day period prior study enrollment least 48 hour record . For risk factor analysis , oral intravenous antibiotic exposure analyse individual antibiotic class , include penicillin , vancomycin , cephalosporin , antibiotic predominantly anaerobic activity ( metronidazole clindamycin ) , aminoglycosides , quinolones , carbapenems . Length stay ( LOS ) infection diagnosis , management infection , time type antimicrobial therapy , result follow-up clinical culture ( ) , hematogenous complication death also extract medical record . Microbiology record also review recovery vancomycin resistant enterococci ( VRE ) methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) 12 month prior study enrollment . All patient infection cause ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae follow hospital discharge death . Mortality define death occur study hospitalization . Appropriate antimicrobial therapy define initiation therapy activity ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae ( accord result antimicrobial susceptibility pattern isolate ) day 2 day initial positive clinical culture result . Outcomes Primary outcome 1 . Risk factor development infection cause ESBL producer bacteria ; 2 . Risk factor inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy ; 3 . Overall mortality 30-day mortality among patient receive inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy ( evaluable patient bacteremia , abdominal infection pneumonia , ) ; 4 . Variability site infection overall mortality 30-day mortality among patient receive inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy ( evaluable patient bacteremia , abdominal infection pneumonia , ) . Secondary outcomes 1 . Lenght hospitalization ; 2 . Costs inadequate initial therapy ; 3 . Days defervescence . Statistical analysis At end study two different analysis perform : first one consider patient bacteremia , abdominal infection pneumonia , focused mortality ; second analysis consider infect patient focus risk factor analysis secondary outcome . Sample size justification Assumptions Patients bacteremia , pneumonia , abdomen infection , skin infection urinary tract infection ( first analysis ) : Mortality among patient inadequate initial therapy : 25 % Mortality among patient appropriate initial therapy : 13 % All include patient : Percentage bacteremia : 20 % Percentage pneumonia : 10 % Percentage abdomen infection : 15 % Percentage skin infection : 3 % Percentage urinary tract infection : 52 % Primary outcomes Risk factor mortality Difference mortality control ( inappropriate therapy ) case ( appropriate therapy ) : anticipate reduction 25 % 13 % . Secondary outcome Difference length hospitalization case ( appropriate therapy ) control ( inappropriate therapy ) : anticipate decrease 80 % ( length hospitalization &lt; 15 day ) 40 % . Difference defervescence case ( appropriate therapy ) control ( inappropriate therapy ) : anticipate decrease 85 % ( defervescence &lt; 3 day ) 30 % . Assuming p1=p2 , p1 proportion population 1 p2 proportion population 2 alpha=0.05 ( two-sided ) , power=0.80 . Required sample size analysis risk factor mortality : 366 patient bacteremia , wound infection , pneumonia , meningitis . To include 366 patient report infection total sample size likely 813 patient infected ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae . Microbiological analysis bacterial strain All ESBL-producing isolates obtain patient include study Clinical Microbiology Laboratories Clinical Center collect subjected investigation include : - confirmation identification specie level ; - determination antimicrobial resistance profile standard set drug ; - analysis ESBL determinant ; - analysis clonal relationship bacterial isolates specie . Results microbiological analysis use correlation clinical data assess epidemiological clinical impact ESBL-producing strain . Experimental methodology Confirmation identification bacterial isolate specie level carry standard phenotypic method ( 10 ) . In case ambiguity result , identification confirm 16S rDNA sequencing ( 16 ) . Antimicrobial susceptibility test carry broth microdilution recommend CLSI ( 3 ) , categorical assignment carry use CLSI breakpoints ( 3 ) . The following agent include : ertapenem , imipenem , meropenem , cefepime , ceftazidime , cefotaxime , piperacillin/tazobactam , amoxicillin/clavulanate , ciprofloxacin , levofloxacin , gentamicin , amikacin . The nature ESBL determinant investigate molecular analysis use PCR sequencing , describe previously ( 9 , 15 ) . The presence ESBL determinants TEM- , SHV , CTX-M- PER-type ( i. e. know circulate Italy ( 9 , 15 ) ) investigate . In case negative result available probe , ESBL phenotype reconfirm , positive , nature -lactamase deerminants study mean : ( ) analytical isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) crude extract use previously describe method ( 14 ) ; ( ii ) DNA microarray technology , use microarray β-lactamase gene develop laboratory , include probe uncommon ESBL gene VEB , GES , BES , SFO , TLA enzymes . In case new ESBL gene undetected method ( unlikely occurrence ) , In case production ESBL unaccounted presence know resistance determinant , resistance determinant study mean shotgun-cloning approach follow map sequence . Clonal relatedness among isolates specie investigate high-throughput genotyping technique RAPD ( Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA ) and/or AFLP ( Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism ) analysis and/or REP PCR ( 19-21 ) . In select isolates , clonal relationship perform macrorestriction analysis genomic DNA pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) . Plasmid analysis investigation resistance determinant non β-lactam agent ( molecular technique ) consider select case , information relevant correlation clinical epidemiological data .</detailed_description>
