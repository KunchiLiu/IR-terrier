	<brief_summary>The loss deep inhalation bronchoprotection asthmatic individual show related degree airway hyperresponsiveness , hallmark asthma . In several study , asthmatic individual mild airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) ( methacholine PC20 &gt; 2 mg/mL ) difference methacholine PC20 without deep inhalation average 1.8 double methacholine concentration ( p=0.0003 ) . Conversely , asthmatic individual moderate severe AHR ( methacholine PC20 â‰¤ 2 mg/mL ) non-significant difference methacholine PC20 without deep inhalation ( p=0.09 ) . This loss deep inhalation bronchoprotection also believe play important role pathogenesis asthma . Airway inflammation another key feature asthma information airway inflammation increasingly used diagnosis treatment asthma . The level airway inflammation ( measure fraction exhale nitric oxide sputum eosinophilia ) also show correlated level airway hyperresponsiveness ( measure methacholine PC20 ) . In addition , glucocorticoid show decrease airway hyperresponsiveness , suggest two phenomenon , airway inflammation airway hyperresponsiveness , relate . We therefore suggest degree airway inflammation relate loss deep inhalation bronchoprotection expect negative correlation degree deep inhalation bronchoprotection airway inflammation .</brief_summary>
