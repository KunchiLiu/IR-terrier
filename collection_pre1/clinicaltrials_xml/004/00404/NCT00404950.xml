	<brief_title>Effects Hyperglycemia During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance : Postoperative renal dysfunction common complication cardiopulmonary bypass occur nearly 8 % patient undergoing myocardial revascularization . Both diabetes preoperative hyperglycemia independent risk factor postoperative renal dysfunction coronary artery bypass surgery . The cause renal injury multifactoral case involve renal ischemia alteration renal perfusion , resistance , metabolic byproduct ( free-radical specie ) , inflammatory mediator embolic process . In set ischemia , specifically , neuronal , hyperglycemia show worsen neurologic outcome interfere wound healing-possibly increase incidence wound infection . Hyperglycemia common cardiopulmonary bypass diabetic non-diabetic patient result alter glucose regulation hypothermic condition ( body temperature actively cool 28 degree centigrade ) , importantly , delivery cardioplegia arrest heart allow surgical repair non-beating heart . The cardioplegia rich potassium , among agent , believe offer cardioprotection cardiopulmonary bypass prepare Dextrose 5 % normal saline . On average , patient receives nearly 2 liter solution , amount 100 gram glucose . In set , hyperglycemia also promote insulin suppression , stress hormone induce gluconeogenesis enhance tubular resorption . Only recently perioperative clinician become aware potential ischemic effect hyperglycemia bypass need maintain 'tight ' control glucose avoid stroke . This practice , however , inconsistent mostly apply diabetic patient . We hypothesize tubular injury may exacerbate hyperglycemia non-diabetic patient undergo hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass undertaken prospective observational study investigate relationship intraoperative glucose postoperative renal dysfunction . Methodology : We plan study 200 patient ≥ 50 year age schedule procedure require cardiopulmonary bypass whether coronary revascularization valvular surgery . After informed consent obtain patient 's preoperative lab value consist serum glucose , urine glucose , creatinine BUN note . Each patient 's pre-induction hemodynamics also note . During bypass , serum urine glucose measure every 20 minute addition collect information temperature cardioplegic solution , low patient temperature , time bypass , use diuretic , vasoactive drug . Additional sample serum creatinine glucose vital sign take place upon arrival cardiac intensive care unit surgery throughout hospitalization standard care cardiac surgery institution . No extra sample take standard measurement observe . The clinical outcome interest new onset renal dysfunction define post-operative serum creatinine change 0.5 mg/dl great surgery . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Male female patient ≥ 50 year age 2 . Patients undergo pump cardiopulmonary bypass either myocardial revascularization ( coronary artery bypass graft ) valvular surgery ( valve repair replacement ) Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Patients insulin dependent diabetes 2 . Patients preexist renal dysfunction define Creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl 3 . Patients need emergency cardiac procedure</detailed_description>
