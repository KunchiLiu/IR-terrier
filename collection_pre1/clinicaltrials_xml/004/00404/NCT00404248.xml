	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , tetra-O-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( EM-1421 ) , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose EM-1421 see well work treat patient recurrent high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tetra-O-Methyl Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) tetra-O-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( EM-1421 ) patient recurrent high-grade glioma . ( Phase I ) - Determine response rate patient treat EM-1421 administer MTD . ( Phase II ) Secondary - Describe pharmacokinetics EM-1421 patient . ( Phase I ) - Determine effect hepatic enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant pharmacokinetic profile EM-1421 patient . ( Phase I ) - Determine toxicity drug patient . ( Phase I ) - Assess tolerability drug patient . ( Phase I ) - Assess antitumor activity drug , term overall survival . ( Phase I ) - Assess overall survival patient . ( Phase II ) - Assess safety tolerability EM-1421 give MTD patient . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II , open-label study . Patients stratify accord use cytochrome P450-inducing anticonvulsant ( use anticonvulsant drug induce hepatic metabolic enzyme vs use anticonvulsant drug cause modest induction hepatic metabolic enzyme use anticonvulsant drug ) . - Phase I : Patients receive tetra-O-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( EM-1421 ) IV day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos EM-1421 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 3 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive EM-1421 phase I MTD . Blood collect day 1 5 course 1 2 treatment pharmacokinetic study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
