	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate utility dopamine transporter image monitor predict progression Parkinson disease . This study perform PRECEPT cohort , already exist cohort 806 subject recruit participate study call , A Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled , Dose-Finding Study Assess Efficacy Safety CEP-1347 Patients With Early Parkinson 's Disease - ( PRECEPT ) , sponsor Cephalon Lundbeck coordinate Parkinson Study Group . The image data long-term PRECEPT follow-up study allow u evaluate long-term progression DAT loss PD , long-term follow-up SWEDD subject , relationship long-term clinical imaging PD outcomes , relationship long-term imaging outcome genetic biochemical biomarkers PD progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The 800 early PD subject study already evaluate clinically undergone longitudinal dopamine transporter ( DAT ) image [ 123I ] ß-CIT ( baseline 22 month ) . In Follow-up imaging perform 24-month interval ( 46 70 month follow PRECEPT baseline ) . All scanning procedure perform Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) use method previously employ PRECEPT study . Subjects willing participate travel New Haven 46-month imaging visit . At IND study coordinator neurologist evaluate subject . The coordinator neurologist discus study procedure evaluate patient eligibility . Written inform consent study obtain prior perform study-related procedure . If eligible , participant inject ß-CIT 24 hour later image procedure use obtain picture brain activity use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) . This 2-day procedure repeat 70 month ( follow PRECEPT baseline ) .</detailed_description>
