	<detailed_description>CVD include disease affect heart blood vessel , include congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , stroke . CVD may associate low level n-3 fatty acid high level trans-fatty acid , research need determine role various fatty acid development CVD . Results prior study topic always reliable data self-reported dietary questionnaire fatty acid intake sometimes inaccurate . A effective way measure level fatty acid analyze blood sample . This study use blood sample participant Cardiovascular Health Study , study examine CVD risk factor older adult , determine link various fatty acid incidence CHF , AF , stroke . The result study may help researcher identify dietary factor influence development CVD old adult . This study examine previously collect data participant Cardiovascular Health Study . There study visit specifically study . Plasma sample obtain participant analyzed presence n-3 fatty acid trans-fatty acid . The study also determine incidence CHF , AF , stroke way fatty acid related hemodynamics , heart structure function , electrophysiology , insulin sensitivity , inflammation , endothelial function , obesity .</detailed_description>
