	<brief_title>Bedside Silo Versus Operative Closure Gastroschisis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A strategy block randomization utilize . The randomization block group 4 . Randomization sequence keep principal investigator . After permission obtain , next assignment obtain . This method assure physician obtain permission blind treatment group . The treatment group consist medical management , feed regimen discharge criterion . The intervention either bedside silo operative attempt closure . During attempt primary closure , abdomen close completely staff anesthesiologist surgeon agree belly tight base ventilatory parameter , vital sign appearance . If either surgeon anesthesiologist feel close abdomen tight , ring silo place operating room , silo use bedside treatment arm , child continue study . When silo place either operate room due inability close abdomen bedside , manage way . The skin dress standard fashion ( betadine jelly , xeroform kerlix ) . The dressing allow visualization bowel . No reduction do day placement . After one night observation tie gently place apply downward pressure bowel . This pressure allow increase peak ventilator pressure 2 cm H2O . One tie place subsequent day tie within 2 cm skin point patient schedule operative closure day follow placement tie . The medical management control resuscitation , sedation , ventilation feed group .</detailed_description>
