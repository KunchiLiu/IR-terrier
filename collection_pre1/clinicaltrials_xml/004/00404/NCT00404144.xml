	<detailed_description>Background information : Stent deployment treatment coronary artery stenoses evolved standard treatment nearly types coronary lesion past two decade . The initial recurrence rate bare stent range 20 30 % low risk stenosis reduce device passive coating silicon carbide , heparin , phosphorylcholine , carbon . In percutaneous transluminal treatment stenotic coronary artery diameter 3 mm , however , none currently available method , namely balloon angioplasty conventional balloon ( POBA ) deployment non-drug eluting stent show acceptable result various reason inherent approach . Although study show POBA deployment bare stent equally effective respect restenosis , recently publish meta-analysis eleven trial restenosis rate high 25.8 % POBA 34.2 % bare stent , respectively . Brachytherapy initially demonstrate encouraging result . However , due disadvantage delay endothelialization , risk associate additional stenting , cumbersome logistics site labs , brachytherapy consider valid approach . Data Sirolimus-eluting Cypher™ stent vessel average 2.60 ± 0.54 mm diameter show benefit cytostatic drug indication . However , approach introduces layer metal per se small vessel , thus , reduces vascular lumen . Study Rationale : Since none mention option percutaneous treatment small vessel coronary artery stenoses seem universally recommendable Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter consider alternative . The possible advantage either uncoated balloon bare stent include antiproliferative mode action compound . In comparison drug elute stent ( DES ) homogenous distribution compound along target vessel segment , lack chronic mechanical alteration artery ease access lesion would favor Paclitaxel-eluting balloon . However , data available use drug elute balloon small vessel disease information indication evaluate date , treatment in-stent restenosis limit . In latter indication , animal model accord unpublished result human , proliferation induce Paclitaxel-eluting balloon catheter significantly less compare uncoated balloon , Paclitaxel-coated Taxus™ stent , Sirolimus-eluting Cypher™ stent . Therefore , prudent test Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter alternative approach percutaneous transluminal treatment small vessel coronary artery lesion . Since none alternative method unequivocally show superiority , none may serve golden standard , i.e. , direct comparison . Consequently , initial step conduct single arm study Paclitaxel-eluting balloon suggest historic data serve comparison . Once result obtain prospective randomize trial shall discuss .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients stable angina pectoris ( CCS class 13 ) unstable angina pectoris ( Braunwald class 12 , AC ) document ischemia document silent ischemia Patients eligible coronary revascularization mean PCI Patients suitable coronary revascularization sort ( balloon angioplasty , deviceassisted balloonangioplasty coronary artery bypass graft ) Women childbearing potential may pregnant desire become pregnant first year follow study procedure . Hence , patient advise use adequate birth control method include 6 month followup . Patients mentally linguistically able understand aim study show sufficient compliance follow study protocol Patients must agree undergo 6 month angiographic followup Patients must agree undergo 1 3 year clinical followup Patient able verbally acknowledge understand associate risk , benefit , treatment alternative therapeutic option trial , e.g. , balloon angioplasty mean Paclitaxeleluting PTCAballoon catheter . The patient , provide informed consent , agree risk benefit state patient inform consent document Patients medical indication followup angiography Reference diameters 2.25 mm 2.8 mm ≤ 22 mm length Diameter stenosis pre procedure must either &gt; 70 % &gt; 50 % ischemia correspond target lesion document either exercise stress ECG , stress echocardiography , scintigraphy The target lesion must cover single Paclitaxeleluting balloon Patients acute ( &lt; 24 h ) recent ( ≤ 48 hour ) myocardial infarction Patients unstable angina pectoris ( Braunwald class 3 ) Patients severe congestive heart failure Patients severe heart failure NYHA IV Patients demonstrate clinical sign cardiogenic shock time procedure ( systolic blood pressure le 80 mm Hg require inotropic support , IABP and/or fluid challenge ) . Women pregnant lactating Patients another coronary stent implant previously target vessel Patients bleed diathesis anticoagulation antiplatelet medication contraindicate Patient participate clinical trial involve investigational device drug Untreated hyperthyroidism Patient presence history severe renal failure ( GFR &lt; 30ml/min ) therefore eligible angiography . Patient 's serum creatinine level must document Post transplantation organ immune suppressive medication Other disease jeopardize followup ( e.g. , malignoma ) Addiction drug alcohol Patients type surgery week precede interventional procedure Evidence extensive thrombosis within target vessel intervention Side branch &gt; 2 mm diameter originate lesion Bifurcate lesion Restenotic lesion Multilesion percutaneous coronary intervention within artery ( main artery ( e.g. , LCdx ) side branch ( e.g. , OMS ) consider different artery ) Percutaneous coronary intervention venous graft Target segment occlude ( i.e. , acute chronic ) Instent restenosis Ostial lesion within 2 mm vessel origin Patient intolerant aspirin and/or ADPantagonists clopidogrel history neutropenia , thrombocytopenia induced ADPantagonists , severe hepatic dysfunction prohibit use clopidogrel</criteria>
