	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PATIENTS : 1 . Patients know , suspected infection susceptibility eligible enrollment . 2 . Patients know suspected infection also eligible order identify microbiologic cause infection , identify extent infection , determine proper course treatment . There limit age , sex , race disability . 3 . Patients must primary physician outside NIH may require submit letter physician document relevant health history . 4 . The patient patient 's guardian willing capable providing inform consent initial counsel clinical staff . Separate consent form interventional procedure obtain explanation specific procedure . 5 . Women childbearing potential , pregnant lactating , may eligible . Interventions pregnant lactate woman minimize much possible risk fetus/infant follow state art evaluation therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect may pregnant participate study , inform study staff primary care physician immediately . 6 . Patients must agree blood tissue store future study immune system and/or medical condition . 7 . Patients may concurrently enrol protocol long Principal Investigator inform . HEALTHY BLOOD RELATIVES OF PATIENTS : 1 . Healthy blood relative patient know suspected infection susceptibility eligible enrollment sick relative enrol protocol patient . 2 . There limit age , sex , race disability . 3 . Relatives minor relative 's guardian must willing capable providing inform consent initial counsel clinical staff . 4 . Participating relative agree blood store future study immune system and/or medical condition . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . A well understood acquire abnormality lead infection susceptibility , HIV , cytotoxic chemotherapy , active malignancy may adequate explanation infection diathesis . These may ground exclusion , opinion investigator , presence disease process interfere significantly evaluation ( applicable patient blood relative ) . 2 . Severe uncommon infection syndrome often require highly specialized team institution . Some referred case able handle appropriately NIH may deem ineligible admission , determine Principal Investigator .</criteria>
