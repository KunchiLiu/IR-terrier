	<detailed_description>Positive treatment effect HBOT report number study , others find demonstrable effect . Studies date evaluate effect variety condition , utilized diverse research method generally await replication . Despite increase usage child autism , preliminary anecdotal report indicate positive outcome , paucity well-controlled study HBOT population , precludes clinician recommend and/or implement evidence-based treatment . It clearly important therefore , evaluate carefully treatment effect HBOT use robust research design population . Hypotheses - Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy associate positive effect symptom autism . - Treatment gain obtain Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy maintain follow-up . Specific Aims - Evaluate effect Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy behavioral cognitive symptom autism , , treatment . - Determine percentage child autism respond positively 80 HBOT treatment cycle extent . - Determine extent observe treatment effect maintain three month HBOT . Study duration : Two week baseline , 10-15 week acute phase , 1- 3-month follow-up . All participant spend one hour per session hyperbaric oxygen chamber , minimum 6 maximum 10 session per week . A total 80 cycle one hour compression must complete within 15 week participant Treatment Group : Pressure Frequency - 1.3 atmosphere absolute ( ATA ) - 24 % oxygen - One session = 1 hour - Total 80 cycle one hour compression must complete within 15 week . Placebo Group : Pressure Frequency - Close ambient air pressure , chamber need enough pressure inflate : 1.05 1.1 atmosphere absolute ( ATA ) - Room Air - One session = 1 hour - Total 80 cycle one hour compression must complete within 15 week .</detailed_description>
