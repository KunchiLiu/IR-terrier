	<brief_summary>This study ass efficacy duration efficacy Botulinum toxin A ( Botox® ) inject lumbar paraspinal muscle reduce pain disability subject suffer chronic low back pain six month duration longer arise identifiable muscle strain injury back trauma . The treatment modality technique use base successful prior 4 month open-labeled pilot study do research group , employ prospective double-blind , randomize , cross-over design control placebo mechanical trigger-point injection effect . Subjects also assess long duration well define duration efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin A Treatment Chronic Lumbar Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred sixty subject randomly assign one four arm ( placebo/placebo , placebo/Botox , Botox/placebo , Botox/Botox ) . In first two phase , randomize subject blindly receive either Botox® ( study arm Botox/placebo Botox/Botox ) placebo ( study arm placebo/placebo placebo/Botox ) injection lumbar paraspinal muscle . The subject assess use validated scale pain disability prior injection monthly thereafter four month . In second phase , second set lumbar injection administer base initial randomization blindly receive either Botox® ( study arm placebo/Botox Botox/Botox ) placebo ( study arm placebo/placebo Botox/placebo ) injection lumbar paraspinal muscle . The subject assess use validated scale pain disability , prior injection monthly thereafter , six month extend monitor period well define limit duration effect . This result half subject crossed-over Botox® placebo ( study arm Botox/placebo ) vice versa ( study arm placebo/Botox ) one quarter subject receive two course either Botox® alone ( Botox/Botox ) placebo alone ( placebo/placebo ) . All subject continue receive medication and/or physiotherapy per standard care treatment record control data analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Active duty military , retired military DoD healthcare beneficiary either sex , age 1870 year , symptom chronic back pain . A clear history identifiable muscle strain back trauma precede chronic pain . Current pain duration &gt; 6 month . MRI affect spine area define potential serious pathology per standard care . Written informed consent write authorization use release health research study information . Normal neurological examination without evidence radiculopathy . VAS score minimum 4 cm reach average 4 cm 10 cm least 4 day week , time entry study Ability follow study instruction likely complete require visit . Negative urine pregnancy test prior administration study medication ( female childbearing potential ) ( applicable ) . Age le 18 great 70 year Concomitant use amino glycoside antibiotic , curarelike agent , agent might interfere neuromuscular function . Any medical condition may put subject increase risk exposure Botulinum Toxin A ( Botox® ) , include diagnose myasthenia gravis , EatonLambert syndrome , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease , neuropathy , renal stone , disorder might interfere neuromuscular function produce similar type back pain . Females pregnant , breastfeeding , plan pregnancy study think may pregnant start study , female childbearing potential unable unwilling use reliable form contraception study . Known allergy sensitivity component study medication . Evidence recent alcohol substance abuse . Known , uncontrolled systemic disease . Participation 30 day precede enrollment duration study another investigational drug device study . Any condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study . Significant Axis I Axis II diagnosis determine neurologist psychiatrist 6 month prior entry study Duration back pain &lt; 6 month . Thoracic cervical spine pain absence low back pain . Anesthetic corticosteroid injection lumbosacral spine within 8 week enrollment . Any anesthetic steroid injection back muscle 4 week prior enrollment . A prior spine MRI CT ( region ) evidence significant pathology spinal cord , root , element spinal column include ; impingement spinal cord nerve root , intrinsic pathology spinal cord ( e.g . syrinx ) nerve root , evidence neoplastic infectious process involve spinal cord nerve root structural element spine ( e.g . vertebra intervertebral disk ) , deformities bony support element spinal column deform spinal cord nerve root . Nonspecific degenerative change spine , Schmorl 's nodule , similar finding impinge upon involve spinal cord nerve root consider exclusionary . Signs radiculopathy neurological examination . History back surgery within one year incomplete resolution back pain due previous surgery ( persistence back pain present prior surgery , i.e . surgical fail back , exclusionary ) . Subjects involve litigation , seek significant disability low back pain , evident secondary gain determine neurologist chart review patient interview . Any previous use Botox® , Dysport® Myobloc® . Previous use Botox Cosmetic Myobloc cosmetic purpose allow last administration occur 6 month prior enrollment inject dose less equal 30 unit ( equivalent dose Myobloc ) . Copies record Botox Cosmetic Myobloc injection ( ) must provide subject prior enrollment verification .</criteria>
