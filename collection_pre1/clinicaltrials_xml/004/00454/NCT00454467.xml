Once device FDA approve , little motivation part developer perform complete post-marketing research , despite importance data public health . Most existent study power compare difference model . The purpose study establish prospective cohort HSS total knee arthroplasty . The creation large prospective joint arthroplasty cohort respond directly initiative propose NIH Consensus Development Conferences Total Knee Replacement . This study allow depth analysis `` Provider Health Care System Perspective '' , ( one important research perspective advocate NIH ) , include surgeon , surgical technique , type prosthesis , implantation technique perioperative care . We able evaluate patient receive arthroplasty surgery HSS , oppose convenience sample , able follow patient life joint replacement . We also able ass patient-level factor affect outcome , include medical socio-demographic characteristic , participation rehabilitation service , extent social support , level patient ' physical activity . The consensus conference emphasize importance evaluating use TJA younger patient , patient underrepresented exist study . For example , one rigorous exist study TKA , patient follow two year surgery . However , three center need recruit 860 TKA patient , whose mean age 70 . By contrast , HSS alone perform 2,000 total knee replacement surgery 2004 , 41 % patient 65 year age , 28 % patient 60 year .</detailed_description>
