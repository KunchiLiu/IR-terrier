	<brief_summary>Most patient differentiate thyroid carcinoma ( DTC ) treat therapeutic dos radioiodine ( 131I ) initial surgery ( total near total thyroidectomy ) , aim destroy microscopic residual normal tumoral thyroid cell facilitate early detection tumor recurrence base serum thyroglobulin ( Tg ) measurement 131I whole body scan ( WBS ) ( 1-5 ) . Recently , preparation patient thyroid ablation rhTSH 3700 MBq 131I l-thyroxine ( l-T4 ) therapy approve Europe European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) alternative thyroid hormone withdrawal ( 6 ) , randomize , control , multicenter study demonstrate method preparation equally effective ( 100 % rate successful ablation ) patient prepared rhTSH receive low total body irradiation experience good quality life compare render hypothyroid ( 7 ) . The present study aim compare efficacy fix activity 1850 MBq versus 3700 MBq 131I post surgical thyroid ablation DTC patient prepared rhTSH ( TSHα , Thyrogen® , Genzyme Therapeutics , Cambridge , MA ) l-T4 therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rhTSH-Thyroid Ablation With 1850 MBq 131I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : Recently , multicenter study differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) patient show 3700 MBq 131I rhTSH stimulation successful post-surgical thyroid ablation rate similar obtain thyroid hormone withdrawal . We investigate whether 1850 MBq 131I rate successful ablation similar 3700 MBq patient prepare rhTSH . Methods : Seventy-two patient DTC randomly assign surgery receive 1850 MBq ( group A , n : 36 ) 3700 MBq ( group B , n : 36 ) 131I rhTSH . The two group comparable age , sex , histotype tumor stage . One injection 0.9 mg rhTSH administer two consecutive day ; 131I therapy deliver 24 hour last injection . A post-therapy whole body scan ( WBS ) perform 72 hour later . Successful ablation assess 6-8 month therapy . Results : Successful ablation , define visible uptake diagnostic WBS rhTSH stimulation , achieve 88.9 % group A group B patient . Basal rhTSH-stimulated serum Tg undetectable ( &lt; 1 ng/ml ) 88.6 % group A 84.8 % group B patient ( p=0.65 ) . Similar rate ablation obtain group also patient lymph node metastasis . Dosimetric data show similar thyroid bed uptake , effective half-life adsorb dose two group . Failure ablate correlate TNM staging , peak TSH level , thyroid bed uptake urinary iodine excretion time ablation , influence absorb dose 131I ( &lt; &gt; 300 Gy ) . Conclusion : Our result demonstrate therapeutic 131I activity 1850 MBq equally effective 3700 MBq thyroid ablation DTC patient prepared rhTSH , even presence lymph node metastasis .</detailed_description>
