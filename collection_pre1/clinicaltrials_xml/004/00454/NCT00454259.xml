	<brief_summary>Exaggerated pain hyperalgesia major issue surgery lead chronic pain . Opioid part pain sensitization process remain absolutely necessary intraoperative period . NMDA receptor antagonist succeed reduce pain sensitization process . Recent study show pain opioid-experienced rat ( POER ) fentanyl ultra low dos induce analgesia , observe naive rat , hyperalgesia . This first demonstration drug induce opposite effect depend individual history . We also observe strong correlation hyperalgesic response POER intensity hyperalgesia develop later , inflammatory surgical pain . The main aim study measure dose effect response fentanyl `` ultra low dos '' human volunteer 's nociceptive threshold , determine opposite response profile reveal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fentanyl Ultra Low Doses Effects Nociceptive Threshold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Principal Objective : `` Evaluate fentanyl `` ultra low dos '' effect human volunteer 's nociceptive threshold depend prior pain opioid experience . '' - Secondary Objective : `` Confirm innocuousness test ( 3 `` ultra low dos '' use trial 10 1,000 fold low low dos use anesthesia analgesia ) find fentanyl ultra low dose could use develop pain sensitisation predictive test . '' - Study design : Bicentric , prospective , randomize , double-blind study . Inclusion criterion : In group : - 18-40 year old male volunteer - weight : 60 85 kg - ASA score : 1 - Informed consent obtain patient - Gender : Male In `` operated '' group : - At least one history peripheral surgery general anesthesia opioid past five year Exclusion criterion : In group : - The patient accept inclusion study - Drug alcohol abuse history - Chronic use analgesic drug history chronic pain - Analgesic opioid consumption within 12hs precede fentanyl placebo injection - Neurological and/or psychiatric disorder , inability give inform consent - Psychological trauma within two year precede inclusion - Any contraindication fentanyl use - Use medication interact fentanyl - Exclusion period national healthy volunteer register - Gender : Female In `` healthy '' group : - Any history general anesthesia surgery - Study plan : comparing two group defer surgical opioid prior experience receive three fentanyl ultra low dos ( 10 1,000 fold low low dos use anesthesia analgesia ) placebo ( cross administration , one week wash period ) . - Number subject : 48</detailed_description>
