	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness 2 different dos modified-release recombinant human thyroid stimulate hormone ( MRrhTSH ) administer radioiodine patient multinodular goiter , condition involve enlargement thyroid gland . We also evaluate safety effectiveness radioiodine therapy alone patient . The goal treatment determine reduction size goiter study goiter symptom improve 6 month 36 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis multinodular goiter , judge clinically ultrasound Screening least 40 mL , less equal 140 mL size . Clinically free thyroid cancer determine Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) dominant and/or highly suspicious cold nodule goiter cytology report negative thyroid cancer . ( Note : Results FNA cytology report perform within 18 month prior commence Screening procedure meet criterion acceptable inclusion ) . Principal Investigator must believe minimal risk coexistent thyroid cancer . Principal Investigator feel patient 's iodine intake and/or level significantly impact result study ( urinary iodine assay Screening lowiodine diet optional associate data collect study purpose ) . Baseline serum level free thyroxine index ( FTI ) within normal range , determined central lab . Baseline serum level thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) range undetectable upper limit normal range , determined central lab . Females childbearing potential must stable hormonal contraceptive regimen ( i.e. , &gt; 6 month continuous use ) and/or use double barrier method ( i.e. , condom foam ) Visit 8 ( i.e . end Core Study ) . Through Visit 8 ( 6 month ) male patient 's participation study , recommend sexual partner ( ) , females childbearing potential , use describe method contraception . Negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential prior participate study . Women age 50 year consider postmenopausal ( define &gt; 2 year since last menstrual period ) need pregnancy test . Routine blood laboratory value within normal range Screening , determine central lab . Abnormal value consider clinically significant Principal Investigator acceptable inclusion . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( 12 lead , 2 minute rhythm strip ) within normal limit Screening determine designate study cardiologist appropriately qualified physician site . Evidence old myocardial infarction ( MI ) exclude patient . Patients ECG finding occasional premature atrial beat , abnormal PR interval associate supra ventricular tachycardia ( SVT ) heart block , right bundle branch block , heart rate ≤ 100 beat per minute ( BPM ) ≥ 50 BPM may include study . Committed follow protocolrequired study procedure evidence provide write informed consent within 21 day prior Screening Period 2 . History thyroid cancer . Previous partial near total thyroidectomy . Clinical history , sign symptom make thyroid cancer high usual probability , positive immediate family history thyroid cancer , history head neck irradiation , stonehard nodule suspicious growth nodule recent month , palpable cervical lymph node nod ultrasound feature suspicious metastasis ( unless rule biopsy FNA ) . During 45 day administration MRrhTSH placebo ( i.e. , Screening Periods 1 2 ) , use propylthiouracil , methimazole thyroxine , vitamins supplement contain kelp iodine ( take multivitamin contain iodine kelp acceptable ) , medication significantly affect iodine handling high dose corticosteroid , high dose diuretic , lithium ( low moderate dose diuretic use acceptable ) . Patient currently within past 60 day use retinoic acid . Serum calcitonin upper limit normal Screening , determine central lab . Use amiodarone within prior 2 year . Received iodinecontaining contrast agent within past 3 month . Inability complete require visit . Patients condition use betablockers medically contraindicate , recently active asthma clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Currently within past 5 year history malignancy , squamous basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix . Prior MI , even remote ; stroke within 6 month ; atrial fibrillation clinically significant arrhythmia within 6 month ( patient may mild hypertension chronic cardiac illness well control medication regimen : blood pressure ( BP ) less 140/90 mmHg rest 5 minute ) . A concurrent major medical disorder ( e.g. , documented significant cardiac disease , debilitate cardiopulmonary disease , advance renal failure , advance liver disease , advance pulmonary disease , advanced cerebral vascular disorder ) may impact capability patient adequately comply requirement study . Women pregnant lactating . A recent history alcoholism , drug abuse disorder might affect compliance protocol . Received investigational study medication within 30 day prior sign inform consent and/or intend participate another clinical study involve use investigational drug course study participation . Patients anticoagulant except aspirin . Patients known time Screening due past test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody positive hepatitis B antigen positive ( screen HIV hepatitis B do study ) . Hyperthyroid symptom scale ( HSS ) ≥ 20 . Patients receive 131I past , lifetime exposure believe &gt; 10 mCi ( 0.37GBq ) 131I . History allergy Thyrogen . Sodium carboxymethylcellulose ( NaCMC ) allergy ( include prior history anaphylaxis follow topical lidocaine , barium sulfate ingestion , intraarticular parenteral corticosteroid ) . Smallest crosssectional area trachea ( SCAT ) discover CT &lt; 60 mm2</criteria>
