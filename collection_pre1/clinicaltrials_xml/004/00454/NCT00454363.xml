	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) ( complete partial response ) GW786034 ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) 800 mg administer orally daily patient advance low intermediate grade carcinoid tumor ( carcinoid cohort ) . II . To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response partial response ) GW786034 800mg administer orally daily patient advance low intermediate grade pancreatic islet cell carcinoma ( islet cell cohort ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) duration GW786034 800mg administer orally daily patient low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma . II . To determine safety tolerability GW786034 800mg administer orally daily patient low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma . III . To explore effect tumor blood flow determine functional compute tomography ( CT ) GW786034 800 mg orally daily patient low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma . IV . To assess trough level GW786034 800 mg orally daily patient low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 90 day 18 month .</detailed_description>
