	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy pazopanib hydrochloride patient stage IV recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma . II . Determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . III . Determine toxicity drug patient . IV . Determine effect drug angiogenesis inhibition use dynamic contrast-enhanced compute tomography ( CT ) scan . V. Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . VI . Correlate effect drug angiogenesis inhibition clinical benefit rate pharmacokinetics . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 12 month .</detailed_description>
