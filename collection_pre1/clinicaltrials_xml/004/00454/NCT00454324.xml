	<brief_summary>This phase II trial abraxane carboplatin extensive stage small cell lung cancer examine overall response rate , time progressive disease , survival time , assessment toxicity profile Carboplatin Abraxane .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Abraxane Carboplatin Treat Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ask study extensive disease small cell lung cancer . All eligible participant agree study receive abraxane carboplatin . The researcher want evaluate activity safety combination abraxane carboplatin , combination help people extensive disease small cell lung cancer . Carboplatin chemotherapy drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat ovarian cancer . It class drug know platinum-containing compound . It slow stops growth cancer cell body . Carboplatin approve FDA use treatment small-cell lung cancer , either alone combined anti-cancer drug . However , carboplatin give paclitaxel standard active treatment patient small cell lung cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , breast cancer , ovarian cancer . Abraxane chemotherapy drug approve FDA treat metastatic breast cancer chemotherapy already try . Abraxane new preparation active ingredient chemotherapy drug , paclitaxel . In study do breast cancer patient , Abraxane compare paclitaxel . Abraxane show effective paclitaxel tumor response tumor progression , addition few side effect paclitaxel . Abraxane show cause less damage person 's white blood cell ( cell fight infection ) cause few allergic reaction ; however , patient develop numbness hand foot . Carboplatin Abraxane intravenous ( IV ) medication . Patients begin treatment 2 cycle ( 1 cycle = 21 day ) abraxane carboplatin . Then disease assessment cycle 2 4 . Patients stable disease , partial response , complete response get additional cycle . Patients progressive disease take study treatment . A maximum 6 cycle give .</detailed_description>
