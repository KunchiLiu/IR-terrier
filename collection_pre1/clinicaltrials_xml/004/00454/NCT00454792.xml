	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Patients With Modic Changes Lumbar Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical experience many patient Modic change relatively severe persistent LBP , typically appear resistant treatment . Furthermore , retrospective study The Backcenter Funen , Ringe , show patient MC fail improve engage physical activity . This unfortunate , typical rehabilitation patient persistent LBP back exercise information keep physically active . This mean relatively large subgroup patient Modic change probably improve rehabilitation tool use today . A randomised control trial therefore design study specific subgroup patient Modic change . In study compare present `` state-of-the art '' rehabilitation approach persistent LBP ( namely exercise keep active ) new concept ( restitution ) . The justification restitution reduce mechanical stress vertebra therefore would allow heel possible micro fracture Modic change .</detailed_description>
