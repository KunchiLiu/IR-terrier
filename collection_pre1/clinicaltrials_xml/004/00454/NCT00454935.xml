	<brief_title>Correlation Between SV2A Expression Tumour Tissue Efficacy Levetiracetam Glioma Patients With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levetiracetam relatively novel anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) , proven effective well tolerate many glioma patient otherwise pharmacoresistant epilepsy . Moreover , levetiracetam neither enzyme-inducing enzyme-inhibiting property , make drug particularly attractive brain tumour patient , frequently receive chemotherapy and/or corticosteroid . Therefore , levetiracetam anti-epileptic drug choice post-operatively glioma patient suffer epilepsy . Unfortunately , even levetiracetam , proportion glioma patient free seizure . It unclear , however , glioma patient benefit levetiracetam treatment . It suggest expression protein SV2A correlate clinical response levetiracetam . The determination SV2A expression brain ( tumour ) tissue might use predictive tool response levetiracetam . Objective study : Correlation SV2A expression surgically remove tumour tumour-surrounding tissue glioma patient suffer epilepsy clinical response levetiracetam .</detailed_description>
