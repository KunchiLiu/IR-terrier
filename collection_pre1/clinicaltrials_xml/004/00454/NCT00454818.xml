	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Genetically Targeted Enzyme Replacement Therapy Advanced Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Heart Association ( AHA ) 2006 update heart disease report 5 million Americans believe symptomatic heart failure ( HF ) , 550,000 patient newly diagnose year . The estimated direct indirect cost HF United States ( U.S. ) 2006 ~ $ 29.6 billion . Heart failure disable chronic disease frequent discharge diagnosis hospitalization among old adult . Despite significant resource expend treatment disease , outcomes remain poor . The five-year survival individual diagnose heart failure le 50 % , end-stage heart failure , one-year survival may low 25 % regardless medical therapy . Recent study suggest fail heart refractory treatment , previously believe . For example , observation small percentage subject leave ventricular assist device ( LVADs ) permanently wean device strongly suggest damage heart capable recover lose function . Clinical study MYDICAR® yet conduct human . Celladon Corporation ( Celladon ) propose investigate gene transfer method restore SERCA2a function heart failure ( HF ) patient use recombinant adeno-associated viral vector ( AAV ) , consist AAV serotype 1 capsid contains human SERCA2a complementary DNA ( cDNA ) flank Inverted Terminal Repeats ( ITR ) derive AAV serotype 2 ( AAV1/SERCA2a ) . MYDICAR® refers AAV1/SERCA2a drug product intend administration percutaneous delivery .</detailed_description>
