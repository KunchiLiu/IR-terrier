	<brief_summary>This prospective , phase IIIb , double-blind randomize trial test effect single dose sildenafil application patient coronary vasospasm compare placebo application . The target variable tested degree coronary vasoconstriction response intracoronary ACh application ( addition clinical chest pain ) image coronary angiography measure use quantitative coronary angiography software . Main objective : Has sildenafil potency inhibit induction coronary vasospasm intracoronary ACh-application patient proven coronary artery spasm ? Secondary objective : Which degree coronary vasospasm inhibition achieve sildenafil ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Effect Sildenafil Patients With Coronary Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery spasm abrupt severe vasoconstrictor response may occur spontaneously normal diseased coronary artery . It may result myocardial ischemia may provoke various stimulus acetylcholine ( ACh ) . Coronary vasospasm involve pathogenesis Prinzmetal 's angina , acute myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death due ventricular arrythmias chest pain symptom associate viral myocarditis . The precise cellular molecular mechanism coronary vasospasm yet elucidate . The often suggested compete explanation disease coronary endothelial dysfunction secondary impair nitric oxide production versus coronary smooth muscle cell hyperreactivity without additional endothelial dysfunction . As precise cellular mechanism currently unknown large group people currently treat appropriately despite use nitrate calcium antagonist . Sildenafil phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) -5 inhibitor approve treatment erectile dysfunction pulmonary hypertension . PDE-5 show also present play important vasomotor role coronary vessel wall . Application inhibitor sildenafil show increase rest coronary artery diameter . Furthermore , atherosclerotic coronary artery segment vasoconstrict follow intracoronary ACh-application vasodilate follow application sildenafil ACh-testing repeat . Other study also suggest improve endothelial function sildenafil application coronary peripheral vasculature . Taken together , sildenafil expect positive effect coronary vasomotility . Whether sildenafil totally prevent occurrence coronary vasospasm least decrease severity vasospasm study far . Thus , aim study analyse possible anti-spastic effect sildenafil patient suffer coronary vasospasm .</detailed_description>
