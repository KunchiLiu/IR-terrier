	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pemetrexed disodium sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Sorafenib may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving pemetrexed disodium together sorafenib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study pemetrexed disodium sorafenib see well work compare pemetrexed disodium alone second-line therapy treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium With Without Sorafenib Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer treat pemetrexed disodium without sorafenib tosylate second-line therapy . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare tumor response rate duration response patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity profile regimens patient . Tertiary - Assess polymorphisms gene expression circulate peripheral mononuclear cell circulate tumor cell pemetrexed disodium target gene gene encode enzyme involve transport , activation , inactivation pemetrexed disodium . - Correlate haplotype-tagged single nucleotide polymorphism gene expression level intracellular level pemetrexed disodium polyglutamates , toxicity , and/or efficacy pemetrexed disodium . - Assess expression polymorphism target gene ( i.e. , TS , DHFR , GARFT ) methylthioadenosine phosphorylase ( antibodies become available ) paraffin-embedded tissue compare result obtain circulate tumor tissue , correlate result response . - Correlate predictive marker hypertension ( e.g . pharmacogenetics , vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] -A , sVEGF receptor-1 , ADMA ) clinical toxicity outcomes . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) North Central Cancer Treatment Group membership . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-21 pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tissue sample collect pharmacokinetic analysis research study . Gene expression assay polymorphism study ( e.g. , use polymerase chain reaction ) circulate peripheral blood mononuclear cell conduct reduced folate carrier , multidrug resistance-associated protein , folate receptor , BCRP , folylpolyglutamate synthase , MTHFR , methionine synthase , methylthioadenosine phosphorylase , TS , dihydrofolate reductase , GARFT , endothelial nitric oxide synthase , angiotensinogen , dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF receptor . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunohistochemistry also conduct . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
