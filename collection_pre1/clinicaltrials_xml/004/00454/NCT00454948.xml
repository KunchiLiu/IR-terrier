Data collect immediately prior participation intervention , within one-month complete intervention six month one year follow-up . Mother 's body mass index ( BMI ) serve primary outcome variable . Multiple 24-hour dietary recall , modify household food inventory physical activity monitoring use secondary index program efficacy . The following hypothesis examine experiment .
