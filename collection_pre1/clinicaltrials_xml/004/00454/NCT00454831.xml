	<detailed_description>Chitosan natural product produce commercially deacetylation chitin , find exoskeleton crustacean . It suggest chitosan lipid-lowering effect bind fatty acid cholesterol gastrointestinal tract restrict absorption . This study design determine HEP-40 chitosan ( Enzymatic Polychitosamine Hydrolysate - 40kDa ) , short-chained chitosan molecular weight 40 kDa , safe effective lower LDL-cholesterol level patient previously treat lipid-lowering agent cholesterol level mild moderately level recommend National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III ( NCEP ATP III ) guideline . This multi-centre , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Following 4-week Pre-Randomization Phase patient instruct maintain stable diet , patient randomize one follow study group 12-week Active Treatment Phase : - HEP-40 400 mg three time day ( 400 mg TID ) - HEP-40 800 mg twice day ( 800 mg BID ) - HEP-40 800 mg three time day ( 800 mg TID ) - HEP-40 2400 mg day ( 2400 mg QD ) - Placebo , three time day ( placebo ) The primary objective evaluate clinical benefit administer HEP-40 chitosan different dos different dose regimen compare placebo . Clinical benefit define reduction LDL-cholesterol 4 week active treatment .</detailed_description>
