Effective contraception must continue least 30 day treatment discontinuation ; Has history suspect documented Type I hypersensitivity reaction ( e.g . anaphylactic anaphylactoid shock , respiratory distress bronchospasm rash ) glycopeptides ( vancomycin teicoplanin ) , aminoglycosides , blactams cephalosporin Has renal dysfunction require dialysis ; Has neutropenia associate syndrome generally think associate high risk bacterial infection ( e.g. , chronic benign neutropenia ) ; Is blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia ; Has know underlie immunocompromising disease likely interfere evaluation therapeutic response , infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ; Had isolation identification specific pathogen suspect responsible fever ; Has document colonization vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium Enterococcus faecalis Had receive one dose systemic ( whether oral parenteral ) antibiotic within 3 calendar day precede initial therapy episode fever ; Has receive oral vancomycin prophylaxis Grampositive infection ; Requires addition antiviral , antianaerobic antifungal coverage time study medication ; however , antiviral antifungal prophylaxis allow , provide start time study medication . Has suspect , invasive fungal disease ( e.g . image necrotic pneumonia ) , perirectal infection , liver abscess , necrotizing enterocolitis ( typhlitis ) . Had negative serum urine laboratory pregnancy test ( woman except postmenopausal surgically sterilize ) . The patient one following : Leukemia , lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease , solid tumor undergo bone marrow transplantation ( reason ) Had neutropenia time initiation initial empiric antibiotic therapy , define &lt; 500 neutrophils/mm3 blood ; Â³500 &lt; 1,000 neutrophils/mm3 expect fall 500 neutrophils/mm3 within 48 hour . Has least one follow condition : clinically obvious , serious catheterrelated infection . For patient document catheterrelated infection due organism coagulase negative staphylococci , catheter remove within 24 hour identification ( removal guidewire permit ) . Intensive chemotherapy produce substantial mucosal damage ( i.e. , highdose cytarabine ( &gt; 1 g/m2/day , increase risk penicillin resistant streptococcal infection , particularly due viridans streptococci ) ; prophylaxis quinolones onset febrile episode ; know colonization pneumococcus resistant penicillin cephalosporin methicillinresistant S. aureus ; blood culture positive grampositive bacteria final identification susceptibility</criteria>
