	<brief_title>Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( CABG ) Off On Pump Revascularization Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale purpose study : Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery prolongs life-expectancy patient severe ischemic heart disease , especially leave main , triple vessel disease single/double vessel disease stenosis proximal leave anterior descending ( LAD ) artery . The perioperative mortality 2 % additional 5 % 7 % suffer complication myocardial infarction , stroke , renal failure , etc . The technique operate beat heart ( off-pump ) coronary artery bypass graft surgery recently develop past year effort decrease perioperative complication typically related cardiopulmonary bypass associate on-pump CABG . While registry suggest off-pump CABG may superior , data fully control difference patient characteristic , influence patient selection specific procedure . The benefit off-pump CABG compare conventional on-pump CABG unclear . The investigator therefore propose large simple , international multicentre randomize control trial definitively evaluate efficacy safety off-pump CABG treatment patient undergo coronary artery surgery fund CIHR , pilot study preliminary step towards full trial . Sample size : The investigator examine outcomes Canadian off-pump CABG Registry identify group patient represent high risk cardiovascular event . Utilizing inclusion criterion describe , group patient accumulate vast majority outcome Registry represent 50 % patient Registry , therefore minimize sample size still representative . The cumulative event rate 30 day ( first co-primary outcome ) on-pump CABG estimate 8.6 % investigator expect 33 % relative risk reduction ( RRR ) off-pump CABG group . The sample calculate whole trial 4700 patient . Design/Methodology : Trial design : This pilot randomize control trial compare off-pump CABG versus on-pump CABG 60 patient undergoing isolated CABG . Interventions : Patients eligible CABG randomize receive either Off-pump CABG surgery On-pump CABG surgery . Randomization : After obtain informed write consent patient allocate either off-pump CABG on-pump CABG call 24-hour randomization telephone number . An expertise-based randomization use wherein surgeon expert Off-pump surgery operate patient randomize receive Off-pump surgery . Patients randomized receive On-pump CABG operate surgeon expert on-pump CABG surgery . To minimize bias stratify block randomization use . For pilot study randomization stratify 3 centre random block 4 6 . The data adjudicator blind study . Due nature intervention , operate surgeon , anesthetist , perfusionist , operation room staff , intensive-care unit staff blind study . Setting : Patients either see emergency , outpatient ICU diagnose single , double triple coronary artery occlusion require isolate CABG . Study intervention : Interventions : Patients eligible CABG randomize receive either Off-pump CABG surgery On-pump CABG surgery . A surgeon expert assign technique perform procedure . Primary outcome : - The occurrence composite total mortality , stroke , nonfatal MI , new renal failure 30 day post CABG surgery AND - The occurrence composite total mortality , stroke , nonfatal MI , new renal failure , repeat coronary revascularization ( i.e . coronary artery bypass surgery percutaneous coronary intervention ) 5 year randomization . The secondary outcome - The assessment total cost resource consumption 30 day CABG surgery AND - The assessment total cost resource consumption 5 year CABG surgery Measurements : The investigator ascertain event interest periodic regular follow-up utilizing standardized definition event , appropriate support document obtain centrally . - CV death : death consider cardiovascular unless specific non-cardiovascular cause evident ( e.g . malignancy ) . - Stroke : new acute focal neurological deficit ( except subarachnoid hemorrhage may focal ) think vascular origin sign symptom last great 24 hour . - MI perioperative ( within 24 hour surgery ) : new pathologic Q wave document new wall motion abnormality septal OR cardiac marker ³ 10 x ULN . - MI non-perioperative ( later 24 hour surgery ) : ECG change consistent infarction ( new significant Q wave two contiguous lead absence previous LVH conduction abnormality ) evolve ST-segment T-wave change two contiguous lead new left bundle branch block ST segment elevation require thrombolysis PCI AND cardiac marker ( troponins CKMB ) necrosis range . Post-PCI MI include non-perioperative MI group define new pathologic Q wave document new wall motion abnormality septal OR cardiac marker ³ 3 x ULN within 24 hour PCI . - Renal failure : doubling serum creatinine pre-op baseline requirement renal replacement therapy ( eg , dialysis , continuous hemofiltration , renal transplant ) . Hemofiltration dialysis cardio-pulmonary bypass constitute requirement renal replacement therapy . Patients receive dialysis within 1 month surgery eligible endpoint . - Repeated coronary revascularization : new CABG procedure PCI associate document ischemia stress test ( ECG , ECHO , nuclear ) AND graft failure new culprit lesion ( ³ 70 % luminal stenosis ) . For endpoint , investigator define : - Recurrence angina : new chronic onset typical chest pain document ischemia stress test ( ECG , ECHO , nuclear ) . - Blood transfusion : blood bank product transfuse within 24 hour CABG surgery . - Total mortality : cause mortality Plan data analysis : The intention treat principle , participant include assigned treatment group regardless adherence , guide analysis . In principle analysis , time first occurrence one component cluster ( cardiac death , stroke , nonfatal MI , new renal failure ) present Kaplan-Meier survival curve comparison two treatment group perform log-rank test . The treatment effect measure hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval derive Cox proportional hazard model . The investigator also calculate absolute risk reduction associate 95 % confidence interval , well number need treat ( NNT ) off-pump CABG prevent one major cardiovascular event . Participants prematurely discontinue follow-up major cardiovascular event censor last follow-up data ; number expect &lt; 1 % give relatively short period follow-up surgery . In secondary analysis investigator determine compare incidence major cardiovascular event ( cardiac death , stroke , nonfatal MI , new renal dialysis ) revascularization procedure ( i.e . coronary artery bypass surgery percutaneous coronary intervention ) use strategy . The effect two operative technique different sub-groups ( i.e . patient diabetes , renal failure , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular disease , well patient leave ventricular function , gender age conduct stratified analysis Cox proportional hazard model . The test interaction subgroup factor treatment group do include product term model already contain treatment subgroup factor . The length hospital stay length ICU/CCU stay compare use student 's t-test . An event adjudication committee ( blind surgical allocation ) centrally review suspected major outcome list . The investigator also subgroup analysis different sub-groups ( i.e . patient diabetes , renal failure , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular disease , well patient leave ventricular function , gender age examine consistency coherence )</detailed_description>
