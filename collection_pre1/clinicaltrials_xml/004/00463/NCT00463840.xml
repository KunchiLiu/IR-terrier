	<brief_title>Chemoradiation With Oxaliplatin Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate neoadjuvant chemoradiation lead improve survival portion patient proceed resection . This trial incorporate similar trial structure use new agent patient present locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer . Specifically oxaliplatin use owe great activity comparison cisplatin favorable therapeutic index combination radiation compare gemcitabine . In summary , primary outcome measure phase I portion trial determine maximum tolerate dose combination . Following determination dose , phase II portion trial characterize toxicity regimen well evaluate long-term efficacy .</detailed_description>
