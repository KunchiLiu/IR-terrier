	<brief_title>Effect Interferon Beta-1a ( Avonex® ) Changes Non-Conventional MRI Measures Patients With MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.1 . Protocol Title : Effect Interferon beta-1a ( Avonex® ) change non-conventional MRI measure patient relapsing-remitting secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis . 1.2 . Study rationale : Only longitudinal study investigate effect disease-modifying ( DMT ) annual change non-conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure , magnetization transfer imaging ( MTI ) patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . In previous study , effect interferon beta-1a ( Avonex® ) administer IM week investigate evolution monthly magnetization transfer ratio ( MTR ) within new gadolinium ( Gd ) -enhancing lesion patient early relapsing-remitting ( RR ) MS . Eight untreated patient RRMS complete 14 monthly brain MRI session elect initiate treatment Avonex® . The difference MTR appearance 47 new Gd+ lesion treatment versus 23 new Gd+ lesion treatment Avonex® significant . However , appearance new Gd+ lesion , rate increase MTR ( index remyelination ) faster therapy ( p = 0.037 ) . This study indicate MTR abnormality within new Gd+ lesion may evolve slow rate treatment Avonex® initiate therapy Avonex® may promote resolution new Gd+ lesion . However , although study yield positive result , empower establish whether Avonex® may real treatment effect lesion recovery . Moreover , study , effect Avonex® investigate change normal appear brain tissue ( NABT ) time . 1.3 . Study Aims : Aim 1 . To define effect interferon beta-1 ( Avonex® ) monotherapy ( 6.0 MIU administer i.m . week ) year-to-year change two annual measures—MTI diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) —in patient either RR secondary-progressive ( SP ) MS . Aim 2 . To explore difference progression two non-conventional MRI measure patient develop significant brain atrophy , hyperintense T2- hypointense T1 ( black hole ) lesion volume ( LV ) progression 12 month . Aim 3 . To investigate difference progression non-conventional MRI measure patient respond respond Avonex® monotherapy 12 month . 1.4 . Design Methods : 1.4.1 . Study outline : Phase IV open label , single-blind study , post-marketing , 1-year MRI observational study evaluate effect Avonex® monotherapy ( 6.0 MIU administer i.m . week ) year-to-year change two annual measures—MTI DWI—in patient either RR SP MS. One hundred fifty ( 150 ) patient RR SP MS—followed Jacobs Neurological Institute , University Buffalo , Buffalo NY—who satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion treat Avonex® monotherapy . They assess baseline 12 month MRI clinical examination . These patient part large cohort MS patient ( 1000 ) Avonex® mono- combination therapy routinely follow Jacobs Neurological Institute . MRI assessment include detailed conventional non-conventional protocol . Neurological assessment include Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score evaluation relapse . 1.4.2 . Outcome measure : The primary outcome study measure effect Avonex® monotherapy change lesional MTR , whole brain ( WB ) MTR , normal appear GM ( NAGM ) MTR normal appear WM ( NAWM ) MTR , well WB mean diffusivity ( MD ) entropy , measure 1-year change baseline . The secondary outcome include measurement brain parenchymal fraction ( BPF ) , GM fraction ( GMF ) , WM fraction ( WMF ) , T1- T2- ( LV ) , number volume Gd-enhancing lesion evaluation annual relapse rate EDSS .</detailed_description>
