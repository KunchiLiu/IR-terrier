	<brief_summary>High-dose chemotherapy autologous stem-cell transplantation establish role treatment aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) refractory first line chemotherapy relapse . The PARMA study randomize 109 patient , chemo-sensitive relapse marrow involvement receive , follow initial salvage regimen , high-dose chemotherapy versus continuous standard dose chemotherapy . 5-year progression-free survival 46 % transplant group compare 12 % chemotherapy group . Results significantly inferior patient multiply relapse chemo-refractory disease 0-20 % patient achieve long-term disease control autologous transplantation . Thus large proportion patient refractory relapse disease cure currently available transplantation method newer approach require . Rituximab first monoclonal antibody approve clinical use . It anti CD20 antibody high response rate treatment follicular lymphoma increase response rate aggressive lymphoma combine chemotherapy . It well tolerate minimal side effect . However tumor may escape rituximab sensitivity loss antigen , poor access antibody bulky poorly vascularize tumor , failure host effector eliminate antibody bind tumor cell . Lymphoma cell inherently exquisitely sensitive radiation . Radioimmunotherapy use monoclonal antibody conjugate radioactive isotope target radiation directly tumor cell . Ibritumomab parent murine anti CD20 antibody witch target epitope rituximab . Tiuxetan chelator covalently link antibody chelate isotope 90Yttrium form active radioconjugate Zevalin . 90Yttrium pure high-energy beta emitter relatively short half time ( 64 hour ) path length 5 mm . These property make ideal isotope radioimmmunotherapy . The high energy long beta path advantageous treat bulky , poorly vascularize tumor , tumor heterogeneous antigen expression neighbor tumor cell hit cross fire tumor bind radioconjugate . Pure beta emission limit radiation patient body safe surround allow simple outpatient care , need patient isolation shield . Biodistribution predictable , eliminate need dosimetry . Initial study show Zevalin favorable toxicity profile effective rituximab patient follicular transform non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , study currently perform aggressive lymphoma . There initial phase I-II study combine radioimmunotherapy high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem-cell transplantation promising result . We conduct phase II study fixed-dose Zevalin 0.4 mCi/kg BEAM high-dose chemotherapy patient chemo-refractory disease . So far , 23 patient include . With median follow-up 17 month estimate progression-free survival 52 % compare 0-20 % expect patient multiply relapse chemo-refractory disease . Based data data group expect addition Zevalin standard high-dose chemotherapy improve transplantation outcome patient standard-risk chemosensitive disease , well . This study randomize patient Zevalin-BEAM versus BEAM alone determine potential Zevalin radioimmunotherapy improve outcome autologous stem-cell transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients CD20 positive aggressive nonHodgkin 's lymphoma , either diffuse large Bcell transform follicular lymphoma confirm pathological biopsy report . 2 . Patients candidate stemcell transplantation due refractory disease first line chemotherapy relapse disease comply standard transplant eligibility criterion . 3 . Patients must chemosensitive disease achieve least partial response salvage chemotherapy . 4 . Patients give 2 line therapy , initial treatment one salvage treatment . Local radiation therapy consolidation consider line therapy . 5 . Age less physiologic 65 year . 6 . Patients adequate autologous stem cell collection transplantation ( &gt; 2.5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg ) . Backup collection preferable obligatory . 7 . Patients must sign write informed consent . 8 . Adequate birth control fertile patient . 9 . All prior chemotherapy complete least three week study treatment 1 . Chemorefractory disease 2 prior therapy 2 .
