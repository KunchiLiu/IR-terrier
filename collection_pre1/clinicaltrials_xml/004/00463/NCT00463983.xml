	<brief_summary>Octreotide somatostatin analog long half-life vivo . Octreotide interest anti-inflammatory anti-fibrotic property vitro vivo . Somatostatin receptor increase Octreotide uptake increase lung patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Our hypothesis octreotide may slow degradation lung function patient IPF . In proof concept study , patient IPF receive intramuscular injection slow release octreotide ( Sandostatin LP , 30 mg ) every 4 week 48 week . Lung function ( FVC , DLCO ) , HRCT score fibrosis ground glass , 6 minute walk test , quality life survival monitor .</brief_summary>
