	<brief_summary>Cancer second lead cause death United States , approximately 90 % death result patient metastatic spread . Save notable exception testicular cancer , chemotherapy alone cure patient metastasis . Some patient limit metastatic deposit ( commonly colon cancer spread liver ) cure surgery follow chemotherapy . Therefore , patient metastasis consider aggressive local therapy ( surgery and/or radiation ) . Even though chemotherapy improve significantly , patient treat conventional chemotherapy and/or biologically target therapy cured disease . For common type cancer , chemotherapy alone shrink stabilize tumor average 6 month tumor regrow . Both chemotherapy biologically target therapy major limitation prevent cure patient . Radiation therapy effective modality treat cancer . Until recently , radiation metastasis use relieve symptom result local tumor growth . Technological advance , include stereotactic radiotherapy , allow radiation precisely deliver tumor spar nearby normal organ . Stereotactic radiotherapy completely eradicate local tumor minimal side effect . Stereotactic radiotherapy never combine drug therapy . Sutent new F.D.A . approve cancer therapy target tumor blood vessel . It effective two type cancer rarely respond chemotherapy ( GI stromal tumor kidney cancer ) . We propose combine biologically target drug therapy physically target stereotactic radiotherapy . Our goal determine safe regimen best method combine treatment . Ultimately , goal cure patient previously incurable metastatic cancer combination .</brief_summary>
