	<detailed_description>The experimental design Phase I safety trial subject VA Salt Lake City Health Care System present CAD associate depressed LV function require myocardial surgical revascularization eligible enrollment . Patients enrol study receive autologous BM-MNC adjunct CABG . The primary outcome measure safety measure incidence postoperative Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) Adverse Events ( AE ) . The secondary outcome measure LV function , myocardial perfusion , clinical improvement . The trial one experiment one patient group . Group 1 ( n=15 ) follow standard Phase I dose escalation curve magnitude 0.5 log increase every third patient . Dose escalation continue dosage 1 x108 cells/pt reach maximum tolerated dose equivalent ( MTDE ) identify . Cellular therapeutic product BM-MNCS posse pharmacologic profile small molecule drug , thus , posse predictable metabolic activity metabolite production , traditional pharmaceutical . This make identity maximum tolerate dose somewhat difficult . We therefore use term MTDE instead MTD indicate cell dosage consistent clinical morbidity beyond obvious clinical benefit . The characteristic identify MTDE could adverse event felt relate actual cell dosage escalation . Although unlikely , MTDE event could include microembolic phenomenon , hematoma injection site , obvious myocardial congestion ischemia injection site .</detailed_description>
