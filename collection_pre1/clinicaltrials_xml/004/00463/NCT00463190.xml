	<brief_summary>Probiotic bacteria inhabit gastrointestinal tract healthy individual may improve health status patient digestive disease . The first aim study seek determine probiotic medication ( Bio-Three ) inhibit gastrointestinal infection reduce inflammatory response intestine . The second aim explore bacterial count ( microbiology ) subsequent immune response probiotic inhibition enterocolitis child . We try seek gain advance understanding probiotic versus pathogenic microorganism host interaction , mucosal immune response probiotic intestine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Probiotics ( Bio-Three ) Children 's Enterocolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Viral infection lead cause diarrhea childhood . Rotavirus common virus cause diarrhea among child worldwide . Probiotics consider beneficial management prevention viral diarrhea . Saavedra et al . report feeding infant formula Streptococcus thermophilus Bifidobacterium bifidum reduce incidence diarrhea rotavirus shed infant . Another study suggest child receive bifidobacteria-supplemented milk-based formula may protective symptomatic rotavirus infection . Several pathogen , Salmonella spp. , enteropathogenic Escherichia coli enterohemorrhagic E. coli spp. , Campylobacter spp. , Shigella spp. , cause invasive diarrhea . These pathogen capacity invade mucosa distal small intestine colon , stimulate local systemic inflammatory response , sometimes cause hemorrhage ulceration mucosa . Some strain invasive bacteria induce intestinal cellular damage also enter systemic circulation affect distal organ . Probiotics show effective treatment condition . There many mechanism probiotic enhance intestinal health , include stimulation immunity , competition limit nutrient , inhibition epithelial mucosal adherence , inhibition epithelial invasion production antimicrobial substance . Clostridium butyricum effective treatment prophylaxis antibiotic-associated diarrhea child , normalize intestinal flora disturb antibiotic . Probiotics ( Bacillus mesentericus ) affect intestinal bacterial flora increase anaerobic bacteria decrease population potentially pathogenic microorganism . A decrease luminal endotoxin may result less endotoxin translocation bacterial translocation . The effect Bio-Three ( Enterococcus T-110 , C. butyricum TO-A , B. mesentericus TO-A ) ever prove ( ) normalization enterobacterial flora , ( b ) improvement grow ability live bacteria drug , ( c ) inhibition pathogenic bacteria , ( ) promotion growth beneficial bacteria . Despite gastrointestinal effect , Bio-three therapy also effective clinical bacteriological response genital tract infection publish literature .</detailed_description>
