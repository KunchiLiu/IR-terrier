	<brief_summary>Chronic , unexplained pain symptom common layer population , largely unknown cause . This study examine hypothesis patient pain symptoms process pain abnormally brain . TO aim , compare patient healthy people : receive mild pain painful body region another location . Concurrently , measure brain activity brain scan ( functional MRI scan ) . With study result , want increase understanding cause chronic , unexplained pain symptom , order find good method diagnose treating .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Augmented Cerebral Pain Processing Chronic , Unexplained Pain : fMRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic , unexplained pain heterogeneously define , common recur clinical problem , general medical practice well specialist care . Chronic , unexplained pain cause considerable loss quality life , frequent absence work common reason health care visit . From pathophysiological point view , augment self-amplifying sensitivity physical signal pain ( well signal ) seem important . This refer 'generalised hypervigilance ' , specific type sensitisation . Central sensitisation mechanism imply several pain syndrome . In psychophysical pilot study , confirm existence amplify pain perception chronic , unexplained pain , well disturbed influence attentional process . Our study result probably reflect general disturbance perception , associate specific body location . This general perceptual disturbance express strong fashion clinically affect body region . Abnormal pattern cerebral pain processing find functional MRI study syndromes unknown origin , fibromyalgia , somatoform pain disorder irritable bowel syndrome . However , role several neurobiological factor chronic , unexplained pain remain elucidated place context biopsychosocial model . Work plan : A 3T rapid event-related , Functional MRI-experiment cerebral processing experimental pain stimulus chronic , unexplained pain-patients versus healthy control . Twelve chronic , unexplained pain-patients unilateral limb pain twelve healthy control subject experience painful non-painful electrical stimulus painful limb , whilst attentional state subject control . With functional MRI , record pain-related cerebral activation compare group , order characterise cerebral correlate alter pain processing chronic , unexplained pain .</detailed_description>
