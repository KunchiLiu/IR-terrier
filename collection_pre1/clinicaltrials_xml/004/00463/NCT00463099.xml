	<brief_title>Multicenter Orthopaedics Outcomes Network ACL Reconstructions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disruption anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) among frequent musculoskeletal injury affect physically active men woman . An estimated 200,000 ACL reconstruction ( ACLR ) perform annually , incidence injury roughly 1 3000 per year . ACL injury immediate long-term implication injure person 's quality life , risk osteoarthritis ( OA ) , long-term disability . Currently , ACLR recommend standard care follow ACL tear base evidence improve instrumented laxity , desire return sport play , evidence reduction future knee injury . In research propose identify risk factor measurable time injury/surgery order estimate magnitude effect factor important quality life clinical outcome ( e.g. , OA incidence additional surgery ) 2 10 year patient 's ACL reconstruction . AIM 1 . To identify risk factor reduce quality life 2-10 yrs post-ACLR , information available time surgery ; include characteristic patient ( age , gender , body mass index , activity level , clinical knee alignment ) injury ( concurrent meniscus , articular cartilage , collateral ligament injury ) , treatment decision make initial surgery ( e.g. , graft choice , meniscus articular cartilage treatment ) . AIM 2 . To identify risk factor symptoms sign osteoarthritis 2-10 year post-ACLR , information available time surgery ; include characteristic patient ( ) injury ( ) , treatment decision make ACLR ( ) . AIM 3 . To identify risk factor recurrent ligament disruption additional arthroscopic knee surgery ACLR knee , among characteristic patient ( ) , initial injury ( ) , treatment decision make ACLR ( ) . The overarch goal study establish evidence-based medicine practice counsel patient prognosis , guide surgeon treatment meniscus articular cartilage injury , post-surgical care , well appropriate evidence future interventional trial target subset ACLRs poorer outcome .</detailed_description>
