	<detailed_description>The propose study entail comprehensive evaluation effect acute dos nAChR allosteric modulator galantamine hydrochloride ( 0 , 4 8 mg ) neurocognitive measure schizophrenic smoker ( n=20 ) schizophrenic non-smokers ( n=10 ) human laboratory paradigm . After train battery neurocognitive assessment , subject study three separate test week complete neurocognitive batter baseline , acute administration three dos galantamine counterbalance order across subject experimental group . Specifically , smoker would randomize one two group : 1 ) undergo overnight smoking abstinence prior study cognitive session order determine galantamine 's effect abstinence-induced cognitive impairment , 2 ) may smoke usual prior study cognitive session . The inclusion nonsmoker allow assessment galantamine 's effect cognitive deficit schizophrenia independent cigarette smoking . Finally , genetic variation key metabolic gene involve catecholamine metabolism ( COMT DBH ) would evaluate determinant galantamine-related improvement cognitive performance schizophrenic smoker nonsmoker . We predict galantamine dose-dependently improve select cognitive deficit associate schizophrenia ( e.g. , spatial work memory , sustain attention prepulse inhibition ) previously show selectively improve cigarette smoke smoker schizophrenia [ 18 ] , effect would pronounce nonsmoker schizophrenia . If result positive , would support rationale control clinical trial use nAChR agonist like galantamine treat select domain cognitive dysfunction disorder . Study Design : The following experimental group study : 1 . Schizophrenic Smokers abstinence condition ( n=10 ) 2 . Schizophrenic Smokers smoke condition . ( n=10 ) 3 . Schizophrenic Nonsmokers ( n=10 ) Three acute dos galantamine ( GAL ) test ( 0 , 4 8 mg ) subject three separate test session separate least 3 day , study medication dos across sequential subject give randomize , counterbalance manner . Smokers ( n=20 ) nonsmoker ( n=10 ) schizophrenia recruit outpatient division The Connecticut Mental Health Center ( CMHC ) New Haven , CT , 's affiliate satellite center ( Hispanic Clinic , West Haven Mental Health Center , Yale Behavioral Mental Health Center ) . Screening Procedures : All potential subject would meet study staff 2-3 intake evaluation session determine study eligibility , would typically take place within 4 week study enrollment . A description evaluation measure give : The screen evaluation include completion inform consent form , urine toxicology screen screen recent use illegal substance , urine pregnancy test female subject , psychiatric evaluation use SCID DSM-IV disorder , PANSS , AIMS , Webster , Barnes , BDI , Tiffany Questionnaire Smoking Urges ( T-QSU ) , Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale ( M-NWS ) , Shipley Full Scale Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) , blood draw plasma nicotine , plasma cotinine , well CBC LFT 's , physical examination conduct Dr. George . Subjects separately consent genetics portion study blood take genotyping purpose . Finally , pre-study neuropsychological testing session would perform order orient train participant laboratory procedure . Subjects pregnant plan become pregnant eligible participate . We compensate subject complete screen evaluation process ( $ 25.00 ) neurocognitive training session ( $ 25.00 ) total $ 50.00 . In addition , subject would pay $ 25.00 donate blood sample genotyping . Blood genotyping obtain COMT DBH polymorphisms smoker nonsmoker schizophrenia participate study . The genotyping study do collaboration Psychiatric Genetics laboratory Joseph F. Cubells , M.D. , Ph.D. Emory University . Experimental Procedures : Smokers test cognitive battery baseline ( Day 1 , periodic smoking break minimize nicotine withdrawal ) , 24 hour later overnight smoke abstinence ( Day 2 ) . Non-smokers tested baseline ( Day 1 ) 24 hour later ( Day 2 ) . Study medication give single dose Day 2 session produce ascend plasma drug level ( t= ½ 5/7 h ) two hour test session , counterbalance dose schedule galantamine hydrobromide ( 0 , 4 , 8 mg ) within test group . If systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg , galantamine study medication hold . Before session ( Day 1 Day 2 ) , clinical rating use PANSS , HDRS , extrapyramidal rating , adverse event rating would complete . For smoker , pre-session tobacco crave withdrawal rating , expire breath carbon monoxide , plasma cotinine nicotine level would obtain . Smokers randomize abstinence condition would receive $ 150.00 successful completion subsequent three test session procedure require overnight abstinence ( $ 50.00 successful abstinence , $ 100.00 subsequent test session completion ) . Smokers randomize non-abstinence condition would also receive $ 150.00 successful completion three test session procedure order maintain consistency . Nonsmokers would receive $ 100.00 completion three test session beyond training session . In addition , completion bonus $ 50.00 pay subject complete study procedure . Thus , smoker schizophrenia could earn $ 575.00 , nonsmoker $ 425.00 completion entire study . The propose single subject timeline give :</detailed_description>
