	<brief_summary>Major depression increasingly recognize chronic highly recurrent condition , result significantly increase health problem . One possible mechanism may contribute treatment resistance increase production release chemical call proinflammatory cytokine patient major depression . These chemical mediate body 's response infectious agent like bacteria show increased psychological stress . They produce symptom associate sick , include fever , malaise change sleep appetite . Several line evidence indicate proinflammatory cytokine may contribute development major depression may thus represent novel target pharmacological treatment disorder . The TNF-alpha antagonist , Infliximab ( Remicade® ) , infusion style drug approve FDA treatment inflammatory condition like Crohns disease rheumatoid arthritis . We conduct study see infliximab ( Remicade® ) effective placebo acutely reduce symptom depression patient elevate proinflammatory marker respond , unable tolerate , least two previous treatment current depressive episode . Proinflammatory marker measure simple blood test C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) level body . After appropriate screening determine eligibility , 64 subject treatment resistant depression randomize receive three infusion either infliximab ( Remicade® ) placebo ( salt water ) Emory Infliximab Infusion Center Division Digestive Diseases , Emory University School Medicine . Subjects follow 12 week evaluation week 0 ( baseline ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 . The first infliximab ( Remicade® ) infusion occur first ( Baseline ) visit . The second infusion occur Study Week 2 ( third visit ) . The third infusion occur Study Week 6 ( Visit 6 ) . The choice three infusion , infusion schedule , base current recommendation use infliximab ( Remicade® ) condition receive FDA approval . Subjects evaluate twelve week train clinician change depression symptom improvement quality life . In addition , physician evaluate subject visit make sure remain healthy . Blood withdrawn baseline prior infusion subsequent visit check labs safety also evaluate potential relationship change inflammatory activity therapeutic response . After Study Week 12 , participant monitor phone , every 4 week 22-Week Post Study Follow-up Phase assess physical psychiatric symptom period follow final infusion . At baseline Week 8 visit , subject admit Atlanta Clinical Translational Science Institute ( ACTSI ) , research unit Emory Hospital , extend evaluation . The purpose come ACTSI researcher evaluate whether treatment infliximab improve endocrine function , inflammation , sleep thinking ability people depress . For visit ( Week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 12 ) , participant come office visit Winship Cancer Institute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Infliximab Treatment Resistant Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression become health crisis epidemic proportion modern world . The prevalence major depression rise last several generation every country examine , age symptom onset decrease . Currently fourth lead health burden worldwide , major depression rank second cardiac disease cause international medical morbidity year 2020 . One six individual United States experience episode major depression lifetime , risk subsequent episode rise dramatically person depress . Indeed , depression recognize highly chronic recurrent illness . On average , patient major depression symptomatic 60 % time , even receive community-standard antidepressant treatment . Recent estimate place economic burden depression United States 83 billion dollar year . Depression associate great disability chronic illness risk factor mortality . Suicide rank among top ten cause death United States , best estimate suggest 60-70 % people kill clinically depress . Between 10-15 % severely depressed people eventually commit suicide . In addition , many study indicate depression significantly increase all-cause mortality independently suicide . Depression predict later development number medical condition , include cardiac cerebrovascular disease , hypertension , diabetes , obesity metabolic syndrome , dementia , cancer . Depression also markedly increase mortality patient medically ill associate decreased response pharmacological treatment cancer hepatitis C. Unfortunately , patient depression experience complete resolution symptom antidepressant treatment 10-20 % patient refractory currently available modality , include electroconvulsive shock ( ECT ) therapy . ECT often effective patient fail adequate trial multiple antidepressant , associate risk anesthesia significant short term memory impairment . Responses ECT short-lived , many patient respond subsequently relapse , even maintenance antidepressant . In addition efficacy issue , many patient unable tolerate side effect associate antidepressant ECT . The risk respond ( tolerate ) treatment highlight recent study document partial—but incomplete—response associate increase risk full symptomatic relapse ( even therapy ) bad long term disease course , well significantly impair quality life . Treatment resistance also result six time increase direct health care costs.35 These factor highlight tremendous need identify novel treatment strategy , especially depressed patient unresponsive conventional therapy . One possible mechanism may contribute treatment resistance increase proinflammatory cytokine production release . Several line evidence indicate proinflammatory cytokine participate pathophysiology major depression may thus represent novel target pharmacological treatment disorder . First , high percentage patient receive cytokine therapy ( interferon-alpha malignant melanoma hepatitis C infection ) develop depressive symptom , many patient meet full criterion major depression . Interferon-alpha-induced depressive symptom ameliorate pre-treatment antidepressant respond antidepressant emerge . Second , many study report , group , medically healthy patient depression exhibit elevated measure proinflammatory cytokine , include tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , interleukin ( IL ) -1 IL-6 . Moreover , positive relationship serum concentration proinflammatory cytokine severity depressive symptom recently report . Third , antidepressants show anti-inflammatory activity may work—at least part—by reduce inflammatory activity , give evidence clinical response associate reduction cytokine level . These data raise possibility cytokine antagonist , chimeric anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab , might antidepressant efficacy . Of special relevance proposal , patient treatment resistant show exhibit increased inflammatory activity ( reflect increase plasma concentration interleukin [ IL ] -6 soluble IL-6 receptor [ sIL-6R ] ) , suggest cytokine antagonist might especially effective patient . Providing care patient inflammatory bowel disease give u clear clinical impression infliximab rapidly improve mood energy level many patient prior demonstrable change bowel pathology . This impression line grow body evidence suggest TNF-alpha antagonist improve emotional functioning fatigue patient receive agent rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease . These finding patient inflammatory disease consistent notion TNF-alpha antagonist infliximab might provide acute symptomatic relief medically healthy patient treatment-resistant major depression symptom improvement might result decreased inflammatory activity . Moreover , medically healthy depressed patient increase inflammatory activity may likely benefit anti-TNF-alpha therapy .</detailed_description>
