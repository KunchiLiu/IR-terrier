	<detailed_description>This study use randomise control trial ass impact case-finding strategy vertebral fracture bisphosphonate drug prescribing primary care . A sample postmenopausal woman age 65-80 year Bristol invite take part . They individually randomise either intervention control arm 2:1 ratio favour control . The participant intervention arm attend GP practice receive simple 15 minute assessment , find high risk vertebral fracture thoracolumbar X-ray ; randomise control arm receive current standard method use identify woman high risk vertebral fracture ( active intervention ) . Follow-up three year . Baseline measurement take woman arm via self-completion postal questionnaire , include current prescription bisphosphonate osteoporosis medication . The woman intervention arm attend GP practice receive simple 15 minute assessment , find high risk vertebral fracture thoracolumbar X-ray arrange . They give leaflet lifestyle intervention aim improve bone health . Women control arm send leaflet . Post-intervention questionnaire send woman ask fracture current prescription bisphosphonate osteoporosis medication . The primary outcome proportion woman prescribe medication secondary fracture prevention intervention arm compare control arm . Secondary outcome include proportion fracture intervention versus control arm , compliance bisphosphonate drug prescribing . This study perform subject Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) approval , include provision Site Specific Assessment ( SSA ) , local Research Development approval . This study conduct accordance Research Governance Framework Health Social Care Good Clinical Practice .</detailed_description>
