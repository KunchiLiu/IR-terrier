	<brief_title>Efficacy Perindopril Prevent Recurrence Atrial Fibrillation Patients With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States approximately 1 billion individual worldwide . As population age , prevalence hypertension expect increase even unless broad effective preventive measure implement . Recent data Framingham Heart Study suggest individual normotensive 55 year age 90 % lifetime risk develop hypertension . The relationship blood pressure ( BP ) risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event continuous , consistent , independent risk factor . The high BP , great chance myocardial infarction , heart failure ( HF ) , stroke , kidney disease . Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) also major health problem describe one two emerge cardiovascular epidemic turn century . It frequent cardiac arrhythmia , affect 5 % individual age &gt; 65 year , associate increase risk stroke double all-cause mortality . The loss effective atrial contraction may result impaired cardiac performance , reduce exercise tolerance congestive heart failure . In addition , patient atrial fibrillation often disabling palpitation . Perindopril ( Coversyl ) angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor demonstrate efficacy control hypertension . There several line evidence suggest ACE inhibition may reduce incidence new-onset AF well AF recurrence .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must age 18 year old . Patients may either male female without childbearing potential ( adequate contraception ) . Patients must current diagnosis essential hypertension systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≤ 160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≤ 100 mmHg time inclusion visit AND Patients must least one episode symptomatic paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation within precede six month : With indication cardioversion case persistent AF With electrocardiogram ( ECG ) documentation AF With duration AF episode least 10 minute Unlikely cooperate study Pregnancy , breastfeeding , possibility become pregnant study ( patient must adequate contraception determine investigator ) . Alcoholism drug abuse Participation another study time within 30 day randomisation . Left ventricular systolic dysfunction ejection fraction 45 % le Myocardial infarction within past month prior selection visit Cardiac thoracic surgery within past 3 month likely perform trial Chronic AF ( continuously present &gt; 6 month ) AF secondary acute reversible condition ( e.g . postoperative atrial fibrillation , hyperthyroidism ) Currently require class I class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy ( atrial fibrillation arrhythmia ) Any medical condition make patient unsuitable candidate investigator 's opinion Any medical condition require ACE inhibitor angiotensinreceptor blocker therapy ( e.g . diabetes , know proteinuria 300 mg per day ) Renal insufficiency serum creatinine 180 μmol/L great Known bilateral renal artery stenosis Serum potassium 5.0 mmol/L great recent laboratory exam Positive pregnancy test ( beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ HCG ] perform woman childbearing potential ) Known intolerance ACE inhibitor Impossibility discontinue certain treatment selection visit Known contraindication ( ) perindopril Severe know liver disease include cirrhosis , biliary obstruction alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) elevation 3 time upper limit normal Use ACE inhibitor angiotensinreceptor blocker 3 month inclusion visit Severely uncontrolled hypertension SBP &gt; 160 mmHg DBP &gt; 100 mmHg inclusion visit .</criteria>
