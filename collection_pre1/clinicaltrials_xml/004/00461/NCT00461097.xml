	<brief_title>Oral Immunotherapy Childhood Egg Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , many 6 % 8 % child affect food allergy . In young child , allergic reaction egg range mild rash systemic anaphylaxis . The usual standard care allergy complete avoidance food allergen treatment accidental systemic reaction access self-injected epinephrine . However , accidental exposure allergen process food may difficult avoid . Currently , several therapeutic strategy investigate prevent treat food allergy . Since standard injection ( skin ) immunotherapy food allergy associate high rate allergic reaction , study recently try oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) food allergy . The purpose study determine safety efficacy administration OIT . The intent develop desensitization eventually tolerance egg allergen . This study evaluate tolerance egg white solid may gain gradually increase amount egg white solid give child long period time . This study last 48 month . The participant randomly assign receive oral immunotherapy treatment egg white solid placebo . This study include dose escalation maintenance follow oral food challenge ( OFC ) . For participant receive egg OIT , visit 1 consist multiple small incremental dos egg white solid . This follow 32-40 week gradual dose escalation stable maintenance dose egg white solid least 8 week . At approximately Week 44 , participant give OFC use 5 gram egg white solid identify desensitized individual . Participants study staff unblinded follow initial OFC . Maintenance egg OIT therapy continue additional 1-3 year . Oral Food Challenges 10 gram egg white solid perform participant maintenance egg OIT subsequent time point ( approximately Week 96 annually thereafter ) test desensitization . If pass , repeat OFC therapy 4-6 week perform test tolerance . An OFC test tolerance use 10 gram egg white solid follow open feeding egg . Participants receive placebo dose escalation maintenance give OFC use 5 gram egg white solid test desensitization approximately 44 week . They unblinded time , continue egg-restricted diet , follow 2 year . These participant receive OFC subsequent time point egg Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) decline less 2 kilounits antibody per liter ; OFC use 10 gram egg white solid follow open feeding egg . At select visit , blood urine collection , physical examination , prick skin test , atopic dermatitis asthma evaluation occur .</detailed_description>
