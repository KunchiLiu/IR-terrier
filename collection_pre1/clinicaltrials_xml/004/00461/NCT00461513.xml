	<brief_title>Patient-Centered Heart Failure Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) lead cause morbidity mortality VA. Disease management promising strategy improve care outcome , evidence support CHF disease management inconsistent open question remain . Prior study evaluate multi-modal intervention combine multidisciplinary collaborative care , telemonitoring , promotion patient self-care , explicit intervention comorbid depression , barrier optimal CHF care outcome . Moreover , effectiveness CHF disease management evaluate VA . Objective ( ) : We propose evaluate Patient-Centered Disease Management ( PCDM ) intervention include case finding , collaborative care management CHF comorbid depression , home telemonitoring . The primary aim ascertain whether PCDM intervention result well patient health status ( i.e . symptom burden , functional status , quality life ) usual care . Secondary aim include assessment whether intervention reduce hospitalization mortality , result guideline-concordant care , reduce depression increase patient medication adherence , self-efficacy satisfaction treatment . Methods : We propose 3-year , multi-site randomize study . VA patient CHF 4 VA Medical Centers ( Denver , Palo Alto , Richmond , Seattle ) affiliate clinic diminish CHF-specific health status ( Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score &lt; 50 ) eligible . We randomize enrolled patient 12-month PCDM intervention versus usual care ( target 300 patient arm ) . The PCDM intervention include collaborative care management CHF comorbid depression daily telemonitoring . Patient self-care promote telemonitoring intervention depression intervention . The primary analysis comparison change health status ( KCCQ score ) enrollment 12 month intervention versus usual care group . Secondary analysis include comparison rate hospitalization death , depressive symptom , proportion patient guideline concordant CHF care , medication adherence , 6-minute walk test , self-efficacy , patient satisfaction . In addition , cost-effectiveness analysis perform . All analyse intention treat . Impact : If successful , propose intervention improve quality care outcome veteran CHF cost effective . The intervention potential serve model disease management intervention VA , design 'effectiveness ' trial enhance implementation . This study joint effort CHF IHD QUERI group , Patient Care Services , Office Care Coordination . The study directly address several aim recently publish 'QUERI : A New Direction ' position statement , include : ) partnership QUERI group ; b ) explicit collaborative tie QUERI 'operational ' component VA ( i.e . Patient Care Services Office Care Coordination ) ; c ) focus beyond single disease entity ( i.e . CHF depression ) ; ) clinical study intervention might candidate national VA implementation . Moreover , study specifically engage patient care emphasize quality life outcome , central import VA health care mission .</detailed_description>
