	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 , open-label , multicenter study examine safety , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics , best overall response escalate dos proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 patient relapse relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . NPI-0052 novel , second generation proteasome inhibitor prevents breakdown protein involve signal transduction block growth survival cancer cell . The study divide 2 part : Part 1 Phase 1 explore 2 different schedule NPI-0052 determine maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend phase 2 dose ( Schedules A [ weekly dosing ] B [ twice-weekly dosing ] ) . Part 2 Phase 2 2-stage efficacy design select subgroup patient treat Schedule B recommend phase 2 dose , determine Part 1 . Amendment 13 protocol currently recruit evaluate safety preliminary evidence efficacy NPI-0052 multiple myeloma patient previously receive carfilzomib ( PR-171 , Kyprolis™ ) subsequently disease progression . Patients Part 2 follow survival 5 year date first dose .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part 1 Part 2 prior Amendment 13 : Age 18 year . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) score 70 % . All patient must histologic evidence multiple myeloma . Evidence relapse relapsed/refractory disease approve treatment available clinically indicate . In addition , patient may undergo prior bone marrow transplantation . For patient treat Recommended Phase 2 Dose patient require measurable relapsed relapsed/refractory disease . Disease must assess within 28 day prior treatment initiation . 1 . Measurable disease define one following : Serum Mprotein ≥0.5 g/dL Urine Mprotein ≥200 mg/24 hour Involved serum free light chain ( FLC ) level ≥10 mg/dL , provide serum FLC ratio abnormal 2 . Relapsed Refractory define : Must receive least 2 prior treatment regimen . Must receive prior treatment least 2 cycle lenalidomide least 2 cycle bortezomib ( either separate regimen within regimen ) . Must receive cytotoxic chemotherapy agent ( eg , alkylating agent ) . Relapsed Disease : Must progressive disease achieve least stable disease least one cycle treatment least one prior regimen . Refractory Disease : Must document evidence progressive disease within 60 day ( measure end last cycle ) complete recently receive antimyeloma drug regimen prior study entry All AEs result prior chemotherapy , surgery , radiotherapy must resolve NCICTCAE Grade 1 ( except hematologic parameter outline ) . The following laboratory result , within 7 day prior NPI0052 administration ( transfusion and/or growth factor support may use discretion Investigator Screening ) : Hemoglobin 8 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count 0.5 × 109/L Platelet count 30 × 109/L Serum bilirubin 1.5 × ULN AST 2.5 × ULN Serum creatinine 1.5 × ULN Creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min Signed informed consent . For patient Part 2 : Must previously receive least 2 cycle carfilzomib ( single agent combination agent ) subsequently disease progression within 60 day carfilzomib therapy . Carfilzomib recent therapy patient receive , patient must document disease progression within 60 day last antimyeloma therapy Inclusion Criteria Part 2 Amendment 13 : Age 18 year . Karnofsky Performance Status score 70 % . All patient must histologic evidence multiple myeloma evidence relapse relapsed/refractory disease define Patients require measurable relapsed relapsed/refractory disease . Disease must assess within 28 day prior treatment initiation . 1 . Measurable disease define one following : Serum Mprotein ≥0.5 g/dL Urine Mprotein ≥200 mg/24 hour Involved serum free light chain ( FLC ) level ≥10 mg/dL provide serum FLC ratio abnormal 2 . Relapsed Refractory define : Must receive least 2 prior treatment regimen . Must receive prior treatment least 2 cycle immunomodulator ( lenalidomide pomalidomide thalidomide ) . Must previously receive least 2 cycle carfilzomib ( single agent combination agent ) subsequently disease progression within 60 day carfilzomib therapy . Carfilzomib recent therapy patient receive , patient must document disease progression within 60 day last antimyeloma therapy . Patients may also receive bortezomib . In addition , patient may undergo prior cytotoxic chemotherapy , bone marrow transplantation previously participate clinical trial . Relapsed Disease : Must progressive disease achieve least stable disease least one cycle treatment least one prior regimen . Refractory Disease : Must document evidence progressive disease within 60 day ( measure end last cycle ) complete recently receive antimyeloma drug regimen prior study entry . All Adverse Events result prior chemotherapy , surgery , radiotherapy , must resolve CTCAE Grade 1 ( except hematologic parameter outline ) . The following laboratory result , within 7 day NPI0052 administration ( transfusion and/or growth factor support may use discretion Investigator screen period ) : Hemoglobin 8 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count 0.5 x 109/L Platelet count 30 x 109/L Serum bilirubin 1.5 x ULN AST 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min Signed informed consent . Part 1 Part 2 Administration chemotherapy , biological , immunotherapy , investigational agent ( therapeutic diagnostic ) within 14 day prior receipt study medication ( washout period reduce 7 day biologically targeted therapy ( eg , bortezomib , carfilzomib , thalidomide , lenalidomide , pomalidomide , dexamethasone equivalent ) , provide patient recover toxicity regimens per Inclusion Criterion # 4 ) . Patients must 6 week last dose nitrosourea 12 week BMT . Patients must 2 week last dose radiation . Patients Grade &gt; 1 proteinuria ( 1 g/24 hour exclude M protein = urine paraprotein subtract total urine protein ) , untreated urinary tract infection , well pre exist kidney disease ( acute chronic ) Investigator 's assessment would impose excessive risk patient . Patients evidence mucosal internal bleeding and/or platelet refractory ( ie , unable maintain platelet count 30 × 109/L ) . Significant cardiac disease define : Patients congenital long QT syndrome ; Congestive heart failure Class III IV NYHA classification ; History myocardial infarction ischemia within 12 month study enrollment . For patient Part 2 : abnormal leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ( &lt; low limit normal define study site patient age ) echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multiplegated angiography ( MUGA ) . Patients prior hypersensitivity reaction CTCAE Grade &gt; 3 therapy contain propylene glycol ethanol . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Female patient must postmenopausal surgically sterile , must agree use acceptable method birth control ( ie , hormonal contraceptive barrier method , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicidal condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study one month follow study completion . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day first NPI0052 administration . Male patient must surgically sterile agree use acceptable method contraception . Active uncontrolled bacterial fungal infection require systemic therapy ; infection require parenteral antibiotic . Known HIV positive positive active hepatitis A , B , C. Any medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , would impose excessive risk patient . Examples condition include infection require parenteral oral antiinfective treatment alter mental status psychiatric condition would interfere understand informed consent . Unwilling unable comply procedure require protocol .</criteria>
