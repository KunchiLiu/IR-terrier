	<brief_summary>Medical error affect patient safety generate huge concern since publication `` To Err Is Human '' 6 year ago [ 1 ] . Given complexity management intensive care unit ( ICU ) nature human activity , critically ill patient exposed adverse event ( AEs ) induce medical error . A large number study focus AEs medical error ICUs [ 2-6 ] , one main goal identify strategy prevent AEs thereby improve patient outcome . Choosing best AE serve indicator risk medical error challenge . In 2005 , group conduct systematic literature review present result 30 national expert clinical background internal , emergency , intensive care medicine . Using Delphi technique , expert select 14 AEs follow characteristic : high frequency , easy reproducible definition , association morbidity mortality , ease reporting without fear punishment ( Iatroref I study ) ( ref abstract ) . These AEs use French multicenter study ( 75 ICUs ) weeklong incidence evaluation ( Iatroref II study ) ( ref abstract ) . Preliminary evaluation result allow u choose follow AEs current Iatroref III study : error insulin administration , error anticoagulant administration , error anticoagulant prescription , unplanned extubation , unplanned removal central venous catheter . Evidence suggest guideline alone without reinforce strategy may insufficient change provider behavior effective intervention may multifaceted rather single-component strategy ( [ 7 ] ) . This study test composite intervention program . The objective study determine whether introduction composite intervention program decrease predefined AEs . Study hypothesis : The intervention program decrease incidence predefined AEs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design method Definition adverse event 1 . Error insulin administration Insulin give exactly prescribe ( include write protocol use ICU ) . The error may plan error implementation error regard nature insulin , dosage , preparation modality , administration modality . Insulin therapy require monitor capillary blood glucose level . 2 . Error anticoagulant prescription Non respect recommendation indication , dosage , administration modality , contraindication , drug-drug interaction , laboratory monitoring use VIDAL ( French Drug Compendium ) , learned society , ICU protocols , local drug committee . Either unfractionated heparin low-molecular-weight heparin may involve 3 . Error anticoagulant administration Anticoagulant give exactly prescribe . The error may plan error implementation error regard nature anticoagulant , dosage , preparation modality , administration modality , dose time , dose interval . Either unfractionated heparin low-molecular-weight heparin may involve . 4 . Unplanned catheter removal Unplanned complete removal central venous catheter patient staff care patient . 5 . Unplanned extubation Extubation plan physician . Unplanned extubations categorize self-extubation patient , accidental extubation technical reason ( porosity , section balloon , poorly secure tube ) , patient care ( bathing , take radiograph , transportation , care ) . Randomization procedure We use multicenter cluster randomize design ass effectiveness multifaceted intervention . Our statistician randomly assign unit compliance ICU guideline usual implementation multifaceted intervention prevent one AEs . Randomization occur ICU level . Units use intervention program serve control . The randomization procedure repeat every 2 1/2 month total four 21/2-month period 2007-2008 . During month January , study prepare site , clinical research assistant train use RheaTM data collection software ( http : //outcomerea.org/rhea/install ) . In Iatroref II study , anticoagulant prescription administration error occur 59/1377 ( 6 % ) patient , insulin administration error 20 % patient , unplanned catheter endotracheal tube removal 4 % patient . For study , collapse unplanned catheter removal unplanned extubation single group administration error prescription error anticiagulant another single group . Assuming 2400 patient admit four study ICUs study period , study would great 80 % power detect 4 % absolute decrease anticoagulant error , 3 % absolute decrease unplanned catheter endotracheal tube removal , 10 % absolute decrease insulin treatment error . We use two-sided score test comparison ( Farrington Manning ) . P level â‰¤0.05 consider statistically significant . Interventions In study ICU , physician train clinical research clinical research assistant prepare study two week precede randomization . The intervention AEs include three component : meeting ICU nurse physician , distribution educational material include pocket card show recommendation prevention AE , quality improvement session twice month . At site , physician train clinical research clinical research assistant lead feedback meeting ICU staff every 2 week 1 ) provide feedback AEs occur last 2 week , 2 ) review compliance recommendation pocket card , 3 ) analyze cause AEs suggest practice change appropriate . A report meeting draft . Intervention insulin administration error 1 . Meeting ICU staff discus epidemiology patient admit diabetes mellitus outside ICU , pathophysiology insulin resistance ICU patient , clinical study glycemic control mortality ward ICUs . 2 . Pocket card show control blood glucose give guideline control blood glucose level insulin infusion accord protocol study ICU . 3 . Feedback meeting twice month insulin administration error unit , preventability , appropriate change insulin treatment procedure . Intervention anticoagulant administration error 1 . Meeting ICU staff discus pathophysiology anticoagulant ( heparin HBPM ) , indication , AEs , specific problem ICU ( e.g. , use dialysis patient renal failure ) . 2 . Pocket card show nature anticoagulant , AEs , route administration ( IV enteral ) , specific problem ICU ( e.g. , use dialysis patient renal failure ) . 3 . Feedback meeting twice month anticoagulant administration error unit , cause noncompliance prescription , preventability . Intervention anticoagulant prescription error 1 . Meeting ICU staff discus pathophysiology anticoagulant ( heparin HBPM ) , indication , AEs , specific problem ICU ( e.g. , use dialysis patient renal failure ) . 2 . Pocket card nature anticoagulant , indication , dosage , route administration , Aes , recommend French Society Anesthesiology 2005 consensus conference . 3 . Feedback meeting twice month anticoagulant prescription error unit , cause noncompliance recommendation , preventability . Intervention unplanned extubation catheter removal 1 . Meeting ICU staff discus epidemiology , risk factor , mortality , prevention unplanned extubation catheter 2 . Pocket card show method secure catheter endotracheal tube , sedation protocol , wean protocol ICU . 3 . Feedback meeting twice month occurrence AEs unit , cause , preventability Study population All patient admit four study ICUs January , 2007 include . No patient exclude . The study submit appropriate ethic committee . Data collection Patients Data collect Outcomerea database . For patient , clinical research assistant complete case-report form computer use data capture software ( Rhea ) import record Outcomerea database . The following information record prospectively : demographic characteristic ( age , sex , body mass index ) ; underlie disease use Knaus classification [ 8 ] ; admission category ( medical , schedule surgery , unscheduled surgery ) , invasive procedure ( arterial venous central catheter , Swan-Ganz catheter , endotracheal intubation ) , nosocomial infection ( ventilator-associated pneumonia , nosocomial bacteremia , urinary tract infection , surgical site infection , sinusitis ) , decision withhold and/or withdraw life-sustaining treatment . The location patient prior ICU admission record , transfer ward define admission hospital another hospital ICU admission . Severity illness record admission day thereafter . Day 1 interval admission 8 A.M. next day ; day calendar day 8 A.M. 8 A.M . The Simplified Acute Physiology Score ( SAPS II ) [ 9 ] admission Logistic Organ Dysfunction ( LOD ) [ 10 ] score compute use bad physical laboratory data first 24 hour ICU . Duration stay ICU acute-care hospital vital status ICU hospital discharge record . Adverse event All AEs collect four period , regardless intervention implement . For AE , Rhea software use collect date time occurrence , clinical consequence ( predefined list ) , therapeutic consequence ( predefined list ) , preventability , severity , relation death five-item scale ( exclude , less unlikely , less unlikely , unlikely , likely , certainly ) . An open box available description AEs need . Statistical analysis A hierarchical ( patients/center ) logistic model use evaluate impact intervention . The intervention , well interaction period specific intervention , take account .</detailed_description>
