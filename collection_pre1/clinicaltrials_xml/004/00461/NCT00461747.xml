	<brief_summary>The primary objective compare safety efficacy three induction treatment : VBMCP-VBAD / Velcade versus Thalidomide / Dexamethasone versus Velcade / Thalidomide / Dexamethasone . The second one evaluate ability stem cell mobilization treatment order autologous transplant . Otherwise study want compare safety efficacy maintenance treatment : Interferón a-2b versus Thalidomide versus Thalidomide/Velcade .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GEM05 Patients With Multiple Myeloma Under 65 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 390 patient ≤ 65 year old diagnose Multiple Myeloma symptomatic disease receive previous chemotherapy MM include . Patients evaluate scheduled visit three study period : Pre-treatment , Treatment Follow . The Pre-treatment include Screening baseline visit . After provide informed consent , patient evaluate study eligibility Patients randomize ( 1:1:1 ) receive VBMCP-VBAD+Velcade ( Group A ) Thalidomide+Dexamethasone ( Group B ) Thalidomide+Dexamethasone+Velcade ( Group C ) . All receive induction treatment 24 week . After 4 week , without progression unacceptable toxicity , There stem cell mobilization autologous transplant . Three month transplant , patient randomize ( 1:1:1 ) receive maintenance treatment : Interferon-a ( Group M1 ) Thalidomide ( Group M2 ) Thalidomide+Velcade ( Group M3 ) three year . Once treatment period finish follow carry . During period evaluate response , progression-free survival global survival every three month .</detailed_description>
