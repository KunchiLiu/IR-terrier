	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The effect GH IGF-I heart demonstrate numerous experimental study . GH IGF-I receptor express cardiac myocytes , IGF-I cause hypertrophy culture rat cardiomyocytes delay cardiomyocyte apoptosis . In addition , GH IGF-I direct effect myocardial contractility , increase intracellular calcium content enhance calcium sensitivity myofilaments cardiomyocytes . Clinical study patient disorder GH/IGF-1 axis confirm significant relationship GH/IGF-I cardiovascular system . Interestingly , GH excess deficiency state associate abnormal cardiac function attendant increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Our contention apparent paradox relationship may due change energy state myocardium GH excess ( acromegaly ) deficiency ( GHD hypopituitarism ) inability cellular metabolism change appropriately compete demand oxidative stress anabolic process . Data giant GH-overexpressing transgenic mouse demonstrate reduce creatinine phosphate-to-ATP ratio support effect GH cardiac energy status . AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) energy sensor cell show important regulator cell metabolism , include cardiac cell ( Dyck &amp; Lopaschuk , 2002 ) . AMPK activate rise AMP/ATP ratio , program intracellular metabolism conserve energy oxidate metabolism suspend anabolic process . A substantial body evidence testifies importance AMPK associate regulation myocardial energy status cardiac function . - Reduced activity AMPK feature inherit cardiomyopathy . - Low energy status measure non-invasively predictor death dilate cardiomyopathy . - Activation AMPK reduce injury experimental model ischaemia - Reduced cardiac energy reserve feature type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , cardiovascular death account 80 % mortality T2DM . - Drugs know activate AMPK improve mortality type 2 diabetes , metformin glitazones ( Kahn et al. , 2005 ) . - Cannabinoids ghrelin , first identify group increase cardiac AMPK level , show improve ischaemia-reperfusion injury ( Frascarelli et al. , 2003 ; Underdown et al. , 2005 ; Shibata et al. , 2005 ) . Taking experimental observation together , infer diabetic cardiac muscle , impaired activation AMPK despite low energy level , potentially failure normal mechanism favour oxidative metabolism cytoprotective function ischaemia . In patient , cardiac AMPK directly study , although relate animal study assess effect GH excess deficiency activation AMPK cardiac intracellular energy status myocardium function . However , use 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) , vivo measurement high energy phosphate molecule assess non-invasively show disease important clinical consequence . Specifically , phosphocreatine ( PCr ) , ATP determine ADP level derive phosphocreatine : ATP ratio ( Scheurmann-Freestone 2003 ) . This approach recently use demonstrate low ambient level myocardial ADP patient T2DM . In current study investigate energy status patient acromegaly GHD normalisation GH status . We hypothesise untreated acromegaly , unrestrained drive anabolism associate low energy status , particularly inability respond exercise . We propose GHD , reduce anabolism associate relatively high level energy impairment muscle mass . We anticipate normalisation hormone level result either medical surgical therapy result improvement energy-storing phosphate molecule ratio myocardium . Acromegaly - Cardiac function Acromegalic cardiomyopathy specific myocardial disease acromegaly ( Clayton , 2003 ; Sacca et al. , 2003 ; Colao et al. , 2004b ) . Active acromegaly associate 2- 3-fold increase mortality , mainly cardiovascular disease , although effective treatment excess mortality reverse ( Sheppard , 2005 ) . In early stage , acromegalic cardiomyopathy characterise increase left ventricular mass , eccentric remodel normal diastolic function high cardiac output state reduction systemic vascular resistance ( Fazio et al. , 2000 ) . In next stage , increase heart mass diastolic dysfunction , attribute direct injury myocardium GH hypersecretion , occur absence associate disease like hypertension , diabetes mellitus , thyroid dysfunction . These abnormality progress dilate cardiomyopathy heart failure acromegaly remain untreated many year . There specific structural change myocardium increase myocyte size interstitial fibrosis ventricle . Left ventricular hypertrophy common ( 64 % newly diagnose case ) even young patient short duration disease ( Colao et al. , 2003 ) . Functionally , main consequence change impair leave ventricular diastolic function , particularly exercise , exercise tolerance reduce ( Colao et al. , 2002 ) . Myocardial perfusion impair patient active acromegaly assess single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , thus represent early stage cardiac involvement acromegaly may directly mediate GH excess ( Herrmann et al. , 2003 ) . Some structural functional change reverse effective treatment low serum GH level less 1-2 ng/ml ( glucose suppress random , respectively ) normalize IGF-I long-term outcome survival improve ( Colao et al. , 2002 ; Jaffrain-Rea et al. , 2003 ) . Diastolic function improve treatment , effect exercise tolerance variable , longitudinal data require assess benefit . Acromegaly - Coronary atherosclerosis Although coronary disease prevalence 3-40 % acromegalic patient , considerable controversy whether directly relate GH excess . According well-controlled study ( Otsuki et al. , 2001 ) intima thickness measure , extent atherosclerosis acromegalic patient higher non-acromegalic subject , consider increased number atherosclerotic risk factor , lipid abnormality , diabetes , increase homocystein , lipoprotein , fibrinogen platelet activator inhibitor 1 level strong predictor coronary vascular disease , GH might therefore even protective ( Matta &amp; Caron , 2003 ) . In recently describe study 79 acromegalic patient 22 age-matched control difference observe intima thickness ( Paisley et al. , 2006 ) . Increased concentration IGF-I - via vasodilatotary effect mediate nitric oxide - might involve lack susceptibility atherosclerosis acromegalic patient . There previously publish study use electron beam coronary CT group patient . Acromegaly - Skeletal muscle It recognise skeletal muscle acromegaly fatigue rapidly adequately explain , particularly relation increase muscle mass . It suggest may result associate metabolic derangement ( diabetes thyroid abnormality ) , direct effect GH excess muscle . Increase muscle specific creatinine kinase level detect patient active disease improve reduction serum GH ( McNab &amp; Khandwala , 2005 ) . Microscopic examination skeletal muscle acromegalic patient show type 1 fibre hypertrophy ( Nagulesparen et al. , 1976 ) . GHD - Cardiac function Patients GH deficiency increase mortality due cardiovascular disease . Most study show decrease heart function reduce leave ventricular mass cardiac output , reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction particularly exercise ; addition increase incidence coronary artery disease ( Colao et al. , 2004a ; Colao et al. , 2004b ; Svensson et al. , 2005 ) . The mechanism cardiac abnormality GHD debate , data support hypothesis GHD lead reduced cardiac mass , reduce contractility , reduce pre-load increase after-load , could lead reduce stroke-volume reduced cardiac output ( Colao et al. , 2004b ) . Treatment GH result improvement cardiac function reduction peripheral resistance due direct anabolic action myocardium increase dimension could also secondary increase cardiac output stroke volume result increase contractility increase pre-load . In conclusion , GHD associate cardiac dysfunction relate degree duration GHD GH replacement seem enhance ventricular mass cardiac function reverse diastolic abnormality ( Juul , 1996 ) . GHD - Coronary sclerosis The evidence link coronary sclerosis GHD robust although unclear whether direct effect GH deficiency cardiac endothelium , indirect effect increase cardiovascular risk factor document patient hypopituitarism GH deficiency . These include increase abdominal adiposity , abnormal LDL triglyceride level , high fibrinogen plasminogen activator inhibitor activity , increase marker inflammation ( interleukin-6 C-reactive protein ) consequently increase intima-thickness ( Colao et al. , 2004a ; Colao et al. , 2004b ) . In study , use electron-beam CT ( EBCT ) non-invasive mean determine coronary artery disease , sensitive indicator IHD . This allow u control change onset and/or recovery ischaemia might due macrovascular ischemia rather reduce intracellular capacitance . There previously publish study use electron beam coronary CT group patient . GHD - Skeletal muscle Adult growth hormone deficiency ( AGHD ) associate fatigue , tiredness isometric muscle strength reduce 76 % . After 6 month GH therapy , muscle mass increase 5 % ( Bengtsson et al. , 1993 ; Juul , 1996 ) . Neuromuscular dysfunction also observe ( abnormal electromyogram interference pattern analysis ) improve initiate GH therapy ( Webb et al. , 2003 ) . The reduced exercise capacity observe GHD multifactorial reduce skeletal muscle mass important contribution ( Juul , 1996 ) . In summary , exist evidence demonstrate patient GH deficiency GH excess abnormal cardiac skeletal muscle function , although nature cardiac abnormality differs . In acromegaly hypertrophy impaired contractility dysfunction amplify exercise . In GHD , risk factor IHD cause premature occlusive coronary artery disease , couple poor anabolic stimulus reduce muscle mass . Skeletal muscle echo process . . In transgenic mouse overexpressing GH ( acromegalic mouse ) phosphocreatine -to-ATP ratio measure MRS significantly low GH overexpressing mouse control , suggest impaired energy level myocardium ( Bollano et al. , 2000 ) . We hypothesise chronic growth hormone excess may lead reduce energy level within myocardium , restoration normal GH level ameliorate abnormality . Our model would also predict GHD rest energy level would normal even high , primary defect reduction muscle mass due reduce anabolic stimulus . In patient GH excess GHD ass cardiac energy level MRS , non-invasive technique assess myocardial energy metabolism treatment , technique successfully use establish abnormal heart energy level patient diabetes heart failure ( Scheuermann-Freestone et al. , 2003 ) . Objectives 1 . Determine cardiac ( rest ) skeletal muscle ( rest , peak exercise recovery ) energy metabolism patient GH excess detect change normalisation GH IGF-1 level 2 . Determine cardiac skeletal muscle energy metabolism patient GH deficiency detect change normalisation IGF-1 level 3 . To correlate muscle energy metabolism parameter GH IGF-1 status control subject patient group 4 . Determine prevalence coronary artery calcification patient GH excess GH deficiency correlate risk factor surrogate marker CHD ( serum level high sensitivity CRP , lipoprotein ( ) , homocysteine , insulin resistance ( HOMA analysis ) . 5 . Determine anatomical distribution atheromatous plaque within coronary artery extent isolate plaque compare diffuse disease . Methods Cardiac skeletal investigation - MRI 1.5T ( Siemens Sonata ) use measure right leave ventricular morphology global function ( Sandstede et al. , 2005 ) ( i.e . leave right ventricular systolic end-diastolic volume ejection fraction ) . Tissue phase mapping use measure radial rotational tissue velocity regional wall motion abnormality abnormal contractile pattern . - 31P MRS use previously describe ( Crilley et al. , 2000 ; Roest et al. , 2001 ) monitor intracellular PCr ATP heart muscle . Acquisition trigger use electrocardiographic gating . Cardiac diastolic function measure use cine MRI volume-time curve tissue phase mapping parameter . - Heart failure severity ( NYHA status ) determine degree dyspnoea ( 6 min walk test ) . - Peak O2 uptake ( MVO2 ) estimate metabolic gas exchange analysis perform maximal treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing . - Skeletal muscle MR image spectroscopy : The protocol 31P MRS determination calf muscle ( gastrocnemius soleus ) metabolism rest dynamic exercise well establish ( Scheuermann-Freestone et al. , 2003 ) . A T1-weighted MR image use determine muscle cross-sectional area 31P MRS gastrocnemius muscle perform rest , exercise . Each subject lie 3T superconducting magnet calf overlie 6 cm diameter surface coil . The muscle exercise plantar flexion right ankle , lift weight 10 % lean body mass distance 7 cm rate 30/min . After acquisition four spectrum ( 1.25 min ) , weight incrementally increase 2 % lean body mass every minute . The subject exercise stop fatigue muscle study recovery . On retesting therapy , exercise continue subject stop fatigue ( treatment may lengthen time ) . Relative concentration Pi , PCr ATP measure signal intensity spectra describe previously ( Adamopoulos et al. , 1999 ; Butterworth et al. , 2000 ; Scheuermann-Freestone et al. , 2003 ) . - Electron beam coronary CT ( EBCT ) ass coronary disease . As calcium deposit early stage atheroma formation , EBCT detect sub-clinical coronary disease many year result ischaemia . The extent coronary artery calcification reflect overall impact risk factor , know unknown , end organ , arterial wall , give superior predictive value Framingham risk assessment ( Thompson &amp; Partridge , 2004 ; Pletcher et al. , 2004 ) . EBCT scan perform use GE-IMATRON 300 scanner use conventional protocol . Calcium deposition within coronary artery assess total volume Agatson correction . The number plaques calcium score measure leave main artery , leave anterior descending , leave circumflex , right coronary artery , addition overall score .

Apoprotein A/B , High sensitivity C-reactive protein , Lipoprotein ( ) , Homocysteine , Insulin ( HOMA analysis ) , biochemistry liver function , pregnancy test . Endocrine investigation include Glucose tolerance test ( acromegaly patient ; GHD necessary ) , GH day-curve ( mean 5 estimation throughout day ) , serum IGF-I , pituitary peripheral hormone ( LH , FSH , cortisol , TFT , testo/E2 , PRL ) , estimation duration disease ( presumed duration acromegaly estimate comparison patient ' photograph take 1-3-decade span interview date onset acral enlargement clinical symptom ( Damjanovic et al. , 2002 ; Colao et al. , 2003 ) ) Patient selection : Patients recruit St. Bartholomew 's Hospital ( Dr P.
