	<brief_summary>The purpose study see treatment Biaxin ( clarithromycin ) antibiotic give mouth 3 month delay growth lymphoma shrink lymphoma . We would also like see Biaxin ( clarithromycin ) work lymphoma blood cells.There evidence medication may change behavior lymphocyte , addition know anti-infection activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biaxin Based Antibiotic Therapy Previously Untreated , Advanced Stage Indolent Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate biaxin ( clarithromycin ) -based antibiotic therapy previously untreated patient indolent lymphoma require active lymphoma therapy ( utilize GELF criterion , ) . This primary objective Response rate ( CR + PR ) stratify Follicular/Non-Follicular disease . The secondary objective study understand biologic correlate indolent lymphoma biaxin ( clarithromycin ) response progression : Response rate ( CR + PR ) accord H. pylorus positive negative ( RR confidence interval estimate subset ) . Immunohistochemistry diagnostic biopsy specimen : Lymphocyte- Activated Macrophage ( CD68 ) select marker clarify tumor infiltrate cell . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) study evaluate possible HDAC ( histone deacetylase ) inhibition biaxin ( clarithromycin ) therapy .</detailed_description>
