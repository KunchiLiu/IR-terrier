	<detailed_description>Vasopressin appear key mediate factor menstrual pain . This position stem finding hormone , arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , cause constriction uterine blood vessel turn produce congestion uterus result dysmenorrhea . Prior menses , blood vessel uterine wall become engorge blood . Elevated concentration vasopressin act V1a receptor cause constriction uterine vascular smooth muscle , contribute discomfort pain primary dysmenorrhea . Consequently , blockade receptor selective V1a receptor antagonist would expect provide therapeutic benefit woman primary dysmenorrhea . SRX251 new chemical entity potent V1a receptor antagonist property , acceptable safety profile demonstrate preclinical study . This study intend evaluate safety pharmacokinetic profile single oral dose SRX251 healthy human female volunteer preparation study safety pharmacological activity amelioration pain associate primary dysmenorrhea .</detailed_description>
