	<brief_summary>The research aim identify new predisposition gene endocrine tumour . Our focus initially pituitary adenoma include growth hormone-secreting tumor ( somatotrophinomas ) prolactin secrete tumour ( prolactinomas ) , wish extend work pituitary tumour cases/families . The recruitment process follow . 1 . We recruit patient Endocrine outpatient clinic inpatient ward . In addition ask colleague Endocrinology Departments ( specialty Clinical Genetics , Pathology , General Medicine ) identify potentially suitable patient endocrine &amp; pituitary tumour record . We shall focus patient good evidence inheritance condition : relatively early onset ; multiple lesion ; affect family member . Conditions predispose gene identify ( principally MEN ) exclude study . Patients directly contact u also enter study . 2 . The Consultant look patient contact patient initially inform him/her study . 3 . We contact patient ( generally telephone ) discus study would entail term information sample . 4 . Subject agreement ( 3 ) , patient receive 'Information Sheet patient pituitary tumour ' 'Consent Form ' blood sample Consultant 's clinic . 5 . We contact additional family member ( appropriate ) initial approach family member already recruit study . The additional family member may develop tumours similar proband , may unaffected individual provide useful information gene identification purpose ( example , spouse may greatly aid power gene mapping linkage . They receive `` Information Sheet family member '' . analysis ) . 8 . Archival tissue obtain HTA license tissue bank . This establish bank whose licence primarily diagnosis use research . 9 . We undertake laboratory work , genetic linkage analysis , candidate gene mutation screen study loss heterozygosity tumour , identify gene predispose condition , AIP gene . In addition would like screen gene relate chaperon AIP molecule , AhR , gene currently identify ( PDE4A5 , survivin Tom20 protein ) may identify . Blood sample DNA RNA cod unique ID number . Pituitary endocrine tumour sample collect surgery keep liquid nitrogen −80 C. They cod unique ID number . Candidate gene sequence perform Barts London Medical School Genome Centre . RNA expression study blood adenoma tissue sample perform RT−PCR . Protein expression study perform Western blotting immunohistochemistry . The first gene wish study cause familial acromegaly , disease result pituitary adenoma secrete growth hormone . To establish candidate gene also cause possibly sporadic ( familial ) case disease , sample ( blood tissue ) collect patient sporadic disease analyse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We wish find gene predispose pituitary tumour , find gene work assess gene ( similar gene ) condition related pituitary tumour . We study recently identify new familial pituitary adenoma gene AIP ( AhR interact protein ) partner molecule example AhR ( aryl hydrocarbon receptor ) familial sporadic pituitary adenoma case . We 3 main question : Is identify gene ( e.g . AIP ) involve pathogenesis familial pituitary tumour ( acromegaly ) , mutation gene family ? What function new gene pituitary tumorigenesis ? Does new gene partner role sporadic pituitary adenoma tumorigenesis ? Pituitary tumour comprise around 15 % intracranial neoplasm , present distinct clinical characteristic , usually term local space-occupying effect , secondary tumoral hypersecretion consequence . Acromegaly gigantism due 99 % case somatotroph adenoma , demonstrate monoclonal great majority instances1 . It suggest 6 major feature oncogenesis need present case cancer2 , 3 ( activation oncogene , inactivation tumour suppressor gene [ TSG ] , inhibition apoptosis ) appear relevant pituitary tumorigenesis ; tumour usually benign adenoma , formation new blood vessel capacity metastasis uncommon , although way evade senescence may important . It therefore suggest small number mutation oncogenes and/or TSG 's may causally responsible pituitary adenoma . This make excellent model early stage tumorigenesis . However , much establish regard molecular pathology tumour , include extensive study laboratory3-7 , initiate mutation mutation responsible tumorigenesis date defy analysis . Early work establish 30 % patient acromegaly one 2 mutation alpha-subunit receptor-associated G protein , lead constitutive activation , difficult show relevant biological consequence . We identify partial failure feedback regulation somatotroph tumour , mutation relevant gene recorded6,8 . We others also explore possibility somatic mutation sporadic somatotroph tumour gene identify hereditary syndrome associate acromegaly ( MEN-I , Carney syndrome ) , appear extremely rare9 . However , work collaboration Chicago group seek identify gene responsible familial acromegaly , rare dominant condition10-14 . Some 46 family describe worldwide last 40 year , cohort 8 family region chromosome 11q13 identify : seek use data microarray studies15 pinpoint abnormal gene patient , far unsuccessfully . Our recent work suggest abnormality cell cycle pituitary adenoma , especially down-regulation cycling-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 activation cycle E , secondary putative abnormal growth factor receptor ( ) , specific mutation receptor absent16 . Very recently , Finnish group identify dominant gene low penetrance appear segregate familial somatotroph prolactin-secreting tumours17 . This lie near position 11q13 , remain unclear whether indeed gene identified family much strongly penetrant condition . The gene code AIP ( = aryl hydrocarbon receptor interact protein , also know XAP2 hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 ARA9 = AhR ( aryl hydrocarbon receptor ) -activated protein 9 . AIP 330 amino acid PPIase-like domain FKBP12 four tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPRs ) , probably important protein-protein interaction . AIP putative activating partner aryl hydrocarbon receptor , probably increase function AhR . AhR link induction hepatic detoxify gene product response environmental toxin dioxin18 . However , additional function appear regulation cell cycle , suppress cyclin E increase expression p2719 . The AhR also show interact cyclic AMP . In latter instance , interaction cAMP appear compete dioxin-dependent pathway , AhR enhance transport nucleus transcriptional effect quite separate stimulate dioxin related ligand . As cAMP important second messenger somatotroph tumour , may relevant pathway underlying apparent activity AIP tumour suppressor . There therefore primary reason believe AIP may indeed function TSG pituitary adenoma , loss heterozygosity 11q13 see tumour familial cases17 . However , initial Finnish data base 3 family , plan investigate entire cohort family acromegaly prolactinomas , well family process collect . We contact many endocrinologist throughout UK , identify small number additional family . Finally , initial study patient apparently isolated case acromegaly , present unusually young age , especially gigantism . In case mutation AIP gene record . Plan Investigation : We plan screen known family history acromegaly and/or prolactinomas , well pituitary tumour family identify UK , mutation AIP gene . In addition would like screen gene relate chaperon AIP molecule , AhR , gene currently identify ( PDE4A5 , survivin Tom20 protein ) may identify . As data suggest early onset , aggressive , seemingly sporadic case acromegaly prolactinoma could also cause germline mutation , include patient clinically sporadic early-onset aggressive disease . The patient recruit Endocrinology Departments collaborate centre ( Barts Hospital London , Newcastle , Oxford , Stroke-on-Trent , Sheffield , Manchester , Aberdeen Stroke-on-Trent ) . Blood sample assess germline DNA , RNA protein isolate peripheral lymphocyte collect peripheral blood sample . Affected family member identify , well first-degree relative affect unaffected . At time , apparent mutation polymorphisms AIP track cohort 100 germline blood sample normal volunteer assessment background gene frequency order ass relationship disease status . Patient tumour sample collect RNA protein expression study .</detailed_description>
