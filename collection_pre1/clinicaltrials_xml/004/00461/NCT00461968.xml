	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare percent change LDL cholesterol induce ezetimibe simvastatin monotherapy co-administration agent Black , White Hispanic men . Ezetimibe drug block sterol absorption simvastatin block hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis . The hypothesis test Blacks likely responsive LDL lower ezetimibe statin Blacks low production cholesterol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Efficacy Safety Ezetimibe Statin Monotherapy Co-Administration Both</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins effectively low plasma LDL cholesterol level low recommend dos , subsequent double dosage result modest additional reduction ~6 % . A large inter-individual variability magnitude LDL-lowering response see patient take statin , reveal data provide P.I . Merck &amp; Co. Inc . Mean reduction plasma level LDL-C variation response ( SD ) provide ~300 subject take simvastatin , ezetimibe ezetimibe simvastatin . The mechanisms responsible inter-individual variability lipid-lowering response know . The effect ethnicity statin-associated LDL-lowering examine one study . In study , direct attempt make implement NCEP guideline secondary prevention use statin . Fewer Blacks Whites reach goal treatment plasma LDL-C level , despite see frequently clinic lipoprotein measure often . It propose difference due low compliance drug regimen among Blacks . An alternative explanation ethnic difference response therapy effectiveness statins differs ethnic group . We hypothesize Blacks likely responsive agent inhibit cholesterol absorption less responsive agent interfere cholesterol synthesis . This hypothesis also base result recent study conduct laboratory show low level lathosterol Blacks Whites . Lathosterol precursor cholesterol therefore marker de novo synthesis sterol . In contrast , campesterol plant sterol plasma level assume indicator sterol absorption . To directly address study question , intervention study compare relative efficacy ezetimibe simvastatin carry . In aim answer follow question : - Do Blacks , Whites Hispanics respond differently simvastatin ezetimibe ? - Do baseline level noncholesterol sterols and/or campesterol : lathosterol ratio predict responsiveness cholesterol-lowering drug ? - Does low level plasma lathosterol Blacks reflect reduce rate cholesterol synthesis secondary increase cholesterol absorption , relative responsiveness two different class LDL-lowering agent use clinical trial related balance cholesterol absorption synthesis individual ? The ultimate goal identify genetic metabolic index use individualize cholesterol lower therapy , allow effective therapeutic regimen select . This particularly important long-term lipid lower therapy use individual whose short-term cardiovascular risk low since would particularly desirable use effective drug low dos set . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 4-period , crossover study 26 week duration comprise 3-day screening period ; 2-week , single-blind placebo run-in period ; four 6-week , double-blind treatment period . Each individual randomize one four treatment sequence . Randomization stratify race ( Black/White ) ; Black White subject allocate 1:1:1:1 ratio 4 treatment sequence . The Allocation schedule generate Merck Merck maintain blinding . There 10 require clinic visit ( visit 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14 ) , 5 telephone contact ( visit 3,6,9,12 ) mid-point treatment period review compliance diet , study medication , alcohol consumption requirement . A post-study follow-up also conduct via telephone serious adverse experience review ( visit 15 ) . Total visit 15 ( 10 clinic 5 telephone ) Each treatment period last 6 week . During screen visit , subject undergo physical exam , dietary assessment , vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiration ) , provide blood ( 3 tablespoon ) sample routine chemistry ( metabolic comprehensive panel ) , complete blood count , liver function test , thyroid test , plasma cholesterol , triglyceride lipoprotein cholesterol measurement beta-estimation ) level , urine sample . Subjects meet eligibility criterion schedule return Visit 2 begin two-week single-blind placebo run-in phase . At Visit 3 , subject , pill count , miss two tablet single-blind study medication randomize one 4 treatment sequence . Subjects take 2 pill day . Vital sign perform visit . A physical complete end study . Serum chemistry measurement , plasma cholesterol triglyceride level , lipoprotein cholesterol beta-quantitation , measurement apolipoprotein B measurement non-cholesterol sterol measure visit ( 3-4 tablespoon blood drawn ) . The analysis repeat separate plasma sample data inconsistent need verification . Circulating level noncholesterol sterol measure gas chromatography mass-spectrometry , routine procedure laboratory , sample . Investigators blind lipid/lipoprotein value Visit 1 . Hematology urinalysis perform Visits 1 14 . Dietary counseling provide study . Also , DNA extract blood sample obtain trial examine gene control cholesterol metabolism .</detailed_description>
