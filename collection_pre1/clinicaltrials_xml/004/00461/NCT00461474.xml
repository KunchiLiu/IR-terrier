	<brief_summary>The purpose study conduct research see help people spinal cord injury shoulder pain decrease pain shoulder . We investigate effectiveness home exercise program shoulder change task perform compare educational program shoulder pain . There new experimental procedure include study ; instead comparison two type treatment provide problem . The new part study collect information treatment . We hypothesize participate home exercise program decrease shoulder pain increase activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Strengthening Exercises Improving Movement Painful Shoulders Adults With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adults sustain spinal cord injury ( SCI ) potential lead active , productive life near normal life expectancy . Recent study demonstrate many people SCI develop health functional problem earlier age non-disabled peer , symptom often occur mid-30 's mid-50 's . These symptom impairment include : pain , musculoskeletal problem , decline energy , loss strength new functional limitation . These example challenge people may face reach mid-life SCI . A prevalent impairment long-term SCI population upper extremity pain . Both incidence severity pain increase long duration SCI . The impact shoulder pain function independence SCI significant detrimental . Development shoulder pain SCI population associate increase weight-bearing demand place upper extremity mobility , muscle imbalance shoulder girdle , poor postural alignment trunk paralysis need function seat position . The efficacy specific intervention fully investigate . Treatment effectiveness must determine use measure include pain impairment ( severity ) , disability functional limitation associate pain , participation handicap limitation associate pain . The goal develop program standardize resistance , require little equipment , simple conduct minimizes time commitment require patient . The effect combine intervention shoulder pain function assess randomized clinical trial compare intervention attention control group receive generalize information regard shoulder joint anatomy pain management . Secondary goal study identify critical muscle group strength change associate shoulder pain reduction determine impact intervention physical activity , health relate quality life overall subjective quality life .</detailed_description>
