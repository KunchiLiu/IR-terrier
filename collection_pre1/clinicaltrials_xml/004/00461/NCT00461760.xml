	<brief_summary>This randomise controlled trial HPV test cytology triage HPV positive woman compare liquid-based cervical cytology ( LBC ) . Although LBC widely use cervical cancer screen Canada present , Pan-Canadian Cervical Cancer Forum recommend use likely standard care time data publish , trial design account . Further , LBC improve cost-effectiveness HPV test LBC medium suitable HPV test well cytology thereby allow triage test undertaken sample without recall woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There overwhelm body data show HPV test potential improve effectiveness cervical cancer screen program thereby reduce rate cervical cancer . As result , grow ethical dilemma potentially mean prevent disease death among Canadian woman , yet study undertake offer standard evidence require change large-scale public health program cervical cancer screen . In recognition , Pan-Canadian Cervical Cancer Forum ( PCCCF ) call evaluation HPV test within context Canadian organise cervical cancer screen program . Given potential health benefit could achieve , pan-Canadian expert group issue consensus statement call evaluation HPV test primary screening , imperative properly design power study conduct definitively establish whether provide hypothesise health benefit within Canada . The result trial demonstrate whether use HPV test single primary screen test within organised Canadian cervical cancer screen program able 1 ) provide reduction cervical cancer incidence , 2 ) allow screen interval extend 3 ) improve cost-effectiveness cervical cancer screening . If trial demonstrate HPV test provide benefit , BCCA implement HPV test single primary screen test within provincial cervical cancer screen program trial directly influence provision service BC . In addition , many Canadian province territory either implement plan implement screen program similar one BC time trial complete , many program operate . Therefore , result trial directly applicable program constitute demonstration project rest Canada . A list woman due cervical screening send study collaborate Family Physicians ( FPs ) month study centre provincial screening program . An invitation letter send FP potentially eligible woman due cervical cancer screening . If woman interested participating , contact study centre information . Study staff discus detail trial , confirm eligibility administer short survey . Women consent trial visit FP screen test sample obtain send BC Central Laboratory Service ( BC-CLS ) randomize one study arm : Note : Recruitment safety arm complete December 31 , 2010 point forward , woman randomize 1:1 control intervention arm . A total ~25,000 woman ( ~9140 Control Intervention arm respectively , ~6,000 Safety arm ) enrol FOCAL trial . Control arm : Sample test LBC . - Those negative result recall next screen 2 year negative , exit screen 4 year . Those positive cytology result reflex HPV testing , referral colposcopy base result . - Exit screen test HPV cytology test 2-year safety-check arm : Sample test HPV . - HPV negative recall 2-years exit screen cytology - Women HPV positive residual LBC specimen process cytology manage accord protocol HPV-positive woman 4-year intervention arm . 4-year intervention arm : Sample test HPV . - HPV negative recall 4 year exit screen HPV cytology test - Women HPV positive undergo reflex cytology test cytology negative recall 12 month HPV test cytology . At 12 mo , participant refer colposcopy &gt; =ASC-US HPV positive . If HPV cytology negative 12 month return routine screening pool arm recall exit screen 4-years . - Women HPV positive &gt; = ASC-US refer colposcopy manage accord colposcopy result .</detailed_description>
