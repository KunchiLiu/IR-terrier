	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , include emphysema chronic bronchitis , fourth common cause death second lead cause disability United States . COPD estimate responsible 13.4 million physician visit 13 % hospitalization nationally . These hospitalization usually cause acute exacerbation characterize increase symptom include dyspnea shortness breath ( SOB ) , cough , wheeze , sputum production . The significant disability people COPD primarily due symptom dyspnea ( shortness breath ) affect individual 's quality life physiological impairment . Despite optimal medical pharmacological therapy , people COPD continue suffer chronic progressive dyspnea symptom cough fatigue . We previously show individualized face-to-face dyspnea self-management program effective improve dyspnea activity daily live ( ADL ) , physical functioning , self-efficacy manage dyspnea . Using experimental longitudinal design , i-DSMP compare Face-to-Face Dyspnea Self-Management Program ( f-DSMP ) Attention Control ( AC ) intervention</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present time , education symptom management patient treatment , include exercise , primarily provide within structured episodic pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) program . These PR program short duration , available small percentage people expensive cover third party payer , often require travel patient disabled . Given estimate 10 24 million U.S. adult COPD , would benefit PR , less 0.1 % accommodate give time . In US maintenance exercise program follow PR reimburse , therefore , available patient . A number self-management program test multiple chronic disease , less study self-management program patient COPD . The self-management program COPD include education limited skill train significantly improve symptom . Home-based PR self-management program nurse home visit study provide less costly accessible alternative . Clearly grow need accessible alternative avenue provide ongoing support therapy COPD patient . The Internet provide new excite delivery channel offer patient disability opportunity great involvement health care decision-making unparalleled opportunity learn , inform , communicate one another health care provider support patient ' self-management effort . Several Internet-based study chronic illness increase self-efficacy symptom management , perception available support , patient ' involvement health care decision making , reduce symptom health care cost . The publish study evaluate use internet support self-management COPD patient pilot study proposal . Our study demonstrate improvement self-efficacy dyspnea daily activity measure . This study expand finding pilot study .</detailed_description>
