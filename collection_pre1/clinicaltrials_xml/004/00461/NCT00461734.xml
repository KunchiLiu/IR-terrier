	<brief_summary>This study do patient require implantation cardiac pacemaker ( electronic device control heartbeat ) complete heart block ( heart rhythm abnormality result slow heart beat ) . Pacemakers regulate heart beat deliver pulse electricity special wire ( pace lead ) place inside heart . This study compare two group pacemaker patient . Each group pace lead place particular location heart . The purpose study show whether position use one group well maintain effective heart function compare position use group . The lead one group place position call Right Ventricular Apex . This traditional frequently use position pacemaker lead . The lead group place position call Right Ventricular High Septum . This less commonly use position , may result health benefit patient compare Right Ventricular Apex .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There increase amount evidence suggest position heart may effective conventional Right Ventricular Apex ( RVA ) position restore good heart function . The best site place lead yet prove . This study compare long term clinical effect two different lead position . The measurement take assess clinical effect include : - effectiveness heart 's pump action ( measure ultrasound scan ) - measurement far patient walk 6 minute - analysis blood sample - collection information pacemaker heart rhythm problem Half patient study receive conventional lead place common RVA position heart . The half receive relatively new type lead place call Right Ventricular High Septal ( RVHS ) position . In order fairly compare outcomes two different lead position study design 'randomized ' , 'blind ' trial . This mean group patient enter chosen random patient tell group . Patients equal ( 50:50 ) chance either group . By carefully compare clinical difference two group patient , study aim prove whether additional benefit patient RVHS lead position use . All lead use study show safe patient available commercially implantation . All implanting doctor involve study experience implant pacemaker lead use study .</detailed_description>
