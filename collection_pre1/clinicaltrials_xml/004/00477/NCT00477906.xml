	<brief_summary>Previous study suggest M-Vax , melanoma vaccine prepared patient cancer cell , stimulate patient ' immune system react cancer . AVAX identify dose schedule administration M-Vax work optimally . In study , AVAX determine whether M-Vax effective shrinkage melanoma spread ( stage IV ) . To increase effectiveness , M-Vax administration follow administration low dose interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) , market drug know stimulate immunity cause shrinkage melanoma . Two-thirds patient receive M-Vax + IL2 , one-third receive placebo vaccine + IL2 . The study blind neither patient physician know material receiving . To eligible study , patient must least one melanoma tumor surgically remove make vaccine . In addition , must melanoma spread lung soft tissue site ( skin , surface skin , lymph node ) . Eligible patient may previously receive one treatment ( example , chemotherapy ) melanoma . Side effect M-Vax expect mild ; common development sore pimple site vaccine injection . The low dose IL2 may cause fatigue mild symptom . It expect 387 patient treat study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>M-Vax + Low Dose Interleukin-2 Versus Placebo Vaccine Metastatic Melanoma Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>M-Vax therapeutic melanoma vaccine consist autologous melanoma cell irradiate modified hapten , dinitrophenyl ( DNP ) . There large amount publish evidence hapten modification make visible immune system antigen , include tumor antigen , otherwise elicit immune response . This Phase III , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multi-centered trial M-Vax patient stage IV melanoma measurable metastasis lung and/or soft tissue . To eligible screening , patient undergo surgery therapeutic intervention , yield adequate amount melanoma tumor cell preparation vaccine , pas vaccine release test . Eligible patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study . Patients assign double-blind fashion M-Vax Placebo Vaccine 2:1 ratio ( M-Vax : Placebo Vaccine ) . The dose M-Vax 4.0-20.0x10 ( 6 ) DNP-modified autologous melanoma tumor cell . The Placebo Vaccine consist diluent . An initial dose M Vax Placebo Vaccine administer without BCG follow low dose cyclophosphamide ( 300 mg/m2 iv ) . Then M Vax Placebo Vaccine mixed Bacillus Calmette Gu√©rin ( BCG ) administer weekly 6 week . Four course interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) administer patient start 2 week last vaccine ; course consist 3 million units/m2 subcutaneously daily 5 day follow 16-day rest period . The primary endpoint study : 1 ) Best overall anti-tumor response , 2 ) Survival , measure % survive two year . Patients evaluate anti-tumor response modify RECIST criterion week 24 25 ( i.e. , 5-6 week completion IL2 ) . At 6-month point patient remain study receive additional single booster dose M-Vax Placebo Vaccine mixed BCG . This follow four course IL2 . Two additional evaluation anti-tumor response take place 38-39 week ( month 9 ) one-year point . Then patient regularly evaluate tumor status adverse event evidence tumor progression require new therapy . Patients remain on-study followed death maximum 5 year . The intended sample size 387 , 25 site participate United States , Europe , Israel . An interim analysis perform half patient accrue .</detailed_description>
