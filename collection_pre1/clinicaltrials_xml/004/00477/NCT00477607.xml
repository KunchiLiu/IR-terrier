	<brief_title>Alpha-Lipoic Acid Preventing Hearing Loss Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment With Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Determine ability alpha-lipoic acid supplementation prevent reduce incidence severity hear loss cancer patient undergo treatment cisplatin . Secondary Determine drug improve oxidative state , measure malondialdehyde measurement oxidative stress , thereby protect patient ototoxic-induced hearing loss . OUTLINE : This placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify cancer stage institution . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral alpha-lipoic acid supplement day begin 1 week start cisplatin treatment continue 1 month completion cisplatin . During cisplatin treatment , patient discontinue supplement 1 day prior cisplatin treatment resume daily supplement 2 day post treatment . Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo supplement day begin 1 week start cisplatin continue 1 month completion cisplatin . During cisplatin treatment , patient discontinue supplement 1 day prior cisplatin treatment resume daily supplement 2 day post treatment . Hearing ototoxicity assess baseline , day chemotherapy , 1 3 month post chemotherapy . Blood sample collect periodically measure malondialdehyde alpha-lipoic acid level . After completion treatment cisplatin , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
