	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety new experimental drug , IL-7 , people HIV infection . Animal study show IL-7 improve function number infection-fighting cell call T lymphocyte , T cell . If study show IL-7 safe , additional study do see improve function number T-cells HIV-infected person . HIV-infected person receive HAART therapy least 12 month enrol study stable treatment least 3 month enrollment may eligible study . Participants 10 clinic visit 3 month . They receive three injection IL-7 , one injection week 3 consecutive week . The injection give shot skin arm leg . On day injection , participant stay clinic 8 hour long observation collection blood sample . Three additional visit ( one every 3 month ) may schedule . During study visit follow may do : - Medical history , physical examination , blood test every visit . - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) study day 0 ( day first dose ) , 1 , 7 ( day second dose ) , 14 ( day third dose ) 21 . - Chest x-ray study day 21 . - Blood sample collection frequent interval first 96 hour first dose administration . A catheter ( thin plastic tube ) may put vein arm leave place allow several blood sample draw without repeat needle stick . - Urine test several time study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study IL-7 HIV-infected Patients ( Inspire )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interleukin 7 ( IL-7 ) essential cytokine thymic development post-thymic survival , expansion maturation T lymphocytes human . The rationale use IL-7 immunotherapy HIV infection would support expansion , survival functional property T lymphocytes enhance immune reconstitution . Phase I study previous formulation rhIL7 cancer HIV infect patient show T cell proliferation expansion achieve dos well tolerate . The newly glycosylated form IL-7 test study longer half-life allow weekly administration . This phase I/IIa , open label , single arm trial test safety three subcutaneous injection IL-7 three different dose level ( 10 , 20 30 micrograms/kilograms ) test sequentially . Eligible subject ( 400 cells/microliters great CD4 great 101 cells/microliters VL less 1000 copies/milliliter , antiretroviral therapy least one year ) give 3 dos IL-7 weekly interval ( day 0 , day 7 day 14 ) . Participants follow day 0 , 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 additional visit day 35 , 56 , 77 optional follow every 3 month thereafter week 56 ( approximately 1 year enrollment ) . The three dos test sequentially ( 10 , 20 30 micrograms/kilograms per dose ) dose escalation occur safety data day 28 previous dose level participant complete . Ten subject enroll dose level dose escalation occur subject complete four week without evidence dose-limiting toxicity . Secondary end point include PK study glycosylated rhIL7 well immunologic study throughout duration study assess evidence IL7 biologic activity marker T cell proliferation expression alpha chain IL7 receptor . This multi-center international study sponsor Cytheris site USA , Canada , Italy France . Children exclude separate study require future safety biologic activity agent establish adult . The study enroll total approximately 30 participant .</detailed_description>
