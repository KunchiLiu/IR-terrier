	<brief_title>Inflammatory Breast Cancer ( IBC ) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IBC : IBC rare rapidly grow form breast cancer . Currently , know risk factor biological feature ( gene ) researcher use help design well treatment IBC . Study Participation : If diagnose IBC doctor believe may IBC , ask participate IBC registry study . This registry study collect data , blood tissue future study . - For patient never receive treatment IBC breast condition doctor believe may IBC : You core , breast tissue , skin biopsy . If lymph node notice core biopsy , lymph node core biopsy final needle aspiration do well . To perform core , breast tissue , skin biopsy , affect area skin numb anesthetic , small amount skin tissue remove small knife . This fresh sample collect diagnosis study . - You additional blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn study , routine blood draw . The additional blood drawn IBC . - For patient receive treatment IBC : Your original biopsy sample and/or breast surgery tissue sample collect diagnosis ( need doctor ) study . - You interview . During interview , ask question medical history well general background information . The interview conduct study chair designee examination room meeting physician private setting . The interview take 30 minute complete . Language Assistance call participant non-English speaking . You interview n't IBC . - Your clinical data collect medical record , include information blood tumor tissue sample information magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) scan may . - Photos breast take needed . Length Study : Your participation study complete sample data collect . Research Tissue Bank : Before blood tissue sample information use research , people research must get specific approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . All research do MD Anderson , include research involve sample information IBC tissue bank , must first approve IRB . If doctor believe breast condition may IBC , test show tissue breast cancer IBC , tissue sample collect store IBC tissue bank use non-cancer non-IBC control sample ( healthy tissue use comparison ) future study relate IBC . This investigational study . Up 1200 patient take part study . Up 1000 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
