	<brief_title>Effect Treating Sleep Apnea Cognition Patients With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) experience nighttime sleep fragmentation often become hypoxic night . The fragmentation hypoxemia frequently result daytime impairment include impairment cognitive functioning . The state-of-the-art treatment SDB Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) . Many SDB patient successfully treat CPAP show improvement memory cognitive function . Data show strong relationship SDB dementia patient Alzheimer ’ Disease ( AD ) high rate SDB . This proposal examine whether treat SDB CPAP patient AD result improvement cognitive functioning . The specific aim assess whether patient mild AD SDB tolerate CPAP compliant treatment ; examine effect CPAP treatment SDB patient mild AD SDB ; examine effect CPAP treatment cognitive functioning patient mild AD SDB ; examine whether improvement great six week CPAP treatment three week treatment . Since caregiver often disturb patient poor sleep , also evaluate effect patient ’ treatment caregiver . Specifically , secondary aim evaluate whether caregiver feel CPAP improve patient ’ sleep evaluate whether caregiver feel sleep improves patient ’ sleep improves . Patient identify mild AD SDB extensive neuropsychological battery . Half randomize CPAP treatment half shamCPAP . After three week neuropsychological test repeat . The shamCPAP switch CPAP CPAP group remain CPAP additional three week . Neuropsychological test repeat . The long-term goal line research find new approach might improve quality life , delay dementing process , postpone institutionalization save million dollar nurse care cost .</detailed_description>
