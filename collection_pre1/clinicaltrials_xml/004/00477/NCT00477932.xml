	<detailed_description>Pentalogy Cantrell rare disorder patient combination severe defect middle chest include sternum ( breastbone ) , diaphragm ( muscle separate chest abdomen ) , heart , abdominal wall . The defect affect male female apparent birth shortly . This study collect blood , urine , tissue sample 50 patient study-wide Pentalogy Cantrell inherit disease involve mutation non-muscle gene . Mutations non-muscle gene show result human defect involve blood platelet , kidney , hear sight . The major objective protocol study variety blood , tissue urine sample look protein , DNA , RNA collect sample . Enrollment study entirely voluntary subject elect withdraw study time . Each subject receive oral write explanation study purpose , procedure , risk study language comprehensible . The Investigator available answer question subject may regard study . If subject minor , parent sign consent minor must legally recognize parent guardian . Where deemed appropriate , child also include discussion trial minor 's assent obtain . The parent guardian sign designate line inform consent attest fact child give assent . If minor child refuse provide assent , participation study occur . Informed consent obtain Investigator designee , copy sign consent document give subject place subject 's medical record . Subjects may withdraw permission use blood/tissue/urine specimen time . Tissue and/or blood and/or urine sample participate institution identify case Pentalogy Cantrell and/or relate syndrome collect . These sample send National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) analysis keep period 5 year , unless subject withdraws permission period . Standard method use collect blood , tissue , and/or urine sample . For example , blood sample obtain routine blood draw tissue may obtain previously obtain tissue secondary surgery . Samples send NHLBI analysis identifier , new information discover , research subject may contact . All sample store locked storage facility maximize patient confidentiality . Anticipated Adverse Events list protocol consent . Unanticipated Adverse Events report appropriate institution . All serious adverse event report Investigator verbally write Clinical Director NHLBI IRB within time frame set protocol . The nature study warrant DSMB , therefore principal Investigator , Dr. Robert Adelstein provide oversight safety data analysis conduct study . The benefit study discovery disease mutation cause disease , therefore yield generalizable knowledge regard disorder .</detailed_description>
