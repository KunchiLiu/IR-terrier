	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy lapatinib take together capecitabine Japanese patient . The study proceed two phase ; first phase ( Part1 ) lead evaluation mainly tolerability well PK parameter . If major safety concern Part 1 , study move second phase ( Part 2 ) evaluate safety clinical activity .</brief_summary>

Subjects must refractory breast cancer define progression locally advance metastatic setting relapse within 6 month complete adjuvant therapy . Prior therapy must include , limited : Taxane contain regimen least 4 cycle 2 cycle provide disease progression occur taxane . Anthracycline contain regimen least 4 cycle 2 cycle provide disease progression occur anthracycline . Subjects relapse &gt; 6 month completion adjuvant anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy , anthracycline indicate , consider meet anthracycline prior exposure requirement . Taxanes anthracyclines may administer concurrently separately . Prior treatment capecitabine permit . Prior treatment must contain trastuzumab alone combination chemotherapy least 6 week standard dos adjuvant advanced/metastatic setting . Subjects hormone receptor positive tumor must disease progression follow hormonal therapy unless intolerant hormonal therapy hormonal therapy consider clinically appropriate . Subjects stable CNS metastasis ( asymptomatic , systemic steroid anticonvulsant least 3 month ) eligible . Measurable disease accord modify RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) ( see Section 6.2 , Efficacy p.49 ) . Subjects must archive tumor tissue available biomarker assessment .
