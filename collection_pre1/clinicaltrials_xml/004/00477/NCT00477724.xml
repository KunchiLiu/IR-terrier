	<brief_summary>Severe CTEPH lead impaired physical capacity restrict quality life poor prognosis . Pulmonary endarterectomy represent best choice therapy , thrombus locate central pulmonary vessel therefore operate . By operation pulmonary artery pressure normalise patient ' survival improve . Up , successful endarterectomy patient receive anticoagulation . Despite operation many patient remain symptomatic restricted physical capacity . Therefore hypothesis project patient , even successful operation , show peripheral vascular remodelling ventilation-perfusion mismatch elevate pulmonary pressure exercise . In study aim analyse many patient CTEPH endarterectomy show elevate pulmonary artery pressure rest exercise limited physical capacity , hemodynamics , oxygen uptake quality life need therapy . Another aim examine whether exercise respiratory therapy may improve patient postoperatively . Therefore 30 patient CTEPH &gt; six month endarterectomy , ongoing restrict exercise capacity shall include . After baseline examination University hospital Heidelberg patient receive exercise respiratory therapy three week . The patient receive examination end rehabilitation 3 week 15 week . All examination include medical history , family history , physical examination , ECG echocardiography rest exercise , cardiopulmonary exercise testing , assessment respiratory muscle strength , SF-36 questionnaire quality life , laboratory test MRI . Rehabilitation conduct clinic rehabilitation Koenigstuhl , Heidelberg . Participants randomise two group , control group receive conventional therapy three week , physical exertion avoid training group additional exercise respiratory therapy .</brief_summary>
