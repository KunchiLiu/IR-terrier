	<detailed_description>1.0 STUDY PLAN 1.1 . Study Objectives The objective clinical study evaluate hemodynamic performance Mosaic Ultra™ stented porcine bioprosthesis aortic position . 1.2 . Study Design This prospective non randomize multi center clinical study design obtain hemodynamic data Mosaic Ultra™ stented porcine bioprosthesis . All participate center follow common clinical investigation plan . 1.3 . Sample Size Study Duration The basis study least 60 MosaicÒ Ultra™ stented porcine bioprosthesis implant follow six month . 2.0 PATIENT SELECTION 2.1 . Patient Eligibility Criteria The patient population include patient require aortic valve replacement heart valve disease ( acquire congenital ) candidate bioprosthetic valve . Patients informed aspect study ask give Informed Consent . The patient population must geographically stable able attend one follow-up examination implant center . Patients willing unable fully participate follow-up enter study . 2.2 . Inclusion Criteria - Patients require aortic valve replacement without coronary artery bypass graft surgical treatment Atrial Fibrillation . - Patients able provide inform consent . 3.3 . Exclusion Criteria - Concomitant procedure coronary artery bypass graft surgical treatment Atrial Fibrillation . - Patients indicate receive mechanical prosthesis . - Patients replacement exist valve prosthesis . - Patients refuse able provide inform consent . - Patients require emergency surgery . 4.0 STUDY METHODS 4.1 . Data Requirements For patient enrol study , information collect pre-operatively , operatively , 6 month post-operatively . Patients enter study preoperatively evaluate clinical information . Upon implant Mosaic bioprostheses appropriate surgical data obtain . Follow-up data require discharge six month post-operative . Endpoint patient study six month follow-up . The required variable specify CRF . Samples CRF 's provide Appendix C. Transthoracic echocardiography require pre-op six month . All center provide unique center ID . Enrolled patient identify CRF 's use center ID sequential three digit number . 4.2 . Case Report Form ( CRF ) Completion All appropriate section case report form must fill completely accurately black blue ink . Before submission Medtronic investigator ( designate co-investigator ) must review , sign date CRFs . The original sent Medtronic , copy remain center patient study file . All effort make submit CRFs Medtronic within 6 week examination . 4.3 . Study File A study file set maintain study center . This repository record relate study . All case report form traceable source document . Source document must maintain patient medical record . 5.0 DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING 5.1 . Data ownership All data collect study regard confidential entered common database property Medtronic . 5.2 . Data analysis Appropriate statistical analysis perform compare hemodynamic performance various size . Hemodynamic data summarize valve size . Descriptive statistic employed report patient population characteristic , operative post-operative data . 5.3 . Data report Medtronic complete submit participate investigator complete report use collect data . 5.4 . Publication policy It intent Medtronic study center investigator publish result study . Medtronic may elect use data outcome study promotion product . Investigator provide copy abstract , presentation , and/or manuscript Medtronic least thirty ( 30 ) day prior submission .
