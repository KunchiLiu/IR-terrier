	<brief_title>Phase II GM-CSF Plus Mitoxantrone Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effect combination mitoxantrone GM-CSF time progression patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer . To date , curative treatment prostate cancer become hormone-refractory . Treatments appropriate prostate cancer stage include docetaxel , , combination prednisone , recently show lead survival benefit , mitoxantrone , , date , show lead favorable outcome steroid alone , without survival benefit . GM-CSF cytokine think lead enhance antitumor immune response , presumably induction tumor necrosis factor interleukin-1 expression , well growth proliferation macrophages dendritic cell . Both preclinical model Phase II study suggest GM-CSF single agent may antitumor activity advanced prostate cancer . To date , use GM-CSF treatment prostate cancer explore different context , , specifically , single agent androgen-independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) , combination thalidomide hormone-naïve prostate cancer androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer ketoconazole AIPC , finally CTLA4 HRPC . For patient HRPC fail first line chemotherapy , , non-curative option available , one involve use mitoxantrone . On basis GM-CSF 's mechanism action , addition GM-CSF mitoxantrone-containing regimen may lead enhanced antitumor activity patient HRPC .</detailed_description>
