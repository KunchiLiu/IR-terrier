	<brief_title>The Therapeutic Effect Bromocriptin Patients With Primary Aldosteronism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aldosteronism ( PA ) , common curable disease hypertension , characterized inappropriate production aldosterone , least partially autonomous renin-angiotensin system . A recent clinical study report patient PA experience high sate higher rate cardiovascular event essential hypertension ( Corry Tuck 2003 ; Milliez , Girerd et al . 2005 ) . The prevalence metabolic syndrome high primary aldosteronism essential hypertension also report ( Fallo , Veglio et al . 2006 ) . The wide applying plasma aldosterone/plasma rennin activity ( ARR ) screen test among hypertensive patient report much high prevalence disease , 12 % hypertensive patient . In past decade , increase diagnosis rate PA observe National Taiwan University Hospital , average 15-20 newly diagnosis case every year . Idiopathic bilateral adrenal hyperplasia ( BAH ) aldosterone-producing adenoma ( APA ) lead cause primary aldosteronism . Unilateral adrenalectomy reasonable therapeutic option APA aldosterone antagonists usually bring well blood pressure ( BP ) control BAH . Not every APA patient would accept operation medical condition , cure rate hypertension APA adrenalectomy 50-70 % study . For patient BAH , aldosterone antagonist first choice treatment , however , intolerance high dose medication uncommon . To best knowledge , alternative treatment patient . Dopaminergic regulation aldosterone secretion well demonstrate normal subject well patient PA. We show D2 receptor down-regulate transcription aldosterone synthase ( CYP11B2 ) via specific PKC isoform probably intracellular calcium level . Furthermore , reciprocal change mRNA D2 receptor CYP11B2 APA . D2 receptor also demonstrate neuroendocrine tumor , eg. , pheochromocytoma , prolactinoma , GH-secreting adenoma ect . [ Camacho &amp; Mazzone 1999 ] Administration D2 agonist , bromocriptin ( BMC ) , standard treatment prolactinoma , either pre-operative reduction tumor non-surgical patient [ Chattopadhyay et al. , 2005 ] . Reduction shrinkage prolactinoma observe patient treated BMC [ Biswas et al. , 2005 ] . Anti-proliferative effect apoptosis BMC demonstrate several cell line [ Wasko et al. , 2004 ] . Recently , also demonstrate BMC , addition decrease aldosterone secretion expression CYP11B2 , could inhibit cell proliferation H295 cell , adrenocortical carcinoma cell line , down-regulation ERK . In context , propose BMC may alternative treatment PA , APA BAH .</detailed_description>
