	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety effectiveness medication call CellCept treat refractory ( responded treatment ) interstitial cystitis . CellCept belong class medication call immuno-suppressants . Immuno-suppressants work body reduce immune system 's ability produce certain reaction cause inflammation . In people , inflammation produce immune system damage healthy tissue cause symptom pain discomfort . CellCept approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient organ transplant . When use combination drug , CellCept help prevent rejection transplant organ use widely patient receive kidney , liver heart transplant . CellCept also frequently used FDA approve treatment severe rheumatoid arthritis disease cause body 's immune system act healthy tissue joint . Due special activity , CellCept may useful treat certain inflammatory disease condition like interstitial cystitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Multicenter Double-Blind CT Evaluate Efficacy Safety Mycophenolate Mofetil . . .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial Cystitis ( IC ) bladder syndrome characterize painful , debilitate chronic , universally successful treatment option currently available . Characteristic symptom include pain bladder filling , mark urinary frequency ( relieve pain ) . The FDA-approved oral medication treatment IC pentosan polysulfate ( Elmiron ) , recently demonstrate collaborative research network perform little efficacy placebo ( ref ) , expensive associate side effect . Current clinical treatment protocol empiric usually aim relieve pain . There press need effective oral medication treatment IC . The presentation symptoms quite variable among patient , suggest IC multi-factorial syndrome several propose etiology , may interrelate .</detailed_description>
