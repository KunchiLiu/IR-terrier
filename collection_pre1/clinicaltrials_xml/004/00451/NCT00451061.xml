	<brief_title>The Efficacy Alpha-blockers Expulsion Distal Ureteral Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy alpha-blocker expulsion distal ureteral stone Urolithiasis estimate among 8 % -15 % population Europe North America.1-5 Patient suffer renal colic represent common reason visit emergency room hospitalization . The stone usually locate ureter , mostly low third . Some distal ureteral stone would pass spontaneously , depend factor stone 's size , location , shape , smooth muscle spasm , submucosal edema anatomy . Since renal colic one painful condition , time expulsion stone reduce much possible . In case stone obstruct does'nt pas , damage kidney might occur , surgical intervention consider . However , surgery anesthesia risk free . The local reaction obstruct ureterolithiasis manifest ureteric smooth muscle contraction , edema , inflammation pain . The ureter contain α -adrenergic receptor smooth muscle layer , along 's entire length . Since receptor play important role ureteric contraction renal colic , several study perform order evaluate effect α receptor blockade . These study demonstrate different α blocker increase frequency stone expulsion rate among patient renal colic , reduce time expulsion reduce analgesic consumption . Most study evaluate efficacy Tamsulosin , selective α 1A α 1D adrenoreceptors antagonist . The low intramural portion ureter , pass detrusor muscle contains mostly α 1D α 1A adrenergic receptor . A common treatment day obstructive uropathy due benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) Alfuzosin . Despite fact α adrenergic receptor blocker selective α 1 adrenergic receptor subtypes , drug proven efficacy consider uroselective high specificity sensitivity , treatment BPH . There significant difference efficacy two α blocker ( Alfuzosin vs. Tamsulosin ) concern symptoms relief flow improvement , side effect similar . Only one study day describe use Alfuzosin expulsion distal ureteric stone . The objective study compare patient would receive standard treatment distal ureterolithiasis ( analgesic , Rowatinex ) patient would receive also non selective α blocker ( Alfuzosin ) selective α blocker ( Tamsulosin ) . This order evaluate efficacy treatment α blocker expulsion distal ureterolithiasis . Materials method : Participants - Individuals refer emergency room admit urology department Soroka hospital , ( Beer-Sheva , Israel ) acute renal colic . The patient would consider study stone would locate distal ureter . This study estimate include 120 patient last 6 month . The patient would divide randomly three group : A . Patients renal colic would receive Abitren Rowatinex B . Same therapy plus Tamsulosin ( 0.4 mg/daily ) C. Same therapy A plus Alfuzosin ( 10 mg/daily ) The treatment would last 4 week . The duration trial would expulsion stone , longer 4 week . Patients would pass stone spontaneously , would refer intervention ( ESWL , ureteric stent insertion , ureteroscopy ) Treatment discontinuation would due hospitalization ( intractable pain , fever , need intervention ) The α blocker treatment would daily , stone expulsion , four week . The initial treatment protocol would standard treatment - I.V fluid analgesic Each patient would initially evaluate : - physical examination - abdominal radiography - serum creatinine leukocytes measurement - urinalysis - renal ultrasonography - blood pressure measurement The follow : The blood pressure measurement would take family physician , two day one week begin treatment . Four week treatment begin , patient would check patient clinic . Unenhanced CT scan , serum creatinine blood pressure measurement would take . In case patient would pass stone , intervention would schedule .</detailed_description>
