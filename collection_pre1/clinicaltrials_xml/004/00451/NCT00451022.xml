	<brief_summary>This study aim provide long-term follow-up care patient previously enrol vaccine study involve poxviral vector . Vectors sequence genetic material use introduce specific gene genetic makeup . The study involve use drug biologic agent . Participants undergo annual health history . Because certain virus enter cell create protein viral gene , type vaccine treatment use refer gene therapy . The gene express poxviral vector become part genetic material leave behind . Because gene therapy somewhat new technology , prolong monitoring patient ' health status necessary , accord new specific reporting requirement harmful event patient undergo gene therapy study . The risk long-term negative effect gene therapy patient receive quite small . Still , important update least annually . This annual monitoring health status extend 15 year , accord guideline Food Drug Administration , long patient willing participate . Patients receive poxviral vector ( vaccinia fowlpox , ) National Cancer Institute , trial affiliate Laboratory Tumor Immunology Biology , may eligible study . Participants involve follow form data collection : - Annual medical history physical examination first 5 year follow last vaccine . - Annual telephone contact last 10 year . - Health status check , include primary cancer status , secondary malignancy , neurologic disorder , autoimmune disorder , hematologic disorder . - Blood test presence HIV antibody . - Reporting medical problem , include information unexpected hospitalization medication . If participant die , study document cause death autopsy information available .</brief_summary>
