	<brief_title>Acute Renal Failure Surgical Intense Care Units - NTUH-SICU-ARF ( NSARF ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative acute renal failure serious complication result prolonged stay high mortality . Acute renal failure ( ARF ) develop 5 30 % patient undergo surgery , cause , associated mortality rate 60â€“90 % . Despite advance supportive care innovation renal replacement therapy past three decade , mortality rate patient remain high . In previous analysis NSARF ( National Taiwan University Hospital-Surgical Intense Care Unit- acute renal failure database ) , mortality rate acute renal failure patient SICU 66.4 % , dialysis dependent rate ARF 5 % renal recovery rate 28.6 % . Therefore , issue concerned increase survival rate renal recovery rate acute renal failure . Perioperative ischemic reperfusion injury may result acute renal failure ( ARF ) , patient invariably recover . However , remain large number patient whose kidney fail recover ARF , therefore long-term dialysis require . The dys-regulation inflammatory response critically ill patient implicate important mechanism underlie development multiple organ system dysfunction , septic shock , death . Furthermore , increase oxidative stress consider important pathogenic mechanism development ischemic toxic renal tubular injury . We hypothesize extensive immune dys-regulation increase oxidative stress might important factor lead ARF , and/or associate all-cause mortality critically ill patient . In study , find ( 1 ) first year , relationship cytokine storm free radical storm urine output post-surgical ARF , effect renal replacement therapy serum cytokine free radical level ( 2 ) 2nd year , difference outcome low low-efficient daily dialysis ( SLEDD ) , low low-efficient daily dialysis-hemofiltration ( SLEDD-f ) , pharmacokinetics SLEDD ( 3 ) 3rd year , sill establish disease severity score post-operative ARF patient . ( NSARF score ) focus long-term outcome survivor postoperative ARF . From diagnosis prognosis , incorporate important marker disease diagnosis , treatment long term outcome . Finally , hope improve mortality life quality postoperative ARF .</detailed_description>
