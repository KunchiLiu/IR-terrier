	<brief_summary>The trial compare postoperative complain , pain , quality life implantation heavy-weight alternative light-weight mesh , randomly allocate patient inguinal hernia disease two group surgeon , group train operate one mention mesh . Hypothesis : There less postoperative pain implantation light-weight mesh .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Significance Mesh Thickness Operation Inguinal Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The implantation mesh operation inguinal hernia result continuously diminishing frequency reoperations . Randomized controlled trial indicate hernia repair open mesh technique shorter learn curve , cheap may give less recurrence laparoscopic hernia repair general surgical practice . Furthermore , local anesthesia significant advantage patient health related economy compare general anesthesia regional anesthesia . The experience last decade within field groin hernia surgery focus interest quality life postoperative pain ( especially chronic pain ) . Chronic pain define pain remain 3 month operation . Recent study indicate one third patient operate inguinal hernia degree chronic pain 4-6 % patient pain interfering daily activity one year surgery . In present study heavy-weight polypropylene mesh compare light-weight partly absorbable mesh . In expertise-based randomized control trial patient randomly allocate two group surgeon , group well train use one two mesh .</detailed_description>
