	<brief_summary>The rate labor induction rise throughout United States variety reason . Medical condition lead increase risk prolong pregnancy mother fetus infrequent . In addition , elective delivery become common . Foley balloon catheter placement common method use labor induction woman unfavorable cervical assessment . There several study use various volume Foley balloon catheter labor induction range 30ml 80ml , however , study replicate finding large study compare 2 different volume balloon . The investigator plan compare instillation 30ml sterile saline versus 60ml Foley balloon catheter woman undergo induction labor unfavorable cervix . The investigator observe follow outcome : rate delivery within 24 hour , cervical dilation foley balloon catheter expulsion , insertion balloon expulsion interval , induction delivery time interval , peak oxytocin requirement , presence infection meconium , cesarean delivery rate , operative vaginal delivery rate , indication operative vaginal cesarean delivery , cervical laceration rate , placental abruption rate , 5-minute Apgar score , umbilical cord arterial blood pH base excess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Labor With Foley Balloon Catheter : Inflation With 30ml Compared 60ml</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All potential candidate approach study undergo write consent willing participate . Each candidate randomize 30ml 60 ml Foley balloon catheter volume . A random number generator use within seal envelope place assignment . Nulliparous multiparous patient randomize separately . The patient position standard cervical exam - either digital speculum exam , depend individual patient preference provider choice . For digital exam , sterile Foley balloon catheter digitally place endocervical canal , extraamniotic space ( fetal head , external unruptured amniotic sac , internal o cervix ) . For speculum exam , cervix wipe three time Betadine cleanse solution , sterile Foley balloon catheter bulb place direct visualization endocervical canal , extraamniotic space . Once balloon place provider insert 30ml sterile saline . The provider leave room . The patient 's nurse open envelope patient allocate 60ml volume group , nurse add additional 30ml sterile saline . If patient 30ml group , RN staff simulate placement additional saline foley balloon without actually place additional saline order also blind patient assign group . The MD/CNM provider return room , blind inflation Foley balloon , balloon catheter place tension tap external end patient 's inner thigh . Oxytocin start within 30 minute Foley balloon catheter placement , use standard intravenous oxytocin protocol . Additional manual traction Foley balloon catheter perform every 30 minute Foley balloon catheter expulsion . A sterile cervical exam perform spontaneous Foley catheter expulsion evaluate post-balloon cervical dilation . No procedure test specific study require beyond point ; data collection study outcomes remain course patient 's labor record .</detailed_description>
