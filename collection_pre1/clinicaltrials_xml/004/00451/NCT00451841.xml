	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) sole cause chronic cough 20-40 % case , majority patient GERD-induced cough classic `` heartburn '' symptom . This important cause cough thus difficult detect . Non-invasive radiologic test GERD barium swallow imperfectly sensitive subject GERD-induced cough . The 24 hour pH probe , continuously monitor esophageal pH correlate cough event reflux event , consider gold standard test . However , test expensive , invasive , universally available . The goal current study compare simultaneous measurement esophageal pH exhale breath condensate pH cough episode , patient symptomatic cough . The cause cough determine standard protocol , include 24 hour pH probe study , assessment asthma , upper airway cause sinus disease , medication effect . All subject undergo 24 hour pH monitoring . During monitoring period , press event button pH record device indicate cough episode . After six event , immediately perform EBC collection , EBC pH subsequently analyze . Differences pH change group cough cause GERD compare pH measurement group cough GERD , determine sensitivity specificity pH change discriminate two group , optimal threshold value pH change EBC .</detailed_description>
