	<brief_title>Intermittent Liposomal Amphotericin B Primary Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive Fungal Infections ( IFI ) significant cause death patient acute leukaemia undergoing chemotherapy . This despite improvement antifungal therapy treatment IFI . The major reason current standard diagnostic test culture biopsy lack ability make diagnosis , either early accurately . Thus strategy use prophylaxis need . Several antifungal agent trialled prophylaxis disadvantage limit effectiveness . Liposomal amphotericin B ( LAB ) broad spectrum antifungal agent kill fungal cell . When give high dos intermittently supersaturates liver overspill bloodstream absorb tissue lung , brain kidney ( i.e . sit IFI likely occur ) . This effect show number animal laboratory test-tube study reduce fungal burden , improve survival maintain adequate level drug dos . However intermittent high-dose prophylaxis study do human . Thus proceed randomise controlled clinical trial efficacy intermittent high-dose LAB compare another antifungal agent necessary determine phase 2 study 2 intermittent dose LAB regimen ( i.e . 3mg/kg three time week 10mg/kg week ) administer neutropenic phase induction-consolidation chemotherapy treatment acute leukaemia safest best tolerate compare standard dose regimen 1mg/kg daily LAB . Males female age &gt; 18 year undergoing intensive combination chemotherapy acute leukaemia randomise 1:1:1 either 1mg/kg daily ; 3mg/kg 3 time week 10mg/kg weekly intravenous liposomal amphotericin B . The 3 arm compare safety 3 dosing regimen .</detailed_description>
