	<brief_title>Intranasal Ketamine Procedural Sedation Pediatric Laceration Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedural sedation frequently use facilitate distress painful procedure pediatric emergency department . However , administer intramuscular medication place intravenous line give intravenous medication distress procedure . Oral medication generally take long work subject first-pass metabolism . Another alternative give medication intranasal route , require spray nose . Ketamine good sedative drug favorable quality , often use intramuscularly intravenously . It use intranasally pre-induction anesthetic , sedation CT scan , brief dental procedure , use yet demonstrate set pediatric emergency department procedural sedation . We compare three different dos ketamine , apply intranasally use mucosal atomization device , determine difference efficacy sedation , time onset sedation , duration sedation , caregiver physician satisfaction , number adverse event . We also use opportunity determine ketamine bioavailability give intranasally use mucosal atomization device .</detailed_description>
