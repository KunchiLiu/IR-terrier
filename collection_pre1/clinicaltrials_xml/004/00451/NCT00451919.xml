	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease inherit blood disorder affect red blood cell ( RBCs ) . People sickle cell disease frequently experience anemia , low number RBCs . RBCs responsible carry oxygen brain body tissue need oxygen function properly . The purpose study determine change , possibly cause anemia , exist brain individual sickle cell disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Link Between Anemia Deficits Memory Attention Individuals With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role RBCs carry oxygen lung brain body tissue . Individuals anemia unusually low number RBCs . They also often difficulty concentrate remember information , likely cause reduce oxygen supply brain . Previous research show correct anemia patient without sickle cell disease improve memory attention . The purpose study examine abnormal change brain individual sickle cell disease determine whether change relate reduced memory attention capability . Participants attend one study visit . During visit , brain magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) perform participant complete neuropsychological test measure memory , attention , organizational ability . There follow-up visit . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
