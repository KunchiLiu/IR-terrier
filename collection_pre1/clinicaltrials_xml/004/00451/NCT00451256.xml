	<brief_summary>For people heart by-pass surgery , vein use by-pass blockage , time , become narrowed possibly block . AVI-5126 block gene believe responsible event blood vessel cause narrowing . Therefore , expose vein AVI-5126 attach coronary artery may result less problem vein graft later . This study determine procedure safe effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study AVI-5126 When Used Vein Grafts Before Use Heart by-Pass Graft Surgery ( CABG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass ( CABG ) common procedure employ life-threatening cardiovascular disease . While bypass surgery effective restoring blood flow short-term , 30 50 percent venous bypass graft eventually become blocked fail . Within first year CABG procedure , estimate 15 30 % saphenous vein graft fail ( i.e. , ≥ 75 % reduction flow within graft ) , due intimal hyperplasia anastomosis site . There currently approve treatment prevent venous graft failure . These patient may frequently undergo second bypass surgery extent graft failure ( ) sufficiently severe lead uncontrolled angina pectoris . It clear second CABG procedure patient represent high operative mortality rate first procedure . Venous graft failure CABG major unmet medical-surgical problem . AVI previously focus Neugene® product area prevent cardiovascular stenosis . This application antisense target inhibit c-myc gene previously demonstrate prevent sequela intimal hyperplasia follow endovascular injury . The purpose study evaluate whether immersion excise saphenous vein novel anti-c-myc antisense drug ( AVI-5126 ) solution prevent subsequent graft failure 1 year , compare physiological saline ( placebo ) prior graft anastomosis .</detailed_description>
