	<detailed_description>Despite widespread use statin therapy reduce risk cardiovascular disease risk , considerable inter-individual variation statin efficacy , would desirable identify marker would predictive magnitude beneficial response . The effect statin strongly associate improved clinical outcome reduction LDL cholesterol . The CAP study six week non-randomized , open label study simvastatin 40 mg/day group 335 African-American 609 Caucasian volunteer subject . Measurements plasma lipid lipoprotein , well marker cardiovascular disease risk , obtain screen entry visit , four six week simvastatin treatment . Both baseline measurement change response simvastatin therapy use test association genetic polymorphism . Significant finding replicate study cohort .</detailed_description>
