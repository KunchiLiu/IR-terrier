	<brief_summary>Because hemodynamic safety , etomidate widely use anaesthesia induction cardiac surgery . It also cause adrenal insufficiency follow 48 hour ( 11 betahydroxylase inhibition ) . So could increase hemodynamic dysfunction cause SIRS follow cardiopulmonary bypass . A previous observational study find adrenal insufficiency need vasopressive support therapy etomidate group versus another propofol induce group . The aim work compare hemodynamic dysfunction follow induction etomidate cardiac surgery ECC . The control group would induce Propofol . 94 patient would include .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Operative Hemodynamic Function After Anesthetic Induction With Etomidate Cardiac Surgery With ECC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Information give anaesthetic consultation , week plan cardiac surgery . Eligibility exclusion criterion check . Patient receive informative write consent notice question answer . A standard pre-operative blood collection sample . In order minimize potential confusing effect daily cortisol variation , surgical procedure perform early morning consider . The day surgery definitive inclusion decide order procedure know . Only patient operate morning include cortisol daily variation . At time , consent information notice sign checked medical record . On morning surgery , venous catheter insertion additional blood sample collect ass basal cortisolemia . Randomisation carry centrally patient operative theatre admission , phone call ICU randomisation office . Hypnotic drug prepare ICU department next operative room blindly administer patient ( volume per weight ) . All anesthetic procedure standardise : opioid drug , vasopressive support , antifibrinolytics hemodynamic monitoring . After surgery patient admit surgical ICU . They undergo standard post operative exam plus two corticotrophin test dosage SIRS marker ( IL6 TNF alpha ) . These result know end study .</detailed_description>
