	<brief_summary>We assume etiology patellofemoral pain syndrome related mechanical property tendon structure vastus medialis obliquus vastus lateralis . Consequently , measure electromechanical delay viscoelastic parameter two muscle . Besides , also investigate effect exercise train mechanical property muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patellofemoral pain syndrome ( PFPS ) common knee disorder . From literature review , one may find inconsistent result among different research clinical study effect therapeutic exercise patient PFPS . A possible reason disagreement might lack clear etiology patellofemoral pain . At present , widely accept concept genesis patellofemoral pain abnormal lateral track patella . One factor cause maltracking soft tissue imbalance around patella . Previous study demonstrate inconsistency amplitude muscle activity time muscle fire vastus medialis obliquus ( VMO ) vastus lateralis ( VL ) may contribute imbalance soft tissue . Another neuromuscular condition , however , electromechanical delay VMO VL patent PFPS investigate extensively . We hypothesize people PFPS would longer electromechanical delay VMO VL . The objective three-year project compare electromechanical delay VMO VL people PFPS first year . In second year , investigate viscoelastic property tendon structure , key component induce electromechanical delay , VMO VL vivo . In last year , research effect exercise program mechanical property VMO VL people PFPS.We expect recruit 30 patient PFPS experimental group 30 healthy individual control group first second year . In third year , recruit 60 patient PFPS , 30 receive specific exercise program others control group . The evoked electromechanical delay VMO define time interval time VMO receive electrical stimulation onset time patellar movement due VMO contraction . The viscoelastic property tendon structure investigate ultrasonographic study voluntary contraction condition . The torque output isometric knee extension 80° flexion measure dynamometer . The subject instruct produce gradually increase force relaxed status maximal voluntary contraction within 5 second , follow gradual relaxation also within 5 second . Simultaneously , elongation deep aponeurosis VMO VL catch ultrasonic image synchronize torque signal clock timer subsequent analysis . The stiffness , Young 's modulus hysteresis tendon structure calculate represent viscoelastic property . Finally , subject prescribe 8-week exercise program EN-dynamic machine perform knee extension 45° 0° flexion . The training outcome assess electromechanical delay VMO VL . And also investigate effect exercise program mechanical property tendon structure .</detailed_description>
