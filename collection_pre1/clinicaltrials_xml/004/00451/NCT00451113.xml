	<brief_summary>Diabetes common elderly ; age 70 , approximately 25 % population diabetes . Unfortunately , currently available medication often effective well tolerate old adult . Sitagliptin new medication new class agent call incretins . Incretins many potential advantage treatment diabetes elderly . They stimulate insulin secretion , impaired old people diabetes . The incidence hypoglycemia currently available medication increase age , incretins rarely cause hypoglycemia . They assist weight loss , whereas many current medication use manage diabetes result weight gain elderly . They improve insulin action , insulin resistance major problem old people diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To date , clinical trial conduct specifically elderly , data note laboratory would imply inhibitor enzyme could effective elderly patient population . In addition , convincingly demonstrate diabetes elderly metabolically distinct diabetes middle age patient ( 1 ) . Thus , clear study warrant determine effectiveness drug class elderly patient diabetes . We propose series study DP4 inhibitor sitaglipitin determine efficacy safety elderly patient population diabetes .</detailed_description>
