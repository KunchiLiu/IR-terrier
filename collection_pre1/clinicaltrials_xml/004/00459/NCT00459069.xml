	<brief_summary>The main purpose study test safety dendritic cell tumor fusion study vaccine determine type severity side effect associate study vaccine . Cancer cell unique marker distinguish normal cell body . These marker potentially serve target immune system . Dendritic cell normally find small amount body responsible immune response `` foreign '' substance enter body . Animal study show fused cell stimulate powerful anti-tumor response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Dendritic Cell/Tumor Fusions Novel Tumor Vaccine Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To create study vaccine , cell remove participant tumor fuse ( mixed ) powerful immune system stimulate cell ( dendritic cell ) obtain participant blood . - Not everyone participate study receive amount study vaccine . A small group people enrol study give certain dose . If tolerate well , next group people enrol receive high dose . This continue high dose level tolerate determine . - Once screen test complete determined participant eligible , undergo baseline procedure . In effort make study vaccine , tumor cell dendritic cell collect participant . Tumor cell may collect bone marrow collection tumor cell call plasmacytoma . A decision make base upon location cancer . - A bone marrow aspiration/biopsy perform following time point : screening , prior first vaccination , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month final study vaccination . These use ass follow participant multiple myeloma . - Leukapheresis perform obtain dendritic cell . This procedure take 2 4 hour involve collection large number white blood cell . Dendritic cell generate laboratory white blood cell . If enough white blood cell collect , participant may ask return clinic additional leukapheresis procedure . - Before vaccine administer ( week 0 , 3 , 6 ) follow study test procedure perform : skin test ; blood test , physical exam 24-hour urine collection . A physical exam blood test perform week participant receive vaccine ( week 1,2,4,5,7,8 ) . - The study schedule consist fix dose fuse ( mixed ) cell vaccine skin every 3 week . Each study vaccine accompany injection GM-CSF . Participants receive 2 vaccine depend upon total number fusion cell make , dose participant assign receive response study vaccine . - Follow-up vaccine treatment complete consist following : blood collection ( 1 , 3 6 month final study vaccination ) ; bone marrow aspiration/biopsy ( 1 , 3 6 month final study vaccination ) ; physical exam ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 month final study vaccination ) ; radiologic tumor assessment ( 1 , 3 6 month final study vaccination .</detailed_description>
