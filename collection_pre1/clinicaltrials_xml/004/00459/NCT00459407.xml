	<brief_title>Defined Green Tea Catechins Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery Remove Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine bioavailability define green tea catechin extract prostate tissue treatment define green tea extract patient prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect treatment change clusterin level matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 MMP-9 prostate tissue patient . II . Determine effect treatment change serum insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 IGF bind protein-3 patient . III . Determine effect treatment change oxidative DNA damage peripheral blood leukocytes patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral define green tea catechin extract daily 4-7 week . Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily 4-7 week . All patient undergo surgery one day last dose study agent . Biopsies take time surgery . Plasma tissue catechin level measure high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . 8OHdG level peripheral blood measure HPLC mass spectometry . Immunohistochemistry used measure matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 , MMP-9 , clusterin . Insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 IGF bind protein-3 measure immunoenzyme technique .</detailed_description>
