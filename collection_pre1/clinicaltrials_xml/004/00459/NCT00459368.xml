	<brief_title>Using Information Technology Improve Asthma Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2001 estimate 31.1 million people United States report ever asthma diagnosis . Asthma lead cause preventable hospitalization , account estimate 14 million day miss school 100 million day restrict activity yearly . The routine use anti-inflammatory medication , particularly inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , treatment asthma markedly improve symptom reduce complication . Yet , evidence suggest medication under-prescribed physician poorly take patient . For example , one study asthma patient enrol large , California HMO 71.7 % patient severe symptom report steroid inhaler , 53.6 % report use daily precede month . Using electronic monitoring device record inhaler use , researcher estimate patient use ICS direct 20 73 % time . Using claims-based measure adherence show adherence inhaled steroid inversely correlate frequency oral steroid use asthma-related emergency room visit . In addition , measure suggest non-adherence ICS independent predictor asthma-related hospitalization . In study population , estimate 60 % asthma-related hospitalization attributable poor adherence ICS . Together finding suggest increase ICS use may improve asthma outcome . Studies employ health-behavioral model adherence suggest medication adherence associate treatment-related concern regard complication , efficacy , benefit . Unfortunately , result behavioral educational intervention improve adherence disappointing . Despite , case , considerable time spent patient , intervention best result modest adherence improvement . Given time , training , resource require implement intervention , unlikely widely adopt clinical setting . Some recent study , however , suggest provide adherence data clinician may improve patient adherence . In one , clinician give repeat feedback patient regard ICS adherence ; result sustained improvement study period . Unfortunately , small study find difference asthma outcome . In proposal seek test asthma adherence intervention specifically design use clinical setting . Adherence measure generate link currently available electronic data . In cluster-randomized trial , primary care physician-practice group randomize receive asthma medication adherence information electronically patient asthma associate practice . In addition ICS adherence information , clinicians intervention practice data patient beta-agonist use well tailor ICS therapy disease severity . Eligible patient asthma identify prior randomizing practice invite participate . Patient survey send pre-intervention survey post-intervention period . Patient-level outcome assess medical record , patient survey , claim data . We perform intention-to-treat analysis eligible patient identify pre-randomization include analysis ( primary analysis ) . This study power allow 60 % eligible patient population see within first 6-months ( i.e. , effect 40 % patient population ) . As secondary analysis , perform modify intention-to-treat ( per protocol ) analysis , whereby analyze result patient study arm see within first 6-months intervention .</detailed_description>
