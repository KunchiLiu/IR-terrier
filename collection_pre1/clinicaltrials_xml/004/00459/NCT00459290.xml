	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Progesterone cause growth ovarian epithelial cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer . Hormone therapy use mifepristone may fight ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal cancer lower amount progesterone body make . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well mifepristone work treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity mifepristone patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma . - Determine toxicity drug patient . Secondary - Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine potential impact platinum sensitivity , initial performance status , age prognosis patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral mifepristone daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 52 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
