	<brief_title>Prevention Mood Disorders Folic Acid Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder recurrent major depression life-long disabling illness often first become clinically apparent late teenage year early twenty . People develop clinical mood disorder characteristically milder , short-lived symptom mood disturbance prior onset clinical illness . These sub-clinical disturbance represent risk factor subsequent development clinical disorder ( Angst 2000 ; Aalto-Setala , 2002 ) . A number physiological abnormality associate depression persist symptom resolution , suggest depression may cause kind biological `` scarring '' brain predispose episode illness . Nutritional supplement feasible intervention primary prevention likely acceptable intuitively would seem great chance effective preventative stage , rather late disease progression occur . Folate mood disturbance Low plasma red cell folate long associated clinical depressive disorder treatment folic acid ( 500mcg daily ) show improve therapeutic effect fluoxetine depress patient ( see Coppen Bailey , 2000 ) . A grow number epidemiological study also suggest link low folate status , increase homocysteine depressive symptomatology general population ( Tiemeier et al , 2002 ; Bjelland et al , 2003 ; Morris et al , 2003 ) . Objectives Primary • To determine whether folic acid supplementation prevent new episode mood disorder teenage child parent recurrent depression bipolar disorder Secondary - To determine whether folic acid supplementation improve depression score Mood Feeling Questionnaire teenage child parent recurrent depression bipolar disorder - To determine whether folic acid supplementation improve score Altman Mania Rating Scale teenage child parent recurrent depression bipolar disorder - To determine whether correlation genotype folate enzyme response folate Endpoints Primary • Occurrence episode Axis 1 mood disorder DSM-IV determine Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) Secondary - Change Score The Mood Feeling Questionnaire - Change score Altman Mania Rating Scale - Correlation genotype folate enzyme response folate Study design This randomize , concealed allocation , placebo−controlled study mask participant investigator . Participants initially enter 4 week run−in phase take folic acid ( 2.5mg ) . If consent compliance maintain active run−in , participant randomise one two treatment parallel group design ( ) Folic acid ( 2.5mg daily ) ( b ) identical placebo liquid . A web-based algorithm use accessed researcher either online phone call study office . Access randomisation code limit trial programmer temporary access give another member trial team absence . The treatment period thirty six month . PRE−EMPT continue screen 200 teenager randomise phase , male female ( 14−24 year age ) biological parent life−time history recurrent major depression , bipolar I bipolar II disorder . Family history assess use proband question . Subjects exclude current past DSM−IV Axis I disorder . This assess use Structured Clinical Interview DSM−IV ( SCID ) . Current past sub−syndromal mood anxiety disorder reason exclusion assess use minimization process.We also exclude subject significant on−going medical condition , particularly epilepsy already use folate supplement unwilling give duration study . All subject give inform write consent study parent guardian also give write consent subject 16 year age . Minimization carry age , gender , family history presence sub−syndromal mood disturbance ensure balance treatment allocation . Ratings follow−up On entry study subject complete ten self−rating instrument , Mood Feeling Questionnaire ( MFQ ) , 32−item scale design detect monitor adolescent depression community ( Cooper Goodyer , 1993 ; Wood et al , 1995 ) . Subjects also complete Altman Mania Rating Scale , 5−item scale design mania ( Altman et al , 1997 ) , Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) , 5−item scale design detect severity insomnia ( Morin 1993 ) , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) 14 item scale determine anxiety depression ( Zigmond Snaith 1983 ) . Subsequently subject complete MFQ , Altman , ISI HADS monthly . We available web−based assessment write form , whichever participant prefers . The rating scale complete entry Cambridge Life Events Rating Scale ( CLE ) , Eysenck Personality Questionnaire ( EPQ ) , Response Styles Questionnaire ( RSQ ) , Parental Bonding Inventory ( PBI ) , Children 's Attributional Style Questionnaire ( CAS ) . Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire ( MEQ ) . At six monthly interval subject re−interviewed SCID ass whether met criterion DSM−IV Axis I disorder precede six month . The CLE CAS also repeat six monthly interval . Prior entry investigation ask subject provide blood sample follow : 1 . Full blood count , Red cell folate , B12 , homocysteine level 2 . DNA sample polymorphisms protein involve folate metabolism relate neurotransmitter . These measure ( apart DNA analysis ) repeat annually . Prior entry also wish ass wake salivary cortisol . In separate study find healthy young people parent history mood disorder ( ie participant population recruit study ) elevate wake level salivary cortisol relative controls.The measurement wake salivary cortisol simple non-invasive test may represent marker vulnerability depression . If case might alter folate treatment use present study decrease risk depression . We therefore propose ask subject take sample wake salivary cortisol begin folate/placebo treatment six month study . In way able assess effect folate/placebo treatment wake salivary cortisol . The eventual aim ass whether relative placebo folic acid treatment lower wake salivary cortisol whether associate decreased risk depression . From point view storage custody saliva sample treat exactly blood sample take folate estimation .</detailed_description>
