	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel poliglumex , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Estradiol may kill prostate cancer cell longer respond hormone therapy . Giving paclitaxel poliglumex together estradiol may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give paclitaxel poliglumex together estradiol work treat patient stage IV prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine PSA response rate patient androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer treat paclitaxel poliglumex transdermal estradiol . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine time PSA progression measurable disease progression patient treat regimen . - Determine time death cause patient treated regimen . - Correlate level serum estradiol , serum cathepsin B , bone turnover marker PSA response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive transdermal estradiol continuously ( patch change every 7 day ) PSA level rise . Patients whose PSA increase baseline PSA decrease &lt; 10 % 4 week estradiol therapy whose serum PSA reduction &lt; 50 % 12 week estradiol therapy also receive paclitaxel poliglumex therapy . These patient receive paclitaxel poliglumex IV 10-20 minute day 1 . Treatment paclitaxel poliglumex repeat every 28 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
