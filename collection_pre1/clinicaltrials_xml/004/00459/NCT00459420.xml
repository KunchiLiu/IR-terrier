	<brief_summary>Many patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) sleep problem , include excessive sleepiness day . This probably due degeneration sleep-regulating area brain . At present , treatment sleepiness PD modafinil , expensive partially effective . There another potential treatment sleepiness use worldwide , inexpensive , well tolerate safe - namely , caffeine . There also suggestion caffeine may slow progression degeneration PD , since coffee non-drinkers higher risk develop PD . PD patient , even severe sleepiness often use caffeine . It unclear whether PD make sleepiness unresponsive caffeine , tolerate , whether reflect lifelong habit non-use . This proposal outline trial patient excessive sleepiness give caffeine placebo ( therapy ) blind fashion . In way , effect caffeine sleepiness motor symptom directly analyze . In addition , finding use test tolerability caffeine , help plan larger-scale study test whether caffeine slow progression PD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caffeine Excessive Daytime Somnolence Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common neurodegenerative disorder characterize motor disability many disable non-motor symptom . Excessive daytime somnolence ( EDS ) find 50 % patient PD , cause considerable impairment quality life . At present , proven treatment EDS PD modafinil , alert agent unknown mechanism action . However , modafinil moderately effective expensive . Caffeine well tolerate inexpensive alerting agent use worldwide , patient PD use therapy EDS . It unclear whether help EDS PD , side effect , simply consider lifelong pattern non-use . If caffeine demonstrate effective agent EDS PD , likely become first-line agent EDS . This result considerable cost saving patient health care payer , well potentially help tolerate , respond , afford modafinil . Another compelling question interest patient PD whether caffeine may neuroprotective . Despite intensive research , treatment find slow progression neurodegeneration PD . Recently numerous epidemiologic study link lifelong use caffeine low risk PD . Although mechanism find unclear , support evidence animal model suggest true neuroprotective benefit caffeine strong possibility . Alternatively , caffeine could benefit motor manifestation PD , would prevent diagnosis PD . Any finding symptomatic benefit caffeine motor manifestation PD obvious important implication treatment person affect PD plan neuroprotective trial . Any finding neuroprotective benefit caffeine almost certainly result immediate widespread use PD , profound implication patient care . The present proposal double blind randomized placebo control crossover trial answer three important question PD : caffeine useful treatment EDS patient PD ? caffeine symptomatic effect motor manifestation PD ? , caffeine acceptable tolerability side effect profile allow plan eventual neuroprotective trial ? Patients PD EDS Epworth sleepiness scale &gt; 10 randomize caffeine therapy ( 100 mg twice per day three week , 200 mg twice per day three week ) placebo . A final assessment perform 4-week washout . A total 52 patient randomized two-year period . The primary outcome measure change Epworth sleepiness scale patient receive caffeine versus placebo . Secondary outcome measure include sleep scale , tolerability measure , measure motor function overall quality life . After test assess normal distribution , analysis two-sample t-test .</detailed_description>
