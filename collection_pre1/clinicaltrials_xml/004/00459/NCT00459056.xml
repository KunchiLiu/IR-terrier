	<brief_title>The Vascular Effects Carvedilol Controlled Release ( CR ) Abdominally Obese Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) popular choice treatment hypertension mainly due efficacy lower blood pressure , safety , cost-effectiveness . Similarly , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE-I ) , neutral positive impact glycemic control , popular choice address hypertension abdominally obese patient . Furthermore , ACE-I drug class show improve vascular endothelial function inflammation addition blood pressure lower effect . Conversely , beta-adrenergic receptor blocker ( b-blockers ) generally avoid first line anti-hypertensive therapy pre-diabetic patient due concern worsen glycemic control potential hastening progression type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . However , recent data show 3rd generation b-blocker carvedilol negatively affect glucose metabolism therefore may safe effective choice blood pressure control patient . This neutral glycemic effect likely due fact carvedilol non-selective b-receptor antagonist ( block b1 b2 receptor ) alpha1-receptor block property . In addition , carvedilol posse anti-oxidant property improve endothelial function , potentially make attractive anti-hypertensive treatment strategy patient abdominal obesity . The combination carvedilol lisinopril may especially effective reduce blood pressure may act synergistically address impaired vascular function increase inflammation oxidative stress present patient metabolic syndrome phenotype . Therefore primary objective current study evaluate effect carvedilol CR + lisinopril compare lisinopril + HCTZ vascular function head head trial abdominally obese , hypertensive patient . The secondary objective compare effect two anti-hypertensive therapy plasma biomarkers endothelial activation , inflammation , oxidative stress patient .</detailed_description>
