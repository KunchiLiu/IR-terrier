	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy sunitinib malate patient locally recurrent metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 2 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
