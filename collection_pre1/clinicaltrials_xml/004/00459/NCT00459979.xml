	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine percentage patient renal cell carcinoma unresectable primary tumor achieve sufficient tumor response , accord operating surgeon , undergo nephrectomy sunitinib therapy . - To evaluate safety sunitinib patient renal cell carcinoma unresectable primary tumor , include analysis morbidity surgery sunitinib therapy - To evaluate objective response rate patient renal cell carcinoma unresectable primary tumor receive sunitinib therapy . OUTLINE : A single arm phase II study sunitinib patient unresectable renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) conduct , include patient without distant metastasis . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Surgery perform primary tumor become resectable . Patients residual and/or metastatic disease may resume sunitinib malate within 8 week surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 31 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm renal cell carcinoma ( histology ) base prior biopsy biopsy perform review Cleveland Clinic Foundation . This include pathology read adenocarcinoma consistent renal origin . Unresectable primary tumor due follow factor various combination thereof : Large tumor size ( &gt; 15 cm ) Bulky lymphadenopathy ( &gt; 4 cm encasement renal vessel great vessel ) Venous thrombosis ( high level/invasive disease require inferior vena cava reconstruction hypothermic circulatory arrest ) Proximity vital structure ( e.g. , mesenteric vasculature ) Any one factor may may constitute unresectability , consideration trial , surgical medical oncologist must agree particular constellation finding patient consideration would likely entail low probability ( &lt; 50 % ) tumor would resectable ( negative margin ) potential morbidity associate attempt surgical resection would clinically acceptable . The numerical threshold note guideline clinical judgment surgeon medical oncologist determine unresectability . Patients history brain metastasis enrol 2 week follow completion gamma knife whole brain radiotherapy . ECOG performance status ( PS ) 01 Karnofsky PS &gt; /=70 % Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL ( transfusion allow ) Serum calcium ≤ 12.0 mg/dL Creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure .
