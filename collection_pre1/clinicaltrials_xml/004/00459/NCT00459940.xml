	<brief_title>The Effects TZD Fat Metabolism Insulin Sensitivity GH-Replaced GHD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In human subject GH ( Growth Hormone ) acutely antagonise effect insulin glucose uptake skeletal muscle increase hepatic glucose production human . This clinical implication patient active acromegaly , prevalence glucose intolerance overt diabetes mellitus increase . It also significance relation GH replacement therapy GH-deficient adult least consider substantial proportion patient insulin resistant GH-untreated state . There evidence indicate acute insulin antagonistic effect may balance time favourable effect GH body composition physical fitness , data ambiguous . The mechanism underlying effect GH fully characterise , experimental evidence causal link concomitant stimulation lipolysis , since GH-induced insulin resistance partly abrogate lipolysis pharmacologically suppress . This noteworthy since elevate level free fatty acid ( FFA ) also implicate pathogenesis insulin resistance patient metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes mellitus . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) insulin sensitizer function highaffinity agonist nuclear peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) gamma , improve insulin sensitivity T2DM . PPAR gamma nuclear receptor express mainly adipocytes , activate transcription gene involve lipid glucose metabolism . Administration TZD T2DM enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via mechanism include lower circulate FFA redistribution fat away hepatocytes myocytes peripheral adipocytes . To knowledge , impact TZDs GH-induced insulin resistance previously report . Experimental data human subject issue potential importance relation patient abnormal GH status , also regard understand pathogenesis insulin resistance general complex action PPAR gamma activation particular .</detailed_description>
