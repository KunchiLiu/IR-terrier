	<brief_summary>This study test well new contrast agent ( dye ) use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) help visualize totally blocked artery normally supply blood neck , arm legs . Currently use agent work well visualize normal partly block artery ( artery blood flow ) , poorly totally blocked artery . This study see contrast agent call gadofosveset well brighten image completely block artery . Gadofosveset approve Europe use MRI scan , still consider experimental United States . People 18 year age old know suspected total blockage artery neck , arm leg may eligible study . Participants undergo MRI scanning gadofosveset contrast dye . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . For procedure , subject lie table slide tubular scanner , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan process . The procedure last 1.5 2 hour , subject may ask hold breath several time long 5 20 second . During procedure , gadofosveset inject several kind MRI picture take understand well new agent work . Subjects may ask undergo second scan use conventional MRI contrast dye</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Totally Blocked Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repairing totally occluded peripheral artery remain challenge visualize use available image technology . Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography ( CE-MRA ) , X-ray compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) , invasive radiocontrast digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) rely blood flow within artery totally occlude . Where arterial lumen totally occlude , contrast enter artery remain invisible . As result , physician difficulty identify pathway trajectory catheter device order improve blood flow use angioplasty . Gadofosveset , albumin-binding MRI contrast agent commercially available outside United States , may accumulate wall occluded artery mechanism know . The goal protocol determine whether gadofosveset value planning catheter trajectory totally occlude peripheral artery . We propose study gadofosveset contrast enhancement pattern occlude peripheral artery segment 20 patient know occluded iliac , femoral , shoulder artery consider catheter-based treatment . This research may value plan conduct minimally invasive treatment use conventional X-ray guidance possibly future use investigational real-time MRI guidance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects know cardiovascular disease eligible participation protocol . The subject eligible follow condition : Subject 's age great 18 year age . Known occlusion iliac , femoral , brachiocephalic artery . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects absolute contraindication MRI scan exclude . These contraindication include subject follow device : Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator . Central nervous system aneurysm clip . Implanted neural stimulator . Cochlear implant . Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) . Insulin pump . Metal shrapnel bullet . When subject provide evidence implanted device label compatible MRI , exception exclusion make recorded note . Furthermore , certain subject group exclude administration MRI contrast agent . The weight limit related availability investigational contrast agent . Because recent concern Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis/Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy gadobenate exposure patient endstage renal disease , renal excretory function determine patient severe renal excretory dysfunction exclude research protocol . Pregnant woman ( subject uncertain whether pregnant require quantitative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour ) lactate woman . Subjects experience allergic reaction gadoliniumbased contrast agent . Subjects hemoglobinopathy . Weight great 120 kg . Subjects renal disease ( eGFR less 30 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) , receive renal replacement therapy ) . The creatinine clearance estimate subject estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) use abbreviate MDRD Formula .</criteria>
