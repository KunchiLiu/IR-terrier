	<brief_summary>In research study , researcher compare combination docetaxel Zactima docetaxel alone see combination two drug effective docetaxel alone . Zactima block action three substance body : 1 ) vascular endothelial growth factor reception ( VEGFR ) ; 2 ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ; 3 ) rearrange transfection ( RET ) . VEGFR stimulate growth new blood vessel . When certain protein bind VEGF receptor , process begin occur allow new blood vessel make provide blood cancer cell . Zactima think block protein bind VEGF receptor , would block process create new blood vessel . EGFR control quickly cell grow multiply . RET think particularly significant role development growth squamous cell tumor . The action Zactima different way standard chemotherapy drug work . Researchers believe Zactima might different side effect cancer treatments another one purpose study assess side effect cause drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Combination With Zactima ( ZD6474 ) Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants `` randomize '' one follow study group : Docetaxel Docetaxel Zactima . Randomization mean participant put group chance . - The Docetaxel group receive docetaxel first day every treatment cycle , last 3 week . Even though treatment occur every three week , participant return clinic weekly basis first two cycle . After first two cycle , return clinic start cycle . - The combination Docetaxel Zactima group also receive docetaxel every three week . In addition docetaxel , also take Zactima pill orally every morning . They also return clinic weekly basis docetaxel group . - The following test procedure perform cycle treatment , regardless group participant randomize . These consider standard care treat patient chemotherapy recurrent head neck cancer : physical exam ; blood test ; urine test ; nasopharyngoscopy ; repeat image tumor ( x-ray , CT , MRI PET ) ; photographs tumor . In addition test mention , Zactima group EKGs perform 3 time first day treatment , week 2 , begin cycle 2 3 , every 6 week . - Participants continue study long receive benefit experience unmanageable side effect .</detailed_description>
