	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect drug call betahistine appetite food intake overweight woman . Betahistine use many year treat vertigo ( dizziness ) . It take market United States 1970 think ineffective vertigo , still use purpose many country . Some research suggest betahistine may reduce appetite food intake . Healthy overweight woman 18 50 year age may eligible study . Candidates must body mass index ( BMI ) 30 40 weigh less 300 pound . They screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , breathe test eat behavior questionnaire . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 3-day/2-night stay follow procedure : - Medication : Subjects take either betahistine ( one three possible dos ) placebo capsule one time day admission Clinical Center ( day 1 ) , three time day 2 two time day 3 . - Blood test 24-hour urine collection . - Resting metabolic rate : Subjects rest quietly 1 hour awaken rest clear plastic hood wear face mask , breathe normally 25 minute . - DEXA scan measure body fat , muscle , bone mineral content : Subjects lie table source X-rays small dose X-rays pass body . - Meal study : Subjects food intake measure day 2 3 . - Questionnaires : Subjects complete questionnaire hungry full feeling rate much like food ate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current medication long-term treatment obesity moderately effective best . Therefore , research focus compound affect energy balance novel mechanism warrant . Preliminary human animal data suggest central nervous system histaminergic tone important regulation food intake . We therefore propose study effect betahistine hydrochloride , histamine analogue agonist activity histaminergic H1 receptor antagonist/reverse agonist activity H3 receptor . Prior animal study suggest betahistine suppresses food intake reduces body weight , sparse human data assess effect betahistine metabolism . Betahistine effect woman food intake metabolism evaluate inpatient randomize double-blind placebo control dose-ranging study . We examine acute effect betahistine food intake , hunger , satiety , rest energy expenditure , hormone substrate relevant body weight regulation . If result suggest betahistine salutary effect food intake metabolism human , study lay groundwork additional investigation assess efficacy betahistine treatment obesity .</detailed_description>
