	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate response rate ( complete partial response ) 4 month patient unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treat dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine median PFS overall survival patient treated drug . II . Assess toxicity tolerability drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3-6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
