	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Meningitis Vaccine HIV-Infected Children Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , youth 2 24 year age high risk bacterial meningitis infection . Despite antibiotic treatment , mortality rate meningitis sepsis reach high 53 % cause Neisseria meningitidis . This rate could higher immunocompromised individual , infect HIV . To prevent infection , vaccination meningitis recommend CDC age 11 , 15 , 18 . The quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4 ) vaccine observe elicit appropriate immune response N. meningitidis approve FDA January 2005 . However , date , study do determine safety immunogenicity vaccine HIV-infected individual . The purpose study determine safety immunogenicity MCV4 HIV-infected youth 2 24 year age . The study originally design participant follow 72 week . Participants enrol three group age CD4 % follow : Group 1 : Age 11 24 year , CD4 % 15 % high . Enrollment stratify CD4 % : 15 % &lt; 25 % , &gt; = 25 % . Group 2 : Age 11 24 year , CD4 % &lt; 15 % . Group 3 : Age 2 10 year , CD4 % 25 % high . At study entry , study participant receive one injection MCV4 ( Step 1 ) . Participants observe 30 minute post-injection monitor adverse event . A clinic visit require 24 hour post-injection participant report adverse event . At Week 24 , participant Group 1 experience disqualify adverse event first injection randomly assign receive second injection MCV4 injection . Group 2 , Group 3 participant disqualify adverse event first injection receive second injection MCV4 Week 24 ( Step 2 ) . There five study visit Steps 1 2 ; occur study entry Weeks 4 , 24 , 28 , 72 . At visit , physical exam , assessment HIV-related symptom , blood collection occur . In addition , study participant contact telephone Days 3 7 Weeks 1 , 6 , 25 first vaccination . Participants Groups 1B 2 received second injection contact telephone Weeks 30 48 . As November 2010 , due data study ( P1065 ) recommendation Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) Center Disease Control ( CDC ) , eligible participant Groups 1 ( 1A 1B ) 3 P1065 receive booster dose MCV4 approximately 3.5 year ( +/- 6 month ) initial MCV4 vaccination . Participants observe 30 minute post-injection monitor adverse event . Participants also observe Week 1 vaccine adverse reaction . This portion study ( Step 3 ) last additional 24 week . There 4 study visit ; occur entry , Days 7-8 , Weeks 4 24 . At visit , physical exam , assessment HIV-related symptom , blood collection occur . The purpose follow-up study determine safety immunogenicity MCV4 booster dose HIV-infected participant previously receive one two MCV4 vaccination study .</detailed_description>
