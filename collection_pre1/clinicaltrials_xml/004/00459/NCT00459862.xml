	<brief_title>Pazopanib Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect pazopanib hydrochloride proportion patient malignant pleural mesothelioma progression-free 6 month base RECIST criterion . II . Determine clinical toxicity drug patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective tumor response status patient measure RECIST criterion modify RECIST criterion . II . Determine response rate patient treat drug . III . Determine effect drug overall survival time progression patient . IV . Assess predictive marker activity drug patient . V. Assess serologic marker target inhibition drug patient . VI . Determine clinical toxicity drug patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect baseline prior course therapy analyze marker angiogenesis . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
