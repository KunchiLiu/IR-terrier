	<brief_title>Study Antitumor Activity Capecitabine Combination With Erlotinib Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 150,000 people diagnosed colorectal cancer United States year . Forty fifty thousand people eventually develop metastatic colorectal cancer 40,000 people die annually advanced metastatic colorectal cancer . Cancer patient prefer oral therapy intravenous therapy palliative treatment efficacy regard response rate response duration compromise . Therefore , development completely oral combination therapy approximate improves upon clinical outcome attain reference triple drug therapy research priority . Compared intravenous 5-fluourouracil/leucovorin first-line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer , oral capecitabine demonstrate similar survival outcome ( approximately 12-13 month ) , response rate ( 15-20 % ) , response duration ( 4-5 month ) two multi-institutional international randomize phase III trial . Erlotinib ( OSI-774 , Tarceva ) orally available inhibitor human EGFR tyrosine kinase . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) overexpressed variety human cancer include colorectal cancer . The principal goal anticancer treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib restore normal cellular growth interrupt EGFR mediate cell proliferation malignant The hypothesis phase II trial unique mechanisms action non-overlapping toxicity profile capecitabine ( Xeloda ) erlotinib allow drug combine safe tolerable regimen well activity regard response , response duration , median survival capecitabine alone patient previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
