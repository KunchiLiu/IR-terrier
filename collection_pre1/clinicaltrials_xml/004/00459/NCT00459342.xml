	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Stage IIIB , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival 12 week patient stage IIIB IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treat dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine rate response patient treated drug . II . Examine relationship clinical response drug epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutational status , EGFR copy number , pSrc expression level pre-treatment tumor biopsy . III . Determine toxicity drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Previously obtain paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sample analyze polymerase chain reaction fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) epidermal growth factor receptor immunohistochemistry pSrc expression .</detailed_description>
