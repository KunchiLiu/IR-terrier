	<brief_summary>This main purpose study understand difference distribution drug-metabolizing enzyme genetic polymorphism among Taiwan ethnicity . The subject study include Atayal , Pawlan , Yami , Tsou , Ami , Minnan Hakka . We anticipate establish reference clinical medication various ethnic group accord difference distribution genetic polymorphism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It show medication cause different response different individual . In addition environment , diet , physical condition , genetic variation play important role various response . For instant , genetic variation drug-metabolism enzyme may responsible different ability drug metabolism . Some people high drug-metabolizing enzyme activity certain drug may need high dose reach effective therapy ; poor metabolize drug , may cause adverse drug reaction . Genetic variation also may cause different function cell transporter . The notable example tumor cell kind transporter call p-glycoprotein pump anti-tumor drug extracellular , turn tumor cell become resistant drug . Hence , elucidate gene variation individual , give individual different therapy base genetic variation . This approach call 「individualized medicine」 . In order reach goal individualized medicine , many study focus drug-metabolizing enzyme genetic variation race ethnicity . Especially , single nucleotide polymorphism provide important basis clinical medication . N- acetyltransferase 2 ( NAT2 ) one kind drug-metabolizing enzyme single nucleotide polymorphisms remarkable effect drug-metabolism . Only 10~30 % slow acetylators Asian population , 40~70 % find Caucasian population . Cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 , CYP ) another important drug-metabolizing enzyme family . Among family , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 play key role drug metabolism . Many literature show three enzyme various distribution SNPs different race . It indicate different race may different ability drug-metabolizing enzyme . Therefore , important provide strategy overcome difficulty individualize medicine . In previous study , scientist often take Chinese representative Asian people Minnan/ Hakka so-called Han people subject study Taiwan ethnicity . The genetic variation Taiwan aborigine poorly investigate . It show remarkable genetic variation human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) Taiwan aborigines Minnan/ Hakka Lin ML colleague . They highly homogenous within tribe , diversified among different tribe due long-term isolation . Therefore , expect establish database genetic variation drug-metabolism enzyme among group order use basis clinical medication . This study include seven group , 50 independent sample drug-metabolizing enzyme genetic polymorphism analysis . The important enzyme , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 NAT2 , etc. , study project . ABI 7900HT instrument traditional polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) use SNPs analysis , gene sequence also would use confirm result .</detailed_description>
