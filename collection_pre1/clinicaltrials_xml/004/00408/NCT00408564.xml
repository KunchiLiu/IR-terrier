	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , oxaliplatin , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sometimes chemotherapy give , stop growth tumor cell . The tumor say resistant chemotherapy . Giving cetuximab together chemotherapy may reduce drug resistance allow tumor cell kill . Giving cetuximab chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cetuximab together oxaliplatin gemcitabine follow surgery external-beam radiation therapy capecitabine work treat patient locally advance , nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine progression-free survival rate patient unresectable , locally advanced , nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas treat neoadjuvant therapy comprise cetuximab , gemcitabine hydrochloride , oxaliplatin follow either surgery chemoradiotherapy comprise external-beam radiotherapy capecitabine . Secondary - Determine toxicity tolerability regimen patient . - Determine overall survival progression-free survival . - Determine response rate patient . - Determine response duration ( defined time first observation response time progressive disease ) patient achieve least partial response treatment . - Determine biomarker response CA19-9 . OUTLINE : This open-label study . - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 8 , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute day 1 , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients evaluated completion neoadjuvant therapy . Patients metastatic disease take study . Beginning within 4 week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient resectable disease proceed surgical resection chemoradiotherapy ( choice ) ; patient unresectable disease proceed chemoradiotherapy . - Surgery : Patients undergo surgical resection Whipple procedure . - Chemoradiotherapy : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily 5 day week ( day 1-5 ) undergo external-beam radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5½ week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 42 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
