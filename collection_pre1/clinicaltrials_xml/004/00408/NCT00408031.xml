	<brief_summary>For many depression patient treatment change require , include switch another antidepressant addition second antidepressant non-antidepressant agent ( `` augmentation '' ) . The need modify treatment usually necessary partial response first-line monotherapy failure achieve remission although treatment response ( improvement ) obtain . These caveat presently available antidepressant drug highlight need innovative pharmacological treatment strategy . Recent data suggest N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) antagonists partial agonist NMDAR-associated glycine bind site may represent novel type antidepressant medication . These type compound protect vulnerable neuron variety insult , include stress-induced damage , may serve enhance maintain normal synaptic connectivity . In animal model , compound mimic effect clinically effective antidepressant . Furthermore , down-regulation glycine site NMDAR find common feature currently use antidepressant medication . D-cycloserine ( DCS , Seromycin ) broad spectrum antibiotic , use thirty year tuberculosis , act partial agonist NMDAR-associated glycine site . Beneficial antidepressant effect report 500-1000 mg/day DCS regimens depressed tuberculosis patient recent preliminary finding suggest DCS may also beneficial treatment major depressive disorder . The antidepressant effect DCS seem reflect consequence capacity reduce NMDAR receptor function . In present project , propose ass , use random assignment , parallel-group , double blind , placebo control design , effect NMDAR -antagonist DCS dose regimen , 250 -- &gt; 1000 mg/day 6 wks , adjuvant pharmacotherapy treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patient . The study methodology include assessment DCS effect upon symptom profile , neurocognitive test performance , amino acid serum level , brain electrophysiology parameter associate prepulse inhibition-startle response paradigm . It hypothesize significant beneficial DCS treatment effect register .</brief_summary>
