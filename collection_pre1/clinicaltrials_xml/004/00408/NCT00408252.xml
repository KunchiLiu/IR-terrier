	<brief_summary>Preclinical study well phase I II trial demonstrate SU11248 antitumor activity renal cell carcinoma , breast cancer , neuroendocrine tumor GIST . So light pre-clinical clinical data , seem interesting promising test SU011248 poor prognosis patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy SU 011248 Head And Neck Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label phase II , multicenter study . Eligible patient receive SU011248 monotherapy ( 37.5 mg give continuously without interruption ) . Tumor check-up perform every 6-8 week . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity accord patient investigator ( median treatment renal cell study 8 month ) . Since , head neck tumor easily accessible iterative biopsy , study offer opportunity get tumor biopsy SU011248 . Our study allow translational research biopsy crucial timing : baseline treatment , , treatment SU011248 ( cycle 1 , week 4 6 ) , patient stable disease partial response , new biopsy perform time disease progression try understand mechanism tumor resistance .</detailed_description>
