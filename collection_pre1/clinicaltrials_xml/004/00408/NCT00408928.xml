	<brief_title>Study Safety Effectiveness VELCADE® Treatment Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) serious complication bone marrow transplantation another donor . GVHD cause certain cell call lymphocyte . Normally cell make immune reaction help protect body foreign substance cause infection . Here , cell attack normal tissue body foreign substance . This interfere normal function vital organ result damage . In GVHD cell attack skin , liver bowel . GVHD also increase chance infection . VELCADE® drug inhibits certain immune reaction happen lymphocytes encounter foreign substance . We research determine VELCADE® may useful treat GVHD . VELCADE® approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least two prior therapy demonstrate disease progression last therapy . Its effectiveness also test cancer . The dose drug use research study use treatment multiple myeloma . It approve FDA use GVHD . Therefore , use VELCADE® GVHD experimental research study .</detailed_description>
