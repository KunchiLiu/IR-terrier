	<brief_summary>Postmenopausal woman history breast cancer often suffer climacteric symptom hot flush sweat episode . Conventional hormone therapy allow patient indication hormone may cause breast cancer recur . Tibolone steroid estrogenic , progestogenic androgenic activity register treatment climacteric complaint . Tibolone pharmacologic clinical profile different conventional hormone . In contrast conventional hormone , tibolone increase breast density cause less breast pain . The LIBERATE study study safety efficacy tibolone investigate postmenopausal woman treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Livial Intervention Following Breast Cancer ; Efficacy , Recurrence Tolerability Endpoints ( LIBERATE ) ( COMPLETED ) ( P05885 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A grow proportion woman diagnose early stage breast cancer seek help vasomotor sexual complaint . Frequently , symptom result adjuvant cancer treatment , irrespectively whether hormonal ( e.g . tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitor ) , cytotoxic , surgical ( oophorectomy ) nature . Estrogen-containing hormone therapy effective , consider unsafe . Non-hormonal therapy less effective . Tibolone , increase mammographic breast density , proven effective thus could important treatment option woman persistently seek help . The objective trial demonstrate safety , efficacy tolerability oral 2.5 mg tibolone daily breast cancer patient , , surgery , evidence disease suffer climacteric complaint . Primary study endpoint breast cancer recurrence , include primary contralateral breast cancer . Secondary outcome variable include menopausal symptom , bone mineral density health-related quality life . Patients eligible study surgically treat within previous 5 year histologically confirm T1-3 , N0-2 , M0 breast cancer vasomotor symptom , last menstruation least 12 month ( bilateral oophorectomy ) . The LIBERATE Trial design show non-inferiority tibolone compare placebo . Adequate sample size estimate least 1500 subject arm , assume breast cancer recurrence rate 5 % per year first 3 year dropout rate 5 % per year . The LIBERATE Study successfully include appropriate number woman proper risk profile significant result obtain relation safety efficacy tibolone breast cancer patient menopausal complaint .</detailed_description>
