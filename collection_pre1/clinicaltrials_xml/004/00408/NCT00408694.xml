	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together cisplatin , radiation therapy , fluorouracil work treat patient stage IIB , stage III , stage IVA , stage IVB nasopharyngeal cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth nasopharyngeal cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving bevacizumab together chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability bevacizumab chemoradiotherapy comprise cisplatin radiotherapy follow adjuvant therapy comprise cisplatin , fluorouracil , bevacizumab patient stage IIB-IVB nasopharyngeal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 1- 2-year rate locoregional progression-free patient treat regimen . II . Determine 1- 2-year rate distant metastases-free patient treat regimen . III . Determine 1- 2-year rate progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . BEVACIZUMAB AND CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute cisplatin IV 20-30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning week 1 , patient also undergo three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy daily 5 day week total 33 fraction . ADJUVANT THERAPY : Beginning week 10 , patient receive fluorouracil IV continuously 96 hour day 1-4 , cisplatin IV 20-30 minute day 1 OR day 1 2 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
