	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Study With Carboplatin &amp; Paclitaxel Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study determine addition bevacizumab regimen carboplatin/paclitaxel increase time disease recurrence ( long remission patient ) woman Stage III suboptimally reduce Stage IV ovarian cancer . The hypothesis addition bevacizumab carboplatin/paclitaxel regimen increase progression free survival subject Stage III suboptimal cytoreduced Stage IV ovarian cancer . Scientific Background Significance : Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) find tissue , know regulate angiogenesis normal ( e.g . ovulation ) abnormal ( e.g . malignant tumor ) condition . VEGF find overexpressed several tumor type , include breast , bladder , uterine , cervical , relevant application , primary metastatic tumor patient advanced ovarian cancer . It widely believe overexpression factor contribute tumorigenesis supply conduit oxygen nutrient reach feed grow malignancy . Treatment anti-VEGF antibody may help exert direct anti-angiogenic effect bind clear VEGF tumor microenvironment , thus prevent formation new blood vessel . Bevacizumab recombinant humanize anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody inhibit growth number human cancer , include ovarian cancer . Additional antitumor activity may obtain effect bevacizumab tumor vasculature , interstitial pressure , blood vessel permeability , could allow enhanced delivery concurrently administer chemotherapeutic agent tumor cell . Based preliminary data ( Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 2005 ; 23 : A5000 A 5009 ) , biologic rationale use bevacizumab treatment advance ovarian cancer . These 2 preliminary study report improved progression-free survival patient recurrent ovarian cancer use bevacizumab combination chemotherapy . Based activity recurrent setting , activity bevacizumab need evaluate chemotherapy-na√Øve patient advanced ovarian cancer . The purpose clinical trial determine whether addition bevacizumab regimen carboplatin paclitaxel significantly improve Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) patient Stage III suboptimally cytoreduced Stage IV ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma . It apparent newer innovative therapy need front line set decrease recurrence improve survival . The addition bevacizumab , anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody , standard carboplatin/taxol treatment paradigm might help increase long-term survival rate patient newly diagnose advanced suboptimal ovarian cancer . The propose study address issue . The investigational plan utilized test hypothesis addition bevacizumab extend survival time affect patient outline . Women Stage III IV ovarian cancer/primary peritoneal cancer/fallopian tube cancer undergone surgery residual suboptimally cytoreduced disease ( suboptimal define &gt; 1cm disease ) eligible treatment one 21-day cycle carboplatin paclitaxel five 21-day cycle bevacizumab , carboplatin paclitaxel total six treatment cycle ; bevacizumab treatment delay one cycle ensure adequate post-surgical healing . Subjects evaluate CT scan determine response therapy ; individual progress withdrawn study . The CT scan conduct completion therapy dictate next course action . Patients demonstrate complete response maintain bevacizumab consolidation therapy ; subject demonstrate partial response continue receive bevacizumab , carboplatin paclitaxel . The total treatment time patient clinical response follow initial 6 cycle therapy 12 month . Prior start consolidation therapy , patient complete clinical response surgery may result complete secondary cytoreduction , give option undergo second look surgery . The finding surgery combination CT scan determine response initial therapy . The decision participate second look surgery affect follow-up treatment patient receive .</detailed_description>
