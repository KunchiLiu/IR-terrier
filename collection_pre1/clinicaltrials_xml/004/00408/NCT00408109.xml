	<brief_summary>This study determine experimental avian flu ( bird flu ) vaccine safe , whether side effect stimulate immune response people . The vaccine test study make DNA ( genetic material ) cod influenza protein call hemagglutinin 5 ( H5 ) , base protein bird flu virus . The study determine body create resistance immunity H5 protein . The hope immune response protein may protect bird flu virus infection . Healthy people 18 60 year old vaccinate current season 's influenza vaccine may eligible study . Participants randomly assign receive injection one following : 1 ) study vaccine 1 mg dose , 2 ) study vaccine 4 mg dose , 3 ) placebo ( salt-water solution ) . They receive three injection 4 week apart upper arm muscle . Participants record temperature symptoms home 5 day injection , either diary card electronically use Internet , report side effect study physician nurse soon possible . They return NIH clinic visit every 2 week first 12 week , week 26 week 42 check health change problem . Blood drawn visit urine sample collect week 10 . If participant develop serious side effect , study physician may decide receive injection . However , participant ask continue follow-up visit even get full set three injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity recombinant DNA vaccine influenza virus hemagglutinin H5 . The hypothesis vaccine safe human administration elicit antibody T cell response H5 protein . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability investigational vaccine 1-mg 4-mg dose healthy adult . Secondary exploratory objective relate immunogenicity study vaccine . Product Description : The vaccine compose single closed-circular DNA plasmid encodes H5 protein CMV/R promoter . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each vaccination 1 mL administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle use Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) . The placebo diluent phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) . Subjects : A total 45 healthy adult , age 18-60 year , enrol . Study Plan : Subjects simultaneously randomize ratio 1:1:1 one two dosage group placebo group . Subjects clinicians blind group assignment . All subject receive 3 injection schedule show schema . The protocol require nine clinic visit three telephone follow-up contact . Study Duration : Each participant complete 42 week clinical follow . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety tolerability regimen . The secondary immunogenicity endpoint H5-specific antibody measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) assay Study Week 12 . H5-specific T cell response measure intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) assay , enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay immunogenicity assay timepoints throughout study may also complete exploratory evaluation .</detailed_description>
