	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Adalimumab Subjects With Moderately Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial design evaluate efficacy safety adalimumab ( ADA ) patient moderately severely active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . The duration study 65 week , include Screening Period 3 week , double-blind ( DB ) placebo-controlled treatment period 52 week , 70 day follow-up phone call participant prematurely discontinue enroll extension study NCT # 00573794 ( M10-223 ) . Adult participant moderate severe UC ( Mayo score 6 12 point endoscopy subscore 2 3 point ) , confirm colonoscopy biopsy flexible sigmoidoscopy biopsy , enrol approximately 120 site worldwide . Planned enrollment 500 participant . Participants stratify prior exposure infliximab and/or anti-TNF agent , randomize 1:1 ratio receive ADA placebo subcutaneous injection . Participants assign ADA treatment arm receive induction dose 160 mg Week 0 80 mg Week 2 , 40 mg every week ( eow ) start Week 4 . Participants assign placebo treatment arm receive match placebo period time . At Week 10 , participant meet criterion inadequate response could switch open-label ( OL ) ADA 40 mg eow begin Week 12 . Inadequate response define : - Partial Mayo score great equal Baseline score 2 consecutive visit least 14 day apart ( participant partial Mayo score 4 7 Baseline ) . - Partial Mayo score great equal 7 2 consecutive visit least 14 day apart ( participant partial Mayo score 8 9 Baseline ) . Participants demonstrate inadequate response 2 consecutive visit least 14 day apart OL administration ADA 40 mg eow permit dose escalate ADA 40 mg weekly ( ew ) . Participants persistent inadequate response ADA 40 mg ew may discontinue study Investigator 's discretion . Upon completion study , participant option enroll OL extension Study M10-223 could receive ADA treatment . Efficacy safety measurement perform throughout study . A follow-up phone call make 70 day last dose study drug obtain information ongoing new adverse event ( AEs ) participant terminate early enroll OL extension study .</detailed_description>
