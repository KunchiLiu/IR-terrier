	<brief_title>Efficacy Combined PEV3A Virosomal Vaccine FP9-MVA ME-TRAP Prime Boost Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two vaccine ( ‘ FP9 ME-TRAP ’ ‘ MVA ME-TRAP ’ ) design University Oxford . The vaccine ( PEV3A ) design jointly Swiss Tropical Institute Swiss company call Pevion Biotech Ltd . These new vaccine give limited number people . We aim test vaccine : - assess ability prevent malaria infection - determine good trigger detectable immune response malaria - study safety Volunteers give six vaccination three month expose malaria infection . We allow mosquito infect malaria bite closely regulated condition observe develop blood stage malaria . If vaccine provide protection malaria infection either develop malaria bite time take develop malaria long . If volunteer protect able try improve vaccine compare immune response volunteer protect protect . The information get study may help prevent malaria infection disease live endemic area traveller .
