	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Anti-Arrhythmic Medications After Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common heart rhythm disorder US associate shortness breath , palpitation , stroke occurrence increase mortality . Traditional treatment AF include anticoagulation , drug slow heart rate antiarrhythmic agent . More recently , catheter base treatment address atrial fibrillation develop , involve use radiofrequency energy isolate arrhythmogenic focus localize pulmonary vein . During first week follow pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) , unusual patient experience early recurrence atrial fibrillation atrial tachycardia due irritability ablation . While arrhythmias tend resolve time , nevertheless standard practice prescribe antiarrhythmic drug first 2-3 month intervention prevent early recurrence . However , efficacy practice never formally evaluate . In addition , identify small group patient whose atrial tachycardia terminate cessation antiarrhythmic therapy , suggest proarrhythmia agent may promote reentrant tachycardia patient . We therefore design study protocol evaluate usefulness short term antiarrhythmic drug therapy order prevent atrial fibrillation atrial tachycardia episode first 6 week follow PVI . The target population study include patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refer PVI . After ablation procedure , patient randomize receive receive antiarrhythmic drug period 6 week . Arrhythmia occurrence period monitor via twice daily transtelephonic monitoring . Clinical visit include physical exam 12 lead ECG record schedule 6 week . The primary endpoint study composite endpoint include 1 ) atrial arrhythmia persist &gt; 24 hour require initiation antiarrhythmic therapy 2 ) need cardioversion/hospital admission 3 ) need repeat ablation 4 ) adverse outcome/intolerance antiarrhythmic agent require drug cessation change 6 week follow period .</detailed_description>
