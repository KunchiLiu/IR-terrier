	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving chemotherapy bevacizumab surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving bevacizumab surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know chemotherapy regimen effective without bevacizumab treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study six different chemotherapy regimen compare well work without bevacizumab treat woman stage I , stage II , stage IIIA breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy docetaxel follow doxorubicin hydrocloride cyclophosphamide ( AC ) v docetaxel capecitabine follow AC v docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride follow AC , without bevacizumab , term increase rate pathologic complete response ( pCR ) breast , woman palpable operable breast cancer . Secondary - Compare docetaxel/capecitabine AC v docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride AC v docetaxel AC , without bevacizumab , term rate pCR breast post-therapy lymph node evaluate histologically ( pCR breast node ) . - Determine whether addition bevacizumab docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen ( docetaxel AC , docetaxel capecitabine AC , docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride AC ) increase rate pCR breast node compare docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen without bevacizumab patient . - Determine whether addition capecitabine gemcitabine hydrochloride docetaxel , without bevacizumab , increase rate clinical overall response ( cOR ) compare docetaxel alone without bevacizumab patient . - Determine whether addition bevacizumab docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen increase rate cOR compare docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen without bevacizumab patient . - Determine whether addition capecitabine gemcitabine hydrochloride docetaxel , without bevacizumab , increase rate clinical complete response ( cCR ) compare docetaxel alone without bevacizumab patient . - Determine whether addition bevacizumab docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen ( docetaxel AC , docetaxel/capecitabine AC , docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride AC ) increase rate cCR compare docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen without bevacizumab patient . - Identify gene expression profile predict pCR patient treat different sequential docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen without bevacizumab . - Identify gene expression profile predict cOR patient treat docetaxel alone , docetaxel/capecitabine , docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride without bevacizumab . - Determine accuracy vitro chemoresponse assay ( ChemoFx® ) predictor pCR patient treat different sequential docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen without bevacizumab . - Determine accuracy ChemoFx® predictor cOR patient treat docetaxel alone , docetaxel/capecitabine , docetaxel/gemcitabine hydrochloride without bevacizumab patient . - Determine impact preoperative bevacizumab sequential chemotherapy regimen postoperative bevacizumab therapy cardiac function patient . - Determine impact bevacizumab surgical complication patient . - Determine toxicity preoperative regimens toxicity postoperative bevacizumab patient . - Compare docetaxel/anthracycline-based regimen v without bevacizumab , term increase disease-free survival , patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor size ( 2-4 cm v &gt; 4 cm ) , nodal status ( negative v positive ) , hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] -positive and/or progesterone-receptor [ PgR ] -positive v ER- PgR-negative ) , age ( &lt; 50 year vs ≥ 50 year ) . Patients randomize 1 6 treatment arm . Core needle biopsy perform baseline . Tumor tissue sample also collect definitive surgery . Samples examine gene expression polymorphism reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis chemoresponse assay ( ChemoFx® ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,200 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must consent participate must sign dated appropriate Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve consent form conform federal institutional guideline study treatment submission preentry core biopsy material correlative study . Patients must female . Patients must 18 year age old . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . The diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast must make core needle biopsy . The primary breast tumor must palpable measure great equal 2.0 cm physical exam . All patient must leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) assess multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram within 3 month prior study entry . The LVEF must great equal low limit normal ( LLN ) cardiac image facility perform study . Note : If cardiac imaging facility provide LLN , use 50 % LLN value . Note : Since preentry LVEF serve baseline compare subsequent LVEF assessment determine bevacizumab therapy continue , critical baseline study accurate assessment patient 's LVEF . If baseline LVEF great 75 % , investigator study review accuracy prior study entry . Following study entry , LVEF determination may review time postchemotherapy ( preoperative ) evaluation . Please note accurate value obtain review baseline MUGA echocardiogram , correct value must submit NSABP postchemotherapy ( preoperative ) MUGA echocardiogram perform used manage postoperative bevacizumab . All patient must EKG within 3 month prior study entry . At time randomization : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great equal 1200/mm3 . Platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 .
