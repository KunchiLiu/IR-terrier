	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically and/ cytologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . 2 . Patients either sex , race ethnic group , &gt; 18 year age . 3 . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status ≤ 2 . 4 . Patients life expectancy least 4 month . 5 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin ≥10 gm/dL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mL platelet ≥ 100,000/mL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine within 1.5 time upper normal institutional limit 6 . The effect P27600 develop human foetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study duration study participation least 4 week withdrawal study . 7 . Women nurse include study 8 . Concomitant medication diabetes , hypertension , pain relief coexist condition , except cancer , permit patient study medication . There change dosage medication 2 week prior day 1 cycle 1 , exception dosage pain relief medication . Changes dose antiemetic diuretic may make provide interfere probable adverse effect investigational product . 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study ( date consent ) ; patient recover adverse event ( except grade 1 toxicity ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Patients receive investigational agent within 4 week prior date consent patient recover completely side effect earlier investigational agent . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition P27600 . 5 . Patients history myocardial infarction uncontrolled cardiac dysfunction previous 6 month . 6 . Patients diarrhea require antidiarrheal therapy . 7 . Patients coagulopathy require anticoagulation . 8 . Patients uncontrolled stable intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 9 . Women pregnant nursing . P27600 may potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Since unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother P27600 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated P27600 . 10 . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive patient exclude study . 11 . Patients require use concomitant medication prolong QT/QTc interval and/or know cause Torsades de Pointes ( TdP )</criteria>
