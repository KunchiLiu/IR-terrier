	<brief_summary>Background : The use thiazide diuretic treatment hypertension ( HT ) widely consider first line treatment , give efficacy low cost class drug . This indication unanimous , thiazide cause metabolic alteration side effect increase cardiac cerebrovascular risk , reduce compliance treatment increase health care system cost . However , large intervention trial HT suggest improvement cardiovascular prognosis HT patient depend follow-up procedure type drug use . Furthermore , investigator document improved compliance antihypertensive therapy implement cooperation general practitioner ( GPs ) HT specialist . Objectives : In multicenter , open label randomize study investigator compare persistence therapy thiazide versus treatment , first line antihypertensive therapy , clinical set characterized strict cooperation GPs HT specialist . The investigator also analyse candidate gene impact drug-induced metabolic alteration elucidate pathophysiology phenomenon . Methods : 260 GPs recruit 2600 hypertensive patient indication pharmacological treatment randomise start treatment chlortalidone ( 12.5 25 mg daily , 1300 pt ) GP decide single drug ( exclude thiazide ) combination therapy high tolerate dose . In group class antihypertensive drug add time order achieve blood pressure control ( &lt; 140/90 mmHg ) . Follow-up last 2 year . Blood sample urine analysis , carotid cardiac ultrasound perform baseline schedule time point . Genotyping perform sequence . Data collect stored use web base centralized Case Report Form ( CRF ) Expected result : Results highlight whether follow-up strategy base tight cooperation GPs HT specialist allow use thiazide first line antihypertensive therapy without negative effect persistence , adherence efficacy treatment . These data use reduce total burden Health Care System HT replace expensive drug diuretic 50 % hypertensive patient , receive class drug . Furthermore , pharmacogenetic approach may clarify pathophysiological mechanism drug-induced metabolic side effect</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacosurveillance Pharmacogenetics First-line Diuretics Hypertension : The StayOnDiur Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale Many comment issue similarity difference 2003 American European guideline management arterial hypertension ( 1,2 ) , especially publication Antihypertensive Lipid-Lowering Treatment Prevent Heart Attack Trial ( ALLHAT ) study ( 3-5 ) . Both guideline agree majority hypertensive patient require one medication achieve optimal blood pressure control , consistent recent finding , need expensive , large clinical trial demonstrate superiority one medication another probably ( 3,6 ) . What clear blood pressure must optimally control reduce risk cardiovascular mortality morbidity population , matter combination medication use . Comparison single medication substantially academic conceals reality : trial , circumstance comparison combination , single medication . In Losartan Intervention Endpoint Reduction Study ( LIFE study ) ( 6 ) , instance , comparison combination losartan low dose hydrochlorothiazide versus combination atenolol diuretic . The difference seventh Joint National Committee ( USA ) Prevention , Diagnosis Management Hypertension ( JNC VII ) European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) European Society Hypertension ( ESH ) 2003 guideline , often present substantial , priority Americans still give diuretic therapy , consistent wait result ALLHAT ( 3 ) . The ALLHAT randomize , double-blind , multicenter clinical institutional trial , entirely sponsor National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) ( 3 ) , design determine whether occurrence fatal nonfatal coronary heart disease lower high risk hypertensive patient treated amlodipine , lisinopril , doxazosin , chlorthalidone . The protocol also approve independent Review Committee external NHLBI ( 7 ) . The ALLHAT recruit 9,000-15,000 participants/intervention arm ( total : 33,357 ) , follow-up quite long ( 4-8 year ) . The doxazosin arm close prematurely high mortality ( 8 ) . Despite number important limitation study ( 4,9 ) , overall impact finding remain high . The baseline characteristic ALLHAT participants substantially similar 3 arm complete study . Chlortalidone significantly effective amlodipine lisinopril achieve optimal control blood pressure year 1 year 2 effective lisinopril blood pressure control year 3 , 4 5 ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Consistent good control blood pressure , chlortalidone tend provide 10 % protection combine fatal non fatal coronary heart disease lisinopril whereas protection similar amlodipine , though protection le evident superiority control blood pressure . In fact , difference risk profile versus lisinopril arm achieve statistical significance elderly African-American participant . Another relevant finding ALLHAT concern incidence congestive heart failure substantially less chlortalidone either amlodipine lisinopril . There many recurrent criticism trial show superiority diuretic medication control blood pressure . First , worsen glucose metabolism , due thiazide effect , matter concern ( 4,14-18 ) . Also ALLHAT author report high incidence diabetes diuretic group , however , affect outcome result ( 3 ) . However , concern also sustain recent evidence dangerous effect incident diabetes patient arterial hypertension ( 15 ) . One factor might aggravate glucose metabolism therapy diuretic underestimated effect hypokalemia , interfere glucose-stimulated insulin release , condition might aggravate association beta-adrenergic block ( 19,20 ) . Among beneficial effect , include improvement blood pressure control , correction hypokalemia prevents significantly reduce thiazide-induced hyperglycemia ( 21-24 ) . It possible low-dose potassium-sparing diuretic prevent hypokaleemia might also prevent metabolic effect thiazide , time enhance antihypertensive effect thiazide ( 25 ) , , hypothesis never test ad hoc trial . The second concern use diuretic risk low therapeutic compliance hypertensive patient , due diuretic effect hypokalemia-related side-effects ( 26,27 ) . These report , however , contrast evidence quality life improve long term therapy diuretic ( 28-30 ) . The effort , therefore , probably direct toward persistence initial treatment diuretic , goal might reach improve procedure follow-up , instance , recently propose , implement internet-based digital network , connect hypertension specialist general practitioner ( 31 ) . The Campania Salute ( CS ) network system set 1995 u ( 31 ) . It italian regional network system aim improve management essential hypertension integrate activity general practitioner ( GPs ) hypertension specialist . This network include 12.000 hypertensive patient follow 23 outpatient hypertensive clinic allocate different Community Hospitals Campania Region 60 GPs , homogeneously allocate regional area , refer Hypertension Clinic Federico II University Hospital Naples ( coordinate centre ) . GPs randomly select among pool physician refer patient Hypertension Clinic Federico II University . Through CS system clinical data detect visit share coordinate center peripheral units.Low-risk hypertensive patient continue follow peripheral unit , whereas high-risk hypertensive patient closely follow coordinate centre , also evaluate target organ damage associate disease . Patients ' information share on-line access remote database , integrate smartcards . The smartcard belong patient contain his/her personal identification number ( PIN ) . This PIN allow user access file patient store database . Each physician also PIN access database , limit his/her patient file . Clinical data upgrade visit GPs physicians peripheral centre coordinator centre . Access remote database allow user read clinical laboratory data , well track electrocardiography ( ECG ) cardiac vascular ultrasound image . In addition , smartcard also work portable database identification clinical data report . By virtue central database , data individual patient store , update retrieve directly on-line participant project . The restricted access individual data require pre-assigned identification code patient relevant remote unit . The central database use Wincare software ( TSD Projects , Milan , Italy ) contain separate sheet medical history , physical examination , biochemistry electrocardiography , cardiovascular ultrasound , image test ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . The last update individual patient 's record also download stored patient 's personal smartcard . We start CS project aim obtain strong interaction GPs hypertension clinic , provide direct link accessible patient ' record . Blood pressure control improve referral system , since good overall result obtain patient follow within network . Indeed , end observation period , 51 % patient CS group blood pressure 140/90 mmHg , percentage comparable patient include clinical trial . This follow-up strategy also allow active pharmacovigilance procedure , side effect promptly report GPs , prevent occurrence difference compliance among various antihypertensive treatment . In addition , kind follow-up allow mean pharmacogenetic study demonstrate occurrence side effect may predict individual genotype ( 32 ) . Indeed , recently report patient bear β2AR gene Glu27 variant β3AR gene Arg64 variant large occurrence hypertriglyceridemia , alone combination elevate cholesterol level . Furthermore , β2AR Glu27variant significantly associate hypetriglyceridemia cumulative fashion . The risk develop side effect β-blockade four-fold high patient homozygous β2AR Glu27 variant β2AR27Gln allele . This result allow identification patient high risk develop metabolic complication chronic β-blockade treatment , also contribute elucidate pathophysiological mechanism mediate side effect , raise possibility prevent . Objectives study This study design ass whether follow-up strategy base strict cooperation GPs hypertension specialist allow use diuretic first-line antihypertensive treatment persistence assign therapy equivalent achieve use first line antihypertensive therapy . Assessment safety efficacy control cardiovascular risk also perform secondary endpoint . In fact , contrast trial compare single-drug effect , study compare two strategy antihypertensive management , base either real-word prescription regimen thiazide diuretic represent force first line antihypertensive therapy . If hypothesis demonstrate diuretic might suggest efficient economic first line antihypertensive treatment , build optimal antihypertensive therapy add class drug , patient , provide follow-up procedure base propose organization . This approach great utility National Health Care System reduce cost , since , large part economic burden relate use antihypertensive medication expensive thiazide , first line agent , particular far 40 % hypertensive patient receive diuretic therapy . Finally , pharmacogenetic study focus characterization polymorphism candidate gene associate development metabolic side effect diuretic , help understand mechanism underlie adverse event . This kind information help prevent occurrence adverse event use adeguate combination treatment , thus result reduction cost antihypertensive treatment due reduction number patient discontinue therapy occurrence adverse event . Study design This multicenter , open label , randomize study compare effect antihypertensive strategy use thiazide diuretic first-line , versus use initial therapy antihypertensive treatment .
