	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give imatinib mesylate together paclitaxel work treat old patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving imatinib mesylate together paclitaxel may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Paclitaxel Treating Older Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical efficacy combination weekly paclitaxel intermittent imatinib elderly patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile combination weekly paclitaxel intermittent imatinib elderly patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . II . To collect paraffin tissue block companion project evaluate expression platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) original tumor specimen , relationship response rate survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 3 , 10 , 17 imatinib mesylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-4 , 8-11 , 15-18 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4-6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
