	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open label observational study conduct 26 week . Approximately 2,500 high-risk patient elevate LDL-C level ( &gt; 2.5 mmol/L ) enrol . Patients meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion Visit 1 ( Screening ) include study . Eligible patient agree participate sign inform consent treat either statin therapy ( increase start switch ) combination statin ezetimibe 10 mg ( added/started ) per Study Schematic ( Table 1 ) order achieve recommend target LDL &lt; 2.5 mmol/L provide treatment best interest patient . After enrollment total three schedule clinic visit . All patient vital sign measure well brief physical examination perform Visit 1 ( Screening ) . At Visit 2 ( 6 week ) patient LDL-C &gt; 2.5mmol/L treat either statin therapy increase combination statin ezetimibe 10 mg ( added/started ) per Study Schematic ( Table 1 ) order achieve recommend target LDL &lt; 2.5 mmol/L provide treatment best interest patient . At Visit 3 ( 12 -18 week ) patient LDL &gt; 2.5 mmol/L treat combination statin ezetimibe 10 mg per Study Schematic ( Table 1 ) order achieve recommend target LDL &lt; 2.5 mmol/L provide treatment best interest patient .

	<detailed_description>Overview This Quality Enhancement Research Initiative ( QERI ) whereby physician provide guideline easy follow step achievement.. Approximately 2,500 high-risk patient elevate LDL-C level ( &gt; 2.5 mmol/L ) enrol . Patients meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion Visit 1 ( Screening ) include . Eligible patient agree participate sign inform consent treat appropriate treatment optimization include use ezetimibe achieve Study Schematics ( Table 1 ) . After enrollment total three schedule clinic visit . Physicians may assess patient visit 2 3 maximization statin therapy require . At Visit 2 ( 6 week ) patient LDL &gt; 2.5mmol/L treat either statin therapy ( increase start switch ) combination statin ezetimibe 10 mg ( added/started ) per Study Schematic ( Table 1 ) order achieve recommend target LDL &lt; 2.5 mmol/L provide treatment best interest patient . At Visit 3 ( 12-18 week ) patient LDL &gt; 2.5 mmol/L treat combination statin ezetimibe 10 mg ( added/started ) per Study Schematic ( Table 1 ) order achieve recommend target LDL &lt; 2.5 mmol/L provide treatment best interest patient . At final Visit 4 ( 24-26 week ) safety efficacy treatment review . Following Visit 4 physician continue treat patient accord clinical judgment . 1.5.1 Treatment During observational study patient treat standard care either statin therapy and/or co-administered ezetimibe 10 mg /day . This open label observational study , therefore patient physician aware treatment allocation treatment choose best interest patient accord physician 's preference . Treatment begin Visit 1- Screening/Baseline ( Day 0 ) extend Visit 4 ( Week 24-26 ) . Based patient 's LDL-C level , visit 1 ( Screening/Baseline ) patient receive prescription initial increase dose statin 10-80 mg/day and/or ezetimibe 10 mg/day follow 6 week . At visit 2 ( 6 week F/U ) patient receive prescription statin ( dose increase ) and/or ezetimibe 10 mg per day follow 6 week base target level LDL-C. At visit 3 ( week 12 -18 F/U ) patient reach LDL-C target , ezetimibe 10 mg per day consider appropriate patient follow 14 week complete observational study .</detailed_description>
