	<brief_title>Tandutinib Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall efficacy MLN518 patient metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect MLN518 progression-free survival overall survival patient metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma . II . To evaluate toxicity MLN518 patient metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma . III . To evaluate effect MLN518 serum VEGF-A , VEGF-R2 , PIGF , PDGF level patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma receive MLN518 . IV . To determine VHL gene status , methylation , pVHL archive material primary nephrectomy specimen patient receive MLN518 . V. To evaluate tumor blood flow vessel permeability base functional image dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( dceMRI ) metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient treat MLN518 . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients receive oral tandutinib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
