	<brief_summary>An abdominal distribution fat associate great heart disease risk , commonly , several risk factor metabolic origin cluster individual . When occur condition call 'metabolic syndrome ' . Increased activity sympathetic nervous system result enhanced release stress hormone 'noradrenaline ' , may one mechanism adverse cardiovascular metabolic sequela metabolic syndrome might mediate . Impaired insulin action may one factor contribute increase noradrenaline release . The aim Study determine whether treatment drug call pioglitazone know improve insulin action , result reduce sympathetic nervous system activity stress hormone release compare treatment dummy drug ( placebo ) .</brief_summary>
