	<brief_summary>Zinc deficiency find widespread among child develop countries.Clinical field study consistently observe association zinc deficiency high rate infectious disease , include skin infection , diarrhea , respiratory infection , malaria , delay wound heal . Based upon impact zinc deficiency diarrheal disease alone , estimate correction deficiency could save 450,000 under-five death annually . What physiological explanation ? Zinc identify play critical role metallo-enzymes , poly-ribosomes , cell membrane , cellular function , lead understand also play central role cellular growth function immune system . With zinc deficiency epithelial barrier compromise multiple component immune system malfunction . The obvious conclusion zinc deficiency result diminish immunological competence turn lead increase risk infectious disease great severity illness . Whether case require substantiation . A related , pragmatic question value add zinc supplementation addition zinc treatment . The scale-up strategy pursue Bangladesh provide zinc 10 day treatment time diarrhea episode . This accordance recently revise WHO recommendations treatment childhood diarrhea ( WHO , press ) . Can conclude minimal value add continue zinc dietary supplement zinc deficient child follow acute episode ? If add benefit , explain improvement zinc level and/or immune function ? The aim study include:1 . In child six twenty-four month age acute episode diarrhea attributable enterotoxigenic E. coli ( ETEC ) , describe innate adaptive immune response zinc relate change immune function zinc status occurrence repeat infectious illness 9 month period observation . 2a . In child six twenty-four month age acute episode diarrhea enterotoxigenic E. coli ( ETEC ) , non-ETEC diarrhea , determine value add zinc supplementation follow treatment term future occurrence ACD , ARI , impetigo 2b . assess impact zinc supplementation health service utilization household expenditures ACD , ARI impetigo .</brief_summary>
