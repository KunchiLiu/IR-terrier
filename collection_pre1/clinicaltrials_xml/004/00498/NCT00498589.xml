	<brief_title>Comparison Methotrexate v Placebo Corticosteroid-dependent Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory bowel disease slightly reduce life expectancy , strongly reduce quality lead serious complication acute colitis , dysplasia colon cancer . About 40'000 patient affected France Among , 15 % suffer chronic active form often lead extended steroid therapy , know side effect . Azathioprine already proven efficacy indication bring last remission without steroid 41 % patient ( 1-4 ) . What medication available patient fail maintain remission azathioprine ? Cyclosporin design severe steroid-resistant form . ( 5 ) . The result two recent study show infliximab efficacious placebo active UC ( 6 , 7 ) . Infliximab expensive , efficacy steroid-dependent UC specifically test yet , tolerance long term remain uncertain . Methotrexate prove efficacy Crohn 's disease intramuscular dose 25mg/week ( 8 ) . In UC control trial negative oral dose 12.5mg/week ( 9 ) . Another study compare mercaptopurine , methotrexate ( 15mg/week ) 5-aminosalicylate 72 steroid-dependent patient CD UC ( 10 ) . The remission rate obtain 58 % 30 week methotrexate ( significantly different 5-ASA ) 14 % 106 week ( significantly different 5-ASA ) . Few data available efficacy methotrexate UC , dose active Crohn 's disease ( 25mg intramuscular/week ) . Several uncontrolled series publish , include 91 patient whose remission fail azathioprine . Methotrexate cheap patent fall public domain . Only institutional research able finance study new indication . This prospective , control , randomize , double-blind study methotrexate intramuscular dose 25mg/week v placebo patient steroid-dependent UC . This multicenter study take place aegis Therapeutic Study Group Inflammatory Digestive Diseases ( G.E.T.A.I.D . ) help gastroenterologist network CIC . The issue study important . If hypothesis borne , cheap , efficacious medication available chronic active UC .</detailed_description>
