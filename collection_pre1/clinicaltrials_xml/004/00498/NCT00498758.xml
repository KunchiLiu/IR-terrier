	<brief_title>The APOS System : Effects Gait , Mobility QOL Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , biomechanical wedge system develop gait balance training among patient suffer gait disorder . The APOS system ( APOS Medical &amp; Sports Technologies Ltd , Hertzeliya , Israel ) apply special semispherical shoe , individually adjust implant , improve age- disease-related loss muscle strength neuromuscular control . The semispherical rubber device place sol shoe hind-foot mid-foot move medially , laterally , forward backwards . The system individually adjust order optimally balance load re-train postural control gait . An additional advantage treatment approach extraordinary compliance . The system easily adjust , maintain , allow safe gait training . After randomization , subject fit APOS system , These shoe alter dynamic balance gait cycle phase , adjust center gravity train postural control . The precise location two wedge adjust individually expert trainer use standardized protocol . Subjects intervention group receive proper wedge ; subject sham group receive almost flat wedge lack proper biomechanical characteristic . However , shoe wedge look similar . All subject instruct start gradually , goal reach 30 minute in-home walk wear special training shoe . As extra pre-caution , subject ask walk shoe presence caregiver , spouse family member first month . Before move independent training , subject check safety .</detailed_description>
