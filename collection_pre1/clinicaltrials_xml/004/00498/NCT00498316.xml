	<detailed_description>Umbilical cord blood source blood-forming cell use transplantation . The major problem type transplant small number blood-forming cell available cord unit , may delay `` take '' graft recipient . A strategy overcome problem give 2 cord blood unit , increase number cord blood cell one laboratory transplant . This do order increase number . The expansion 1 , , cord blood unit allow research team decide effectively whether laboratory expansion responsible speed content `` take . '' At time , proof exist expansion technique improve performance cord blood specimen . In order collect large expansion number cord blood cell , recent research suggest grow cord blood cell layer bone marrow stromal cell increase number expand cell collect . In body , stromal cell form matrix `` spider web '' bone marrow . Blood-forming bone marrow cell ( look like dewdrop ) grow stromal cell matrix ( spider web ) nurture stromal cell . In research study , researcher either collect marrow stromal cell family member bone marrow aspiration , use `` off-the-shelf '' marrow stromal cell collect healthy donor . These `` off-the-shelf '' marrow stromal cell grow frozen Mesoblast Systems . These stromal cell either family member `` off-the-shelf '' hopefully improve performance cord blood cell give . Placement central venous catheter collection `` back-up '' peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPC ) : Before back-up PBPC collect receive chemotherapy , require placement hollow plastic tube ( catheter ) large vein inside body . This catheter use draw blood give medication fluid . The catheter insert skin upper chest extends point right side heart . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Collection back-up stem cell : Because collect additional cell donor cord blood possible transplant cord blood fails , back-up PBPC bone marrow sample ensure recovery marrow function collect frozen high dose chemotherapy begin . This specimen use doctor think necessary . Peripheral blood progenitor cell collection ( Leukapheresis ) : Before collection PBPC , treat drug call granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) , cause important stem cell marrow move peripheral blood collect . This medication give shot skin day 3-7 day , time PBPC collect central catheter 3-4 hour outpatient procedure . This procedure standard , call leukapheresis . You require sign separate consent form procedure . Bone Marrow Collection : If leukapheresis perform successfully , receive general anesthesia operating room multiple needle stick hip bone order collect bone marrow . Less 5 percent bone marrow take . This procedure , do , also require sign separate consent form . Selection alternate back-up donor : If back-up bone marrow back-up PBPC collect , family member ask serve back-up donor identify third cord blood unit may use cord blood unit fail function . A back-up donor product require participate research Selection stromal cell donor cord culture : In study , researcher identify donor stromal cell . This either family member unrelated healthy donor whose marrow stromal cell collect , grow , frozen Mesoblast Systems ( off-the-shelf ) . If family member use , collect 7 tablespoon bone marrow them.This family member 's tissue type ( HLA antigens ) exactly match . That bone marrow take laboratory 3-4 week , marrow stromal cell grow . These marrow stromal cell produce vitamin-like growth factor may help cord blood cell expand great number . If family member appropriately HLA match , meet eligibility , candidate due health reason , participant 's disease get bad enough time grow family member 's marrow cell marrow stromal cell , `` off-the-shelf '' marrow stromal cell collect healthy donor use procedure . These `` off-the-shelf '' marrow stromal cell grow frozen Mesoblast Systems . These cell safely give patient peripheral vascular disease , use study consider investigational . Your bone marrow transplant doctor assign one 3 chemotherapy treatment , discuss . High-dose chemotherapy treatment ( Myeloablative ) : If 1 55 year age receive high-dose chemotherapy , 55 65 year old doctor agree , receive fludarabine , clofarabine , busulfan , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , total body irradiation . You receive test dose busulfan vein 60 minute outpatient usually week admission . If test dose give outpatient , admitted hospital Day -9 IV fluid busulfan test dose . This low-level `` test '' dose busulfan check level busulfan blood level change time . This information use decide next dose need reach target blood level match body size . About 11 sample blood draw pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test busulfan . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . These blood sample draw various timepoints start Busulfan infusion continue approximately next 11 hour . The blood sample repeat first day high-dose busulfan treatment . Each sample 1 teaspoon blood . A temporary heparin lock place vein low number needle stick need draws . If possible PK test perform technical scheduling reason , receive standard fix dose busulfan . If receive test dose outpatient , admitted hospital Day -8 receive fluid vein . On Days -7 -4 , receive vein fludarabine 1 hour , clofarabine vein 1 hour , busulfan vein 3 hour . You receive ATG Days -4 -3 . On Day -3 , receive single treatment low-dose total body irradiation . You `` rest '' ( receive chemotherapy drug ) Days -2 -1 . Day 0 day transplantation , negative day number use label treatment day transplant . All chemotherapy drug , fluid , medication must give vein infuse catheter . Once back-up cell collect , participant admit hospital indicate assign treatment plan schedule . Chemotherapy may stop intolerable side effect occur . Lower-dose chemotherapy treatment ( Non-myeloablative ) : If old 55 80 year age less , age pre-existing medical condition prevents receive high dose chemotherapy , receive fludarabine- cyclophosphamide-ATG-total body irradiation . You receive cyclophosphamide single dose Day -6 . Fludarabine give day 4 day row ( Days -6 -3 ) . You receive ATG Days -4 -3 . You also receive single treatment low-dose total body irradiation Day -1 . Day 0 day transplantation . Rituximab may give Day -9 appropriate disease . All chemotherapy drug , fluid , medication must give vein infuse catheter . Once back-up cell collect , participant admit hospital indicate assign treatment plan schedule . Chemotherapy may stop intolerable side effect occur . Reduced Intensity chemotherapy treatment : If age 1 80 year old ( study doctor think would keep receive full myeloablative therapy ) , receive low-dose total body irradiation , doctor agrees , receive fludarabine-melphalan-ATG . Starting Day -5 receive fludarabine give day 4 day row ( Days -5 -2 ) . You receive Melphalan single dose Day -2 . You receive ATG Days -3 -2 . Day 0 day transplantation . All chemotherapy drug , fluid , medication must give vein infuse catheter . Once back-up cell collect , participant admit hospital indicate assign treatment plan schedule . Chemotherapy may stop intolerable side effect occur . Expansion cord blood : On Day -14 , one two cord blood unit thaw MD Anderson Stem Cell Laboratory expand layer marrow stromal cell family member `` off-the-shelf '' marrow stromal cell . The expansion continue 2 week complete , cell give Day 0 described . A small amount cord blood cell ( less 3 % ) use laboratory procedure measure quality product . The CliniMACS System medical device use separate type blood cell blood remove body leukapheresis . These separated cell process use treatment stem cell transplant . Transplantation cord blood : Two ( 2 ) day completion high lower-dose therapy ( Day 0 ) , unit cord blood ( expand unexpanded cord ) infuse ( one time ) catheter . The unexpanded cord thaw infuse first , follow infusion cell expand lab . Each unit take 30 minute infuse . You hospitalize marrow function restore enough . This usually take 3-6 week . During time , receive variety medication , transfusion , standard procedure aim decrease risk procedure , graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) . Graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) preventive therapy : GVHD result reaction transplant cord blood cell certain tissue body . In attempt prevent decrease severity GVHD , receive 2 drug . Mycophenolate give catheter 2 time per day ( morning evening ) Days -3 Day 100 . Tacrolimus give 24-hour continuous infusion 3-6 week . Around Day 30 40 ( engraftment ) , tacrolimus change pill give day 180 day ( 6 month ) . If GVHD present , tacrolimus may continue long . The number tacrolimus pill may vary accord blood level drug , usually 1-5 pill . Your dose tacrolimus gradually lower around Day 180 GVHD present . This medicine use 6-9 month ( long chronic GVHD occur ) . You remain study long disease return . If disease return , take study may offer participation another study standard treatment . Follow-up transplant : After leave hospital , see regularly Department Blood Marrow Transplantation MD Anderson . The frequency visit may vary , may often daily . Routine blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine test perform . The frequency blood test may also vary , may perform daily . You bone marrow sample collect transplant need first 100 day transplant , every 3 month first year transplant , year study . After , bone marrow sample collect year , indefinitely . These sample collect look tumor ( stag test ) looFk chimerism ( percent tumor cell detectable predict graft failure and/or relapse ) . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Participants lymphomas Hodgkin 's disease need compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen , pelvis perform transplant , need first 100 day transplant , every 3 month first year transplant . After , scan do yearly . You study 1 year follow yearly standard care . This investigational study . All treatment drug give FDA approve commercially available . The CliniMACS device FDA approve . At time , use research . Up 125 patient may take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
