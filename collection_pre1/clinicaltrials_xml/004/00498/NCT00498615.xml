	<brief_summary>Raynaud 's phenomenon think occur , response cold emotional stress , closure digital artery cutaneous arteriole lead clinical finding sharp demarcated digital pallor cyanosis distal skin finger and/or toe . Patients often continue experience problem despite current available treatment . The investigator ' study investigate use new vasodilator call Fasudil , Rho-kinase inhibitor . The investigator ' hypothesis Fasudil prevent vasoconstriction digital cutaneous artery standard laboratory base cold exposure therefore improve digital blood flow skin temperature recovery time follow cold challenge . These data provide rationale elaborate clinical trial real life situation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) reversible vasospastic disorder digital artery cutaneous arteriole characterize typical skin color change tissue ischemia ( 1 ) . Avoidance common trigger cold temperature emotional stress often lead improvement symptom . When strategy yield inadequate benefit , pharmacologic therapy need . Cutaneous vasoconstriction occur general sympathetic adrenergic response local mechanism response cold . While normal condition , vasomotor tone regulate mainly a.2A- adrenoreceptors ( a.2A-AR ) express vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) ( 2 ) ; cold exposure normally `` silent '' a.2C-AR relocate Golgi complex cell surface , drive cold-induced vasoconstrictive response ( 3 ) . Interestingly , reactivity a.2-AR stimulation highly increase cutaneous artery patient systemic sclerosis ( SSc ; scleroderma ) ( 4 ) , block- age a.2C-AR show shorten time recover digital skin temperature cold challenge patient Raynaud 's Phenomenon secondary Scleroderma ( 5 ) . The RhoA/Rho kinase pathway activated cool mediates vasoconstriction cutaneous artery induce a.2C-AR relocation cell surface increase calcium-dependent Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells ( VSMC ) contractility ( 6 ) . Rho kinase inhibition show effectively reduce a.2-AR-mediated response cold exposure prevent cold-induced vasoconstriction human skin ( 6 ) Therefore , RhoA/Rho kinase inhibition may provide highly selective intervention direct toward mechanism underlie thermosensitive vasomotor response skin Raynaud 's Phenomenon patient .</detailed_description>
