	<brief_summary>Primary outcome : Serum creatinine change 4 hour 48 hour follow 4 dos N-acetylcysteine ( total 4800 mg ) compare baseline serum creatinine . Secondary outcome : Serum Cystatin C change 4 hour 48 hour post 4 dos N-acetylcysteine compare baseline serum Cystatin C .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Administration N-Acetylcysteine Serum Creatinine Levels Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>N-acetylcysteine report low serum creatinine normal individual . The mechanism effect unknown possible stimulation tubular secretion creatinine hypothesize base upon lack effect Cystatin C level . If effect also occur subject chronic kidney disease , interpretation clinical trial use N-acetylcysteine prophylaxis acute kidney injury would confound . To answer whether confound occurs , 50 patient stable chronic kidney disease ( Stage 3-5 ) give 4 dos N-acetylcysteine , 1200 mg , measurement serum creatinine Cystatin C , 4 hour 48 hour last dose . No intervention , include change medication , permit study .</detailed_description>
