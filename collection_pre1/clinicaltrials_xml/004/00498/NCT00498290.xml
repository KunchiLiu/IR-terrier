	<brief_title>The Protocol Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The key factor keep patient hospital uncomplicated major colorectal surgery include need parenteral analgesia ( persistent pain ) , intravenous fluid ( persistent gut dysfunction ) , bed rest ( persistent lack mobility ) . These factor often overlap interact delay return function . Obviously , postoperative complication also prolong time recovery ultimately length stay . A clinical pathway , call Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) , accelerate recovery colonic resection base multimodal programme optimal pain relief , stress reduction regional anaesthesia , early enteral nutrition early mobilisation demonstrate improvement physical performance , pulmonary function , body composition mark reduction length stay . Comparison ( ) : A total 500 case colorectal surgery randomize receive ERAS protocol traditional protocol , mechanical bowl preparation , intravenous fluid bowl movement recovery bed rest .</detailed_description>
