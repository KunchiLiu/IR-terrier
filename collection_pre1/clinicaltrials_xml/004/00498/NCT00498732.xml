	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1 . To verify differentially express gene pathway normal OSA patient , OSA patient CPAP treatment . Genes change expression two-fold normal OSA patient well OSA patient CPAP treatment think confirm select validation study . 2 . To correlate confirm gene clinical presentation CPAP effect another 50 OSAS subject validate alter gene expression pathway involve . To investigate correlation gene confirm RT-PCR ( identify gene ) , another 50 OSAS subject include study . We analyze correlation identify gene clinical manifestation CPAP effect 50 OSAS patient . 3 . To establish cell model investigate differentially express gene putative biological pathway involve OSA syndrome . To investigate function gene identify first second year ( gene interest ) , establish cell model human monocyte cell line U937 . We investigate function gene interest overexpress knockdown . Objectives The objective project confirm gene profile compare normal OSA patient well OSA patient CPAP treatment , investigate correlation alter gene expression clinical presentation CPAP effect OSAS identify confirm correspond pathway . This study enhance understand individual constitution widely different clinical characteristic therapeutic variation . All effort also help u interpret molecular mechanism develop prediction diagnosis strategy OSAS . The long-term objective develop therapeutic strategy CPAP OSAS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) characterize recurrent collapse upper airway sleep result hypoxia sleep fragmentation , result cardiovascular disease , metabolic disorder neurocognitive dysfunction . The cardiovascular complication attribute OSAS include hypertension , coronary artery disease , heart failure stroke . The mechanism responsible development cardiovascular sequela include repeat episode hypoxia hypercapnia , exaggerate negative intrathoracic pressure burst sympathetic activity provoke surge blood pressure heart rate . Increase inflammatory mediator , include C-reactive protein , oxidative stress , adhesion molecule , vascular endothelial growth factor proinflammatory cytokine , think involve development cardiovascular disease patient OSAS . To clarify exact mechanism OSAS linkage cardiovascular complication , previous study , use oligo microarray genome-wide profile gene expression pattern OSAS patient change gene expression four-week CPAP treatment . The oligo-microarray data process CRSD database two-way hierarchical cluster method . The result show gene expression pattern different control subject OSA patient CPAP treatment also alter gene expression pattern . Totally 27 gene four pathway identify target gene pathway compare gene pattern change CPAP treatment , include apoptosis , oxidative phosphorylation , cell adhesion activation metabolism . To continue analyze gene pattern change CPAP treatment , propose three-year project achieve follow goal : ( 1 ) To verify differentially express gene pathway normal OSA patient , OSA patient CPAP treatment . ( 2 ) To correlate confirm gene clinical presentation CPAP effect another 50 OSAS subject validate alter gene expression pathway involve . ( 3 ) To establish cell model investigate differentially express gene putative biological pathway involve OSA syndrome . The information obtain approach useful understand pathogenic mechanism OSA lead systemic complication therapeutic intervention may therefore possible .</detailed_description>
