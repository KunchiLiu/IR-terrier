	<brief_summary>The purpose study find new investigational hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) vaccine , HEPLISAV™ , safe effective end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient . Two dose level study : single dose double dose . We expect dose level safely immunize patient HBV . The study determine dose best .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Single Double Dose HEPLISAV™ Hepatitis B Vaccine Adults With End-Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) major global health problem . Worldwide , estimate 2 billion people infect previously 350 million chronically infect . While acute HBV infection associate significant illness , risk chronic infection great importance since 5-10 % infected adult clear infection initial phase illness . About 25 % people initially clear infection later develop chronic active hepatitis . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity HEPLISAV™ administer adult end-stage renal disease ( glomerular filtration rate [ GFR ] ≤ 45 mL/min ) . Once subject consent , screen , randomize treatment , subject receive total three injection 24-week period , follow-up visit 28 50 week . Subjects receive 1 follow 2 regimen : - HEPLISAV™ single dose Day 0 , 4 week ( 1 month ) 24 week ( 6 month ) - HEPLISAV™ double dose Day 0 , 4 week ( 1 month ) 24 week ( 6 month ) Safety tolerability evaluate occurrence adverse event , periodic laboratory test , vital sign , local systemic reactogenicity . Immunogenicity evaluate proportion subject exhibit seroprotective immune response ( anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody [ anti-HBsAg ] ≥ 10 milli-international unit ( mIU ) /mL ) Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 28 50 .</detailed_description>
