	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common disease , occur 4 % middle-aged men 2 % middle-aged woman . The characteristic OSA recurrent collapse upper airway sleep , result intermittent hypoxia sympathetic activation . Cardiovascular complication associate OSA include artherosclerosis , hypertension , coronary artery disease congestive heart failure . Several inflammatory mediator include C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , oxidative stress , adhesion molecule , vascular endothelial growth factor proinflammatory cytokine , find elevate OSA , attribute development cardiovascular disease OSA . Our data show serum level TNF high OSA patient control subject . And serum level TNF inversely correlate low pulse oxygen saturation . After one-month CPAP treatment , serum TNF could significantly go . This finding suggest TNF good biomarker study OSA associate cardiovascular complication . The presentation sympathetic hyperactivity OSA include hypercatecholaminemia elevate sympathetic tone peripheral nerve . Hypercatecholaminemia known attribute development cardiovascular disease . Our data show plasma level epinephrine norepinephrine high OSA patient control subject . And elevated catecholamine could go one-month CPAP treatment . Meanwhile , data also show plasma level catecholamine highly correlate serum level TNF . In vivo study show epinephrine norepinephrine could potentiate LPS-induced expression TNF 2 adrenergic receptor . However , effect catecholamine TNF production human monocytes hypoxic microenvironment never study . Our preliminary data show epinephrine effect TNF expression human monocyte cell line U937 normoxic condition could attenuate TNF expression hypoxic condition . Therefore , hypothesize catecholamine modulate intermittent hypoxia induce TNF affect development cardiovascular complication OSA . In project , ’ use peripheral blood monocyte healthy subject OSA patient target cell , serially treat catecholamine  b antagonist normoxic hypoxic microenvironments , achieve follow 3 objective : 1. . To examine effect catecholamine modulation intermittent hypoxia induce TNF- human monocytes healthy subject OSA patient 2. . To map signal pathway catecholamine regulate intermittent hypoxia induce TNF- expression . 3. . To explore potential therapeutic effect   agonists/antagonists intermittent hypoxia induce TNF- expression</detailed_description>
