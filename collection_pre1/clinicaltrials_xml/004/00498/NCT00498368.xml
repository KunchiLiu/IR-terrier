	<brief_summary>This study IgA nephropathy , form kidney disease characterize presence blood protein urine . This study do determine medication rituximab could reduce protein patient 's urine . Hypothesis : In patient progressive IgA nephropathy intravenous infusion 1000 mg rituximab Day 1 Day 15 Days 168 182 superior conventional therapy reduce 24 hour proteinuria , slow progression chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Progressive Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent clinical success use Rituximab treatment Lupus nephritis form immune complex glomerulonephritis lead investigation treatment IgA nephropathy . Because IgA class antibody comparatively short half-lives deposition polymeric form IgA contribute glomerular injury , researcher speculate reduction circulate IgA could reduce proteinuria injury patient IgA nephropathy . Treatment Follow-up : Subjects randomly assign receive rituximab continue standard care . Both arm receive Omega-3 Fatty Acid Fish Oil Supplement angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor and/or Angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARBs ) . ACE inhibitor and/or ARBs use achieve blood pressure goal &lt; 130/80 mmHg . The study open-label trial ; assign rituximab receive 1 g infusion rituximab follow identical dose 2 week later . Premedication corticosteroid ( 10 mg dexamethasone intravenously ) also give 30 min prior first infusion series rituximab . They receive identical 2 g course rituximab 6 month later . Subjects assess least every 3 month need clinical event . This assessment include physical examination , questionnaire adverse event , measurement routine hematology , serum chemistry , time urine protein excretion , assign rituximab , B-cell subset . Follow-up consider complete 12 month .</detailed_description>
