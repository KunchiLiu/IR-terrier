	<detailed_description>The number people infect HIV-1 worldwide continue increase . However , antiretroviral therapy largely unavailable low- middle- income country risk infection high . The development safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection urgently need . This study evaluate effectiveness , safety , immunogenicity experimental multiclade HIV vaccine , VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP , follow adenovirus-vectored vaccine boost , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , HIV uninfected adult . Both vaccine code proteins HIV subtypes A , B , C , together represent 75 % 85 % new HIV infection world . Adenoviral type 5-based vaccine improve induction HIV-specific CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cell response , correlate low HIV burden ( viral load ) slow disease progression primates HIV-1 infected people whose disease progress long term . The purpose study determine safety effectiveness immune response series multiclade DNA vaccine injection follow booster injection multiclade adenovirus vaccine HIV-1 infection healthy adult risk HIV infection North South America , Caribbean , Africa . This study last 3 year 5 year , length study depend quickly people enroll quickly study new HIV-1 infection occur . Study participant randomly assign receive total three injection DNA vaccine VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP follow one injection adenovirus vaccine VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , total four injection vaccine four injection placebo . Injections occur study entry Weeks 4 , 8 , 24 . Prior study injection , participant vital sign weight measure , blood collection occur . Participants observe clinic least 30 minute injection immediate reaction vaccine . At injection visit , HIV risk-reduction counseling , HIV risk assessment , pregnancy prevention counseling , train use memory card also occur . For 3 7 day injection , participant ask record information injection site pain , redness , size , swell , temperature , general well-being , headaches memory card . Additional study visit occur Weeks 1 , 12 , 28 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 , 144 . At visit , physical examination , blood collection , social impact questionnaire may also do . Any study participant become infected HIV study monitor least 72 week diagnosis least 12 week study reach primary evaluation time point ( whichever long ) . The study investigator commit provide access local standard care treatment study participant find HIV-1 infect .</detailed_description>
