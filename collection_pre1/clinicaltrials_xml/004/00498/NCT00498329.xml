	<brief_summary>This study examine area brain connect control two finger movement time . It look people use see help guide two different movement . This ability , important everyday life , problem patient neurological problem . Healthy right-handed volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . The subject lie table slide scanner , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan . Participants undergo functional MRI ( fMRI ) . This standard MRI do subject performs skilled finger task response instruction see screen . Researchers localize brain area show activity change task perform . Before test session begin , subject complete questionnaire opportunity practice task . Subjects control position one two cursor screen use one two finger . They perform track point task accord see screen . During single-task experiment one task present screen . During dual-task experiment , two task present screen . Subjects perform either single-task dual-task experiment , . The fMRI last 90 minute , subject ask lie still scan 9 minute time . After complete fMRI , subject schedule research electroencephalogram ( EEG ) magnetoencephalogram ( MEG ) . The test do subject performs task researcher learn time change activity certain brain region performance task do fMRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Using block design BOLD-fMRI , want investigate connectivity brain region two motor response perform time . The design replicate use EEG MEG understand time course activate brain network well . It allow u map brain process involve sensorimotor integration attentional sharing . Study Population 160 individual subdivide : - 110 adult healthy volunteer - 25 patient Parkinson Disease - 25 patient Focal Hand Dystonia Design Two experiment perform use MEG , EEG fMRI technique . Both experiment use visuo-motor control task . Two motor response ( give two finger dominant hand ) simultaneously perform . Experiment 1 use single motor task ; Experiment 2 use dual motor task . In experiment , attention demand vary execution mode motor output ( competitive cooperative ) . In competitive task , visual stimulus use perform two independent motor output . In cooperative task , visual stimulus use perform two couple motor output . The effect execution mode brain connectivity isolate compare competitive cooperative task . The sensory information must associate motor command perform give motor task : process call sensorimotor integration . With experiment , able dissociate network connectivity link : - sensorimotor integration demand focus attention single task , - sensorimotor integration demand divide attention dual motor task . After subject properly train perform task , undergo fMRI scan MEG EEG record . Subjects perform task present pseudo-randomly six set 5-minute session . We record muscular activity via EMG surface electrode . Outcome Measures The primary outcome task-dependent functional connectivity ( fMRI ) area coherence ( MEG EEG ) cerebral source relative performance task . The force control two finger time would elicit blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signal electrical brain activity variation network involve manual dexterity . We interested study connectivity homologous motor area two hemisphere , prefrontal cortex parietal cortex , understand sensorimotor integration process competitive cooperative dual task . As second measure , interested analyze coherence MEG-EMG EEG-EMG signal .</detailed_description>
