	<brief_title>The Natural History Alpha-Mannosidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Definition : Human alpha-mannosidosis rare genetic disorder , cause lack lysosomal alpha-mannosidase , result mental retardation , skeletal change , hear loss recurrent infection . The lack alpha-mannosidase cause disorder glycoprotein catabolism associate abnormal level excretion small mannose-rich oligosaccharide . Prevalence : Alpha-mannosidosis belongs group lysosomal storage disorder include 50 different disease , cumulative frequency 1:10.000 world wide . The incidence alpha-mannosidase disease estimate 1 500.000 ( Australian Norwegian study ) . The disease specific ethnic group . Etiology Pathogenesis : Lysosomal alpha-mannosidase ( LAMAN ) , follow call mannosidase , enzyme cleaves alpha-mannosidic linkage order degradation oligosaccharide . Only degradation , sugar leave lysosome , cell later body . The deficiency mannosidase activity cause block degradation glycoprotein result lysosomal accumulation mannose-rich oligosaccharide chain . Consequently , sugar accumulate lysosome large leave . Finally , lysosomes increase size , produce vacuole impair cellular function induce unknown mechanism . Clinical Findings : Affected child usually bear apparently normal condition worsens progressively without possible treatment available prevent evolution . The clinical finding alpha-mannosidosis include broad range symptom , early lethal form less symptomatic , chronic form often initially diagnose childhood . Alpha-mannosidosis frequently associate corneal opacity , aseptic destructive arthritis , metabolic myopathy immune deficiency . In past alpha-mannosidosis classify two form . A severe infantile ( type 1 ) phenotype include rapid , progressive mental retardation ; hepatosplenomegaly ; severe dysostosis multiplex ; often death 3 12 year age . The juvenile-adult phenotype ( type 2 ) characterize milder slowly progressive course survival adulthood . The distinction absolute , symptom lethality may vary . In affected child bear healthy , window opportunity therapy initiate early age contribute normal development prevention disease related complication . Study objectives : To assess short-term , natural history subject diagnose Alpha-Mannosidosis To establish range diversity clinical symptomatology To evaluate short term ( 24 month ) change disease parameter</detailed_description>
