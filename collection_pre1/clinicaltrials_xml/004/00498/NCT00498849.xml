	<brief_summary>The aim study ( 1 ) To genome-wide profile gene expression pattern peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ( 2 ) To profile gene expression pattern change treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) ( 3 ) To correlate altered gene expression severity disease outcome OSA patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Changes Patterns Microarray Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) characterize recurrent collapse upper airway sleep result hypoxia sleep fragmentation . Several systemic cardiovascular complication attribute OSAS , cause hypoxia burst sympathetic activity . Increase inflammatory mediator , include C-reactive protein , oxidative stress , adhesion molecule , vascular endothelial growth factor proinflammatory cytokine , think involve development cardiovascular disease patient OSAS . In preliminary study , serum level IL-6 CRP high patient OSAS control subject , level inversely correlate low pulse oxygen saturation . Factors trigger inflammatory cascade OSAS include hypoxia sympathetic hyperactivity . Hypoxia think trigger factor elevate production inflammatory mediator . Through induction transcriptional factor critical signaling pathway , hypoxia induces several physiologic response , like increase anaerobic metabolism , angiogenesis , vasodilation , erythropoiesis increase breathing . Microarray mature gene analysis technique far , allow high throughput analysis function many gene . Microarray use understand disease mechanism also useful improve disease diagnosis , disease classification , prognosis evaluation improve treatment outcome . In project , use oligo microarray genome-wide profile alter gene expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell OSAS patient ; correlate dysregulations gene expression clinical outcome . We also examine gene expression pattern change treatment CPAP . The information obtain approach useful understand pathogenic mechanism OSAS lead systemic cardiovascular complication . Further therapeutic intervention may therefore possible .</detailed_description>
