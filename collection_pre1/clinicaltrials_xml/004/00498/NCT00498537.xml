	<detailed_description>Spironolactone reduce proteinuria progression renal failure diabetic nephropathy Introduction : Diabetic nephropathy lead cause ESRD USA account 40 % new patient begin renal replacement therapy year . The number new patient start chronic dialysis therapy 70,000 year increase . This number include patient decline dialysis therapy die soon start dialysis . The economic human cost diabetic nephropathy therefore enormous . Aggressive control blood pressure especially ACE-inhibitor show reduce proteinuria progression renal dysfunction type 1 type 2 diabetic . Use ACE-inhibitor reduced proteinuria even normotensive diabetic microalbuminuria . However even optimal use ACE-Inhibitor progression renal dysfunction completely stop . Other additional treatment strategy therefore need explore . Studies animal small pilot study humans show nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker ( e.g . diltiazem verapamil ) may additional protective effect reduce proteinuria use conjunction ACE-inhibitor . Use angiotensin receptor blocker along ACE-inhibitors also try result dependable short sample size . While angiotensin play major role glomerular hemodynamics increase evidence aldosterone play significant role renal hemodynamics independent angiotensin . In remnant kidney model rat Greene et al show great 10-fold rise aldosterone remnant kidney rat ( REM ) compare SHAM operate one . As expect , proteinuria , hypertension glomerulosclerosis REM rat attenuate treatment ACE-inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( REM AIIA ) . However rat ( REM AIIA ) treat aldosterone infusion proteinuria , hypertension glomerulosclerosis see similar REM alone rat , suggest deleterious renal hemodynamic effect aldosterone independent angiotensin II . Use spironolactone rat transiently reduce proteinuria lower arterial pressure . Previous experiment remnant kidney model also show adrenalectomy adequate glucocorticoid replacement reduce proteinuria evidence renal injury usually see REM rat . Similarly heparin administration provide remarkably complete protection injury remnant kidney model . Although effect could due several action heparin ( anticoagulant hemodynamic ) , could due know suppressive action heparin aldosterone synthesis . In stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat ( SHRSP ) , renal vascular injury cause proteinuria malignant nephrosclerotic lesion markedly reduce treatment spironolactone , aldosterone receptor blocker . The effect spironolactone alone comparable effect treatment captopril , ACE-inhibitor . In study Rocha et al show ameliorate effect ACE-inhibition SHRSP rat could fully reverse infusion aldosterone , suggest major role aldosterone vascular injury rat well . Importantly deleterious effect aldosterone protective effect spironolactone end organ damage SHRSP rat appear independent blood pressure effect . In another experiment , Wistar-Furth rat , inbred strain resistant action mineralocorticoid , use study concept mineralocorticoid contribute progressive renal injury . Renal damage , evidence albuminuria glomerulosclerosis , response 5/6 nephrectomy markedly less Wistar-Furth rat compare Wistar rat . Treatment hypertension see nephrectomized Wistar rat protect renal injury suggest mineralocorticoid mediate deleterious effect independent blood pressure effect . Hyperaldosteronism note component clinical chronic renal insufficiency various etiology . In cross sectional study patient mild moderate renal insufficiency Hene et al observe level serum aldosterone increase creatinine clearance fell 70 cc/min go high 3-4 fold baseline . Similarly study 9 patient average inulin clearance 27cc/min , Bauer Reams note plasma aldosterone level four fold great normal . The significance Hyperaldosteronism progression renal insufficiency study systematically , one longitudinal study Walker note significant correlation aldosterone level rate progression renal failure . In longitudinal study 131 diabetic cohort , Walker note hypertension , plasma angiotensin II aldosterone independent predictor accelerate loss renal function . Although distal tubule consider target aldosterone action , aldosterone receptor find myocardium , vascular smooth muscle cell glomeruli .In vitro study culture mesangial cell reveal increased production type IV collagen incubation aldosterone . In double blind control study MacFadyen colleague observe spironolactone treatment reduce circulating level procollagen type III N-terminal amino peptide , marker vascular collagen turnover . Weber investigator observe aldosterone cause myocardial fibrosis effect could ameliorate treatment spironolactone . In addition classical genomic action type 1 mineralocorticoid receptor , aldosterone know significant non-genomic mediate action many different tissue include kidney tubule vascular smooth muscle cell . Aldosterone also regulate Angiotensin II membrane receptor thereby multiply vascular effect Ang II . This upregulation inhibit treatment spironolactone . These finding consistent synergistic action Ang II aldosterone production vascular injury first propose Masson et al almost 4 decade ago . The use ACE inhibitor may strongly inhibit RAAS , suppressive effect aldosterone production may satisfactory . Indeed , hypertension well CHF , continuous treatment ACE inhibitor produce sufficient decrease plasma aldosterone level , remain high increase eventually long term use . In one study , patient treat hefty dos captopril ( 300 mg/day ) double plasma aldosterone level end 12 month therapy despite marked decrease ANG II level . The reason unsatisfactory suppressive effect ACE inhibitor plasma aldosterone could partly due tachyphylaxis also likely due predominance non-RAAS component control system aldosterone production . Urinary clearance aldosterone may also reduce CHF CRF . On basis understanding , spironolactone ( 25-50 mg day ) use large multi-centered randomized control trial treatment congestive heart failure already receive standard therapy Ace inhibitor , diuretic digoxin . The study terminate midway interim analysis show 30 % reduction mortality spironolactone treat group oppose control . Of note , incidence hyperkalemia treatment group 1.7 % oppose 1 % placebo group . The incidence gynecomastia also modest ( 10 % Vs 1 % ) spite use drug like digoxin know also cause gynecomastia . Planned Study : For study recruit patient renal clinic VA medical center also patient primary care clinic hospital . The study double blind control study use patient control period wash phase . Inclusion criteria Patients diabetic nephropathy ( proteinuria exceed 100 mg per day ace inhibitor ) already treat ACE-Inhibitor maximum tolerate dose . For lisinopril dose usually 20-40 mg per day . Patients angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) due inability tolerate ace inhibitor ( e.g . due cough ) also consider study provide stay ARB dose throughout study period . Exclusion criterion : Serum creatinine great 2.0 mg/dl Serum K great 5.0 meq/L Patients need use spironolactone reason Life expectancy less 1 year For pilot phase study investigate 30 patient ( see attach sample size calculation ) equally divide control treatment group . Patients randomly allocate different group use computer generate randomization sequence . After 3 month study medication ( placebo ) study group patient switch placebo group vice versa . Thus patient control . There month wash period change . Study drug : Study drug spironolactone . The start dose 25 mg orally every day , increase 50 mg every day , tolerate 4 week . A matching placebo use placebo group . The VA pharmacy prepare provide study drug well placebo . The pharmacy create maintain randomization number safe place investigator study nurse remain blind whole randomization process throughout study period . Protocol lab study follow : All patient see one investigator brief history physical examination prior randomization . All patient blood pressure measure study nurse sit position ( average two BP reading take 5 minute interval record ) . Patients weigh visit also . The study related visit would prior randomization , day randomization , 1 month 3 month study . The cycle repeat patient one month washout period study drug reverse ( placebo study study placebo ) All patient follow lab study begin ( prior randomization ) , 1 month 3 month clinic visit : Renal panel 24 hour urine protein creatinine Renal panel do prescribe study visit clinical reason . All patient continue usual medication study period change make deem necessary clinician take care patient . As far possible dose ace inhibitor ( angiotensin receptor blocker ) keep begin randomization . Doses calcium channel blocker ( ) also change much possible study .</detailed_description>
