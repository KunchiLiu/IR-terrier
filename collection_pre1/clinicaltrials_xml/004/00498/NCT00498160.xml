	<brief_title>Induction Donor Specific Tolerance Recipients Live Donor Kidney Allografts Donor Stem Cell Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present time , kidney transplant recipient must take anti-rejection medication prevent rejection donate kidney . Even medication , chronic rejection common cause late graft loss . The anti-rejection agent significantly toxic , side effect include kidney damage , infection increase incidence cancer . The goal study allow patient develop `` tolerance '' transplant kidney maintain competent immune system . Tolerance enable transplant recipient 's body recognize transplanted organ self rather foreign tissue . The recipient try reject donor kidney need anti-rejection medication could dramatically decrease eliminate entirely . To accomplish , patient study receive specially treat bone marrow take kidney donor . Bone marrow transplant show animal study human induce tolerance follow organ transplant . Two factor limit application donor marrow transplant induce tolerance : 1 ) prepare patient transplant ( condition ) ; 2 ) graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Traditional conditioning destroy recipient 's immune system require marrow transplant successful patient unable fight infection donor cell survive . GVHD occur donor immune cell recognize recipient 's cell foreign tissue attack . Severe GVHD result death . This study utilize new approach conditioning leave patient 's immune system intact . The transplant product deplete GVHD-producing cell retain tolerance-promoting facilitating cell , intend ensure donor recipient cell coexist peacefully , state call mixed chimerism . The toxicity condition transplantation significantly reduce . In study , determine appropriate cell dose safely establish mixed chimerism follow partial condition live donor decease donor kidney transplant recipient . The study take gradual approach increase cell dose achieve mixed chimerism . We believe study provide breakthrough approach kidney transplantation . Our goal evaluate potential safely establish mixed chimerism induce tolerance follow kidney transplant reduce eliminate need anti-rejection therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must age 18 65 year meet institution 's criterion renal transplantation endorgan failure Patient receiving first renal transplant Patient receive renal transplant The crossmatch negative donor recipient Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine test acceptable ) within 48 hour initiate total body irradiation ( TBI ) agree use reliable contraception 1 year follow transplant Note : The subject need local resident order eligible trial , must willing reside area , within four hour drive , first three month protocol monitor closely early post transplant period . As long insurance funding cover cost transplant research related complication , necessary subject US citizens participate trial . Clinically active bacterial , fungal , viral parasitic infection Pregnancy Clinical serologic evidence viral infection would preclude recipient receive kidney transplant Previous radiation therapy dose would preclude TBI Positive crossmatch donor recipient Evidence immunologic memory donor BMI &gt; 35 &lt; 18</criteria>
