	<detailed_description>Background Physical activity think key element prevent obesity epidemic associate cardiovascular metabolic disease . However population-based study direct promote physical activity youth show limited success obesity prevention . The aim study ass whether intervention integrate socioecological change , potential induce sustain change physical activity , prevents overweight cardiovascular risk adolescent . Methods Population design : The Intervention Centered Adolescents ' Physical activity Sedentary behavior ( ICAPS ) 4-year randomize prevention study target 6th grader ( e.g . 12 year old adolescent ) . The study design base randomization school level follow intention-to-treat principle . Eight school ( four intervention school four control ) randomly select 77 public middle school Department Bas-Rhin ( Eastern France ) . To balance potential confounding factor ensure broad socioeconomic context , randomization do stratification sociogeographical criterion . Intervention status school randomize pair match school . All initially first-level student randomized school eligible participate . Intervention : The 4-year intervention program design promote physical activity change attitude debate access attractive activity , provide social support environmental change encourage physical activity . The student control school follow usual school curriculum physical education class submit intervention . Outcomes follow-up : The primary outcome subject ' body mass index ( BMI ) . Prespecified secondary end point include body composition , physical activity sedentary behavior , attitude towards physical activity , various cardiovascular risk factor . Surveys take place baseline annually end school year . Fasting blood sample baseline every two year . Physical examination perform qualified professional questionnaire administer small group 3 6 student . All procedure standardize among school interviewer regularly trained assure reliability measurement . Statistical analysis : Outcome data analyze use mixed linear model take account cluster randomization design repeat individual data . Random effect school within intervention group individual within school . Possible heterogeneity intervention 's effect accord gender initial weight status test . Perspectives This study assess feasibility efficacy multilevel multipartnership prevention program target adolescent ' physical activity .</detailed_description>
