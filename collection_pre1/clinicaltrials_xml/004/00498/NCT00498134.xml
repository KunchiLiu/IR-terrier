	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer second lead cause cancer deaths World . In China , gastric cancer exceed cancer mortality except lung cancer . Helicobacter pylori infection important cause gastric cancer . We previously start randomize placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial Changle 1994 address issue whether eradication H. pylori alone able prevent reduce risk gastric cancer . The project involved 1600 subject still ongoing . On hand , laboratory research indicate abnormally high expression enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 found gastric cancer inhibition enzyme new drug ( specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor ) could kill cancer cell . The drug approve use treatment hereditary colon cancer syndrome ( Familial Adenomatous Polyposis , FAP ) , rationale tumour suppressive property drug . We initiate second chemoprevention study assess addition specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor together eradication H. pylori prevention reduction risk gastric cancer ass whether combination reverse pre-cancerous lesion stomach high-risk population . The propose site Shangdong , China high prevalence pre-cancerous lesion asymptomatic H. pylorus carrier . We plan recruit 1500 H. pylorus positive subject randomize placebo-controlled study . H. pylori carrier randomize receive treatment infection placebo , follow specific COX-2 inhibitor placebo 3 year . The result significant impact prevention gastric cancer national scale worldwide .</brief_summary>
