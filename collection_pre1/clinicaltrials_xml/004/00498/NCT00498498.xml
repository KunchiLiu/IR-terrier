	<brief_summary>The goal study answer follow question : - What time course expect change endothelin level first two week injury relate outcome ? - What relation endothelin level ( big ET-1 ET-1 ) plasma cerebrospinal fluid type injury , CT scan GCS ? - What relation endothelin level ( big ET-1 ET-1 ) plasma cerebrospinal fluid outcome measurement like GOSE , ICP CT scan ? - What relation neurohormone relate neutral endopeptidase ( NEP ) ( ANP , BNP cGMP ) plasma cerebrospinal fluid type injury , CT scan GCS ? - What relation endothelin level ( big ET-1 ET-1 ) plasma cerebrospinal fluid marker apoptosis ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) remain critical problem United States throughout world . Advances critical care TBI patient result improved outcome . However , despite effort , half patient severe brain injury die leave severe disability . Thus , need pharmaceutical agent blunt cascade neurotoxin release mechanical head trauma improve outcome critically important . One neurotoxins endothelin , potent vasoactive peptide , consider play major role TBI , particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage concomitant vasospasm . However , relatively little known regard up-regulation toxin head injury . Thus , purpose observational study document level endothelin cerebrospinal fluid plasma patient brain injury 14 day period . Aliquots CSF blood obtain 12 hour interval long ventriculostomy sample CSF require routine management . Additional information regard severity injury , CT pathology , intracranial pressure , neurologic assessment , CSF biomarkers , transcranial doppler ultrasound also collect . The study implement among 12 centers,8 U.S.A 3 Europe 1 Canada , provide average approximately 5 patient per center period 7 month . The study may extend base interim analysis endothelin level various injury severity level . Data collect coordinated American Brain Injury Consortium utilize web-based entry system . Following completion accrual final report assemble ABIC serve basis scientific publication provide reference data future development clinical trial utilize endothelin system .</detailed_description>
