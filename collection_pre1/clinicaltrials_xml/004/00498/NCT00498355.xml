	<detailed_description>Uveitis , inflammation affect uvea ( iris , ciliary body choroid ) , important cause visual loss . There 30,000 new case legal blindness year due uveitis U.S. Sight-threatening complication associate uveitis include macular edema , may persist even inflammation control . The current treatment cystoid macular edema ( CME ) uveitis patient oral regional steroid injection . For patient n't respond steroid unable tolerate steroid therapy , medical treatment . The aim propose research determine ranibizumab effective treatment patient uveitis-induced CME unable treat non-responsive steroid . Ranibizumab recombinant , humanize monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment ( Fab ) neutralize active form vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF suspect play role loss vascular integrity eye , think involve pathogenesis macular edema eye patient uveitis . Ranibizumab approve FDA treatment neovascular age-related macular degeneration June 30 , 2006 , number publish paper show efficacy cause macular edema , include due diabetes mellitus . The F. I. Proctor Foundation UCSF enrol 10 subject 18 year age old uveitis-induced CME clinically evaluate safety effectiveness ranibizumab administer monthly three month follow PRN monthly dosing ( 12 month ) . The study measure visual acuity , change foveal thickness optical coherence tomography , change cystoid macular edema fluorescein angiograpy determine efficacy ranibizumab treatment .</detailed_description>
