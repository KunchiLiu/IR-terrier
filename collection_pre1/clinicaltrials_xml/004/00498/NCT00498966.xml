	<brief_title>Ph II Study Perifosine Patients With Carcinoma Kidney</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II study . Patients kidney carcinoma consider two group . Patients group A previously fail VEGF receptor inhibitor mTOR inhibitor , patient group B fail VEGF receptor inhibitor mTOR inhibitor . Evaluation group perform separately . The goal study : 1 . To measure clinical benefit define objective tumor response use RESIST progression-free survival 12 week patient metastatic carcinoma kidney fail progressed VEGF receptor inhibitor 2 . To evaluate safety perifosine patient metastatic carcinoma kidney fail progressed VEGF receptor inhibitor . Treatment Phase/duration treatment : All patient treat daily perifosine 100 mg PO daily tumor progression ( RECIST criterion ) unacceptable toxicity . Once radiological disease progression document treat physician , patient go study . Patients encourage two measurement confirmation progression . Follow-Up Phase : All patient followed-up SAEs least 30 day discontinuation perifosine . All patient discontinue perifosine reason disease progression continue tumor assessment patient document disease progression begin therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients confirm metastatic RCC Patients must document progression treatment sunitinib sorafenib . Prior therapy bevacizumab and/or cytokine ( i.e. , IL2 , interferon ) permit . Prior vaccine therapy adjuvant set also permit . Patients fail therapy ONE prior mTOR inhibitor . Patients must least one measurable lesion computer tomography ( CT ) Scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use Modified RECIST criterion . Patients must normal organ marrow function , unless opinion treat investigator , abnormality related tumor , study chairman agree abnormality unlikely affect safety perifosine use . Normal organ marrow function describe : ANC &gt; = 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; = 75,000/ mm3 HCT &gt; = 28 % ( without growth factor support ) Creatinine &lt; = 3.0 mg/dl Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal Transaminase &lt; = 2.5 x upper limit normal ECOG performance status 0 1 Patients CNS metastasis must clinically stable least 2 month follow treatment radiation therapy , surgery , ; corticosteroid antiseizure medication . Patients life expectancy ≥6 month Age ≥18 year old Patients give write informed consent obtain accord local guideline Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test 72 hour prior administration first study treatment . Patients recover ( &lt; = grade 1 ) adverse event prior therapy ( exclude alopecia ) . Patients currently receive sorafenib sunitinib receive either within 2 week prior study entry . Patients may prior sorafenib OR sunitinib BUT treat VEGF receptor inhibitor . Patients know hypersensitivity perifosine excipients . Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Patients use investigational agent receive investigational drug &lt; = 4 week prior study entry . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol . Patients history another primary malignancy &lt; = 5 year exception non melanomatous skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix .</criteria>
