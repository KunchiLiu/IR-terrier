	<brief_summary>Chronic fatigue syndrome disable illness specific treatment . As group , CFS patient disturb sleep frequent arousal sense sleep upon awaken . Xyrem ( Sodium oxybate ) know improve deep sleep may reduce sleep disturbance CFS lead well sleep less fatigue . Its ability produce rapid onset deep sleep reason become street drug , availability currently limit via distribution single centralize pharmacy . Xyrem successfully use base result study patient fibromyalgia ( FM ) , ailment closely resemble CFS . However , study , researcher provide information whether patient FM alone FM plus CFS . Thus , clear study patient may help . I prescribe Xyrem patient FM CFS good result . In study , fund company make Xyrem , I propose test drug 's efficacy patient CFS alone - , fibromyalgia . Volunteers study complete paper pencil questionnaires symptom well computerized test ass degree brain fog . They randomly assign one two group , placebo drug . Volunteers know group end study . Only drug group receive medication . The placebo group receive substance look identical real medicine active ingredient . The medication come liquid patient start take initial dose 30 min expect sleep . If subject awaken less 5 hr sleep , take second dose . If sleep 5 hr , tell skip take second dose . We call patient weekly see `` drug . '' If tolerable side effect report significant improvement , maintain dose . But patient report effect treatment , dosage incremented 1 ml per week good sleep achieve predetermined maximum reach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medically unexplained fatigue occur 5 % population 10 % number fulfil formal case definition chronic fatigue syndrome1 . Medically unexplained fatigue major problem patient practitioner - effective FDA-approved treatment symptom . One major problem patient unrefreshing sleep . Formal sleep study show reduced total sleep time reduce sleep efficiency compare controls.2 ; 3 We currently early stage NIH-funded grant design study cytokine sleep . Preliminary result support awake time patient relative control , produce decreased sleep efficiency . These data lead work hypothesis problem severe daytime fatigue due previously unappreciated form sleep pathology relate sleep fragmentation . Patients medically unexplained pain also complain disturbed sleep . Sodium oxybate test patient complaint fulfill formal case definition fibromyalgia find reduce symptom improve sleep quality.4 Specifically , six 7 pain/fatigue score ( overall pain , pain rest , pain movement , end day fatigue , overall fatigue , morning fatigue ) relieve 29 % 33 % sodium oxybate , compare 6 % 10 % relief placebo ( p &lt; 0.005 ) . Alpha intrusion indicative disturbed sleep , sleep latency , rapid-eye-movement sleep significantly decrease , slow-wave ( stage 3/4 ) sleep significantly increase , compare placebo ( p &lt; 0.005 ) . Two 5 subjective sleep relate variable significantly different placebo : morning alertness ( improved 18 % sodium oxybate , compare 2 % placebo ; p = 0.0033 ) quality sleep ( improved 33 % 10 % , respectively ; p = 0.0003 ) . Importantly , approximately 40 % patient study group fulfill case definition simultaneously CFS FM . Since know patient either sodium oxybate treatment trial CFS , sure whether efficacy specific FM instead may occur due fact large representation CFS occur . An unpublished Phase II randomize double-blind placebo control trial FM , do Jon Russell colleague Dallas present 2005 meeting American College Rheumatology , report substantial symptom improvement statistically significant benefit self report pain scale patient global impression improvement dose sodium oxybate test compare placebo [ 4.5g [ 9ml ] total dose per night ; p=0.005 6g [ 12 ml ] , p=0.048 ] . Improvement outcome variable 34.5 % 4.5g 27.3 % 6g compare 12.5 % placebo group . I prescribe sodium oxybate practice patient CFS FM good result . Anecdotally , patient report less pain also report good quality sleep le fatigue upon awaken . This lead hypothesize sodium oxybate reduce fatigue patient CFS alone ( i.e. , without also FM ) . To test hypothesis , I propose double blind , placebo control trial sodium oxybate 30 patient fulfill formal case definition chronic fatigue syndrome also FM .</detailed_description>
