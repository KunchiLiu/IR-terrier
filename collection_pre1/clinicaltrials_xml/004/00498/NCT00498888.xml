	<brief_summary>- Urinary Urge Incontinence ( UUI ) involuntary urine loss associate strong sensation void . - UUI usually associate reduced bladder capacity . - The pathophysiology unclear . - Pelvic floor muscle dysfunction detrusor instability suggest possible mechanism . - Standard treatment include anticholinergic medication behavior modification . - The study aim compare long term effectiveness 4 different approach treatment woman Urge Urinary Incontinence ( UUI ) : 1 . Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation ( include muscle training+behavioral intervention+bladder training ) 2 . Pelvic Floor muscle train alone 3 . Bladder Training alone 4 . Drug treatment Tolterodine . - Study variable include : impairment rating , quality life , cost-effectiveness . - This study address three issue : 1 . The long term efficacy cost-effectiveness various treatment option . 2 . To identify factor involve determine effectiveness drug behavioral therapy . 3 . The pathophysiology UUI . By subdivide rehabilitation group 3 arm , hope shed light mechanism dysfunction . A good response one group help localize problem pelvic floor muscle detrusor instability .</brief_summary>
