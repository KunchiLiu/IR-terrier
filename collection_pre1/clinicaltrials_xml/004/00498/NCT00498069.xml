	<criteria>Diagnosis Critical Limb Ischemia per protocol ( see diagnostic criterion # 2 ) regard study limb . Existence PAOD clinical presentation correspond Rutherford Category 4 Category 5 define reporting standard adopt Society Vascular Surgeons ( table 1 ) Patient meet least one follow diagnostic criterion study limb : Ankle artery occlusion pressure absolute &lt; 50 mmHg ABI &lt; 0.4 Toe artery occlusive pressure &lt; 40mm Hg TBI ( &lt; 0.4 ) TcPO2 &lt; 20 mmHg lie breathing room air . There reasonable open surgical endovascular revascularization option determine treat vascular specialist . Factors may contribute determination inoperability may include : Anatomical consideration No outflow target No appropriate conduit ( i.e . vein bypass ) Long segment occlusion calcify lesion predict poor outcome endovascular approach . High risk medical condition Unstable cardiac disease . Renal insufficiency History prior fail revascularization attempt The patient 's unsuitability must confirm 2 qualified physician . The attend vascular surgeon provide primary assessment . The confirmatory opinion must come fully license physician . ( resident ) If anatomical consideration invoke , second physician may vascular surgeon , interventional radiologist , cardiologist , vascular medicine specialist . If medical comorbidity deem high risk aspect , confirmatory opinion may obtain internist , family physician , cardiologist , vascular medicine , nephrologists , vascular surgeon . Age &gt; 18 year ability understand plan treatment Subject read sign IRB approve Informed Consent form Patients follow medication ( ) prescribe must one month stable baseline appropriate/maximally tolerate therapy prior enrollment : Plavix/asprin therapy , anticoagulation therapy , cholesterol lower agent , blood pressure medication Hematocrit ≥ 28.0 % , White Blood Cell count ≤ 14,000 , Platelet count ≥ 50,000 , Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg / dL , INR ≤ 1.6 unless Coumadin , PTT &lt; 1.5 x control ( avoid bleeding complication ) Patients Coumadin correct prior procedure must INR &lt; 1.6 time randomization/surgery . Life expectancy &lt; 6 month due concomitant illness History bone marrow disease ( especially NHL , MDS ) prohibit transplantation Terminal renal failure exist dependence dialysis Known active malignancy result outside normal limit follow test : PAP , Chest Xray , PSA , Mammogram , Hemoccult unless followup study reveal patient cancer free.. Poorly control diabetes mellitus ( HgbA1C &gt; 10 % ) Medical risk precludes anesthesia ( conscious sedation ) , ASA Class 5 Lifethreatening complication ischemia necessitate immediate amputation Uncorrected iliac artery occlusion index side No Doppler signal foot ( ABI =0 ) Extensive necrosis index limb condition make amputation inevitable ( Rutherford Category 6 ) Active clinical infection treat antibiotic within one week enrollment Treatment immunosuppressant drug ( include Prednisone &gt; 5 mg per day ) . Female pregnant nursing , child bear potential use reliable birth control method . Underwent major open cardiovascular surgical procedure ( carotid endarterectomy , arterial aneurysm bypass surgery , coronary artery bypass surgery ) myocardial infarction within 3 month prior randomization Cerebrovascular accident within 6 month prior randomization .</criteria>
