	<brief_summary>Chronic liver disease often characterize portal hypertension , major complication involve haemodynamic change due increase intrahepatic vascular resistance . It become well establish nitric oxide ( NO ) play crucial role haemodynamic abnormality develop chronic portal hypertension . NCX-1000 NO-releasing derivative ursodeoxycholic acid would compensate defective liver NO production cirrhosis . This study intend demonstrate desire therapeutic activity ( reduction portal pressure ) small number target patient , assess safety tolerability repeat oral administration NCX-1000 , get preliminary pharmacokinetic data population .</brief_summary>
