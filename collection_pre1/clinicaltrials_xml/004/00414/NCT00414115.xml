	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( 1 ) identify collect sample child adult take drug adverse drug reaction AND child adult take drug experience adverse drug effect ; ( 2 ) determine genetic difference two group contribute cause adverse drug reaction ; ( 3 ) develop patient specific drug dose guideline prevent future adverse drug reaction . We also wish compare use prescription drug , medical hospital service vital statistic BC participant experience adverse drug reaction . Study hypothesis : Genetic difference may contribute patient ' response drug may responsible adverse drug reaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CPNDS identify ADR predictive marker compare DNA plasma sample patient suffer ADRs sample control population stratify medication type age . The GATC obtain clinical material ADR patient mainly , hospital-based active surveillance network across Canada 's major hospital . 1 . CPNDS examine know SNPs candidate gene relate ADR ( i.e . drug metabolism gene , drug transporter gene , drug target gene , disease-specific gene gene related physiological pathway ADR . ) 2 . CPNDS discover novel ADR predictive SNPs mutation sequence DNA sample patient cohort . CPNDS also genotype sequence DNA sample population control receive drug , suffer ADRs ; second population control patient represent random sample population know ethnic background . Novel ADR predictive SNPs mutation functionally validate pharmacokinetic approach apply time course analysis drug concentration specific genotype . Pharmacokinetic study also use determine drug concentration patient characterize possible mechanism ADR , translate rational approach choice candidate gene examine genomic analysis . The cost-effectiveness ADR screen program prevention ADRs child adult calculate detailed health-economic study .</detailed_description>
