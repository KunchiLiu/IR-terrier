	<detailed_description>The primary objective study investigate ratio p-hydroxyatorvastatin atorvastatin patient receive atorvastatin treatment , experience muscle adverse event , elucidate whether difference ratio might positive negative predictive value diagnose atorvastatin muscle toxicity . If show , measurement atorvastatin metabolites patient experience muscle adverse event might valuable diagnostic tool diagnose myopathy associate statin treatment . The primary endpoint cut level present myotoxicity set ratio p-hydroxyatorvastatin /atorvastatin 0.15 previously perform pilot study ( Unpublished data , Herman M et al ) . Values ratio consider clinical significant indicia statin relate myopathy . Secondary objective include descriptively investigation drug metabolite cut ratio atorvastatin lactone/atorvastatin . Whether cut value , p-hydroxyatorvastatin well atorvastatin lactone , give precise identification patient experience statin relate myopathy compare control also investigate . Explorative objective study investigate possible vitro phenotypic difference isolate muscle cell patient experience muscle toxicity compare patient experience muscle toxicity . If genetic difference patient experience myotoxicity , difference likely show phenotypic difference vitro study isolate muscle cell . If phenotypic difference present vitro possible mechanistic cause investigate .</detailed_description>
