	<brief_title>Letrozole Versus Observation Patients With Newly Diagnosed Uterine Leiomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Letrozole aromatase inhibitor . Aromatase enzyme produce estrogen post-menopausal woman . By interfere production estrogen trigger aromatase , letrozole reduces total amount estrogen body . As result , less estrogen reach cancer cell , thus prevent growth . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . These exam , test , procedure part regular cancer care may do even join study . If recently , may need repeat . This study doctor . Your complete medical history record , physical exam ( include pelvic exam ) . Your vital sign blood pressure measure . Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You also blood test ( 1 teaspoon ) check cholesterol . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . You also chest x-ray , either compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) check status disease . Your doctor test previously collect tumor tissue learn estrogen receptor positive negative . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 group . Group 1 receive letrozole mouth day . Group 2 receive treatment . Both group follow closely every 3 month . You equal chance place either group . If Group 1 , take letrozole mouth every day 12 week . Every 12 week consider study `` cycle . '' You give amount drug need 1 cycle therapy time . You keep diary study list much drug take . This diary review cycle therapy research nurse doctor file chart . Every 12 week , participant blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . CT scan chest , abdomen ( stomach area ) , pelvis do every 24 week . In addition , participant physical exam ( include pelvic exam ) , vital sign blood pressure measure . You may remain study long benefitting . You take study intolerable side effect occur . Once study , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test measure cholesterol level . You physical exam ( include pelvic exam ) , MRI CT scan . This investigational study . Letrozole approve FDA treatment breast cancer patient surgery . Its use patient leiomyosarcoma experimental . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
