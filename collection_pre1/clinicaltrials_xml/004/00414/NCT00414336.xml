	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety experimental vaccine protect people malaria study effect . Malaria , affect many people Mali country Africa , cause germ spread mosquito bite . In Mali , disease lead cause death . Researchers Malaria Research Training Center University Bamako work NIH develop experimental vaccine disease . The vaccine , call AMA1-C1Alhydrogel ( AMA1-C1 ) , contain small part malaria-causing germ . CPG-7909 product improve body 's reaction vaccine . Patients age 18 45 good health , live Don gu bougou , Mali , plan stay study duration , pregnant breast feeding may eligible study . There 24 participant . At initial evaluation 2 3 hour , patient physical examination undergo blood urine test regard blood , kidney , liver . During study , patient receive two injection one two experimental malaria vaccine . Injections vaccine time , 4 week apart , give arm muscle . Patients receive either AMA1-C1 AMA1-C1 CPG-7909 know vaccine receive study 's end . After injection , patient stay clinic 30 minute observation . They return 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 day examine report feeling . Blood urine sample collect visit . Each clinic visit take 1 2 hour . If reason patient receive one injection , ask return clinic routine visit study 's end . After first 2 month , patient return clinic month 30 week . In period , 12 blood sample take . Researchers want sure vaccine harmful well measure vaccine 's effect . Risks study include pain , swell , redness injection site ; fever ; gastrointestinal problem . Some people temporary decrease white blood cell receive vaccine . There small chance severe allergic reaction . However , researcher closely watch patient immediately injection give treatment serious reaction occurs . Participants receive 75 kilo rice 75 kilo millet ( 165 lb . ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Safety Immunogenicity AMA1-C1Alhydrogel + CPG 7909 Vaccine Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMA1-C1 + CPG 7909 blood stage malaria vaccine candidate . The primary objective Phase 1 study evaluate safety reactogenicity vaccine semi-immune adult Mali . Secondary objective evaluate immunogenicity vaccine . The study double blind Phase 1 clinical trial healthy adult volunteer . Volunteers screen 24 participant enrol randomly assign one two group : 12 volunteer receive two dos 80 microgram AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500 microgram CPG ; 12 volunteer receive 80 microgram AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel , 1-month dosing interval . Safety outcome measure local systemic ( include laboratory ) adverse event . Immune responses vaccination measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) growth inhibition assay ( GIA ) , compare group . Peripheral blood lymphocyte assay presence AMA-1-specific memory B cell total number memory B cell .</detailed_description>
