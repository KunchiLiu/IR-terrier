	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Short-Term Anti-HIV Drug Therapy Recent HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 6 month infection , HIV viral load reach temporarily stable level know virus set point . Virus set point different patient predictor disease progression . Preliminary study indicate early , short-term antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) give people newly infect HIV may lead low virus set point preserve CD4 count . However , length short-term treatment need balance possible adverse effect ART achievement low virus set point yet know . By lower virus set point maintain CD4 count , need long-term ART may postpone . The purpose study determine safety efficacy short course ART produce low virus set point adult recently infect HIV . This study last least 28 week . Participants randomly assign one two arm . Arm A receive ART 12 week emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF/FTC ) daily lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ) tablet form twice daily . After 12 week , treatment interrupt unless CD4 count measure less 350 cells/mm^3 two consecutive occasion treatment interruption . If occurs therapy resume . Participants Arm B receive treatment cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) count drop 350 cells/mm^3 , indicate ART need . Study visit occur study entry , Weeks 2 4 , every 4 week thereafter . At study visit , physical exam , blood collection , completion adherence questionnaire occur . Participants encourage enroll relate substudy evaluate HIV viral load genital secretion .</detailed_description>
