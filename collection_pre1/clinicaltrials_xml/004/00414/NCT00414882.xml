	<brief_summary>The purpose study see one plan identify treat tuberculosis ( TB ) work well another reduce new case TB . The first plan DOTS program , provide free TB treatment people seek . The second plan provide free TB treatment people seek involves program staff go door-to-door community identify new case TB , DOTS plus active case-finding program ( ACF ) . Researchers believe detect TB case earlier supervise treatment help prevent spread decrease TB area . The study population 200,000 people 6 community Santa Cruz 14 community Northeast Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , receive DOTS DOTS plus ACF . Individuals DOTS plus ACF part study interview 2-4 time 9 month period . Patients symptoms provide sputum specimen . Patients identified TB begin treatment observe 6 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cluster-Randomized Trial DOTS v DOTS Plus Active Case Finding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) continue major cause morbidity mortality worldwide , particularly develop country . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate one-third world 's population infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Tuberculosis remain major public health problem Brazil , 15th high TB burden world . The goal project determine whether TB active case finding ( ACF ) conjunction directly observe therapy ( DOTS ) result low incidence TB compare routine DOTS alone . This community-randomized trial conduct 20 Rio de Janeiro community within 2 APs high rate TB community health worker health unit undergo intensive training implement DOTS program . This collaborative effort Municipal Health Secretariat Rio de Janeiro Johns Hopkins University Center Tuberculosis Research . A cluster-randomized trial conduct compare impact 2 case detection treatment strategy community incidence TB . The 20 community within 2 plan area ( APs ) randomly assign routine DOTS base passive case detection DOTS+ACF , TB case actively detect community outreach . In community , case TB identify exist TB clinic use identical procedure subject report TB clinic accord . These subject identify traditional method passive case finding ( PCF ) . In DOTS+ACF community , household survey community health worker identify individual cough great equal 3 week , symptomatic subject provide spot sputum specimen acid-fast bacillus smear time household survey . Results return subject home appropriate follow-up measure provide confirm TB diagnose provide treatment . The primary objective study compare TB incidence community randomize DOTS+ACF DOTS alone 18-month period follow ACF campaign . The study hypothesize average TB incidence 18 month 42 % less DOTS+ACF arm compare DOTS-arm . The study two secondary objective . The first secondary objective compare case notification rate TB 2 arm study ACF campaign . Researchers hypothesize TB notification rate least 40 % great DOTS+ACF community ACF period study . The second secondary objective compare treatment completion rate 2 arm study . Researchers hypothesize subject detect ACF equal treatment completion rate ( +/- 5 % ) subject DOTS-arm . Tuberculosis diagnosis primary outcome measure . Treatment completion secondary outcome measure . The study population resident 20 community select , approximately 200,000 people restriction age . Diagnosing subject earlier ensure treat early less time spread disease contact .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All resident study community eligible survey home , regardless gender , age , ethnicity . In DOTS+ACF community , household survey symptomatic subject provide sputum specimen . The subject males female restriction age , without active TB , live community high prevalence TB . There exclusion woman minority study . Pregnant woman include TB live household TB case . Children include TB per routine practice survey DOTS+ACF arm symptoms parent 's verbal permission presence . All resident 20 select community eligible participate study . Consent request DOTS , standard care area . Verbal consent request use household data analyze effectiveness active case finding . However , even household refuse participate survey ( extremely unlikely part routine survey household currently participate ) include calculate TB incidence community .</criteria>
