	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare efficacy SCS use Precision implantable neurostimulation device conventional medical treatment ( nerve block + physical therapy ) subject recently-diagnosed Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) conservative treatment fail . There significant number patient CRPS conventional treatment ineffective SCS use last resort . If SCS effective earlier treatment continuum , would provide much need treatment alternative increase awareness utility SCS indication . It also possible early intervention SCS may limit disease progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard medical treatment moderate/severe chronic pain Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) usually inadequate . Sympathetic nerve block local anesthetic commonly employ case effective option . Nerve block consistently effective , however , utility compromise short duration relief . CRPS among pain etiology manage via Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) ; option quite effective provide long-term pain relief management CRPS . Importantly , SCS usually attempt treatment option , include nerve block ablative procedure , fail produce adequate pain relief . No study perform date comparing SCS series nerve block injection plus physical therapy . In context , may prudent consider SCS earlier treatment continuum . Instead oblige CRPS patient cycle numerous round injection , optimal clinical pain management may attain early implantation SCS system . This prospective clinical study compare relative efficacy SCS repeat nerve block physical therapy group subject moderate-to-severe CRPS pain . Patients never invasive treatment CRPS pain randomize either series sympathetic block plus physical therapy SCS . Changes pain , disability , quality life outcome assess follow visit well incidence outcomes subject elect cross alternate treatment option . This study generate insight best pain management strategy CRPS .</detailed_description>
