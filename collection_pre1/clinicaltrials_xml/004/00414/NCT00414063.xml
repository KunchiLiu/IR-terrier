	<brief_summary>This study examine whether difference energy ( calorie ) loss stool urine lean obese people . People gain weight amount calorie food eat great amount calorie body use support function activity . The balance caloric intake expenditure may affect amount calorie food absorb lose stool urine . This study examine whether difference food absorption relate obesity . Healthy normal volunteer 18 45 year age body mass index ( BMI ) 18-25 kg/m2 le 35 kg/m2 may eligible 15-day study . Participants admit Clinical Research Unit Phoenix Indian Medical Center study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Experimental diet dye marker : Subjects feed 2400-calorie diet 3400-calorie diet 3 day . On first day diet , blue dye marker add breakfast meal . A red marker add breakfast meal first day diet period . Urine collect begin breakfast first day diet breakfast last day diet . Stool sample collect entire diet period , appearance red dye stool . - 24-hour metabolic rate respiratory chamber : After first diet period , subject spend 24 hour respiratory chamber measure number calorie body burn day ass energy balance intake expenditure . - Stool sample : Stool sample collect day 1 2 study look parasites internal bleeding may affect nutrient absorption . - DXA scanning : This scan use low dose X-rays measure body fat . - Oral glucose tolerance test : For test diabetes , I.V . line ( needle attach small plastic tube ) insert arm vein . The subject drink sugar solution . Small blood sample draw I.V . subject drink solution five interval 3 ( Omega ) -hour test period . - Fasting blood test : On first day diet day diet complete blood sample drawn breakfast measure hormone may affect ability absorb food . At end study , participant may ask repeat experimental diet stool urine collection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity rise epidemic proportion world , result excessive energy intake low level energy expenditure . The effect nutrient absorption energy balance , , relative amount nutrient consume vs. amount excrete stool , report small study energy waste feces urine lean obese individual find different . However , study limit small sample size specifically design examine whether stool energy loss vary lean obese individual . In addition , little known reproducibility measurement energy loss stool urine . We propose investigate ( ) whether significant difference energy loss ( measure stool urine ) obese lean individual , ( ii ) examine reproducibility measurement . Because literature suggest role enteric bacterial flora obesity , also examine difference flora group . We plan study 25 obese 25 lean healthy non-smoking Caucasian men age 18 - 45 year old , take medication ( include medication weight loss , antibiotic probiotic ) examination difference nutrient energy loss . Of subject , 10 lean 10 obese individual invite repeat study test reproducibility measurement . All participant admit Clinical Research Unit 15 day . During stay , subject fed weight maintain diet 3 day , follow random cross-over design two experimental diet : 2400 kcal/d 3400 kcal/d diet 3 day . Twenty four-hour urine feces collection take place day experimental diet period . The energy content waste product well diet ( use duplicate plate analysis ) measure bomb calorimetry . Bacterial component feces extract repeated fractional centrifugation obtain bacterial mass use 16S rDNA-based oligonucleotide probe obtain bacterial flora . Primary result examine difference energy loss lean obese individual well reproducibility measurement stool urine energy content .</detailed_description>
