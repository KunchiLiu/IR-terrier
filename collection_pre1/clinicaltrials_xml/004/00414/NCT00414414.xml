	<brief_title>A RCT Prednisone Adjunctive Therapy Hospitalized Patients With Pulmonary TB HIV Co-infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) lead cause death people infect HIV worldwide . South Africa one high rate tuberculosis HIV sub Saharan Africa world . Infection HIV result activation latent form TB active form . In place like sub Saharan Africa HIV rate high TB spread incredible vigor . In order study phenomenon , conduct preliminary project , demonstrate approximately 250 patient active TB admit one urban South African hospital one month almost half infected HIV . One quarter die hospital . They young people average 32 year . We interested undertake clinical trial study novel therapy add exist antimicrobial regimen order reduce number people die TB . One therapy would addition prednisone , oral steroid , standard TB treatment regimen . Steroids show useful TB meningitis pericarditis HIV positive negative patient . However , steroid never test formal manner HIV patient pulmonary TB . We choose research South Africa since number patient need design clinical trial one present find environment . Prednisone cheap , easily obtainable thus sustainable intervention develop country . The impact research would affect international community include Canada would certainly last sustainable effect local community Pietermaritzburg , South Africa addition rest world .</detailed_description>
