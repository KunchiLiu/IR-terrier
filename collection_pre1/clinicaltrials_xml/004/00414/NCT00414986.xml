	<detailed_description>Evidence-based guideline primary care diabetes establish disseminate , yet adoption guideline community-based primary care practice disappoint . This effectiveness study propose randomize trial involve 54 community-based primary care practice test two innovative intervention improve diabetes depression care . One intervention , derive theoretically base efficacious program test setting , adopts broad focus seek improve diabetes depression care ) increase practice 's organizational capacity manage change , b ) implement sustain chronic care office system support clinician effort improve care diabetes . The intervention combine two integrated component . The first component utilize Improvement Facilitator ass practice 's current use chronic care office system organizational capacity manage change , provide feedback key stakeholder practice , work practice six month form Improvement Team address organizational capacity create sustain improvement implement chronic care system . In second component intervention , practice participate local Improvement Collaborative afford opportunity learn share experience implementation maintenance phase intervention five similar practice geographic area . The second intervention base traditional QI method focus chronic disease registry regular report physician . It also use PDSA cycle assist implement change . This intervention offer tool improve diabetes and/or asthma care . Both intervention evaluate two way . First , randomize trial use rigorous quantitative method measure 2 primary 3 secondary endpoint 9 18 month , include ) ADA Physician Recognition Program performance measure patient-report review medical record , b ) HEDIS measure acute phase management depression , c ) assessment extent practice implement physician use element chronic care model care diabetes depression . Change baseline 9 month assess adoption chronic care improvement , change 9 18 month assess sustainability improvement . Second , multimethod assessment process use analyze qualitative quantitative data separately understand intervention lead observed effect . The practice assessment strive understand component intervention effective , relative cost implementation , might improve . Successful component intervention refine make available collaborator project ; Copic Insurance Company Colorado Clinical Guidelines Collaborative , use statewide activity improve diabetes care .</detailed_description>
