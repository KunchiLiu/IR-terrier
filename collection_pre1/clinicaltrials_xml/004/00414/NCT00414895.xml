	<detailed_description>Heart transplantation become accepted therapy end-stage heart failure . Acute allograft rejection ( AR ) remain major cause mortality heart transplant recipient . Chronic rejection ( CR ) determine long-term prognosis cardiac transplantation responsible one third late death . Different non-invasive method evaluate detection AR , gold standard remain endomyocardial biopsy ( EMB ) . Very little known impact CR collateral circulation transplant patient . Since collateral circulation heart mainly part microcirculation , hypothesize less developed `` normal '' coronary atherosclerosis without microvascular lesion . The quantification CR non-invasive technique remain difficult . In context , need reliable non-invasive test avoid regularly invasive evaluation . Based consideration propose AR CR accurately detect differentiated use non-invasive quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography ( MCE ) .</detailed_description>
