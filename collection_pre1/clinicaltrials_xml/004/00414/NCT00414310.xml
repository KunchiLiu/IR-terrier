	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find decitabine , give without valproic acid , help control AML MDS . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine ( DAC ) w/ w/o Valproic Acid ( VPA ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decitabine valproic acid design cause change different group protein attach DNA ( genetic material cell ) , may cause cancer cell die . Researchers want see combination valproic acid decitabine help improve disease response well long response last treating MDS AML . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 group . Participants one group receive decitabine . Participants group receive decitabine valproic acid . You equal chance assign either group first . After 20 participant enrol group , great chance assign group show good result . Participants group receive decitabine Day 1 central venous catheter ( CVC ) vein 1 hour day 5 day . A central venous catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Participants assign also get valproic acid take drug mouth Days 1-7 ( 7 day row ) . On Day 0 ( day treatment begin ) Day 1 , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw Days 0 1 , 5 , 10 ( routine blood test find abnormal ) learn status disease . Routine blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) do 1-2 time weekly first cycle every 2-4 week cycle . You another bone marrow aspiration check disease response treatment , one every 1-3 cycle . One ( 1 ) cycle treatment 4-8 week long . You may remain study long benefit 2 year first achieve complete response . Your dose level may decrease depend side effect may experience . However , disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . This investigational study . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . Valproic acid FDA approve commercially available treatment seizure disorder . Up 150 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients MDS &gt; 5 % blast IPSS risk intermediate high ; patient CMML ; patient AML age 60 old . No prior intensive chemotherapy highdose araC ( &gt; 1g/m2 ) . No prior azacytidine 3 cycle prior decitabine 2 cycle . Prior biologic therapy , targeted therapy , single agent chemotherapy allowed.Patients must chemotherapy 2 week prior enter study recover toxic effect therapy , unless evidence rapidly progressive disease . 2 . Continued # 1 : Hydroxyurea permit control count prior treatment . Procrit , granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF ) allow therapy . Procrit , GCSF growth factor permit therapy . Use hydroxyurea rapidly proliferative disease allow first two week therapy . 3 . Performance 02 ( ECOG ) . Adequate liver function ( bilirubin &lt; 2mg/dl ) renal function ( creatinine &lt; 2mg/dl ) . Adequate cardiac function ( NYHA cardiac IIIIV exclude ) . ALT &lt; 2.5x institutional upper limit normal . 4 . Signed informed consent . 1 . Nursing pregnant female . Patients childbearing potential practice effective method contraception . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 2 . Active uncontrolled infection . 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Known ornithine transcarbamylase disorder . 5 . Patients require continuous valproic acid treatment control seizure disorder .</criteria>
