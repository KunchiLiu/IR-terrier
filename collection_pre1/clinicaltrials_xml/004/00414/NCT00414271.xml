	<brief_summary>Thymidylate Synthase ( TS ) key enzyme synthesis DNA target enzyme inhibited 5-fluorouracil . TS level tumour cell report predictive response 5-FU prognostic factor colorectal gastric cancer patient . We plan study TS IHC paraffin block tumour tissue . A combined comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) expression microarray analysis gastric cancer specimens neoadjuvant chemotherapy . CGH perform use standard technique routinely do Dr Patrick Tan 's laboratory National Cancer Centre , determine gain loss DNA copy chromosome . Total RNA extract least one biopsy sample contain least 50 % cancer cell homogenization tumour tissue tri-sol method . 5 ug RNA amplized hybridize C-DNA microarrays 18K target . Primary Objective 1 . Feasibility safety pre-operative chemotherapy locally advance gastric cancer . Secondary Objective 1 . Complete clinical pathological response rate pre-operative chemotherapy locally advance gastric cancer 2 . Complete resection rate . 3 . Time recurrence , disease free overall survival 4 . Correlation clinical outcome RUNX-3 methylation status Thymidylate synthetase tumor tissue . 5 . Correlation CGH gene expression profile change chemotherapy clinical outcome . Patients may include study meet follow criterion : Age least 18 year . Histologic cytologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma stomach gastric cardia ( Siewart Classification Type III ) Preoperative Stage T3-4NxM0 endoscopic ultrasound , CT abdomen/pelvis laparoscopy . ( CT chest cardia lesion ) . Absence malignant cell peritoneal lavage fluid laparoscopic examination . Patients must receive prior chemotherapy hormonal therapy treatment gastric cancer . Karnofsky performance status 70 high . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . Adequate organ function include follow : - Bone marrow : White blood cell ( WBC ) least 3.5 x 109/L Absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) least 1.5 x 109/L Platelets least 100 x 109/L Haemoglobin least 9g/dL - Hepatic : Bilirubin within upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT AST 2.5x ULN Alkaline phosphatase 2.5x ULN . - Renal : creatinine 1.5x ULN Signed informed consent patient legal representative . Patients reproductive potential must use approved contraceptive method appropriate ( eg , intrauterine device , birth control pill , barrier device ) three month study . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior study enrollment . The study plan recruit 30 patient 12-18 month .</brief_summary>
