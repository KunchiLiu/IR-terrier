	<brief_summary>Recently suggest restrictive transfusion unit Red Cells ( URC ) may improve outcome ICU patient anemia . Furthermore , suggest transfusion URC may deleterious hemostatic process bleed lesion , suggest restrictive transfusion may valuable patient gastrointestinal bleeding . Transfusion URC may also increase portal pressure may detrimental control acute portal hypertensive bleeding . The aim present study ass whether restrictive transfusion may improve outcome patient acute nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding , also whether restrictive strategy may improve outcome bleed episode related portal hypertension . The study carry prospective , randomize control design compare restrictive transfusion strategy usual nonrestrictive transfusional strategy . Overall 860 patient include ; 430 group . The main outcome measure survival . All death occur within 30 day admission , consider . Secondary outcome include rebleeding complication related treatment , related bleeding episode . Portal pressure measure assess influence transfusion strategy fluctuation parameter , relationship clinical course bleed episode . The study perform Bleeding Unit hospital period 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS At present time exist establish criterion decide necessary blood transfusion patient digestive hemorrhage , neither red cell concentrate ( RBC ) amount patient need . In clinical study make critical patient undergo by-pass coronary surgery , strategy restrictive transfusion show result similar one obtained liberal strategy , even improvement survival small rate complication relate transfusion . In animal model GI bleeding ( also human study traumatic hemorrhage ) , precocious vigorous transfusion make hemostasia difficult . Also increase rate rebleeding observe , suggest arterial hypotension combine hypovolemia aid hemostasia , stabilize clot . It lead diminish rebleeding rate . In way , patient portal hypertension associate hemorrhage , aggressive replacement volemia cause increase portal pressure , could lead condition big difficulty control hemorrhage great rate recidiva . On hand , potential complication associate transfusion would see potentially reduce . Our randomized prospective study try demonstrate use restrictive strategy sanguineous transfusion patient acute GI upper bleed least beneficial habitually use . Moreover , restrict transfusion patient could improve short term survival , well small rate transfusion-related rebleeding . In portal hypertension relate hemorrhage , restrict transfusion could avoid fluctuation portal pressure cause transfusion acute phase hemorrhage , could favor hemostasia patient . OBJECTIVES The main objective evaluate restrictive transfusion criterion patient acute upper GI hemorrhage maintain rate survival obtain use habitual transfusion criterion , even improve . The important secondary target consist evaluate restrictive transfusional parameter also accompany good control hemorrhage , also evaluate accompany small rate complication . Other additional objective would : - Effect change portal pressure correlation clinical evolution . - Hospital stay estimation economic cost . STUDY DESIGN Ours prospective , randomize control study , patient acute upper GI bleed randomize two group transfusional RBC treatment : Group 1 ( restrict transfusion ) , constitute train group : receive UCH transfusion hemoglobin descend 70 G/L , maintain value hemoglobin 70 90 G/L . Group 2 ( habitual transfusion ) , constitute group control : receive transfusion accord habitual practice , hemoglobin descend 90 G/L , maintain value hemoglobin 90 110 G/L . Randomization make mean close opaque envelope contain treatment option obtain mean list random number generate computer . The patient randomize soon inclusion criteria/exclusion verify . Randomization stratify accord origin hemorrhage ( related portal hypertension ) . NUMBER OF PREDICTED SUBJECTS AND JUSTIFICATION : 430 patient every group require ( 860 altogether ) , objective mortality reduction 5 % , global expect mortality secondary GI bleed control group 10 % , type I error 5 % type II error 20 % . 280 patient group require ( 560 altogether ) objective difference 6 % , detailed parameter . An expected period 3 year include</detailed_description>
