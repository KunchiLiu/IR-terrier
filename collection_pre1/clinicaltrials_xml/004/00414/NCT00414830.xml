	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis common disease characterize increase risk fracture . Furthermore recent study reveal patient fracture increase risk renew fracture . Most fracture elderly partly attributable osteoporosis . The severe show hip fracture ( HFx ) increase mortality decrease health relate quality life major impact level national health service . Solid evidence available show several intervention reduce risk osteoporotic fracture . In spite HFx patient offer examination treatment osteoporosis rare happen routine basis . In county Funen Ribe Denmark department Endocrinology Orthopedic Surgery Odense University Hospital Hospital South Western Jutland therefore initiate fracture discharge program part health technology assessment ( HTA ) study offer evaluation osteoporosis HFx patient . Evaluation consist Duel Energy X-ray Absorptiometry , Instant Vertebral Assessment , biochemical panel , clinical assessment follow specific anti-osteoporotic treatment appropriate . The HTA study design longitudinal cohort study patient admit participate department low energy HFx . Inclusion start January first 2005 end December 31 . 2006 . After last inclusion follow last patient set 2 year . In study period data collect subsequent fracture , epidemiological demographic factor , questionnaire quality life , register data mortality , use medication , use health service .
