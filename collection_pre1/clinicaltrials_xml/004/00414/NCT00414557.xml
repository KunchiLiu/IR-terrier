	<brief_title>Knee Malalignment Thigh Muscle Strengthening Individuals With Medial Knee Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although quadriceps strengthen cornerstone physiotherapy management , recent evidence suggest high quadriceps strength patient malaligned knee may increase OA progression . This study investigate effect quadriceps strengthen adduction moment patient medial knee OA without malalignment . 107 participant without varus knee malalignment recruit randomised exercise control group . Participants exercise group teach five quadriceps strengthen exercise project physiotherapist perform five day week twelve week home . The exercise : 1 . Quadriceps exercise fulcrum use ankle weight 2 . Straight leg raise exercise use ankle weight 3 . Long arc knee extension exercise sit use ankle weight 4 . Knee extension exercise isometric hold 60° knee flexion use ankle weight 5 . Knee extension exercise isometric hold 60° knee flexion use elastic band . Each exercise perform 2x10 repetition first 2 week 3x10 repetition thereafter . Participants visit physiotherapist 7 time Week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 10 . They give ankle weight elastic band bring home instruct repetition weight use physiotherapist , also check progressed exercise . The average duration physiotherapy session 30 minute . To monitor compliance , participant give exercise instruction sheet keep train diary record exercise do . The control group receive intervention .</detailed_description>
