	<detailed_description>Grass MATA MPL develop Allergy Therapeutics ( UK9 Ltd.to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy patient prove type I hypersensitivity cross react grass pollen cause rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis without mild moderate asthma bronchiale . Grass MATA MPL produce re-formulation Allergy Therapeutics product Pollinex Quattro , use Europe since 1999 'named patient ' basis ( approximately 65,000 treatment course contain grass pollen ) . Grass MATA MPL contain extract 13 grass pollen . This extract chemically modify glutaraldehyde produce active ingredient , allergoid . Such modification reduces reactivity extract IgE antibody . However , simultaneous reduction important immunological property , IgG T cell reactivity see . The modified extract adsorb L-tyrosine depot formulation . MPL® , purify , detoxify glycolipid derive cell wall Salmonella minnesota , also include current product formulation . This excipient/adjuvant include increase immunogenic effect product enhance switch allergen-specific TH2 TH1-like T cell profile . The current formulation design provide product efficacious 4 injection , contrast longer schedule currently use unmodified extract . The product also safer use formulation contain similar mass unmodified allergen extract regard ability cause severe local allergic reaction anaphylaxis , reduced reactivity IgE antibody . The modification great 75 % , small amount unmodified allergen remain product . The purpose study compare efficacy Grass MATA MPL versus placebo grass-allergic subject follow 4 subcutaneous injection study medication administer start 2007 grass pollen season .</detailed_description>
