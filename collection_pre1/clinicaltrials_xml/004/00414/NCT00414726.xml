	<brief_title>Normobaric Oxygen Therapy Acute Ischemic Stroke Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death lead cause disability United States . Ischemic stroke cause blockage blood flow one brain artery , usually due blood clot . As result reduce supply oxygen nutrient lead permanent brain damage . Normobaric oxygen therapy ( NBO , high-flow oxygen deliver via facemask ) show promise simple , widely accessible , low-cost therapy prevent stroke-related brain damage extend time window administer clot-busting drug t-PA ( tissue plasminogen activator ) , acute stroke treatment approve Food Drug Administration . The primary goal trial compare safety therapeutic efficacy NBO ( start within 9 hour symptom onset ) standard medical treatment Room Air . We aim enroll total 240 individual acute ischemic stroke le 9 hour symptom onset , Massachusetts General Brigham Women 's Hospitals Boston . Participants randomly select receive either room air ( RA , control ) NBO ( active treatment ) flow rate 30-45L/min administered via face mask 8 hour . Neurological function score neuroimaging [ magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan ] obtain , , therapy 90 day . This study part Specialized Program Translational Research Acute Stroke ( SPOTRIAS ) , allow researcher enhance initiate translational research ultimately benefit individual stroke .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age great equal 18 year . Acute ischemic stroke treatment potentially start within 9 hour symptom onset . If symptom onset time unknown , time onset define midpoint time subject last see neurologically intact , find neurological deficit . National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score 4 great . Patients actively consider intravenous intraarterial thrombolysis exclude . Patients likely acute stroke intervention carotid endarterectomy stent angioplasty , hemicraniectomy , etc . Rapidly improve neurological deficit ( transient ischemic attack ) . Known history severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( Forced Expiratory Vital Capacity le 1.0 oxygen dependent ) . More 3 L/min oxygen require maintain peripheral arterial oxygen saturation 92 % . New York Heart Association Class III heart failure . Endotracheal intubation prior enrollment impend need artificial ventilation . Coma ( National Institutes Health Stroke Scale item 1a score 3 ) . Suspected seizure onset stroke , know active seizure disorder . Blood glucose 50 mg/dL great 250 mg/dL prior enrollment . Concurrent severe nonstroke medical illness require admission nonneurological intensive care unit Expected survival le 90 day . Any condition might limit neurological assessment followup opinion investigator . Premenopausal woman positive pregnancy blood test perform admission . Inability obtain consent patient legally authorize representative . Active participation another intervention study ( e.g . investigational drug trial ) . Proven alternate etiology strokelike symptom .</criteria>
