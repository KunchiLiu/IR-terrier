	<brief_summary>The overarching aim STILL assessment IV LEV management seizure ED set . The main study endpoint consider two patient group interest ( SE non-SE ) : - For non-SE patient , STILL compare IV LEV vs. current standard-care placebo , respect follow question : - Does IV LEV administration result lower seizure duration and/or recurrence rate administration placebo ? ( Ho : No difference seizure duration recurrence rate two group . ) - Is IV LEV associate different rate significant side effect placebo ? ( Ho : No difference significant side effect rate two group . ) - For SE patient , STILL compare [ IV LEV + lorazepam 2mg ] vs. [ lorazepam 3 mg ] , respect follow question : - Does addition IV LEV BZD allow BZD-sparing effect ( i.e . achievement seizure control lower dose BZD ) ? ( Ho : No difference seizure duration and/or recurrence rate two group . ) - Is IV LEV + lower-dose BZD associate different rate significant side effect higher-dose BZD administer monotherapy ? ( Ho : No difference significant side effect rate two group . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study enroll adult ( age least 18 year ) EDs MGH BWH . Patients classify , depend upon clinical presentation , SE group non-SE group . The total enrollment project non-SE patient 150 ; total enrollment project SE patient 200 . It expect least 3 year may require enroll requisite number patient . Patients eligible study enrollment seizure , know pregnancy renal failure , know breastfeeding . Hypotension exclusion criterion study . There contraindication study enrollment . Patients evaluate MGH/BWH EDs seizure may arrive private vehicle ambulance . A `` STILL '' pager activate ED physician upon notification impend ambulance arrival suspect seizure patient ( SE non-SE ) ; pager also activate patient arrival ED ambulance private vehicle . Upon patient arrival ED , standard stabilization provide . If patient determined seizure , patient currently seize , IV place ( already present ) line standard ED care . For patient eligible STILL , seizure must occur within hour ED arrival . Care provider make determination whether patient eligible , use checklist readily available ED . For patient determine eligible , care provider indicate whether patient `` SE '' `` non-SE '' arm - study group hereafter denote SE non-SE . STILL medication store ED medication , readily available care provider . The STILL medication separate section automate drug dispenser unit ED . STILL medication subdivide whether patient SE non-SE arm . In two subsection ( SE non-SE ) EDs ' automate drug dispenser one box study medication . Thus , ED always hand , sufficient study medication enroll one patient either SE non-SE arm . The randomization procedures determine content study medication box do Research Pharmacy , randomization need occur prior treatment ED . The study box unique identifier number , report back Research Pharmacy study medication administer ; Research Pharmacy thus track study patient receive study box ( medication regimen ) . This approach patient allocation drug dispense track consistent current mechanism enrol patient Partners IRB-approved study MGH/BWH EDs . Inside SE partition ED box syringe contain lorazepam ( concentration : 2 mg/mL ) either 2 mg 3 mg dose ; extra volume inactive diluent add 2 mg dose volume ( 1.5 mL ) syringe . In manner consistent previous/ongoing Partners IRB-approved study ED , syringe label `` lorazepam - 2mg 3mg . '' Also SE compartment drug dispenser infusion set label `` levetiracetam 1.5g placebo . '' Thus , SE patient , care provider administer two agent medication dispenser ; patient receive either [ lorazepam 2mg + levetiracetam 1.5 g ] [ lorazepam 3mg + placebo ] . Care provider instruct ( information include study drug ) administer lorazepam 1.5-2 minute ( line standard recommendation lorazepam administer rate exceed 2 mg/min ) .28 , 38 The infusion ( i.e . levetiracetam placebo ) administer 5 minute . Inside non-SE partition ED box infusion set label `` levetiracetam 1.5g placebo . '' Thus , non-SE patient , care provider administer one agent medication dispenser ; patient receive either levetiracetam 1.5 g placebo . Care provider instruct ( information include study drug ) administer infusion 5 minute . The content partition ED drug dispenser determine advance , randomization scheme prevents need care provider make phone call otherwise spend time ( ) randomize patient . When EDs use study drug either arm STILL , contact Research Pharmacy replace use material note patient 's medical record number along true identity study agent ( ) administer . Any adjunctive medication may administer discretion treat physician . Study endpoints SE non-SE patient outline Detailed Protocol . Briefly , SE analysis focus whether seizure recurrence reduce , whether respiratory depression post-medication vital sign change occur less frequently patient receive LEV small dose lorazepam , compare receive higher-dose lorazepam alone . For non-SE patient , endpoint include seizure recurrence well quality examination occurrence side effect .</detailed_description>
