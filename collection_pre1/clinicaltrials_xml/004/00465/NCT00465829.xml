LABS-2 include clinical assessment detailed interview questionnaires pre-operatively several post-operative time point ( 30 day , 6 month , 12 month follow surgery , annually thereafter ) ass risk surgery , change clinical , metabolic , psychosocial characteristic patient , health care utilization follow bariatric surgery . Detailed data surgical procedure peri- post-operative care also collect determine component surgical procedure , peri-operative post-operative care well clinical/demographic patient characteristic associate post-operative risk change patient status . Patients enrol LABS-2 provide blood specimens pre-operatively post-operatively address LABS-2 hypotheses additional sample store NIDDK tissue repository serologic , pathologic genomic testing hypothesis .</detailed_description>
