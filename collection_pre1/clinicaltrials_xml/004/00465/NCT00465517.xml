	<brief_summary>The study evaluate effectiveness safety investigational drug-ganaxolone - partial seizure frequency adult epilepsy take maximum 3 antiepileptic medication ( AEDs ) . The study also evaluate effectiveness ganaxolone females catamenial epilepsy . Catamenial epilepsy refers relationship seizure frequency woman 's menstrual cycle , number seizure increase around time woman 's menstrual cycle .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis epilepsy POS without secondary generalized seizures accord International League Against Epilepsy [ ILAE ] Classification Epileptic Seizures ( 1981 ) . Diagnosis establish clinical history CT MRI brain rule progressive structural lesion EEG result consistent partialonset epilepsy . During 8 week baseline period precede randomization visit ( Visit 4 ) , subject document seizure frequency ≥ 3CPS per 4 week average . Subjects seizure free 28 consecutive day treatment stable dose AEDs [ Note : Subjects historically sufficiently high seizure frequency fall short 1 seizure 4 week period seizurefree period &gt; 28 consecutive day may allow enter study discussion Medical Monitor . Prolongation screen period questionable case may also allow Medical Monitor . ] Treatment stable dose 3 ( FDA approve ) current AEDs 1 month prior screen . Maintenance current AEDs without change dose duration study . Concomitant vigabatrin permit ; Felbamate allow subject felbamate least 18 month stable laboratory test ) course study . [ Note : A short period stable laboratory result may allow Medical Monitor , depend extent dose change halflife AED . ] Subjects receive treatment vagal nerve stimulator ( VNS ) may include long VNS place least 12 month prior entry study , VNS battery due replacement 0600 subject participation , stimulation parameter keep constant 1 month prior screen . VNS count 1 3 concomitant AEDs . Male female , 18 69 year age ( inclusive ) . [ Note : Subjects &gt; 69 year age good health condition may allow enter study discussion approval Medical Monitor . ] A 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) w/o clinically significant abnormality . Be properly inform nature risk study give informed consent writing , prior enter study . Able participate full term study . Able keep seizure &amp; medication diary throughout course study . Sexually active woman childbearing potential ( WCBP ) must use medically acceptable method birth control negative qualitative βhuman chorionic growth hormone ( βHCG ) pregnancy test result urine sample collect initial screen visit . A woman childbearing potential define female biologically capable become pregnant . A medically acceptable method birth control include intrauterine device place least 3 month , surgical sterilization , adequate barrier method ( e.g. , diaphragm foam ) . An oral contraceptive alone consider adequate purpose study . Use oral contraceptive combination another method ( eg , spermicidal cream ) acceptable.in subject sexually active , abstinence acceptable form birth control serum βHCG must test per protocol . Subjects history depression stable dmay take 1 antidepressant medication . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Presence nonmotor simple partial seizure . History pseudoseizures last 5 year . History primary generalize seizure last 5 year . Past use vigabatrin without stable visual field test twice 12 month last dose vigabatrin ( Concomitant use vigabatrin allow ) .

[ Note : Subjects suffer psychosis well explain exogenous factor may allow enter study discussion approval Medical Monitor . ] Current use neuroleptic psychosis . A significant medical surgical condition screen might compromise hematologic , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic system condition would place subject increase risk . Known sensitivity allergy progesterone relate steroid compound . History drug use alcohol abuse within past 5 year .

Exposure investigational drug device within 30 day prior screen . Alanine transferase ( ALT ; SGPT ) Aspartate transferase ( AST ; SGOT ) level &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) screening . Benzodiazepines may use intermittently control seizure cluster one time rescue maximum 4 occasion follow : Subjects need benzodiazepine control seizure per month 4 time total Titration Maintenance Phases discontinue . Once Titration Phase No per month Maintenance Phase Each occasion may period 24 hour , 3 dos benzodiazepine may use . If subject take benzodiazepine chronically epilepsy nonepilepsy condition , count 1 3 AEDs dose change study . Subject history repetitive seizure within 12month period precede study entry individual seizure count . Inability withhold grapefruit grapefruit juice diet entire clinical trial .</criteria>
