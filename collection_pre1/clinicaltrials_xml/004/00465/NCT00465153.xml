	<brief_summary>Loss muscle mass functional ability major concern old individual . Aging associate increased inflammation cause release hormone-like compound term `` cytokine '' involve muscle protein degradation . Diets rich ω-3 fatty acid decrease production pro-inflammatory cytokine , possibly inhibit production lipid involve cytokine synthesis . Our purpose assess effect dietary supplementation ω-3 fatty acid , α-linolenic acid ( ALA ) commonly find flaxseed , combine resistance train pro-inflammatory cytokine , strength , muscle mass old adult . Progressive resistance training consider standard increase strength muscle mass old adult . We hypothesize combine two intervention improve strength muscle mass resistance train alone modulate inflammatory process associate age . Our propose research compare old individual supplement ALA placebo resistance training program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Combined Effects Resistance Training Flax Oil Supplementation Upon Inflammation Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim determine effect progressive resistance train α-linolenic acid supplementation decrease marker inflammation improve muscle mass strength old adult . This do comparing older adult participate resistance train program supplementing diet either α-linolenic acid placebo . The hypothesis research : Resistance training combine α-linolenic acid supplementation decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , increase strength muscle mass resistance training placebo supplementation old individual . Sixty untrained male females 60 year age recruit newspaper ad . Subjects match sex age randomly assign supplement 15 g/day α-linolenic acid ( ALA ) flaxseed oil placebo ( corn oil ) participate resistance training , 3 time per week 12 week . The 15 g dose choose effective reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine healthy adult 4 week ( Caughey et al. , 1996 ) . Twelve week resistance training choose effective increase muscle mass strength old adult ( Chrusch et al. , 2001 ) . Our sample size 30 subject per group sufficient detect expect change cytokine ( Caughey et al. , 1996 ) power 80 % alpha level 0.05 . The primary dependent variable pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 TNF-α . Secondary dependent variable chest press leg press strength , lean tissue mass , muscle thickness . A 2 ( group ) x 2 ( time , baseline 12 week ) ANOVA repeat measure 2nd factor , use analysis alpha level 0.05 . Methodology : Exercise Training : The exercise training consist progressive resistance training program design increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy participant complete 12 different machine-based resistance exercise . The exercise include : chest press , shoulder press , lat pulldown , bicep curl , triceps extension , leg press , knee flexion , knee extension , hip flexion/extension , hip abduction/adduction . The subject complete 3-4 set 6-12 repetition intensity 65-80 % 1 repetition maximum progressively overloaded fashion . Biochemical Measures : Assessment marker inflammation do biochemical blood analysis baseline 12 week supplementation combine resistance training . Blood drawn overnight night fast morning account change due diurnal variation . Approximately 10 mL blood drawn antecubital vein arm . Serum assess pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor-alpha use ELISA . Fitness Testing : One repetition maximum ( RM ) strength test do use chest press leg press baseline 12 week . Subjects complete standardize warm-up cycling stretch strength test . The test protocol allow subject become familiar movement pattern resistance training machine initiate strength test trial . Subjects gradually progress maximal load lift chest press leg press . Once subject unable complete full repetition , last successful attempt record 1RM . Body Composition : Lean tissue fat mass assess dual energy X-ray absorptiometry , muscle thickness extensor flexor elbow knee determine ultrasound baseline 12 week .</detailed_description>
