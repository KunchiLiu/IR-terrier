	<brief_summary>Healthy child may develop symptom chronic sinusitis chronic cough , chronic runny nose , nasal congestion , even headache . Such symptom may persist long child get symptom cold commonly result prescription oral antibiotic . The purpose study evaluate whether use saline alone saline plus antibiotic ( gentamycin ) irrigate nose directly day 6 week effective safe treatment name symptom . Computerized axial tomography ( CAT ) scan quality life survey use compare health sinus treatment , score determine two treatment , saline alone saline gentamycin , effective treatment condition . The study hypothesis intranasal saline irrigation work well saline plus gentamycin , majority patient experience significant improvement 6 week treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Use Saline Saline Plus Gentamycin Nasal Irrigation Treat Chronic Sinusitis Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pediatric population , rhinosinusitis common concern result frequently frequent unsuccessful prescription systemic oral antibiotic therapy . Children typically experience estimate 6-8 upper respiratory illness per year , usually viral , 13 % estimate result true sinusitis . True chronic sinusitis , adequately treat , may result long term symptom include nasal airway obstruction , nasal congestion , persistent mucopurulent rhinorrhea , daytime nocturnal cough , headache , daytime fatigue , even exacerbation poor control underlie asthma . A child 's quality life severely impacted caretaker 's due day miss school , frequency doctor visit course oral antibiotic therapy prescribe mention symptom , ultimately result development resistant organism addition potential negative side effect associate systemic oral antibiotic use . Intranasal saline irrigation underutilized pediatric population , likely due presumption child cooperate tolerate act irrigation . Saline irrigation nose inexpensive generally well tolerated treatment little side effect risk . Rigorous data regard efficacy saline irrigation become available past decade , study demonstrate clear improvement patient quality life measure various study instrument outcome survey . In protocol , patient randomize receive either saline alone saline plus gentamycin solution form nasal irrigation daily six week treatment period . Weekly phone call make check possible adverse event patient treatment , end treatment period another CAT scan perform assess status sinus . Overall improvement determine base sinus status second CAT scan well quality life survey fill parent .</detailed_description>
