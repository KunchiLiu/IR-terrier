	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease lysosomal storage disorder result deficiency key enzyme b-glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) . This enzyme responsible break specialized type fat molecule , know glucocerebroside , lysosome . The enzyme deficiency cause genetic mutation result production misfolded GCase protein . The absent defective GCase enzyme activity lead build-up glucocerebroside inside certain cell . Over time , Gaucher cell accumulate may cause inflammation damage specific area within body , include liver , spleen , bone marrow , lung , central nervous system . AT2101 design act pharmacological chaperone selectively bind misfolded GCase . After bind enzyme , think AT2101 promote proper fold , processing , traffic enzyme endoplasmic reticulum final destination , lysosome , area cell enzyme work . Once reach lysosome , pharmacological chaperone displace enzyme perform normal function , breakdown natural substrate , glucocerebroside . Several vitro vivo preclinical study conduct . In study AT2101 increase GCase enzyme level cell derive Gaucher disease patient different genetic mutation , include cell genetic mutation associate neurologic form Gaucher disease . In normal mouse , oral administration AT2101 result dose-dependent increase GCase level liver , spleen , brain , lung . This study design evaluate ex vivo response pharmacological chaperone therapy test blood sample previously treat untreated patient Gaucher disease . The study include patient non-neuropathic Gaucher disease ( type I ) neuropathic Gaucher disease ( type II and/or III ) . Up 50 patient enrol NIH . All subject participate one study visit . Clinical information collect retrospectively medical record . Information collect include Gaucher disease diagnosis history , medical history , family history , assessment clinical severity , genotype . A blood sample collect various cell isolated laboratory test research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Characterize Effect Pharmacological Chemicals Blood From Patients With Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease ( GD ) rare lysosomal storage disorder cause mutation gene encode acid-Beta-glucosidase ( Beta-glucocerebrosidase [ GCase ] ) ( Gba ) , lysosomal enzyme catalyze breakdown lipid glucosylceramide ( glucosylcerebroside [ GlcCer ] ) . The resulting deficiency GCase activity lead intracellular accumulation substrate GlcCer , primarily macrophage cell . These lipid-laden macrophage , know Gaucher cell , hallmark disease accumulation liver , bone marrow , spleen elicits clinical symptom associate GD . Pharmacological chaperone therapy novel approach treat disease due protein misfolding/mistrafficking use small molecule ligands rescue increase residual function mutant protein . For lysosomal storage disease causative mutant enzyme residual activity , reversible inhibitor act pharmacological chaperone specifically bind , stabilize , facilitate proper fold traffic mutant enzyme lysosome , thereby increase ability degrade accumulate substrate . AT2101 ( isofagomine [ IFG ] tartrate ) iminosugar function selective pharmacological chaperone GCase le stably fold result missense mutation . Current data suggest AT2101 may work stabilize mutant GCase endoplasmic reticulum promote traffic enzyme lysosome . In lysosome , pharmacological chaperone displace , enzyme perform normal function , breakdown glucocerebroside . This study design primarily evaluate characterize effect AT2101 ( GCase ) activity marker disease lymphoblast macrophage cell line derive patient GD . Fifty subject confirm diagnosis GD know Gba genotype enrol trial . The study consist one study visit . Clinical information collect retrospectively . Collected information include limit GD diagnosis , medical history , family history , assessment clinical severity genotype . Blood sample series ex vivo assay collect . Blood cell line derive subject ' blood sample use ex vivo assay , conduct central laboratory .</detailed_description>
