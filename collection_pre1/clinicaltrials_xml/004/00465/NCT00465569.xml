	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , clinical trial involve child age 6 21 year persistent cow 's milk allergy . These child recruit 2 site ( Johns Hopkins Duke University ) undergo initial screen double-blind , placebo-controlled , food challenge ( DBPCFC ) confirm threshold dose reactivity milk . Patients treat milk oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) placebo 22-30 week . Those reach adequate maintenance dose OIT undergo second DBPCFC . Those develop desensitization continue daily milk intake undergo third DBPCFC . Those treatment group desensitize return strict avoidance . Those placebo group offer begin treatment continue strict milk avoidance . Symptom diet information collect initially regular interval . Bloodwork , skin prick test ( SPTs ) , pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) , oral secretion sample do initially periodic interval .</detailed_description>
