	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate usefulness perform `` cat scan '' heart arteries patient ( without know history heart disease ) see physician chest pain . We plan evaluate test patient already undergone stress test . On occasion , stress test result equivocal suspected inaccurate . In case , depend overall clinical suspicion coronary artery disease , physician may recommend cardiac catheterization determine whether patient blockage heart 's artery . We plan evaluate whether Cat Scan heart artery provide physician important information assist decision . If result test normal , patient may require heart catheterization ; alternatively , test abnormal , physician may proceed catheterization review data . There 200 patient enrol study . All patient follow usual cardiologist , decision make cardiologist . Computed tomography ( CT ; `` cat scan '' ) x-ray test routinely use diagnostic purpose . Cardiac compute tomography use new generation multislice CT ( MSCT ) scanner improve way use CT scan technique look heart blood vessel body . The image coronary artery obtain MSCT scanner ( 5-10 minute procedure ) highly accurate , compare conventional invasive cardiac catheterization procedure . This procedure provide calculation coronary artery calcium score well accurate depiction coronary anatomy . The accuracy test similar achieve traditional stress test imaging , inherent advantage traditional stress test . Therefore , believe patient intermediate , inconclusive , suspected inaccurate stress test , MSCT coronary artery may provide helpful information physician help guide decision regard need ( lack ) possible invasive cardiac catheterization . This procedure consider ideal `` screening test '' exclude presence coronary artery disease patient suspect coronary artery disease . On day procedure , patient give intravenous ( `` IV dye '' ) contrast Cat Scan . We also draw blood sample assess kidney function and/or pregnancy status ( necessary ) . The contrast create picture one 's artery . The intravenous contrast use dye use routine cat scan part body , well cardiac catheterization . Prior Scan patient may prescribe medicine call beta blocker The beta blocker typically use call Atenolol . This medication slow heart rate one commonly use treat high blood pressure . Dosing base upon current medication vital sign . If patient 's heart rate great 60 beat per minute intravenous beta-blocker may give optimize heart image . Patient 's hold breath twice , 30 second time . The imaging part test take 10 minute . Patient 's observed test 20 minute , follow discharge home . Physicians call patient 's result study , contact patient 's regard result , well `` next step . '' If patient diabetic ( take metformin/glucophage ) , request follow ( next day ) kidney test . Patient 's also call 3 month ask brief question regard health ( recent hospitalization , new medical illness , follow heart testing , etc . )</brief_summary>
