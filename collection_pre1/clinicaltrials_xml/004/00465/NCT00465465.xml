	<brief_summary>The dose recombinant MVA use TB trial date relatively low compare trial use recombinant MVAs use 2.5 x 108pfu ( A Hill , personal communication ) . Having demonstrate safety immunogenicity 5 x 107pfu MVA85A , need perform dose optimization study , prior commence large scale Phase II III study South Africa . We vaccinate 12 volunteer dose half log lower dose currently use , i.e . 107pfu MVA85A , 12 volunteer dose half log high , i.e . 108pfu .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study 2 Doses New TB Vaccine , MVA85A , Healthy Volunteers Previously Vaccinated With BCG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MVA85A ( dose 5 x 107pfu ) administer 41 healthy volunteer UK 17 healthy volunteer The Gambia , serious adverse event . We design Phase I study allow vaccination volunteer group sequentially step-wise increase mycobacterial exposure , order minimize possibility Koch reaction . A Koch reaction describes development immunopathology person animal tuberculosis , exaggerate immune response M.tb stimulate . It describe patient TB disease Koch perform original study employ mycobacteria type therapeutic vaccination . It demonstrate mouse model therapeutic vaccination ( Taylor , 2003 ) . Available animal data suggest reaction occur mice latently infect M.tb , suggest reaction may correlate high bacterial load Koch phenomenon may pose problem vaccination healthy albeit latently infect human . We start study healthy volunteer mycobacterially na√Øve possible . They skin test negative Elispot negative PPD , ESAT 6 CFP10 , previously vaccinate BCG . We complete study UK vaccinate volunteer previously vaccinate BCG ( McShane , 2004 ) . These volunteer exclude Mantoux test great 15 millimeter . These study ongoing The Gambia . The group currently recruit increase mycobacterial spectrum healthy volunteer latently infect M.tb . Decision matrix select MVA85A dose 1 . If reduce dose MVA85A result reduce immunogenicity , could use either 5x107 108 dose , would select low ground safety . 2 . If increase dose MVA85A increase incidence side-effects , could use either 5x107 107 dose , would use high ground immunogenicity . 3 . If increase dose MVA85A result increase immunogenicity increase side-effects , could use either 5x107 108 dose subsequent trial 4 . If reduce dose MVA85A result reduction immunogenicity could use either 107 5x107 dose subsequent trial 5 . If three dos equally safe immunogenic use either low 5x107 dose .</detailed_description>
