	<brief_summary>The main goal GENEPARK consortium employ innovative haemogenomic approach determine gene expression profile specific genetic idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient . These gene expression signature utilise clinically non-invasive diagnostic test PD . The sensitivity newly develop diagnostic test determine extensive validation independent cohort PD patient , whereas specificity assess test patient atypical parkinsonism , include multiple system atrophy , progressive supranuclear palsy diffuse Lewy body disease . In order test specificity diagnostic set disorder affect basal ganglion , Huntington 's disease dopa responsive dystonia patient analyse . The second objective proposal determine correlation gene expression signatures different stage PD thus provide basis early diagnosis monitoring disease progression . These change blood gene expression correlate alteration detect neuroimaging brain PD patient . Such combination molecular morphological marker disease may ultimately facilitate selection monitor neuroprotective therapy PD . Finally , GENEPARK aim develop new bioinformatic software tool selection genomic biomarkers use microarray data . A set establish computational tool apply novel method , base mechanistic model neurodegenerative disease , develop order study advantage limitation different methodology .

	<detailed_description>Employ innovative haemogenomic approach determine gene expression signature specific idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . There currently specific clinical laboratory diagnostic test available PD . In GENEPARK , blood sample patient genetic PD idiopathic PD analyse microarrays identify gene expression signature specific PD . The specificity new biomarkers PD test analysis patient atypical parkinsonism , include multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) diffuse Lewy body disease ( DLBD ) , well patient basal ganglia disorder Huntington 's disease ( HD ) dopa responsive dystonia ( DRD ) . The validated gene expression signature utilise develop new test diagnosis idiopathic PD . Determine correlation gene expression signatures different stage PD . Gene expression presymptomatic symptomatic patient genetic form PD well patient various stage idiopathic PD analyse identify gene expression signature specific various stage disease . It emphasise since clinical measure present presymptomatic genetic PD molecular marker could serve surrogate marker monitor therapeutic efficacy possible preventive treatment PD . Determine correlation gene expression signatures morphological evidence neurodegenerative process PD brain determine neuroimaging . Gene expression signature identify blood sample correlate change brain detect neuroimaging PD patient . Such correlation molecular morphological marker disease facilitate selection blood marker relation disease progression . Moreover , molecular morphological marker disease progression could utilised combination monitoring effect new neuroprotective therapy PD . Develop standardise approach development validation haemogenomic biomarkers . This objective achieve special emphasis careful clinical selection patient , sufficient power regard patient number , well extensive quality control validation data . Develop new bioinformatic software tool selection genomic biomarkers use microarray data . The aim GENEPARK develop theoretical foundation build software tool sample classification selection genomic biomarkers use microarray data . The established computational tool novel method develop within GENEPARK apply patient data study advantage limitation different methodology .</detailed_description>
