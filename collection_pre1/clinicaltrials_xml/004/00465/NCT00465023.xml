	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine high dos radiation use proton beam give safely low acceptable side effect . We also gather information determine ability proton beam destroy cancer cell liver . There two type external radiation treatment ( proton beam photon beam ) . Proton beam radiation accurate kind treatment show affect less normal tissue regular radiation beam . The accuracy allow u safely increase amount radiation deliver eliminate cancer may potentially reduce side effect normally experienced standard radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants receive treatment outpatient Northeast Proton Treatment Center locate Massachusetts General Hospital . - Since look high dose proton beam radiation give people safely , everyone participates study receive amount radiation . Small group people enrol give certain dose radiation . If tolerate well , next small group people enrol receive high dose . This continue find high dose give without cause serious unmanageable side effect . - Radiation treatment liver give day , 5 day week ( Monday-Friday ) , 3 week . Each treatment take 10-20 minute . - A physical examination , medical history , blood test take week 3 week radiation therapy . Follow-up visit occur every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
