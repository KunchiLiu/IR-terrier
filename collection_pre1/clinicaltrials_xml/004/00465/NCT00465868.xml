	<detailed_description>Introduction . Cardiovascular disease responsible 30 % worldwide mortality , account approximately 15 million death per year . Improvement medical treatment strategy last decade produce tremendous decrease mortality connection acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . Since 1960 's , short-term mortality ( 30 day ) decrease approximately 30 % current mortality rate 6,5 % . The success modern treatment AMI , however , lead increase number patient survive AMI , thus create grow group high-risk patient need treatment care . The development heart failure risk recurrent ischemia reinfarction two main threat population . To improve treatment outcomes high risk population , early risk stratification base thorough understand operate mechanism behind transition acute infarction heart failure necessary . AMI , reperfusion microvascular obstruction . Reperfusion therapy one major success treatment AMI , numerous study support idea opening occlude coronary artery , especially context AMI . However , even presence patent infarct related artery , may still inadequate reperfusion tissue level . This phenomenon , know no-reflow , may preclude optimal reperfusion microvascular obstruction . It estimate microvascular obstruction occur 30-40 % revascularised patient spite patent artery ; exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism partially unknown . Microvascular obstruction may possibly due sequestration neutrophil microvasculature subsequently lead microvascular occlusion erythrocyte , leucocytes cellular debris . It remain unclear whether stimulus development microvascular obstruction originate coronary occlusion exclusively reperfusion play active role progression phenomenon . Microvascular obstruction heart failure . The presence microvascular obstruction follow AMI , predict unfavourable postinfarction prognosis development leave ventricular dysfunction leave ventricular remodelling . Left ventricular remodelling associate development heart failure directly relate magnitude microvascular obstruction early experimental clinical AMI1 , well 6 month acute event . The mechanisms microvascular obstruction induces ventricular remodelling remain unknown . Possibilities include potentiation wall thin infarct expansion early infarction , well potential impairment infarct healing , give association presence microvascular obstruction great transmural scar formation 6 month AMI . Assessment microvascular obstruction . Until recently , microvascular obstruction could assess method radioactive micro-spheres histopathological technique , could perform terminal phase experimental study , clinically . However , recent advance field non-invasive cardiac imaging enable serial assessment phenomenon cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) , thereby facilitate much great understand pathophysiological prognostic significance . Assessment leave ventricular remodelling CMR . The pathologic change associate development heart failure include change geometry function , myocytes extracellular matrix . Assessment leave ventricular remodelling include estimation leave ventricular size shape , leave ventricular mass functional assessment include estimation ejection fraction . Biochemical marker scar formation , inflammation LV dysfunction . Prognosis MI relate extent myocardial cell-loss quality quantity repair infarcted myocardium . The fate fibrous tissue follow acute myocardial infarction , include regression , persistence progression fibrosis important understand underlying mechanism behind progressive nature LV remodelling follow AMI . Non-invasive assessment fibrous tissue formation may accomplish measure serum marker collagen turnover . Following AMI , fibrillar collagen appear infarct scar remote site myocardial infarction , include viable tissue infarcted noninfarcted ventricle . In rat , procollagen mRNA collagens type I III increase right ventricle day 2 onwards transmural leave ventricular MI . The increase collagen turnover may last several month even year . Aminoterminal propeptide type I procollagen ( PINP ) aminoterminal propeptide type III procollagen ( PIIINP ) liberate collagen biosynthesis , may use marker process . PIIINP reflect turnover soft tissue collagen elevate AMI , reach plateau four day large increase patient large infarction acutely reduce LV function . Increased serum PIIINP measure subacute phase myocardial infarction associate persistently depress LV ejection fraction , dilatation restrictive diastolic filling . Patency infarct related artery reduces PIIINP response scar formation . The role type I collagen follow AMI less clear . It suggest late rise synthesis type I collagen myocardial infarction , remain show . Among patient heart failure mixed aetiology ( ischemic non-ischemic ) , increased level CIPT , PINP PIIINP associate increase risk death . The modulation collagen deposition scar formation accomplish intricate interplay neurohormone ( eg . aldosterone , angiotensin I II , bradykinins , catecholamine natriuretic peptide ) inflammatory system . The relationship CMR , collagen marker neurohormone know set . Study aim . To characterize disease progression elucidate operative pathophysiological mechanism patient evidence microvascular obstruction contrast enhance CMR follow acute AMI . Study plan . This single centre observational study , design assess difference patient without CMR evidence microvascular obstruction . To assure homogenous group patient , successfully revascularised patient AMI cause single proximal/mid LAD , CX RCA occlusion assess coronary angiography , include . Only patient functionally single vessel disease without former heart disease include . Patients select screen request participate follow acute PCI . The first CMR perform 48±12 hour follow primary PCI . A follow-up CMR perform one week , two month one year follow index PCI . At every CMR examination ( include screen phase ) , blood sample collect , clinical examination echocardiography perform . The study population manage AMI accord current optimal guideline , patient consider medical therapy , include ACE inhibitor beta-blockers . The study evaluate presence microvascular obstruction baseline vs. change time CMR data biochemical marker collagen turnover , neurohormonal activity inflammation . Sample size estimation . To detect difference LV mass 10g power 80 % p = 0,05 , necessary include 14 patient . To show difference ejection fraction 5 % power 90 % p = 0,05 , sufficient include 5 patient . In study Wu coworkers , late enhancement CMR demonstrate significant difference clinical outcome follow myocardial infarction 38 patient ( without congestive heart failure ) divide three group accord size infarction . To account dropout biological variation include minimum 20 patient microvascular obstruction . It estimate microvascular obstruction persist around 30-40 % patient undergoing revascularisation . The group patient without microvascular obstruction consequently 40 patient , generate total study population 60 patient .</detailed_description>
