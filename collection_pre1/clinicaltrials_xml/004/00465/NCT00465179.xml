	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Patients With Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sunitinib malate design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel essential growth cancer . If find eligible take part study , take sunitinib malate day ( either without food ) 4 week row follow 2 week rest study drug . These 6 week consider 1 cycle study treatment . Around Day 15 cycle , vital sign measure record , blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test . These evaluation do local doctor 's office . You require return clinic follow-up visit around Day 29 Cycle 1 . At visit , medical history record , ability perform daily activity evaluate . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You ask side effect may experience since last visit . You ask medicine may currently take . You blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) routine test . Beginning Day 1 Cycle 3 , return clinic every 12 week ( Day 1 cycle ) . You evaluations Day 29 visit . On Day 1 every cycle , ECG doppler echocardiogram multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan evaluate heart health . You follow-up image scan ( CT and/or MRI ) track response treatment Day 1 first 2 cycle every 12 week thereafter long receive treatment study . You continue receive treatment study , unless disease get bad , develop illness prevents continue treatment , experience intolerable side effect study drug . You remove study circumstance occur . This investigational study . Sunitinib malate authorize FDA treatment clear cell renal carcinoma . Its use non-clear cell renal carcinoma experimental . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm advanced nonclear cell one follow subtypes : papillary , chromophobe , collect duct carcinoma ( CDC ) , renal medullary carcinoma ( RMC ) , unclassified . Patients conventionaltype renal cell carcinoma &gt; /= 20 % sarcomatoid component primary tumor eligible . Patients sarcomatoid feature fineneedle aspiration ( FNA ) core biopsy metastatic site eligible . 2 . Patients must measurable disease . 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . 4 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function within 14 day prior study entry define : Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9 g/dl , absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 1,500/microliter ( microL ) , platelets &gt; /= 100,000/microL , total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 mg/dl , AST ( SGOT ) and/or ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 X institutional uln , except know hepatic metastasis , wherein may &lt; /= 5 x uln , serum creatinine &lt; /= 4 X uln ( long patient require dialysis ) . 5 . Patients must recover effect surgery . 6 . Female patient childbearing potential ( postmenopausal least 12 month surgically sterile ) must normal plasma beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( betaHCG ) within 24 hour prior enrol study . 7 . Patients child father childbearing potential must agree practice form medically acceptable birth control study ( barrier method , hormonal method , etc. ) . 8 . Patients must give write informed consent prior initiation therapy , keep policy institution . Patients history major psychiatric illness must judge ( treat physician ) able fully understand investigational nature study risk associate therapy . 9 . Patients brain metastasis may participate trial . 10 . Patients two prior systemic therapy eligible participate trial prior MultiTyrosine Kinase Inhibitors sorafenib sunitinib malate . 1 . No prior malignancy allow , except nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma site , cancer patient adequately treated disease free 2 year . 2 . Pregnant lactate woman exclude . 3 . Patients must schedule receive experimental drug MRCC study . Patients permit concomitant bisphosphonates . Patients permit receive hematopoietic growth factor accord American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) guideline . 4 . Patients must prior radiotherapy area measurable disease , unless clearly progressive disease site , measurable disease outside area prior radiation . Radiotherapy , need palliation , must complete least 2 week prior enrollment study . 5 . Patients may significant medical disease ( malignancy ) , investigator 's opinion , would increase risk participation . Examples exclusion : unstable angina pectoris , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure , unstable symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia require medication ( subject control chronic atrial fibrillation eligible ) , myocardial infarction within 6 month , uncontrolled HTN ( blood pressure &gt; 150/90 therapy ) , correct QT interval ( QTc ) interval &gt; 500msec significant ECG abnormality uncontrolled DM . 6 . Patients must history disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use sunitinib malate might affect interpretation result study render subject high risk treatment complication . 7 . Concomitant treatment drug dysrhythmic potential ( terfenadine , quinidine , procainamide , disopyramide , sotalol , probucol , bepridil , haloperidol , risperidone , indapamide ) recommend . 8 . Patients unwilling participate unable comply protocol duration study .</criteria>
