	<detailed_description>The purpose proposal determine switch PD patient treat pramipexole ropinirole CR reduce non-motor side effect frequently experience patient . Side effect monitor particular include somnolence , peripheral edema , cognitive decline without hallucination . PD patient follow MUO Neurology Clinic treat pramipexole evidence least one follow symptom : somnolence , cognitive impairment without hallucination , peripheral edema offer opportunity participate study . Fifteen subject currently receive pramipexole therapy ( monotherapy adjunctive therapy ) experience one follow symptom : somnolence , cognitive decline with/without hallucination , peripheral edema ask willing participate time clinic visit PDMDP . The crossover pramipexole ropinirole CR perform 2 week interval . During first week , initial drug dose substitute ½ pramipexole ½ target dose ropinirole CR . If subject tolerate drug change , 100 % target dose ropinirole CR ( pramipexole ) start second week .</detailed_description>
