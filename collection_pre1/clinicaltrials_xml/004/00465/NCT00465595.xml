Cardiovascular screening : There least four blood pressure assessment occasion least two separate day . Within day , assessment occasion separate least 15 minute . Each assessment occasion involve two blood pressure reading . To qualify study , mean blood pressure ( mm Hg ) four assessment occasion exceed 140 systolic 90 diastolic . Blood pressure take subject rest seat supine least 5 minute . As recommended Joint National Committee Prevention , Detection , Evaluation Treatment High Blood Pressure , assessment involve average 2 reading separate two minute . If first 2 reading differ 5 mm Hg , additional reading obtain average . On one blood pressure measurement occasion , volunteer acclimate automated blood pressure monitor equipment repeatedly take blood pressure ( least 3 reading ) device . Because experience timetotime blood pressure reading automate equipment variable due measurement artifact , read initially exceeds threshold value reassess twice within 4 minute assure accuracy .</criteria>
