	<brief_summary>Picoplatin new type platinum drug investigate several clinical trial , may provide improved safety profile current treatment option . This study design compare efficacy safety picoplatin plus Best Supportive Care ( BSC ) BSC alone . Best Supportive Care include care treatment optimize comfort patient ability function , well minimize side-effects anti-cancer treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Picoplatin Efficacy After Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 study enroll subject Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC ) refractory progressive within 6 month complete first-line , platinum-containing chemotherapy . Subjects centrally randomize 2:1 receive picoplatin plus BSC every 3 week , BSC alone . After discontinuation picoplatin , subject continue receive BSC continue evaluate every 3 week discontinuation study , death , end study . After discontinuation picoplatin , subject may treat another chemotherapy physician 's discretion follow survival .</detailed_description>
