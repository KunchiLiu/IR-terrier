	<brief_title>The Antioxidant Effect Routine Vascular Therapy Normal Tension Glaucoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two accept medical modality glaucoma treatment . The first , local application intraocular pressure ( IOP ) lower drug . The second , application systemic drug improve vascular regulation . In present study would like investigate whether systemic form treatment , addition improve blood flow , also reduce systemic oxidative stress . Vascular dysregulation one major risk factor glaucoma , particular normal tension glaucoma ( NTG ) . In glaucoma patient blood flow , average , reduce eye also various organ body , example finger . Such systemic dysregulation lead disturbed autoregulation thereby unstable oxygen supply eye.This , turn , lead formation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . These ROS capable damaging cell white blood cell ; damage , however , reversible nature provide u mechanisms repair damage . This reversible damage bring ROS , constantly repair body , indication oxidative stress . Oxidative stress play important role pathogenesis glaucoma . The indication oxidative stress quantify laboratory method comet assay also know single cell gel electrophoresis .</detailed_description>

'' `` Do people tell cold hand ? '' ) report . For healthy subject : An intraocular pressure &lt; 20 mmHg No history ocular systemic disease No history chronic current systemic topical medication , drug alcohol abuse Normal blood pressure ( 100140/6090mm Hg ) Best correct visual acuity 20/32 eye No pathological finding upon slitlamp examination indirect fundoscopy EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Iridocorneal angle extremely narrow complete partial closure determine gonioscopy Pigmentary dispersion pseudoexfoliation Evidence secondary cause glaucomatous optic neuropathy ( trauma , steroid , uveitis ) History chronic recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease ( eg . scleritis , uveitis ) clinically significant progressive retinal disease ( eg . diabetic retinopathy ) History ocular trauma intraocular surgery within past 6 month History systemic infection inflammation within past 3 month Need concomitant medication may interfere evaluation leukocyte ( eg : steroid , immunosuppressive ) Patients significant history /or active alcohol drug abuse ( significant define may influence result study )</criteria>
