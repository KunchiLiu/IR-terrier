	<brief_title>A Long-Term Study Examining Treatment Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia With Photoselective Vaporization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enlarged prostate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) one common diseases age men associate low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) urinate often , sudden strong feeling urinate , get night urinate , decrease intermittent force stream feel incomplete bladder empty . These symptom affect quality life interfere normal daily activity sleep pattern . When surgery best treatment option patient , common technique `` transurethral resection prostate '' ( TURP ) . TURP involve remove extra tissue prostate gland . Even though TURP good treatment , concern frequency complication follow treatment well significant cost patient , doctor , insurance provider . Photoselective vaporization prostate ( PVP ) relatively new technology similar benefit few side effect TURP . PVP minimally invasive procedure use special high-energy laser eliminate excess prostate tissue seal treat area . This technology use decade 200,000 procedure perform worldwide . The focus study 1 ) document long-term advantage GreenLight HPS 120w 2 ) show strong laser flexible efficient device allow short procedure time , may do out-patient setting healthy patient , allow short catheterization time , may result rapid urinary flow rate minimal side effect , may allow quick return normal activity . This device approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment obstructive BPH .</detailed_description>
