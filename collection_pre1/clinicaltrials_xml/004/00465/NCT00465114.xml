	<brief_summary>Severe preeclampsia often present uncontrolled hypertension therefore require close monitoring blood pressure cardiac performance . The purpose study compare two method measure performance heart pregnant woman : one ultrasound heart , assess pulse generate blood vessel wrist . We hope method use pulse analysis effective ultrasound , labour intensive operator dependant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimally-invasive Assessment Cardiac Output Severe Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe preeclampsia often present uncontrolled hypertension , require close monitoring blood pressure cardiac output . It useful know cardiac output patient population , guide choice antihypertensive drug measure effect cardiac output . Traditionally pulmonary artery catheter use measure cardiac output . There numerous problem use method severe preeclampsia . These include technical difficulty insert catheter awake , edematous pregnant patient , potentially cause pneumothorax , damage carotid artery insertion site infection . There also increase risk cardiac arrhythmia . Apart risk , accuracy thermodilution measurement influence factor time injection within respiratory cycle , temperature injectate , speed injection , placement catheter . A readily available , accurate non-invasive cardiac output measurement technique , provide reliable data few risk , need . Doppler ultrasound ( trans thoracic echocardiography ) gold standard measure cardiac output non-invasively pregnant patient . Unfortunately method operator dependant , continuous always available need . Recently device call FloTrac introduce measure cardiac output minimally invasively . Attached arterial line measure cardiac output every 20 second via arterial waveform analysis . The standard care measure blood pressure severe preeclampsia require placement intra-arterial line . This group patient therefore ideal measure cardiac output FloTrac , especially since powerful intravenous anti-hypertensives use control blood pressure . Our hypothesis FloTrac comparable Doppler Ultrasound measure cardiac output severely preeclamptic patient .</detailed_description>
