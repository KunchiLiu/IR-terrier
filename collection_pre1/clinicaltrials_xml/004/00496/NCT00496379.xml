	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine effect ( good bad ) ZK219477 ( sagopilone ) participant cancer . ZK219477 chemotherapy drug think work interfere ability cancer cell grow divide . It part group drug call `` epothilones '' appear cause shrinkage cancer patient breast cancer . It generally difficult chemotherapy enter brain . However , believe ZK219477 cross brain . We also study whether investigational MRI scan procedure may eventually help predict patient benefit ZK219477 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZK219477 ( Sagopilone ) Patients With Breast Cancer Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants give ZK219477 intravenously approximately 30 minute every three week . - During treatment cycle physical exam question participant general health specific question problem may perform . - At least every three week blood test do assess effect ZK219477 body . - After every 2 cycle treatment , participant additional scan assess effect ZK219477 cancer . This include CT scan abdomen , chest , pelvis , MRI brain . - At time standard MRI , participant ask undergo additional MRI sequence , mean MRI machine approximately 15-20 minute .</detailed_description>
