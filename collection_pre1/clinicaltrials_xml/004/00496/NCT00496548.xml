	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether urinary PGE-M level correlate Crohn 's disease activity compare well urinary PGE-M correlate non-invasive biomarkers disease activity C-reactive protein ( CRP ) fecal calprotectin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Prostaglandin E Metabolite ( PGE-M ) , A Metabolite Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) : A Novel Biomarker Crohn 's Disease Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The available clinical measure Crohn 's disease activity overly influence functional symptom . Placebo response rate clinical trial high . Several non-invasive biomarkers currently available assess IBD disease activity include erythrocyte sedimentation rate , C-reactive protein fecal calprotectin . Although marker hold promise , performance less ideal . What need simple , non-invasive , biologic measure Crohn 's disease . Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) involve prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) synthesis express epithelial inflammatory condition cancer . We develop assay quantify major urinary metabolite PGE2 , PGE-M. PGE-M previously show elevated urine patient advance colorectal neoplasia relative control .</detailed_description>
