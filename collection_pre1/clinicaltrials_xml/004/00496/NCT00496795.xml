	<detailed_description>Aim The scientific aim study explore mechanism resistance chemotherapy breast cancer . To , explore molecular parameter predict response chemotherapy administer prior local therapy large , primary breast cancer . Background Neoadjuvant ( primary medical ) therapy get wide acceptance primary therapy breast cancer . In addition , treatment provide optimal set study mechanisms drug resistance human cancer . Considering chemotherapy primary breast cancer treatment , contemporary trend treat tumor aggressively . High-dose therapy involve stem cell support advocate , show improve long-term survival early breast cancer . However , attitude general toward aggressive approach within frame `` conventional '' therapy . Based theoretical modeling , alternative approach , `` dose-dense '' therapy , advocate . Recently , concept bring test two adjuvant trial . Thus , Citron et al apply doxorubicin , paclitaxel cyclofosfamide reveal improved outcome dose-dense ( 2-weekly ) administration compare regular 3-weekly scheduling . In contrast , German GEPARDUO study report doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide docetaxel , give sequence 3-weekly basis ( 8 cycle ) , superior doxorubicin docetaxel give concert 2-weekly basis 4 cycle . However , dos administer ( doxorubicin 50 versus 60 mg/m2 ; docetaxel 75 versus 100 mg/m2 ) unequal , meaning total drug dose exposure differ two treatment arm . While data warrant , reasonable interpretation available data suggest sequential administration different compound dose-density approach suitable regimen provide adequate total dos give . Rationale regimen Considering anthracyclines , regimen today combine either epirubicin doxorubicin concert 5-fluorouracil cyclophosphamide . However , base evidence literature , clear contribution 5-FU cyclophosphamide effectiveness regimen , particular taxane administer sequence concert . Thus , NSABP-group abandon use 5-FU adjuvant regimen . Considering cyclophosphamide , compound seem add carcinogenetic effect anthracyclines enhance risk secondary leukemia , contribution antitumor efficacy regimen remain uncertain . The taxanes know significant antitumor effect breast cancer administer monotherapy . Considering docetaxel , dose generally advocate monotherapy 100 mg/m2 , dose 75mg/m2 recommended combine use . Thus , potential exists dose combine use may sub-optimal patient . Justification sequential approach support study metastatic breast cancer . Scientific aim While many mechanism resistance identify experimental system , little knowledge may cause drug resistance human cancer . The factor far identify find associate resistance chemotherapy breast cancer amplification HER-2 / Topo-II mutation affect TP53 . Recently , several group explore responsiveness chemotherapy use mRNA microarrays . While study consistently identify different gene profile correlate responsiveness different regimen , predictive value low clinical application . Moreover , result add understanding biological mechanism cause drug resistance . In contrast , study explore different form cancer start reveal specific gene alteration , particular affect pathway DNA damage repair apoptosis relation drug resistance . Thus , primary aim explore potential gene disturbance base functional hypothesis . A major issue identify mechanisms drug resistance explore different compound monodrug basis . Clinically , major reason combine administer sequentially anthracycline taxane efficacy compound combine significant lack cross-resistance . Administered combine schedule , limit possibility identify mechanism resistance / sensitivity compound individually . Provided sequential regimen provide efficacy combined schedule , approach justify ethically . Thus , patient give 2 3 drug concert , potential may respond one drug , toxicity compound . In case non-responsiveness single compound , may exchange alternative treatment option . This contrast possibility provide adjuvant setting . In adjuvant therapy , way may assess response individual drug ; thus different compound administer concert . Based say , consider sequential dose-dense treatment use epirubicin docetaxel sequentially feasible treatment option . Treatment regimen Each patient receive 4 cycle epirubicin 60 mg/m2 give 2 weekly interval together G-CSF . Thereafter , docetaxel 100 mg/ m2 give 2 weekly interval 4 cycle . Patients reveal positivity HER2 status trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) implement together docetaxel anthracycline treatment . Staging baseline After give informed consent , patient stag follow : - MRI breast - Chest X-ray - Liver ultrasound ( case metastases suspect verify ; follow CT / MRI confirmation ) - Skeletal scintigram . Any positive finding confirm subsequent X-ray / CT / MRI - ECG - LVEF ( Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ) Response evaluation Response evaluate base clinical examination MRI , assessment do separately . Clinical examination perform prior commence therapy ( surgical biopsy ) subsequently 4 , 6 8 week therapy . Response classify accord common `` RECIST '' criterion . An important exception make . As argued previous protocol , consider RECIST definition `` progressive disease '' 20 % increase sum large tumor diameter liberal respect large primary tumor . Based experience clinic , believe definition progressive disease increase &gt; 25 % product large tumor diameter perpendicular ( previous common UICC criterion ) suitable definition , protect patient undergoing deterioration clinical condition . This accordance previous experience . In case `` progressive disease '' stage epirubicin treatment , patient terminate epirubicin immediately go ahead docetaxel treatment . In case progressive disease docetaxel treatment , therapy leave physician 's discretion . Considering MRI assessment , perform prior commence therapy , interval follow 4th cycle epirubicin ( prior commence docetaxel ) 4th cycle docetaxel , prior surgery . Tissue sample 1 . Each patient undergo surgical biopsy prior commence treatment . 2 . A Tru-cut biopsy obtain 24 hour administration first epirubicin cycle ass `` immediate '' alteration response cytotoxic damage . 3 . Immediately prior commence treatment docetaxel , third sample ( time Tru-Cut biopsy ) obtain snap-freezing . 4 . A Tru-cut biopsy obtain 24 hour administration first docetaxel cycle ass `` immediate '' alteration response cytotoxic damage . 5 . Finally , tumor tissue collect snap-frozen surgery follow docetaxel therapy . Bone marrow aspiration A single unilateral bone marrow aspiration perform prior commence chemotherapy treatment . Study Endpoint - Primary endpoint correlate molecular parameter objective response 2 regimen apply . - Secondary endpoint : - correlate molecular parameter relapse-free overall survival - identify explore characteristic epithelial mesenchymal stem cell isolated tumor tissue bone marrow Surgery While many center practice breast conservative surgery tumor successfully downstaged primary medical treatment , general apply conservative approach , advocate mastectomy . However , downstaging limited surgery primary secondary endpoint study . In general , advocate mastectomy also patient clinical complete response . However , practice may change base contemporary result center , protocol allow limit surgery physician discretion individual patient . Laboratory Investigations The area molecular biology rapidly develop respect biological knowledge well technical analytical method . Thus , possible predict upfront gene may particular interest 5 year know ; neither possible foresee completely laboratory method available . Our aim explore potential genetic alteration explain mechanisms drug resistance . While possible predict detail , aim study analysis conduct aim major goal . Number patient enrol The study exploratory translational study . Thus , know number patient expect achieve clinical pathological complete response . Currently , average 20 patient refer Department diagnosis locally advance breast cancer annual basis ; include patient tumor measure 4 5 cm diameter , estimate total number may somewhere 30 40 patient per year . From cohort , estimate average number 20 patient enrol study annual basis . Our aim recruit 100 patient minimum 60 . Publication Our aim publish result study peer-reviewed international journal contributor clinic laboratory author . References ; Trial Administrator upon request .</detailed_description>
