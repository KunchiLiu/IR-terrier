	<detailed_description>Diabetes self-management education increasingly recognize best practice guideline reimbursement policy critical ingredient appropriate health service , especially Latino population . Latinos , addition carry heavy burden diabetes related comorbid condition , encounter limit access health care health education due economic , language cultural barrier . The propose project health status health care utilization outcome study . It unique : 1 ) evaluate low-cost replicable , community-based , diabetes education model , 2 ) study long-term effect low-cost , easily replicable reinforcement system , ATDM call , 3 ) target Spanish-speakers , high risk type 2 diabetes , diabetes-related complication , under-served exist program . The background study derive long-standing program research chronic disease self-management automate telephone disease management ( ATDM ) well research others . This research demonstrate : 1 ) Self-management program ATDM program improve health-related quality life , metabolic control , health care utilization . 2 ) The effect program health-related quality life health care utilization mediate partially enhancement perceive self-efficacy cope consequence chronic disease . 3 ) Self-management education potential achieve substantial financial saving decrease use inpatient outpatient health care . Information outcomes health self-management program Latinos fragmentary . However , analyse Spanish language Arthritis Self-Management Program analysis pilot Spanish Diabetes Self-Management Program suggest self-management program extend successfully Latinos . Work Piette demonstrate 1 ) monolingual Spanish speaker use automate telephone disease management ( ATDM ) call part care , 2 ) Latinos use ATDM call access health education , 3 ) ATDM-supported diabetes care improve health-related quality life , metabolic control self-management behavior . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Six factor contribute significance propose research . These include 1 ) grow population Latinos United States , 2 ) disproportional burden diabetes Latino population , 3 ) cost diabetes care couple decrease access care uninsured underinsured , 4 ) lack well developed evaluate diabetes education intervention Latinos , 5 ) grow evidence psychosocial intervention diabetes impact health status health care cost , 6 ) evidence perceive self-efficacy important mediator change health relate quality life . Growing Latino Population Approximately 22 million Latinos represent 9 % total population currently live United States1 Latinos expect large minority group early century.2 One third nation 's Latino population live California,3 60 % 7.7 million foreign born.4 , 5 By 2007 slightly one third California 's population expect Latino.5 Latinos low level education demographic group United States . Only 45 % Latinos California , compare 50 % nationally , complete high school.3 Approximately 400,000 Latinos 65 old . Between 1983 1988 group grow rate nearly 27 % , make fast grow group elderly population United States.6 California Latinos twice poverty rate whites.5 Burden Diabetes Certain factor endemic among Latinos , low socioeconomic status , less formal education , language cultural barrier , reduce access health care , contribute morbidity mortality associate diabetes . Morbidity Morbidity data suggest 14 % Latinos suffer diabetes.7 Data several study indicate prevalence diabetes nearly 3 time great among Latinos non-Latinos.5 , 7-9 It also metabolically severe , place great risk medical complication diabetic retinopathy , neuropathy , end-stage renal disease peripheral vascular disease.10-15 The high rate morbidity likely continue future Latinos risk factor , especially physical inactivity , unfavorable body fat distribution obesity woman , high blood pressure.16 , 17 Mortality National mortality statistic Latinos , even available , reliable . Until recently , neither national data set death certificate contain Latino identifiers.4 Despite , comparative study mortality rate Latinos non-Latino white specific cause . While study limitation , suggest mortality rate due diabetes high Latino men woman non-Latinos.18 These rate especially high among Mexican Puerto Rican woman , appear fourth lead cause death two groups.19 The single great complication diabetes across Latinos heart disease . While data available heart disease mortality secondary diabetes , know cardiovascular disease lead cause death among Mexican Americans , make 63 % U.S. Latino population . Within group , Spanish speaker high cardiac mortality.16 Although cardiovascular mortality decline country , decline slowly Latino population still lead cause death among old Latinos.20 Costs Access Over one third Latinos United States completely uninsured,21 rate growth uninsured Latino population great non-Latino population.22 While 76 % white non-elderly Californians private health insurance , 43 % Latinos do.21 Even cover insurance , Latinos low outpatient utilization rate white , especially English-speaking.2 However , twice many Latinos report use emergency room service primary care compare whites.23 Latinos also enter hospital via emergency room white , longer expensive hospital stays.24 This especially important hospitalization account 60 % cost associate diabetes.25 In addition uninsured , language cultural barrier also contribute utilization preventive health care among Latinos . Spanish-speaking Latinos encounter obstacle seek health care within complicate health care system , less likely find regular source medical care.2 The pattern health care utilization describe suggest diabetes self-management education may assist Latino population reduce emergency room use day hospital . Diabetes Patient Education Programs Latinos While grow epidemiological literature health status Latinos , able find two publish article intervention U.S. adult Latinos diabetes . One article report feasibility pilot , community-based , diabetes patient education group support program Spanish-speaking diabetic , include use group discussion videos teach diabetes-specific management skills.26 The study , Piette , discuss section B.7.2 . While many diabetes program target Latinos , appear rigorously evaluate . Evidence Suggesting Effectiveness Psychosocial Self-Management Programs Diabetes There grow evidence psychosocial program effective people chronic disease general diabetes particular . As documented Mazzuca meta-analysis , large range health status change expect . The mean effect size change approximately .3.27 Programs show low blood pressure ; 28-30 reduce mortality hypertension,31 melanoma,32 hematologic malignancies,33 breast cancer ; 34 , people diabetes , increase health-related quality life metabolic control.26 , 35-43 Several review establish efficacy psychosocial intervention people diabetes.36 , 44 , 45 From literature clear psychosocial intervention help patient improve metabolic control diabetes self-management behavior . Some evidence also exist improvement health-related quality life . Most diabetes education study short term . The following exception . Mulrow colleague conduct intervention low-literacy type 2 diabetic . Initial weight loss sustain 11- month follow-up.46 Rubin colleague , however , conduct cop skill train program demonstrate sustain benefit term emotional well-being one year.47 Studies Weinberger Piette use continue interventions.38 , 48 Both study demonstrate sustained improvement term metabolic control health-related quality life . In summary , evidence diabetes educational intervention improve metabolic control quality life . The need reinforcement less clear , although appear program continue intervention seem produce good long-term result short program . PRELIMINARY STUDIES Overview This propose study possible convergence six line inquiry : 1 ) outcome study demonstrate influence chronic disease self-management improve health status English- Spanish-speaking patient , 2 ) outcome study demonstrate effectiveness automate telephone intervention improve health status Latinos diabetes , 3 ) pilot study diabetes self-management program Latinos , 4 ) methodological study establish effective mean recruit collect data Spanish-speaking people chronic condition , 5 ) availability valid self-administered instrument , translate Spanish validate Spanish-speaking individual throughout United States abroad ; 6 ) theoretical study identify mechanisms self-management intervention affect health status . The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Study ( English ) The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program study design test general applicability self-management program mixed group different chronic disease . In study , 1,140 person 40 year age old least one target disease ( heart disease , lung disease , stroke and/or arthritis ) randomize receive 7-week ( 2.5 hour per week ) peer-led , community-based self-management program usual care control status . Treatment group include patient different chronic disease . After six month , control receive Chronic Disease Self-Management Program . Subjects participate program follow one three year . Content English Chronic Disease Self-Management Program base literature review input 11 focus groups.71 , 72 The self-management activity focus skill need manage task involve deal chronic illness describe Corbin Strauss.73 These include : 1 ) treatment task necessitate illness exercise , symptom management , take medication ( ) , communicate health care provider , 2 ) task need maintain alter one 's life role face chronic condition , 3 ) emotional task deal anger , depression uncertain future . The course development inform self-efficacy theory teach use efficacy-enhancing strategy include emphasis skill mastery , modeling , reinterpretation symptom , social persuasion . In English Chronic Disease Self-Management Program , participant ' mean age 65 65 % participant female . Subjects average 2.3 chronic disease 7 % diabetes . Treatment subject , compare control subject , demonstrate improvement 6 month weekly minute exercise , frequency cognitive symptom management , communication physician , self-reported health , health distress , fatigue , disability , social/role activity limitation . They also fewer hospitalization , few day hospital ( p &lt; .05 ) 74 ( publication include Appendix 1 ) . The whole study population , include original intervention group control group , receive intervention six-month wait follow three year . Each year three year compare baseline , ER/outpatient visit health distress reduce ( p &lt; .05 ) . Disability increase expect rate ( p &lt; .05 ) . There significant change outcome variable . There evidence increase perceive self-efficacy associate decreased health distress , turn marginally associate future reduction outpatient visit . Spanish Diabetes Self-Management Pilot As part project support Hospital Council Santa Clara County , develop evaluate community-based , peer-led diabetes self-management program Spanish speaker , use three-month pre-test/post-test design . Like previous program , course base needs assessment conduct four group diabetic Latinos . In addition conduct three focus group nutritionists diabetes educator work Northern California Kaiser Permanente system . The purpose later group identify content key message include program . The program review diabetes nurse educator , nutritionist , diabetologist . Courses offer two different organization summer 1998 1999 . Program participant complete human subject 's requirement fill baseline questionnaire mail telephone first session SDSM pilot program . The questionnaire send Stanford , Patient Education Research Center staff collect miss data telephone . Three-month post-intervention data collect either mail telephone . One hundred nine people participate SCSM pilot program complete data collection . Program participant make significant ( p &lt; .05 ) improvements health behavior ( exercise , diet , practice relaxation technique , examine foot , communication provider ) . Similarly , health status improve measure health-related quality life variable ( self-reported health , fatigue , physical discomfort , health distress , role/activity limitation ) self-reported fast blood glucose level ( p &lt; .05 ) . No significant improvement find health care utilization . There trend , however , toward less utilization ( specifically , less ER use few hospitalization ) . Automated Telephone Disease Management Studies Piette colleague conduct feasibility study Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) outpatient clinic determine whether low-income patient diabetes able willing use touch-tone telephone provide information health self-care.78 During one month , patient complete 216 ( 83 % ) assessment attempt report number health problem might otherwise go undetected clinician . Patients overwhelmingly report found ATDM call helpful ( 98 % ) , difficulty respond call ( 98 % ) . The majority also report would like receive ATDM call part usual care ( 89 % ) , receive call would make satisfied VA care ( 77 % ) . Two follow-up randomize trial conduct . The first study determine impact ATDM-supported diabetes care 280 low-income English- Spanish-speaking patient recruit indigent-care clinic . Intervention patient receive 12-months biweekly ATDM call follow-up diabetes nurse educator . Control patient receive usual care . The second randomized trial evaluate similar intervention tailor VA care . In study , 301 patient enrolled randomized 12-months ATDM-supported telephone care usual care . Patients study complete ATDM assessment consistently twelve month participation satisfy experience79 ( publication include Appendix 1 ) . Across study , patient successfully complete 4,000 bi-weekly ATDM assessment 71 % assessment attempt . Only 4 % attempt terminate patient hung telephone prematurely . Patients report self-monitored blood glucose level 70 % successful assessment . In 12-month follow-up survey , 87 % patient report `` moderately '' `` '' satisfied ATDM call . Eighty-six percent say receiving call would make satisfied health care , 79 % say personally would choose receive similar call future . Spanish-speaking patient respond least consistently English-speakers satisfied system . This despite fact half Spanish-speakers report formal education . Data study indicate patient diabetes interested receive self-care education via ATDM call . On average , Spanish-speaking patient select optional self-care tip 64 % ATDM call compare 36 % English speaker ( p &lt; .0001 ) . Spanish speaker also select dietary education module often ( 52 % versus 28 % , p &lt; .0001 ) . After 12 month , Spanish speaker roughly one fourth English speaker continue select message type receive substantial amount education result . Data randomize trial suggest ATDM-supported diabetes care improve self-care , glycemic control , patient-centered outcome . Among participant county clinic trial , outcome data collect 12-months 248 ( 89 % ) enrollees . Compared usual care group , intervention patient follow-up report frequent glucose self-monitoring , foot inspection , weight monitoring , few medication adherence problem ( p &lt; .03 ) .48 The publication include Appendix 1 . Mean follow-up HbA1c value among intervention control patient 8.1 % 8.4 % ( p = .01 ) , twice many intervention patient within normal range HbA1c ( p =.04 ) . Intervention patient also low mean serum glucose level ( 180mg/dl versus 221 mg/dl ) report good glycemic control ( p &lt; .005 ) . On average , intervention patient report few diabetic symptom usual care patient ( 4.0 versus 5.4 ) ( p &lt; .0001 ) include few symptom hyperglycemia ( p &lt; .0005 ) hypoglycemia ( p &lt; .001 ) . Importantly , impact within Spanish-speaking subgroup great see sample overall . The average HbA1c among Spanish speaker intervention group 1.1 % low ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.2 % 1.9 % ) among usual care group , six time many Spanish-speaking intervention patient normal end point HbA1c level ( 18 % versus 3 % , p = .05 ) . In addition , mean serum glucose level follow-up 71 mg/dl low ( 95 % CI 13 129 mg/dl ) among Spanish-speaking patient intervention group , intervention patient 1.6 few symptom Spanish-speaking control ( 95 % CI = 0.0 3.2 ) . ATDM-supported diabetes care also positive impact patient-centered outcomes81 ( publication include Appendix 1 ) . Compared control patient , intervention patient report great satisfaction care , especially technical quality service receive , choice provider continuity care , communication provider , quality health outcome ( p &lt; .04 ) . There also improvements patient ' self-efficacy perform self-care activity ( p = .006 ) , perceive access care . Compared patient receive usual care , receive intervention report few symptom depression follow-up ( p = .02 ) few day bed due illness ( p &lt; .03 ) . Data VA randomize trial currently analyze . Preliminary finding indicate impact patient ' self-care , glycemic control , satisfaction care similar described.82 Summary In summary , substantial work diabetes self-management program development result randomize study outcomes mediate process provide strong foundation extend self-management program diabetes . These study also produce set validated outcome instrument , verified strategy data collection within target population . This program research conduct within conceptual framework informs implementation intervention .</detailed_description>
