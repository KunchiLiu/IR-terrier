	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open label , phase II study test ITF2357 population high-risk relapsed/refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma patient . The patient receive 50 mg ITF2357 four time day 6-hour interval feed condition 28 consecutive day unless evidence progressive disease , presence unacceptable adverse event patient 's request discontinue treatment occur . Decision regard continuation ITF2357 make : - basis tumor reassessment upon completion cycle define later 7 day - occur toxicity ( ) . If complete response partial response stabilization disease first cycle , without concomitant relevant toxicity observe , treatment may continue long evidence progressive disease appearance unacceptable adverse event . In case treatment shall exceed 84 day drug intake overall ( i.e . 12 week ) . Treatment administer outpatient basis patient follow regularly physical laboratory test , specify protocol ; case hospitalization , treatment continue interrupted accord Investigators ' decision . The study accrue 23 patient evaluable efficacy anticipate duration study 18 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>phII Study HDAC Inhibitor Very High-risk Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) enzymes involved remodel chromatin , key role epigenetic regulation gene expression . In addition , activity non-histone protein regulate HDAC-mediated hypoacetylation . In recent year , inhibition HDACs emerge potential strategy reverse aberrant epigenetic change associate cancer , several class HDAC inhibitor find potent specific anticancer activity preclinical study . Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) relatively uncommon lymphoma histotype , incidence Italy approximately 1700 new case per year ( approximately 12 % lymphoma ) . Combination chemotherapy without radiotherapy cure approximately 70 percent advanced-stage HL . Fifty percent fail patient salvage second line chemotherapy ( mainly high-dose regimen ) , remain patient eventually die disease progression . The development effective salvage regimen refractory/resistant population represent true unmet medical need . The use latter patient subset HDAC inhibitor , like ITF2357 , support several consideration . Namely : ( 1 ) chemically relate HDACi hydroxamate show activity clinical condition ; ( 2 ) drug markedly inhibit production several cytokine , cytokine production HL granuloma define role pathogenesis HL ; ( 3 ) effective treatment refractory/relapsed HL presently lack ; ( 4 ) ITF2357 , 200 mg daily per o , show favorable toxicity profile . All mention argument represent strong rationale prompting use ITF2357 patient population .</detailed_description>
