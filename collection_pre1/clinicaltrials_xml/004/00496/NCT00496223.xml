	<detailed_description>This combination Phase I/II design explore toxicity activity combination sunitinib Dacarbazine ( DTIC ) metastatic melanoma . Screening test ( pre-study ) consist history , physical , CBC , CMP , EKG , pregnancy test woman childbearing age , amylase ( blood test diagnosis pancreatitis pancreatic disease ) , stag CT , PK . Also , day 1 , test repeat - history , physical , toxicity assessment , CBC , amylase test . Re-staging test perform 2 complete cycle follow indicate clinically . The initial Phase I part trial consist dose escalation sunitinib keep DTIC dose constant . Sunitinib give 2 week 1 week DTIC give every 21 day one cycle . If DLT see , maximum tolerate sunitinib dose suggest Phase II trial dose . Tumor response measure 2 complete cycle . Subsequently , Phase II trial enroll patient ; le 2 response see , patient enrol , study consider negative activity . But , clinical response see , patient enrol Phase II dose .</detailed_description>
