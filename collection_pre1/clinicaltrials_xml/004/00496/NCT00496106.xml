	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . Test efficacy psychosocial telephone counseling ( PTC ) cervical cancer survivor , compare usual care . 2 . Evaluate longitudinal immune neuroendocrine parameter cervical cancer patient receive PTC , compare usual care . 3 . Examine longitudinal relationship PTC associate modulation quality life ( QOL ) measure biologic parameter ( immune neuroendocrine ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress , Immunity Cervical Cancer : Biobehavioral Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence mortality rate invasive cervical cancer minority , low-income , less educated woman exceed white , high income , well educate woman . In southern California incidence mortality rate cervical cancer nearly twice non-Latina white woman . Our preliminary work support extend extant literature , note quality life significantly disrupt among cervical cancer survivor , qualitative difference Latina woman experience cancer survivorship . However , paucity literature intervention design assist cervical cancer survivor manage illness-specific stress improve health behavior . Our current NIH-funded work suggest six session psychosocial telephone counseling ( PTC ) intervention improve QOL decrease psychological distress , accompany intervention-induced neuroendocrine immune parameter modulation may relate disease endpoint . In primary support significant biobehavioral finding , project herein propose accomplish follow Specific Aims : 1 . Test efficacy PTC cervical cancer survivor , compare usual care . 2 . Evaluate longitudinal immune neuroendocrine parameter cervical cancer patient receive PTC , compare usual care . 3 . Examine longitudinal relationship PTC associate modulation QOL measure biologic parameter ( immune neuroendocrine ) . To achieve aim investigator randomize patient ascertain two SEER cancer registry PTC ( N=125 ) usual care ( N=125 ) , stratify English Spanish language preference . Assessments occur baseline ( 9-20 month post diagnosis ) , three nine month post enrollment/baseline . Assessments include evaluation QOL ( overall QOL , psychological distress , cop , social support , sexual functioning ) , health behavior , neuroendocrine parameter dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate , growth hormone [ DHEA-S , cortisol , GH ] immunologic parameter ( natural killer [ NK ] cell activity , IL-5 , interferon , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) E6/E7 peptide , IL-15 , IL 10 ) . This project significant public health relevance important unstudied cancer survivor population , many poor underserved . If effective , intervention could improve quality life ( QOL ) health behavior , enhance neuroendocrine immune response woman cervical cancer could significant implication toward disease recurrence survival .</detailed_description>
