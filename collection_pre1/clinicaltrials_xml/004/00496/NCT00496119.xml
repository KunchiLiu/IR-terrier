	<brief_title>Proton Beam Therapy Chordoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proton therapy kind external beam radiation therapy proton direct tumor site . Researchers try determine level proton therapy give benefit without cause toxic side effect . Researchers also test treatment 's effect . If doctor feel necessary , proton beam therapy may combine standard photon therapy . If eligible take part study , receive proton beam therapy The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) , possibly photon beam , sooner 2 week last surgery remove tumor . You receive proton beam therapy day 35 treatment ( 7 week ) . Treatment give 5 day row week ( except Saturdays , Sundays holiday ) MDACC Proton Center Houston . The whole process take 1 hour day . This investigational study . The proton beam machine use deliver treatment approve FDA patient use . The dos study experimental . About 15 participant take part study . All enrol MDACC .</detailed_description>
