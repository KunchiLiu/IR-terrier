	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety tolerability combination Zactima metronomic chemotherapy . Zactima oral anti-angiogenesis drug , mean fight cancer cut tumor 's blood supply . Thus , drug starves tumor prevent delivery nutrient oxygen . Metronomic chemotherapy low dose oral chemotherapy pill take daily . Unlike traditional chemotherapy , metronomic chemotherapy think fight cancer like Zactima , cut blood supply tumor . Because dose low , side effect generally mild different high dose chemotherapy give vein .</brief_summary>
