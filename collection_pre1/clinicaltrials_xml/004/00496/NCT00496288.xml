	<brief_summary>Women BRCA germline mutation face high risk develop breast cancer live . It show carrier patient , breast conservation , comprise lumpectomy follow whole breast radiation , associate increase risk ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence compare non carrier ( 10-15 % 10 year ) , especially also underwent prophylactic oophorectomy . Yet risk subsequent contralateral breast cancer significantly increase , report high 25-30 % 10 year 40 % 15 year , compare 3 % 7 % respectively non carrier . The reduction ipsilateral disease attribute radiation affect breast . We propose breast cancer patient BRCA germline mutation choose breast-conserving therapy refuse prophylactic contralateral mastectomy , prophylactic radiation contralateral breast may reduce rate subsequent contralateral breast cancer offer option risk reduction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial design statistic : This multi center- phase II open comparative trial . `` Patients '' - Those choose prophylactic contralateral breast irradiation . `` Controls '' - Those opt prophylactic irradiation mastectomy . Objective - compare rate contralateral breast cancer `` patient '' versus `` control '' . Assuming 2/3 eligible carrier breast cancer patient refuse procedure : To detect difference 10 % vs. 25 % incidence contralateral breast cancer power = 80 % , alpha = 0.05 , 80 patient 160 control need enrol . Treatment : Chemotherapy , Hormonal therapy XRT affect breast per treat institution . Radiation therapy : Patients undergo pre-treatment planning CT 5mm cut treatment position , breast board , arm extend head . The organ risk ( heart , lung ) contour CT scan . The affected breast ( index lesion ) associate lymphatic drainage treat accord treat physician decision . The contralateral breast treat 2 tangent field , use 1.8-2 Gy/fx total dose 50-50.4 Gy . The whole breast treat accord traditional guideline describe RTOG/NSABP B39 study . The heart completely block leave sided breast , include lung tissue reduce minimum . No overlap field allow skin two breast field midline . Maximal dose exceed 110 % . Follow : The treat physician follow patient every 2 week radiation treatment . Side effect score recorded patient chart accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v3.0 . Subsequent follow-up schedule accord treat institution ASCO guideline . Patients undergo annual mammogram breast US . Annual breast MRI bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy recommend . Ipsilateral contralateral breast cancer record report . Any subsequent malignancy breast cancer report . Long-term radiation side effect record .</detailed_description>

The patient consent contralateral prophylactic irradiation . 1 . Metastatic breast cancer . 2 . Previous irradiation breast chest wall . 3 . Pregnancy . 4 . No concurrent chemotherapy allow 5 . Patients active connective tissue disease exclude due potential risk significant radiotherapy toxicity . 6 . Patients unable lie back raise arm head treatment plan position radiotherapy exclude</criteria>
