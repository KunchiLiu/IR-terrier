	<detailed_description>Azacitidine new chemotherapy drug design destroy cancer cell high dos . At low dos , design destroy cancer cell well cause change may make cancer cell less harmful . Valproic acid drug use every day practice treatment seizure , migraine headache , mood disturbance bipolar disorder . Before start receiving study drug , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam , include routine blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) . You may get either CT scan MRI measure disease one within 1 month . Women able child must negative blood-pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive study drug `` cycle . '' Cycles generally 4 week long may longer , depend side effect experience azacitidine . During cycle , receive azacitidine skin day first 10 day ( Day 1 Day 10 ) . You 18-day break receive azacitidine injection rest cycle . Additionally , take valproic acid pill mouth , every day , start first day first cycle ( Day 1 Day 28 ) . You take valproic acid every day study without interruption . The dose azacitidine receive depend enroll study . You part study group `` cohort '' ( 6 patient enrolled cohort ) . All member cohort receive dose azacitidine begin receive study drug . Each new cohort receive high dose cohort . The dose azacitidine receive may adjust depend well tolerate . The start dose valproic acid fix patient , dose may adjust physician base result blood work . You physical exam blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) every two week first two study drug cycle . For cycle , physical exam blood test month . Your disease measure CT scan MRI every 2 treatment cycle . You may continue receive study drug study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . After participation study , receive follow-up care , standard care disease . This investigational study . The FDA approve azacitidine blood disease know myelodysplastic syndrome . Its use study experimental . The valproic acid drug approve FDA treatment seizure , bipolar disorder , migraine headache . Up 68 patient take part study . All enrol M. D.
