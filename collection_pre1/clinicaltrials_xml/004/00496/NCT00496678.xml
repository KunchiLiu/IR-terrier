	<detailed_description>Racial ethnic minority group low-income person experience significantly high cancer mortality rate Americans . These disparity due least two factor : ( 1 ) delay follow-up abnormal cancer screen result ( 2 ) suboptimal management diagnose cancer . Patient navigation represent promise mean address disparity improve cancer relate management minority underserved population . However , patient navigation cancer yet evaluate well-designed randomized control trial . Furthermore , patient navigation likely prove effective sustainable integrate primary care help patient active care . This combination patient empowerment enablement refer `` activation . '' The aim project evaluate effectiveness cost program rigorous manner result generalize program widely disseminate implement . develop , implement , evaluate primary care-based , patient navigation-activation program use specially-trained community health worker ( CHWs ) . We propose investigate effect intervention time quality cancer-related care . Secondary aim examine impact navigation disparity care , improvement patient activation total cost . Project find inform national policy regard patient navigation cancer .</detailed_description>
