	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES 1 . The primary patency graft follow thrombectomy angioplasty limited high re-stenosis rate . 2 . Stent deployment reduces likelihood re-stenosis site stenotic lesion , thereby prolong primary graft patency follow thrombectomy , decrease delay need future intervention . 3 . The cost saving arise stent deployment ( decrease subsequent access procedure ) outweigh additional cost stent . AIMS 1 . To evaluate whether stent placement thrombose graft underlie stenosis venous anastomosis result longer primary graft patency , compare angioplasty alone . 2 . To determine whether stent placement thrombose graft underlie stenosis venous anastomosis reduces subsequent cost access procedure excess cost stent . To accomplish goal , conduct randomize clinical trial hemodialysis patient refer treatment thrombose A-V graft . The patient randomize treated thrombectomy + stent deployment thrombectomy + angioplasty . The primary outcome primary ( unassisted ) graft patency . The secondary outcome secondary ( assist ) graft patency cumulative cost access-related procedure , hospitalization , complication . SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND Most patient end-stage renal disease undergo hemodialysis thrice weekly optimize survival , minimize medical complication , enhance quality life . A reliable vascular access critical requirement provide adequate hemodialysis . The ideal vascular access would easy place , ready use soon place , deliver high blood flow indefinitely , free complication . None exist type vascular access achieve ideal . Among three type vascular access currently available , A-V fistula superior A-V graft , turn superior dialysis catheter . Recognizing relative merit vascular access type , NKF-DOQI guideline recommend placement A-V fistula 50 % hemodialysis patient , A-V graft 40 % , dialysis catheter 10 % [ 19 ] . The actual current distribution vascular access among prevalent hemodialysis patient United States 25-30 % fistula , 45-50 % graft , 25 % dialysis catheter [ 20 , 21 ] . Vascular access procedure subsequent complication represent major cause morbidity , hospitalization cost chronic hemodialysis patient [ 22-26 ] . Over 20 % hospitalization hemodialysis patient United States access-related , annual cost access morbidity close $ 1 billion [ 25 ] . A-V graft prone recurrent stenosis thrombosis fistula , require multiple radiologic surgical intervention ensure long-term patency dialysis [ 26 ] . A report UAB observe first salvage procedure maintain graft patency ( thrombectomy , angioplasty , surgical revision ) require 29 % graft 3 month , 52 % 6 month , 77 % 12 month , 96 % 24 month [ 5 ] . Most graft require multiple intervention time maintain patency dialysis . A mean 1.22 intervention require maintain access patency per graft-year , include 0.51 thrombectomy , 0.54 angioplasty , 0.17 surgical revision . Secondary graft survival ( time initial placement permanent failure , regardless number intervention ) range 59 87 % one year , 50 73 % two year [ 27-35 ] . A number study examine association demographic clinical factor long-term graft survival , consistent clinical predictor poor graft outcome emerge . Windus et al [ 27 ] observe low graft survival diabetic compare nondiabetics . In contrast , three study observe significant difference graft survival diabetic nondiabetic patient [ 5 , 35 , 36 ] . Several investigator report lack association patient age sex long-term graft survival [ 5 , 35-37 ] . Windus et al [ 27 ] find old age predict low graft survival non-diabetics , diabetic patient . Graft survival similar upper arm forearm graft [ 5 , 29 ] . Finally , hypoalbuminemia associate short A-V graft survival 2 report [ 5 , 36 ] . The major cause graft failure thrombosis due underlying stenosis venous anastomosis , drain vein , central vein [ 10 , 38 ] . When stenosis detect correct timely fashion , graft typically thrombose . Clotted graft require thrombectomy either Radiology Surgery , commonly association correction underlie stenosis . If graft patency restore , become necessary construct vascular access new anastomotic site . Intervention-free graft patency considerably low follow thrombectomy elective angioplasty [ 10 ] . A comparison graft outcomes radiologic intervention institution find primary ( unassisted ) patency 30 % 3 month clot graft , compare 71 % patent graft undergo elective angioplasty [ 10 ] . Not surprisingly , graft survival bad residual stenosis angioplasty . However , even subset patient residual stenosis intervention , primary 3-month patency still lower clotted graft , compare patent graft undergo elective angioplasty ( median survival , 2.5 v 6.9 month ) . Because graft patency much bad follow thrombectomy elective angioplasty , current state clinical access management involve ongoing surveillance program monitor evidence hemodynamically significant graft stenosis , referral patient elective angioplasty surgical revision . The rationale approach correction graft stenosis timely fashion decrease risk graft thrombosis prolong survival graft [ 19 ] . Substantial clinical research direct evaluate predictive value several noninvasive screening test identify hemodynamically significant graft stenosis , patient refer angioplasty surgical revision graft chance clot . These surveillance method include : dynamic dialysis venous pressure , static dialysis venous pressure , recirculation , Doppler ultrasound , ultrasound dilution methodology , access blood flow ( Reviewed [ 39 ] ) . Graft stenosis also predict aggressive clinical monitoring ( look decrease Kt/V , prolong bleeding graft needle site , abnormality graft inspection auscultation [ 1 , 40 ] . A number observational study report substantial ( 50-60 % ) reduction frequency graft thrombosis use variety surveillance method [ 40-43 ] ; none eliminate problem . Four randomized study evaluate efficacy access surveillance graft outcomes find surveillance excellent tool identify hemodynamically significant graft stenosis . However , high frequency preemptive angioplasty surveillance group appear translate reduction graft thrombosis prolongation graft survival [ 44-47 ] . This discrepancy suggest preemptive angioplasty may effective produce sustained improvement stenotic lesion . Stent deployment may improve durability graft angioplasty decrease variability operator graft patency follow radiologic intervention . Thus , possible frequent use stent might enhance value graft surveillance . Graft stenosis occur consequence aggressive myointimal hyperplasia , occur commonly venous anastomosis [ 48 ] . Vascular injury result angioplasty may actually accelerate process myointimal hyperplasia , thereby result early re-stenosis [ 49 ] . Endoluminal stent , form rigid scaffold venous anastomosis , may slow encroachment area myointimal hyperplasia vascular lumen , thereby limit magnitude recurrent stenosis . Thus , use stent may utility prevent restenosis follow angioplasty . Stent placement attempt treatment graft angioplasty result suboptimal technical success stenosis recur rapidly . A number small series report outcomes stent placement vascular access refractory stenosis [ 50-56 ] . Unfortunately , study suffer several methodologic limitation , include retrospective data collection , absence suitable control group , combine patent thrombose graft , combine stent place variety stenotic site , combine graft fistula . A small , randomize study compare stent conventional angioplasty find difference primary graft patency follow intervention [ 54 ] . However , study enrol mixture clot grafts patent graft , stenotic lesion variety location , limit interpretation finding . A recent , uncontrolled study report outcomes clotted graft undergo thrombectomy , well stent placement venous anastomosis [ 50 ] . In homogeneous group graft , primary graft patency 63 % 6 month . Although matched control group treat angioplasty alone , unassisted graft survival far superior report several series ( 11 34 % 6 month ) [ 10 , 57-61 ] RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Design : This open-label , prospective , randomized clinical trial compare outcome thrombose AV graft treat mechanical thrombectomy angioplasty ( current standard care ) , compare stent deployment mechanical thrombectomy angioplasty .
