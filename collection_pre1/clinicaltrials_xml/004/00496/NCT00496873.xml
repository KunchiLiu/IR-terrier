	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn treatment combination three drug , Cytoxan ( cyclophosphamide ) , Rituxan ( rituximab ) Nipent ( pentostatin ) , help control disease patient previously untreated non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , CLL , bulky lymphoma . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Efficacy Nipent , Cytoxan , Rituxan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All drug [ Cytoxan ( cyclophosphamide ) , Rituxan ( rituximab ) Nipent ( pentostatin ) ] study commonly use treatment cancer . However , use drug combination investigational . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam . You blood collect ( around 2-3 tablespoon ) routine test . You chest x-ray CT scan chest , abdomen ( stomach ) , pelvis ( waist area ) . Tumors measure use x-ray . You sample bone marrow collect . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . If doctor feel necessary , may also lymph node biopsy sample take special test . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . During treatment give combination three drug 21 day ( 3 week ) cycle . All drug give needle vein 4-6 hour . You receive pentostatin first , rituximab , lastly cyclophosphamide . For treatment cycle cyclophosphamide , rituximab , pentostatin give Day 1 , follow 20 day rest . During treatment , around 2-3 tablespoon blood collect least week routine test . You also provide urine sample routine urine test . Depending disease responds , treatment may stop 3 , 6 , 9 cycle . You take treatment disease get bad . If treatment delay 2 week due side effect related treatment 3 week reason , take study . If doctor feel serious intolerable side effect improve standard supportive care method ( medicine control nausea transfusion treat anemia ) take study . After Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , tumor measure use x-rays scan ( CT MRI ) . Bone marrow sample take needed find drug combination work control disease . The maximum number cycle receive 9 . If wish continue use drug treatment , beneficial , may continue receive drug . However , drug commercially available , financially responsible cost drug . After receive last cycle chemotherapy , doctor decide schedule follow-up exam . You follow-up exam every 3 month one year , every 6 month 2nd year , 1 year . During exam , chest x-ray CT scan chest , abdomen ( stomach ) , pelvis ( waist area ) . You also blood collect ( 2-3 tablespoon ) routine test . This investigational study . All study drug approve FDA cancer treatment commercially available . However , use drug combination investigational . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
