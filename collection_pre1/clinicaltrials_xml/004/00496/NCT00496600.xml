	<brief_summary>This unblinded , dose escalation study patupilone combination RAD001 subject advanced cancer find maximum tolerated dose drug . The purpose study see dos RAD001 patupilone safe use two drug use time . Other goal study learn effect RAD 001 patupilone tumor growth ; find amount RAD001 present blood combine patupilone ; learn protein blood may predict show effect RAD001 patupilone learn change see tumor type test call PET scan.Subjects assign dose group . The dose patupilone RAD001 subject get depend enter onto study . The initial subject study take low dos RAD001 patupilone . At least 3 subject treat dose group start small dose . If easy handle side effect , next group least 3 people enter study get next high dose . This continue high dose study drug find cause serious hard treat side effect . Both subject study doctor know dose assign . In study , RAD001 give tablet take water . RAD001 take either 7 , 14 , 21 day 21 day cycle depend dose group assign . If take RAD 001 patupilone day , RAD 001 take water however prior receive patupilone.Patupilone give intravenous injection ( vein ) 20 minute Days 1 day 6 21-day cycle . The patupilone dose base height weight . Blood test ( approximately 1-3 teaspoon ) do every week . Every six week CT scan MRI do assess tumor size . Subjects continue receive RAD001 patupilone long tumor stable shrinking , many side effect treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint To identify maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) combination patupilone RAD001 Secondary Endpoints To assess toxicity patupilone RAD001 To determine concentration RAD001 elevate presence patupilone To evaluate tumor response use standard imaging modality ( CT scan , x-ray , bone scan ) To develop pharmacodynamic marker may predict indicate response mTOR inhibition patupilone treatment .</detailed_description>
