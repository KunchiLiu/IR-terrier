	<brief_summary>Subjects advance metastatic ( spread part body ) breast cancer HER2/neu-positive take part study . This type breast cancer high amount protein call HER2 . HER2 part family receptor find cancer normal cell . This family receptors important cell growth find many tumor type . The purpose research study compare approve treatment breast cancer capecitabine , also call Xeloda速 , combination capecitabine plus experimental drug , lapatinib also know Tykerb速 , treatment advance metastatic breast cancer HER2/neu-positive.Capecitabine approve type chemotherapy use treat certain cancer include breast cancer . Capecitabine fight cancer interfere ability cell divide tumor growth . Lapatinib ( Tykerb速 ) consider `` investigational '' , mean drug approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) sale prescription over-the-counter medication . Lapatinib may slow stop cancer cell grow inhibit growth cancer cell . However , theory proven . The addition study drug ( lapatinib ) capecitabine may help stop cancer cell well well capecitabine alone . Other study demonstrate activity tolerability lapatinib either alone combination capecitabine treatment breast cancer.Subjects receive capecitabine lapatinib . A treatment period 21 day long . This period know `` cycle '' . All medication give mouth . Subjects take capecitabine 2 week straight ( Day 1-14 ) follow 1 week without capecitabine ( Day 15-21 ) . Doses lapatinib take daily continuously 21 day ( Day 1-Day 21 ) mean subject still take lapatinib week take capecitabine ( Day 15-21 ) . Subjects continue receive medication unless experience severe , serious and/or excessive side effect , cancer becomes bad , subject wish longer participate study doctor feel best interest continue treatment.Tests procedure physical exam , blood test , CT MRI , ECG , ECHO and/or MUGA test conduct one follow time point : study start , cycle , every 6 12 week , last dose capecitabine/lapatinib treatment .</brief_summary>
