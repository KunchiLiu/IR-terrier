	<brief_title>Proton Beam Therapy Chondrosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients skull base chondrosarcoma require complicate treatment challenge location nearness critical structure within brain . Pathology confirm prior discussion study . If find eligible take part study , receive proton beam therapy , sooner 2 week last surgery remove tumor . You receive proton beam therapy day 35 treatment ( 7 week ) . Treatment give 5 day row week ( except Saturdays , Sundays , holiday ) Proton Center Houston . The whole process take 1 hour day . If doctor feel necessary , proton beam therapy may combine standard photon therapy . After proton beam , possibly photon beam , therapy , ask come study follow-up visit every year , study complete . At visit , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , blood draw ( less 1 teaspoon ) monitor pituitary function , neuropsychological testing . For neuropsychological testing , interview tested neuropsychologist evaluate memory , fluency ( ability talk form word ) complex think ability , plan ability , coordination . These test could last 1-2 hour . You also eye exam perform ophthalmologist MD Anderson hear exam . It anticipate take 5 year complete study . This investigational study . The proton beam center treatment approve FDA patient use . A total 15 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
