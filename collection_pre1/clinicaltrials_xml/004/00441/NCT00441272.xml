	<brief_summary>This study determine whether pioglitazone ( Actos , drug approve treat diabetes , benefit HIV-infected people fatty liver . Fatty change liver ( also know steatosis ) link diabetes long-term liver damage patient . Pioglitazone show improve fatty liver people without HIV ; study see beneficial people HIV well . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old increase fat liver may eligible study . Screening include CT scan liver biopsy ( withdrawal small sample liver tissue needle ) . Participants randomly assign take either 45 mg pioglitazone placebo ( sugar pill ) mouth day 48 week . At end 48 week , participant stop take medication follow additional 48 week see , benefit , pioglitazone persist treatment stop . In addition take study medication , participant undergo follow procedure : - Visits NIH Clinical Center period approximately 2 year day 0 week 2 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 , 52 , 72 , 96 . Most visit take 1 hour include blood draw various laboratory test . - Insulin clamp test day 0 week 24 48 see body process glucose . This test take 4 6 hour may include overnight stay Clinical Center . A catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein arm infuse insulin another place vein back hand draw blood sample . Blood sugar check frequently glucose give keep blood sugar normal value . - Nutrition evaluation day 0 week 24 48 . Subjects write food eat drink 4 day visit . They meet nutritionist review food record complete simple measurement body fat shape . - CT scan liver abdomen week 24 , 48 , 72 96 . - Liver biopsy week 48 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While introduction antiretroviral therapy HIV/AIDS transform HIV disease chronic infection many , use antiretroviral therapy also often associate metabolic abnormality include insulin resistance , central fat accumulation peripheral fat atrophy . Fatty infiltration liver hepatic steatosis may important consequence metabolic derangement may represent direct toxicity associate HIV infection and/or antiretroviral medication . Preliminary data suggest hepatic steatosis may common perhaps present 50 percent HIV-infected patient receive antiretroviral therapy . Hepatic steatosis represent one step potential progression towards hepatocellular injury , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , , small percentage patient , subsequent fibrosis cirrhosis . In addition , hepatic fat content closely associate impaired insulin resistance type 2 diabetes , condition increasingly recognize among HIV-infected patient . In set type 2 diabetes mellitus NASH , thiazolidinediones pioglitazone , show reduce hepatic steatosis , low transaminase level improve insulin sensitivity . In order determine potential benefit pioglitazone therapy set HIV infection hepatic steatosis , conduct 96-week , double-blind , randomize placebo control trial pioglitazone ( 45 mg/day ) 50 HIV-infected men woman , 48 week active treatment 48 week observational follow-up study treatment end . We anticipate need screen 100 subject identify sufficient number eligible participant enroll study . The primary outcome variable interest trial change hepatic fat score , liver-to-spleen ratio , calculate CT scan abdomen . Important secondary outcome histologic improvement liver biopsy perform baseline 48 week , well improvement transaminase level insulin sensitivity measure hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp . All participant follow 48 week discontinue study treatment evaluate short-term natural history steatosis receive placebo assess durability potential benefit pioglitazone upon withdrawal . In way , important information efficacy pioglitazone treat hepatic steatosis improve metabolic profile HIV-infected patient obtain , well preliminary data whether benefit pioglitazone sustain treatment discontinue .</detailed_description>
