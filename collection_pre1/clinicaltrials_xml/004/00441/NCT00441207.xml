	<detailed_description>Preclinical study pharmacologic dos vitamin C ( ascorbic acid , ascorbate ) show significant anticancer effect animal model tissue culture investigation include cytotoxic effect certain cancer cell line micromolar millimolar concentration . Early clinical study show intravenous oral dos vitamin C may improve symptom prolong survival terminal cancer patient . More recent double-blind placebo-controlled study show oral adminstration vitamin C provide benefit cancer patient . Conversely , intravenous vitamin C administration raise plasma concentration high 14 mM/L , concentration 1-5 mM/L find selectively cytoxic tumor cell vitro . The proposed Phase I trial vitamin C achieve millimolar concentration vitamin C show kill tumor cell vitro . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) , PK , possible drug accumulation repeat dosing , quality life , pain response , fatigue status , hint efficacy patient advanced cancer examine .</detailed_description>
