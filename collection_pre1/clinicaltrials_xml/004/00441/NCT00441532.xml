	<brief_summary>Patients risk prostate cancer usually undergo biopsy prostate . This often do private urology office . Recent study suggest injection local anesthesia ( lidocaine ) near nerve prostate improve pain sensation biopsy procedure . Local anesthesia give separate needle rectal probe prior biopsy . However , many urologist date perform biopsy without anesthesia . Some claim needle use anesthesia cause pain . Others claim pain minimal additional use lidocaine ( extra time ) necessary .

	<brief_title>Study On Lidocaine Vs . Placebo Pain Control During Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients risk prostate cancer usually undergo biopsy prostate . This often do private urology office . A probe ultrasound insert rectum patient biopsy take spring-loaded needle . Most urologist take four six biopsy side prostate . Years ago , biopsy traditionally do without anesthesia . Patients experience pain firing spring-loaded needle , generally tolerable . Recent study suggest injection local anesthesia ( lidocaine ) near nerve prostate improve pain sensation biopsy procedure . Local anesthesia give separate needle rectal probe prior biopsy . However , many urologist date perform biopsy without anesthesia . Some claim needle use anesthesia cause pain . Others claim pain minimal additional use lidocaine ( extra time ) necessary . We plan reexamine use lidocaine perform first study patient receive lidocaine placebo separate side prostate . Patients undergo traditional prostate biopsy procedure . They urology center William Beaumont Hospital . Patients lie side ultrasound probe insert rectum . The size prostate measure ultrasound probe . A study coordinator hand physician syringe contain either 2.5mL lidocaine saline ( placebo ) . Neither patient physician know solution syringe contains . The 2.5mL first syringe inject traditional area local anesthesia inject ( periprostatic area ) right side . Next , second syringe hand physician contain opposite drug ( lidocaine saline ) physician inject leave side . Four six biopsy take right side , study coordinator record patient pain 1 10 scale injection 2.5mL , biopsy . Biopsies take left side , , study coordinator record result patient pain 1 10 scale . At end procedure , patient give questionnaire ass overall pain , tolerability procedure , whether could tell side prostate receive anesthesia .</detailed_description>
