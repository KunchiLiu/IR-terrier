	<brief_title>The Role P-cresol Related Protein Fermentation Metabolites Chronic Kidney Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protein-bound uremic retention solutes increasingly recognize play role pathophysiology uremic syndrome . Numerous vitro finding indicative implication biochemical physiological change uremia . Several protein-bound retention solute originate bacterial protein fermentation colon . p-cresyl sulfate , fermentation metabolite amino acid tyrosine , consider prototype group uremic solute . The protein bind molecule show 90 % end-stage renal disease patient . Several data suggest p-cresol play role immunodeficiency uremia . Recently , link molecule endothelial dysfunction demonstrate . Also member class protein-bound solute find associate immune dysfunction , endothelial cell dysfunction , closely related latter , oxidative stress . Free serum level p-cresol show great stage 5 chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient treat hemodialysis ( HD ) hospitalize infectious disease . Furthermore , positive relationship find serum total p-cresol level uremic symptom score patient treat peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) , whereas correlation small water-soluble solute middle molecule Î²2-microglobulin absent . A recent prospective observational study stage 5 CKD patient treat conventional HD ( 3 x 4 hour per week ) indicate accumulation p-cresol risk factor overall mortality . Data serum concentration p-cresol chronic kidney disease patient lack . The investigator hypothesise serum concentration p-cresol independent predictor progression end stage renal disease independent predictor cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
