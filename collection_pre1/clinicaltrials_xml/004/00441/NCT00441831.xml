	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylorus ( HP ) gram-negative bacillus responsible one common infection find human worldwide . By early-to-mid 1990s , evidence emerge support link chronic gastritis HP infection malignancy adult , specifically gastric lymphoma adenocarcinoma . The potential HP eradication prevention gastric cancer underline . At national consensus meeting hold Brussels 1998 , HP eradication strongly recommend past current peptic ulcer disease , regardless activity , complication post endoscopic resection early cancer . Some patient receive gastric surgery due complication peptic ulcer bleed perforation pre-HP eradication era . Their HP infection status survey unknown time . Afterward , suggest receive eradication therapy recover operative procedure . According consensus treat HP purpose reduce risk gastric cancer , patient still risk . There survey prevalence persistent HP infection patient undergone surgery . The aim study evaluate prevalence histological feature HP infection time course partial distal gastric surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The eradication H pylorus know reduce recurrence rate peptic ulcer gastric inflammation . But still clear prevalence HP infection patient surgical intervention micro-environment change . Since biliary enterogastric reflux suggest inhibit growth HP , investigate prospective study effect partial gastrectomy influence HP infection incidence . Patients previous distal gastrectomy prospectively evaluate study group . Same number patient indication endoscopy evaluation without previous gastrectomy establish normal control group H pylori infection rate comparison . All patient study control group previously receive H pylori eradication therapy exclude . Three gastric biopsy specimen collect patient histological analysis . Patients pre-operative biopsy , operative specimen reveal H pylori colonization positive serum H pylori IgG indicate previous H pylorus infection assess percentage spontaneous clearance HP infection . A positive bile stain indicate biliary enterogastric reflux . This assessment make two investigator , disagreement resolve joint discussion reach consensus . Tissue section stain hematoxylin eosin Giemsa stain examine pathologist unaware endoscopy finding . Density HP tissue histological gastritis activity intestinal metaplasia grade normal ( 0 ) , mild ( 1 ) , moderate ( 2 ) severe ( 3 ) base Sydney system . Follicular gastritis base absence ( 0 ) presence ( 1 ) lymphoid follicules lymphoid germinal center ( 2 ) . The primary end point change infection rate HP distal gastrectomy procedure compare normal control . The secondary end point assess correlation duration antrectomy , operative procedure , severity bile reflux inhibition HP growth . Finally , study base histopathological feature density HP , grade gastritis activity , intestinal metaplasia follicular gastritis .</detailed_description>
