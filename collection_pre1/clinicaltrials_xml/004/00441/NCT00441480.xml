	<brief_title>Effect Plant Sterols Esterified Fish Oil Fatty Acids Plasma Lipid Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phytosterols omega-3 fatty acid ( n-3 ) natural food ingredient potential cardiovascular ( CVD ) benefit . Phytosterols inhibit dietary cholesterol absorption biliary cholesterol re-absorption , thereby reduce blood cholesterol level , consumption n-3 associate significant reduction plasma triglyceride concentration . Furthermore , n-3 may also beneficially modify number risk factor CHD , like anti-inflammatory anti-thrombotic . The primary objective study determine whether plant sterol esterify fish oil fatty acid fish oil matrix improve lipid profile , predominantly LDL-cholesterol TG concentration healthy hyperlipidemic subject . In addition supplement efficacy lower CVD-related risk factor healthy evaluate .</detailed_description>
