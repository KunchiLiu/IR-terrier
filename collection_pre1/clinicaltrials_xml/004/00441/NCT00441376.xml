	<brief_title>A Study ThermoDox™ Combination With Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) Primary Metastatic Tumors Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ablative treatment approach , RFA microwave ablation , receive increased attention alternate treatment approach hepatic arterial embolization chemoembolization ( TACE ) percutaneous ethanol injection ( PEI ) majority patient either candidate surgical resection offer palliative supportive care diffuse disease . RFA apply repetitively patient treat multiple tumor time diagnosis upon tumor recurrence ( local distant site ablation ) , largely limited application tumor location size ( tumor near large vessel , bowel hepatobiliary tree difficult ablate ) . To extend volume ablation region control fashion patient improve ability kill tumor cell ablation margin region allow improve treatment HCC MLC lesion &gt; 3 cm diameter complete thermal ablation , Celsion Corporation develop ThermoDox , thermally sensitive , intravenously administer liposomal formulation doxorubicin capable selectively release drug content expose temperature &gt; 39.5°C . The concept behind treatment approach create large concentration gradient doxorubicin immediate region tumor border zone RFA induce cell necrosis . The temperature isotherm produce boundary region adequate activate doxorubicin release thermally sensitive liposome deposit locally around ablation zone . This effect increase region tissue treat beyond achievable RFA alone . Several clinical objective test study . The MTD ThermoDox confirm . This study ass safety use ThermoDox conjunction RFA multiple cycle , consistent clinical need subject . While study power define effectiveness combination RFA plus ThermoDox , result study allow assessment risk benefit design future study . This study also test alternative infusion reaction prophylaxis regimen .</detailed_description>
