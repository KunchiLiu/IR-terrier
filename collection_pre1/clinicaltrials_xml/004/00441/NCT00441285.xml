	<brief_title>Neurocysticercosis : Combined Treatment With Praziquantel ( PZQ ) Albendazole ( ABZ )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurocysticercosis single major cause acquire late-onset epilepsy world , common diagnosis immigrant population United States industrialized country . An estimated 50 million human affected Neurocysticercosis . The disease occur parasite call Taenia solium , pig tapeworm , infect brain , form cyst . Neurocysticercosis generally treat 1 2 drug , praziquantel albendazole . However , current treatment either drug alone totally effective . The goal trial determine combination drug therapy praziquantel albendazole safe effective cure Neurocysticercosis either drug administer alone . This trial consist two sub-studies parent study . In first substudy perform complete initial part guide design parent study , series 32 patient viable cystic intraparenchymal Neurocysticercosis treat either albendazole ( 15 mg / kg /d ) + praziquantel ( 50 mg / kg/ ) albendazole+Placebo double blind randomize study . Half patient group seizure disorder treat phenytoin half carbamazepine ( assign study ) . The study design power pharmacokinetic evaluation exploratory safety comparative cysticidal efficacy yet analyze . There safety concern . Pharmacokinetics ABZ PZQ obtain describe . In parent study , total 240 participant ( include 32 participant first substudy ) randomly choose receive albendazole + praziquantel , albendazole + placebo albendazole increase dose + placebo 10 day . These group also receive standard medication manage disease include appropriate anti-epileptic drug therapy . Participants stay hospital least 2 week treatment begin , include 5 day end anti-parasitic treatment . After discharge hospital , follow-up visit day 21 30 treatment begin , monthly day 90 , finally every 3 month complete 18 month . Brain image take 6 12 month treatment begin . For participant , duration trial 1 year half .</detailed_description>
