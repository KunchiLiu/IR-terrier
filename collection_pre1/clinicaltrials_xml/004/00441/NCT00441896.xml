	<brief_summary>The study two period ( 8-10 days/period ) , incomplete cross-over successive cohort 9 subject randomize , 2:1 ratio , 1 2 sequence , A B . In cohort , Sequence A , comprise 6 subject , receive ascend dos ganaxolone period 1 ganaxolone ( maximal dose attain period 1 ) ascending dos placebo period 2 . Sequence B , comprise 3 subject , receive ascend dos placebo period 1 receives maximum dose placebo ascend dos ganaxolone period 2 . The dose level subsequent cohort base upon experience gain previous cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Controlled Trial Ganaxolone Patients With Infantile Spasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male female , 4 24 month age ( inclusive ) diagnosis IS 24 hour video EEG ( vEEG ) record confirm diagnosis previously treat 3 few antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) eligible study . The subject able continue treatment concomitant AEDs ( 2 ; adrenocorticotropic hormone [ ACTH ] , corticosteroid , felbamate , vigabatrin allow concomitantly ) . A ketogenic diet permit maintain duration study . There total three weekly 24-hr video EEGs ( baseline , end week 1 2 treatment ) . Dosing titration begin day video EEG inpatient stay . All subject receive ganaxolone day second video EEG . A Data Monitoring Board ( DMB ) determine whether successive cohort subject dose increase dose level ; maximum 6 cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be diagnose IS ( regardless etiology except progressive neurologic illness ) . Diagnostic Criteria : Seizures consist single repetitive short muscular contraction lead flexion extension . Spasms may characterize tonic myoclonic contraction , may occur singly cluster , typically occur bilaterally symmetrically . The EEG pattern must consistent diagnosis IS ( hypsarrhythmia , modify hypsarrhythmia , multifocal spike wave discharge , etc ) . Have vEEG record confirm diagnosis IS . Have magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform determine possible cause IS . Have previously treat 3 few AEDs . If treat concomitant AEDs Current AEDs constant daily dose least 2 week ; Note : Subjects minor dose adjustment may allow enter study short period detailed discussion medical monitor . Have stable clinical response/plateau least 2 week Are able continue treatment 2 concomitant AEDs ( ACTH , corticosteroid , felbamate , vigabatrin allow concomitantly ) . A ketogenic diet permit maintain duration study . Be male female , 4 24 month age ( inclusive ) Have Parent/Guardian properly inform nature risk clinical study , willing capable comply clinical study procedure , give informed consent write prior enter clinical study Be able participate full term clinical study . Treatment corticosteroid , ACTH , vigabatrin , felbamate , AED approve Regulatory Agencies , 2 week prior randomization . Treatment two AEDs baseline . Have active CNS infection , demyelinate disease , degenerative neurological disease , CNS disease deem progressive ( exception tuberous sclerosis ) evaluate brain imaging ( MRI ) . Have disease condition ( medical surgical ) screening might compromise hematologic , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic system ; condition might interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion investigational product , would place subject increase risk . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , total bilirubin great four time upper limit normal ( ULN ) clinical laboratory value deem clinically significant Investigator . History recurrent status epilepticus . Have expose investigational drug within 30 day prior randomization .</criteria>
