	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study TNX-650 Treat Refractory Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) lymphoid malignancy account approximately 7,000 8,000 new cancer case per year United Sates . It occur bimodal age-incidence distribution peak 15- 30-year old 50- 60-year old age group . The pathological hallmark disease presence malignant Reed Sternberg ( RS ) cell . Reed-Sternberg cell intersperse among heterogeneous population non-malignant reactive cell , include T cell , eosinophil , neutrophil , B lymphocytes , plasma cell , histiocyte , fibroblast , stromal cell . While 80 % patient respond initial radiotherapy combination chemoradiotherapy , patient experience early relapse initial therapy refractory first-line therapy . These patient may treat second-line therapy , may include autologous bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . Patients HL relapse first- second-line therapy , refractory therapy , without autologous BMT , poor prognosis . The long-term event-free survival rate patient group le 10 % ; median survival 16 month . At present , patient treatment option investigational therapy .</detailed_description>
