	<brief_title>Zactima With Temodar During Radiation Treatment Newly Diagnosed Stage IV Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently standard treatment glioblastoma gliosarcomas temozolomide ( Temodar ) radiation therapy . This study do research show glioblastomas genetic change may cause excess certain cell growth factor receptor , cause uncontrolled tumor growth . The drug use research study , ZD6474 ( Vandetanib ) , design block receptor two growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . These growth factor important pathway promote tumor growth increase blood supply tumor . Blocking receptor may reduce blood supply tumor help slow tumor growth . There also laboratory evidence block receptor may increase sensitivity glioblastomas radiation therapy . This research study Phase I/II clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . We determine high dose ZD6474 ( Vandetanib ) give safely combine temozolomide ( Temodar ) radiation therapy . The purpose Phase II research study determine efficacy combination treatment ZD6474 ( Vandetanib ) standard therapy glioblastoma gliosarcomas , temozolomide ( Temodar ) radiation therapy . It look see patient fare treatment ( progress , 12 month treatment ) . In research study , safety combination treatment ZD6474 ( Vandetanib ) standard therapy glioblastoma gliosarcomas , temozolomide ( Temodar ) radiation therapy evaluate . We also look sample see correlation well patient treatment . This agent investigational treatment glioblastoma . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve ZD6474 ( Vandetanib ) use type cancer . All subject participate research study must NOT take certain type anti-seizure medication call enzyme induce anticonvulsant drug . These drug include follow medication : Dilantin , Tegretol , Phenobarbital trileptal .</detailed_description>
