	<brief_summary>Detrusor underactivity ( DUA ) men responsible LUTS significant minority , symptom indistinguishable see BOO . The International Continence Society ( ICS ) define DUA ' detrusor contraction inadequate magnitude and/or duration effect complete bladder empty absence urethral obstruction . Whilst reduce maximum urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) indicative void dysfunction , flow study distinguish DUA BOO , two principal cause low flow rate . DUA diagnose pressure-flow study ( PFS ) characterize low-pressure , poorly sustain , wave-like detrusor contraction associate poor flow rate . Overactive bladder ( OAB ) common term currently use clinical medicine describe complex low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) without incontinence commonly consist urgency , frequency , nocturia , troublesome incomplete emptying , , occasionally , pain . With exception pain incontinence , symptom often find together ; thus , term LUTS come replace previous term , urgency-frequency syndrome , urethral syndrome , prostatism . Drug treatment frequently use initial management approach LUTS old men.Among men desire treatment , general practice prescribe data show antimuscarinics often give elderly men . There theoretical concern inhibitory effect antimuscarinics detrusor contraction could aggravate void difficulty cause urinary retention patient BOO . There virtually data evaluate safety efficacy solifenacin treatment men DUA OAB .</brief_summary>
