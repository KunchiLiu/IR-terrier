	<brief_title>Effect Plant Stanols Cholesterol Absorption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serum cholesterol lower effect plant sterols well establish also know plant stanols inhibit absorption cholesterol . However , lack dose-response study directly measure cholesterol absorption efficiency prolong consumption plant stanols . Therefore study aim measure cholesterol absorption efficiency different plant stanol consumption level use stable isotope tracer method . Subjects randomize study group consume 20 g margarine different dose plant stanols ( 0.8 , 1.6 2.0g ) base cholesterol absorption efficiency screening ( high low absorber randomise separately ) . Cholesterol absorption test cholesterol tracer conduct twice : baseline 2-3 week margarine consumption period . Cholesterol absorption efficiency also examine indirect method i.e . follow concentration serum cholesterol precursor plant sterol blood . In addition serum total , LDL HDL cholesterol triglyceride follow .</detailed_description>
