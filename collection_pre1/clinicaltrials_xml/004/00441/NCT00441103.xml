	<brief_summary>General Note : throughout record , `` Rebif® New Formulation '' use historical consistency purpose . Objectives : Primary : To evaluate efficacy Rebif® New Formulation ( Interferon-beta-1a [ IFN-beta-1a ] , RNF ) , compare placebo , subject Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis active disease mean Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) end 16 week treatment Secondary : To evaluate efficacy RNF compare mean number combine unique ( CU ) lesion per scan per subject initial 16 week placebo treatment 24 week RNF treatment subject , originally randomize placebo . Primary Endpoints : The primary endpoint difference number CU active MRI lesion Week 16 RNF group ( Group 1 ) versus placebo group ( Group 2 ) . Secondary Endpoints : The secondary endpoint difference mean number CU active MRI lesion per scan per subject follow treatment period : Study Day 1 - Week 16 versus Weeks 17 - 40 subject randomize Group 2 .</brief_summary>
