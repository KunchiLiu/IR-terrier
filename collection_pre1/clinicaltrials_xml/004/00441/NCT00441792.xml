	<brief_summary>The primary aim determine difference hospital length stay septic patient give etomidate give midazolam induction rapid sequence intubation ( RSI ) emergency department . To achieve aim plan perform prospective randomize trial measure length stay patient meet sepsis criterion require intubation . The investigator compare in-hospital mortality rate patient give etomidate patient give midazolam induction . In addition hospital length stay , secondary endpoint two group include length stay intensive care unit , death within 48 hour admission , total number day intubate . Research Hypothesis : In adult patient present emergency department sepsis require rapid sequence intubation , length stay patient give etomidate great patient give alternative agent midazolam induction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Etomidate Patient Outcomes After Single Bolus Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Although use drug etomidate continuous sedation mechanically ventilate patient find detrimental effect patient mortality shortly introduction clinical practice , etomidate continue widely use induction agent endotracheal intubation . Recent data call question safety use etomidate even single bolus patient risk adrenal insufficiency , emphasize fact single bolus dos etomidate cause measurable adrenal suppression , consequently may cause increase vasopressor requirement hospital length stay . Alternative FDA-approved induction agent , midazolam , claim many author safer etomidate ; however , study formally compare agent . Research Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize critically ill adult patient present emergency department sepsis require rapid sequence intubation , hospital length stay patient give etomidate increase compare patient give midazolam induction . Specific Aims : The specific aim determine difference hospital length stay septic patient give etomidate give midazolam induction rapid sequence intubation emergency department . The investigator plan compare two group term length hospital stay , length ICU stay , duration intubation perform prospective , randomize , trial critically ill patient present emergency department sepsis require intubation . The investigator also compare mortality rate two group control severity illness use steroid hospitalize . Significance : If use etomidate induce anesthesia prior intubation find adversely affect length stay septic patient , reduction length stay patient might achieve use alternative agent induction . The current widespread use induction agent may adversely affect length stay septic patient significant implication patient management .</detailed_description>
