	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Cycloset® Compared With Placebo When Added Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previously conduct Phase III clinical trial , Cycloset® ( maximum dose 4.8 mg/day ) , administer either monotherapy combine sulfonylurea therapy , significantly reduce HbA1c , fast post-prandial glucose fast post-prandial triglyceride obese individual type 2 diabetes mellitus . Clinical study combine Cycloset® metformin part original Cycloset® clinical program metformin commercially available United States time study initiate . The present study design investigate efficacy safety Cycloset® compare placebo add metformin monotherapy person type 2 diabetes mellitus adequately control metformin therapy alone . A sufficient number individual screen enroll 326 subject ; approximately 276 subject expect complete treatment study termination ( Week 26 ) . The study population consist individual currently treat metformin , least 3 month prior study start . Subjects ever receive exogenous insulin therapy part outpatient diabetes treatment regimen exclude , take oral anti-diabetic agent metformin within 3 month screen ( e.g. , sulfonylurea , thiazolidinediones , alpha-glucosidase inhibitor , meglitinides ) . Subjects may male female ( surgically sterile , postmenopausal , use appropriate contraceptive method childbearing potential ) , age 18 75 year , inclusive , screen HbA1c value ≥ 7.5 % &lt; 11.0 % screen body mass index ( BMI ) range 25 kg/m2 42 kg/m2 , inclusive .</detailed_description>
