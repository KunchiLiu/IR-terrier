	<brief_summary>Cyclophosphamide widely use treatment cancer autoimmune diseases lupus nephritis . However , considerable variability response cyclophosphamide treatment . Cyclophosphamide pro-drug require initial activation CYP liver enzymes . Recent clinical study indicate possible role one CYP enzyme , CYP2C19 activation step . This enzyme genetic polymorphism ( variant lack functional activity ) people inherited variant poor metabolisers certain drug . The aim study determine whether response therapy New Zealand population lupus nephritis patient determine cyclophosphamide bioactivation ( metabolic phenotype ) CYP genotype . Currently way predict patient 's response cyclophosphamide . An understanding factor contribute therapeutic failure lupus nephritis particularly important due high morbidity mortality associate disease . There treatment option lupus nephritis patient fail respond cyclophosphamide . If successful , study may help identify patient unlikely respond cyclophosphamide thus unnecessarily expose drug may justify use new , costly immunosuppressive drug mycophenolate mofetil rituximab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) commonly affect kidney ( lupus nephritis ) patient lead progressive loss kidney function . In patient aggressive lupus nephritis , treatment cytotoxic agent Cyclophosphamide ( CP ) , modulation immune system proven effective delay progression renal disease however , variability patient respond cyclophosphamide therapy 10 % - 40 % patient fail achieve renal remission . Cyclophosphamide pro-drug , require metabolic bioactivation liver active drug . The major enzyme involve CYP2C19 CYP2B61,2 however display considerable functional activity part due genetic variant lack functional activity3 . A recent study demonstrate lack response cyclophosphamide associate CYP2C19 CYP2B6 poor metaboliser variants4 . A retrospective review patient lupus nephritis Middlemore hospital indicate Polynesian patient respond poorly cyclophosphamide progress end stage renal failure high mortality rate compare European patient . We hypothesise failure cyclophosphamide therapy may due high incidence CYP2C19 variant Polynesian population . An extremely high incidence ( 70 % ) homozygous CYP2C19 variant report Melanesian population5 study Samoan , Tongan , Cook Island Niuean pacific people indicate incidence may 4-fold high 3 % incidence European populations3,6 . If CYP2C19 clinically important bioactivation cyclophosphamide Polynesian population may increase risk therapeutic failure . Other factor may also result inter-patient difference activation cyclophosphamide liver . Changes metabolic phenotype result drug-drug interaction and/or disease modulation CYP enzyme expression . Hence also important also determine functional activity ( phenotype ) cyclophosphamide bioactivation well genotypic analysis analysis blood level cyclophosphamide active metabolite . This study determine genotype phenotype cyclophosphamide bioactivation patient lupus nephritis determine whether important determinant response therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients lupus nephritis require therapy intravenous cyclophosphamide Lupus nephritis define accord American College Rheumatology criterion presence either : 1. histological evidence renal biopsy ; 2. persistent proteinuria &gt; 0.5 g/day proteinuria &gt; 3+ dipstick ; 3. cellular cast type . Patients renal biopsy perform determine histological class lupus nephritis . Therapy cyclophosphamide typically use patient Class III , IV severe Class V lupus nephritis . Patients â‰¥ 18 year age Patients must able provide inform consent Those meet inclusion criterion Those patient retrospective study die</criteria>
