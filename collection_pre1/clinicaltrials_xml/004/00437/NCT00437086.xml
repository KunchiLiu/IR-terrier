	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Advanced Myeloproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy bortezomib patient symptomatic advance myeloproliferative disorder ( i.e. , myelofibrosis myeloid metaplasia , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , FIP1LI-PDGFRA-negative mast cell disease ) . - Determine safety drug administer modified schedule patient . Secondary - Determine effect drug bone marrow cellularity , tryptase-positive mast cell , reticulin fibrosis , osteosclerosis , angiogenesis respond patient OUTLINE : This prospective , open-label , pilot , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( systemic mast cell disease v chronic myelomonocytic leukemia v myelofibrosis myeloid metaplasia ) . Patients receive bortezomib IV weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 5 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve response ( complete remission , partial remission , minimal remission ) 2 course may receive additional 6 course therapy . Patients achieve stable disease acceptable toxicity 2 course receive bortezomib IV high dose twice weekly 2 week . Treatment high dose bortezomib repeat every 3 week 6 course . Patients responder undergo bone marrow aspirate biopsy peripheral blood collection evaluation bone marrow cellularity , tryptase-positive mast cell , reticulin fibrosis , osteosclerosis , angiogenesis fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) , immunohistochemistry , immunological laboratory method . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
