	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety administer peptide vaccine consist twelve different tumor-rejection antigen know present ovarian tumor cell . The vaccine design elicit immune response twelve different pathway essential tumor growth , survival metastasis.HLA-A2+ require criterion subject eligibility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Ovarian Cancer Peptides Plus GM-CSF Adjuvant With Ovarian , Tubal Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint determine safety feasibility administer ovarian cancer peptide woman undergone debulking surgery systemic chemotherapy , secondary objective evaluate immune response measure ELISPOT immunization , compare immune response measure ELISPOT achieve two different dose strategy assess disease relapse survival . Two cohort 9 patient treat different dos OCPM vaccine . They receive peptide vaccine subcutaneously week 0,1,2,3,5 and6 receive immunization every 1 month 6 month disease recurrence . The first 9 patient enter first cohort ; 1 few patient experience Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) next 9 enrolled second cohort . DLT define Grade 3 great hematologic non-hematologic toxicity autoimmune disease ( except fever , skin reaction , alopecia would grade 4 ) occur time first immunization 30 day last immunization . Toxicity assess dose level use CTC toxicity criterion . Ovarian cancer peptide-specific immune response measure ELISpot . Time disease relapse base composite assessment clinical sign , objective exam finding , radiologic imaging , CA125 result . A dose scheme consider safe &lt; 1 first 9 subject treat dose level experience DLT ( describe ) . A subject consider evaluable safety treat least one immunization . A T cell response consider positive ELISpot : mean number spot six well antigen exceeds number spot six control well 10 difference single value six well contain antigen six control well statistically significant level p â‰¤ 0.05 use Student 's test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must HLAA2+ patient histologically confirm , stage IIIIV epithelial ovarian , tubal , peritoneal cancer undergone optimal debulking complete clinical response frontline platin/taxane base chemotherapy . Subjects must receive frontline platin compound taxane chemotherapy follow primary surgical resection . Frontline treatment include 12 cycle treatment.Subjects must receive first dose study medication least 4 week 6 month since complete last dose frontline chemotherapy.A complete clinical response define : evidence disease physical exam , CT image scan abdomen pelvis , chest xray CA125 upper limit normal . History autoimmune disease , serious intercurrent chronic acute illness , active hepatitis , serologic evidence HIV , splenectomy , receive steroid immunosuppressive therapy .</criteria>
