	<brief_summary>This study design compare efficacy , tolerability , safety combination valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg versus amlodipine 10 mg patient essential hypertension adequately control ( define mean sit systolic blood pressure [ msSBP ] ≥ 130 mmHg ≤ 160 mmHg ) amlodipine 5 mg alone . The study evaluate efficacy tolerability treatment provide data assess blood pressure proportion patient develop peripheral edema .</brief_summary>
