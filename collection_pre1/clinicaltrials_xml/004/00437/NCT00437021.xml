	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate investigational smallpox vaccine , call IMVAMUNE® , respect safety immune ( body 's defense system ) response . Participants include healthy adult , age 18 old born 1971 , smallpox vaccine . Volunteers originally assign 1 5 group . In July 2007 , hold place Dryvax® group study modify . Volunteers , number 197 , assign chance one 3 group vaccinate twice IMVAMUNE® vaccine placebo ( inactive substance ) Groups A B , receive single vaccination IMVAMUNE® placebo Group F. Volunteers complete memory aid ( diary ) 15 day follow vaccination . Blood sample collect . Volunteers may participate 425 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study evaluate IMVAMUNE® smallpox vaccine respect safety optimization immune response different vaccination regimens vaccinia-naïve adult . Study subject must age 18 old born 1971 . Originally , 215 subject plan randomly assign 1 5 group immunized twice IMVAMUNE® vaccine placebo subcutaneously Groups A B , Dryvax® placebo scarification Group C IMVAMUNE® Dryvax® 2 placebo Groups D Group E. In July , 2007 , enrollment halt request Center Biologics Evaluation Research ( CBER ) . At time , enrollment include zero subject Group A , 2 subject Group B , 8 subject Group C , 6 subject Group D , 4 subject Group E. CBER place official hold enrollment Groups would administer Dryvax® , i.e. , Groups C , D E. Subjects previously enrol Groups C , D , E follow accord protocol . The protocol modify follow . One hundred ninety-five subject randomly assign 1 3 group immunized twice IMVAMUNE® vaccine placebo subcutaneously Groups A B , receive single immunization IMVAMUNE® placebo subcutaneously Group F. ( NOTE : A total 197 subject randomly assign Groups A , B , F 2 subject previously enrol Group B . ) Group A receive IMVAMUNE® vaccine placebo Days 0 7 . Group B receive IMVAMUNE® vaccine placebo Days 0 28 . Group F receive single dose IMVAMUNE® Day 0 . All subject complete memory aid 15 day follow vaccination . Groups C , D , E appropriate reactogenicity information collect vaccination lesion , present well dry . Adverse event collect 28 day vaccination . Specimens collect immunologic assay note clinic visit , well 1 year post last vaccination . Serious adverse event collect throughout study period . The primary safety objective evaluate safety IMVAMUNE® give single dose , IMVAMUNE® give 2 dose prime-boost regimen Day 0 7 Day 0 28 , IMVAMUNE® follow boost Dryvax® , IMVAMUNE® give simultaneously Dryvax® . The primary immunogenicity objective determine Geometric Mean Titer ( GMT ) neutralize antibody [ use Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) target antigen ] among subject receive regimen 2 dos IMVAMUNE® ( 1×10^8 , Days 0 7 , Group A ) non-inferior among subject receive 2 dos IMVAMUNE® ( 1×10^8 , Days 0 28 , Group B ) Day 14 follow 2nd dose . The secondary immunogenicity objective determine GMT , assess enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ( use MVA target antigen ) , among subject receive regimen 2 dos IMVAMUNE® ( 1×10^8 , Days 0 7 , Group A ) non-inferior among subject receive 2 dos IMVAMUNE® ( 1×10^8 , Days 0 28 , Group B ) Day 14 follow 2nd dose . The tertiary immunogenicity objective characterize kinetics , magnitude , duration cellular humoral immune response IMVAMUNE® alone IMVAMUNE® prime follow boost IMVAMUNE® Dryvax® , Dryvax® alone .</detailed_description>
