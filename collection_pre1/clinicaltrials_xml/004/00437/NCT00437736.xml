It first time agent administer human . At low dose level , first cycle duration 7 week . In subsequent cycle , APO010 administer 4 weekly dos follow two-week drug rest , cycle duration 6 week . Based preclinical study APO010 may cause liver toxicity drop platelet , recover within 5 day . The main aim study identify recommend dose APO010 future clinical study APO010 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Dose Finding Study APO010 Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two-centre , open label , uncontrolled , dose-finding phase I study , determine safety tolerability APO010 administer intravenous bolus injection per week patient solid tumor , therapy proven efficacy exist longer effective . The dose-escalations follow classical Fibonacci schedule , mean least three patient per dose-level , prior escalation . The dose-level assignment patient registration centralize SENDO-Switzerland &amp; Milan office . APO010 , Apoxis ' proprietary humanize recombinant mega-Fas-ligand , novel `` First class '' investigational anticancer agent . APO010 protein specific bind cognate Fas receptor cell surface induces apoptosis ( program cell death ) . This call extrinsic apoptotic pathway cell . APO010 show exert anticancer activity vitro animal model carry human xenograft variety cancer , include malignancy multiple myeloma , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , ovarian cancer . Its activity cell cycle independent , cross react know multi-drug resistance mechanism ( MDR ) appear synergistic variety commonly use anticancer drug . Hence , APO010 may attractive candidate combination anticancer therapy may effective drug overcome MDR . In study start dose 2.5 microgram/m2 . Normally 1/6 No-observed-adverse-effect level ( NOAEL ) dose-level monkey would choose first dose-level , however decide start 25 % dose-level . Across specie ( mouse , rat Cynomolgus monkey ) rise transaminases drop platelet occur 30 microgram/m2 . The Nadir toxicity occur within 6 hour full recovery day 5 bolus injection . At first occurrence non-reversible ( within 1 week ) Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) v3.0 Grade 2 liver function toxicity ( Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) /Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase ) , i.e . Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , patient accrual place hold recovery subsequent timing patient accrual exist subsequent cohort re-defined sponsor , principal investigator SENDO . Pharmacokinetic assessment carry patient first , consent patient second cycle treatment . Assessment immunogenicity ( bind and/or neutralize antibody APO010 carry patient cycle treatment dose 2 week final dose .</detailed_description>
