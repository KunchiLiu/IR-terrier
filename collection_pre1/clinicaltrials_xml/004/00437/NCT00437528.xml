	<brief_summary>A novel sensor ( device name sensurine ) develop aim real- time measurement bladder volume . The sensurine device wearable , fully passive , non-invasive compact heat flow sensor ( patent pending ) electronic control unit . The device serve tool manage treat bladder dysfunction ( behavioral treatment ) , overactive bladder without incontinence , urge incontinence void difficulty . In phase I clinical trial sensor unit test technological feasibility demonstration collect design data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Applicability Study Novel Heat Flow Sensor Unit Measuring Urinary Bladder Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Primary objective asses safety physical performance SenseUrine ’ sensor unit validate concept determine bladder volume measure heat flow . The Secondary objective optimize device accuracy Primary endpoint : To show sensor negative effect subject , determine bladder urine volume , base sensor ’ signal , accuracy ±10 % compare actual volume . Secondary endpoint – determine bladder urine volume , accuracy ±10 % , different ambient condition ( temperature clothing ) . Inclusion criterion – All subject age 18-50 , active , good general health without urinary complaint document urinary tract dysfunction . Exclusion criterion – Pregnancy , breast feeding , know allergic sensitivity medical adhesive tape , cognitive incompatibility mental incompetence . On first visit , subject sign inform consent form . A medical intake include demographic data collect . Stage 1 serve basic test sensor unit measure maximal minimal bladder volume . The sensor attach low abdomen wall checked functionality . Each subject fill bladder ( drink water ) sense strong urge void . The subject void empty measurement cup . Ultrasound measurement ( US ) bladder volume , sensor signal read record standard miliVoltmeter immediately empty bladder . Sensor , US cup measurement reading do investigator . Continuing stage 2 depend preliminary result ( sensor reading compare measured volume US reading ) determine feasibility.. Stage 2 serve measure dynamic bladder heat conductivity fill void phase . On 2nd visit subject fill bladder gradually drink 500CC water ( 60-90 minute ) sense strong urge void . The subject drink additional 50-100CC water wait around 10 minute aim achieve maximal bladder capacity . The sensor signal record begin bladder filling stage every 5-10 minute . Then , subject request void control manner intentionally stop urinate empty 50-100CC urine ( voided volume determine measurement cup ) . The controlled voiding 50-100CC repeat bladder empty . The sensor signal read record stage . Visit 3 performed manner different position measurement ( supine-on back , side front , sit , stand ) . Visit 4 ( final visit ) serve demonstrate sensor unit ’ performance different ambient temperature clothing . Two subject randomly select examine sensor ambient 15ºC ( control air-conditioned room external thermometer ) measure dynamic range ( maximal minimal bladder capacity ) . The do room temperature twice- light heavy clothing . The 2 subject randomly select examine sensor 's performance ambient 40ºC ( hot temperature achieve electric heater small room control external thermometer ) measure dynamic range ( maximal minimal bladder capacity ) . The do room temperature twice- light heavy clothing . All output signal log process show correlation calculate heat conductance bladder volume . A table consisting calculate index conductivity vs. bladder volume design . General : 10 subject recruit advertisement notification compensation time travel study site . Every session last 4 hour long . In work day 3-5 subject participate total trial period expect approximately 20 working day .</detailed_description>
