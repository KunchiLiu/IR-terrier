	<brief_summary>Objectives : Ketamine effective , short-acting anesthetic drug , decrease blood pressure . It widely state Ketamine increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , prevents use many emergency situation , specifically patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) increase ICP . Based previous clinical experience , hypothesize Ketamine decrease – rather increase – ICP . Methods : Prospective , control , clinical trial . Children ICP monitoring receive single Ketamine dose ( 1-1.5 mg/kg ) either increased ICP and/or potentially distressing activity . Hemodynamic variable , ICP cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) record 1 minute every minute 10 minute follow Ketamine administration ( Before/after design ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Ketamine effective , safe , rapid , short-acting anesthetic drug , – contrary anesthetic drug - decrease blood pressure . It widely believe Ketamine increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , prevents use many emergency situation , include trauma specifically patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) increase ICP . Based previous clinical experience patient ICP monitoring , Ketamine increase ICP . We therefore hypothesize Ketamine decrease – rather increase – ICP . Methods : Prospective , control , clinical trial perform Pediatric ICU regional trauma center . Children ICP monitoring receive single Ketamine dose ( 1-1.5 mg/kg ) either increased ICP and/or potentially distressing activity . Hemodynamic variable , ICP cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) record 1 minute every minute 10 minute follow Ketamine administration ( before/after study design ) . Parents/guardian patient inform ask sign inform consent .</detailed_description>
