	<brief_summary>The goal study re-evaluate tetanus antibody pharmacokinetic profile Tetanus Immune Globulin ( Human ) ( TIG ) Tetanus vaccine ( Tetanus toxoid ; TT ) give concurrently strict control anatomical location time administration TIG TT . Pharmacokinetic profile antibody titer include duration adequate titer protection provide TIG TT give combination assess use standardized administration regimen standardize antibody assay procedure . This study may provide evidence recommendation World Health Organisation ( WHO ) whereby dual coverage vaccine tetanus hyperimmune would ideally provide best coverage anyone potential develop tetanus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tetanus Immunization Subjects With No Immunization History With Tetanus Antibody Levels Below Protective Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , single-center trial include single group subject know primary immunization history TT &gt; 10 year pass since last dose tetanus contain vaccine receive . The study enroll six subject would receive dT TIG concurrently Day 1 . All dosed subject follow 40 day Day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 30 40 time level tetanus antibody measure order determine serum level vs. time curve , Cmax , Tmax , duration protective antibody level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 90 year . Signed write informed consent prior initiation studyrelated procedure . No known primary immunization history TT/dT &gt; 10 year pass since last dose tetanus contain vaccine receive . Subjects unknown uncertain previous vaccination history consider previous tetanus toxoid dos . Subjects military service since 1941 consider 1 dose tetanus vaccine . Subjects must document tetanus antibody level nonprotective level ( &lt; 0.15 IU/ml ) . Subjects must free present wound wound infection History suspicion significant allergic reaction intravenous immune globulin , blood product A history selective IgA deficiency ( serum level &lt; 5.0 mg/dL ) know antibody IgA Congestive heart failure ( New York Association stage great Class II ) Conditions whose symptom effect could alter protein catabolism and/or IgG utilization ( e.g . proteinlosing enteropathy , nephrotic syndrome ) Women child bear potential practice adequate contraception ( i.e . chemical mechanical method ) pregnant lactate female Subjects severe thrombocytopenia coagulation disorder would contraindicate intramuscular injection TIG therapy within previous six month Investigational drug therapy within previous three month History Thromboembolism</criteria>
