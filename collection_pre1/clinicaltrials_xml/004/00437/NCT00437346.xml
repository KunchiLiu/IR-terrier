	<brief_summary>Study title : Functional dyspepsia -- effect acid reduce treatment individualize information . Summary : 15-20 % people experience dyspepsia year . Dyspepsia mean pain discomfort upper part abdomen . Accompanying symptom esophagus may present . The important relevant medical examination gastroscopy , finding normal condition usually classify functional dyspepsia . Several disturbance function know potential cause symptom , optimal choice treatment may vary . In study investigator plan examine whether different type functional disturbance respond differently medical therapy . In particular , investigator want ass whether comprehensive individualize information influence result therapy . This previously study systematically . The investigator also postulate disturbance function esophagus may cause complaint classified functional dyspepsia even symptoms atypical . Few study do evaluate hypothesis , may potential consequence choice appropriate treatment . In animal model human recently demonstrate elevated gastric pH anti-ulcer treatment trigger food allergy . We use proton pump inhibitor study eventually development food allergy influence patient 's condition observation period . That 're observe IgE dynamic study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Dyspepsia - Effect Acid-Reducing Treatment Information .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Functional dyspepsia common disorder affect approximately 25 % adult population . Functional dyspepsia define symptom accord Rome II criterion . A normal upper endoscopy also warrant Many patient specific motility disorder . A accurate diagnosis could mean effective treatment . In study patient take several test order make specific diagnosis . These include : 24 hour pH-monitoring , oesophagusmanometry , drink test scintigrafy . We study effect acid reduce treatment ( proton pump inhibitor ) different dysmotility-types also effect medical information advise . We observe concentration total IgE various specific antibody food allergen serum take PPI . Results vary dependent whether patient use PPI anytime . Patients The patient include via referral general practitioner hospital doctor . An upper endoscopy perform . If investigation normal patient consider inclusion study . Criteria inclusion - Age 20 - 60 year - Rome II criterion fulfil - Helicobacter test negative ( urease-test ) - Informed consent Criteria exclusion - Diabetes - Prior gastrointestinal surgery - Treatment proton pump inhibitor / H2 blocker last 30 day - Pregnancy / lactation - Current use NSAIDs - Serious psychiatric illness - Serious egg-allergy Study design Start study : symptom score base symptom within last three day . Lanzo melt 30 mg daily give morning dose . Patients randomize two group . Group A give thorough information base test take plus medical treatment . Group B receive medical treatment . After two week symptom score per telephone . After four week new symptom score . A reduction least 25 % define treatment response . These patient continue medical treatment three month . Now patient receive thorough information . Non responder end medical treatment follow medical information advise next three month . After eight week symptom score per telephone . After 12 week symptom score per telephone . After 16 week study end . Symptom score take . After 4 16 week patient evaluate his/her treatment five category : Very satisfied , satisfied , less satisfied , change , bad . Symptom score Seven symptom score 1-7 point base last week . The symptom : regurgitation , nausea , early satiety , belching , pain refer meal , pain refer meal , postprandial fullness . 1 . No symptoms 2 . Insignificant symptom ( usual ignore ) 3 . Light symptom ( easy ignore ) 4 . Moderate symptom ( easy tolerate ) 5 . Quite marked symptom ( easy tolerate ) 6 . Marked symptom ( affect daily activity ) 7 . Substantional symptom ( ca n't daily activity ) 24 hour pH monitor Digitrapper III Synectics use . A probe instal trans nasally gastric lumen pH value register . Afterwards probe place five cm upper border lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) . After 24 hour registration complete analyzed use Polygram 98 Medtronic Functional Diagnostics AS . Total reflux index , reflux meal , postprandial reflux , nightly reflux long reflux episode register . Pathologic reflux index define pathological reflux 5 % . Acid Clearence Time ( ACT ) also estimate . It find divide total reflux time number reflux . Upper normal limit set 0,85 minutes/reflux . Esophagusmanometry We use perfusion manometry . The catheter sensor five level five cm apart . LES first localize length resting pressure register . We test normal relaxation swallow . Then test motility ( peristalsis amplitude/duration pressure wave ) . Scintigraphy We give standard meal compose two omelet , one slice bread glass water . Radioactive Technesium inject omelet meal eaten ten minute . Picture uptakes take accord protocol first hour completion meal . Gastric empty time estimate . Drink test The patient drink water 150 ml/min feel must stop . Symptoms register stop 15 30 minute . This test determine accommodation visceral sensibility . Blood test Hemoglobin , sedimentation rate , CRP , leucocytes , thrombocyte , bilirubin , ALP , ALAT , g-GT , albumin amylase take exclude organic disease . It represent variable study design .</detailed_description>
