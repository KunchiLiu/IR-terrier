	<brief_summary>This type study call `` Phase I study '' . Its purpose determine side effect two medicine list study give together whole brain radiation , high dose valproic acid give together temozolomide whole brain radiation . We also study drug combination 's effectiveness treating cancer . While drug whole brain radiation use people many year , never combine purpose treat patient cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Temozolomide , Valproic Acid Radiation Therapy Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At start study , patient inform dose level treat . On day 1 , patient physical exam several blood draw include draws measure level valproic acid body . Patients start whole brain radiation also time start valproic acid temozolomide pill . Patients ask take valproic acid pill every 12 hour temozolomide pill daily . Patients need come center need come center receive whole brain radiation 3 week ( weekday , exclude holiday ) . Radiation therapy administer weekend patient still take pill whole 3 week start radiation . Patients come back study visit weekly 6 month . Two visit also require : approximately 6 week 10 week start treatment . Patients ask old new symptom determine adjustment pill dose require . Every study visit except last one include blood draw . These evaluate blood count , blood chemistry also measure level valproic acid body . The Mini Mental Status examination describe repeat every visit .</detailed_description>
