	<detailed_description>We previously demonstrate high-frequency ultrasound spectroscopy , recently conventional-frequency ultrasound spectroscopy may use detect cell death vitro , situ vivo . The method detect different form cell death demonstrate sensitive apoptotic , necrotic mitotic cell death . The objective study evaluate use ultrasound image spectroscopy predictive marker advance tumour response combine chemotherapy radiotherapy . Since neoadjuvant treatment may also act tumour vasculature `` normalize '' also evaluate blood-vessel imaging standard Doppler-imaging standard higher-resolution image use clinically approve microbubble contrast agent . The main goal , describe , select best ultrasound spectroscopy parameter use early predictor pathological complete response . Specifically , primary endpoint correlate change ultrasound backscatter parameter obtain throughout course treatment pathological complete , partial , complete partial response . We ultimately hope able generate Receiver-Operator-Curve parameter beyond pilot investigation . The ultrasound-spectroscopy parameter examine include mid-band fit , spectral-slope histogram-distribution-fit parameter related scatterer size concentration . From various receiver-operator curve best ultrasound parameter predict response select aid define clinical specificity sensitivity technique . The secondary endpoint study include examine change size tumour , also measure use conventional gold-standard B-scan ultrasound imaging ( length width height addition volume ) correlate spectroscopic ultrasound change determine different time patient treatment . Other secondary endpoint include measure change blood vessel distribution standard Doppler-imaging standard microbubble contrast agent image . As another secondary endpoint also correlate ultrasound change 2 5-year long-term clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
