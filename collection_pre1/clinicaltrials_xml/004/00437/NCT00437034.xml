	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety efficacy VEGF Trap ( aflibercept ) patient relapsed refractory , stage II III multiple myeloma ( MM ) . II . To perform correlative study order evaluate angiogenic property tissue patient course treatment VEGF Trap . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive aflibercept intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 60 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
