	<detailed_description>Hyperglycaemia associate increased morbidity mortality patient admit hospital acute critical illness , myocardial infarction stroke . Moreover patient hyperglycaemia significantly long hospital stay , high rate ICU admission , increase in-hospital mortality likely require transfer nursing home . Recently , interventional study link reversal hyperglycaemia well clinical outcome especially acute myocardial infarction , cardiac surgery critically ill patient . In England Wales , estimate number people COPD approach 1.5 million . The morbidity economic cost associate condition extremely high approximately 10 % acute medical admission cause exacerbation underlying condition . As corollary 15 % patient COPD need admission hospital year . Acute hyperglycaemia common among patient admit acute exacerbation COPD . The reason likely multi-factorial include association COPD increase risk develop diabetes least woman , elderly nature two population use glucocorticoid markedly increase risk hyperglycaemia . Admission hyperglycaemia ( &gt; 11 mmol/l ) also appear predict increase morbidity patient COPD admit intensive care . The trial randomise trial comparison usual treatment v intensive insulin treatment patient COPD may may diabetes . Patients take part trial first 5 day hospital stay .</detailed_description>
