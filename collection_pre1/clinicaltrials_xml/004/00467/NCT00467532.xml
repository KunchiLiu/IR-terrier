	<brief_title>Effect Burn Size Cytomegalovirus Reactivation Correlates T Cell Immune Function Burned Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study learn infection immune system people suffer burn injury . The immune system change burn injury infection one common complication . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) virus people expose early life ; expose lay inactive body forever . When immune system suppress , virus reactivate . We would like measure virus make copy blood stream people burn injury look cell marker immune system . This study involve baseline weekly blood draw approximately 8 week . If blood test show CMV infection , monitor blood work may need eight week .</detailed_description>
