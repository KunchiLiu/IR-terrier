	<brief_title>Developing Objective Measures Levodopa Induced Dyskinesia : ( Study 1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levodopa induce dyskinesia ( LID ) major problem associate chronic use levodopa ( LD ) symptomatic treatment Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . LD remain potent therapy nearly PD patient use . A substantial portion experience LID , impact range non-interfering severely disable . The objective study develop reliable sensitive objective measure LID quantify muscular control postural stability subject dyskinesia . While `` gold standard '' measure LID subjective RS , determine objective biochemical device equal reliability validity CRS . We hypothesize force plate technology quantify postural sway movement best , pinch-grip best quantify muscle overflow force voluntary movement . We compare two biomechanical device traditional clinical rating scale ( CRS ) . Once biomechanical instrument measure LID set voluntary muscle activity , acquire LID data related postural sway.. A cross-section LD-treated patient without clinically apparent dyskinesia use assess measure . 32 subject invited participate , 24 PD 8 age-matched control ( likely unaffected spouse ) without neurologic disease . Of PD patient 7 clinically apparent dyskinesia , 7 mild dyskinesia 7 moderate severe dyskinesia recruit ( 3 additional subject include account miss data drop-outs ) . They comfortably stand foot place preset mark stance force plate either without mental task pick pinch-grip device multiple time . Testing do effective motor `` '' `` '' state establish validity reliability instrument data , state often reflect usual clinical experience patient . The second method rating dyskinesia Clinical Rating Scale . Subjects rat stand force plate mental task non-mental task condition . All subject undergo test . Healthy subject undergo test three time one visit . Subjects PD admit overnight , seven test period vary number time procedures do . Inpatient subject also receive 1mg/kg/hr 1.5mg/kg/hr intravenous levodopa depend everyday usage levodopa levodopa equivalent medication 2 hour ( 9AM - 11AM ) carbidopa 25 mg po 8AM , 10AM noon prevent nausea .</detailed_description>
