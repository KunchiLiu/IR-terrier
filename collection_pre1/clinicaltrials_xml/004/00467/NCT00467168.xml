	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular complication lead cause death among type 2 diabetic patient . Postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein ( ppTRLs ) atherogenic . Dietary fatty acid quality , , dietary fatty acid composition relate atherogenesis . However , date , overall influence dietary fatty acid composition lipids different subfractions ppTRLs still remain unknown among Chinese diabetic patient . This paucity evidence may limit establishment optimal recommendation dietary fatty acid composition type 2 diabetes . We 2 hypothesis : 1 . Different dietary fatty acid composition lead differential overall response lipids four subfractions ppTRLs postprandial 6 h. 2 . One dietary fatty acid composition identify anti-atherogenesis future study improve atherogenic ppTRLs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Dietary Fat Pattern Prevent Cardiovascular Disease Among Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis lead cause death disability among patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . These patient characteristically hypertriglyceridemia , high VLDL low HDL-cholesterol fasting status . During day-time hour , individual postprandial state composition postprandial lipoprotein may play important role metabolic outcome fasting level . Postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein ( ppTRLs ) atherogenic , long residence time high concentration chylomicron VLDL remnant circulation significant predictor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Abnormal postprandial lipemia highly prevalent diabetic patient , even individual normal fast triglyceride concentration . It suggest diabetes mellitus associate decreased catabolism chylomicron remnant , prolong residence chylomicron VLDL remnants circulation . Therefore , diet favorable effect ppTRLs useful prevent atherosclerosis among type 2 diabetes patient . It well know dietary saturate fatty acid ( SFA ) increase risk CHD monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) decrease risk CHD via modification fast lipid . Since dietary source fat compose combination SFA , MUFA nad PUFA , best characterize dietary fat ratio SFA : MUFA : PUFA . In fact , SFA : MUFA : PUFA ratio give region population relatively homogeneous due common food source , food accessibility , food preparation processing , dietary culture tradition . For example , dietary fatty acid composition ( SFA : MUFA : PUFA ) obtain directly derive exist national/regional report : 1:1.7:0.4 Greece,1:1.0:0.5 USA , 1:1.5:1 mainland China . Our research show composition 1:1.7:1.2 among type 2 diabetic patient Guangzhou , city Southern China ( 10 ) . To date , overall influence dietary fatty acid composition lipids different subfractions ppTRLs still remain unclear . This paucity evidence may limit establishment optimal recommendation dietary fatty acid composition type 2 diabetes . We design three fat load specific fatty acid composition base previous study current nutrition knowledge , aim elucidate influence dietary fatty acid composition overall response lipid ppTRLs postprandial 6 h.Based result , identify one dietary fatty acid composition , improve atherogenic ppTRLs thus may recommend diabetic patient , future large-scale research .</detailed_description>
