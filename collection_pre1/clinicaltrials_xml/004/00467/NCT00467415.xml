	<brief_summary>The investigator study effect 12-week exercise program , consist either : 1 . Walking treadmill partial body weight 2 . Functional exercise program The investigator would like know effect two exercise program quality life , muscle strength control , coordination , walking , functional movement child cerebral palsy marginal ambulators . This randomize control trial subject randomly assign one 2 groups.Subjects group see twice day two week hospital intervention parent training , participate 10 week home-based program . During subject 's two-week clinic-based training , parent caregiver train home program exercise and/or equipment usage . This person must able safely perform exercise program child . Each subject also need participate three separate 5-hour long data collection session schedule 4 month study period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supported Speed Treadmill Training Exercise Program ( SSTTEP ) Marginally Ambulatory Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project propose answer follow question : Is partial body weight support treadmill gait training ( PBWSTT ) effective improve ambulation ability , neuromuscular impairment , functional mobility , disability , quality life marginally ambulatory child cerebral palsy . Specific Aim 1 : Assess effect PBWSTT locomotor training intervention quality life , treatment expectation , self-efficacy , activity participation child CP limit ambulation skill . We hypothesize comparison control group , 12 week locomotor intervention , child CP ( intervention group ) limit ambulation skill demonstrate great improvement score common questionnaire compare control group . Specific Aim 2 : Assess effect PBWSTT locomotor train intervention gross motor skill ; physical function ; biomechanics coordination dynamic ambulation ; physical activity ambulatory child CP . We hypothesize comparison control group , 12 week PBWSTT locomotor training intervention child CP limit ambulation skill demonstrate great improvement functional test score compare control group . Specific Aim 3 : Assess effect PBWSTT locomotor train intervention measure body structure function include : spasticity ; muscle strength ; joint-specific motor control . We hypothesize comparison control group , 12 week PBWSTT locomotor training intervention child CP limit ambulation skill demonstrate great improvement : muscle strength , spasticity joint specific motor control compare control group . This single blind , randomize , control pre-test/post-test study design . Sixty six ambulatory child age 6-12 year age cerebral palsy undergo 12-week training program . Thirty three child undergo Supported Speed Treadmill Training Exercise Program ( SSTTEP ) , remain 33 child receive amount conventional physical therapy form personalize home exercise program serve control group . Three set measure obtain : A1 ) baseline prior intervention ; A2 ) end 12-week intervention period ; A3 ) 4 week intervention end . The two primary aim study assess efficacy SSTTEP improve quality life , functional ambulation , energy expenditure , gross motor skill , muscle strength tone ; ass efficacy SSTTEP improve coordination step ambulation child CP . The intervention group undergo program 10 hour intensive SSTTEP train 14 day period . After initial training , subject participate home program 30 minutes/5 time per week additional 10 week . The control group undergo personalize exercise program consist 10 hour intensive train 14 day period . After initial training , subject participate home program 30 minutes/5 time per week additional 10 week .</detailed_description>
