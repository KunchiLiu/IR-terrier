	<brief_title>Study Combination Cyanoacrylate Surgical Solutions Reducing Skin Flora Contamination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CDC state two source surgical site infection ( SSI ) pathogens- endogenous exogenous . The endogenous flora patient 's skin , mucous membrane , hollow viscera source pathogens SSIs . In addition know source SSI pathogen , also know risk factor SSI . The risk factor SSIs may patient-related , related preoperative , intra-operative , post-operative surgical treatment care patient . Many know risk factor contribute SSIs include , limited age , nutritional status , co-morbidities , length pre-operative stay , duration operation , preoperative skin prep , surgical technique . In addition , certain surgical procedure risk develop SSI great surgical procedure . While various pre-operative post-operative technique approach prevent infection patient undergo surgery , pre-operative skin care technique , appropriate use antibiotic prophylaxis , use post-operative anti-microbial method , immobilize patient 's endogenous skin flora , opportunity exists reduce rate skin flora contamination lead wound contamination .</detailed_description>
