	<brief_title>Catheter Related - Gram Positive Bloodstream Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>THE STUDY DRUG : Daptomycin antibiotic design treat variety bacterial infection difficult treat . SCREENING TESTS : Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . - You ask medical/surgical history . - You ask medication may take past 2 week . You tell study doctor study staff medication therapy may take study ) - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( heart rate , temperature , breathe rate , blood pressure ) . - You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test check bacterial infection . This routine blood sample may draw CVC , CVC still place . - Your CVC exit site ( CVC remove ) examine . - You may echocardiogram ( test use sound wave make picture heart , help show well heart pump blood ) . This test perform specific type infection ( make sure inflammation line heart ) . Your primary doctor and/or study doctor decide test . If find inflammation , able take part study . - Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . STUDY TREATMENT : If find eligible take part study , give daptomycin vein 30 minute every 24 hour least 7-14 day , depend type bacteria . The CVC either remove , exchange guide wire . The decision remove exchange CVC timing placement CVC decide primary physician willingness remove exchange infected CVC . This do within 96 hour first positive blood culture ( first blood drawn show bacteria ) . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . If study doctor and/or primary doctor suspect mixed infection ( 2 certain type bacteria ) pneumonia , also treat different type antibiotic , vein mouth , combination study drug . These antibiotic may include aztreonam , cefepime , imipenem , meropenem , ciprofloxacin hydrochloride , bactrim , and/or amoxicillin/clavulanate ( combination antibiotic ) . If discharge hospital complete study medication , arrangement make provide infusion outpatient basis ( nurse , , family member ) . You and/or family member taught ( nurse ) take study medication home . Before discharged hospital , receive kit include enough supply and/or family member give daptomycin vein . If medication give home , prescription give pick medication pharmacy discharge hospital . If possible , primary doctor may arrange receive medication M. D. Anderson outpatient treatment center , nurse schedule visit home give medication . STUDY TESTS/PROCEDURES : During week treatment , follow exams/procedures perform week . - You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test . It may draw CVC , CVC still place . The CVC exit site examine visit sign symptom infection . - You also blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) blood culture every day long show sign infection . - You ask symptom illness may experience since last visit . LENGTH OF STUDY : Participation study last 60 day ( 2 month ) . You take study infection get bad intolerable side effect occur . END-OF-STUDY VISIT AND FOLLOW-UP VISIT : The end-of-study visit occur within 7 day last dose study drug . The follow-up visit occur 32 day ( 1 month ) last dose study drug . At visit , follow exams/procedures perform . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test check bacterial infection . The blood sample may draw CVC , CVC still place . The CVC exit site examine . - You ask symptom illness may experience since last visit . - You ask medication therapy may take . This investigational study . Daptomycin FDA approve commercially available treatment infection skin soft tissue . Its use study investigational authorize use research . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male nonpregnant , nonlactating female age great equal 18 year . The suspected culprit exchangeable central venous catheter ( CVC ) tunnel nontunnel ( include port PICC ) antibiotic nonantibiotic coat catheter insert subclavian , jugular , peripheral femoral vein . Patients must least two sign sepsis list , combination , within 48 hour prior Daptomycin therapy source bacteremia CVC : . Core temperature =/ &gt; 38.0 degree C =/ &lt; 36.0 degree C , measure orally , rectally , tympanic ally via central catheter . If auxiliary add 0.5 degree C measure temperature ; b.

Systolic blood pressure =/ &lt; 90 mm Hg . Patients probable definite diagnosis uncomplicated CVCrelated gram positive bacteremia include least one positive blood culture CNS , SA , Enterococci , Corynebacterium , Propionibacterium ( If positive blood culture drawn CVC skin flora CNS , Corynebacterium , Propionibacterium , Micrococcus Bacillus , least &gt; 15 colonies/ml require time positive ( DTP ) CVC least 2 hour earlier peripheral culture ) . Signed informed consent . No apparent source clinical manifestation bacteremia catheter ( may local sign symptom catheter site ) . Estimated Serum Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 mL/min ( accord CockGaultformula ) time gram positive bacteremia diagnose unless patient dialysis . Bilirubin &gt; 4x upper limit normal time gram positive bacteremia diagnose . Treatment antibiotic , vancomycin , linezolid , tigecycline daptomycin , effective resistant gram positive bacterial infection , methicillin resistant staphylococci , 48 hour within 72 hour study medication initiation , unless treatment fail defined persistent fever , leukocytosis , and/or repeat positive blood culture ( CVC peripheral ) 72 hour longer appropriate antibiotic treatment Daptomycin . Documented gram positive bacteremia within last 1 month due source CVC . Patients participate another investigational antiinfective study within 30 day . History hypersensitivity lipopeptides . Presence additional source infection organism culture blood , eg . endocarditis ( evidenced vegetation echocardiogram ) , septic thrombosis . Conditions markedly decrease albumin plasma ( &lt; 1.5 g/dl ) , e.g. , cirrhosis , nephritic syndrome , endstage renal disease . Prosthetic valve . Oliguria define urine output &lt; 20 cc/hour average 24 hour . Possible complicated CRBSI persistent bacteremia 48 hour active antimicrobial therapy ( osteomyelitis , endocarditis , septic thrombosis ) . Patients diagnosis pneumonia due S. aureus organism , e.g , S. aureus sputum bronchial culture . CPK &gt; 10X maxnormal asymptomatic patient CPK &gt; 5 maxnormal symptomatic patient .</criteria>
