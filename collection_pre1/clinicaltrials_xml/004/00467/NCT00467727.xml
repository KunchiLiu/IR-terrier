	<brief_title>Visibility Lesion Characteristics With Phase Contrast Mammography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability detect lesion mammography felt benefit use image modality screen breast cancer . Screening mammography proven decrease mortality breast cancer . Radiologists identify abnormal breast tissue form microcalcifications , mass , architectural distortion , asymmetric density careful assessment characteristic type lesion use Breast Imaging Reporting Diagnostic System ( BIRADS ) . BIRADS develop provide standardization report mammographic exam . In screen mammography , possible detect lesion , often detailed diagnostic imaging necessary improve visibility margin edge lesion magnification compression view lesion interest due spatial resolution limitation cause geometric blur edge x-ray mammography . If ability clearly see margin edge lesion possible screen mammography , would potentially decrease overall radiation exposure currently need allow radiologist confident characterization majority patient use x-ray mammography . Digital mammography develop improve visibility lesion primarily dense breast . The reason improved contrast range would allow wider range gray level differentiation digital mammography come spatial resolution limitation blur edge lesion . Phase contrast mammography ( PCM ) develop improve digital mammography provide improvement sharpness edge utilize x-ray property refraction .
