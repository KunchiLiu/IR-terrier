	<brief_title>Treatment Aggression , Anger Emotional Dysregulation Borderline Personality Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD ) disable disorder characterize poor affect regulation poor impulse control . This often result impair interpersonal relationship maladaptive behavioral pattern , include anger dyscontrol , aggression towards others self-destructive behavior . Evidence suggest relatively common disorder , affect 2 % population 1 . In addition , BPD patient frequent psychiatric hospitalization , great use outpatient psychotherapy visit emergency room individual psychiatric disorder 3 , 4 . Due heterogeneity symptom fall DSM-IV definition BPD , productive effort understand underlie neurobiology disorder employ dimensional approach . This application focus domain affective instability alter emotion regulation , believe many core disorder 5 . The emotional dysregulation BPD appear biological vulnerability . This vulnerability include increased emotional reactivity , well impaired capacity employ effortful control modulation emotional reaction . The emotional reactivity manifest high sensitivity emotional stimulus heighten emotional intensity5 may reflect limbic system activity . The impairment emotional modulation result slow return baseline emotional state may reflect deficit prefrontal regulatory region . While data support formulation limit , self-report measure responses various emotional stimulus recently , objective , non-verbal physiological measure include startle eye blink modulation ( SEM ) , use test theory . SEM well-established technique use study psychophysiology emotion show reflect amygdala activation6 . Our research group demonstrate exaggerated affective startle BPD patient compare healthy control subject later probe position response word emotionally negative valence , select specifically target emotion commonly unpleasant BPD patient . Emerging neurobiological theory base preliminary functional neuroimaging study posit BPD hyperarousal-dyscontrol syndrome 4 , implicate dysfunction amygdala activity couple weaken prefrontal inhibitory control . Several neuroimaging study research group help advance idea7 . Building exciting finding expertise available , project use translational approach study treatment effect emotional regulation BPD SEM prediction treatment response functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Dialectical Behavior Therapy empirically validate treatment approach emphasize role emotion regulation treatment suicidal self-destructive behavior BPD8 , 9 . It gain considerable popularity include component APA guideline treatment BPD10 . While approach stress skill technique emotional regulation , encourage cognitive control maladaptive behavioral pattern , neither neuroimaging psychophysiological study effect DBT emotional processing BPD , despite proven efficacy . While neuroimaging psychophysiological study psychotherapeutic treatment do major depression 11 , 12 13 , study do BPD . By examine change affective startle baseline predictor response fMRI blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) activation pattern associate DBT treatment , project aim well characterize nature emotional dysregulation BPD , identify feature predict good response DBT treatment . In addition , project explore relationship clinical improvement BPD symptomatology DBT treatment change neurobiological measure perform follow-up SEM six twelve month DBT treatment . This approach help elucidate neuroanatomy abnormal emotional processing BPD may help identify potential strategy correct deficit .</detailed_description>
