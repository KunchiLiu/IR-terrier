	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth kidney cancer block blood flow tumor block enzyme need cell growth . PEG-interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth kidney cancer . Giving gefitinib together PEG-interferon alfa-2b may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gefitinib together PEG-interferon alfa-2b work treat patient unresectable metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat gefitinib PEG-interferon alfa-2b . Secondary - Determine response rate ( RECIST criterion ) , duration response , time treatment failure , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Assess toxicity tolerability regimen patient . - Determine pre-treatment expression von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) protein , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , p27 , correlate response treatment . - Determine post-treatment alteration EGFR p27 expression patient tumor accessible serial biopsy . - Assess change EGFR level buccal epithelial cell patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously weekly week 1-6 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients partial response stable disease completion course 2 continue receive gefitinib alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 39 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
