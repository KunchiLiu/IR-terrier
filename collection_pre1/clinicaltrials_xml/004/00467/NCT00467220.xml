	<brief_title>Effect Daily Calorie Alternate-day Calorie Reductions Risk Cardiovascular Disease Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight individual great risk certain chronic disease cardiovascular disease cancer compare normal weight . Dietary restriction show low risk chronic disease overweight human subject well normal weight rodent . The majority study examine dietary restriction protocols rodent human implement daily calorie restriction ( CR ) , i.e . amount energy consume decreased certain percentage every day . Another dietary restriction regimen employ , although less commonly , intermittent caloric restriction , alternate-day fasting ( ADF ) , i.e . food available ad-librium every day , alternate partial complete caloric restriction day . Recent finding suggest ADF may modulate certain index disease risk similar extent daily CR animal model . The effect ADF regimens comparison CR regimens disease risk yet perform human subject , however . ADF protocol need result weight loss , would therefore appropriate non-obese individual . Accumulating evidence suggest adipose tissue may play role modulate chronic disease risk release substrate , fatty acid , variety hormone , include adiponectin leptin . The effect ADF CR adipose tissue metabolism hormone release remain unclear . Accordingly , aim present study compare ADF regime CR effect risk factor cardiovascular disease cancer effect adipose tissue metabolism hormone secretion , normal weight modestly overweight ( BMI 22-27 kg/m2 ) human subject .</detailed_description>
