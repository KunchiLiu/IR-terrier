	<brief_summary>This Phase II , open-label clinical trial examine role Panhematin® patient MDS . The objective study evaluate safety efficacy Panhematin® ( hematin injection ) treatment adult patient ( ≥ 18 year age ) low-risk MDS . The study conduct outpatient basis consist follow : - A Screening Period ( within 28 day Day 1 ) - Screening bone marrow aspiration biopsy 60 day prior receive study medication - An 8-week Treatment Period ( Days 1 4 Week 1 , weekly visit Weeks 2 8 ) ; partial complete responder three cell line may continue treatment additional 4 week - A 6-month Post treatment Follow-up Period ( monthly clinic visit Weeks 12 40 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 , Open-Label , Multi-Dose Study Panhematin Patients With MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , diverse group hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) disorder , characterize ineffective hematopoiesis manifest clinically anemia , neutropenia , and/or thrombocytopenia . MDS frequently observe elderly population ( median age 60 70 year ) male predominance . The incidence MDS vary 2.1 12.6 case per 100,000 people per year , estimate prevalence 55,000 patient United States [ Catenacci , 2005 ; Williamson , 1994 ; Aul , 1998 ; Aul , 2001 ] . Patients MDS frequently present symptom fatigue , pallor , exertional dyspnea , infection , bleed bruise [ Catenacci , 2005 ] . MDS divide 2 major subtypes : indolent ( early ) MDS , pro-apoptotic force predominate , aggressive ( advanced ) MDS , pro-proliferative factor common . The curative therapy MDS allogeneic transplantation [ Catenacci , 2005 ; Thompson , 2005 ] . Curative treatment restrict young , healthy individual histocompatible-matched donor able undergo intensive chemotherapeutic regimen [ Catenacci , 2005 ] . Recently , FDA approve 3 agent treatment disease , Vidaza , Dacogen , revlimid . The latter approve subset patient MDS del 5q abnormality , former two applicable high risk disease . Rhu-EPO currently available patient low risk MDS however , fail , option limit agent mention , significant myelotoxic effect . Effective less myelosuppressive treatment low-risk MDS need . We propose novel approach treatment patient low-risk MDS use heme supplementation Panhematin® ( hemin injection ) . Panhematin® iron-containing metalloporphyrin , indicated amelioration recurrent attack acute intermittent porphyria ; act limit hepatic and/or marrow synthesis porphyrin , presumably , result inhibition aminolevulinic acid synthetase ( enzyme limit rate porphyrin/heme biosynthetic pathway ) [ Panhematin® Product Prescribing Information ] . There pre-clinical clinical data suggest heme supplementation Panhematin® ( hematin injection ) potential treatment option patient MDS . Preliminary data indicate hemin administration potential stimulate progenitor cell growth , stimulate globin synthesis , elevate overall hemoglobin level . Panhematin® proven well tolerate use therapeutically patient acute intermittent porphyria , anticipate well tolerated patient population . For study , select patient low intermediate 1 risk disease IPSS , standard care MDS ( supportive therapy ) administer need . Measurement serum porphyrin level Hgb F do baseline week 8 .</detailed_description>
