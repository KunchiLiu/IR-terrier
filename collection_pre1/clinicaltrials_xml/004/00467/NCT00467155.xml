	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine Helicobacter pylorus bacteria stomach fluids child hospitalize receive nutritional care via nasogastric feeding ( tube nose stomach ) treat malnutrition . The H. pylorus strain Gambian child may differ genetically strain find stomachs adult community . The fluid sample examine H. pylorus bacterial infection may make child sick unable absorb food . Ninety hospitalize Gambian child , less 2 year age , require nasogastric feed tube stomach fluid sample take via gastric tube . Thirty mother child positive H. pylorus bacteria provide sample stomach fluid . This study may help develop treatment heal stomach improve child growth . This study conduct Medical Research Council Great Britain Research Laboratories Clinical Facility Fajara .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This preliminary descriptive study aim provide first data evaluate difference similarity genotype isolates H. pylorus obtain child adult live The Gambia , West Africa , assess likely magnitude difference . This protocol describe application minimally invasive technique H. pylorus isolation ( develop first part project describe separate protocol , DMID protocol 06-0053 ) population study . Study subject resident The Gambia , West Africa . Ninety child , age less 2 year , require therapeutic nasogastric intubation 30 healthy mother child study . Subjects study Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Great Britain Research Laboratories Clinical Facility Fajara , The Gambia , West Africa . Investigators propose transition childhood colonization adult disease state affect multiple factor include evolution genotype colonize H. pylorus strain , drive part host response infection . Researchers hypothesize H. pylorus strain Gambian child differ genetically strain chronically colonize adult community . The investigator ' genetic phenotypic characterization pediatric adult isolates test fundamental difference strain circulate 2 age group , may help evaluate importance strain selection and/or genome evolution high risk society . The specific aim study ass relatedness child strain close adult relative . Study procedure include aspirate gastric juice nasogastric tube use infant feeding purpose child undergo intensive in-patient re-nutrition , culture H. pylorus aspirate , also parent accept invitation donate sample gastric juice culture nasogastric tube insert temporarily purpose . Most genotyping entail arbitrarily prim polymerase chain reaction DNA fingerprinting , limited ( focus ) DNA sequencing , especially case isolates closely related non-identical fingerprint , metronidazole susceptibility test . Genetic phenotypic characterization pediatric adult isolates test fundamental difference strain circulate two age group , thereby help evaluate importance strain selection and/or genome evolution high risk society . Subjects study 2-year project . If H. pylori isolate gastric aspirate , mother child ask would agree nasogastric tube pass one occasion obtain aspirate gastric juice H. pylori culture . The isolates obtain subject DNA analysis genotyping . Specific point address comparative study include direct comparison strain isolated child adult within family village . This first study perform society high early incidence naturally acquire H. pylorus colonization , allow direct comparison isolate child adult within family village environment , provide information intra-familial intra-community transmission infection . The main outcome measure degree relatedness bacterial isolates . This assessed visual comparison random amplification polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) result , comparison genotype alleles interest , definitively sequence housekeep gene construct phylogenetic tree relatedness use STAR program multiple locus sequence typing ( MLST ) database . There outcome measure human subject .</detailed_description>
