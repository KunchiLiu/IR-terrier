	<detailed_description>Nutritional deficiency major problem school child India variety adverse effect cognitive development growth , increase susceptibility infection . There strong evidence beneficial effect iodine , iron protein-energy cognitive development child , evidence vitamin B6 , vitamin B12 , folate , zinc , omega-3 fatty acid particular docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) limit inconclusive . The present study investigate efficacy food fortify omega-3 fatty acid include DHA micronutrient mix ( iodine , iron , vitamin B2 , vitamin B6 , vitamin B12 , folate , zinc , calcium , vitamin A , vitamin C vitamin E ) improve cognitive development performance school child India . The study follow randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial design child age 7-9 year randomise one four treatment group prospectively follow period twelve month assess cognitive development performance select outcome variable growth , morbidity immune response . Intervention take place primary school , child receive three intervention product daily . The product contain omega-3 fatty acid micronutrient , micronutrient , omega3 fatty acid placebo . At baseline , 6 12 month cognitive test administer blood sample draw assess nutritional status immune response hepatitis B vaccination . Compliance measure daily morbidity monitor weekly mean questionnaire . Anthropometric measurement carry monthly . It expect , 12 month intervention , child consume product contain omega-3 fatty acid micronutrient statistically significant high score higher improvement score cognitive test , grow taller well immune response child consume control product .</detailed_description>
