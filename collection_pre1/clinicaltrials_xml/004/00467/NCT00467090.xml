	<brief_summary>This study identify symptom characteristic Parkinson disease may associate change gene call leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) . Changes gene find patient without family history Parkinson disease . This study examine people Parkinson disease try identify symptom develop time . First-degree relative patient also study . People 18 year age old Parkinson disease people first-degree relative Parkinson disease may eligible study . Participants visit NIH Clinical Center every year 10 year procedure list . Each visit require 3-4 day test , may do inpatient outpatient basis . Telephone interview conduct alternate year . - History physical examination . - Smell testing : Subjects ask identify 40 different scent . - Sensory testing : Objects groove ridge touch subject fingertip . With eye close , subject ask say way groove ridge run object . - Neuropsychological evaluation : Subjects ask memory thinking may ask complete pen paper test . - Psychiatric evaluation : Subjects ask psychiatric symptom , include anxiety depression . - Blood drawing : Blood drawn needle arm . - Magnetic imaging resonance ( MRI ) scan brain : MRI us strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . During test , subject lie table slide MRI scanner ( metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field ) . The procedure last 30 minute , subject may ask lie still 5 minute time . - Transcranial sonography ( TCS ) : TCS us sound wave obtain image brain . Subjects lie back ultrasound device move around scalp . - Sleep study ( 1-2 night hospital admission ) : Subjects brain wave record sleep use electroencephalography ( EEG ) . Their breathing rate , pulse oxygen level also monitor . - Questionnaire : Subjects complete several questionnaire design obtain information symptom trait report associated Parkinson disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics Parkinson Disease Associated With LRRK-2 Gene Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson disease common neurological condition originally think develop environmental factor . More recently , genetic factor implicate . In study , interested study phenotypic presentation patient Parkinson disease due specific defect gene call Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 gene ( LRRK2 ) find patient Parkinson disease . In addition , plan study family member whose genetic status unknown develop pre-clinical description Parkinson disease progression . OBJECTIVE : 1 . To develop pre-clinical description first-degree family member patient Parkinson disease LRRK2 mutation . The first-degree relative may may carry LRRK2 mutation . 2 . To phenotypically characterize Parkinson disease patient LRRK2 mutation . STUDY POPULATION : 200 adult subject include : 1 . Patients diagnosis PD due LRRK2 mutation 2 . First degree family member patient PD LRRK2 mutation . DESIGN : This longitudinal prospective natural history study . OUTCOME MEASURES : 1 . Pre-clinical sign disease first degree relative Parkinson disease patient LRRK2 mutation . 2 . Characterization pre-clinical phenotype first degree relative LRRK2 positive Parkinson disease patient . 3 . Progression Parkinson disease patient LRRK2 mutation . 4 . Genotypic characterization first-degree relatives 5 . RNA expression profile determination compare mutation carrier non-mutation carrier search early biomarkers</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects least 18 year age . 2 . Ability provide consent appoint Durable Power Attorney able provide consent . 3 . Patients diagnosis PD know LRRK2 mutation . OR 4 . First degree relative without diagnosis PD family history suggestive inherit PD due LRRK2 mutation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects history severe head injury , encephalitis , chronic use drug cause parkinsonism clinical history stroke . 2 . For magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , exclusion criterion include follow : pregnancy , pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , dental implant , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment . Patients screen condition prior MRI scan perform .</criteria>
