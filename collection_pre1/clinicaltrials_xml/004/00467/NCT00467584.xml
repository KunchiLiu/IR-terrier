	<brief_title>Aspirin Treatment Multiple Sclerosis-Related Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatigue common symptom multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , affect 90 % people disease . MS-related fatigue disable even feature MS mild . It interfere physical activity , memory thinking , social family activity , ability work . Initial treatment consist energy conservation technique rest period nap approach fail doctor usually recommend trial medication . Amantadine , modafinil , stimulant commonly use help half try . It unlikely drug directly affect cause MS-related fatigue . It difficult develop new drug therapy MS-related fatigue fully understand cause precise way measure . We rely person 's self-report fatigue individual experience report fatigue differently . Recent research show fatigue aspect , difficulty maintain mental concentration ( `` cognitive fatigue '' ) physical activity ( `` motor fatigue '' ) , measure precisely require study . We recently report result study show people take equivalent four regular aspirin tablet ( 1300 mg ) daily reduce MS-related fatigue compare placebo ( sugar pill ) . The current proposal attempt confirm benefit aspirin large group people determine benefit related inflammation . One hundred thirty-five people MS-related fatigue participate MS clinic three Mayo Clinic site . Participants complete questionnaire ask severity impact fatigue , memory test assess cognitive fatigue , blood test measure marker inflammation . At Arizona site , participant also strength test motor laboratory ass motor fatigue . After obtain two separate baseline evaluation , participant randomly assign treatment one-third receive 1300 mg per day aspirin , one-third receive 162 mg per day aspirin one-third receive matching placebo . All participant return clinic two occasion next eight week repeat questionnaire , memory strength testing , blood test , report side-effects . At end study , result one fatigue questionnaire analyze determine aspirin significantly improve fatigue compare placebo . The result questionnaire memory strength test analyzed supportive evidence . If study successful , provide strong scientific evidence aspirin help MS-related fatigue . It add important new option treatment MS patient also familiar , inexpensive , good long-term safety record . At time , allow u good understand cause MS-related fatigue measure precisely . This information extremely useful development therapy future .</detailed_description>
