	<brief_title>The Effects Aspirin Gestation Reproduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite fundamental nature reproduction , many process fraught frustration , inefficiency imperfection , effect severe . Infertility affect 10-15 % couple attempt conceive . Among woman conceive , incidence spontaneous abortion ( SA ) estimate 15 31 % , many case cause unknown . Additionally , four million birth yearly United States , 8 15 % born prematurely experience increase morbidity mortality result . An intervention even small absolute effect outcomes great implication population level due large potential attributable benefit . One potential intervention low-dose acetylsalicylic-acid ( aspirin ) . Aspirin primary target interest anti-inflammatory , vasodilatory platelet aggregation inhibition property . To evaluate effect low-dose aspirin combination folic acid incidence live birth spontaneous abortion , conduct multi-site randomize control trial study two sit one data coordinating center . Women age 18-40 currently try become pregnant single spontaneous abortion past year eligible study . The recruitment goal 1600 woman . Participating woman randomly assign one two treatment group . Those randomized treatment receive daily low-dose aspirin . Those randomized placebo receive daily placebo . Both group receive folic acid daily accordance recommendation U.S. Public Health Service prevention birth defect . The duration treatment regimen ( LDA folic acid placebo folic acid ) 6 menstrual cycle , become pregnant continue end pregnancy . Monthly urine blood sample collect questionnaire administer .</detailed_description>
