	<brief_title>Use EF5 Measure Oxygen Level Tumor Cells Patients Undergoing Surgery Biopsy Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine presence pattern etanidazole derivative EF5 binding tumor , base image cellular analysis , patient undergo surgery biopsy newly diagnose supratentorial malignant glioma . II . Determine level EF5 binding within histologic subtypes tumor patient . Compare relationship hypoxia clinical outcome patient glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) vs non-GBM . III . Determine spatial relationship EF5 bind tumor tissue biomarkers pathophysiologic process ( e.g. , necrosis , proliferation , apoptosis ) patient . IV . Determine relationship EF5 binding Eppendorf needle electrode measurement patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive etanidazole derivative EF5 IV 1-2½ hour within 1-2 day surgical resection biopsy . Tumor tissue , normal tissue , and/or tumor-infiltrated lymph node sample collect surgery stain biological marker . Fluorescent immunohistochemistry technique use determine presence , distribution , level EF5 binding . Patients follow 1 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 48 patient accrue study within 1½-2 year .</detailed_description>
