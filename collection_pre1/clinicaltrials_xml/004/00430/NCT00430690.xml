	<brief_summary>Chronic cocaine administration lead change brain function persist long acute withdrawal phase . The acoustic startle response ( ASR ) well characterize reflexive response sudden acoustic stimulus . The ASR mediate simple 3-synapse subcortical circuit ; modulate part brain area neurotransmitter associate cocaine administration . Our initial study subsequent replication reveals profound diminution ASR cocaine-dependent subject brief period abstinence . Our preliminary finding indicate first degree relative cocaine-dependent subject also reduce startle compare healthy control . The finding low ASR rat human cocaine washout low ASR family member suggest may trait state component startle reduction report . The central objective proposal dissect find regard development persistence early later phase cocaine abstinence human ; ascertain whether startle reduction potential normalization later abstinence predictor clinical course human subject cocaine dependence ; examine whether startle reduction , least part , vulnerability trait development cocaine dependence . This latter Aim carry human test sibling cocaine-dependent subject . Cocaine dependence enormous public health problem . The significance work lie potential ASR reduction serve reliable , easily repeatable biological measure cocaine-induced brain change may enhance outcome prediction tailor treatment may direct patient vulnerable relapse , give restriction resource available substance abuse treatment .</brief_summary>
