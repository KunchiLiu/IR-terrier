	<detailed_description>The aim research gain well understanding factor relate increase health effective functioning old adult . Specifically , efficiency psychomotor performance decline advance age lead profound effect older adult ' quality life . For reason , researcher focus influence individual lifestyle habit age process . One lifestyle choice find positively contribute efficiency old adult ' psychomotor performance cardiovascular exercise . This relationship appear especially significant old adult challenge complex effortful task . Previous research lead investigator believe age specific , rather generalize , impact cognitive functioning . Also , prolong participation cardiovascular exercise find maintain cognitive function critical healthy age . Therefore , purpose research examine role organize 6-month cardiovascular exercise intervention trial electrocortical ( event-related brain potential ) behavioral measure ( reaction time ) executive control . In addition , non-cardiovascular exercise control group participate 6-month stretch tone program use comparison . Participants measure exercise training engagement several task design elicit different executive function ( e.g. , discrimination , task switching , inhibition ) . Each task also contain non-executive condition use comparison examine specificity exercise participation cognitive functioning . A secondary aim project determine effect acute bout exercise cognitive functioning . Both group participate several bout exercise follow immediate measurement task outline determine whether acute exercise beneficial effect executive process . The significance research may include increased understanding factor related amelioration age-related decrement central nervous system function recommendation maintenance cognitive health later stag life .</detailed_description>
