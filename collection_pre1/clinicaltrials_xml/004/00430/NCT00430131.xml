	<brief_summary>This project ( CO-OP II ) second series three study validate new treatment approach child cerebral palsy ( CP ) . The initial study comprise series four single case study child CP . It evaluate potential Cognitive Orientation Occupational Performance ( CO-OP ) approach use child CP test procedure CO-OP II . The overall objective full series study determine whether good functional outcome achieve child CP CO-OP intervention contemporary occupational therapy treatment . The primary objective CO-OP II establish feasibility conduct full scale randomize control trial ( RCT ) discover difference functional outcome ( i.e. , improvement task performance , self efficacy ) group child CP receive CO-OP therapy group receive contemporary treatment approach ( CTA ) . In order meet objective , pilot RCT conduct answer specific research question outline : 1 . Do child wiht CP acquire skill set goal two treatment group ? 2 . Do acquire skill generalize transfer ? 3 . Are skill maintain 4 month post intervention ? 4 . Does CO-OP approach produce large effect skill acquisition self efficacy CTA ? 5 . Does amount parent involvement effect skill acquisition self efficacy ? Completion pilot RCT provide necessary data conduct full study test follow hypothesis : - Children CP receive CO-OP treatment successful child receive CTA improve performance child-chosen skill self efficacy .</brief_summary>
