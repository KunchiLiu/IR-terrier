	<brief_summary>Low low carbohydrate diet , Atkins ' Diet , recently gain attention potential health benefit weight loss gain scientific support grow number study . Benefits note relation raise `` good '' cholesterol , low `` bad '' cholesterol triglyceride . Other study show advantage substitute vegetable fat carbohydrate insulin resistant individual instance type 2 diabetes improvement see `` good '' cholesterol blood sugar . At time , research explore diet contain less processed carbohydrate component combination ( portfolio diet ) similar cholesterol lower effect drug therapy . Therefore wish determine whether cholesterol-lowering component ( portfolio diet ) incorporate low carbohydrate diet especially preserve `` good '' cholesterol lower `` bad '' cholesterol decrease risk heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipoprotein Turnover Low- High-MUFA Portfolio Diets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject undergo two parallel 2-phase treatment . On one treatment , subject place low fat diet one month ( control run-in diet ) second month continue low- fat diet ( i.e . low-MUFA ) addition portfolio component . The order two phase randomize . The treatment similar except background diet portfolio phase high monounsaturated fat ( high-MUFA ) . Subjects allocate randomly either treatment . Diets metabolically control food provide weekly interval . Subjects come 12h overnight fast Risk Factor Modification Center St. Michael 's Hospital Department Nutritional Sciences , University Toronto immediately prior commencement treatment phase weekly interval course study period . Prior start study , subject instruct detail study diet protocol . They also ask maintain constant level physical activity throughout course study . At visit , body weight ( kg ) obtain indoor clothing , without shoe , blood pressure take twice dominant arm subject seat least 20 minute . Height ( cm ) record first visit . Throughout study period , subject maintain diet prescribed initial visit . At every visit treatment phase , subject provide fast blood sample . The kinetic test lipoprotein metabolism perform 4th 8th week study . At baseline last week study phase , 24h urine collection 12h breath hydrogen collection complete . The measurement apolipoprotein vivo kinetics carry use primed-constant infusion [ D3 ] L-leucine . This protocol allow determination kinetics apolipoproteins simultaneously . Kinetics study conduct constantly feed state participant receive 1/30th daily energy requirement every half-hour whole duration test ( 15 hour ) . These method describe detail previous publication group . Briefly , 7am morning study , 12-hour overnight fast , participant admit Toronto General Hospital Clinical Investigation Unit two intravenous catheter ( IV 's ) insert , one forearm vein . One IV infusion stable isotope describe one withdrawal blood sample . After achieve steady state ( 3hrs small half-hourly meal ) , subject first receive bolus injection 10 µmol/kg body weight [ D3 ] L-leucine ( [ D3 ] L-leucine 98 % , C/D/N Isotopes ) dissolve physiological saline ( 0.9 % NaCl ) constant infusion 10 µmol/kg/h [ D3 ] L-leucine 12 hour via intravenous line insert leave forearm vein . Blood sample collect regular interval ( 0 , 1/2 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 12hrs ) . All lipoprotein subfractions separate sequential ultracentrifugation frozen thereafter -80oC process analysis .</detailed_description>
