	<detailed_description>Atiprimod show slow stop growth several human tumor cell line laboratory study . Researchers believe may effect tumor cell patient advanced cancer . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . At screen visit , ask question medical history medication use . You ask question ability carry everyday activity ( performance status ) . You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature ) , routine blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine test , electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . You neurological exam , include series question task ( walk , talk , touch nose ) . The interview take 20 minute complete . Additionally , study doctor test reflex tap arm , knee , bottom foot rubber triangle-shaped end special instrument look like little hammer . The study doctor also test ability sense light touch pinprick , check eye special light source ( ophthalmoscope ) . You ask question physical , social/family , emotional , functional well-being , well additional concern may regard numbness , tingle , discomfort , difficulty may . The interview take 10 minute complete . The tumor measure test normally use check extent disease patient type cancer . This may include x-ray , MRIs , CT scan , bone marrow biopsy . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Women able child must also negative pregnancy test order participate study . If complete screening test eligible participate study , schedule return clinic within 14 day , baseline test start treatment ( Day 1 ) . You ask question medical history medication use since last visit . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , routine blood test ( 1 teaspoon ) . A blood sample ( roughly less half teaspoon ) also draw pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test use measure amount atiprimod blood . This first blood sample `` baseline '' PK sample , drug level later blood sample compare . You assign one 8 specific dose level atiprimod , base enter study ; however , dose level may lower experience increase blood level AST ALT ( liver function test use monitor possible liver inflammation ) . Your assigned dose level decide many tablet capsule atiprimod take dose . The first group 3 patient receive atiprimod tablet lowest dose level 14 day , follow 14 day drug . If serious side effect occur , next 3 patient receive atiprimod capsule low dose level . If serious side effect occur , next 3 patient receive atiprimod capsule next high dose level capsule use rest study ( tablet use first group 3 patient ) . If 1 3 patient experience serious side effect , next 3 patient give dose ( rather next high dose ) evaluate safety dose . If serious side effect occur , next 3 patient receive next high dose . Each new dose level test way , high dose level ( 8th dose level ) reach serious side effect occur , case dose raise high . During study , take dose atiprimod orally ( mouth ) tablet capsule form day 14 day , follow 14 day atiprimod treatment . These 28 day ( 4 week ) make one treatment `` cycle . '' If experience serious side effect force doctor remove study , cancer stable shrink 2 month treatment , eligible continue atiprimod treatment 1 year ( total 12 cycle ) . If experience increase blood level AST ALT , level return normal within 7 day complete treatment cycle , may eligible continue atiprimod treatment , low dose level modify schedule ( atiprimod day 7 day , follow 7 day atiprimod ) . You take atiprimod morning time day . You eat food least 2 hour 2 hour take atiprimod . You drink 1 - 2 glass water ( prefer ) orange juice , soda , tea , coffee 2 hour 2 hour take daily dose atiprimod , may drink water ( prefer ) orange juice , soda , tea , coffee 2-hour period take daily dose atiprimod . After baseline testing , give first dose atiprimod . During first 8 hour first dose atiprimod , watch side effect might occur . You several blood sample take period PK testing . About quarter teaspoon blood drawn 30 minute first dose , 60 minute , 90 minute , 2 hour , 3 hour , 4 hour , 6 hour , 8 hour first dose , total 2 teaspoon blood drawn . After blood collection , go home . You give study diary record medication take much take , well side effect experience . You also ask record type amount beverage consume 2-hour period take atiprimod 2-hour period take atiprimod . You require keep diary date entire participation study , must bring every study visit . You return clinic 24 , 48 , 72 hour first dose ( Study Days 2 , 3 , 4 ) . You ask question medical history medication use since last visit . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , routine blood ( 1 teaspoon ) , ECG . The ECG do Day 2 ( Days 3 4 ) . A blood sample ( less half teaspoon ) drawn PK testing . You give daily dose atiprimod . Before leave clinic Study Day 4 , give enough atiprimod last next visit ( word , Study Day 6 ) . You instruct eat food least 2 hour 2 hour take atiprimod , take atiprimod morning time day . You also instruct drink 1 - 2 glass water ( prefer ) orange juice , soda , tea , coffee 2 hour 2 hour take daily dose atiprimod . You give diary record take atiprimod , type amount beverage consume 2-hour period take atiprimod 2-hour period take atiprimod , medication take , side effect experience . You ask return clinic test week first cycle treatment ( Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 ) . You take atiprimod dos Days 5-14 home instruct , except 2 day period schedule return clinic ( Study Days 7 14 ) . These 2 dos give clinic . Before leave clinic Study Day 7 , give enough atiprimod last next visit ( Study Day 14 ) . During first four weekly visit ( Study Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 ) , several test perform . During visit , ask question medical history medication use since last visit . You ask question dos atiprimod take ( number tablet capsule take dose , time dose take , ate food drank something water , orange juice , soda , tea , coffee 2 hour take study drug , number glass water , orange juice , soda , tea , coffee drink 4-hour period ) .

A single blood collection ( half teaspoon ) also take Day 7 , Day 21 Day 28 visit PK test . At Day 28 visit , also size tumor measure use x-ray , MRIs , CT scan , . Women able child blood pregnancy test . After first cycle , return clinic evaluation month end cycle eligible treatment . If experience serious side effect force doctor remove study , cancer stable shrink 2 month treatment , eligible continue atiprimod treatment 1 year ( total 12 cycle ) . At monthly study visit , give enough atiprimod last next clinic visit ( Week 4 next cycle ) . You give diary record take atiprimod , type amount beverage consume 2-hour period take atiprimod 2-hour period take atiprimod , medication take , side effect experience . During monthly visit , several test perform . You ask question dos atiprimod take . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , routine blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine test , ECG . You neurological exam . You ask question physical , social/family , emotional , functional well-being , well additional concern may regard numbness , tingle , discomfort , difficulty may . A single blood collection ( less half teaspoon ) take PK test . Your tumor measure use kind scan . Women able child blood pregnancy test . If experience increase blood level AST ALT , level return normal within 7 day complete treatment cycle , may eligible continue atiprimod treatment , low dose level modify schedule . If receive modify schedule atiprimod , return clinic additional evaluation Week 2 ( Day 14 ) modify cycle ( addition evaluation end cycle ) . This evaluation include test do monthly visit , except tumor measure pregnancy test . Extra visit , test , and/or procedure may do time research study , doctor think best interest . You take study disease progress , intolerable side effect occur , follow study guideline participation . One month last treatment cycle , return clinic follow-up evaluation . You ask question ability carry everyday activity ( performance status ) . You ask question medical history medication use since last visit .
