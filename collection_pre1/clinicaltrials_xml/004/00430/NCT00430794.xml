	<brief_title>The Efficacy Spironolactone Patients With Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To assess antihypertensive efficacy add spironolactone antihypertensive treatment patient resistant hypertension . Background Rationale : The proportion hypertensive patient meet definition resistant hypertension grow rapidly doctor use combination antihypertensive treatment order reach low target blood pressure . Spironolactone often use specialist clinic patient resistant hypertension although currently license UK use hypertension complicate primary hyperaldosteronism . Uncontrolled study suggest spironolactone effective antihypertensive modern management resistant hypertension could find randomised trial set . In Sheffield Hypertension Clinic spironolactone currently use one drug choice patient resistant hypertension , particularly woman anecdotally often effective . Study method . The study double- blind randomise placebo control trial parallel group design assess addition 25mg spironolactone exist antihypertensive treatment , titrate 50mg necessary 40 patient resistant hypertension ( 20 patient per group ) period 6 week . Resistant hypertension define : blood pressure adequately control ( systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 85 mmHg clinic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ) despite treatment maximum tolerate dose three antihypertensive agent . All patient ' current antihypertensive treatment include thiazide diuretic least one beta-blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin II receptor antagonist . The primary endpoint difference spironolactone placebo group change daytime average systolic blood pressure 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor day 0 day 42 .</detailed_description>
