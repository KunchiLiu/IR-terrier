	<brief_summary>We carry study determine whether Keppra ( drug usually use treat epilepsy ) effective treatment tremor patient Multiple Sclerosis . Tremor one common symptom MS , also one difficult treat . A small previous study indicate Keppra may effective role , need reproduce result many patient reliably confirm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Levetiracetam ( Keppra ) Treatment Tremor Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis common inflammatory demyelinate disease CNS lead cause neurological disability young adult UK ( ~ 90,000 patient ' affect ) . It estimate direct cost National Health Service £300 million/year total cost UK society exceed £1.3 billion/year . The personal cost term disability also high 50 % patient require aid walk wheelchair bound within 16 year disease onset . Recently , attention focus disease modify drug , include b-Interferon , demonstrate significant reduction clinical relapse rate associate dramatic reduction disease activity brain MRI4-7 . However , evidence sustain long term benefit poor . Therefore , symptomatic therapy remain key part patient management . Cerebellar tremor cerebellar gait instability present 70 % chronic MS patient account significant amount clinical morbidity . Cerebellar tremor major therapeutic problem MS since currently effective treatment . To date medical therapy include propranolol , clonazepam , carbamazepine , isoniazid , phenobarbitone , ondansetron , topiramate , gabapentin cannabis study little sustained benefit . More radical surgical treatment include thalamotomy Deep Brain Stimulation also attempt . However , recent pilot study , small number patient , suggest Keppra ( Levetiracetam ) effective treat MS tremor . This study rely upon rather subjective assessment tremor ass patient use quantitative physiological measure . This protocol involve collaboration clinical neurologist , recognised expertise MS , research group establish expertise electrophysiological pharmacological investigation human tremor11 . The protocol describe study , MS patient , design establish whether Keppra ( Levetiracetam ) produce : 1 . Physiologically measurable reduction tremor ; 2 . Subjective qualitative reduction tremor ;</detailed_description>
