	<brief_summary>The safety tolerability hLF 1-11 give multiple dos establish first HSCT recipient risk developing , yet develop , infectious complication due invasive fungal bacterial disease . These patient different healthy volunteer receive myeloablative treatment , arrest haematopoiesis result neutropenia also induce mucosal barrier injury predispose infection , typically occur week transplant . It therefore essential know hLF 1-11 safe well tolerate give neutropenia mucosal barrier injury infection ensue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety hLF1-11 Treatment Infectious Complications Among HSCT Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human lactoferrin ( hLF ) glycoprotein contain 692 amino acid find saliva , milk , tear , body fluid . The peptide represent first cationic domain , i.e . peptide comprise first eleven residue hLF ( referred hLF1-11 ) significantly effective full length protein peptide represent second cationic domain . As antimicrobial peptide , hLF1-11 show poor antimicrobial activity physiological condition vitro , highly effective vivo infection due variety microorganism , include Gram negative Gram positive bacteria fungi . The objective develop hLF1-11 treatment fungal bacterial infection develop neutropenia result myeloablative therapy prepare haematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) formerly refer bone marrow transplant . Rates infection relate morbidity high population , make attractive target test clinically proof-of-principle hLF1-11 provide effective treatment . Subsequently , hLF1-11 developed systemic antifungal agent</detailed_description>
