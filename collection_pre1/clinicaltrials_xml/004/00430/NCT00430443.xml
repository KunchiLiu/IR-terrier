	<detailed_description>This Phase I , multi-center , open-label , dose escalation , MTD study liposomal annamycin child young adult refractory relapse ALL AML . Enrollment occur cohort approximately 3 subject 10 additional subject enrol MTD . The liposomal annamycin dos escalate sequential cohort . Six dose level liposomal annamycin plan : 130 , 160 , 190 , 230 , 280 , 310 mg/m2/day . The initial group 3 subject receive treatment cycle 130 mg/m2/day liposomal annamycin daily 3 consecutive day follow 18 day liposomal annamycin ( i.e. , 1 treatment cycle = 21 day ) . A prophylactic mouthwash use anthracyline-based chemotherapy ( composition describe Test Product , Dose , Mode Administration ) use 4 time day Days 1-4 , one 4 time immediately 1 hour prior liposomal annamycin treatment Days 1 3 , prevent oral mucositis . Anti-allergic pre-medication diphenydramine administer dose liposomal annamycin . Provided subject experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) [ define study drug relate Grade 3 high non-hematologic toxicity use National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v3.0 ] first 21 day ( i.e. , first treatment cycle ) , subsequent group 3 subject receive next high liposomal annamycin dose . However , 1 3 initial subject experience DLT , cohort subject initial dose level expand 6 subject . If least 2 6 subject experience DLT , 3 subject treat next low dose . The MTD define high dose liposomal annamycin few 2 ( cohort 6 ) subject experience DLT . Subsequent dose escalation occur similar fashion . If subject discontinues treatment reason study drug relate adverse event safety fully evaluate , additional subject may enrol ; review case-by-case basis conjunction Sponsor . The dose escalate either MTD identify maximum dose , 310 mg/m2/day , achieve . Ten additional subject enrol MTD good define toxicity well evaluate efficacy MTD . Subjects evaluate start liposomal annamycin treatment first 3 day liposomal annamycin treatment . Subjects evaluate weekly thereafter first cycle treatment ( 1 cycle consist 3 week , 3 consecutive day daily liposomal annamycin treatment follow 18 day liposomal annamycin ) weekly subsequent cycle eligible receive treatment . A follow-up visit conduct 1 2 week final treatment cycle last study drug administration , treatment period prematurely terminate .</detailed_description>
