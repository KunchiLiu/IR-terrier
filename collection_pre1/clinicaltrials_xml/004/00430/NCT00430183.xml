	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , goserelin leuprolide , may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Giving docetaxel leuprolide goserelin surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . It yet know whether give docetaxel leuprolide goserelin surgery effective surgery alone treat patient prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study docetaxel leuprolide goserelin see well work give surgery compare surgery alone treat patient high-risk localized prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With Without Docetaxel Leuprolide Goserelin Treating Patients With High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized trial test whether addition chemohormonal therapy improve PSA-progression free survival patient high risk , clinically-localized prostate cancer . The neoadjuvant approach take since appear high acceptance rate prostate population type therapy several phase II trial demonstrate safety . Multiple chemotherapeutic therapy show efficacy advanced prostate cancer docetaxel become community standard . Many high risk patient initiate LHRH agonist near time diagnosis prostate cancer . In order allow inclusion patient protocol , enhance enrollment maintain compliance therapy , 3 month androgen deprivation therapy prior enrollment permit . This study therefore able test hypothesis target androgen-sensitive chemotherapy- sensitive prostate cancer cell improve outcomes high-risk patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord nomogram-predicted biochemical progression-free survival 5 year ( 0-20.9 % vs 21-39.9 % vs 40-59.9 % v ≥ 60 % ) androgen-deprivation therapy prior randomization ≤ 4 month ( vs yes ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Please see Arms section detail . The primary secondary objective describe . Primary : - To determine whether treatment neoadjuvant docetaxel androgen deprivation therapy prior radical prostatectomy increase rate 3-year biochemical progression-free survival ( bPFS ) compare treatment immediate radical prostatectomy alone high-risk prostate cancer patient . Secondary : - To compare 5-year bPFS rate , bPFS , disease progression , disease-free survival , overall survival patient randomize two arm trial - To determine safety tolerability neoadjuvant docetaxel androgen deprivation therapy prior surgery high-risk patient undergo radical prostatectomy - To compare impact neoadjuvant docetaxel androgen deprivation therapy time clinically apparent local disease recurrence metastatic disease high-risk patient undergo radical prostatectomy clinically localized prostate cancer - To compare impact neoadjuvant docetaxel androgen deprivation therapy relative RP pathologic tumor stage , frequency lymph node metastasis positive margin rate high-risk patient undergo radical prostatectomy clinically localized prostate cancer - To determine change serum testosterone level predict bPFS - To determine prospectively whether PSA double time ( PSADT ) surrogate endpoint time clinical metastasis overall survival Patients follow 15 year post-randomization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic documentation Histologic documentation prostatic adenocarcinoma . Patients small cell , neuroendocrine , transitional cell carcinoma eligible . All eligible patient must know Gleason sum base biopsy TURP time registration . 2 . Clinically localized disease Patients must clinical stage T1T3a radiographic evidence metastatic disease demonstrate : EITHER CT MRI abdomen pelvis , OR endorectal MRI pelvis demonstrate node &gt; 1.5 cm . If one pelvic lymph node ( ) measure &gt; 1.5 cm , negative biopsy require . If one lymph node &gt; 1.5 cm , large accessible node biopsied . AND Negative bone scan ( plain film and/or MRI and/or CT scan confirmation , necessary ) . Positive PET Prostascint scan consider proof metastatic disease . 3 . Determination highrisk status : Patients must either : A Kattan nomogram predict probability free biochemical progression 5 year surgery &lt; 60 % . OR Prostate biopsy Gleason sum ≥ 8 ( NOTE : The Kattan nomogram probability must calculate patient , include eligible base Gleason sum ≥ 8 . ) 4 . Prior treatment No prior treatment prostate cancer include prior surgery ( exclude TURP ) , pelvic lymph node dissection , radiation therapy , chemotherapy . Patients may receive 4 month androgen deprivation therapy ( LHRH agonist , antiandrogens , ) prior enrol study . 5 . Appropriate surgical candidate Patients must appropriate candidate radical prostatectomy estimate life expectancy &gt; 10 year determine urologist . Evidence underlying cardiac disease evaluate prior enrollment ensure patient high risk cardiac complication . 6 . Clotting history Patients history deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , and/or cerebrovascular accident currently require systemic anticoagulation eligible provide determined candidate radical prostatectomy . 7 .
