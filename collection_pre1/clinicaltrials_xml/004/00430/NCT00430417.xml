	<brief_summary>The primary aim study measure bone formation lactate non-lactating post-partum woman compare healthy non-pregnant control . The secondary aim obtain measurement Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein ( PTHrP ) , marker bone resorption , calcium vitamin D metabolism subject . The investigator believe lactate woman increase bone resorption increase bone formation compare non-lactating post-partum woman normal control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Metabolism Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein ( PTHrP ) Lactation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnancy lactation state alter maternal calcium bone metabolism may significant impact development peak bone mass . While two state characterize different hormonal environment , associate significant bone loss . The maternal hormonal mechanism provide calcium meet need develop fetus appear differ meet need lactation . During pregnancy , 30 gm calcium require fetus come predominantly increase maternal intestinal calcium absorption mediate 1 , 25 dihydroxy vitamin D factor . Several study measure total free 1 , 25 dihydroxy vitamin D pregnancy find value nearly double . Serum Parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) level fall 10-30 % mean non-pregnant value first trim increase mid-normal range term , ionized calcium remain normal throughout pregnancy . PTHrP level gradually increase throughout pregnancy although source ( maternal , fetal , placental ) remain unclear . Most study bone metabolism human pregnancy measure change marker bone turnover rather bone density avoid radiation exposure fetus . These study confound several variable effect hemodilution pregnancy , alter glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , degradation , clearance marker placenta , may cloud result . Some study report increase urinary marker bone resorption early mid pregnancy bone formation marker decrease rise term . Importantly , one assess state-of-the-art marker bone formation P1NP pregnancy lactation . During lactation human , estimate 600 1000 ml milk produce day daily calcium loss 200 400 mg . In contrast pregnancy , majority calcium come demineralization maternal skeleton , probably predominately mediate PTHrP set low estrogen . PTHrP level significantly high lactate woman non-lactating control intact PTH reduce approximately 50 % first several month lactation . The source PTHrP likely mammary gland , PTHrP level elevate 10,000 fold milk circulate maternal PTHrP level increase suckle . This also support mouse model tissue-specific ablation PTHrP gene lactate mammary gland result decrease bone loss lactation . When PTHrP enter maternal circulation , stimulate maternal bone resorption skeleton renal tubular resorption calcium . PTHrP indirectly suppress PTH ionized calcium rise upper level normal . 1 , 25 dihydroxy vitamin D level fall within normal range lactation , although report high lactate non-lactating postpartum woman . Intestinal absorption calcium also return normal post-partum period . Serial bone density measurement obtain lactation show fall 3-10 % trabecular bone ( spine , hip , femur ) small 1-2 % loss cortical bone . Both loss far great see early postmenopausal woman , woman receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist therapy . This imply fall estrogen mediates bone loss lactation . The bone loss lactation seem transient rapid recovery bone density postpartum woman wean resumption menses . Markers bone resorption measure urine several prospective study lactation human report elevated 2-3 fold . However , result may confound decrease GFR volume contraction may occur lactation compare pregnancy . Surprisingly , reliable marker bone resorption measure serum ( CTX NTX ) measure control lactation study . Markers bone formation measure osteocalcin ( Oc ) bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) generally report high lactation . However , result difficult interpret BSAP sensitive marker bone formation . Recent data emerge suggest Oc may measure bone resorption well formation . The current accurate measure bone formation serum amino-terminal telopeptides procollagen 1 ( P1NP ) , measure control study lactate woman . This prospective pilot cohort study post-partum lactating woman , post-partum non-lactating woman , match healthy control currently recently pregnant . The investigator hope estimate measurable difference bone formation resorption compare blood urine sample lactate woman non-lactating postpartum woman normal control . 100 female volunteer age 21 45 year recruit achieve 75 evaluable subject 25 three group . There two study visit , one 6-8 week another 12-14 week postpartum . Normal control see follicular phase menstrual cycle age race match post-partum woman .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy Caucasian , Hispanic , Asian woman age 2145 . Group 1 : Postpartum ( singleton pregnancy ) woman exclusively breastfeed , define 1 few bottle supplemental formula/day . Group 2 : Postpartum ( singleton pregnancy ) woman nonlactating , define bottlefeeding wean baby breastfeed least 4 week prior study . Group 3 : Controls Healthy , nonpregnant woman race agematched breastfeed woman group one . They may lactate pregnant within last year . Subjects cardiac , hypertensive , vascular , renal ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 ) , pulmonary , endocrine , musculoskeletal , hepatic , hematologic , malignant rheumatologic disease exclude study . Smokers history significant alcohol drug abuse exclude . Baseline hypertension ( systolic BP &gt; 160 mm/Hg ) hypotension ( systolic BP &lt; 90 mm/Hg ) . Subjects take chronic medication except stable dos thyroid hormone , prenatal , vitamin supplement , oral contraceptive . Those received investigational drug past 90 day exclude study . Women currently pregnant exclude study . Women become pregnant vitro fertilization IVF hormonal manipulation ( i.e . fertility drug clomid ) also exclude , may alter prepregnant hormonal state . All woman urine pregnancy test perform two study visit must pregnant order continue study . Subjects allow donate blood study visit . In order narrow statistical variation study population , AfricanAmericans exclude demonstrated difference renal excretion calcium vitamin D absorption .</criteria>
