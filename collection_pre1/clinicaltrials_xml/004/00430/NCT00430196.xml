	<brief_summary>In study , compare BOTOX® versus Zanaflex ® treatment muscle overactivity upper limb follow stroke brain traums . This critical step development local intramuscular treatment patient muscle overactivity follow acute brain lesion , oppose classic oral treatment . This study multicenter , randomize , prospective , parallel , double blind study enroll subject twelve site ( include Mt . Sinai ) throughout United States Europe . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy BOTOX® compare Zanaflex® reduce upper limb muscle tone post-stroke subject , well evaluate change muscle tone-related disability drug-therapy tolerance . This 18 week study . Subjects eligible medically stable upper limb spasticity 6 month first stroke . Subjects randomize one three treatment group : Treatment Group I - intramuscular BOTOX® plus oral placebo , Treatment Group II - intramuscular placebo plus oral Zanaflex® , Treatment Group III - intramuscular placebo plus oral placebo . The dose BOTOX® discretion investigator maximum 500 U per subject . The dose Zanaflex® 4mg/day maximum 36mg/day . The study anticipate 150 subject enrol provide sufficient information answer primary objective safety efficacy study .</brief_summary>
