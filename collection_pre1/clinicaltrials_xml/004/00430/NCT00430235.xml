	<brief_summary>Purpose : To determine efficacy BAY 43-9006 combination bicalutamide patient chemo-naïve hormone-refractory prostate cancer . Hypothesis : That PSA response BAY 43-9006 combination bicalutamide give patient chemo-naïve hormone-refractory prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study BAY 43-9006 Combination With Bicalutamide Patients With Chemo-Naïve Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification : The biologic clinical activity tolerability BAY 43-9006 , therapeutic need propose patient population , experimental evidence support target VEGF/VEGFR MAPK pathways combination androgen receptor blockade prostate cancer , provide strong rationale propose phase II trial evaluate tolerability anti-cancer activity combine treatment non-steroidal anti-androgen bicalutamide multi-targeted kinase inhibitor BAY 43-9006 patient prostate cancer progress castration therapy . Objectives : The primary study objective define efficacy ( i.e . post treatment decrement PSA ( PSA response ) ) BAY 43-9006 combination bicalutamide patient chemo-naïve hormone-refractory prostate cancer . Secondary Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability BAY 43-9006 give combination bicalutamide patient HRPC . - To determine time treatment failure , PSA progression disease progression HRPC patient treat BAY 43-9006 combination bicalutamide . - To determine objective response rate HRPC patient measurable disease treat BAY 43-9006 combination bicalutamide . Research Method : This phase II clinical trial patient androgen independent prostate cancer evaluate therapeutic activity safety profile BAY 43-9006 give orally recommended phase II dose 400 mg PO BID continuously combination bicalutamide 50 mg PO daily continuously . Each 4 week period consider 1 cycle . Doses adjust toxicity . Statistical Analysis : Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint study rate PSA-response combination patient rise PSA post castration therapy . Secondary Endpoints : Secondary endpoint include time treatment failure , time PSA progression , duration PSA response , median survival time , 1 year survival rate , objective tumor response rate stable disease rate define RECIST criterion , response duration , incidence toxicity NCI CTCAE .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologic cytologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . 2 . Patients must lowbulk asymptomatic metastatic biochemical recurrent disease curative therapy exists . 3 . Patients must document evidence PSA progression receive androgen ablative therapy , i.e . must hormone refractory . 4 . The PSA must &gt; 5 μg/L time study entry . 5 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 6 . Age 18 year age old 7 . Patients must life expectancy least 12 week . 8 . Chemotherapy : No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy permissible . Neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy permissible provide &gt; 12 month prior registration . 9 . Hormonal Therapy : Prior hormone therapy form medical surgical castration require . Patients must hormone refractory previously currently treat androgen ablative therapy . Patients may receive one line nonsteroidal anti androgens combination chemical surgical castration . Use prior Bicalutamide restrict less 3 month continuous usage . Patients must antiandrogens least 6 week prior study entry . 10 . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . 11 . Steroids . Current treatment steroid ≤ equivalent prednisone 20 mg day permit . 12 . Men childbearing potential must use effective form contraception i.e . double barrier method . 13 . Laboratory Requirements within 7 day prior enrollment Hematology : Hemoglobin ≥ 100g/L Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L INR ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal Biochemistry : AST , ALT within normal limit Bilirubin within normal limit Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit normal 15 . Patient consent must obtain 16 . Patients must accessible treatment followup . 17 . Protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient registration . 1 . Prior use BAY 439006 VEGF/VEGFR EGFR target agent . 2 . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition BAY 439006 agent use study . 5 . Other serious intercurrent illness medical condition might aggravate protocol treatment include : myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry : myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry congestive heart failure unstable angina cardiomyopathy unstable ventricular arrhythmia uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 , diastolic blood pressure ≥100 ) control psychotic disorder serious infection peptic ulcer disease history bleed diathesis 6 . Upper gastrointestinal condition would preclude compliance oral medication . 7 . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction BAY 439006 . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 8 . Patients require large amount narcotic therapy control pain ( e.g . morphine equivalent dose &gt; 30 mg/day ) since patient would appropriately offer systemic chemotherapy . 9 . Patients require therapeutic anticoagulation .</criteria>
