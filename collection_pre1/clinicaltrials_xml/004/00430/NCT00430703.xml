	<brief_summary>The aim study determine whether passive gait training increase arousal , demonstrate change EEG ( electroencephalogram ) activity . Hypotheses : 1 ) Passive gait training increase EEG-frequency patient impaired consciousness due severe traumatic brain injury . 2 ) Passive gait training increase conductivity speed cognitive P300-component ERP patient impaired consciousness due severe traumatic brain injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe traumatic brain injury , especially high energy trauma , characterise focal lesion diffuse axonal injury , lead dysfunction cortico-spinal , cortico- cortical connection reticular activation system . Formatio reticularis play important role arousal . Tactile proprioceptive stimulation view improve level consciousness coma patient popular western world despite insufficient evidence effectiveness . Affolter-Bobath-Coombes-concept commonly used tool rehabilitation brain damage patient . This concept base theory tactile , proprioceptive oral stimulation develop new connection brain thereby stimulate consciousness behaviour . Elliot et al show improvement level consciousness due postural change lie position stand posture 8 12 patient use Wessex Head Injury Matrix . Passive movement result proprioceptive stimulation ; effect close achieve physiological voluntary activity . PET fMRI study show passive movement activate several area motor cortex . In order increase afferent cortical input , passive gait training body weight support robotic gait orthosis could use patient impaired consciousness , inability cooperate poor balance . This device give possibility establish therapeutically correct upright body position passive legs movement simultaneously . To knowledge study , illustrate effect passive gait train cortical activity patient impaired consciousness due severe traumatic brain injury . Our hypothesis passive gait train group patient increase arousal , show increased EEG ( electroencephalogram ) -frequency increase conductivity speed cognitive P300-component ERP ( Event Related Potentials ) . Comparison ( ) : EEG- ERP-activity single training session robotic gait orthosis patient severe traumatic brain injury , compare EEG- ERP-activity single training session robotic gait orthosis healthy person .</detailed_description>
