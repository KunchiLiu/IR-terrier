	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes atherosclerotic , pro-inflammatory pro-oxidative stress.Both vascular oxidative stress inflammation CVD risk factor impact endothelial function . Carvedilol demonstrate preclinical clinical study ( although limit size ) exert anti-inflammatory antioxidant property : ( 1 ) reduce inflammation marker high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) ; ( 2 ) reduce oxidative stress via dually eliminate exist reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) suppress generation ROS ; ( 3 ) prevent lipid peroxidation myocardial cell membrane ; ( 4 ) protect endothelial vascular muscle cell oxygen radical-mediated injury . This project study effect carvedilol CR blood vessel diabetic hypertensive patient compare Lisinopril alone . This study involve wean patient current antihypertensive medication start Lisinopril Carvedilol CR placebo 6 month study effect drug period thereafter .</detailed_description>
