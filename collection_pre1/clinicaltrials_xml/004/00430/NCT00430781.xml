	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion meet : Signed , write informed consent prior perform studyrelated procedure Female subject ≥18 year age FIGO Stage IVB , recurrent persistent cervical cancer Life expectancy least 12 week ECOG status 0 1 . Histologically confirm FIGO Stage IVB , recurrent persistent squamous cell carcinoma , adenosquamous carcinoma , adenocarcinoma cervix amenable curative treatment surgery and/or radiation therapy Measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must ≥ 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpitation , plain xray , CT MRI , ≥10 mm measure spiral CT. At least one `` target lesion '' use assess response define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ; Terasse , 2000 ) . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . Received 0 1 prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . Note : Chemotherapy give combination radiation therapy radiosensitizer count toward prior therapy limit Recovered effect surgery chemotherapy . At least three week must elapse last administration chemotherapy . Adequate organ bone marrow function define Table 1 . Table 1 : ( Definitions Adequate Organ Function ) System : ( Laboratory Values ) Hematologic : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ( ≥ 1.5 X 109/L ) Hemoglobin1 ( ≥9 g/dL ) Platelets ( ≥100 X 109/L ) Hepatic : Total bilirubin ( ≤1.5 X ULN ) AST ALT ( ≤2.5 X ULN ) Renal : Calculated creatinine clearance2 ( ≥50 mL/min ) Urine protein3 ( Negative , trace +1 dipstick urinalysis &lt; 1.0 gram determine 24 hour urine protein analysis . ) Subjects may transfusion within 7 day screen assessment . Calculated Cockcroft Gault formula See Appendix 7 : Renal Function Tests A patient first screen dipstick urinalysis . If urine protein dipstick analysis ≥2+ , 24hour urine protein must assess 24 hour urine protein must &lt; 1 g protein eligible . Ability swallow retain oral medication . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : A hysterectomy A bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) A bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal ( total cessation menses ≥ 1 year ) Childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior first dose study treatment , preferably close first dose possible , agree use adequate contraception . GSK acceptable contraceptive method , use consistently accordance product label instruction physician , follow : An intrauterine device document failure rate le 1 % per year . Vasectomized partner sterile prior female subject 's entry sole sexual partner female . Complete abstinence sexual intercourse 14 day exposure investigation product , dose period , least 21 day last dose investigational product . Doublebarrier contraception ( condom spermicidal jelly , foam suppository , film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm spermicide ) . Note : Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drugdrug interaction . Subjects must provide write informed consent prior performance study specific procedure assessment , must willing comply treatment followup outline protocol . Procedures conduct apart routine clinical management patient ( e.g. , blood count , image study ) obtain prior sign inform consent may utilize screening purpose provide test obtain specify protocol A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma cervix . Prior use biologic therapy VEGF , VEGFR , ErbB1/ErbB2 inhibitor . Concurrent cancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , tumor embolization ) . Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial . Use investigational anticancer drug within 28 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose study medication . Has take take prohibited medication list protocol . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric , condition could interfere patient 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study . History another malignancy . Note : Patients another malignancy diseasefree 5 year , patient history completely resect nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . History clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . Routine screen CNS image study ( compute tomography [ CT ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) require clinically indicate . Malabsorption Syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation ; history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 4 week prior begin therapy . Presence uncontrolled infection . Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate pazopanib . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation define QTc interval &gt; 470 msec . History one follow cardiac condition within past 6 month : Cardiac angioplasty stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina History cerebrovascular accident pulmonary embolus within past 6 month . Has Class III IV heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system ( See Appendix 6 ) Poorly control hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 140mmHg , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90mmHg ) . Note : Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . The blood pressure ( BP ) must reassess two occasion separate minimum 24 hour . The mean SBP/DBP value BP assessment must &lt; 140/90mmHg order subject eligible study . History untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month ( e.g . calf vein thrombosis ) . Note : Patients recent DVT treat therapeutic anticoagulant agent ( exclude therapeutic warfarin ) least 6 week eligible . Presence nonhealing , nontumor relate wound , fracture , ulcer , presence symptomatic peripheral vascular disease . Subjects bilateral hydronephrosis alleviate ureteral stent percutaneous drainage . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 4 week prior begin therapy , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study ; minor surgical procedure fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 1 week prior begin therapy also exclude .
