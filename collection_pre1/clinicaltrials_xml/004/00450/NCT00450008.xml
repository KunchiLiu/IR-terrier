	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study GM-CSF , Thalidomide Plus Docetaxel Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As men diagnose treated prostate cancer early age , number experience rise level prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) initial treatment increase , affect approximately 50,000 patient year . These three drug commercially available . Thalidomide angiogenesis inhibitor block development new blood vessel . GM-CSF stimulate body 's immune response fight cancer . Docetaxel active chemotherapeutic agent treatment prostate cancer . GM-CSF thalidomide proven activity suppress PSA value . This study design offer opportunity add cytotoxic therapy ( docetaxel ) combination active pathobiologic regimen ( GM-CSF plus thalidomide ) eradicate micrometastatic disease , thus potentially offer significant delay clinical failure measure rise PSA radiographic involvement . Additionally , delay use hormone therapy potential significant benefit . GM-CSF administer fix dose 3 day per week subcutaneous injection 12 month . Participants receive fix dose thalidomide orally bedtime daily without interruption 12 month . Docetaxel administer intravenously 1 hour week 1 every cycle ( every 3 week ) 18 week .</detailed_description>
