	<brief_title>Lycopene Treating Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare differences tissue concentration lycopene patient prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy treat different dos neoadjuvant lycopene supplementation . II . Compare change serum lycopene concentration baseline 4-7 week patient treat different dos lycopene . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect treatment down-regulating 5-alpha-reductase activity measure change ratio testosterone ( T ) dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) serum baseline 4-7 week ratio T : DHT prostatic surgical tissue post-treatment . II . Determine effect treatment attenuate baseline blood serum concentration total prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , free PSA , human kallikrein 2 patient . III . Determine effect treatment growth potential examine post-treatment radical prostatectomy tissue specimens proliferative index ( PI ) Ki-67 expression , apoptotic index ( AI ) TUNEL assay , PI : AI ratio patient . IV . Determine effect treatment modulate putative biomarkers lycopene efficacy , include serum concentration insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 IGF bind protein-3 , lymphocyte oxidative DNA damage capacity Comet assay , GST-pi expression prostatic tissue patient . V. Compare histological effect different dos lycopene putative prognostic feature , include presence extent high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia , prostatitis , total tumor volume , local invasion ( vascular lymphatic , capsular , seminal vesicle ) , pathologic stage , Gleason score , surgical margin , lymph node status patient . VI . Determine effect treatment modulate RNA expression androgen-related gene microarray analysis patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive placebo orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 4-7 week , undergo radical prostatectomy . ARM II : Patients receive low-dose lycopene PO QD 4-7 week , undergo radical prostatectomy . ARM III : Patients receive high-dose lycopene PO QD 4-7 week , undergo radical prostatectomy . Tumor sample collect prostatectomy laboratory study , include GST-pi expression immunohistochemistry ; histological analysis ; microarray analysis androgen-related gene ; ratio testosterone ( T ) dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) ; Ki-67 expression ; lycopene tumor-concentration measurement . Patients undergo blood collection baseline , week 4 , week 7 laboratory study , include serum lycopene concentration measurement ; level T DHT high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC/MS/MS ) analysis ; serum concentration total prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , free PSA , human kallikrein 2 ; lymphocyte oxidative DNA damage capacity ; serum concentration insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 IGF bind protein-3 radioimmunological assay .</detailed_description>
