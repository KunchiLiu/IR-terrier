	<brief_title>VEGF Trap Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage III Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor response rate ( complete partial response ) patient recurrent inoperable stage III IV melanoma treat VEGF Trap . II . Compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen vs historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . II . Determine toxicity tolerability regimen patient . III . Determine impact regimen laboratory correlate include anti-VEGF Trap antibody test pharmacokinetics patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive VEGF Trap IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline , prior course 2 , 60 day completion study treatment pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . Samples analyze enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
