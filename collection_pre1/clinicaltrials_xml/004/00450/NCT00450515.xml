	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , vinflunine capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give vinflunine together capecitabine work treat patient previously treat metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinflunine Capecitabine Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate tumor response rate patient previously treat metastatic breast cancer treat vinflunine capecitabine . Secondary - Describe adverse event profile regimen patient . - Determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine time treatment failure patient treat regimen . - Describe quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive vinflunine IV 20 minute day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , every course , completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
