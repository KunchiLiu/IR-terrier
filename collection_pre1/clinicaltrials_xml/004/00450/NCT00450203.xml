	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , epirubicin , cisplatin , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor , lapatinib , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Lapatinib target specific growth receptor , HER-2 . Chemotherapy together bevacizumab lapatinib , HER-2 positive tumour , may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II/III trial study side effect well give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient previously untreated stomach cancer , gastroesophageal junction cancer low oesophageal cancer remove surgery . The feasibility study study safety add lapatinib chemotherapy patient HER-2 positive previously untreated stomach cancer , gastroesophageal junction cancer low oesophageal cancer remove surgery . The feasibility study also assess feasibility timely HER-2 test estimate HER-2 positivity rate patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess safety efficacy neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy comprise epirubicin hydrochloride , cisplatin , capecitabine without bevacizumab patient previously untreated , resectable gastric , gastroesophageal junction lower oesophageal cancer . - Assess safety neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy comprise epirubicin hydrochloride , cisplatin , capecitabine without lapatinib patient HER-2 positive previously untreated , resectable gastric , gastroesophageal junction lower oesophageal cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize , open-label , control study . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I II : Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV cisplatin IV 4 hour day 1 capecitabine orally twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery 5-6 week completion chemotherapy . Patients receive 3 additional course chemotherapy begin 6-10 week surgery . - Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute , epirubicin hydrochloride IV , cisplatin IV 4 hour day 1 capecitabine orally twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery 5-8 week completion chemotherapy . Patients receive 3 additional course chemotherapy bevacizumab begin 6-10 week surgery . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Maintenance therapy repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm IV : Patients receive lapatinib orally daily , epirubicin hydrochloride IV , cisplatin IV 4 hour day 1 capecitabine orally twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery 5-8 week completion chemotherapy . Patients receive 3 additional course chemotherapy lapatinib begin 6-10 week surgery . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise lapatinib orally daily day 1-21 . Maintenance therapy repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , treatment , follow-up period . After completion study treatment , patient follow 9 , 18 , 27 week start course 4 , 1 year post surgery , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1063 patient recruit bevacizumab comparison study ( closed recruitment ) 40 patient HER-2 positive tumour recruit ST03 feasibility study .</detailed_description>
