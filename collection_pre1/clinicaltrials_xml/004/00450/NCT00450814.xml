	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vaccine therapy give without cyclophosphamide see well work treat patient multiple myeloma come back ( recurrent ) respond previous treatment ( refractory ) . Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving vaccine therapy together cyclophosphamide may better treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oncolytic measles virus encode thyroidal sodium iodide symporter ( MV-NIS ) administer without cyclophosphamide patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate confirm response rate MV-NIS alone patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma exhaust therapeutic option . ( Phase II , Cohort A ) III . To evaluate confirm response rate MV-NIS alone patient relapse good partial response ( VGPR ) complete response ( CR ) receive myeloma direct therapy least 12 week . ( Phase II , Cohort B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety toxicity intravenous administration Edmonston vaccine strain measles virus engineer express thyroidal sodium iodide symporter ( MV-NIS ) administer without cyclophosphamide patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate confirm response rate MV-NIS patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate adverse event profile MV-NIS patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate overall survival , failure-free survival progression-free survival . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time course viral gene expression virus elimination , biodistribution virally infected cell various time point infection MV-NIS ( administer without cyclophosphamide ) use 99m-technetium ( Tc ) gamma camera imaging . ( Phase I II ) II . To assess virus replication , viremia , viral shed urine respiratory secretion , virus persistence systemic administration MV-NIS ( administer without cyclophosphamide ) . ( Phase I II ) III . To monitor humoral response inject virus . ( Phase I II ) IV . To explore anti-myeloma efficacy ( i.e . clinical response rate , time progression , progression free survival , duration response ) virus use standard myeloma response criterion well immunoglobulin free light chain measurement . ( Phase I II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study MV-NIS follow phase II study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm ( Stage 1 Stage 2 ) phase I assign Stage 1 phase II . STAGE 1 ( MV-NIS ALONE , close accrual 12/17/2009 reopen 10/13/2011 ) : Patients receive MV-NIS intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . STAGE 2 ( MV-NIS AND CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE , temporarily close accrual 10/13/11 ) : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute MV-NIS IV 1 hour 2 day later . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , 12 week , every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
