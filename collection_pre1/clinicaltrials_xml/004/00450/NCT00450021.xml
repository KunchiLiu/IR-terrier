	<brief_summary>This study test new radioactive tracer , [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP , use positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . The tracer use visualize cannabinoid receptor , protein brain mediate variety natural chemical . These receptor may important behavioral disease addiction , obesity psychiatric disease . Healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age may eligible study . Ten participant undergo whole body PET image determine [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP tracer distribute body order calculate radiation exposure tracer . Another 10 subject undergo brain imaging [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP measure cannabinoid receptor brain . All participant evaluate medical history physical examination , blood urine test electrocardiogram ( ECG ) scan . They PET scan . For procedure , catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein arm tracer inject . A special mask fit head attach bed help keep head place scan . Subjects undergo brain imaging also catheter place artery wrist blood sample collect procedure . The scan last 2 2.5 hour . Subjects undergo brain imaging also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) within 1 year PET scan . For MRI , subject lie bed move tubular scanner , wear earplug protect ear loud noise occur scan . The procedure take 1 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Cannabinoid Receptors Using New Radioactive Tracer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BRAIN IMAGING : OBJECTIVE : The central cannabinoid receptor , CB ( 1 ) one abundant neuromodulatory receptor brain . It find glutamatergic , dopaminergic GABA-ergic synaptic terminal belong G-protein couple receptor family . The CB ( 1 ) target drug therapy , include use antagonist appetite suppressant . The central cannabinoid receptor CB ( 1 ) never visualize human . In collaboration Eli Lilly , develop promise PET ligand CB ( 1 ) receptor : [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP . This study know Eli Lilly H6O-MC-GCEB . STUDY POPULATION : In current protocol , wish evaluate [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP approximately 15 healthy subject . DESIGN : Brain image study consist subject evaluation follow PET MRI scan . OUTCOME MEASURES : We intend determine kinetics brain uptake washout , clearance plasma , distribution volume [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP calculate compartmental modeling . Distribution volume proportional density receptor equal ratio equilibrium uptake brain concentration parent radiotracer plasma . WHOLE BODY DOSIMETRY : OBJECTIVE : Should brain image study prove successful , continue whole body dosimetry study . Preliminary dosimetry study [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP perform nonhuman primate ; however , need continue human investigation novel tracer continue . This study know Eli Lilly H6O-MC-GCEC . STUDY POPULATION : In current protocol , wish evaluate [ ( 11 ) C ] MePPEP approximately 10 additional healthy subject . DESIGN : The whole body dosimetry study consist subject evaluation follow PET scan . OUTCOME MEASURES : We intend determine whole body distribution activity thereby calculate radiation exposure organs body .</detailed_description>
