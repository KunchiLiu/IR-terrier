	<brief_summary>Background : - Flutamide approve drug prostate cancer block effect testosterone prostate cancer cell may slow progression disease . - The vaccine study consist prim vaccine call PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM , make vaccinia virus , boost vaccine call PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM , make fowlpox virus . DNA insert prim boost vaccine virus cause production protein enhance immune activity also produce prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) protein normally produce patient tumor cell . - GM-CSF , give along vaccine , chemical boost immune system . It use study try increase usefulness vaccine increase number immune cell vaccination site . Objectives : -To determine treatment prostate cancer vaccine plus flutamide effective flutamide alone delay disease progression patient prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old androgen-insensitive prostate cancer spread beyond prostate gland . - Patients rise PSA already treat anti-iandrogen therapy ( either bicalutamide nilutamide ) . Design : - There two treatment group study . Group A receive flutamide ; group B receive flutamide plus vaccine . - Patients group receive flutamide mouth three time day . - Patients group B receive PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM day 1 PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM day 29 every 4 week . All vaccine give injection skin . - Patients blood test PSA level every month scan every 3 month disease worsen . - After 3 month therapy , patient receive group A ( flutamide alone ) may cross receive vaccine develop rise PSA scan show sign disease spread . Patients group B ( flutamide plus vaccine ) stop flutamide may continue vaccine therapy . At point patient may continue receive treatment disease progress PSA level rise ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - There standard care prostate cancer patient progress hormone therapy rise serum PSA level without evidence metastatic disease . - We complete phase II trial men stage disease randomize receive pox vector PSA vaccine vs. antiandrogen nilutamide . - The median time treatment failure nilutamide 7.6 month . - 12 patient vaccine arm nilutamide add time PSA progression . - The median time treatment failure addition nilutamide 13.9 month , total 25.9 month initiation vaccine therapy . - This suggest combination hormone therapy vaccine therapy may lead improved clinical benefit compare hormone therapy alone . - Due increase toxicity nilutamide compare antiandrogens patient prior exposure bicalutamide therapy , plan use flutamide second line hormonal manipulation study . Objectives ( Primary ) : -To determine use combination vaccine plus flutamide may associate trend toward improvement time treatment failure compare flutamide alone . Eligibility : - Must non metastatic androgen insensitive prostate cancer rise PSA castrate level testosterone evidence metastatic disease CT scan bone scan . - Hgb great equal 9 g/dL . - Lymphocyte count great equal 500/mm ( 3 ) . - Hepatic function : Bilirubin le equal 1.5 mg/dL , OR patient Gilbert 's syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 mg/dL , AST ALT less 2.5 time upper limit normal Design : -Flutamide administer dose 250 mg PO tid every day arm A B. rV-PSATRICOM administer s.c. day 1 Arm B. rF-PSATRICOM administer s.c. day 29 &amp; every 4 week Arm B . - Sargramostim 100 microg s.c. give vaccine site 4 consecutive day start day 1 vaccine patient enrol NCI site . - For patient decline PSA restaging do unless develop symptom consistent metastatic disease . - For patient rise PSA , 2 consecutive PSA rise see , CT do next schedule visit . They re-staged ( CT bone scan ) 3 month interval long PSA continue rise . - After 3 month therapy , patient receive flutamide alone ( arm A ) may cross receive vaccine develop rise PSA scan without metastatic disease . The vaccine may commence 4 week flutamide stop PSA continue rise . If antiandrogen withdrawal response ( decline PSA 28 day discontinuation flutamide ) , PSA serum level check every 28 day vaccine may commence serum PSA level begin rise ( scan negative metastatsis ) . Patients arm B flutamide discontinue may continue vaccine therapy . At point patient may continue receive treatment study development disease scan second occurrence clinical progression . - Patients study 2 year stable disease get vaccine , clinic visit may schedule every 8 week . ( Patients receive monthly vaccine continue monthly visit . ) -For patient stable disease attend clinic every 8 week , 2 consecutive PSA rise see , CT bone scan do next visit 4 week . They restaged ( CT bone scan ) 3 month interval long PSA continue rise .</detailed_description>
