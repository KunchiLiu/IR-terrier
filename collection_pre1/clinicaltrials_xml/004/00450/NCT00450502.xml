	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients must histologically confirm ( NIH pathology department ) solid tumor malignancy lymphoma metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist , associate minimal patient survival benefit . 2 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . 3 . Patients must complete chemotherapy biologic therapy great equal 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , UCN01 ) . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND/Phase Zero study . Patients must great equal 1 month since prior radiation major surgery . Patients must recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event . However , patient receive bisphosphonates cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer eligible therapy . 4 . Age great equal 18 year . 5 . The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) . 6 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 7 . Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL . Platelets great equal 100,000/microL . Total bilirubin within less equal 1.5 normal institutional limit . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal . creatinine le 1.5 x upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal . We allow patient Gilbert syndrome total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL . 8 . The effect batracylin develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 2 month discontinuation study . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test order eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother batracylin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated batracylin . 9 . Patients must slow acetylator NAT2 genotype define NAT2 5 , NAT2 6 , NAT2 7 , NAT2 14 . Theoretically slow acetylators low AcBAT concentration . A number different polymorphism NAT2 give rise amino acid substitution , demonstrate result absence catalytic activity vitro ( http : //www.louisville.edu/medschool/pharmacology/NAT.html ) . Screening four variant allele ( NAT2 5 , NAT2 6 , NAT2 7 NAT2 14 ) result detection vast majority Caucasian slow acetylators , though additional allele also common ethnic group . The precise percentage slow acetylators also vary ethnic origin , range 90 % North Africans le 10 % many Asian population , frequency 50 % Caucasians . The incidence fast acetylators ( potentially increase toxicity ) follow : 50 % among Caucasians , 50 % among Africans , 90 % among Japanese , 20 % among Egyptians . We plan select slow acetylators NAT2 subject determine batracylin MTD population . The screening occur prior study start patient sign inform consent form . Cogenics perform NAT2 analysis . 10 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients receive investigational agent . 2 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 6 month treatment brain metastasis , without steroid antiseizure medication . These patient may enrol discretion principal investigator . 3 . Patients clinically significant illness could compromise participation study , include , limited , active uncontrolled infection , immune deficiency confirm diagnosis HIV infection , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Inclusion Women Minorities Both men woman , member race ethnic group , eligible trial .</criteria>
