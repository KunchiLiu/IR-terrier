	<brief_title>Improving Vitamin D Status In Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis study : Our hypothesis method cholecalciferol replacement and/or low dose ultraviolet radiation skin may effective raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level conventional ergocalciferol therapy . Experimental strategy : We conduct prospective randomize trail determine recommend vitamin D therapy ( tan device , cholecalciferol ergocalciferol ) effective maintain improve vitamin D status winter month . We recruit CF patient accord follow inclusion exclusion criterion : Inclusion : Subjects see initially Emory CF center month September December , age &gt; 16 , male female , confirm cystic fibrosis genetic test sweat testing , FEV1 &gt; 40 % . Exclusion : History lung transplant await lung transplantation , current hospitalization great 6 hospitalizations/year , history malignancy , renal disease ( calculate GFR &lt; 50 % reduce normal ) , liver disease ( AST AST &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ) , great 10 mg prednisone equivalent , hypercalcemia , history easily burn skin sunlight exposure , take medication may cause photosensitivity , history skin cancer multiple mole family history skin cancer , moderate severe vitamin D deficiency ( 25 ( OH ) D ≤ 15 ng/ml ) . Physicians Emory CF center inform study . The primary CF doctor subject refer individual one study investigator potential recruitment . The principal investigator co-investigator meet prospective subject discus detail study . If subject agrees participate , sign inform consent form . The subject provide blood specimen screen visit determine eligibility study include 25-hydroxyvitamin D. If subject 's 25 ( OH ) D level ≤15 ng/ml ( moderate vitamin D deficiency ) , subject exclude study . We decide exclude moderately severely deficient patient ethical reason since subject may require aggressive medical management correction vitamin D status . The subject randomize either ergocalciferol 50,000 IU week 12 week , cholecalciferol 50,000 IU week 12 week , use portable tanning device 5 time week 12 week . The blood sample obtain screen use determine baseline 25 ( OH ) D , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . This assignment blind obvious reason . Subjects assign cholecalciferol ergocalciferol instruct take pill three time week . The subject assign portable tanning machine give instruction operate device . All subject complete baseline three day food diary determine daily calcium vitamin D intake level . Those subject already take calcium supplement instruct take 1500 mg calcium day . Those subject already take multivitamin supplement limit 800 IU vitamin D daily . Subjects allow continue usual diet ; however , limit number milk serving 3 serving day . Subjects also instruct travel sunny climates visit tan salon study . No restriction make regard outdoor activity since minimal vitamin D make winter month . Subjects return CF center 12 week randomization repeat blood test 25 ( OH ) D PTH . Every two week , research coordinator call subject discus compliance assign therapy . In particular , subject assign pill remind take pill weekly . Those subject assign UV light ask question regard presence skin erythema , photosensitivity , evidence tan potential side effect .</detailed_description>
