	<brief_summary>Premature infant , especially less 1250 gm birth extremely difficult feed . For unknown physiologic reason oral feeding also call enteral feeding well tolerated immature baby . Because challenge infant require intravenous fluid solution call parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) . Intravenous nutrition inadequate supply sufficient calorie growth body brain . The composition intravenous nutrition also toxic liver . For reason important achieve adequate enteral nutrition premature infant soon possible birth . However best feed method baby define . Since premature baby unable suck swallow properly , feed administer tube insert infant 's stomach . The timing feeds inconsistent . Some infant feed every 3 hour , whereas others feed every 4 hour . The purpose study determine feed method well . We hypothesize feed every 4 hour allow time digestion improve feed tolerance premature infant . In addition also facilitate discontinuation TPN sooner , thus cause less side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feeding Tolerance Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In premature infant feed tolerance limit due immaturity gastrointestinal tract . Motor pattern gastrointestinal tract differ greatly preterm infant compare adult . These difference gastrointestinal motor function premature neonates translates less efficient gastric empty slow intestinal transit time . It usually manifest residual feed stomach prior next schedule feeding may associate abdominal distention , bile-staining aspirate , lack stooling . In instance gastric residual benign relate immature gastrointestinal motility , however may also early indication bowel obstruction , ileus necrotizing enterocolitis . Thus , feed intolerance often lead temporary cessation feed , prolongs time reach full feed , well time parenteral nutrition ( predispose infant nosocomial infection , hepatic dysfunction ) , prolonged hospitalization . Achievement adequate enteral nutrition , soon possible birth ultimate goal low birth weight infant ( &lt; 1250 gm ) ; however best method sufficient enteral nutrition provide remain controversial . A number feed strategy practice . In Neonatal ICU feed initiated bolus infant feed either every 3 hour every 4 hour . A review literature ( 2006 ) reveal study compare two method feed . We hypothesize low birth weight infant ( ≤1250 gm ) tolerate feeding well introduce every 4 hour instead every 3 hour , provide sufficient time gastric empty . We propose conduct prospective , randomize , clinical trial determine whether intermittent bolus gavage feeding every 4 hour lead well feed tolerance intermittent bolus gavage feeding every 3 hour low birth weight infant &lt; 1250grams birth weight . Primary Hypothesis : Very low birth weight infant feed intermittent bolus gavage every 4 hour achieve full enteral feeding ( 120 kcal/kg per day ) early postnatal age less feeding intolerance infant feed every 3 hour . Secondary Hypothesis : Intermittent bolus gavage feed every 4 hour improve feed tolerance , cause less need parenteral nutrition major complication - cholestasis . Study Design : - Prospective , randomized clinical study recruitment NY Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Medical Center . - Written inform consent obtain one parent prior enrollment patient . Primary study endpoint : - Days reach full feed 120 ml/kg per day - Incidence feed intolerance Secondary study endpoint : - Days parenteral nutrition ( parenteral nutrition discontinue infant tolerates enteral feed 100 ml/kg per day ) . - Incidence severity cholestatic jaundice . Primary objective : To determine whether infant feed intermittent gastric bolus gavage every 4 hour less feed intolerance reach full feed least 2 day earlier infant feed every 3 hour . Secondary objective : To determine feed every 4 hour facilitate discontinuation parenteral nutrition earlier postnatal age result less incidence cholestasis . Inclusion Criteria Weight ≤ 1250 gm Sufficient stability start early ( day 3-5 ) enteral feeding Appropriate weight gestational age Infants receive ventilatory support indwell umbilical arterial catheter include Absence major congenital malformation Infant withdrawn study follow reason : Parental request If feeding initiate prior day life 10 NEC require surgery Prolonged ( &gt; 3days ) intolerance feed regimen Treatment plan : Feeding Protocol - Infants meet criterion randomly assign use seal opaque envelope , either every 3 hour every 4 hour feed group . - Nasogastric feeding initiated third fifth postnatal day provide infant 's cardiorespiratory status stable . - Bolus feed 30 60 min give per usual clinical practice - Expressed breast milk nutrition choice . If available Premature Formula 24 kcal/30 ml use per usual clinical practice . - Feeding start advanced daily increment depend infant 's weight : - 500 gm 750 gm - 10 ml/kg per day - 751gm 1000gm - 15 ml/kg per day - 1001 gm 1250gm - 20 ml/kg per day - Gastric residual measure prefeed ( every 3 4 hour ) - All feeding-related clinical decision ( withhold feeding ) attend physician 's discretion . - Parenteral nutrition , include lipid emulsion , start day 1 2 continued infant tolerate enteral feed 100 ml/kg per day . - Successful achievement full enteral feeding define ability tolerate enteral feeding 110-120 ml/kg per day least 48 hour . - Daily weight , intake output , number stool , number guaiac positive stool , number hour feeding withhold , episode apnea bradycardia record .</detailed_description>
