	<brief_summary>Mucociliary clearance , mucus secretion clear breathe airway , primary defense mechanism lung . Inhaled particle , include microbe cause infection , normally entrap mucus airway surface clear coordinated action tiny hair-like structure call cilium . Individuals primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) defective mucociliary clearance , turn lead lung infection disease .

	<brief_title>Evaluating Progression Diagnostic Tools Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PCD rare genetic disorder impair mucus clearance commonly result chronic cough infection airway , sinus , middle ear . Long last airway infection ultimately lead structural damage airway , know bronchiectasis , , turn , loss lung function . While PCD share similarities disease cystic fibrosis , important distinguish PCD cystic fibrosis . In particular , age onset progression PCD 's clinical lung disease , include time specific microbial pathogen infection bronchiectasis , remain poorly define . The purpose study determine lung disease progress time child adolescent PCD . Specific attention direct toward determine whether certain factor play role lung disease progression . The study also evaluate diagnostic tool quality life among individual PCD . Filling gap knowledge may help improve clinical management PCD future . This longitudinal study last 5 year . There total 5 study visit , visit occur yearly . Each study visit last 3 4 hour . All study visit include medical history review ; physical exam ; height , weight , vital sign measurement ; sample respiratory fluid mucus ; lung function test ; questionnaire . The initial visit may also include use probe measure nasal nitric oxide level blood collection genetic testing . Study visit 1 , 3 , 5 also include blood collection pregnancy test high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) scan chest image lung . At end month , participant report use oral , inhaled , intravenous antibiotic .</detailed_description>
