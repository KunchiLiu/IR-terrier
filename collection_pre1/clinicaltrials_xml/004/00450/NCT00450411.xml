	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Implant Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With External-Beam Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine late treatment-related gastrointestinal ( GI ) genitourinary ( GU ) adverse event patient locally recurrent adenocarcinoma prostate previously treat external-beam radiotherapy currently receive transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 palladium Pd 103 brachytherapy . Secondary - Determine acute treatment-related GI GU adverse event patient treat regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine disease-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine disease-specific survival patient treat regimen . - Determine clinical pattern tumor recurrence ( time local tumor progression distant failure ) patient treat regimen . - Determine time biochemical failure patient treat regimen . - Determine post-brachytherapy dosimetric coverage patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This prospective , multicenter study . Patients undergo transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 palladium Pd 103 brachytherapy . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 96 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
