	<brief_summary>The objective study answer clinical question already investigate ; , effect aortic infra-renal clamp unclamping intraocular pressure Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA ) repair ? Depending result , study may raise alleviate concern vascular surgery abdominal aortic aneurysm could contribute early perioperative exacerbation pre-existing eye disease increase patient 's vulnerability develop type blindness know ischemic optic neuropathy . The purpose observational study evaluate whether intraocular pressure measurement handheld tonometer detect change intraocular pressure relate intraoperative event aortic cross clamp unclamping may provide information cause perioperative blindness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Perioperative blindness nonocular surgery gain significant clinical interest overwhelm complication increase incidence . Initial publish study suggest rare occurrence estimate postoperative visual loss 0.002 % 0.0008 % ( 1,2 ) . However , retrospective review spinal cardiac surgery demonstrate high rate perioperative blindness ; , 0.2 % 0.06 % respectively ( 3,4 ) . The difference publish report suggest true incidence likely underestimated fear regard litigation , ineffective mean report extra work involve . Fortunately , numerous case report series middle late 1990s publish ; prompt American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Committee Professional Liability establish ASA Postoperative Visual Loss Registry ( POVL ) 1999 medium collect confidential , comprehensive perioperative data patient develop postoperative blindness . The POVL registry , along case series , demonstrate common cause visual loss non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy ( 5,6,7 ) . Perioperative non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy ( ION ) consequence patient surgery specific factor result hypoperfusion infarction optic nerve head ( 8 ) . Anatomical factor variation number short posterior ciliary artery ( sPCA ) supply optic nerve head , location sPCA watershed zone , small optic cup disk ratio increase susceptibility optic nerve ischemia ( 8,9 ) . Surgery specific factor involve profound blood loss , anemia , hypotension , prone position duration surgery ( 5,6,7,10 ) . The interaction surgical variable patient specific anatomical factor decrease ocular perfusion pressure ( difference mean arterial pressure intraocular pressure ) result ION ( 11 ) . Based determinant ocular perfusion pressure ( OPP ) , low mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) and/or high intraocular pressure ( IOP ) decrease OPP lead ION . Therefore , necessary investigate change IOP incur different type surgery may increase vulnerability develop ION . Normal IOP 12 - 20 mm Hg . Studies publish assess intraocular change prone positioning , laparoscopic surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( 12,13,14 ) . However , literature evaluate intraocular pressure abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) repair . AAA repair high-risk surgery associate blood loss , hypotension report case series associate ION ( 6 ) . The surgery involve clamp unclamping aorta facilitate excision aneurysm graft repair . Aortic cross clamp unclamping intense physiologic insult affect venous return , systemic vascular resistance , cardiac output , acid base status . These physiologic change pronounce proximal cross-clamping long duration . Because infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm common type AAA repair , assess IOP patient undergo elective infrarenal abdominal aortic reconstruction . Infrarenal aortic cross clamp associate increase venous return , central venous pressure arterial blood pressure ( 15 ) . The hemodynamic change infrarenal unclamping entail decrease venous return , central venous pressure arterial blood pressure ( 15 ) . The determinant intraocular pressure involve extraocular muscle tone , aqueous flow , choroidal blood volume central venous pressure ( 16 ) . The volume redistribution proximal aortic cross-clamp cause rise venous pressure , increase resistance aqueous drainage increase choroidal blood volume thereby increase intraocular pressure . However , aortic unclamping , choroidal blood volume IOP decrease venous return central venous pressure decline . Therefore , hypothesis IOP increase aortic cross clamp decrease follow aortic unclamping .</detailed_description>
