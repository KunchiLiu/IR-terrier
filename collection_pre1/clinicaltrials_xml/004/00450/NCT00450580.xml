	<brief_summary>This Phase IIIB , 48 Week , multicentre , randomize , open-label , parallel group study compare safety efficacy fosamprenavir plus ritonavir 1400mg/100mg once-daily fosamprenavir plus ritonavir 700mg/100mg twice-daily , administered abacavir/lamivudine 600mg/300mg once-daily antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 infect adult . This study utilize group-sequential design two stage : 1 ) interim 24 week cohort analysis approximately 200 subject 2 ) study continuation criterion meet interim analysis , enrolment additional 528 subject , follow minimum 48 week . The objective study demonstrate 1 ) non-inferior antiviral activity fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400mg/100mg QD compare fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700mg/100mg BID 2 ) superior fast non-HDL lipid profile subject receive fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400mg/100mg QD .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject ≥18 year age . Subject antiretroviralnaïve ( define ≤14 day prior therapy antiretroviral agent ) . Subject plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1,000 copies/mL screening . Subject willing able understand provide write informed consent prior participation study . A female eligible enter participate study : 1 . Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal ) ; , 2 . Childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test ( serum bHCG ) screen agree one follow method contraception ( contraception method must use consistently correctly , i.e. , accordance approve product label instruction physician ) : Complete abstinence intercourse 2 week prior administration investigational product , throughout study , least 2 week discontinuation study medication Double barrier method ( male condom/spermicide , male condom/diaphragm , diaphragm/spermicide ) . Hormonal contraception permit study Any intrauterine device ( IUD ) publish data show expected failure rate &lt; 1 % per year . Sterilization ( female subject male partner female subject ) . All subject participate study counsel practice safer sex . Prior randomization , subject enter Stage 2 must screen negative HLAB*5701 allele . Test may perform local laboratory result must available source document verification accord local practice . Subject initial acute phase CDC Clinical Category C infection Baseline . Subjects may enrol provide receive treatment infection clinically improve Baseline visit . Subject enrol one investigational drug protocol , may impact HIV RNA suppression . Subject , opinion Investigator , unable complete study dose period protocol evaluation assessment . Subject either pregnant breastfeeding . Subject suffers serious medical condition ( pancreatitis , diabetes , congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy cardiac dysfunction ) opinion Investigator would compromise safety subject . Subject preexist mental , physical , substance abuse disorder , opinion Investigator , may interfere subject 's ability comply dose schedule protocol evaluation assessment . Subject history inflammatory bowel disease intestinal malignancy , intestinal ischemia , malabsorption , gastrointestinal dysfunction , , opinion Investigator , may interfere drug absorption render subject unable take oral medication . Subject acute laboratory abnormality screening , , opinion Investigator , would preclude subject 's participation study investigational compound . If subject find acute Grade 4 laboratory abnormality screening , test may repeat within 45day screen window . Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality would exclude subject study participation . Subject estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min via CockcroftGault method [ Cockcroft , 1976 ] . This test may repeat within 45day screen window . NOTE : Creatinine clearance estimate use follow formula : For serum creatinine concentration mg/dL : For serum creatinine concentration µmol/L : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) hepatic impairment determine ChildPugh Score ≥ 5 . Subject receiving , receive within 90 day prior screen , lipid lowering agent , include drug follow class : HMGCoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) , niacin , fibrates , bile acid sequestrants , and/or fish oil supplement . Subjects anticipated require initiation therapy agent within 12 week Baseline eligible participate . Subject receive treatment radiation therapy cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent within 28 day prior Screening , anticipate need agent within study period . Subject receive treatment HIV1 immunotherapeutic vaccine agent documented activity HIV1 vitro within 28 day prior Screening , anticipate need study . Subjects require treatment follow medication within 28 day commencement investigational product , anticipate need study : Amiodarone , astemizole , bepridil , cisapride , dihydroergotamine , ergonovine , ergotamine , flecainide , halofantrine , lidocaine , lovastatin , methylergonovine , midazolam , pimozide , propafenone , quinidine , simvastatin , terfenadine , triazolam . Carbamazepine , dexamethasone , phenobarbital , phenytoin , primidone , rifampin , St Johns Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) , troglitazone . Systemic interleukins interferon . Subject history allergy investigational product excipients therein . Subject evidence genotypic ( define current ANRS AC11 algorithm ) resistance screen prior document evidence genotypic and/or phenotypic ( threshold reduce susceptibility ) resistance amprenavir/ritonavir , abacavir lamivudine . Subjects recruit site France exclude : The subject affiliate beneficiary social security . The subject previously participate experimental drug and/or vaccine trial ( ) within 60 day 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect experimental drug vaccine whichever longer , prior screen study . The subject participate simultaneously another clinical study . Notwithstanding minimum inclusion exclusion criterion , investigator urge follow country specific guideline exist make decision subject eligible study participation .</criteria>
