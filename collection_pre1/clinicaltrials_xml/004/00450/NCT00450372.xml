	<brief_title>Pegylated Arginine Deiminase Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : - Determine clinical response ( complete partial response ) patient unresectable metastatic melanoma treat pegylated arginine deiminase . Secondary : - Determine toxicity profile drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . - Determine progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive pegylated arginine deiminase intramuscularly twice week week 1-4 . Courses repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample acquire baseline every 2 week thereafter pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 43 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
