	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood tissue smoker ( closed entry 7/15/07 ) non-smokers cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor learn risk factor lung cancer may help study cancer future . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study carcinogen lung tissue smoker ( closed entry 7/15/07 ) non-smokers newly diagnose stage I , stage II , stage III non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0424 - Carcinogens Lung Tissue From Smokers ( Closed Entry 7/15/07 ) Non-Smokers With Newly Diagnosed Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess lung tissue patient stage I , stage II , stage IIIA , stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer specific tobacco smoke carcinogen ( include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [ PAH ] DNA adduct , alteration specific gene , include p53 K-ras , expression HER2 estrogen receptor α β ) . - Determine whether tobacco smoke carcinogen differ gender smoking status , adjust potential exposure influential factor , include family smoking status , medication use , hormonal reproductive factor . - Measure level PAH-DNA adduct lymphocytes lung tissue examine correlation two tissue source . - Determine whether DNA damage level tissue well lymphocytes high female male level smoke . - Determine polymorphism several gene involve metabolism specific carcinogen investigated steroidogenesis metabolism . - Summarize patient self-report questionnaire data active passive smoking , carcinogenic exposure , smoke preference , economic educational status , family smoking status , reproductive factor , weight loss , medication use category male versus female never-smoker versus ever-smoker . OUTLINE : This case-series , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender smoking status ( never smoker [ &lt; 100 cigarette smoke lifetime ] v ever smoker [ ≥ 100 cigarette smoke lifetime ] [ close accrual 7/15/07 ] ) . Patients complete Lung Cancer Epidemiology Questionnaire detail assessment following : - Exposure active passive smoke - Occupational exposure - Reproductive hormonal risk factor - Weight loss - Economic educational status - Family smoke status - Medication use - Other variable relevant analysis ( e.g. , HER2 , estrogen receptor status ) Peripheral blood sample collect research study . Previously collect tissue sample also study laboratory . Samples examine DNA adduct level . Estrogen receptor α β assess immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . HER2 expression amplification measure chromogenic situ hybridization . IHC DNA-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -single-stranded conformational polymorphism assay use analyze p53 mutation . RAS mutation analyze restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR assay . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 4-aminobiphenyl-DNA damage assess IHC immunofluorescence . Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry use genotype polymorphism , include CYP1A1 , CYP1B1 , GSTM1 , GSTP1 , MPO , NAT-1 , NAT-2 , CYP19 , CYP17 , SULT1A1 . Patients follow annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 900 patient accrue study ( female male smoker stratum close accrual 7/15/07 ) .</detailed_description>
