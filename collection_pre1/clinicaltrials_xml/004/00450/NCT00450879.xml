	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well pazopanib hydrochloride work treat patient breast cancer newly diagnose come back near place original tumor remove surgery . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth prevent growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth . Giving pazopanib hydrochloride surgery may make tumor small reduce amount tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine biologic effect , measure decrease phosphorylation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) and/or decrease microvessel density , breast tumor biopsy treatment daily oral GW786034 ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) least 12 consecutive day early stage , operable breast cancer local and/or regional recurrence amenable surgery . II . To determine mechanism antitumor effect , measure reduction tumor cell proliferation ( Ki67 ) increase apoptosis breast tumor biopsy treatment GW786034 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine change level tissue vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) breast tumor biopsy treatment GW786034 . II . To evaluate change phosphorylation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , protein kinase B ( AKT ) breast tumor biopsy treatment GW786034 . III . To identify gene expression pattern breast tumor biopsy treatment GW786034 . IV . To evaluate change VEGF ( plasma ) VEGFR-2 ( serum ) circulate biomarkers treatment GW786034 . V. To evaluate change circulate tumor cell peripheral blood treatment GW786034 . VI . To determine whether steady-state plasma concentration GW786034 correlate inhibition phosphorylated ( phospho ) -VEGFR-2 endpoint breast tumor biopsy . VII . To evaluate change vascular permeability dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) -magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) breast treatment GW786034 . VIII . To compare image obtain bilateral DCE-MRI breast , , treatment GW786034 . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12-20 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgical resection tumor day 13 21 ( 24 hour completion pazopanib hydrochloride ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 30 day .</detailed_description>
