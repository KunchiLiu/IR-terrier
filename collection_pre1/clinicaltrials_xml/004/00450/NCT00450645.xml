	<brief_title>Residual Vein Thrombosis Optimal Duration Low Molecular Weight Heparin Cancer Patients With Deep Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND . Currently consensus optimal duration antithrombotic therapy cancer patient experience first episode deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) low limb . Recent guideline suggest patient active cancer suffer DVT low limb treat least six month low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) . However , although current scheme establish duration LMWH and/or Oral Anticoagulants ( OA ) base nature index DVT ( idiopathic provoke ) , new data start select parameter individualise decision . The use D-dimer proven effective select OA duration information valid non cancer patient idiopathic DVT . Moreover , D-dimer seem reliable patient chronic condition ( cancer ) . Recently , presence Residual Vein Thrombosis ( RVT ) find associate increased risk recurrency ( even contralateral leg venous site ) establish optimal duration anticoagulant . However , information present cancer patient , population consider high risk recurrent thrombosis . To test hypothesis , plan randomize study cancer patient first episode symptomatic idiopathic provoke DVT treat LMWH 6 month . Patients without RVT continue anticoagulation ( group B ) , whereas RVT randomize either stop ( group A2 ) continue heparin ( group A1 ) . METHODS Study patient . Cancer patient first episode document unprovoked provoke proximal DVT eligible study complete 6 month LMWH ( therapeutic dosage first month , dose reduce 25 % remain 5 month ) . Provoked DVTs define thrombotic episode associated pregnancy puerperium , recent ( i.e . within three month ) fracture plaster casting leg , immobilization confinement bed three consecutive day surgery general anesthesia lasting longer 30 minute . Unprovoked DVTs define thrombotic episode occur apparently absence risk factor cancer . Patients know thrombophilia , serious liver disease , renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min . ) live far center exclude study . The study approve institutional review board participate center . All enrol patient provide write informed consent . STUDY DESIGN . This multicenter prospective study cancer patient first episode symptomatic ( either provoke idiopathic ) proximal DVT detect Compression UltraSonography ( C-US ) receive LMWH 6 month . At time , subject agree participate study physical examination ass baseline clinical condition exclude contraindication . C-US proximal deep vein system legs perform , measure diameter detectable thrombus Common Femoral Vein ( CFV ) Popliteal Veins ( PV ) . Images obtain transverse section . Lumen compressibility evaluate CFV PV gentle pressure probe , previously describe . Briefly , major minor diameter vein segment measure recorded compression . C-US finding score `` absence RVT '' residual thrombus occupy , maximum compressibility , le 40 % vein area . Patients without RVT continue anticoagulation , whereas RVT randomize either stop continue LMWH additional 6 month . A different randomization sequence different study site computer generate encapsulated randomization computer program . The sequence balance block ten . STUDY OUTCOMES AND FOLLOW-UP . From assignment visit , patient follow least one year LMWH discontinuation ; follow-up period , patient contact clinical center every 3 month . C-US perform recurrent symptomatic DVT suspect . The study outcome composite confirm recurrent venous thromboembolism ( include DVT and/or fatal non-fatal pulmonary embolism ) major bleed event index DVT last day follow-up . In case suspect DVT recurrence result C-US compare previous examination . A diagnosis recurrent venous thrombosis make previously fully compressible segment ( contralateral ipsilateral ) become incompressible . In absence previous normal C-US , DVT recurrence diagnose previously non-occlusive thrombus shift occlusive thrombus , provide vein area compression increase 50 % ) ; undetermined case , contrast venography perform . In patient suspected pulmonary embolism , diagnosis recurrence base objective algorithm use clinical probability , ventilation-perfusion lung scanning/helical compute tomography , C-US and/or D-dimer indicate . The diagnosis clinically relevant haemorrhage make case decrease haemoglobin level &gt; 2.0 gr/dl , retroperitoneal , intracranial life-threatening . Patients instructed contact clinical center immediately symptoms developed suggestive venous thromboembolism bleed . All suspect outcome event death evaluate central adjudication committee whose member unaware name subject , enrol center , C-US finding assign group . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS . The sample size calculate consider , group bad prognosis ( A1 , A2 B ) incidence recurrent venous thromboembolism 20 % , percentage complication 5 % group best prognosis . An overall sample size 300 patient ( 100 study group ) calculate reach power 80 % document difference least 15 % least one different head-to-head comparison , use Bonferroni method distribute type I error ( 0.05 ) among multiple comparison . An interim analysis plan inclusion 200 patient . The chi square test 95 % confidence interval use evaluate difference recurrence VTE bleeding group . A multivariable analysis logistic regression model perform identify risk factor predictive recurrence VTE . The model logistic regression apply possible category patient , idiopathic post-operative DVT . The planned duration enrollment phase 3 year .</detailed_description>
