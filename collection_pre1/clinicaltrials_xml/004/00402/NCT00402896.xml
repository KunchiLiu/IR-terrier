	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn effect ZD6474 amount time placement indwell pleural catheter catheter 's removal patient malignant pleural effusion . This study also look effect ZD6474 tumor cell , biological characteristic cell body , rate fluid build-up around lung , tumor size , thickness blood vessel . The effect drug quality life shortness breath also examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Malignant Pleural Effusion With ZD6474</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZD6474 investigational drug yet receive approval FDA . ZD6474 design limit VEGF . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) consider play key role development pleural effusion . Pleural effusion abnormal collection pleural fluid pleural line surround lung . The pleural lining thin cover protects cushion lung . It make two layer tissue separate small amount fluid . ZD6474 show promising activity number cancer laboratory test animal cancer early clinical trial patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ZD6474 also demonstrate significant reduction pleural effusion association VEGF inhibition tumor cell mice lung tumor pleural effusion . It hop ZD6474 decrease amount pleural effusion occur NSCLC patient . In addition , ZD6474 think block formation new blood vessel , may limit new blood vessel growth tumor `` starve '' tumor . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . You ask question ability perform daily activity ( performance status evaluation ) . You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You may 3 electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . You also chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest measure status disease . You ask fill 2 questionnaire quality life shortness breath . The questionnaire take 10-15 minute , total , complete . Women able child must negative blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . If find eligible participate study , indwell intrapleural catheter place . You sign separate consent document placement indwell intrapleural catheter perform . The pleural fluid collect clinic visit . The fluid save analyzed answer research question part study . You also need drain pleural fluid everyday . The research nurse provide instruction drain daily pleural fluid patient `` diary '' take home record amount fluid drain every day . The study doctor research nurse review diary clinic visit . After placement intrapleural catheter ( Day 1 ) , receive treatment ZD6474 . Treatment study 10 week . You take ZD6474 tablet mouth morning . The tablet chew , crush , divide , take 8 ounce water . You take tablet time every day . During participation study , physical exam , routine blood test chest x-ray Weeks 2 , 6 , 10 . At Weeks 6 10 , also CT scan . You ECG Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 . Your doctor may decide additional ECGs monitor condition experience heart rate le 50 time study participation . You also ask complete 2 questionnaire quality life shortness breath experience . You complete questionnaire home return research staff clinic visit . You ask record weekly blood pressure first 6 week study treatment . The study doctor research nurse review log clinic visit . If benefit study treatment doctor feel best interest , may continue receive study drug longer 10 week . During participation extend treatment phase , every 4 week physical exam performance status evaluate . You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 4 week , ECGs perform . You also chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest measure status disease every 8 week . Your study drug continue provide . You may take study early intolerable side effect disease get bad . This investigational study . ZD6474 , investigational drug use study , approve FDA commercial use ; however , FDA permit use research study . Up 25 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

Diagnosis postobstructive pneumonia serious infection 14 day prior registration 6 . Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule 7 . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease concurrent condition Investigator 's opinion make undesirable patient participate trial would jeopardize compliance protocol 8 . Clinically significant cardiovascular event Myocardial infarction ; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification heart disease &gt; /=2 within 3 month entry ; presence cardiac disease opinion Investigator increase risk ventricular arrhythmia 9 . History arrhythmia ( multifocal premature ventricular contraction ( PVCs ) , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation ) symptomatic require treatment ( CTCAE grade 3 ) asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia . Atrial fibrillation , control medication exclude 10 . Previous history correct QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation medication require discontinuation medication 11 .
