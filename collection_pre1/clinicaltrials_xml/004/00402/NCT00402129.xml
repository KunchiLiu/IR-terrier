	<brief_title>Low Fluence 1064nm Laser Hair Reduction Pseudofolliculitis Barbae Skin Types IV , V , VI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pseudofolliculitis barbae ( PFB ) acneiform eruption beard area usually see dark-skinned individual thick , tightly curl hair . Typically , hair shaft curve back directly adjacent skin shaft penetrate follicular epithelium superficial dermis . The subsequent foreign body inflammatory reaction lead discomfort , pigment alteration , infection , scar potential decreased ability shave . PFB continue significant problem military tremendous cost US Government , direct treatment condition well indirectly due loss man-hours personnel training , clinic visit , ultimately , administrative separation . Chemical depilatory , topical corticosteroid , topical retinoids , topical antibiotic , eflornithine hydrochloride cream helpful management PFB . Growing beard usually curative ; however military clean shaven face require . Since 1984 , US Navy allow wear beard , note facial hair may interfere proper fit protective gear use biochemical warfare agent , case oxygen mask breathe apparatus . In refractory case , permanent laser hair removal long-pulse Nd : YAG show decrease severity PFB dark skin individual . This wavelength safe , effective , due increase penetration , allow increase ratio hair bulb epidermal heating patient Fitzpatrick skin type IV VI . Traditional 1064nm laser fluences ( define 22-40 J/cm2 ) normal beard subject produce significant discomfort . Blistering subsequent pigmentary change report patient type V-VI skin.7 Patients often require topical anesthesia prolong application time , range 45 90 minute . Treatments usually schedule every four six week military , conduct train physician major treatment facility . Theoretically , aim 1064nm laser treatment long lasting permanent hair reduction via conductive thermal diffusion cause lethal damage hair bulb bulge area melanosome-containing hair shaft matrix . However , patient treat high possible fluence eventually become symptomatic within 12 18 month final treatment . The purpose study determine PFB could mitigate weekly treatment protocol . We evaluate a1064nm Nd : YAG laser use fluence 12J/cm2 patient PFB Fitzpatrick skin type IV , V VI .</detailed_description>
