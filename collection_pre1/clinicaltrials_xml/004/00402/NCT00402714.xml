	<brief_summary>This study explore use reduce intensity transplant condition regimen . A conditioning regimen treatment give prepare body new bone marrow receive donor . Reduced intensity conditioning use low dos chemotherapy conventional conditioning regimen . The use low dos drug radiation cause few side effect . Reduced intensity regimens offer old patient patient increase risk transplant-related side effect show safe effective . Reduced intensity conditioning regimen consider many patient undergo transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Extracorporeal Photopheresis , Pentostatin , Total Body Irradiation Patients Undergoing Reduced Intensity Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Treatment Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One complication allogeneic stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . This donor cell infused attack body organs . This cause serious illness even death . The chance get serious life threaten GVHD conventional transplant conditioning regimens 25-50 % depend whether donor bone marrow family member unrelated person . The reduced intensity condition regimen use study involve drug call pentostatin well reduce dose radiation treatment call photopheresis . This regimen successfully use 106 patient . The incidence serious GVHD patient much less expect : 8 % patient get bone marrow family member 23 % get bone marrow unrelated person . The pentostatin radiation part reduce intensity condition regimen similar type reduce intensity regimen , use drug similar pentostatin . The unique part regimen compare others use extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) . While ECP use 106 patient part reduce intensity condition regimen , unknown whether add ECP pentostatin radiation cause reduced rate GVHD see previous study do . The use ECP part condition regimen investigational . ECP approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , approve FDA use prior ASCT . Because known whether use ECP reduce intensity conditioning regimen cause low incidence GVHD , research study look difference get GVHD base whether receive ECP . Half patient research study receive ECP part reduce intensity-conditioning regimen half . Patients randomize ( 50 % chance receive ECP 50 % chance ) . Both group receive pentostatin reduce dose total body irradiation . The primary purpose research study look chance develop serious GVHD within first 100 day transplant within group .</detailed_description>
