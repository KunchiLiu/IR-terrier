	<brief_summary>Patients , consider suitable physician take part research , physical examination ( include Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ) , blood urine sample take , well sample secretion tissue around infection site . In addition , site infection photograph . The patient randomly assign one treatment : intravenous ( IV ) /per oral ( PO ) moxifloxacin ( drug evaluation ) IV piperacillin/tazobactam follow PO amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ( i.e. , one reference treatment kind infection ) . The maximum treatment duration 21 day , minimum 7 day . During hospitalization , patient physical examination every day . On Day 3-5 therapy well end treatment , patient repeat examination . These test evaluation repeat 14 28 day end treatment . During visit , blood urine sample take judged necessary physician .</brief_summary>
