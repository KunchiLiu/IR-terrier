	<detailed_description>- After screen test confirm participant eligibility , study treatment begin . - Prior start study medication port-a-cath insert . This do operating room require separate consent form . During treatment needle insert port-a-cath chemotherapy give . If participant choose port-a-cath , need hospitalize Brigham Women 's Hospital receive chemotherapy ( approximately 5 day ) . - Participants receive three cycle chemotherapy . Each cycle treatment last 21 day . On day 1 cycle , receive cetuximab intravenously 2 hour , docetaxel ( Taxotere ) intravenously 1 hour , cisplatin intravenously 1 hour , 5-FU period 96 hour infusion pump . On day 8 15 cycle , participant receive another dose cetuximab intravenously one hour . - Not everyone participates study receive amount 5-FU . A small group participant give certain dose 5-FU continuous 4 day infusion . If tolerate well , next group people receive high dose 5-FU . This continue find high dose drug give safely . - Participants see week clinic physical exam . At time vital sign check participant ask general question health specific question problem might experience . Blood test also perform time . - Within two week completion third cycle chemotherapy , participant return clinic evaluation . The following exam procedure perform : Physical exam ; blood test ; image tumor ( CT , MRI PET ) ; exam anesthesia ( EUA ) . - Once participant complete treatment , would like follow-up regard status cancer .
