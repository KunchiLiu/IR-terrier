	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination everolimus imatinib slow growth cause reduction size cancer , determine side effect combination patient melanoma . Each drug combination , use alone , would expect effect cancer . However , use together , possibility could work together damage cancer cell , block formation function blood vessel fee cancer , either could result slow growth shrink cancer . Both drug work block signal send outside cell inside cell direct cell make certain substance keep cell alive . Cancer cell blood vessel fee cancer cell may sensitive drug block signal .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm stage III unresectable stage IV metastatic melanoma . Patients must measurable disease define RECIST criterion . Patients 1 prior cytotoxic regimen metastatic disease eligible . There prior limitation adjuvant therapy stage II/III disease patient stage IV disease treat resection metastatic disease . There prior limitation biological hormonal therapy ( immune therapy , interferon , hypomethylating agent , histone deacetylase inhibitor , etc . ) , however , patient previously treat mTOR inhibitor exclude . Prior treatment metastatic disease require . Patients must recover acute toxicity prior treatment . Chronic toxicity must recover ≤ grade 1 . The minimum interval prior treatment first day dose trial follow : standard cytotoxic agent radiation therapy , 21 day ; mitomycin nitrosoureas , 6 week ; hormonal immunotherapy agent , 2 week ; minor surgery , 2 week , major surgery , 3 week ; investigational agent 4weeks . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use everolimus combination imatinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric phase 1 combination trial . ECOG performance status &lt; 1 . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/μL ; Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/ μL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/ μL ; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 gm/dL ( may transfuse level ) ; PT/PTT &lt; 1.5x upper limit normal ; Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3X institutional upper limit normal ; Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73m2 The effect everolimus imatinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 3 month stop study drug . Should woman ( partner man participate trial ) become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients may receive prior treatment cancer mTOR inhibitor . Patients know brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients previously treat brain metastasis , long require steroid , evidence progression least 8 week follow treatment know brain metastasis , eligible . Baseline diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg . Blood pressure medication may use bring diastolic pressure level acceptable protocol enrollment . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , ventricular cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction within previous 6 month , dyspnea rest , active GI bleeding ulcer disease , diabetes mellitus , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study everolimus imatinib agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother everolimus imatinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treat protocol . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Known HIVpositive patient , potential pharmacokinetic interaction everolimus imatinib , potential immunosuppressive action everolimus may increase progression infectious complication HIV . Appropriate study undertake HIVpositive patient indicate . Patients receive warfarin ( see section 5.2 ) , chronic treatment steroid another immunosuppressive agent . In addition , patient require follow agent exclude study , must take agent trial : ketoconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , clarithromycin , dexamethasone , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , Phenobarbital , St. John 's Wort , simvastatin , HMGCoA reductase inhibitor ( metabolize CYP3A4 ) , cyclosporine , pimozide , triazolobenzodiazepines , dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , acetaminophen acetaminophen contain product Percoset Vicodin . Patients take CYP3A4 interact agent narrow therapeutic window exclude trial . Patient &lt; 5 year free another primary malignancy except : primary malignancy currently clinically significant require active intervention , primary malignancy basal cell skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . Existence malignant disease allow .</criteria>
