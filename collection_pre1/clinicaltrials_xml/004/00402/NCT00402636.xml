	<brief_title>Rapamycin+Estradiol- vs. Rapamycin-Eluting Stents Reduce Restenosis ( ISAR-PEACE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery reblockage remain still drawback percutaneous coronary intervention even era drug-eluting stent ( DES ) . DESs work principle consist delivery control amount antiproliferative agent local level , result suppression neontimal proliferation , main cause lumen re-narrowing stent implantation . At present , several DES platform develop evaluated clinical use . They differ regard stent type , anti-proliferative drug , presence absence polymer employ drug storage modification drug-release kinetics well type polymer use purpose . Although mid-term efficacy well-established , ongoing debate potential increase incidence late stent thrombosis , particularly discontinuation thienopyridine therapy , well delay onset restenosis catch-up phenomenon DESs . Based animal human pathological data , investigator link above-mentioned concern presence permanent polymer DESs , proinflammatory prothrombogenic potential , sometimes may induce hypersensitivity reaction . On hand , lack delay reendothelialization consider important factor development coronary reblockage . Estradiol show promote rapid reendothelialization stent reduce restenosis PCI . This trial compare anti-restenotic efficacy polymer-free rapamycin plus 17β estradiolvalerat -eluting stent polymer-free rapamycin-eluting stent patient coronary artery disease . The ISAR stent rough surface stainless steel stent allow coat without need polymer ( PF ISAR stent ) cath lab .</detailed_description>
