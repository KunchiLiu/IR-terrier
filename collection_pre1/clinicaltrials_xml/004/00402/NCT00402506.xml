	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Confirm Cardioprotective Effects MC-1 Patients Undergoing High-Risk CABG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) effectively relieve angina , result longer survival , good quality life specific subgroup patient obstructive coronary artery disease . Due high incidence coronary artery disease worldwide , well effectiveness surgical procedure , CABG surgery make one top ten frequently perform procedure North America Europe . In United States estimate approximately 467,000 CABG procedure perform 2003 . Despite benefit CABG surgery , patient undergoing procedure may also suffer serious adverse outcome include operative mortality , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , ventricular failure , life-threatening arrhythmia , renal insufficiency , stroke . Some propose cause cardiovascular morbidity mortality CABG include perioperative ischemia , inadequate myocardial protection reperfusion injury . The impact serious complication significant . Incidence rate death MI follow CABG surgery range 5 % 12 % depend risk status . Results large clinical trial recently demonstrate importance neurologic deficit problematic outcome CABG . These deficit include memory impairment , psychomotor , visuospatial , attention language ability measure neuropsychological test well sensorimotor abnormality associate stroke . MC-1 naturally occur metabolite vitamin B6 . Evidence pre-clinical clinical study suggest MC-1 protects heart ischemic damage ischemia-reperfusion injury . This trial ass cardioprotective effect MC-1 compare placebo patient undergo high-risk CABG surgery .</detailed_description>
