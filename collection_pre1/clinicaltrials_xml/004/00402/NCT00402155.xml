	<detailed_description>Wilkins et al ( 1980 ) find paroxysmal activity photosensitive epileptic patient trigger binocular view large repetitive strip pattern spatial frequency 1-4 cycle deg-1 , contrast 10 % , duty cycle 50 % . Sensitivity visual pattern varies non-epileptic population ( Wilkins et al , 1984 ) produce unpleasant somatic ( e.g. , eye-strain , headache ) perceptual effect ( e.g. , flicker , color illusion ) . This condition term visual discomfort ( Wilkins et al. , 1984 ) visual stress ( Wilkins , 1995 ) . Reading especially difficult visual discomfort print text repetitive strip pattern characteristic cause visual discomfort ; , spatial frequency 1-6 cycle deg-1 ( Legge et al. , 1985 ) , high contrast , 50 % duty cycle ( Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith , 1984 ; 1987 ) . Those visual discomfort report variety symptom read , , movement print , blurring , letter distortion ( size , double , fade darken ) , pattern appear white space , color illusion letter highlight move blob , nausea , dizziness , headache , eye-strain , glare discomfort ( Wilkins , 2003 ) . One study ( Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith , 1987 ) find decrease duty cycle ( double triple space line text ) sufficient reduce eliminate unpleasant symptom . Symptom frequency read appear vary person 's sensitivity strip pattern ( Conlon et al. , 1998 ) common among suffer headache migraine ( Wilkins et al , 1984 ; Conlon et al. , 1999 ) . Effective reading time considerably reduce visual discomfort symptom ( Conlon et al , 1998 ; Conlon et al , 1999 , Wilkins , 2003 ) . Most college student visual discomfort read hour time without take break ( Conlon et al. , 1999 ) . Very little know symptom frequency read problem associate visual discomfort . Conlon et al ( 1999 ) conduct study use symptom questionnaire publish validity reliability . The scale consist 23 item sample wide variety visual symptom associate read use four point rating scale . The internal consistency scale high ( Cronbach alpha = .91 ) , several experiment confirm scale could predict unpleasant symptom frequency performance efficiency reading . The scale normed sample 515 college student volunteer Australia . Individuals rat low , moderate , severe discomfort base total rating score 35 % , 35-69.5 % , 70 % , respectively . Twelve percent classify severe 35 % moderate . Experiments sample normative group conduct validate scale . They check normal correct normal visual acuity screen concomitant condition , oculomotor dysfunction learn disability . The frequently report symptom include text movement , appearance color , eye-strain . Headache , dizziness visual distortion report infrequently . Oral read rate highly correlate ( r = .71 ) visual discomfort score . Conlon ( personal communication ) find individual visual discomfort read silently normal rate comprehension suffers , whereas oral reading rate impaired comprehension good . Mechanisms Visual Discomfort . Three different mechanism propose could induce visual discomfort reading . A . Noisy visual system . Working model visual epilepsy , Wilkins ( 1986 ) propose visual discomfort cause hypersensitivity cortical cell share sensitivity particular spatial frequency orientation . Several study examine contrast sensitivity function ( CSF ) high visual discomfort individual find weak sensitivity intermediate ( Wilkins et al. , 1984 ) sometimes high spatial frequency ( Conlon , Lovegrove , Barker , &amp; Chekaluk , 2001 ) . A recent pilot study ten child visual discomfort find difference visual evoke potential ( VEP ) amplitudes among history headache migraine ( Riddell , Wilkins , &amp; Hainline , 2006 ) . These result interpret evidence great noise visual system . Prolonged exposure single spatial frequency think increase localized cortical excitation spread adjacent cell different spatial frequency channel . This spread cortical activation cause unpleasant symptom . Studies Wilkins colleague ( 1984 ) show common spatial frequency unpleasant symptom occur 4 cycle deg-1 - peak contrast sensitivity function . Conlon et al . ( 1999 ) present similar cortical model visual discomfort cause 'noise ' due poor inhibitory connection spatial frequency channel . B . Accommodative Vergence Insufficiency . Visual discomfort symptom also association convergence accommodative insufficiency child ( Evans et al , 1995 ; Evans et al , 1996 ; Borsting et al. , 1999 ; 2003 , 2004 ) . Convergence Insufficiency ( CI ) , difficulty maintain binocular fusion approach object , define one clinical sign include : exophoria near great distance , decrease positive fusional vergence , near point convergence recede . The prevalence CI school-aged child vary 4-8 % depend presence two three CI sign ( Rouse et al. , 1997 ; Rouse et al. , 1999 ) . Accommodative insufficiency ( AI ) , difficulty maintain focus approach target , often associate CI . Borsting et al . ( 2003 ) find 40 % school-aged child AI also CI , almost 80 % three sign CI AI . Borsting et al ( 2003 ) find child normal binocular vision average symptom score 3.8 , whereas three-sign CI AI child report significantly symptom , average 6.7 6.4 , respectively . Recently , Rouse et al ( 2004 ) administer revise version Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey ( CISS ) 46 adult CI 46 normal binocular vision ass reliability validity . The CISS 15 item 4-point Likert survey quantifies severity symptom score range 0 60 . The mean CISS score CI normal group 37.3 11.0 , respectively . The interclass correlation coefficient 0.89 , 95 % limit agreement -9.0 7.6 indicate good excellent reliability . These result raise question CI AI adult visual discomfort symptom suggest oculomotor dysfunction could possible cause disorder . A comparison several item Conlon 's Visual Discomfort Survey CISS show strike similarity suggest two survey measure similar symptomatology . C. Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration . The focal characteristic accommodative response also affect longitudinal chromatic aberration ( Kruger et al. , 1995 ; Lee et al. , 1999 ; Stark et al. , 2002 ; Rucker &amp; Kruger , 2004 ; Rucker &amp; Kruger 2006 ) . When L/M-cone contrast ratio stimulus high , mean accommodation level decrease , bias response towards far ; S-cone stimulus contrast bias response towards near ( Stark et al. , 2002 ; Rucker &amp; Kruger , 2004 ) . A low-pass filter reduces accommodation demand 0.50 D ( Kroger &amp; Binder , 2000 ) , read performance tends well blue transmit filter ( Solman , Cho , &amp; Dain , 1991 ; Williams , Lecluyse , &amp; Rock-Fauchex , 1992 ; Solan , 1998 ; Iovino et al. , 1998 ; Edwards &amp; Hogben , 1999 ; Ray , Fowler , &amp; Stein , 2005 ) , whereas diffuse red light impairs reading ( Chase et al. , 2003 ) . Children high L/M ratio sensitivity poorer reader ( Chase et al. , press ) . This L/M ratio variation may affect accommodative response interfere text perception . Wilkins et al . ( 2005 ) find individual benefit color filter read prefer specific hue saturation , perhaps compensate individual accommodative bias . Ray et al . ( 2005 ) report high proportion ( 39 % ) reading-impaired child poor accommodation . The use yellow filter significantly may normalize accommodative response balance L- M-cone input ( Stromeyer et al. , 1997 ; Stromeyer et al. , 2000 ) , read skill improve use yellow filter placebo . Simmers et al . ( 2001 ) find significantly high variability low frequency component accommodative response function among five subject visual discomfort symptom . This variability decrease normal level color filter use luminance reduce . To explore alternative hypothesis , administer Visual Discomfort Scale large sample student measure prevalence , severity symptom pattern problem college population . A stratified , random sample 100 student receive vision psycho-educational assessment screen concomitant condition might hamper read performance contribute symptom visual discomfort . Vision test include optometric exam ass accommodation vergence , CSF test noisy SF channel , electroretinogram ( ERG ) visual evoke potential ( VEP ) measure L/M cone sensitivity variation .</detailed_description>
