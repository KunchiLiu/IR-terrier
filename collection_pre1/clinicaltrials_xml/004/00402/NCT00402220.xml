	<brief_summary>The main treatment option Treatment Resistant Depression electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) often effective complicate cognitive side effect , need anaesthesia considerable stigma . In recent year considerable effort make increase public awareness depression increase access service . However , increase number patient access treatment depression clinical service also likely accompany sizeable increase number patient TRD . Despite demand , relatively treatment option available patient . One substantially new treatment develop TRD recent year advent repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . Repetitive TMS evaluate 20 trial conduct last 10 year . Previous research indicate rTMS antidepressant activity ; however , proportion patient respond rTMS degree treatment response demonstrate trial date limit . The limitation study include relatively small sample limited duration treatment ( i.e. , 2 week ) well lack long term follow-up . As rTMS gradually enter use routine clinical practice ( example , recent regulation use Canada ) , research urgently require establish way enhance treatment response regard extent response within individual proportion individual rTMS effect . Stimulation site another important treatment factor ; thus far almost trial rTMS TRD conduct evaluated utility high frequency leave prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) rTMS ( HFL-TMS ) . In addition , several study evaluate treatment efficacy low frequency rTMS right PFC ( LFR-TMS ) . In previously publish study demonstrate two approach similar therapeutic benefit superior sham stimulation . A promising new approach enhance efficacy involve combine LFR-TMS HFL-TMS sequential manner . We describe sequential bilateral rTMS ( SB-rTMS ) . We recently publish result first substantial evaluation SB-rTMS showing superiority placebo TRD also therapeutic response substantially superior response rate publish study unilateral rTMS ( &gt; 50 % patient achieve standard criterion clinical response compare usually &lt; 30 % study ) . In propose research study , directly test hypothesis SB-rTMS produce great therapeutic response HFL-TMS compare form stimulation placebo ( i.e. , sham ) stimulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double-Blind Sham Controlled Trial rTMS Treatment Resistant Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification project TRD clearly major health issue - depression common , result mark morbidity mortality large percentage patient respond , tolerate standard treatment . The development new treatment condition undoubtedly require . International effort underway try establish efficacy HFL-TMS point technique may approve regulatory authority clinically introduce . However , clearly response rate HFL-TMS suboptimal widespread use . The overall goal research program develop rTMS method point highly relevant applicable clinical practice . None substantial international study focus novel application SBrTMS . As outcome , expect positive result change focus rTMS application practice nationally internationally . If follow well receive initial study technique substantial comparative trail plan , provide enough evidence widespread adoption test SBrTMS viable alternative HFL-TMS . Ultimately , modification , may become rTMS administration method choice . Additionally , sufficient sample size start explore meaningful predictor clinical response include biological , psychosocial/personality variable predictor . Hypotheses / Research Questions Primary Hypothesis - Hypothesis 1 : Treatment leave sided SBrTMS result great reduction HAMD MADRS score sham rTMS . - Hypothesis 2 : Treatment SBrTMS result great reduction HAMD MADRS score leave sided rTMS apply alone . Secondary Hypotheses â€¢ Greater 50 % treatment responder rTMS continue experience clinical benefit rTMS , indexed persistently low HAMD MADRS score , 6 month post acute treatment . Methodology include project design sequence procedure Experimental Design The study involve 2 phase treatment : acute treatment phase 3-9 week duration maintenance treatment phase , last 52 week . In initial 3 week acute treatment phase study randomise , double blind sham-controlled three arm : 1 . SBrTMS 2 . Unilateral leave rTMS 3 . Sham rTMS Prior randomization , participant undergo EEG MRI ( see detail ) . The EEG MRI repeat active treatment phase . Randomization occur via generation single computer number sequence . Subjects randomise immediately prior commencement first treatment session , measurement bilateral rest motor threshold standard mean [ 30 ] . Acute treatment administer daily , 5 day per week initially three week ( i.e . 15 treatment ) . Following 3 week treatment response assess blind broken . At point non responder ( i.e . HAM-D score &gt; 10 ) receive active treatment offer additional 3 week treatment treatment parameter . Responders receive active treatment enter maintenance phase . At week 6 treatment response assess non responder offer final 3 week active treatment responder enter maintenance phase . At week 9 response assess non responder cease participation trial , responder continue onto maintenance phase . With regard sham treatment arm , subject respond treatment receive sham treatment discontinue study week 3 . Those subject classify non responder sham treatment arm randomise one two active treatment arm receive additional 3 week active treatment . The maintenance phase open label consist weekly treatment parameter patient initially respond , total 8 week . Maintenance treatment reduce fortnightly treatments 44 week . Patients evaluate clinically every 2 week . Should patient relapse ( i.e . HAM-D score &gt; 15 2 consecutive week ) , offer active treatment ( i.e . sham treatment ) six week stimulus parameter previously experience response . Subjects Inclusion Criteria : Patients include : 1 . Have DSM-IV diagnosis major depressive episode ( SCID 11 ) . 2 . Aged 18-85 . 3 . Have treatment resistant depression Stage II Thase Rush classification [ 31 ] ; .e . fail achieve clinical response , tolerate , least two separate antidepressant trial sufficient dose least 6 week . 4 . Have Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score &gt; 20 ( moderate - severe depression ) . Including severely ill group subject limit placebo response rate [ 32 ] . Moreover , allow u address application rTMS method clinically relevant subgroup patient ( addition help constrain group heterogeneity , major issue depression research ) . 5 . Have increase initiation new antidepressant ( psychoactive ) therapy 4 week prior screen . Additional Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Patients unstable medical condition , neurological disorder history seizure disorder currently pregnant lactating . 2 . In opinion investigator , sufficient suicidal risk require immediate electro-convulsive therapy . 3 . Have current DSM IV diagnosis substance abuse dependence disorder , diagnosis personality disorder ( SCID II ) another axis 1 disorder . Please note : several criterion ( e.g . inclusion criterion 1 &amp; 2 , exclusion criterion 3 ) select explicitly constrain heterogeneity sample increase likely power study detect difference group give potentially subtle difference treatment method . Sample Size Calculations We aim recruit 40 patient group ( total n=120 ) . The sample size calculation study conduct base within group standard deviation 12.9 ( standard deviation baseline final study visit SBrTMS study ) group difference 5.0 point . With alpha 0.05 study power 0.87 detect difference end score 3 group ( calculation PASS 8.0 ) . Clinical Measures Demographic variables potential co-variates record baseline follow clinical interview . These include duration current episode , year first diagnosis , number previous episode , type dose current previous treatment family history mood disorder . Clinical measure perform randomization , 3 6 week ( 9 week patient extension phase ) well follow assessment . A trained rater blind treatment type administer measure . Raters require maintain &gt; 90 % reliability primary outcome assessment rating 6 monthly assessment base videotaped interview . To ensure comparability previous study , primary outcome variable 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD ) . Other outcome measure include Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Beck Depression Questionnaire ( BDI ) , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) interview record subjective experience TMS adverse event . Final response remission rate measure use standard rating scale score criterion patient need achieve score study end 2 week follow assessment . Assessments make baseline explore potential predictor clinical response include CORE rating melancholia [ 33 ] , Measure Parental Styles [ 34 ] , Depressive Personality Inventory [ 35 ] Costello Comrey trait anxiety measure [ 36 ] . A battery cognitive test administer prior commencement 3 , 6 9 week active treatment phase specific focus attention memory : HVLT , Controlled oral word association , Trail make A &amp; B , Digit Span The inclusion measure assess potential beneficial effect TMS frontally mediate cognitive function well act safety check . TMS Treatment TMS administer Medtronic Magpro30 magnetic stimulator use 70mm figure 8 coil . Prior commencement treatment TMS , single pulse TMS use measure rest motor threshold ( RMT ) abductor pollicis brevis ( APB ) bilaterally subject use standard publish method [ 30 ] . Stimulation parameter rTMS administer daily basis 5 day per week subject : Bilateral : Left : 10Hz , 100 % RMT , 30 Trains , 5 second duration , 25 second inter-train interval Right : 1 Hz , 100 % RMT , 1 Train 600 pulse Left Unilateral : Left : 10Hz , 100 % RMT , 30 Trains , 5 second duration , 25 second inter-train interval Right : , BUT , apply Medtronic sham coil Sham : follow applied sham coil Left : 10Hz , 100 % RMT , 30 Trains , 5 second duration , 25 second inter-train interval Right : 1 Hz , 100 % RMT , 1 Train 600 pulse Missed session 'made ' extension treatment duration one miss session allow weekly one miss session row . Stimulation localisation This follow standard procedure . Firstly , site optimal activation abductor pollicis brevis muscle contralateral hand locate whilst stimulate relevant motor cortical region supra-threshold intensity . This site mark scalp . We measure 6 cm anteriorly scalp surface mark ink . This point use site stimulation . The majority rTMS study measure 5 cm anteriorly . However , show result consistently localisation posterior dorsolateral PFC [ 37 ] . The measurement describe result consistent treatment dorsolateral PFC still provide considerable stimulation overlap establish ' 5 cm ' site . Imaging MRI image conduct commencement treatment ( subject ) end active treatment phase possible . Each subject undergo 3D sagittally orientate T1 weight structural MR scan 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner Alfred ( 128 slice ) . Analysis scalp cortex distance prefrontal cortex site stimulation conduct use previously publish method . This allow post hoc analysis relationship scalp cortex distance treatment response . In addition , possible subject undergo additional measure white matter tract integrity ( diffusion tensor image ) activation . None scan procedure involve administration contrast . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) EEG acute phase treatment use examine mean absolute spectral power within 5 frequency band . The mean absolute power ( square microvolt per hertz ) compute within follow 5 frequency band : delta ( 0.5-3.5 Hz ) , theta ( 3.5-7.5 Hz ) ; alpha ( 7.5-12.5 Hz ) ; beta 1 ( 12.5-20.5 Hz ) , beta 2 ( 20.5-32.5 Hz ) . EEG activation / spectral power assess rest ( eye open close ) cognitive engagement several task .</detailed_description>
