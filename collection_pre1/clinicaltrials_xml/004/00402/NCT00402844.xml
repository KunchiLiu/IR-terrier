	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse characterized lack pelvic floor support cause pelvic organ vaginal wall protrude . For decade , suture repair technique primary choice surgical treatment indicate . The notion reinforce pelvic floor defect use biomaterial implant exclusively contemporary idea . Traditional surgical technique frequently associate unsatisfying anatomical recurrence rate year sporadic attempt make introduce novel surgical technique use variety biomaterials support vary success . It plausible inherently weak , damage , pelvic floor supportive tissue need reinforce permanent support avoid high rate recurrence commonly describe use traditional technique . However , use biomaterials pelvic reconstructive surgery become widespread year despite lack clinical safety data , compel clinical evidence demonstrate improves outcomes compare traditional suture technique . It likely biomaterials need `` anchored '' tissue afflict disease , order provide intend pelvic floor support . This give rise transvaginal surgical technique use transobturator approach pass mesh arcus tendineous fascia pelvis , sacrospinous ligament transgluteal approach . Already commercially available implant material need patient safety documentation , consider surgical technique material place body well actual material . Complication rate perioperative morbidity use surgical route pelvic organ prolapse surgery generally unknown . The aim present study ass long term morbidity , describe complication , associate transvaginal mesh repair pelvic organ prolapse use PROLIFT®-system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair Using Transvaginal Mesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective : - To describe short long-term complication associate pelvic organ prolapse repair use macroporous polypropylene transvaginal mesh ( TVM ) use transobturator transgluteal approach . Secondary objective : - To describe anatomical restoration pelvic floor follow transvaginal mesh repair pelvic organ prolapse use Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system ( POP-Q ) . - To describe subjective patient outcome use validated questionnaire regard pelvic organ function ( UDI ) , sexual function ( PISQ ) quality life ( IIQ ) . Study design : - A prospective multicenter open label single cohort study . Study protocol : - At baseline patient receive oral write information study . - Following informed consent , patient include study pelvic organ prolapse surgery indicate inclusion , exclusion , criterion fulfil . - Preoperatively patient answer detail self report questionnaire health history , previous surgery , obstetrical history current disease medication . The questionnaire also include question symptom pelvic organ pelvic floor . - Preoperatively patient undergo clinical examination use POP-Q system , well , validate clinical inflammatory grade vaginal compartment . - Patients undergo TVM procedure standardise manner participate surgeon undergone pretrial surgical training adopt surgical technique . All patient receive standardise intraoperative antibiotic . - Complications immediate peri- postoperative hospital stay register hospital chart . - All patient receive clinical follow-up appointment 2 month , 1 year 3 year surgery . At follow-up identical self report questionnaire use subjective assessment . Clinical examination perform preoperatively sue POP-Q system macroscopic inflammatory grading . Complications register specific protocol hospital chart . - All protocol submit 2 month follow-up interrim safety analysis . The study chair responsible stop study rate , seriousness , complication exceed expect . - Patients free withdraw study point .</detailed_description>
