	<detailed_description>The recent emergence novel influenza virus strain human population encourage effort develop vaccine potential pandemic . The objective study evaluate safety intramuscular ( IM ) subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine healthy child age 2 10 year determine immunogenicity profile IM subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine healthy child approximately 1 month follow receipt second 2 dos vaccine . Study endpoint include : adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) information ( solicit in-clinic via memory aid , concomitant medication , periodic target physical assessment , indicate ) ; proportion subject achieve serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) ; geometric mean titer frequency 4-fold great increase hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) ; development serum antibody responses antigenically drifted variant influenza H5N1 virus . This study link DMID protocol 06-0072 . Up 55 healthy child , age 2 10 year , previously participate DMID 04-077 , eligible enrollment multimember , open-label , phase I/II clinical trial receive least 2 3 dos inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine 45-micrograms dose . The vaccine dosage level use study chosen base upon safety immunogenicity data collect previously adults child . The injection volume 90-micrograms dose 1 mL vaccine use study , consider unacceptable age group . Therefore , 45-micrograms dose ( 0.5 ml volume ) select . Twenty three subject previously enrol assign placebo DMID 04-077 study ( A Randomized , Double-Blinded , Placebo-Controlled , Phase I/II , Study Safety , Reactogenicity , Immunogenicity Intramuscular Inactivated Influenza A/H5N1 Vaccine Healthy Children Aged 2 Years Through 9 Years ) along 32 subject single site incompletely immunized eligible enrollment study . Vaccine administer deltoid ( age appropriate ) thigh muscle . All subject receive 2 dos vaccine approximately 28 day apart . At month 6 , subject ' parent ( ) guardian ( ) call assess subject serious adverse event . Blood collection immunogenicity study discretion parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) . Should data evaluate third dose influenza A/H5N1 vaccine show enhance immunogenicity pediatric subject participate DMID 04-077 , parents/guardians subject receive vaccine offer possibility third dose participate child .</detailed_description>
