	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Siltuximab Participants With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , non-randomized ( clinical trial participant assign chance different treatment group ) , prospective ( study follow participant forward time ) safety efficacy study siltuximab participant relapse refractory multiple myeloma . The study consist 3 Phases : Screening Phase ( first visit first dose study drug ) , Treatment Phase ( first dose end-of-treatment ) , Follow-up Phase ( end-of-treatment end study ) . The duration participation study individual participant 4 week Screening Phase , approximately 52 week Treatment Phase death , lose follow-up , withdraw consent end study , whichever , come first Follow-up Phase . Treatment administer 28-day cycle . The study design 2 alternative treatment plan . Treatment Plan A : first 2 cycle siltuximab administer alone , dexamethasone may add treatment regimen base participant 's response treatment . Treatment Plan B : siltuximab dexamethasone combination duration study . The first 14 eligible participant follow Treatment Plan A data evaluation conduct participant 2 cycle treatment 2 post baseline disease assessment . If least one complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) observe 14 participant , subsequent participant follow Treatment Plan A . However , response ( CR PR ) observe , subsequent participant follow Treatment Plan B . The primary efficacy endpoint percentage participant overall response . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
