	<brief_title>Lycopene Omega-3 Fatty Acid Nutritional Supplements Treating Patients With Stage I Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare gene expression normal prostate tissue ( baseline treatment ) patient stage I II adenocarcinoma prostate treat lycopene vs omega-3 fatty acid nutritional supplement vs placebo . Secondary - Determine new candidate molecular target lycopene omega-3 response pathway . - Correlate baseline gene expression pattern , determine cDNA array analysis , self-reported dietary intake . - Correlate gene expression pattern progression lack progression 12 month study entry . - Determine lycopene omega-3 supplement affect incidence tumor progression . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord dietary intake tomato fish ( low tomato [ &lt; 4 servings/week ] , low fish [ &lt; 2 servings/week ] v low tomato , high fish [ ≥ 2 servings/week ] v high tomato [ ≥ 4 servings/week ] , low fish v high tomato , high fish ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients maintain normal diet receive oral omega-3 fatty acid placebo 3 time daily lycopene placebo twice daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral lycopene twice daily oral omega-3 fatty acid placebo 3 time daily . - Arm III : Patients receive oral lycopene placebo twice daily oral omega-3 fatty acid 3 time daily . In arm , treatment continue 90 day post-treatment biopsy schedule ( maximum 104 day ) absence disease progression . Patients complete dietary questionnaire baseline 3 day month study therapy . Quality life assess baseline 3 month . Prostate tissue needle biopsy blood sample collect baseline 3 month . Tissue blood sample examine lycopene omega-3 fatty acid ( treatment compliance ) , omega-6 fatty acid , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 , IGF bind protein-5 , cyclooxygenase-2 gene polymerase chain reaction , cDNA microarray hybridization , gene expression assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 114 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
