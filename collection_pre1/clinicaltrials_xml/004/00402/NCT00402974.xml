	<brief_summary>Background study : Results several study show vitamin K important function bone metabolism . In previous cross-sectional study conduct department , evidence poor vitamin K status bone growth child find ( unpublished data , accept publication Pediatric Research , october 2006 ) . These finding justify clinical intervention study bone quality monitor function long-term vitamin K-supplementation . Before long-term intervention study undertaken , important determine effect vitamin K administration osteocalcin carboxylation specific population . Although relationship increase vitamin K intake osteocalcin carboxylation already clearly demonstrated several adult group ( e.g . healthy adult , postmenopausal woman ) , never show child . Objective study : To study effect vitamin K-containing food supplement ( menaquinone 7 ) osteocalcin carboxylation healthy child 6 10 year age Netherlands . Study design : Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study . Study population : 55 healthy child ( boys girl ) 6 10 year , recruit primary school . Intervention : The subject randomise two group : - placebo group : 8 week , 27 child receive one tablet placebo- food supplement per day - treatment group : 8 week , 28 child receive one tablet food supplement per day contain 45 µg vitamin K2 . Primary study parameters/outcome study : Undercarboxylated ( ucOC ) carboxylate ( cOC ) fraction osteocalcin measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Both ucOC fraction ucOC/cOC ratio ( UCR ) sensitive indicator vitamin K status bone . Elevated level UCR indicative inferior vitamin K status bone . The main study parameter mean percentage change serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin ( ucOC ) UCR baseline ( t=0 ) endpoint ( t=8 week ) treatment group . Secondary study parameters/outcome study ( applicable ) : The secondary end point percentages change serum vitamin K level relation lipid metabolism marker baseline endpoint individual . Furthermore , percentages change serum BAP NTX baseline endpoint individual consider endpoint well .</brief_summary>
