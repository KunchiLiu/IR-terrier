	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subject must ≥ 18 year age . Subject ability cooperate study procedure agree return require followup visit , test exams . Female subject childbearing potential must document negative pregnancy test within 30 day prior index procedure . Subjects take warfarin may include dosage reduce index procedure result INR 1.5 less . Warfarin may restart therapeutic dose index procedure . The subject must sign write informed consent prior initiation study procedure , use form approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Medical Ethics Committee ( EC ) . The life expectancy subject least two year . The subject lesion locate internal carotid artery ( ICA ) ; carotid bifurcation may involve . The target lesion intend treat single stent . Target ICA vessel diameter must visually estimate : ≥2.5 mm ≤7.0 Emboshield Pro ( Gen 5 ) ≥ 2.8 mm ≤6.2 Emboshield ( Gen 3 ) And ≥4.0 mm ≤9.0 mm Xact Stent treatment area . The subject carotid artery stenosis determine ultrasound angiography ( visual estimate ) : ≥50 % symptomatic subject Or ≥80 % asymptomatic subject Highrisk inclusion criterion either anatomical comorbid risk factor present . The subject must fulfill least one criterion , Category I II risk factor , list meet inclusion criterion . Category I Anatomic Risk Factors Previous radiation treatment neck radical neck dissection Target lesion second vertebral body C2 ( level jaw ) Inability extend head due cervical arthritis cervical disorder Tracheostomy tracheal stoma Laryngectomy Contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy Severe tandem lesion Category II Comorbid Risk Factors Previous CEA significant restenosis ( define symptomatic asymptomatic subject ) Total occlusion contralateral carotid artery Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35 % Congestive Heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Functional Class III high Dialysis dependent renal failure Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification III higher unstable angina Requires coronary artery bypass surgery , cardiac valve surgery , peripheral vascular surgery , abdominal aortic aneurysm repair within 60 day •≥80 year age Myocardial infarction within previous 6 week Abnormal stress test . Treadmill , thallium dobutamine echo acceptable . The stress test sufficiently abnormal place subject increase risk CEA . This include subject two proximal diseased coronary artery &gt; 70 % stenosis revascularized &lt; 30 day since revascularization . Severe pulmonary disease , include least one following : require chronic O2 therapy ; rest PO2 ≤60 mm Hg , Hematocrit ≥50 % , FEV₁ DLCO ≤50 % normal . Exclusion Criteria The subject participate another investigational trial would interfere conduct result study . The subject dementia neurological illness may confound neurological evaluation . Total occlusion target vessel . There exist , previously place stent target artery . The subject know lifethreatening allergy contrast medium treat . Subject history intolerance allergic reaction study medication include aspirin , Clopidogrel bisulfate ( Plavix® ) Ticlopidine ( Ticlid® ) , heparin Bivalirudin ( Angiomax™ ) . Subjects must able tolerate combination aspirin Clopidogrel aspirin Ticlopidine . The subject GI bleed would interfere antiplatelet therapy . The subject know cardiac source emboli , include limited current past history paroxysmal sustain atrial fibrillation ( treat untreated ) , valve replacement , etc . Subject Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) less 8 gm/dL ( unless dialysis ) , platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3 , know heparin associate thrombocytopenia . The subject history bleed diathesis coagulopathy include thrombocytopenia inability receive heparin Bivalirudin ( Angiomax™ ) amount sufficient maintain ACT &gt; 250 , refuse blood transfusion . The subject atherosclerotic disease involve adjoin vessel precludes safe placement guide catheter sheath . The subject abnormal angiographic finding indicate subject risk stroke due problem target lesion , : ipsilateral arterial stenosis great severity target lesion , cerebral aneurysm , arteriovenous malformation cerebral vasculature . There evidence carotid artery dissection prior initiation index procedure . There angiographically visible thrombus . There condition precludes proper angiographic assessment , placement cerebral protective system make percutaneous arterial access unsafe , e.g . morbid obesity , sustain systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg , tortuosity , occlusive disease , vessel anatomy , aortic arch anatomy . Occlusion ( TIMI 0 flow ) , string sign ipsilateral common internal carotid artery . There evidence bilateral carotid stenosis would require intervention within 30 day index procedure . There evidence stroke within previous 30 day index procedure . There plan treatment nontarget lesion within 30 day postindex procedure . There history intracranial hemorrhage within previous 3 month , include hemorrhagic transformation ischemic stroke . There history ipsilateral stroke fluctuate neurologic symptom within one year index procedure .</criteria>
