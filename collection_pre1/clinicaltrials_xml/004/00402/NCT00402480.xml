	<detailed_description>The purpose study ass prospectively efficacy hydroxyurea therapy set cerebrovascular disease , manifest conditional abnormal transcranial doppler ultrasonography ( TCD ) flow velocity , child sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) . TCD use measure flow velocity intracranial artery marker increase stroke risk child SCA . The primary objective protocol determine whether hydroxyurea reduces elevate TCD velocity . The STOP ( Stroke Prevention Sickle Cell Anemia ) trial , multicenter , randomize , control trial primary stroke demonstrate monthly blood transfusion , compare observation alone , significantly reduce risk primary stroke child SCA whose TCD velocity exceed 200 cm/sec . Despite STOP trial 's clear result , unresolved issue regard TCD stroke risk child SCA . First , predictive value abnormal result compel since less third child abnormal TCD velocity even few conditional result ever develop clinical stroke . There also discordance TCD MRI result . Only 40 % child abnormal TCD velocity abnormality brain MRI ( Wang , et al . J Pediatr Hematol/Oncol 2000 ; 22 ( 4 ) :335-339 , Pegelow , et al . Arch Neurol 2001 ; 58:2017-2021 ) . There also well recognize risk chronic blood transfusion , include iron overload alloimmunization , necessary duration transfusion protection child abnormal TCD velocity unknown . Unfortunately , currently therapeutic option besides blood transfusion patient SCA abnormal TCD velocity . Erythrocyte transfusion hydroxyurea many similar beneficial effect patient SCA . Transfusions may prevent primary stroke lower % HbS , increase hematocrit , improve red cell rheology , decrease red cell adhesion , lower TCD velocity . Hydroxyurea lead many change , thus protocol , examine whether hydroxyurea , like transfusion , low TCD velocity . In patient SCA screen TCD ultrasonography , observed child screen receive hydroxyurea low TCD velocity measurement hydroxyurea . In small number patient TCD velocity measurement initiation hydroxyurea non-neurological reason , TCD velocity decline significantly achieve full dose hydroxyurea therapy . The change TCD velocity correlate change hematocrit since hydroxyurea increase blood count patient SCA . For % increase hematocrit , TCD velocity increase 6.3 cm/sec . This similar abstract STOP trial , TCD flow velocity decline 7.9 cm/sec increase % hematocrit transfusion . Based preliminary data , initiate prospective , single-institution , pilot trial determine whether hydroxyurea therapy lower TCD flow velocity child sickle cell anemia .</detailed_description>
