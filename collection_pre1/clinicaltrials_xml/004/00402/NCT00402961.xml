	<brief_title>Trial Acupuncture Reduction Post-Colectomy Ileus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To determine whether Phase III trial acupuncture postoperative recovery colorectal surgery warrant defined evidence reduction postoperative ileus compare sham acupuncture . - To explore whether acupuncture reduces length hospital stay sham acupuncture - To explore whether acupuncture improve patient satisfaction hospital experience ameliorate postoperative symptom pain nausea vomiting . - To determine feasibility Phase III trial term sample size , accrual rate , attrition rate data completion . Postoperative ileus contributes prolong hospital stay , readmission postoperative morbidity patient undergo major abdominal surgery . Reduction postoperative ileus important postoperative recovery . Postoperative pain may require opioids , reduce gastrointestinal ( GI ) motility . Postoperative nausea vomit hamper resumption oral intake . Together , three common postoperative problem contribute patient discomfort , delayed discharge increase overall hospitalization cost , despite current multi-modal management option . Any safe effective therapy addition current standard care would welcome patient , surgeon hospital . Acupuncture complementary medicine modality show reduce postoperative pain , suppress nausea vomiting , promote GI motility . It associate adverse event . Here propose randomize , sham control phase II study evaluate acupuncture , addition conventional therapy , safety effectiveness improve postoperative recovery colorectal cancer patient undergoing segmental subtotal colectomy . The overall objective developmental project determine whether extend research project warrant . The specific aim : - To determine whether Phase III trial acupuncture postoperative recovery colorectal surgery warrant defined evidence reduction postoperative ileus compare sham acupuncture . Hypothesis : acupuncture promote upper low GI motility patient experience postoperative ileus colectomy sham acupuncture . - To explore whether acupuncture improve patient satisfaction hospital experience ameliorate postoperative symptom pain nausea vomiting . Hypothesis 2a : acupuncture reduce postoperative pain placebo colectomy patient ; 2b : acupuncture reduce postoperative nausea vomit placebo colectomy patient . - To determine feasibility phase III trial term sample size , accrual rate , attrition rate data completion . Hypothesis 3 : phase III study acupuncture treatment post-colectomy ileus cancer patient feasible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman ethnicity Age 18 year ( child include colorectal cancer rare child ) . Scheduled undergo elective resection biopsy proven colorectal cancer suspect colorectal cancer Preoperative factor : History major abdominal pelvic surgery cause significant alteration anatomy function GI tract may affect endpoint study . Laparoscopic procedure . They tend result less postoperative ileus . Administration epidural anesthetic epidural opioids : previously show affect postoperative GI motility . They make 5 % colectomy patient investigator ' institution . Acupuncture within last 4 week ( exclude possible residual effect acupuncture ) Contraindications use electrical stimulation , include cardiac pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) Prior serious adverse event acupuncture Intraoperative event ( event alter postoperative recovery course significantly ) : Resection incorporate upper GI tract . Such surgery usually complex , involve organ associate diverse postoperative course , make study population heterogeneous . Gross fecal spillage ( high complication rate set ) Need leave nasogastric tube ( contaminate primary endpoint ) Decision give epidural anesthetic epidural opioids postoperatively ( show previously change major endpoint ) Complications surgery require patient transfer Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) directly Operating Room Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) also alter postoperative course significantly . Patients transfer floor first exclude . They fully register randomize . If deteriorate later hospital stay , require transfer ICU , still follow .</criteria>
