	<brief_title>Evaluating Association Between Pericardial Fat Coronary Heart Disease - Ancillary MESA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHD cause narrow small blood vessel supply blood oxygen heart . It usually result atherosclerosis , condition deposit fat , cholesterol , substance build along inner wall artery . Risk factor CHD include tobacco use , high blood pressure , diabetes , obesity . Visceral fat , type fat find abdomen surround vital organ , consider great risk factor CHD subcutaneous fat , type fat find directly skin . Pericardial fat , fat surround heart , similar visceral fat , may particularly damaging lipotoxicity effect ability trigger inflammation coronary artery . Increased amount pericardial fat may therefore accelerate development atherosclerosis CHD . The purpose study evaluate relationship pericardial fat development CHD . This study use previously collect data participant Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) study , study examine characteristic subclinical , early stage , cardiovascular disease individual . There study visit specifically study . Participants ' study data compute tomography ( CT ) scan analyzed determine following : 1 ) presence pericardial fat subclinical CHD study entry ; 2 ) change pericardial fat level plaque formation ; 3 ) presence pericardial fat CHD 6-year follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
