	<brief_summary>A Pilot Study Evaluating Minimized Time Beam Hypofractionated IMRT PET Assisted Target Definition Patients High Grade Gliomas The aim pilot project explore feasibility combine simple conformal plan ( Phase I ) IMRT treatment approach ( Phase II ) high grade glioma patient aim start RT soon possible follow patient 's first outpatient visit ( thus , minimize 'time beam ' ) . It hop rapid treatment start initial 3D CRT plan lessen clinical deterioration due growth aggressive tumour . The use Linac-based IMRT Phase II patient 's treatment plan maintain benefit sophistication IMRT . Using novel PET imaging also hope good characterize region glioma cell thus produce optimize plan target volume ( PTVs ) patient decrease volume normal brain irradiated aim minimize radiation toxicity .

	<detailed_description>A Pilot Study Evaluating Minimized Time Beam Hypofractionated IMRT PET Assisted Target Definition Patients High Grade Gliomas BACKGROUND INFORMATION Standard Treatment High grade glioma ( HGG ) comprise vast majority primary brain tumor . With conventional treatment , tumor recurrence subsequent patient death expect small minority patient . Conventional treatment consist maximal surgical debulking follow radiation therapy ( RT ) temozolomide ( TMZ ) chemotherapy . Typically radiation therapy give 2 Gy fraction total dose 60 Gy plan target volume ( PTV ) . What Optimal PTV ? Currently know target volume constitute optimal PTV individual patient HGG . With conventional MRI-based target definition , common practice draw gross tumour volume ( GTV ) include contrast enhance lesion see T1C image . An additional uniform margin approximately 1.5 cm add address clinically occult glioma cell create clinical target volume ( CTV ) , plus additional 0.5 cm create final PTV . This practice base pattern recurrence study . In study , 80-90 % HGGs tend recur within 2 cm original T1C enhance lesion . The addition uniform 2 cm margin initial GTV dramatically increase volume apparently normal brain irradiated , volume brain irradiated principal determinant subsequent radiation toxicity . By use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image good characterize region harbour glioma cell , hope able minimize size uniform margin apply GTV , thus produce optimized PTV patient . PET Imaging For pilot study use novel PET agent include F19AZA C11 Methionine assist construction patient optimize PTV . The volume construct base MRI reflect underlie anatomy structure tumor . On hand volume construct base PET image reflect underlying physiology thus refer biological target volume ( BTV ) distinguish MRI base GTV . The clinician use complementary information provide GTV BTV construct composite CTV , grown uniform 0.5 cm margin PTV . The PET image carry separate research protocol submit nuclear medicine , patient need sign inform consent agent use . At investigator discretion , patient give choice undergo image use full complement PET agent select subset agent . IMRT 3D conformal RT ( 3D CRT ) standard treatment technique use treat HGGs many centre . With advancement IMRT technique , clinician able deliver sophisticated RT plan . With sophisticated approach clinician able limit volume apparently uninvolved brain encompass high dose treatment volume . In recent protocol gain experience use helical tomotherapy-base IMRT . In current protocol , plan use Linac-based IMRT . One advantage Linac-based IMRT helical tomotherapy plan may include non-coplanar beam . This additional degree freedom expect result well plan conformation . Also , Linac-based IMRT plan add conformal plan phase I thereby adjust accordingly . Overcoming Radio-Resistant Tumor Clonogens In protocol plan use hypofractionated RT ( 60 Gy 20 fraction 4 week ) . Hypofractionation advantage shorten overall treatment time ( minimizes opportunity tumor repopulation treatment course ) . The large dose per fraction also expect biologically effective radio-resistant tumor clonogens . An identical fractionation scheme report safe recent study patient HGG ( IJROBP 58 1 247-252 2004 Sultanem ) similar fraction scheme use recent glioma protocol 60 Gy 22 fraction 4.5 week ) . As yet , observe obvious increased toxicity patient ( Personal Observation ) . Minimizing Time Beam HGGs locally aggressive rapidly grow tumor . The typical presenting symptom usually related mass effect tumor adjacent distant nerve cell . Once intracranial pressure ( ICP ) begin rise , subsequent growth tumor within confined space skull result dramatic increase ICP subsequent neuron damage ( usually permanent ) . Hence imperative initiation therapy delay . Unfortunately design sophisticated IMRT plan base advance image technology complex potentially time consume process . When treatment delay consequence process , patient frequent deteriorates clinically possibly result permanent decline quality life , decision discontinue RT even death . In protocol plan explore feasibility combine approach use 3D CRT IMRT . The first half treatment ( 2 week ) give use simple 3D CRT approach base patient 's preoperative MRI image . This advantage facilitate rapid start RT hopefully arrest evolve clinical deterioration may occur ( minimize time beam ) . The goal start RT soon possible first OPD visit . The planning , evaluation QA IMRT plan progress patient undergoing phase I treatment . OBJECTIVES Primary End Point : 1 . Time initial OPD visit start RT compare historical control receive helical tomotherapy base IMRT ( Time Beam ) Secondary End Points : 1 . Overall Survival 2 . Disease-free survival 3 . Patterns recurrence 4 . Toxicity 5 . Quality life 6 . Number patient complete treatment STUDY DESIGN Schema Radiation Therapy Phase I 30 Gy 10 fraction PTV1 Using 3D CRT GTV1 = Intra peri-tumoural edema see preoperative MRI CTV1 = GTV1 + 1.5 cm margin PTV1 = CTV1 + 0.5 cm margin Note : The 1.5 cm margin add create CTV1 may reduce discretion clinician area anatomical barrier glioma spread ( i.e . skull , tentorium , etc . ) Phase II 30 Gy 10 fraction &gt; 90 % PTV2 GTV2 = Contrast enhance lesion BTV = Extent tumor see PET image CTV2 = ( Union GTV2 BTV ) + &gt; 0.5 cm margin PTV2 = CTV2 + 0.5 cm margin Note : The margin add CTV2 may enlarge discretion clinician maximum 1.5 cm . The dose receive PTV2 region encroach within 3 mm , overlap , dose limit critical structure restrict dose constraint allow particular critical structure . Exceptions may make clinician 's discretion dose limit critical structure grossly involved tumor . Chemotherapy Patients also offer standard TMZ chemotherapy , patient refuse TMZ unable tolerate/receive , may still enroll study . PET Imaging Studies do baseline post RT ( 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month ) . INCLUSION CRITERIA Histopathologically-confirmed grade III grade IV supratentorial glioma Age &gt; 18 KPS &gt; 70 No prior radiation therapy brain No active prior malignancy Signed study-specific consent form EXCLUSION CRITERIA No histopathologically-confirmation grade III grade IV supratentorial glioma Age &lt; 18 KPS &lt; 70 Prior radiation therapy brain Active prior malignancy RECRUITMENT Number patient 25 ( High Grade Glioma ) STATISTICAL ANALYSIS This pilot study comprise total 25 high grade glioma patient . STOPPING RULES Both acute late toxicity interest study well disease-free survival , pattern recurrence quality life assessment . Patients closely follow treat Radiation Oncologist / Research Nurse sever adverse event report Principal Investigator Research Ethics Board per set REB guideline . DATA SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE Any serious adverse event occur time consented patient begin study treatment 30 day end study treatment must report participate institution 's Research Ethics Board within REB set report guideline . Any SAE occur one month post study treatment timeframe felt related study treatment must report participate institution 's Research Ethics Board within REB set report guideline . If death relate study treatment , REB receive notification within 24 hour event , full report follow . All death occur study within 30 day last study treatment , regardless relationship treatment , need report REB . A research nurse / radiation oncologist responsible regular monitoring patient study treatment . If number event meet stop criterion list point 12.0 , accrual halt Principal Investigator inform Research Ethics Board timely manner .</detailed_description>
