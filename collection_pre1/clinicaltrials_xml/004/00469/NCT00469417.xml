	<brief_title>Metvix PDT Versus Cryotherapy Patients With Primary Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BCC highly frequent skin malignancy , account approximately 75 % non-melanoma skin cancer . It common malignant tumour organ , mostly affect head neck ( 84 % ) fair-skinned people . Several non-pharmacological treatment modality use BCC , include excision surgery , Moh 's surgery , radiation , curettage/electrodesiccation cryotherapy . The treatment use depend type , size , depth localisation BCC lesion . The use PDT attractive treatment BCCs efficiency , mild local side effect excellent cosmetic outcome . Previous clinical experience promising patient primary BCCs include prospective , randomise , comparative , multicenter study show Metvix non-inferior alternative treatment well cosmetic outcome . The primary end-point number patient 75 % BCC lesion respond completely 3 month PDT Metvix 3 month cryotherapy . Both on-site independent , blind response assessment analyse . The analysis base result independent review board constitute primary analysis . The secondary end-points proportion patient less 75 % BCC lesion respond completely , number lesion across patient show complete response , evaluation cosmetic outcome adverse event 3 month Metvix PDT 3 month cryotherapy . In addition 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month recurrence rate assess .</detailed_description>
