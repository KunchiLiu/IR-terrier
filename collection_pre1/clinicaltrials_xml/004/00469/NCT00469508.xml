	<brief_summary>Modafinil non-amphetamine type stimulant act wakefulness-promoting drug , approve managing symptom narcolepsy ( i.e. , daytime somnolence ) . Its precise mechanism action promote wakefulness remain unclear . This trial placebo-controlled double-blind trial modafinil , platform contingency management ( CM ) individual cognitive-behavioral ( CBT ) counseling , treatment methamphetamine dependence . Participants study complete 2-week baseline screen period provide urine sample complete physical psychological assessment establish eligibility study . In addition , participant ask provide blood saliva specimen genetic test order identify genetic variation influence response methamphetamine treatment modafinil . Upon successful completion screening , participant randomly assign receive either modafinil ( 400mg qd ) placebo 12 week study . Neither participant study staff know receive active medication placebo . Regardless medication condition , participant receive CM weekly individual CBT counseling session help stop use methamphetamine prevent relapse . They attend clinical research site ( either UCLA Hollywood Clinic , Rancho Cucamonga site ) three time per week , provide urine sample visit , complete data measure , receive individual CBT counsel one visit week . At end 12-week study , medication placebo discontinue . Participants return research site approximately 30 day follow medication discontinuation brief health check ass possible lingering side effect complete brief data measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This application propose placebo-controlled double-blind trial modafinil , platform contingency management ( CM ) individual cognitive-behavioral counseling ( CBT weekly individual session ) , treatment methamphetamine dependence . Modafinil medication warrant evaluation treatment MA dependence . It half-life approximately 15 hour reach steady state 2-4 day ( Package insert ) likely require daily dosing , reduce problem medication adherence . Modafinil potent psychiatric behavioral effect include brighten mood ( Menza et al. , 2000 ; Ninan et al. , 2004 ) , improve cognition ( Turner et al. , 2004a , b ; 2003 ) , improve impulse control ( Turner et al. , 2003 ; Turner et al. , 2004a ) , counter fatigue ( Beusterien et al. , 1999 , Stahl et al. , 2003 ) . These effect neatly counterbalance effect produce MA withdrawal ( Newton et al. , 2004 ) may particular value ameliorate negative reinforcing property MA , i.e. , MA use immediately relieve depress mood due recent abstinence ( Peck et al. , 2005b ) . CM behavioral intervention effectively help substance abuser initiate abstinence , particularly cocaine ( Higgins et al. , 1993 ; Higgins et al. , 2000 ; Higgins et al. , 1991 ) methamphetamine ( Roll &amp; Shoptaw , press ; Shoptaw et al. , 2005 ) . As well , CM show reduce substance abuse optimize effect medication reduce substance abuse ( Carroll , 2004 ; Shoptaw et al. , 2002 ) . The objective study determine whether modafinil reduces methamphetamine use concomitant physical psychological symptom effectively placebo administer conjunction CM CBT . The purpose project evaluate whether methamphetamine abuser seek outpatient treatment demonstrate significantly significant reduction methamphetamine randomly assign receive modafinil ( 400mg qd ) combination CM weekly CBT compare peer randomly assign receive placebo combination CM weekly CBT . Research Hypotheses : 1 . Participants receive active experimental drug ( modafinil 400mg ) demonstrate statistically significant reduction methamphetamine use participant receive placebo . Methamphetamine use outcome measure use urine sample analyze follow index : Treatment Effectiveness Score , Joint Probability Index , self-report methamphetamine use verify urine drug screening , long uninterrupted period methamphetamine abstinence . Primary analysis conduct use model approach ( Generalized Estimation Equations , Markov Chain Transition Models ) depend upon structure dataset . Self-report methamphetamine use analyze use Addiction Severity Index drug composite scale Substance Use Inventory ( SUI ) . 2 . Participants receive active experimental drug remain treatment significantly longer period compare participant receive placebo . Retention measure number day protocol analyzed use survival analysis . . Specifically , participant mild cognitive dysfunction ( measure &lt; =1 SD publish mean MicroCog assessment ) receive modafinil ( 400mg ) demonstrate significantly great overall retention , attendance CBT session participant cognitive function measure great 1 SD mean MicroCog assessment receive placebo . 3 . Participants receive active experimental drug ( modafinil 400mg ) demonstrate statistically significant reduction report methamphetamine craving participant receive placebo . Craving outcomes measure use visual analogue scale . 4 . Participants receive active experimental drug ( modafinil 400mg ) demonstrate statistically significant reduction withdrawal symptom somatic complaint compare participant receive placebo . These outcome measure use BSI , Beck Depression Inventory-II , Quality Well-Being scale . Exploratory analysis also conduct identify potential genetic variant associate treatment response modafinil MA dependence . Candidate gene implicate previous research involve pathogenesis MA dependence and/or molecular mechanism modafinil ( example , gene neurotransmitter receptor transporter , include dopamine , norepinephrine , GABA , glutamate , well gene enzyme involve metabolism neurotransmitter , catechol-O-methyltransferase monoamine oxidase A ) sequence order determine frequency know single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , well potentially identify novel SNPs , gene among MA dependent participant . Initial analysis focus gene involve dopaminergic pathway , give importance dopamine neurobiology MA dependence , additional gene may also assess . SNPs associate response modafinil identify order generate hypotheses future pharmacogenomic study .</detailed_description>
