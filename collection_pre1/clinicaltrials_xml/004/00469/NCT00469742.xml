	<brief_title>Aprotinin Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aprotinin ( Trasylol ; Bayer Corporation , Pittsburgh , PA ) , serine protease inhibitor isolate bovine lung , use intra-operatively cardiac surgery reduce bleeding . It think work inhibit contact activation phase coagulation cascade , reduce thrombin generation , prevent fibrinolysis attenuate cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) -induced platelet dysfunction.Though efficacy aprotinin reduce blood loss adult undergo CPB well establish , safety profile , specifically association renal dysfunction , thrombosis long-term mortality , question . Although homeostatic derangement CPB significant pediatric patient , efficacy safety profile patient population actually less clear . In child undergo re-operative cardiac surgical procedure , aprotinin show effective attenuate post-bypass coagulopathies decrease blood product exposure ( 4 ) . However , little information available neonate undergo CPB receive intra-operative aprotinin especially term renal dysfunction thrombosis . All neonate underwent Cardiopulmonary Bypass surgery ( CPB ) Children 's Healthcare Atlanta March 1 , 2004 March 1 , 2007 candidate retrospective chart review . Notations make regard received aprotinin . Primary end point include post-operative renal dysfunction , need temporary dialysis , thrombosis in-hospital mortality . Post -operative renal dysfunction define double pre-operative creatinine level within first 72 hour surgery . Thrombosis find initial hospitalization consider significant . Chart review gather demographic data ( age , weight type surgery ) well data include CPB time , aortic cross clamp time , presence regional perfusion , low temperature CPB , time chest closure , hour NIRS value 40 first 24 hour post-op , high record lactate value , blood product administer first 24 hour post-op , chest tube drainage first 24 hour post-op , first post-op weight , time extubation time ICU discharge .</detailed_description>
