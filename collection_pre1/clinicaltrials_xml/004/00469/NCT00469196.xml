	<brief_summary>Mesothelioma incurable cancer involve line lung . Patients usually suffer progressive symptom shortness breath chest pain , ultimately succumb disease . While small number patient qualify aggressive treatment surgery , chemotherapy radiation , enjoy long-term survival , vast majority patient incurable disease . The treatment option currently available , include chemotherapy radiation treatment , modestly effective alleviate symptom improve life expectancy . This trial explore use new radiation technology ( tomotherapy ) , treat mesothelioma aggressively possible . Tomotherapy 's ability treat unusual shape tumour , particularly wrap around sensitive normal tissue ( lung ) , enable high dos radiation use may improve effectiveness . We treat 17 patient tomotherapy assess breathing , symptom , quality life patient treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Malignant mesothelioma pleura one challenging diseases treat oncology . It often associate previous exposure asbestos many year past mean latency period asbestos exposure development mesothelioma approximately 48 year . The disease commonly present fifth seventh decade life , natural history one relentless progression eventual death nearly patient . It metastasize regional node and/or distant site , morbidity mortality come local disease chest , cause progressive constriction , death pulmonary insufficiency infection . Common clinical manifestation include pleural effusion , superior vena cava obstruction , dysphagia , laryngeal nerve palsy . Median survival rate generally less one year time diagnosis , although may small subset patient indolent disease longer survival duration . Patients generally suffer significant symptom course illness , particularly progressive dyspnea chest pain . Treatment option mesothelioma The treatment mesothelioma characterize disappointment . The form `` curative '' treatment attempt combination surgery ( extrapleural pneumonectomy ) , chemotherapy , radiation treatment hemithorax . This described Sugerbaker , report 5-year survival rate 22 % 120 patient treat . Unfortunately , approach possible early stage disease ( clinical stage I nodal involvement ) absence comorbid medical illness , vast majority patient present disease advance consider approach . Role radiotherapy malignant mesothelioma : Radiation therapy use radical palliative intent . Radical treatment tumoricidal dose difficult achieve conventional treatment machine due dose limitation normal tissue . The liver , heart , stomach , normal lung tissue routinely encompass within plan target volume tissue tolerance dos necessary control disease . Curative ( adjuvant ) treatment also give extrapleural pneumonectomy , problem underlie lung deal , nearby normal structure still difficult avoid . A main component problem curative adjuvant radiotherapy presence chest wall diaphragm motion radiotherapy . Breathing motion affect chest wall diaphragm primarily , two principal target mesothelioma . Maneuvers breath hold respiratory gating , show limited success lung cancer radiotherapy , difficult mesothelioma due presence significant dyspnea pain majority patient . Clearly attempt treat thoracic pleura high-dose radiotherapy must either limit least account organ motion . The published result treat mesothelioma primary radiotherapy suboptimal . High dose treatment hemithorax use conventional linear accelerator typically result complete loss function underlie lung , survival benefit palliative radiotherapy treatment . However , study suggest specific symptom effectively palliate focused radiation treatment . Gordon et al review 29 course palliative radiotherapy 19 patient , vary dose/fractionation schedule . Overall 11/29 treatment course result complete , `` substantial '' , partial relief symptom . Furthermore , palliation symptom strongly correlate dos 40 Gy , suggest dose-response relationship . Other investigator show effective palliation lower dos . Davis et al treated patient 20-30 Gy 4-10 fraction , response rate 60-68 % . De Graaf-Strukowska show 50 % pain response rate patient treat mean dose 36 Gy minimum 4 Gy per fraction . These study suggest although radiation effective treatment modality mesothelioma , technical difficulty treat pleural space effectively limit risk-benefit ratio . Helical tomotherapy technique treat mesothelioma Tomotherapy relatively new technology delivers intensity modulate radiation helical fashion , much like spiral CT scan . Because treatment give angle around patient , result dose distribution highly conformal effectively reduce nearby normal tissue . Mesothelioma identify early tomotherapy 's development ideal site technology , since target volume extremely difficult treat use conventional technique well suit tangential beam tomotherapy . A test plan use tomotherapy `` treat '' sample patient result excellent dose coverage pleural disease acceptable dose deliver ipsilateral contralateral lung [ unpublished data ] . Nevertheless , test plan design static system absence respiratory motion , feasibility treatment breathe patient remain unproven . Tomotherapy currently routine clinical research use several centre across North America , include Cross Cancer Institute commission 2003 . Study Objectives Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint disease-specific symptom control rate post-treatment , base Palliation Index [ Gordon 1982 ] . Secondary Endpoints Overall survival Radiographic response rate 3 month post-treatment Quality life score ( QLQ-L30 ) 1- , 3- 6-months post-treatment Acute subacute toxicity treatment Feasibility use cine-MR , use 3T-MRI , define target volume mesothelioma Performance status 1- , 3- 6-months post-treatment Pulmonary function test result 1- , 3- 6-months post-treatment Study Design Description study This single institution single-arm phase II study , assess efficacy tomotherapy-delivered radiation patient symptomatic mesothelioma . Patients treated radiation alone ( concurrent chemotherapy ) , assess symptom performance status post-therapy . Duration study Based statistical analysis ( see ) , require 14 analyzable patient . With potential drop-out rate 20 % , accrue 17 patient total . Assuming possible accrual rate one patient every 1-2 month , may take 24-34 month complete accrual process . Selection Patients Eligibility Criteria Histologic diagnosis pleural mesothelioma Age &gt; 18 Life expectancy &gt; 4 month Able breathe comfortably supine position period approximately 20 minute ( without supplemental O2 ) Has deny treatment pemetrexed chemotherapy , evidence progressive refractory disease treatment pemetrexed . Not eligible decline aggressive multimodality ( surgical ) management early-stage disease Signed informed consent CT scan chest perform within 6 week study entry Ineligibility Criteria Any contraindication thoracic radiotherapy In judgment treat physician , inadequate pulmonary reserve tolerate propose radiotherapy . Unable perform shallow breathe manner make tomotherapy delivery possible Presence symptomatic distant metastatic disease Pre-treatment image Pre-simulation imaging require part study order quantify extent chest wall diaphragm movement breathe cycle . Two approach analysis acceptable : MR imaging ( use 3T MRI CBIAR facility ) CT/fluoroscopy ( use equipment radiation oncology department ) . The decision technique use depend status MRI equipment breathe assessment time patient accrual . Patient follow-up evaluation Baseline 1- month 3-months 6-months History/physical PFTs PS Palliation index QOL CT chest Planning MR image Statistical consideration The number patient require base estimate efficacy propose treatment regimen desire level statistical significance . The table indicate relationship factor number patient require : Response rate Required `` n '' P-value 0.05 59 0.048 0.10 29 0.047 0.15 19 0.046 0.20 14 0.044 0.25 11 0.042 0.30 9 0.040 Based estimate response rate propose treatment ( ability achieve relief symptom ) , `` n '' patient treat least one patient demonstrate measurable response 95 % time . In study , efficacy 20 % choose worst-case scenario , treatment would likely offer palliation . Therefore , 14 evaluable patient require refute null hypothesis treatment ineffective . If true efficacy rate high , likelihood false negative result lower , estimate true response rate learn .</detailed_description>
