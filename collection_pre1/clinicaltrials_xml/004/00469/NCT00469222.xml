	<brief_summary>Current treatment limited stage small cell lung cancer poor cure rate . The addition chest radiation chemotherapy improve cure rate , cancer still come back chest 30-50 % time . Two factor improve control cure rate cancer increase chest radiation dose minimize overall time take complete radiation treatment . One method achieve goal give radiation day . This study mean study tolerable effective would increase intensity chest radiation small cell lung cancer patient increase daily radiation dose . We aim find high dose chest radiotherapy safely give chemotherapy use strategy . Patients trial monitor , radiation chemotherapy treatment treatment side-effects , effective treatment control cancer quality life change . Results trial help define effective radiotherapy dose tolerable type lung cancer quality life change patient experience undergo treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Local control overall survival rate associated standard chemotherapy radiotherapy give limited stage small cell lung cancer poor emerge evidence several study suggest intensify radiotherapy dose give may improve patient outcome , cost increase radiotherapy side effect . This proposal aim study novel method intensify chest radiotherapy dose via increase daily radiotherapy dose direct region visible disease . This strategy allow delivery increase radiation dos without prolong overall treatment time allow potential regrowth cancer cell . We aim determine maximum radiation dose safely give chemotherapy limited stage small cell lung cancer study effect type radiation regimen chemotherapy patient side effect quality life . Results trial contribute development ideal radiotherapy regimen limit stage small cell lung cancer . Our result add literature study effect dose-intense radiation strategy lung cancer patient quality life .</detailed_description>
