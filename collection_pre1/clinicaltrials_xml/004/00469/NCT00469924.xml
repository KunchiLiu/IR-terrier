	<brief_summary>Patients hospital may develop serious problem detect blood test . It important physician notify abnormal blood test soon possible . Currently , do use phone call lab nurse . The nurse page doctor wait call back . We conduct study use automate page system immediately alert physician directly . We test whether automated system affect time physician respond abnormality . If physician 's patient serious laboratory result , automatically send laboratory result physician 's PDA . We also provide guideline treat patient . These guideline come exist hospital policy available , local expert opinion . We determine whether patient get good faster care automate alert system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Automated Paging System Response Critical Laboratory Values</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We evaluate effect real time clinical alert time response quality response critical laboratory value . We define time response time acceptance laboratory value laboratory information system time physician 's order write response laboratory value . In absence time physician order , use time administration treatment estimate time response . We define quality response whether treatment consistent exist hospital policy expert guideline . This prospective interrupted time series study . The set secondary-tertiary care inpatient general medicine unit academic teach hospital ( Sunnybrook UHN ) . The physician participant staff physicians medical resident Division General Internal Medicine . The patient participant general internal medicine inpatient critical laboratory value . The intervention automate real time clinical alert system include evidence base decision support patient specific information critical laboratory abnormality . There two primary outcome measure : ( 1 ) time response , define time critical laboratory abnormality time resolution critical laboratory abnormality , ( 2 ) quality response , define whether response concordant exist evidence base protocol care . Secondary outcome measure : length stay , mortality , time resolution abnormality , frequency recurrence abnormality . Other process measure : quality response , time resolution , proportion resolve within 24 hour . Time response define time identification critical value laboratory time physician order response abnormality . There two primary outcome measure : ( 1 ) time response , define time critical laboratory abnormality time physian order response critical laboratory abnormality , ( 2 ) quality response , define whether response concordant exist evidence base protocol care . Secondary outcome measure : length stay , mortality , time resolution frequency recurrence . Time resolution time initial laboratory abnormality time abnormality resolve . Frequency recurrence proportion patient develop second episode critical abnormality resolution .</detailed_description>
