	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized internal radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well internal radiation therapy work treat patient primary liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internal Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine tumor response selective internal radiation therapy comprise yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres ( Sir-Spheres® ) patient unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine health-related quality life patient receive regimen . - Determine survival patient receive regimen . OUTLINE : Patients undergo selective internal radiation therapy comprise yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres ( Sir-Spheres® ) via catheter directly hepatic artery day 1 . Health-related quality life assess prior initial treatment periodically thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 12-24 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
