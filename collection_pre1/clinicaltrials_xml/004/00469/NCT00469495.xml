	<detailed_description>Leishmaniases group diseases cause parasite transmitted sand fly . There number disease associated infection range simple skin lesion severe , fatal form . The standard treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) 20 day course antimony , although fairly effective , multiple side effect difficult administer . The population affect leishmaniasis usually also affected intestinal helminth ( worm ) . It unknown effect two disease immune system . As pathology CL mediate inflammatory reaction helminth regulate inflammation , helminthic infection may beneficial leishmaniasis . However , recent study research group suggest subject infect leishmania helminth longer heal time less likely respond antimony . Since failure initial therapy often result repeat course drug development severe disease , propose study investigate role early treatment co-existing helminth infection improve response rate antimony subject CL .</detailed_description>
