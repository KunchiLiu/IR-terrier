	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand whether gene certain factor environment determine eye respond Lucentis ( ranibizumab ) treatment . For example , whether variant within specific gene mean patient likely get well vision treatment another patient different gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Genetic Environmental Factors Their Effect Response Treatment With Lucentis ( Ranibizumab ) Wet AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness develop world . The advanced stage disease characterize development geographic atrophy choroidal neovascularization , result significant loss vision . Development intravitreal anti-VEGF agent ranibizumab significantly improve outcomes neovascular disease . However , possible predict individual respond treatment . The objective study establish association genetic factor treatment response intravitreal Lucentis . This accomplish SNP-genotyping participant AMD-susceptibility candidate angiogenesis-pathway gene , collect environmental risk factor variable evaluate clinical outcome . The aim pharmacogenetics study identify patient outset treatment require intensive therapy .</detailed_description>
