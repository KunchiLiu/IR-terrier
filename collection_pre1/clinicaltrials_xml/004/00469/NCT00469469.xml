	<brief_summary>This Phase II study intravenous Bevacizumab patient pathologically confirm nonresectable primary adrenocortical cancer ( ACC ) . Patients must receive prior therapy . They receive Bevacizumab single agent every 2 week intravenously disease progression . This study open multiple site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Study Using Bevacizumab Patients With Adrenocortical Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) rare malignancy incidence 1.5 2 per million per year United state . Surgery therapeutic option prolong survival . Currently therapies prove prolong survival patient nonsurgically resectable disease . ACC show highly resistant standard chemotherapy , therefore , important test agent mechanisms action . This single arm phase II study Bevacizumab , angiogenesis inhibitor , give single agent 10 mg/kg IV every 2 week patient unresectable ACC . Bevicizumab use first line therapy . The study test Bevacizumab able prolong time progression . If delay time progression 4 month great see , consider clinically meaningful study consider . This study conduct multiple institution ( see ) .</detailed_description>
