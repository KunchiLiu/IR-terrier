	<detailed_description>Rationale : The global prevalence diabetes , along devastate effect life expectancy quality life , continue increase . Worldwide , total number people diabetes project rise 171 million 2000 336 million year 2030 . Type 2 diabetes account 85 percent 95 percent diagnose case diabetes associate number serious long-term complication , major cause morbidity , hospitalization mortality diabetic patient . More evidence become available lifestyle clinical intervention pre-diabetic condition effective slow progression pre-diabetes overt diabetes . Over many century , several form traditional medicine develop often base fundamental principle differ `` Western '' medicine . One prominent characteristic Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) , holistic approach function disfunctioning live organism . Every healthy organism Yin Yang balance consider complex interplay body mind . Western medicine relies detail classification disease , empirical investigation treatment target disorder . However , `` Western medicine '' show increased interest traditional form medicine . The progress research , especially metabolomics , ultimate phenotyping , show enable efficacy study complex mixtures Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) complex biological system , bridge molecular pharmacology . The present study especially design explore biomarkers tool early diagnosis diabetes mellitus type 2 objective Western marker TCM . Objectives : The primary objective present study determine consistency classification DM type 2 three category define Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) pre-diabetic subject . Secondary objective find relationships diagnosis accord TCM risk profile accord Western approach ( fast glucose HbA1c plasma , age , BMI , waist circumference ) . Another objective find relationship classification risk DM type 2 accord TCM objective parameter . Study design : This study design explorative study . Study population : In study 50 pre-diabetic male volunteer , fast blood glucose ≥ 6.1 ≤ 6.9 mmol/L , 30-70 year old , BMI ≥ 26 ≤ 35 kg/m2 participate . Intervention : No administration study substance take place . Main study parameters/endpoints : TCM Diagnosis : Identification DM type 2 base TCM , diagnose independently 3 physician classify Upper Xiao , Middle Xiao Lower Xiao . General measurement BMI , waist circumference , blood pressure heart rate variability conduct . Next measurement also follow parameter establish . Biophoton emission : record energy field balance base analysis intensity quantum stochastic nature light hand ( ventral dorsum ) , combination right-left dorsal-ventral symmetry hand . Performance Meridian Measurements ( MERID measurement ) : The 'MERID ' meridian method base change skin impedance give IR ( infrared ) stimulus Biological Active Point ( BAP ) give reliable reproducible measure energy status particular meridian consequently relate organ organ system . Heart rate variability : Heart rate affect sympathetic parasympathetic input . These two branch autonomic control system affect heart rate change heart rate . Cardiac autonomic balance , also call sympatho-vagal balance , combine effect parasympathetic ( inhibitory ) sympathetic ( excitatory ) innervation heart consider main determinant regulation heart rate quantify mean electrocardiography ( ECG ) measurements spectral analysis . Metabolomics : Metabolomics apply study consist number method base LC-MS GC-MS technology determine ( relative ) concentration endogenous metabolite biological sample ( blood urine ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : This study set study explorative character . No administration substance take place . All subject subject seven non-invasive measurement , fill number questionnaire subject three physical examination . Blood sampling , fast state , do two determined time point ( pre-study study ) exceed 30 mL . Furthermore , one ( spot ) urine sample collect study . Based mentioned assessment fact administration substance take place , discomfort subject study minimal risk participate subject negligible .</detailed_description>
