	<brief_summary>There considerable debate last 30 year interaction asthma parasitic infection . It suggest least part reason increase prevalence asthma develop world decrease parasite infection result improved living condition economic development . Our previous study Ethiopia suggest hookworm infection may particularly important process . To establish definitively whether parasite protect allergic disease , specifically asthma , ultimately require randomised clinical trial parasite infection patient asthma . We , researcher University Nottingham , complete study normal volunteer establish dose hookworm necessary generate infection level show protective population survey , show infection well tolerate . In addition , recently complete randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial hookworm infection allergic patient rhinitis show negative effect bronchial responsiveness phase lifecycle hookworm larva migrate lung . Consequently , proceed definitive randomize placebo-controlled trial hookworm infection people asthma . This study also provide u opportunity investigate cellular mechanism effect hookworm infection immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Placebo Controlled Study Effects Therapeutic Hookworm Infection Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological evidence suggest human hookworm infection associate reduce risk asthma allergic disease . This association potentially important understand aetiology asthma allergic disease , also suggest hookworm product might therapeutically effective condition . To test hypothesis hookworm protect asthma ultimately require clinical trial . We carry dose-ranging study establish dose hookworm larva necessary generate infection intensity show protective epidemiological study , acceptable side effect . We also complete randomize controlled clinical trial hookworm infection people allergic rhinoconjunctivitis show significant change airway responsiveness lung migration phase hookworm life cycle . We perform definitive study randomize placebo-controlled trial effect therapeutic hookworm infection people asthma . During study , monitor various indicator asthma control also able measure range relevant immunological parameter explore relation parameter expression allergic asthmatic phenotype</detailed_description>
