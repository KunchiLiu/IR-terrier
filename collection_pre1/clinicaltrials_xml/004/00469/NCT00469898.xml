	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : The general result combine irinotecan platin-based chemotherapy encourage . As toxicity profile associate carboplatin preferable cisplatin expectation patient physician would prefer use combination equally efficacious . To date agreement regard optimal combination agent . Based trial describe protocol experience carboplatin/irinotecan treatment non-small cell lung cancer present trial utilize 21-day cycle irinotecan 50 mg/m2 give day 1 8 carboplatin AUC 5 ( base Calvert formula ) day 1 . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give irinotecan together carboplatin work first-line therapy treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Carboplatin First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To examine anti-tumor efficacy combination Irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) Carboplatin first-line therapy assess response rate patient chemo-naïve extensive stage small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Determine safety , tolerability , feasibility regimen patient . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive irinotecan IV 30-90 minute day 1 8 carboplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 54 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
