Any finding Screening MRI brain MS , except benign finding ( opinion central MRI reading site local site investigator ) require evaluation treatment impact patient 's neurological health ( e.g . small arachnoid cyst , venous angioma ) . Uncontrolled active bacterial , viral , fungal infection . Any previous serious infection discuss GSK medical monitor ( e.g . opportunistic atypical infection ) . History tuberculosis ( TB ) positive chest Xray TB Screening ( prior chest Xray acceptable perform within previous 6 month ) . Known congenital acquire immunodeficiency .
