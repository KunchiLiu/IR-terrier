	<brief_summary>This study compare two treatment approach currently use child cerebral palsy . Both treatment aim improve child 's function . The two approach compare : 1 ) improve function work child improve his/her skill ability ( `` child-focused '' approach ) 2 ) improve function changing/adapting task and/or environment around child improve his/her skill ability ( `` context-focused '' approach ) . It hypothesize context-focused approach significantly improve activity participation outcomes lead significant decrease body function structure outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children cerebral palsy commonly receive ongoing physical occupational therapy facilitate development enhance functional independence movement , self-care , play , school activity leisure . The primary objective project conduct multi-site clinical trial evaluate efficacy context-focused approach improve performance functional task , mobility , participation everyday activity quality life 220 child 12 month 5 year age cerebral palsy . A randomized clinical trial research design use examine efficacy context-focused approach compare child-focused approach . 72 therapist Ontario Alberta randomly assign provide either context-focused child-focused therapy . Therapists group participate training workshop expert consultant available support therapist throughout study . Children receive either context-focused child-focused therapy intervention period 6 month . Outcomes evaluate baseline , 6 month treatment 3-month follow-up period . Outcomes measured across domain International Classification Functioning , Disability Health , include body function structure ( range motion , spinal alignment ) , activity ( performance functional task , motor function ) , participation ( involvement formal informal activity ) , environment ( parent perception care , parental empowerment ) . The child 's range motion also evaluate independent , trained evaluator baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 month . We hypothesize context-focused approach significantly improve activity participation outcomes lead significant decrease body function structure outcome .</detailed_description>
