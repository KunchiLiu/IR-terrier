	<brief_title>Improving Care Primary Care Patients With Diabetes Poor Literacy Numeracy Skills</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results National Adult Literacy Survey ( NALS ) suggest 90 million adult Americans poor quantitative skill . Numeracy , ability understand use number math skill daily life , may particularly important patient diabetes care diabetes often require self-management skill rely daily application math skill , count carbohydrate , interpret blood glucose monitoring , apply slide scale insulin regimen , calculate insulin carbohydrate ratio . Presumably diabetes patient poor numeracy difficulty self-management risk poorer clinical outcome , date , publish study rigorously examine role numeracy diabetes . We recently complete initial development new scale measure numeracy patient diabetes : Diabetes Numeracy Test ( DNT ) . The aim research perform small randomize control trial ( RCT ) new diabetes educational intervention teach self-management skill compensate poor literacy numeracy skill among sample patient type 2 diabetes low numeracy literacy skill . We hypothesize group patient poor literacy and/or numeracy teach self-management skill accommodate poor numeracy : ( 1 ) improve treatment satisfaction perceive self-efficacy , ( 2 ) improve performance self-management task , ( 3 ) improve glycemic control compare control group receive usual education care .</detailed_description>
