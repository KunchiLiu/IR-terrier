	<brief_title>Vanderbilt Pertussis Exposure Study : PEP Vaccinated Healthcare Workers Following Pertussis Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pertussis , cause bacterium Bordetella pertussis , acute respiratory tract infection transmit susceptible person aerosolize respiratory droplet direct contact respiratory secretion . Classic pertussis disease characterize three phase illness : catarrhal phase person note cough coryza ; paroxysmal phase person develop spasmodic cough post-tussive vomit inspiratory whoop ; convalescent phase , symptom slowly resolve . The risk transmission organism compound nondescript nature symptom early course illness , particularly adult . Classically recognize disease infant child ( `` whooping cough '' ) , incidence pertussis infection adolescent adult increase recent year . Persons &gt; 15 year age make twenty percent report case . This increase likely due several factor , include wan protection childhood vaccination natural infection , increase appreciation disease adolescent adult , improve ability clinician diagnose pertussis recognition use serologic method . Healthcare worker ( HCWs ) increase risk acquire pertussis infection due regular contact infect patient wan protection childhood vaccination natural pertussis infection . Healthcare-associated outbreaks pertussis also increasingly recognize report diverse range healthcare facility . Such outbreak often due under-recognition pertussis subsequent failure isolate suspect case , wan immunity childhood vaccination disease , increase incidence pertussis infection adult adolescent . Infected HCWs serve vector infection susceptible contact include patient , employee , even child . Vaccination effective tool prevention pertussis . In 2005 , two tetanus toxoid , reduce diphtheria toxoid , reduce antigen quantity acellular pertussis vaccine ( Tdap ) license use adolescent adult . In view increasingly recognize problem healthcare-associated transmitted pertussis infection , Centers Disease Control Prevention 's ( CDC ) Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) target HCWs priority group pertussis vaccination 2006 , primarily reduce risk spread pertussis within health care institution . Until licensure Tdap , method reduce transmission pertussis healthcare-associated exposure person pertussis post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) antibiotic employee furlough . Close contact expose pertussis-infected patient staff member routinely treat macrolide therapy ( erythromycin azithromycin ) , expose HCWs develop cough-illness restrict work 5 day antibiotic therapy . PEP believe prevent symptomatic infection expose person administer within 21 day cough onset . Traditionally , decision regard PEP expose HCWs involve detail assessment degree patient contact , risk development severe complicate pertussis , regular evaluation follow-up occurrence symptom . These often time-consuming effort usually responsibility infection control occupational health personnel . With licensure Tdap recommend vaccination HCWs , hop vaccination eliminate need provide antibiotic PEP , particularly recently-vaccinated HCWs . However , confirm randomized clinical trial , , therefore , definitive formal recommendation make regard modification PEP vaccinate HCWs . Two potential strategy exist management vaccinate HCWs follow exposure person pertussis : ) provision universal antibiotic therapy b ) careful daily observation vaccinate HCWs development symptom without antibiotic prescription . A comparison two strategy focus study .</detailed_description>
