	<brief_summary>The main purpose study examine effect tipranavir combine ritonavir , medication treatment HIV-infection , buprenorphine/naloxone ( BUP ) people receive dose buprenorphine/naloxone least 3 week study entry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between Buprenorphine Tipranavir/Ritonavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number people HIV-infection obtain HIV injection drug use . Some people currently treat buprenorphine/naloxone ( BUP ) addiction medication HIV infection . Tipranavir medication recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment HIV-infection . Tipranavir give combination another HIV medication , ritonavir . Tipranavir act make difficult virus cause AIDS multiply cause damage immune system . Ritonavir act increase amount tipranavir available fight HIV . Earlier study look combination BUP HIV medication show BUP HIV medication act differently take together . It important learn take BUP HIV medication together result change blood level either medication . If HIV medication decrease level BUP blood , individual take BUP HIV medication may experience symptom withdrawal ( `` dope sickness '' ) , even take usual dose BUP . On hand , BUP decrease amount HIV medication blood , HIV medication may less effective control HIV infection . It therefore important learn tipranavir/ritonavir BUP affect take together . In order learn effect BUP tipranavir/ritonavir , need measure amount BUP blood 24 hour take tipranavir/ritonavir BUP together compare amount BUP blood take tipranavir/ritonavir .</detailed_description>

WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start Study Day 1 . History current evidence significant acute chronic medical illness , within investigator 's discretion , would interfere conduct interpretation study . History acute chronic pancreatitis . History uncontrolled chronic medical illness could adversely affect subject 's adherence study protocol affect patient safety opinion investigator Use medication think significantly alter metabolism tipranavir , ritonavir , Buprenorphine naloxone . History hemolytic disorder ( include druginduced hemolysis ) . Proven suspect acute hepatitis time study entry . Chronic liver disease ChildsPugh Class B C stag Current recent ( within 3 month ) gastrointestinal disease would interfere conduct interpretation study . Any major surgery within 4 week enrollment . Minor surgical procedure require local anesthesia exception . Any gastrointestinal surgery could impact upon absorption study drug . Donation blood plasma blood bank clinical study ( except screen visit ) within 4 week enrollment . Blood transfusion within 4 week enrollment . Inability tolerate oral medication . Inability tolerate venipuncture and/or absence secure venous access . Inability refrain smoke inresidence period Known suspect HIV infection ( subject find positive upon screen HIV exclude ) . Known active drug alcohol abuse , opinion investigator make study participation completion unlikely . Any sound medical , psychiatric and/or social reason determine Investigator . Evidence organ dysfunction clinically relevant ( determined investigator ) deviation norm observe buprenorphine/naloxone treat population physical examination , vital sign , ECG clinical laboratory determination . Ingestion alcohol within 24 hour prior dose study medication Positive breathalyzer alcohol test , positive urine screen barbiturate , benzodiazepine , amphetamine , THC , cocaine opiates buprenorphine/naloxone . Positive blood screen HIV antibody . Subjects AST , ALT bilirubin &gt; 2.5X upper limit normal . Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL , platelet count &lt; 75 , 000/mm3 . Positive serum urine HCG .
