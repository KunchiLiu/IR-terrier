	<brief_summary>Stroke major cause morbidity western society , infrequent complication cardiac surgery . The majority thromboembolic stroke arise left atrium , particular leave atrial appendage . This study aim assess short-term effect leave atrial appendage ligation term postoperative clinical biochemical parameter ; long-term effect leave atrial appendage ligation term stroke incidence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion Short-Term Clinical Outcomes Long-Term Stroke Incidence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation , leave atrial appendage origin least 90 % leave atrial clot , result systemic embolus cause approximately 25 % stroke . The stroke rate patient atrial fibrillation old 75 year age 8.1 % per year one clinical risk factor 12 % per year age clinical trial population history prior thromboembolism . Three-year stroke rate elderly nursing home patient anticoagulated excess 50 % ( Atrial Fibrillation Investigators 1994 ) . Anticoagulation oftentimes withheld due perception excessive risk case fall ; even anticoagulation prescribed , well know therapeutic level always maintain . Left atrial appendage obliteration commonly perform variety cardiac surgical operation . There animal study theoretical argument demonstrate importance atrial appendage role support cardiac output blood pressure , modulate thirst hypercoagulability ( Stollberger 2003 ) ; however poorly study documented human available literature . BNP ANP show increase proportionately leave atrial appendage dysfunction , von Willebrands Factor , D-Dimer , thrombin-antithrombin III complex ( Igarashi 2001 ) . To date , single randomize controlled trial adequate follow-up assess short- long-term clinical effectiveness concurrent prophylactic LAA ligation . This trial fill void .</detailed_description>
