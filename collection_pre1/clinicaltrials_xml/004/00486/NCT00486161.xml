	<brief_summary>Ghrelin GH-secretagogue gastrointestinal hormone regulate feed behavior interact directly hypothalamic center concert negative permissive neuromodulators . Ghrelin involve control energy balance short-term long-term , level inversely relate degree obesity , insulin-resistance energy accumulation . Consequently , obesity bear decrease ghrelin level increase upon weight loss , energy depletion long-term exercise program . Nevertheless , role acute exercise secretion bioactive component ghrelin yet unknown condition normal excessive body weight . Our study examines acylated total ghrelin secretion follow cycloergometric exercise test obese age- sex-matched lean subject document ghrelin component change function fat accumulation , insulin homeostasis , growth hormone secretion , non-esterified fatty acid availability exercise performance . Our study aim test hypothesis ghrelin component may regulate acute exercise , concentration exercise peak relate acute metabolic homeostasis . Targetting purpose may help clarify ghrelin involvement acute condition unrelated gastrointestinal activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Ghrelin natural ligand hypothalamic GH-secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) -1a ( 1 ) . Over time , document ghrelin predominantly function central modulator energy homeostasis via NP-Y AgRP-containing neuron locate arcuate nucleus hypothalamus ( 2 ) . It thus promote drive eat governs long-term energy accumulation ; clearly , circulate ghrelin concentration related energy balance base following evidence ( 3 ) : - ghrelin level acutely modulate food intake glucose administration - long-term ghrelin homeostasis reflect adiposity , insulin resistance chronic exercise - fast postabsorptive condition , negative correlation exist ghrelin rest energy expenditure independent variation insulin level , energy intake , body composition body weight . In summary , circulate ghrelin level approximately 30 % low normal ; inversely related increase body fat , leptin insulin level ; far less responsive post-meal inhibition control ( 3 ) . 2 . In circulation , ghrelin find acylated desacylated peptide . Ser ( 3 ) -octanoylation prerequisite ghrelin biological activity ( 3 ) . Des-octanoyl ghrelin variant additionally identify ( 4,5 ) find exert novel antiapoptotic effect primary adult culture rat cardiomyocytes ( 6 ) . Using specific immunoassay recognize active ( N-terminus ) total ( N- plus C-terminus ) ghrelin level , assessment circulate ghrelin concentration help discriminate specific function hypothalamic level ( 7 ) , insulin sensitivity ( 8 ) bariatric surgery ( 9 ) . Also , association document obesity total acylated ghrelin concentration , respectively 30 % 56 % low normal ( 10 ) . Our laboratory show previously stratification obese patient ratio measured/predicted rest energy expenditure , allow detect positive relationship acylated ghrelin level efficiency energy expenditure ( 10 ) . Speculatively , could interpret obesity-related compensatory mechanism act contain orexigenic signal afferent brain . 3 . Studies ghrelin responsiveness cycloergometer exercise , treadmill exercise long-distance marathon , originally show variation ghrelin secretion ( 11-13 ) . More recently , significant decrement ghrelin level follow acute exercise bouts observed elite athlete healthy control , well lean individual ( 14 , 15 ) . While finding suggest link ghrelin suppression GH rise one side appetite regulation upon exercise , little know metabolic mechanism regulate ghrelin response acute exercise lean obese state . Based observation , comparative study aim explore response ghrelin component standardize maximal exercise test lean obese state , identify neuroendocrine metabolic predictor ghrelin response group document ghrelin component change function fat accumulation , insulin homeostasis , growth hormone secretion , non-esterified fatty acid availability exercise performance .</detailed_description>
