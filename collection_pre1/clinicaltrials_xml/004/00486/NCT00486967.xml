	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance : Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There increase evidence reciprocal interrelationship chronic heart failure ( CHF ) insulin resistance ( IR ) . Studies show patient CHF IR degree IR associate reduced exercise capacity peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) . IR also link decreased exercise capacity patient diabetes mellitus chronic disease state , well healthy subject confirm IR independently link exercise intolerance study show IR pathophysiologically link CHF implicate disease progression CHF . This likely IR associate endothelial dysfunction , inflammation , increase oxidative stress myocardial remodelling ; process accelerate progression disease CHF . Therefore , IR emerge potential target intervention improve symptom outcome patient CHF . However , still key unanswered question . Firstly , prevalence IR cohort CHF patient Tayside ? Previous study outside UK examine prevalence IR CHF conduct pre-B-blocker era . However , B-blockers , may worsen metabolic control , widely use treatment CHF . It likely prevalence might higher present cohort patient CHF . Secondly , potential contributory factor IR CHF ? The exact mechanism IR CHF know . Sympathetic over-activity CHF acutely reduce insulin sensitivity also decrease release insulin pancreatic beta cell , increase hepatic glucose production . Other mediator include cytokine adiponectin leptin . The loss skeletal muscle bulk impair endothelial function reduce skeletal muscle blood flow may also contribute IR CHF . Determining relative importance various factor may help identify therapeutic strategy overcome IR CHF . Finally , mechanism impair exercise capacity reduce peak VO2 CHF ? Exercise VO2 measure total body 's oxygen consumption reflect cardiac output peripheral utilization oxygen . We know whether problem due worsening reduce cardiac output CHF and/or decrease peripheral utilization . To determine , plan measure cardiac output measurement VO2 . The aims objective study : Primary objective - To establish prevalence Insulin resistance ( IR ) among chronic heart failure ( CHF ) patient Tayside - To identify factor associate IR CHF Secondary Objectives IR could potential functional consequence - Is associate decrease exercise capacity ? - Is associate altered endothelial function ? Investigations : Patients arrive research laboratory fast overnight . Following write informed consent , patient undergo complete medical examination blood ( 40 ml ) drawn measurement neurohormone . Thereafter , follow test do : ( ) . Measurement insulin resistance assess use empirical fasting insulin resistance index ( FIRI ) .For test fasting blood glucose insulin level measure . Fasting insulin resistance index consist product plasma insulin glucose , FIRI= fast glucose X fast insulin / 25 . ( ii ) . Anthropometric measurement ( measurement fat mass fat free mass ) . Body fat measure ( height , weight , skin fold thickness , waist , hip circumference ) . Estimation body fat study skin fold thickness measurement Holtain skin fold caliper18 . Measurement use 3 9 different standard anatomical site around body . The right side usually measure , pinch skin appropriate site raise double layer skin underlie adipose tissue , muscle . The caliper apply 1 cm right angle pinch , read take 2 second later . The mean two measurement take . If two measurement differ greatly , third do , median value take . In study Holtain skin fold calliper use measure triceps skin fold two exactly similar consecutive reading subject . ( iv ) . Endothelial function determine reactive hyperaemia-peripheral arterial tonometry [ RH-PAT ] RH-PAT non-invasive technique assess peripheral microvascular endothelial function measuring change digital pulse volume reactive hyperaemia 21-24 . Bonetti colleagues21 recently report reliable non-invasive tool identify individual coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction digital . The device ( Itamar Medical Ltd. , Caesarea , Israel ) consist two finger-mounted probe , include system inflatable latex air cushion within rigid external case . The probe design allow application constant evenly distribute near-diastolic counter pressure within entire probe , increase sensitivity unload arterial wall tension , prevent venous blood pool avoid venoarteriolar reflex vasoconstriction . Pulsatile volume change fingertip sensed pressure transducer transfer personal computer signal band pass-filtered ( 0.3 30 Hz ) , amplify , display , store . The PAT study perform patient supine position hand level comfortable , thermoneutral environment . A blood pressure cuff place one upper arm ( study arm ) , contralateral arm serf control ( control arm ) ; RH-PAT probe place one finger ( finger II , III , IV ) hand ( finger hand ) . The finger either side one probe separate use soft sponge ring , continuous record pulsatile blood volume response hand initiate . After 10-min equilibration period , blood pressure cuff study arm inflate 60 mm Hg systolic pressure 5 min . The cuff deflate induce reactive hyperaemia , whereas PAT record continue . Ten minute later , patient give single dose nitroglycerin ( NTG ) ( 0.4 mg , sublingual ) ass endothelium-independent PAT response . The reactive hyperaemia-PAT data analyze computer operator-independent manner . As measure extent reactive hyperaemia , reactive hyperaemia-PAT index calculate ratio average amplitude PAT signal 1-min time interval start 1 min cuff deflation divide average amplitude PAT signal 3.5-min time period cuff inflation ( baseline ) ; reactive -PAT index value study arm normalize control arm compensate potential systemic change . Hyperaemic response NTG assess similar manner . At first , average PAT signal amplitude four consecutive 1-min period start 5 min administration sublingual NTG ( 5- 6-min , 6- 7-min , 7- 8-min , 8- 9-min interval ) calculate ; PAT response NTG calculate ratio PAT amplitude 1-min interval peak average PAT signal record divide amplitude PAT signal baseline ( NTG-PAT index ) . ( v ) . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing determine mean incremental cycle ergometry . Expired gas analysis perform continuously throughout test Innocor System ( Innocor , Denmark ) , allow determination VO2 cardiac output . Patients perform grade maximal bicycle exercise test . After 3 minute rest , exercise begin workload 0 Watts increase every 3 minute 25 Watts symptom limit maximum . Expired gas analysis perform continuously throughout test Innocor System ( Innocor , Innovision A/S , Odense , Denmark ) allow determination VO2 cardiac output . Peak oxygen uptake define high value oxygen uptake achieve final 20 second exercise . In addition oxygen uptake [ V02 ] , carbon dioxide production [ VC0 2 ] , respiratory rate [ RR ] , peak rate pressure product [ RPP ] total expiratory volume [ VE ] determine . Anaerobic threshold determine nadir ventilatory equivalent VO2 . Cardiac output determine inert gas rebreathing method ( R ) , use N2o ( blood soluble gas ) SF6 ( blood insoluble gas ) , concentration , enrich o2 , 0.5 % 0.1 % , respectively . Tidal volume progressively increase close circuit match physiologic increase . Use SF6 allow u measure volume lung , valve rebreathing bag . N2o concentration decrease rebreathing maneuver . Three four respiratory cycle need obtain N2o washout . ( vi ) . Neurohormones : Blood drawn plasma noradrenaline , serum leptin , adiponectin plasma cytokine . ( ) The quantitative measurement leptin25-28 serum perform use leptin enzyme immunoassay ELISA kit29 ( DRG Diagnostics , Marburg , Germany ) , accord manufacturer ’ instruction : Briefly , 100µl dilute leptin conjugate dispense well microtiter plate incubate room temperature 1 h. The content well shake well rinse three time diluted wash solution . Into appropriate well dispense 50µl sample ( diluted 1:5 ) standard concentration 0 , 0.8 , 1.6 , 3.1 , 6.2 , 12.5 , 25 ng/ml . Fifty microliters leptin antibody dispense center well achieve complete mixing , plate incubate overnight 4Â°C humidity chamber . The content well shake , well rinse thrice , residual droplet remove . One hundred microliters dilute second antibody dispense well incubate room temperature 1.5 h.
