	<brief_summary>The objective trial determine optimal region lung deposit Prolastin ( alpha-1 antitrypsin ; AAT ) inhalation order treat cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . The AKITA® nebulizer setting vary target inhale drug either deep lung upper airways one one randomization . The study measure much activity enzyme elastase inhibit AAT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deposition Inhaled Prolastin Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimum deposition site ( bronchial peripheral ) CF patient AAT investigate measure several parameter induce sputum . The study start 2 week run-in period plan 60 patient inhale isotonic saline daily . This period follow 4 week treatment period 30 patient inhale AAT peripheral deposition 30 patient inhale AAT bronchial deposition . Six patient group ask collect spontaneous sputum home . Twenty-five milligram AAT deposit one two target site use AKITA® device . The inhalation take place even 18.00 23.00 h. Patients inhale saline daily 2 week ( run-in period ) follow 4 week daily inhalation AAT . Induced sputum collect visit clinic start run-in , start AAT treatment , 2 4 week start AAT treatment .</detailed_description>
