	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Rituximab prednisone may increase number platelet patient immune thrombocytopenic purpura . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give rituximab together prednisone work first-line therapy treat patient immune thrombocytopenic purpura .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Prednisone First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy rituximab , administer standard prednisone treatment , maintain platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm³ 6 month without therapy ( e.g. , splenectomy salvage therapy ) patient immune thrombocytopenic purpura . - Determine safety regimen patient . Secondary - Determine time platelet recovery patient treat regimen . - Determine duration platelet recovery patient treat regimen . - Assess efficacy regimen prevent spontaneous bleed event patient . - Determine response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 oral prednisone daily day 1-14 followed taper day 56 . Treatment administer absence disease relapse unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
