	<brief_summary>This 2-arm study design compare efficacy safety bevacizumab ( Avastin ) combination rituximab ( MabThera ) CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , hydroxydaunorubicin [ doxorubicin ] , Oncovin [ vincristine ] , prednisone ) chemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) versus rituximab plus CHOP chemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) previously untreated patient CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . Patients randomize receive 8 cycle treatment R-CHOP plus bevacizumab R-CHOP plus placebo . Treatment bevacizumab/placebo R-CHOP give either 2-week 3-week schedule bevacizumab give weekly average dose 5 mg/kg ( 10 mg/kg 2-week cycle 15 mg/kg 3-week cycle ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Combination With Rituximab ( MabThera ) CHOP ( Cyclophosphamide , Hydroxydaunorubicin Doxorubicin , Oncovin Vincristine , Prednisone ) Chemotherapy Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) establish review safety data collect study ongoing basis . At meet December 2009 , DSMB note trend increase cardiac toxicity experimental arm ( R-CHOP + bevacizumab ) compare control arm ( R-CHOP + placebo ) . Additional efficacy analyse data 720 randomized patient present DSMB meeting May 22 , 2010 ; indicate improvement efficacy addition bevacizumab R-CHOP . It note , however , apparent increase risk cardiotoxicity , premature treatment withdrawal , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , fatal adverse event ( AEs ) , perforation/ulcer experimental arm . Based assessment increase risk unlikely benefit patient randomize experimental arm , DSMB recommend enrollment study permanently halt bevacizumab discontinue patient randomized experimental arm . On May 31 , 2010 , sponsor take decision stop enrollment study bevacizumab treatment terminate immediate effect recommend DSMB . The study protocol amend . The primary objective study change evaluation efficacy evaluation safety study extend include 18-month safety follow-up period . Because enrollment terminate prematurely result few enrol patient plan , outcome measure data premature due few expected event . The time frame report serious adverse event modify . Serious adverse event ( SAE ) unrelated study treatment report 1 year post-treatment new anti-lymphoma treatment initiate . SAEs judge related study treatment congestive heart failure event report time study .</detailed_description>
