	<brief_title>Sevelamer , Fetuin-A Endothelial Dysfunction CKD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CKD stage 4 patient old 18 year age willing participate study screen . Those serum phosphorus &gt; 5.5 mg/dl evaluate study . Patients diabetes mellitus , history coronary artery disease , smoker take statin renin-angiotensin blocker exclude effect factor endothelial dysfunction . Of 62 screen patient 50 meet study criterion include study . Thirty-two healthy subject study control . The ethical committee Gulhane School Medicine approve study write informed consent obtain patient . Study design : This randomize study conduct 2005 2006 Gulhane School Medicine . The Outpatient Clinic Department Nephrology tertiary referral center . At admission , patient untreated ( include phosphate binder ) treat antihypertensive agent . After first evaluation , patient receive phosphate binder ( n=9 ) underwent 2-week washout period . Patients develop phosphate level &gt; 5.5 mg/dl period include study . Patients randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive sevelamer ( Renagel capsule ) calcium acetate ( Phos Ex tablet ) . The treatment phase 8 week . During study period serum calcium phosphorus concentration measure every 2 week dose phosphate binder titrate achieve serum phosphorus concentration &lt; 5.5 mg/dl . The start dose sevelamer 1-2 capsule ( 800 mg ) three time day calcium acetate ( 1000 mg ) 1 tablet three time day . The medication give meal dos increase need . Patients give calcitriol study period . Fasting blood sample take study measure serum creatinine , serum albumin , hs-CRP , insulin , iPTH , lipid profile serum fetuin-A concentration . Additionally , flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ) also evaluate study .</detailed_description>
