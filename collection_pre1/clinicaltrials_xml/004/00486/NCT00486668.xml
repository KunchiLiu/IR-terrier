	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine whether breast cancer tumor respond ( measure pathologic complete response : absence microscopic evidence invasive tumor cell breast ) combine chemotherapy AC ( doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ) follow paclitaxel plus trastuzumab lapatinib give surgery patient HER2-positive breast cancer . Trastuzumab also give patient surgery . The study also evaluate toxic effect chemotherapy combination , include effect heart , determine survival progression-free survival 5 year treatment . Also , study look whether gene expression profile tumor tissue predict pathologic complete response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study AC Followed Combination Paclitaxel Plus Trastuzumab Lapatinib Both Given Before Surgery Patients With Operable HER2 Positive Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women breast cancer overexpress HER2 great risk disease progression death woman whose tumor overexpress HER2 . Trastuzumab , recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody extracellular domain HER2 protein block downstream signal HER2 substantially improve efficacy chemotherapy woman metastatic early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer . Because resistance trastuzumab eventually result progressive disease metastatic setting contributes recurrence follow adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy , important develop agent trastuzumab target HER2 signal different mechanism action . Lapatinib oral , small molecule , dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor HER2 EGFR . Lapatinib show lack cross-resistance trastuzumab preclinical study activity woman HER2-positive , metastatic breast cancer progress trastuzumab treatment . Trastuzumab block downstream signal HER2 bind extracellular domain receptor . Lapatinib bind intracellular domain HER2 EGFR prevent activation downstream signal pathway . Because different mechanism action , lapatinib may effective trastuzumab-resistant disease . The study also provide important safety information trastuzumab lapatinib combination immediately follow anthracycline exposure , also provide initial direct comparison cardiac effect trastuzumab lapatinib incorporate standard sequential AC follow weekly paclitaxel ( neo ) adjuvant regimen . Availability second agent interrupt HER2-signaling pathway completely different mechanism trastuzumab offer potential improvement management patient HER2-overexpressing breast cancer adjuvant metastatic setting . Co-administration trastuzumab lapatinib chemotherapy may important improve outcomes subset HER2-positive breast cancer . However , use two inhibitor HER2 pathway increase cost may increase toxicity , important identify subset patient would benefit dual therapy . Inhibition HER2 single agent clearly sufficient many patient evidence result trastuzumab trial . Therefore , co-administration unselected population woman HER2-positive breast cancer would represent optimal approach . Given activity lapatinib , likely also sufficiently active inhibit HER2-pathway activation patient allow use sole inhibitor HER2 pathway . Different population may also derive great benefit one HER2-blocking agent relative . Identification potential predictive factor pathologic complete response combination either agent administer alone neoadjuvant trial would provide important information adjuvant trial design definitively address important issue . This study compare 3 combined chemotherapy regimen : AC follow paclitaxel plus trastuzumab lapatinib , AC follow paclitaxel plus lapatinib , AC follow paclitaxel plus trastuzumab give surgery patient HER2-positive breast cancer .</detailed_description>
