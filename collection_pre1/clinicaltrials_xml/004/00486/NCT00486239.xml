	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) memory emotional functioning . The study evaluate know lateralized neurological dysfunction ( Right TLE versus Left TLE ) emotional verbal visual memory function . Study data ass ability participant know lateralized neurological dysfunction ( Right TLE versus Left TLE ) differentially perceive emotional stimulus . Another component study evaluate possible change memory function emotionally charge material follow right left temporal lobectomy treatment medically intractable epilepsy . It expect participant know lateralized dysfunction exhibit differential ability discriminate emotional charge visual verbal material .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epilepsy relatively common neurological disorder diagnose individual suffer repeat unprovoked seizure . Estimates prevalence rate vary , generally consider 1 % U.S. population . Of patient diagnosed epilepsy , 60-70 percent diagnose complex-partial seizure , 30-40 percent medication refractory . The majority individual medically refractory epilepsy seizure arise temporal lobe area , label Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ( TLE ) . Patients TLE experience neurological psychiatric comorbidity . The surgical treatment patient medically refractory epilepsy become increasingly recognize effective treatment reduce eliminate seizure select patient . Up 90 percent select participant TLE seizure free year follow temporal lobectomy . However , patient undergo neurological surgery medication refractory epilepsy experience variety cognitive emotional comorbid complication . These include decline memory language function well onset depression , anxiety , , rarely , de novo psychosis report . This study assess material specific memory emotion function subject medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy . The incorporation neuropsychological assessment pre-surgical evaluation patient diagnose medically refractory epilepsy successful reduce risk individual experience catastrophic decline memory language function follow neurological surgery . However , material specific memory loss remain problematic issue surgical treatment TLE . Despite 30 year research , remain question lateralize function mesial temporal structure . In addition , become increasingly recognize emotional function patient medically refractory epilepsy relate quality life functional outcome follow temporal lobectomy . Indeed , post-surgical symptom depression anxiety significantly relate patient quality life , less extent , seizure freedom . Initial result suggest patient right TLE great risk post-surgical emotional difficulty ; however , recent data question earlier observation suggest hemisphere dominance little affect psychiatric outcome . There little doubt neurological surgery medically refractory significantly decrease , many instance , eliminate seizure patient . However , individual risk cognitive emotional comorbidity medical treatment remain paucity empirical study help guide treatment . Despite increase empirical evaluation emotional ( psychiatric ) status individual medically refractory epilepsy , paucity data explore interaction learn emotion function . The purpose study prospectively evaluate memory function individual medically refractory TLE emotional material . In addition , component study evaluate difference ability evaluate emotional content stimulus . Data participant epilepsy compare control group healthy volunteer . The stimuli consist positive negative material . It suspect data , future , improve pre-surgical evaluation individual medically refractory epilepsy reduce risk person pronounce psychiatric complication follow temporal lobectomy .</detailed_description>
