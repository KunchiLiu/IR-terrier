	<brief_summary>There currently curative treatment child relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma , child 5 year survival rate &lt; 10 % . As , new therapeutic approach need treat child . This Phase 1 clinical trial specifically design test safety toxicity nifurtimox give combination cyclophosphamide topotecan treatment relapse and/or refractory neuroblastoma . Prior study opening , 3 pediatric patient neuroblastoma receive nifurtimox combination chemotherapy regimen , significant measurable response without undue toxicity . These case report , well vitro vivo investigation biologic effect nifurtimox neuroblastoma cell prompt development Phase I study . This Phase I study involve dose escalation trial daily oral nifurtimox alone one 21 day cycle therapy , follow continuation nifurtimox addition standard dos cyclophosphamide ( 5 day ) topotecan ( 5 day ) 3 additional 21 day cycle . Our primary aim evaluate safety nifurtimox alone combination chemotherapy agent multiply relapsed/refractory patient . Our secondary aim evaluate pharmacokinetics nifurtimox well treatment response .</brief_summary>
