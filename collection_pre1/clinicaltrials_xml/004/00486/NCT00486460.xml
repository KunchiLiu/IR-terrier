	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer aggressive disease extremely poor prognosis . It forth lead cause cancer-related fatality , estimate one-year five-year survival rate 21 % 5 % , respectively . Despite recent progress , median survival time 6-10 month patient locally advanced disease 3-6 month metastatic disease ( 1 ) . The anti-metabolite gemcitabine become standard chemotherapy locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer , demonstrate improve rate clinical benefit response overall survival advantage 5-FU ( 2 ) . In addition clinical effectiveness gemcitabine manageable toxicity profile , make attractive agent investigate combination new agent . Series phase III trial conduct examine efficacy combination gemcitabine second cytotoxic agent , include 5-FU , cisplatin , oxaliplatin irinotecan . These gemcitabine doublet demonstrate survival advantage single-agent gemcitabine ( 3-6 ) . However , rationale continue study gemcitabine-based combination remain compelling . Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane ) natural compound derive rhizome Curcuma Longa , East Indian plant , commonly call turmeric . It show possess potent anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative property , long history dietary use food additive . Curcumin also potent anti-proliferative effect variety cancer cell line vitro , stem ability modulate many intracellular signal transduction pathway ( 7 ) . Human phase I-II study find curcumin safe , indicate dose-limiting toxicity take mouth dos 10 g/day ( 8 , 9 ) . This data , together dismal therapeutic option available pancreatic cancer patient , suggest curcumin warrant investigation set . Investigators MD Anderson Cancer Center Rambam Medical Center Haifa , recently initiate , separately , phase II study single agent Curcumin patient pancreatic cancer ( 10 ) . One lesson learn cancer research recent decade combination strategy provide dramatic improvement therapy ’ safety efficacy mono-therapeutic regiment , especially combine drug differ mode action . In recent paper accept publication demonstrate , vitro , mechanism , clinical importance implication novel combinatorial therapy , celecoxib curcumin , discover lab , inhibit growth several pancreatic cell line . P-34 ( express high level COX -2 ) , MiaPaca ( Expressing low level COX-2 ) Panc-1 ( expression COX -2 ) cell line expose different concentration celecoxib ( 0-40µM ) , curcumin ( 0-20µM ) combination . In P-34 cell , curcumin synergistically potentiate inhibitory effect celecoxib cell growth . The growth inhibition associate inhibition proliferation induction apoptosis . These experiment demonstrate , first time , combination effect correlate synergistic augmentation apoptosis involve down-regulation COX-2 protein . The present study evaluate gemcitabine combination curcumin celecoxib patient pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
