	<brief_title>Study Determine Shock Wave Therapy Applied Traumatic Wounds Extremity Improves Healing Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Timely return combat wound functional life duty imperative . Reliance upon traditional wound management principle restrictive , treatment paradigm aim high-energy projectile contaminate wound suit requirement combat casualty care program . The nature war wound make unsuitable conventional , saline-soaked-gauze dressing . Extra-corporeal-shockwave-therapy ( ESWT ) use successfully orthopedic soft tissue indication . Pilot study indicate ESWT enhances tissue heal growth-factor release neovascularization , favorable safety profile anti-bacterial effect , particularly problematic wound include fracture non-unions , post-traumatic wound , burn . The need improve heal quality-of-life combat wound , potential minimal-risk technology improve heal difficult-to-treat orthopedic/soft tissue injury infection , well combat casualty care experience surgeon WRAMC , dovetail uniquely wound soldier medical center play pivotal role fundamental prove ground primary beneficiary technology . Comparison ( ) : Standard-of-care wound therapy compare standard-of-care wound therapy + ESWT extremity wound aim conduct definitive critical analysis role ESWT improve treatment outcome traumatic soft tissue injury extremity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year age old , capable providing inform consent indicate awareness investigational nature trial , keep institutional policy . Written informed consent must obtain patient prior enter study . Female patient pregnant . Exclusion possibility pregnancy HCG testing ( urine serum ) history ( tubal ligation , hysterectomy , menopause ) require prior inclusion study . Patients willing follow within military healthcare system , participate civilian center course study treatment followup . Patients traumatic wound ( ) upper and/or low extremity . The study wind wound high Red Cross Wound Classification ( RCWC ) . Patients demonstrate adequacy limb perfusion follow clinical parameter affect extremity treat investigational shock wave therapy : Palpable distal extremity pulse ; Absence compartment syndrome ; Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) ≥ 0.9 transcutaneous pulse oximetry , tcP02≥20mmHg . Patients noncircumferential , second degree burn wound upper and/or low extremity . Patients current participation another clinical investigation medical device drug requirement may preclude complete involvement study . Women pregnant . One follow finding affect extremity treat investigational shock wave therapy : Ankle Brachial Index &lt; 0.9 tcP02 &lt; 20 mmHg ; Significant arterial venous injury require surgical intervention ; Lymphedema . Subject another nonsuperficial wound near study wind less 3cm study wind RCWC 3 . Active previous ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) chemotherapy . Active previous ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) radiation affect extremity treat investigational shock wave therapy . Physical mental disability geographical concern ( residence within reasonable travel distance ) would hamper compliance require study visit . The Investigator believe subject unwilling unable comply study protocol requirement , include shock wave treatment procedure , standardofcare selfcare requirement , studyrelated follow visit requirement . Patients 1st degree , 3rd degree , circumferential extremity burn consider treatment investigational shock wave therapy . History sickle cell anemia . History infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus . History immunodeficiency disorder . Severe anemia Hgb &lt; 7 g/dl ( male ) &lt; 6.5 ( female ) . Deep vein thrombosis within 6 month study screen visit .
