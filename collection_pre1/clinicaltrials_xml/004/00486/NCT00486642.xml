	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give pazopanib without bicalutamide work treat patient prostate cancer respond hormone therapy . Pazopanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , bicalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Giving pazopanib hydrochloride together bicalutamide may effective treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride With Without Bicalutamide Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine therapeutic activity GW786034 ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) without bicalutamide treatment hormone-refractory prostate cancer use prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) -response rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective tumor response patient measurable disease . II . To estimate median time progression . III . To investigate safety tolerability GW786034 without bicalutamide . IV . To estimate median duration PSA-response . V. To determine steady state level GW786034 without bicalutamide . VI . To investigate correlation prior exposure bicalutamide non-steroidal anti-androgens response survival outcome . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-28 . Patients also receive bicalutamide PO QD day 8-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Courses arm repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week 12 week .</detailed_description>
