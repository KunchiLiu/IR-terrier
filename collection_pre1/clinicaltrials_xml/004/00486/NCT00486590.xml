	<brief_summary>Prolacta Bioscience develop first purely human fortifier , Prolact-Plus , provide source many require nutrient premature , newborn infant , particularly protein calorie . This product make donor human milk skim ( non-lipid portion ) separate concentrate . A certain amount lipid content add back achieve high caloric content within small delivery volume . The product pasteurize fill small quantity order allow addition mother 's milk ( , possibly , milk another donor ) . The goal preparation achieve increase approximately 4 cal/oz mother 's milk provide protein level ( mixed average pre-term milk ) 3.5-3.8 g/100 Kcal feed . The data Prolact-Plus obtain prospectively infants receive human milk fortify fashion . The data standard , bovine ( cow ) -fortified milk obtain retrospectively medical record participate institution . While design necessarily optimal setting , efficient quick approach evaluate acute clinical effect Prolact-Plus . It anticipate study conduct examine longer-term account possibly control , randomize environment . The goal study evaluate short-term effect Prolact-Plus fortify human milk compare bovine-based fortification human milk parameter growth short-term development , infectious complication incidence feed intolerance cohort design . Statistically , study attempt evaluate null hypothesis equivalent result respect parameter two type fortifiers compare two-sided alternative ( difference group ) . In addition , data collect overall survival length stay NICU . These data collect descriptive purpose , although attempt make compare finding obtain bovine-based fortifier .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Prolact-Plus Human Milk Fortifier</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cohort design study pre-term infant ( &lt; 32 week gestation ) compare bovine fortify ( use one commercially available fortifier product ) human milk Prolact-Plus ( human ) fortify human milk former cohort obtain retrospectively latter obtain prospectively participate institution . The number infant include study minimum 50 group complete 30 day study . ( If baby drop study prior 30 day evaluation , would replace order achieve number . ) This sample size determine statistically , rather base solely desire obtain reasonable amount data evaluate new human fortifier setting . However , perspective non-inferiority evaluation endpoint feed intolerance , consider follow . Assuming rate 15 % outcome retrospective cohort , 50 subject per cohort , study would able demonstrate lack inferiority human-based fortifier delta 20 % use power slightly great 80 % one-sided 2.5 % significance level . ( By `` delta 20 % '' imply theoretical feed intolerance rate Prolact-Plus worse 35 % would result conclusion lack inferiority give level significance power . ) Conversely , human-based fortifier able reduce feed intolerance rate 15 % 1 % , sample size trial , would doable 80 % power 5 % significance ( two-sided ) . ( Thus , trial , theory , also could demonstrate dramatic reduction rate . ) The retrospective data obtain available medical chart participate institution select infant reflect recently treat ( within 12 month period prior initiation prospective phase protocol ) number similar kind number treat prospectively institution .</detailed_description>
