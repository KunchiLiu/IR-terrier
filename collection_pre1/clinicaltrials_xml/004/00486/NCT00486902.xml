	<brief_summary>Pain control cesarean delivery associate improved breastfeeding infant rooming-in time . In addition , inadequate analgesia lead elevate plasma catecholamine concentration , negatively affect every organ system . There grow evidence ketamine , N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist , efficacious use adjuvant postoperative pain control . A 2006 Cochrane Collaboration systemic review meta-analysis conclude , `` Ketamine subanesthetic doses….is effective reduce morphine requirement first 24 hour surgery . '' Ketamine 's prolonged analgesic effect , despite short half-life use low dos , theorize due blockade spinal cord central sensitization . Central sensitization phenomenon whereby repeat painful stimulus lead severe pain perception time despite change intensity painful stimulus.Ketamine may also prevent development acute opioid tolerance . Ketamine 's analgesic effect also demonstrate obstetric population . Post-cesarean delivery morphine requirement woman receive ketamine part general anesthesia technique decrease . Similary , low-dose ketamine conjunction bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia reduce postoperative analgesic requirement compare bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia bupivacaine-fentanyl spinal anesthesia . In United States , healthy woman schedule elective cesarean delivery commonly receive spinal anesthesia bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine . To knowledge , IV ketamine study adjuvant regimen analgesic management post-cesarean delivery patient . Multimodal therapy postoperative pain control widely practice due advantage provide block multiple pain pathway minimize side effect individual pain medication . We hypothesize low dose intravenous ketamine improve multi-modal post-cesarean analgesia compare placebo . The purpose study evaluate hypothesis study possible side effect regimen combination bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine spinal anesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible woman elective cesarean section admit Labor Delivery Unit Prentice Women 's Hospital approach study participation immediately routine preanesthetic evaluation . This occur shortly admission Labor Delivery Unit . Women agree participate give write , inform consent time . Subjects prepare preoperatively usual fashion intravenous ( IV ) access , aspiration prophylaxis intraoperative monitoring . Preincision antibiotic give uterotonic medication use per usual practice delivery . The anesthesiologist perform spinal anesthetic per routine subject sit position use sterile technique L3-4 interspace ( ± one vertebral interspace ) . The spinal anesthetic consist 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine + 15 μg fentanyl + 150 μg morphine . The subject place supine leave lateral tilt alleviate aortocaval compression . Cesarean section commence adequate anesthesia assure T4 sensory level pinprick . Vasopressors IV fluid administer anesthesiologist 's discretion per usual practice . At time delivery , subject randomize one two group use computer generate random number table . Randomization block base whether cesarean procedure primary repeat procedure . Randomization assignment keep sequentially numbered opaque envelope . The envelope open research nurse prepare 20 mL syringe label `` study drug '' . The syringe give anesthesiologist blind treatment group subsequently administer study drug . Subjects randomized treatment group receive ketamine 10 mg ( ketamine 10 mg/mL ) dilute 20 mL 0.9 % preservative free saline . Subjects randomize placebo group receive 20 mL preservative free saline . The study drug administer intravenous line via infusion pump 10 minute . Five minute placebo drug administration , anesthesiologist ask subject nausea , vomit pruritus . Nausea pruritus grade none , mild , moderate severe ; vomit present absent . Any spontaneous complaint psychedelic effect note time . Sedation assess via Richmond agitation-sedation scale ( RASS [ see Appendix 1 ] ) . Upon completion cesarean section , subject transport post anesthesia recovery unit . Patients receive ketorolac 30 mg every 6 hour time 4 dos begin shortly admission PACU . At 1 h , 4 h , 8 h , 12 h 24 h administration study drug , subject 's pain assess use numeric rating scale pain NRS 0-10 ( see Appendix 2 ) . Patients may request rescue analgesia experience discomfort . The time first rescue analgesia request note , NRS determine time request rescue analgesia . Rescue medication consist hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg per o . An additional dose hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg provide 1 hour pain relieve subject 's satisfaction . These routine oral analgesic medication postoperative cesarean delivery analgesia . Standard order write monitoring sedation respiratory rate , treatment side effect ( nausea , vomit , pruritus respiratory depression ) . The total amount rescue medication determine subject 24 , 48 72 hour . The presence nausea , vomit , pruritus assess time interval NRS pain : 1 h , 4 h , 8 h , 12 h 24 h IV infusion ketamine placebo . The subjective psychedelic effect ketamine morphine assess use set true/false question LSD morphine short form Addiction Research Center Inventory , ARCI ( Appendix 3 ) . These question administer verbally anesthesiologist researcher blind treatment group upon admission PACU 4 h. The following data collect addition primary secondary outcome data : maternal age , height , weight , prepregnancy weight , gestational age IV fluid administer cesarean section . In addition , intraoperative postoperative medication record , include administer treatment side effect list . Protocol specific analgesia assessment end 24 hour administration study drug . At 72 hour subject ask satisfaction postoperative analgesia ( 100 mm scale , 0 mm = satisfy , 100 mm = satisfy ) . One telephone follow-up evaluation 2 week delivery , assess satisfaction analgesia average pain ( NRS ) since procedure .</detailed_description>
