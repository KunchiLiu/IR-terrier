	<brief_summary>This retrospective review chart echocardiograms patient Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection ( TAPVC ) . The Children 's Surgical non-invasive Echo database use determine TAPVC patient . Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Sibley Heart Center Cardiology chart echocardiograms TAPVC patient January 1 , 2002 November 26 , 2006 reviewed . We anticipate approximately 40 patient . We hypothesize presence descending aortic flow reversal correlate high morbidity mortality TAPVC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Review Descending Aortic Flow Reversal Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ( TAPVC ) congenital cardiac anomaly pulmonary vein fail connect usual anatomic location , leave atrium . This may lead critical cardio-pulmonary failure extreme cyanosis . This condition usually require urgent surgical repair . In many case , pulmonary vein may obstruct lead severe pulmonary hypertension low cardiac output may acutely life-threatening . In case , emergent surgical repair undertaken newborn period . Patients TAPVC may poor prognosis may difficult predict . We make unusual previously unreported observation echocardiography flow reversal upper descend aorta , indicate extremely reduce leave ventricular output patient TAPVC , poor outcome . This lead hypothesis descend aortic flow reversal portend poor prognosis TAPVC . The patient TAPVC divide two group presence absence descend aortic flow reversal . We , also , would evaluate presence associate cardiac anomaly . The second step study would review clinical chart patient evaluate serious co-morbidities mortality . Outcome measure would include mortality , chronic lung disease , continue oxygen requirement , recurrent respiratory infection , list transplantation , cardiopulmonary arrest requirement ECMO .</detailed_description>
