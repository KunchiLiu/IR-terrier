	<brief_summary>Many child undergo surgery congenital heart disease prior operation . Re-operative sternotomy carry risk cardiac injury need emergent peripheral cannulation . Our first aim demonstrate peripheral arterial cannulation may lifesaving case complicate sternal re-entry child angio-catheters utilized vessel small standard cannula . Our secondary aim present case report successful femoral cannulation 5 kg child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Femoral Arterial Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In child , many standard operative site either occlude , stenosed , small small manufactured cannula . In instance , may feasible utilize angio-catheters arterial access central cannulation achieve safely . In vitro model , simulate cardiopulmonary bypass circuit arterial cannulation angio-catheters . It appear angio-catheters may use acceptable flow hemodynamics blood vessel small standard cannula . We perform successfully 5 kg child . We complete cardiopulmonary bypass model ready submit hemodynamic data . We would like submit national meeting hopefully publication thereafter .</detailed_description>
