	<brief_title>Perfusion Imaging CT -Understanding Relative Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , multi-center , within-subject comparative study . One hundred fifty ( 150 ) subject CATH procedure need study . Approximately 300 subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol . The study population consist subject symptoms suspect intermediate-risk ischemic heart disease , refer MPS definitive diagnosis CAD . Each subject undergo follow procedure : - A Myocardial Perfusion Study ( MPS ) procedure , standard care ; - An IV contrast-enhanced cardiac CT ( CCTA ) procedure ; - A CATH procedure MPS and/or cardiac CT examination deem positive equivocal discretion refer physician , standard-of-care procedure . When MPS CCTA normal , subject require undergo CATH procedure , enter follow-up . The research staff site perform follow-up subject 12 month ( ± 15 day ) 24 month ( ± 15 day ) 36 month ( ± 15 day ) completion cardiac CT procedure .</detailed_description>
