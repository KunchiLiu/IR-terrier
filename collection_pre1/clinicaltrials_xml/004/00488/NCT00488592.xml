	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness two vaccine slow disease progression , improve blood count , reduce need transfusion blood platelet , achieve remission patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS , also know myelodysplasia ) , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . The vaccine consist peptide ( part protein ) find MDS , AML CML stem cell , combine substance call `` MontanideTM '' . They administer granulocyte- macrophage colony- stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . The Montanide GM-CSF help immune system respond vaccine . People 18 year age old MDS , AML CML may eligible study . Participants receive six injection vaccine , one dose every week total 10 week . The injection give upper arm , upper leg , abdomen . A separate injection GM-CSF give area vaccine injection . Subjects observe 2 hour first vaccination least 30 minute subsequent vaccination allergic reaction . In addition vaccination , subject undergo following : - History physical exam , chest x-ray , blood test bone marrow aspirate biopsy start vaccination . - Safety monitoring vaccine administration ( every week 10 week ) blood test check vital sign . - Follow-up safety monitoring ( week 12 16 ) blood test every visit , chest x-ray week 12 bone marrow biopsy visit 16 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Leukemias related disorder myelodysplastic syndrome myeloproliferative disease represent wide group bone marrow stem cell malignancy . Some patient cure chemotherapy allogeneic stem cell transplantation . However standard treatment approach effective patient become refractory chemotherapy , relapse transplantation progressive disease . The management patient remain unsatisfactory require new treatment approach chemotherapy . The immunological graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effect see allogeneic stem cell transplantation suggest stimulate patient 's T cell response MDS leukemia vaccine might also retard disease progression even achieve disease remission . Peptide ( WT1 ) peptide ( PR1 ) identify target antigen antigens highly express cluster differentiation 34 ( CD34 ) plus stem cell patient myeloid malignancy normal marrow cell . An immunotherapeutic approach vaccinate PR1 WT1 antigen could induce T cell response MDS leukemic cell spar normal cell use combination two antigen risk disease escape antigen regulation diminish . Indeed safety study one dose combination peptide ( PRl ) ( WT1 ) vaccination , demonstrate immunological response one vaccine could induce subject vaccinate . This immunological response associate transient reduction leukemia burden . Furthermore vaccine combination well tolerate . Therefore propose Phase II trial , third series plan peptide vaccine research protocol , evaluate safety efficacy associate immunotherapy approach use two peptide vaccine , namely PR 1 : 169- 177 WT-1 : 126-1 34 Montanide adjuvant , administer concomitantly GM-CSF ( Sargramostim ) , every 2 week 10 week ( 6 dos WT1 plus 6 dos PRl plus GM-CSF ) select patient diagnose MDS , AML CML . Subjects immunological response one peptide vaccines option receive additional 6 booster WT-1:126-135 PR1:169-177 peptide vaccine 3 monthly interval . The primary objective evaluate efficacy toxicity associate 6 dos combination WT-1 : 126-134 PRl : 169-177 peptide vaccine Montanide adjuvant administer concomitantly GMCSF ( Sargramostim ) select patient myeloid malignancy ( MDS , AML , CML ) . The primary endpoint immune response ( study change frequency circulate PR1 WT1 specific T cell ) serve surrogate evaluate efficacy study . Secondary Endpoints include change marrow blast cell , blood count , transfusion dependence , time disease progression survival .</detailed_description>
