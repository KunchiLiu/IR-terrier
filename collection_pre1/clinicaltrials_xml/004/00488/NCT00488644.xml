	<brief_title>Combined Levothyroxine/Liothyronine Supplementation Hypothyroid Patients With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothyroidism cause body able produce enough thyroid hormone . Levothyroxine liothyronine synthetic ( man-made ) hormone may help treat hypothyroidism increase metabolism ( activity ) cell tissue body . The combination treatment , give patient hypothyroidism , may help improve normal body brain functioning . Levothyroxine man-made type hormone make release thyroid gland ( thyroxine [ T4 ] ) . Liothyronine also man-made type hormone , make thyroid gland ( triiodothyronine [ T3 ] ) . Both levothyroxine liothyronine effect different function body help regulate ( control ) activity amount energy cell use . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history record . You neuropsychological evaluation ( series test evaluate well brain performing ) . This evaluation include interview , test perform check memory , language , think ability . You neurological exam perform , include measurement weight , height , performance status ( well able perform daily activity ) . This do within 14 day start study . You blood collect ( 2 tablespoon ) routine laboratory test ( free T4 , total T3 ) patient hypothyroidism . You also give 4 questionnaire fill ask general QoL change mood . These questionnaire take 20 minute total complete . If find eligible take part study , receive standard dose levothyroxine ( blood collect laboratory test physical measurement take ) mouth . You receive liothyronine mouth Day 1 study neuro-cognitive test ( evaluate well brain performing ) . The dose liothyronine receive depend dose levothyroxine already . Approximately 4 week start treatment , call research data coordinator research nurse ask question symptom hyperthyroidism may . This case dose liothyronine high may need adjust . You receive levothyroxine liothyronine 8 week . However , take study , disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . You ask return hospital 8 week first visit end-of-study visit . You another neuropsychological evaluation perform . Blood ( around 2 tablespoon ) collect test level free T4 total T3 body . You also physical measurement take . You receive another standard dose levothyroxine . You another neurocognitive test perform , give 4 questionnaire evaluate QoL change mood . The questionnaire take 20 minute total complete . Your participation study end-of-study visit . This investigational study . Liothyronine levothyroxine approve FDA hypothyroidism commercially available . However , use drug combination experimental . Up 26 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
