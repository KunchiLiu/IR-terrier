	<brief_summary>A research study find specific white blood cell call dendritic cell . These cell find layer fat body call omentum . The omentum layer fat cover bowel ( intestine ) protects . The purpose study allow u compare dendritic cell normal weight individual dendritic cell people extremely overweight . These cell collect omentum , layer fat cover protects bowel ( intestine ) , mesentery , another layer fat surround intestine directly , subcutaneous tissue , layer fat skin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity continue major source morbidity mortality United States . The association obesity type II diabetes well know . Several study suggest fat may generate low grade inflammatory response may responsible metabolic change obese patient . More specifically , certain type white blood cell cause inflammation call dendritic cell find high concentration omental fat . This cell extensively studied human patient morbid obesity , though may play central role development insulin resistance . Aside weight loss , surgical treatment obesity also result decrease marker inflammation . Many comorbidities morbid obesity improve cure . Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding safer gastric bypass procedure result similar amount weight loss 2 year postoperatively . Much work regard dendritic cell human subject patient Crohn 's disease . Both cytokine profile characteristic dendritic cell extensively study Crohn 's patient , obese individual . In addition , cell re-evaluated period weight loss . A detailed analysis inflammation obesity subsequent resolution weight loss contribute grow body information subject . Further work lend insight pathogenesis comorbidities obesity may contribute uncover potential treatment illness . Dendritic cell extensively study animal model . We know specific cell surface marker signal pathway cell , response stimulate factor , ability secrete anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 . We hope translate finding human . It recognize chronic low-grade inflammation critical element lead insulin resistance insulin target cell . The evidence substantial , include consistent measurement elevate inflammatory marker plasma insulin resistance/diabetic human rodent . This concept establish recent discovery obese adipose tissue contain large number resident macrophage . In fact , lean state , 10 % cell type within adipose tissue consist macrophage , number go high 50 % obesity . Furthermore , FACS sort adipose tissue macrophage base surface marker , indicate subpopulation macrophage account remarkable increase . This subpopulation involve macrophage positive F4/80 , CD11B CD11C , therefore , dendritic-like phenotype . There also report literature suggest visceral adipose tissue may particularly `` inflame '' compare subcutaneous adipose tissue increase macrophage infiltration inflammatory marker express visceral fat . More recent evidence , macrophage inflammatory pathway specifically disabled , knock-out mouse , conclusively demonstrate macrophage initiate orchestrate cell type responsible inflammatory response ultimately lead systemic insulin resistance . These concept assess use subcutaneous visceral fat sample obtain protocol . The adipose tissue sample collagenase digest release adipocytes non-adipocyte cell type within tissue . Using differential centrifugation filtration , stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) separate adipocytes . The SVF contain macrophage , cell undergo FACS analysis base expression F4/80 , CD11B CD11C determine absolute number macrophage within give adipose tissue sample , proportion classical macrophage versus dendritic cell-like macrophage . The cell sort , inflammatory marker expression measure classical macrophage ( F4/80 positive , CD11B positive , CD11C negative ) versus dendritic-like cell ( F480 positive , CD11B positive , CD11C positive ) . This analysis involve direct measurement cytokine expression cell ( TNF , IL-1 , IL-6 ) well PCR-based measurement mRNA expression inflammatory pathway component . These measurement perform subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue obtain time initial surgery , well subcutaneous adipose tissue sample follow weight reduction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For gastric banding subject qualify study inclusion , subject BMI range 3340 . Currently BMI 33 low level acceptable bypass . Subjects BMI &gt; 40 exclude fat cell large therefore fragile unsuitable research use . Control Group : All adult subject 18 year great see minimally invasive surgery clinic elective laparoscopic surgery also screen . These subject nonobese ( BMI &lt; 30 ) undergo laparoscopic surgery different indication hernia repair cholecystectomy . These patient undergo elective procedure minimize impact acute inflame abdomen may fat cell . Women pregnant planning become pregnant exclude study . Gastric band perform pregnant woman .</criteria>
