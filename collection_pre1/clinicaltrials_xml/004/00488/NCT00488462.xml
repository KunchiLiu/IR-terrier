	<brief_summary>This trial address question whether early application Non-pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment ( NASG ) Satellite Health Facility ( SHF ) level transport Referral Hospital ( RH ) decrease maternal mortality morbidity . The available evidence indicate NASG substantially decrease blood loss , evidence application reduce extreme adverse outcome . It also know possible side effect associate NASG use might outweigh potential benefit . This study would rigorously test effectiveness NASG use experimental design adequate power detect statistically significant decrease morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study cluster randomize controlled trial examine effect NASG application first-aid device SHFs transfer Referral Hospitals ( RHs ) . The first step include start-up activity formative data collection , include facility staff train data collection , collect blood closed-end blood collection drape , evidence-based standardized clinical protocol obstetric hemorrhage prevention hemorrhage shock management . Next period baseline data collection RHs SHFs , clinical demographic data collect woman diagnose obstetric hemorrhage shock . After baseline data collection period , introduce study intervention , initially RHs SHFs . The intervention include : review study protocol difference baseline NASG-intervention phase , provision NASG , detail training use NASG health care provider staff , well on-site support supervision use NASG . After RH provider fully train become proficient NASG use , SHFs randomize 19 intervention 19 control facility . Intervention SHFs receive NASG training describe , control SHFs receive refresher training topic include baseline training . The final step three year NASG-intervention data collection RHs SHFs woman diagnose obstetric hemorrhage shock outcome collect baseline period . A total approximately 2,340 woman SHFs include NASG-intervention data collection phase cluster randomize trial : 1,170 woman intervention group 1,170 woman control group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To participate study activity , woman must willing able participate , able sign mark consent form , speak one languages consent form translate , include English , Nyanja , Bemba Zambia , English , Shona Ndebele Zimbabwe . Women pregnant postpartum experience obstetric hemorrhage 2 follow 3 : blood loss &gt; 500 mL ( SHF , 1000 mL RH ) SBP &lt; 100 mm Hg pulse &gt; 100 bpm Absolute exclusion criterion include : current viable third trimester intrauterine pregnancy deliver next 20 minute hemorrhage begin and/or current bleeding site diaphragm . Relative exclusion criterion include : history current clinical evidence mitral stenosis congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . These must relative contraindication assessed time hemorrhage clinical judgment need utilized evaluate case individually . Thus patient transport deliver rapidly suspect known valvular heart disease , exclude study . In case , depend severity hemorrhage , patient dyspneic NASG , SHF level , NASG loosen , result relief , NASG remove . If patient RH decrease oxygen saturation level demonstrate pulse oximeter , NASG loosen , result relief , NASG remove . Women suffer obstetric hemorrhage hypovolemic shock detectable vital sign ( non palpable pulse BP ) time arrival RH ineligible enrolment study ( `` nonresuscitable '' ) : 1 ) woman respond resuscitation attempt 30 minute 2 ) three hour elapse start hemorrhage begin treatment . ( As clinical intervention potentially life save device , study clinician try NASG patient feel may resuscitate ; however , woman meet criteria ineligible data enter study . )</criteria>
