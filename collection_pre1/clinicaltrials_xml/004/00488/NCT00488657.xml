	<brief_summary>This project systematically examine therapeutic effect alter auditory feedback provide in-the-ear device speech impairment patient Parkinson 's disease . Many patient PD difficulty start speech even though know word want say . They experience 'freezing ' jaw , tongue lip . When eventually get speech start , hard time move forward . They keep say word phrase voice get soft softer . Many word also run together . These symptom make patient ' speech hard understand directly affect care quality life . Currently , effective medical surgical treatment speech symptom . We test in-the-ear therapeutic device provide altered auditory feedback eight patient PD moderate severe speech impairment result encourage . We recruit 100 patient PD moderate severe speech impairment Phase A 20 Phase B study . They use device routinely provide altered auditory feedback speak improve speech intelligibility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improve Speech Using In-the-ear Device Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Speech problem common patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . At early stage , patient may find hard project voice . As disease progress , patient start difficulty start speech even though know word want say . They experience 'freezing ' jaw , tongue lip . When eventually get speech start , hard time move forward . They keep say word phrase voice get soft softer . Many word also run together slur . These symptom make patient ' speech hard understand directly affect care quality life . Unfortunately , symptom respond medication surgery like non-speech motor symptom . In fact , surgical treatment could even make speech bad motor function walk improves . Traditional behavior therapy speech symptom successful either symptom control voluntarily . Recently , test in-the-ear therapeutic device provide altered auditory feedback eight patient PD moderate severe speech impairment . The device house hearing aid shell , programmable . Patients wear device one ear heard speech short time delay shift pitch speak . The delay range 50-220 m pitch shift 500-2,000 Hz . For patient , specific combination time-delay pitch-shift found . Our preliminary result encourage . Seven eight PD patient make significant improvement speech , much easy understand use device . This project systematically examine therapeutic effect alter auditory feedback provide in-the-ear device speech impairment PD . We recruit 100 patient PD moderate severe speech impairment Phase A 20 Phase B study . The Phase A study single visit Phase B study one-year period patient use device provide alter auditory feedback speak . Both short-term long-term benefit alter auditory feedback speech monitor . Based result preliminary study , expect patient ' speech improve . We hypothesize use altered auditory feedback provide salient sensory information trigger ancillary loop allow PD patient initiate speech easily maintain constant speaking rate , thus make speech intelligible . This project potential significantly impact quality life patient PD . When PD patient express want needs communicate effectively family , caretaker physician , quality life improve .</detailed_description>
