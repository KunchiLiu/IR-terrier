	<brief_summary>To discover whether Omega-3 fatty acid ( eicosapentaenoic acid/EPA docosahexaensyre/DHA ) enrich nutritional supplement give 7 day preoperatively 7 day postoperatively may reduce frequency postoperative infectious complication define : pneumonia , wound infection , urinary tract infection , peritonitis ( include anastomotic leakage ) septic condition cause patient undergo elective operation colorectal cancer compare nutritional preparation identical apart EPA content .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids Postoperative Complications After Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several early study indicate perioperative supplement Omega-3 fatty acid reduce risk postoperative complication major surgery immune modulate effect form downward adjustment inflammatory response . ( 1-7 ) The interpretation study make difficult difference method administration ( parentally/enterally ) , difference time intervention ( preoperative/postoperative ) difference selection patient ( malnourished cancer patient / upper GI cancer patients/mixed surgical patient ) finally many study deal so-called immune modulate preparation contain mixture arginine , Omega-3 fatty acid ribonucleic acid . The biological effect fish oil relate content thing Omega-3 fatty acid incorporate cell membrane influence receptor function , enzyme activity production lipid mediator . The cell immune system perform function membrane-associated activity like secretion cytokine , antibody , lymphocyte transformation contact lysine . These function affect change membrane structure . ( 7 ; 8 ) Besides effect parameter postoperative septic complication , many study use pseudoparameters length stay , need respirator treatment , time intensive care well wide range biochemical change whose relevance clinic process difficult ass . ( 1-7 ; 9-13 ; ) . It well-known early enteral nutrition reduces risk postoperative complication ( 14 ; 15 ) . Many aforementioned study similarly point benefit use Omega-3 fatty acid enrich nutritional preparation preoperatively . There commercially manufacture nutritional preparation peroral consumption contain Omega-3 fatty acid - Supportan ( Fresenius-Kabi ) . The preparation energy intensive similar drink preparation , otherwise differ composition standard preparation . It approve Danish Veterinary Food Administration study . In 2 x 200ml Supportan 3 g EPA DHA give daily . In study 10 g give daily without side effect . ( 6 ; 16 )</detailed_description>
