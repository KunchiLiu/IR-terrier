Your right arm muscle diameter , skin fold thickness shoulder blade , front back right arm , right hip bone , front right thigh measure use skinfold caliper . The caliper device use outside body measure skin thickness . You also ask stand special scale send extremely low energy , high frequency electrical signal one foot foot . You able feel . The device use speed signal travel body 's tissue calculate body fat weight body fat percentage . These number use together determine body fat , lean body weight , water content body . This do Days 1 , 15 , 29 . Participants group ask keep 3 weekly diary : food diary , pill diary recording mirtazapine take , daily log symptom may experience cancer treatment begin study .
