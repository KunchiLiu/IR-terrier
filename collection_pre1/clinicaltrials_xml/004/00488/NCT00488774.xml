	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Golimumab Participants With Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither Physician participant know study medication ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance ; pretend treatment [ drug ] compare clinical trial drug test drug real effect ) , parallel-group ( medical research study compare response 2 group participant receive different intervention [ treatment ] ) study evaluate appropriate intravenous ( vein arm ) golimumab induction dose demonstrate safety efficacy intravenous induction dose golimumab participant moderately severely active UC . At Week 6 , participant ask participate additional 1-year maintenance study . Participants enter 1-year golimumab maintenance study evaluate safety Week 16 . The duration study 6 week participant enter 1-year golimumab maintenance study 16 week participant enter 1-year golimumab maintenance study.There 2 part study . Part 1 Phase 2 `` dose-ranging '' portion study . Participants enrol Part 1 , receive single intravenous infusion either match placebo golimumab 1 milligram ( mg ) per kilogram ( kg ) , 2 mg per kg 4 mg per kg golimumab . Part 2 study call `` dose-confirming '' newly enrol participant receive dos study Part 1 , dos Part 2 select Phase 3 begin . At time final dos select , newly enrol participant receive 1 select dos match placebo ; start Phase 3 portion study . Participants primarily assess use Mayo Score ( score develop measure disease activity ) . Participants ' safety quality life also monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
