	<brief_summary>This study ass safety effectiveness endovascular treatment aortic aneurysm involve proximal aortic arch . The investigational operation involve place stent-graft aortic aneurysm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Branched Aortic Arch Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An aneurysm localize bulge wall artery . Aneurysms aorta prone progressive dilatation , leave untreated ultimately result rupture , internal bleeding death . Traditional open surgery involve aortic exposure long incision , aortic clamp interrupt blood flow , replacement repair dilate aortic segment use fabric conduit ( graft ) , suture ( anastomosis ) nondilated artery aneurysm . Some subject able withstand large operation well others , many suffer complication , suffer pain , debility , lengthy stay hospital . Endovascular aneurysm repair less invasive alternative substitute trans-arterial route aneurysm direct exposure , stent-mediated attachment suture anastomosis . Compared open surgical repair , endovascular repair associate less physiological derangement , less pain , less blood loss , low complication rate shorter hospital stay . Consequently , endovascular repair become standard therapy aneurysms abdominal aorta descend thoracic aorta , vital branch endovascular exclusion rarely cause ischemic complication . Open surgical repair proximal aortic arch require hypothermic circulatory arrest , deprive heart outflow brain inflow . Endovascular repair also obstruct outflow heart , second , graft release delivery sheath . The great problem inflow brain . In anticipation aortic arch exclusion , brachiocephalic circulation require alternative source blood . One alternative bypass ascend aorta . However , require median sternotomy partial aortic clamping , potential source morbidity .</detailed_description>
