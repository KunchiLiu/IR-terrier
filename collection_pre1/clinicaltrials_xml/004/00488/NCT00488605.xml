	<brief_title>H-9926-LCH III : Treatment Protocol Third International Study Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapy `` LOW RISK '' Patients : The decision research program assign make entirely chance . The overall time therapy 6 12 month randomly assign . The research program drug Vinblastine Prednisone . Initial Therapy 1 . Prednisone give mouth three time day daily four-week course , gradually decrease 2 week . 2 . Vinblastine give IV ( vein ) one day week 6 week . 3 . Patients evidence active disease time proceed continuation therapy . Patients whose disease response stable , mixed worse receive additional therapy : 1 . Prednisone 3 divided dos mouth 3 day every week , week 7-12 . 2 . Vinblastine IV one day week 6 week . - If disease go well additional therapy continuation begin . Continuation Therapy 1 . Prednisone 3 dos daily day 1-5 every 3 week end month 6 12 start therapy , randomize . 2 . Vinblastine IV day 1 every 3 week end month 6 12 start therapy , randomize . Therapy `` SPECIAL SITE '' ( Multi-focal Bone Involvement ) Patients : Treatment consist initial treatment 6 week continuation treatment . A second course give patient progressive disease . The overall therapy time period 6 month . Initial Therapy 4 . Prednisone give mouth three time day daily four-week course , gradually decrease 2 week . 5 . Vinblastine give IV ( vein ) one day week 6 week . 6 . Patients evidence active disease time proceed continuation therapy . Patients whose disease response stable , mixed worse receive additional therapy : 3 . Prednisone 3 divided dos day 1-3 weekly week 7-12 . 4 . Vinblastine IV one day week 6 week . - If disease go well additional therapy continuation begin . Continuation Therapy 3 . Prednisone 3 dos daily day 1-5 every 3 week end month 6 . 4 . Vinblastine IV day 1 every 3 week end month 6 . Group 1 `` RISK '' patient : The primary aim study compare therapeutic efficacy control arm A ( PDN+VBL ) experimental arm B ( PDN+VBL+MTX ) . The primary endpoint proportion non-responder risk organs initial treatment . Non-response initial therapy define : â€¢ death within 12 week initial treatment - progression ( bad ) risk organ week 6 - lack response ( =intermediate response progression ) risk organ week 12 compare status disease week 6 . If null hypothesis true , two randomize treatment arm equally effective term non-response . If alternative hypothesis true , difference two randomized arm term efficacy . Group 2 `` LOW RISK '' patient : The primary aim study compare reactivation free survival rate initial responder week 6 continuation treatment 6 month ( Arm LR 6 ) versus 12 month ( Arm LR 12 ) patient without disease reactivation within first 6 month . If null hypothesis true , reactivation rate randomize arm equal . If alternative hypothesis true , difference two arm term reactivation frequency . Therapy `` RISK '' Patients : Treatment A consist : 7 . Initial Therapy 8 . Prednisone give mouth three time day daily four-week course , gradually decrease 2 week . 9 . Vinblastine give IV ( vein ) one day week 6 week . 10 . Patients evidence active disease time proceed continuation therapy . Patients whose disease improve unchanged receive additional therapy : 5 . Prednisone 3 divided dos mouth 3 day every week , week 7-12 . 6 . Vinblastine IV one day week 6 week . ** If disease go well additional therapy continuation begin . Continuation Therapy : 5 . 6-MP mouth daily end month 12 . 6 . Prednisone 3 dos daily day 1-5 every 3 week end month 12 . 7 . Vinblastine IV day 1 every 3 week end month 12 . ** Those patient whose disease n't respond initial therapy 12th week come study proceed research program . Treatment B consist : 1 . Initial Therapy 2 . Prednisone give mouth three time day daily four-week course gradually decrease 2 week . 3 . Vinblastine give IV one day week 6 week . 4 . Methotrexate give 24 hour IV infusion day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , follow leucovorin . 5 . Leucovorin drug give help body remove methotrexate decrease possible side effect . ( This sometimes call `` leukovorin rescue '' . The drug give mouth . ) - Patients evidence active disease time proceed continuation therapy . Patients whose disease improve unchanged receive additional therapy : 1 . Prednisone 3 divided dos , day 1-3 weekly week 7-12 . 2 . Vinblastine IV one day week 6 week . 3 . Methotrexate give 24 hour IV infusion day 1 week 7 , 9 , 11 , follow leucovorin . - If disease go well additional therapy continuation begin . Continuation Therapy : 1 . 6-MP mouth daily end month 12 . 2 . Prednisone 3 dos daily day 1-5 every 3 week end month 12 . 3 . Vinblastine IV day 1 every 3 week end month 12 . 4 . Methotrexate mouth weekly end month 12 . Those patient whose disease n't respond initial research program 12th week come research study proceed another research program .</detailed_description>
