	<detailed_description>Crohn ’ disease ( CD ) chronic intestinal disorder unknown etiology may involve part gastrointestinal tract . The small bowel involve 70 % CD patient . Undernutrition express low body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 18.5 kg/m² , common presentation report 65–75 % patient . Possible pathogenic mechanism include inadequate dietary intake , increase energy expenditure , nutrient malabsorption intestinal loss . We study recently three important component energy balance underweight crohn ’ patient find nutrient malabsorption may play role . Although majority crohn 's disease patient undernourished , surprisingly obese symptom seem severe ; Blain A et al . report recently obesity CD associate frequent anoperineal complication mark disease activity . Hass J et al find overweight CD patient require early surgical intervention perhaps aggressive medical therapy . Notwithstanding , characteristic CD possible underlying pathophysiological mechanism obese patient study yet . Mesenteric hypertrophy fat commonly call “ creeping fat common feature crohn 's disease report correlate ulceration , stricture formation transmural inflammation . It matter debate whether development creep fat causative secondary phenomenon , increase body evidence suggest mesenteric adipose tissue play active role pathogenesis creep fat mesenteric inflammation pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory adipocytokines . Recently recognition adipose tissue passive connective tissue merely store fat activeendocrine organ participate numerous physiological pathophysiological process variety secretory product designate adipocytokines regulate metabolic process endocrine , paracrine autocrine manner Moreover , Obesity increasingly recognize risk factor number gastrointestinal condition well characterize chronic , systemic low-grade state inflammation per se . Biomarkers inflammation , leukocyte count , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , C-reactive protein , increase obesity relate insulin resistance metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
