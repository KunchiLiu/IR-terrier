	<brief_summary>Objectives : 1 . To assess tolerability perform optical coherence tomography and/or optical spectroscopy patient acute oral mucositis . 2 . To determine feasibility obtain optical coherence tomography image and/or fluorescence excitation emission matrix normal affected site patient acute oral mucositis . 3 . To compare optical data obtain optical coherence tomography and/or spectroscopy clinical appearance score oral mucositis lesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) work similarly ultrasound us infrared light wave rather sound wave create high-resolution picture . This tool approve Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) , use routinely standard diagnosis eye condition , use look inside mouth tissue change . For OCT procedure , small probe , size pencil eraser , gently place line mouth light shone probe create picture tissue . The probe place 1-2 abnormal-looking area 1 normal-looking area inside mouth . If abnormal-looking area , researcher place probe make picture area inside cheek side tongue , since area often affect chemotherapy radiation therapy . In fluorescence spectroscopy ( FS ) , small beam light , shin small probe onto line mouth . A small amount light emit tissue form fluorescence , similar `` glow dark '' toy . This light see eye , detect probe record computer . For FS procedure , small probe , size pencil eraser , gently place line mouth light shone probe . The probe collect fluorescence light signal record computer . The probe place 1-2 abnormal-looking area 1 normal-looking area inside mouth . If abnormal-looking area , researcher place probe make picture area inside cheek side tongue , since area often affect chemotherapy radiation therapy . If agree take part study , mouth examine treatment begin , week . Every week , also ask much pain scale 1-10 . Photographs take inside mouth standard camera . You identify photograph . You ask return week finish radiation treatment exams repeat . Most radiation treatment last 6-8 week . This investigational study . About 18 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
