	<brief_summary>This First Time Human Study ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics rest motor threshold ( rMT ) single dos GSK drug healthy volunteers.This 2 part 2 centre study.Part 1 double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , single oral dose , dose-rising , cross-over study healthy male female ( non-child bearing potential ) volunteers.Subjects randomize cohort 10 subject cohort recruit pre-defined safety PK stop limit reached.Each subject receive placebo 4 ascending dos GSK drug randomize sequence 5 separate study occasions.Each dose session take place 2 day least one subject placebo day . There one subject new active dose first day.Part 2 randomise , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , cross-over study investigate effect single dos GSK drug lamotrigine rest motor threshold healthy male subject . Subjects attend unit maximum 4 separate occasions.During session subject receive 4 TMS measurement single dos either GSK drug , lamotrigine placebo , randomise manner.Up two dos GSK drug investigate .</brief_summary>
