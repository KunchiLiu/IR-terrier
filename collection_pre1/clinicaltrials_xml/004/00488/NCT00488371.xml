	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Streptococcus Pneumoniae Nasopharyngeal Carriage Rate Children Receiving Prevnar®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Under Social Welfare Vaccination Program , Taipei City Government vaccinate approximately 5,000 child reside city Taipei 2 5 year age month November 2006 April 2007 one dose PCV7 . To gather baseline data serotype distribution antibiotic resistance nasopharyngeal ( NP ) carriage isolate population measure vaccine impact NP carriage , Taipei city government require evaluation vaccination program detection Streptococcus pneumoniae NP carriage rate pre post vaccination convenience sample approximately 1000 child . This number comply Taipei city government request inclusion 250 child . Streptococcus pneumoniae major cause bacterial otitis medium , pneumonia , sepsis , bacteraemia , meningitis among infant worldwide . The main reservoir pneumococcus human nasopharynx . The mean age first acquisition 6 month carriage rate peak preschool age group . The organisms pilli surface assist adhere nasopharyngeal mucosal receptor . Streptococcus pneumoniae part normal flora colonize individual , organism ability cause disease invade neighbor tissue , potentially spread bloodstream site , cause invasive pneumococcal disease , bacteremia , sepsis meningitis . The rate NP carriage Streptococcus pneumoniae Taiwan ( 1998-99 ) estimate 19.9 % overall child 1-14 year 27.1 % 2-5 year . A recent study Lauderdale et al . find carriage rate 41 % child attend kindergarten program Taiwan 5 year old diagnose streptococcus meningitis . Prevnar® show high degree efficacy prevention invasive pneumococcal disease child . In addition , PCV7 show decrease NP carriage serotypes include vaccine ( VST ) . Since NP carriage prerequisite transmission Streptococcus pneumoniae , decrease NP carriage VSTs child result decreased transmission contact indirect effect ( herd effect ) invasive pneumococcal disease . Since majority antibiotic resistant strain VST , PCV7 immunization decrease antibiotic resistance invasive pneumococcal disease immunized contact . However , PCV7 vaccination overall pneumococcal NP carriage rate change , since Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes include vaccine ( NVST ) replace VSTs . Although nasopharynx almost complete replacement NVST , serotypes may less ability cause invasive disease , since disease NVST observe much low magnitude disease prior PCV7 vaccination . Thus , expect outcome successful PCV7 vaccination program NP carriage decrease carriage VST increase NVST thus , stable overall Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage rate .</detailed_description>
