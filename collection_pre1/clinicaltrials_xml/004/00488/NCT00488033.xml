	<brief_title>Screening For Asymptomatic Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease Among High-Risk Diabetic Patients Using CT Angiography , Following Core 64</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management Patients Randomized Control Arm : Subjects randomize control arm continue follow primary care physician recommendation follow standard guideline management diabetic patient . Management Patients Randomized Asymptomatic Screening Arm : Subjects randomize Asymptomatic Screening arm undergo initial CT screen follow fashion : - Subjects serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl ( men ) &lt; 1.8 mg/dL ( woman ) screen use multi-slice CT angiography contrast . - Those serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl ( men ) &gt; 1.8 mg/dL ( woman ) screen without contrast obtain coronary calcium score . Further cardiac screening determine base result . Subjects Receiving Multi-Slice CT Angiography ( serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl ( men ) &lt; 1.8 mg/dL ( woman ) ) : Subjects severe stenosis proceed coronary angiography revascularization need . Subjects moderate stenosis refer adenosine stress cardiac MRI . If ischemia detect , also refer coronary angiography . Subjects either mild stenosis normal coronary artery receive image study . Subjects Undergoing CT Evaluation Coronary Calcium Scoring ( serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl ( men ) &gt; 1.8 mg/dL ( woman ) : Subjects coronary calcium score &gt; 100 &gt; 75th percentile refer adenosine stress cardiac MRI . If ischemia detect , refer coronary angiography . Subjects coronary calcium score = 0-10 11-100 &lt; 75th percentile receive image study . Medical Management ( Only patient randomize Asymptomatic Screening Arm ) : In addition image study potential coronary revascularization procedure perform describe , subject place one two medical regimen : - Standard Appropriate DM Care - Aggressive Risk Factor Reduction Care . Standard Appropriate DM Care : Subjects assign form medical care manage primary physician . This type care consist target goal propose Intermountain Healthcare patient diabetes . These include follow three target : HgA1C &lt; 7.0 % , LDL cholesterol &lt; 100 mg/dL Systolic BP &lt; 130 mm Hg . Subjects assign Standard Care include control subject , well screen subject either normal CT angiogram coronary calcium score = 0-10 . Aggressive Risk Factor Reduction Care : Subjects assign form medical care , addition standard medical care provide primary physician , also manage primary physician , receive aggressive risk factor reduction management accord set guideline give primary physician . This aggressive management strategy , design address increase medical risk among asymptomatic diabetic detect vascular disease , consist aggressive glucose lipid target Standard Care protocols specific medication algorithm design accomplish aggressive target . Follow-Up After enrollment protocol , subject follow minimum one year . Follow-up occur telephone six-month interval . Outcomes ascertain directly question patient review medical record . All primary outcome adjudicate independent event committee . Statistical Analysis Both intention-to-treat analysis protocol analysis perform . The intention-to-treat analysis primary analysis define randomized scan versus randomize control regardless actually happen . The protocol analysis define actually get protocol scan versus get scan . Those get scan include randomize control arm . If go outside study get scan anyway , consider clinical indication still non-protocol scan group . For randomized get scan never , evaluation baseline characteristic make differ actually get scan randomize control , include n't get scan group .</detailed_description>
