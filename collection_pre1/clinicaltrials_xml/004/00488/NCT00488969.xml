Avinza approve Food Drug Administration treatment pain , know effective Avinza reduce SCI-related pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Controlled-Release Morphine Chronic Neuropathic Pain After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathic pain occur result damage neural tissue either peripheral central nervous system . Three type neuropathic pain SCI especially difficult treat : level central pain ( ALCP ) , level radicular pain ( ALRP ) , level central pain ( BLCP ) . Various analgesic medication distinct mechanism sit action currently use clinical practice treatment neuropathic pain SCI , include antidepressant , anticonvulsant , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , opioids . These analgesic medication , evaluate animal model SCI pain treatment neuropathic pain state , show modest pain reduce effect . This modest effect see clinically majority person SCI receive drug continue experience pain , severe disable one third case . This study propose examine efficacy oral modify release morphine reduce pain person neuropathic pain SCI adequately respond oral pharmacologic , psychologic , physical intervention . Only subject failed prior pain treatment regime enrol . Failure pain regimen define presence pain spite medication ( ) pain treatment , biofeedback psychological physical therapy intervention prescribe physician . The following hypothesis test : morphine , add non-opioid medication , effective placebo reduce pain increase activity subjective well-being , person ALCP , ALRP BLCP . In order test hypothesis , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled , two period cross-over trial propose , subject ALCP , ALRP , BLCP receive daily placebo modify release morphine closely monitor assess : ( 1 ) adverse effect , ( 2 ) quality intensity pain , ( 3 ) intensity allodynia hyperalgesia , ( 4 ) activity level well-being . All subject whether assign placebo active drug able continue previously prescribe non-prescribed ( over-the-counter ) non-opioid medication take regular basis , without dose change , least three week prior study entry . These medication may include limited analgesic : acetaminophen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ; local anesthetics- topical patch lidocaine patch otherwise ; adjuvant pain medication anti-depressant anticonvulsant class . Subjects allowed take opioid medication , include non-opioid-opioid combination analgesic , study drug duration study .</detailed_description>
