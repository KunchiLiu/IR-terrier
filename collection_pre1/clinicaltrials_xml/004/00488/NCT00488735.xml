	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Non-specific back neck pain ( BNP ) dominate sick-listing . A program cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation subacute chronic BNP compare , 18-month follow-up , traditional primary care concern sick-listing health-care visit . METHODS After stratification age ( 44 ( year ) younger/45 old ) subacute/chronic BNP ( = full-time sick-listed 43-84/85-730 day respectively ) , 125 primary-care patient randomize rehabilitation center continue health-center care . Outcome measure Return-to-work ( =the proportion regain work ability least 30 consecutive day ) , proportion Work ability different time point , Total sick-listing ( expressed whole day ) total number Visits ( physician , physiotherapist etc . ) 1-18 month correspond six-month period .

	<detailed_description>Numbers within parenthesis refers place order citation list within bracket link list . B A C K G R O U N D In Sweden , industrial world , unspecific back neck pain ( BNP ) dominate sick-listing ( 1 ) . Primary care appropriate source treatment patient BNP ( 2 ) . However , Swedish traditional primary care lack capacity assignment [ 1 ] . While number practice physician line OECD standard , Sweden , relatively see , physician within primary care . Our overall aim compare program cognitive-behavioral-rehabilitation rehabilitation center patient subacute chronic BNP traditional primary care . The specific aim study answer question : Will outcome , 18-month follow-up , differ concern sick-listing number health-care visit ? M E T H O D S PARTICIPANTS : One-hundred-and-twenty-five patient recruit 42 family doctor 12 health center . INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : See INTERVENTIONS : Cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation : The medical , biomechanical psychosocial obstacle work map . A physiotherapist let patient grade activity ( 3 ) . A behaviorist offer cognitive-behavioral therapy . A health adviser teach apply relaxation ( 4 ) . A physician prescribed medicine need . Then individual management replace team conference . A rehabilitation plan draw . The patient gradually return work . The end rehabilitation come final aim achieve clear work ability would attain . Participation rehabilitation group exclude patient seek care also . Traditional primary care : The hub Swedish primary care health centre . Besides family doctor , staff consist , among others , physiotherapist social worker . In total , health center study engage 84 family doctor serve population 148 000 individual , i.e . slightly less 0.6 , compare OECD-average 0.8 , family doctors/1000 population [ 2 ] . Participation health-center group exclude patient turn rehabilitation center health-care , example , orthopedist consultation . DATA COLLECTION : Sick-listing data provide Stockholm County Social Insurance Agency . Data treatment rehabilitation center collect medical journal . As rest , health-care data obtain follow-up form . OUTCOME MEASURES : See . POWER CALCULATION : It originate retrospective preliminary study 172 patient rehabilitation centre forecast probability ever regain work ability patient full-time sick-listing back pain traditional care ( 5 ) . The proportion patient degree work ability end rehabilitation 76 % , patient subacute chronic BNP , 89 % 73 % respectively . The average probability regain work ability case continue management within traditional care calculate one 172 patient accord period sick-listing start rehabilitation average 49 % compare 76 % really regained work ability . The small difference wish demonstrate 22 % . With significance level .05 power 80 % 154 patient include , allow certain dropout , 170 patient . PREMATURE STOP OF RECRUITMENT : The recruitment discontinue January 2004 125 patient . The reason April 2004 large back-rehabilitation centre start neighbor municipality . We presume many planned future patient health-center group would refer centre get management could longer defined traditional primary care . INCLUSION PROCEDURE : A patient fulfil criterion agree participate interview telephone research assistant . The patient still qualify saw assistant health center go start form . Then assistant carry 10-test package , include lift test . The reliability test procedure confirm separate study ( 6 ) . Then randomization make stratification age 44 young 45 old , subacute BNP chronic BNP , i.e . full-time sick list 43-84 85-730 day respectively . The stratification make result preliminary study . Randomization envelop use . The patient rehabilitation group start program centre within one week . The patient health-center group continue health-centers ( = traditional primary care ) . FOLLOW-UP : Six , 12 18 month inclusion , patient send follow-up form . ANALYSES AND STATISTICS : A p-value &lt; .05 consider statistically significant . For interval data use t-test , ordinal data Wilcoxon rank-sum test proportion z-test . Total sick-listing well Visits pre- post-inclusion six-months period compare mixed-linear model ( 7 ) .</detailed_description>
