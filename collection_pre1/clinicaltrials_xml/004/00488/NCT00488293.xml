Existing data indicate teledermatology reliable accurate method diagnose skin disease . Research Objectives - The purpose study compare store forward teledermatology conventional clinic-based dermatology consultation process . Our primary objective determine whether mean change patient quality life , rat composite score subscale score skin-specific quality life index ( Skindex-16 ) , differ time randomization 9 month patient evaluate store forward teledermatology compare conventional consult method . Secondary objective include ( ) assess quality life time randomization 3 month , ( b ) assessing time initial definitive evaluation patient use modality , ( c ) evaluate clinical course use serial digital imaging , ( ) comparing cost cost-effectiveness store forward teledermatology conventional consult method . Project Methods - The study parallel-group , superiority , randomize clinical trial compare store forward teledermatology conventional clinic-based consult process . Patients randomize use simple randomization scheme stratify site one two consult modality . Eligible patient include referred remote sit primary care medical center-based site dermatology service . Skindex-16 administered baseline , 3 month , 9 month . Time initial definitive evaluation , calculate base need time clinic-based visit measure group . Using digital image , clinical course assess 5 point scale expert panel three dermatologist . Categories include resolve , improve , unchanged clinically relevant , unchanged clinically relevant , bad . Health care utility measure use time trade-off data Health Utilities Index Mark 2 ( HUI2 ) . We compare cost teledermatology conventional consult method estimate average cost per patient 9 month study period . Effectiveness assess use health care utility time initial definitive evaluation .
