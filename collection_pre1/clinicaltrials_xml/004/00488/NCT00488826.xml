	<detailed_description>This study combination Phase I Phase III study design . The Phase I portion open-label , control study evaluate safety 7vPnC healthy Chinese infant . The Phase III portion open-label , control , randomize study evaluate safety immunogenicity 7vPnC healthy Chinese infant . Both phase include Primary Series include primary 3 dos 7vPnC and/or DTaP 3 , 4 , 5 month age ; Booster Dose include 4th dose 7vPnC 12-15 month age . A total 822 healthy Chinese infant enrol . The study conduct 2 phase : Phase I Phase III . Phase I : 22 healthy infant enrol first receive dose 7vPnC least 7 day prior receive DTaP follow safety 30 day post immunization . If adverse event specific concern consider , opinion principal investigator , relate study vaccine ( include , though limited , infectious allergic reaction describe China Immunization Handbook ) within 4 day first dose immunization serious adverse event possibly , probably definitely relate study vaccine within 30 day first dose immunization , Phase III initiate infant Phase I proceed next dose Primary Series . If event occur , medical review conduct investigator Sponsor decide study proceed . Phase III : 800 infant enrol randomize one 3 group accord administration regimen . Group 1 : 300 infant receive primary 3 dos 7vPnC separately 3 , 4 5 month age . Group 2 : 300 infant receive primary 3 dos 7vPnC concurrently DTaP 3 , 4 5 month age . Group 3 : 200 infant receive DTaP 3 , 4 5 month age . The injection site leave upper arm deltoid 7vPnC right upper arm deltoid DTaP . Safety Evaluation : Each infant initial physical examination history obtain enrollment visit brief physical evaluation subsequent visit . Following immunization , subject observe clinic 30 minute evaluate sign symptom anaphylaxis reaction injection site . The parent legal guardian require take infant 's axillary temperature even immunization 3 consecutive evening follow immunization . In addition , parent suspect infant may fever time four day follow immunization , temperature take record . Thermometers axillary temperature use diary card supply Wyeth distribution parent . The parent legal guardian subject instruct complete diary card 4 day [ day immunization ( day 0 ) next 3 day ] follow immunization . Information collect include : subject 's axillary temperature , local reaction 7vPnC injection site ( All subject Phase I study Group 1 Group 2 Phase III ) DTaP injection site ( Group 2 Group 3 Phase III ) ( tenderness , presence size erythema induration/swelling ) systemic reaction ( disrupt sleep , drowsiness , decrease appetite , irritability , vomit , diarrhea rash limit injection site ) occur day 0-3 . The subject return clinic visit home day immunization ( Day 1 ) local systemic reaction observation study personnel . The parent legal guardian contact telephone home visit 2 3 day post-immunization collect information local systemic event information record source data sheet study personnel . On , , fourth day immunization , study personnel collect diary card . The data diary card reconcile data source data sheet . If discrepancy , clarify parent record . At visit next immunization , interim medical history since Day 4 post last immunization review parent/legal guardian . If adverse event , collect record case report form . The primary source data adverse event parent legal guardian subject , well medical record health care provider seek result adverse event . The parent/legal guardian instruct contact investigator immediately serious adverse event . Assessment Immunogenicity : Up 3ml venous blood collect 55 infant Group 1 , 55 infant Group 2 55 infant Group 3 Phase III , immediately prior first dose 30-40 day 3rd dose assess immunogenicity . Booster Dose : All infant Phase I Group 1 Group 2 Phase III receive booster dose 7vPnC 12-15 month age . Local/systemic reaction observe way primary dose . Assessment Immunogenicity : Up 3ml venous blood collect 55 infant Group 1 55 infant Group 2 Primary Series Phase III , immediately prior forth dose 30-40 day 4th dose assess immunogenicity . The statistical analysis two phase conduct separately . The statistical analysis primary series plan subject receive 1st , 2nd 3rd dose 7vPnC 3 dos DTaP 3 dos DTaP alone 30-day safety follow-up period terminate . The analysis booster dose plan subject receive 4th dose 7vPnC 30-day safety follow-up period terminate .</detailed_description>
