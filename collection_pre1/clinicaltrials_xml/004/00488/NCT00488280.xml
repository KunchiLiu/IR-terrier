	<brief_title>Restoring Walking Non-ambulatory Children With Severe Chronic Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) ( Kids STEP Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locomotor training ( LT ) activity-based therapy promote plasticity recovery walking . It base animal study investigate walk recovery spinal cord injury nervous system 's control walking . Normal walk achieve interaction multiple level neural axis ( cortex , brain stem , spinal cord ) . However , basic rhythmic walking pattern generate central pattern generator ( CPGs ) locate within spinal cord . Investigations central pattern generator indicate sensory input specific task walk enhance fire spinal neuronal center . Thus , LT intensive walk program design provide sensory input spinal cord neural output spinal CPGs maximize . In addition , LT use treadmill harness provide partial body weight support enable person injury repetitively practice walk safe , enable environment . Children enrol study ( medical clearance consent participate ) undergo extensive test complete 12 week locomotor training . Testing examine child 's neurologic functional status . Tests examine functional status include : ASIA evaluation sensory motor function , gait analysis , comprehensive strength test , assessment skill cycling , stepping , kick . Tests examine child 's neurologic injury include : MRI , Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) , reflex testing . Locomotor training conduct daily ( 5 days/ week ) total 60 session 12 week . During train child work closely therapist , researcher , trainer practice walk skill treadmill over-ground .</detailed_description>
