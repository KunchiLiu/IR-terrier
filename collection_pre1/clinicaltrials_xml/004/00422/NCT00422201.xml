	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether drug mifepristone improve symptom Cushing 's syndrome people ectopic adrenal corticotrophin hormone ( ACTH ) secretion . Cushing 's syndrome occur adrenal gland produce much cortisol , hormone help regulate body 's use salt food . Excessive cortisol usually result much ACTH , hormone cause adrenal gland make cortisol . The extra ACTH make either tumor pituitary gland ( call Cushing 's disease ) tumor somewhere else ( call ectopic ACTH secretion ) . Mifepristone block action cortisol body . The drug use safely treat people Cushing 's syndrome patient certain kind cancer , gynecological disease psychiatric disorder . People 18 85 year age Cushing 's syndrome cause EXCESS ACTH secretion may eligible study . Candidates admit hospital evaluation confirm Cushing 's syndrome determine cause . The evaluation include blood urine test , image test , dexamethasone corticotropin-releasing hormone test inferior petrosal sinus sample . Patients determine Cushing 's syndrome due ECTOPIC ACTH secretion undergo image study ( CT , MRI nuclear medicine scan ) begin mifepristone therapy . Participants remain hospital follow test procedure : - Physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood urine test - Completion medical questionnaire - DEXA scan determine bone mineral density body composition - Glucose tolerance test - Urine pregnancy test ultrasound measure uterine lining thickness ( woman ) Patients take mifepristone mouth 3 time day . The dose increase every week symptom improve high dosage allow reach . Patients may remain hospital part dose-finding part study . During period ( usually 2 4 week ) , blood pressure , glucose tolerance blood chemistry measure EKG urinalysis do every 5 14 day . When mifepristone dose stable patient remain dose least 2 week re-evaluated . Patients return hospital evaluation every 3 month . Those well drug may continue take 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Between 10 % 20 % patient hypercortisolism ( Cushing 's Syndrome ) tumoral ectopic production adrenocorticotropin hormone ( ACTH ) cause cortisol excess . If ectopic tumor find surgery do , treatment option include medicine reduce cortisol production bilateral adrenalectomy . The available medication reduce cortisol production important adverse effect effective patient adrenalectomy lead lifelong requirement medical hormone replacement . Thus , additional treatment option would welcome . This study evaluate potential new medication treatment patient ; mifepristone block effect cortisol rather decrease production . The purpose study see whether agent improve diabetes symptoms Cushing 's syndrome subject ectopic ACTH secretion . Another purpose evaluate adverse effect drug . Patients presume ectopic ACTH secretion diabetes take mifepristone 600 mg daily mouth , effect diabetes symptom Cushing 's syndrome measure . Subjects return hospital 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month start mifepristione evaluation diabetes symptom . The agent available 12 month patient effective . Patients take mifepristone mouth 3 time day . Each dose contain 200 mg . Patients may remain hospital part initial safety study , every two week eight week . During period blood pressure , glucose tolerance blood chemistry measure EKG urinalysis do every two week . The mifepristone dose decrease stopped adverse effect . When mifepristone dose stable eight week , patient re-evaluated . Patients return hospital evaluation one month later every 3 month . Those well drug may continue take 12 month .</detailed_description>
