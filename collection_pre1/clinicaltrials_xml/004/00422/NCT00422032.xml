	<brief_title>2 Arm Study Clofarabine IV MDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clofarabine new chemotherapy drug design interfere growth development cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group ( Groups A B ) . Participants Group A receive low dose clofarabine . Participants Group B receive high dose clofarabine . At first , equal chance assign either group . However , experience increase information become available , chance assign group show effectiveness increase . You study doctor know group assign . Participants receive clofarabine 1-hour infusion vein day 5 day row . This repeat every 4 8 week . Each 4-8 week period consider 1 cycle treatment . For participant group , cycle therapy , receive next cycle chemotherapy blood count recover possible side effect go away ( around 4 8 week ) . You must stay Houston first treatment cycle ( 4 8 week ) require return Houston receive additional cycle chemotherapy ( 6 day cycle ) . Before every treatment cycle , doctor perform physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . You ask level daily activity feel . You blood sample ( 1-2 teaspoon ) collect routine lab test 1-2 time week first cycle , every 2-4 week therapy . Repeat bone marrow sample collect every 1-3 cycle . However , complete study third cycle , bone marrow may take . You may choose check-up visit blood test local doctor . If show response experience severe side effect , receive total 12 cycle therapy . During cycle , clofarabine give way first cycle . However , dose clofarabine may lower late cycle decrease risk side effect may occur previous cycle . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . This investigational study . Clofarabine approve FDA treatment pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Its use study experimental . Up 60 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
