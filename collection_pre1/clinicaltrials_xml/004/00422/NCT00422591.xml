	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find standard chemotherapy give idarubicin Cytarabine ( ara-C ) help control AML . Objectives : To determine complete response ( CR ) rate , event-free survival ( EFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) receive standard combination chemotherapy Idarubicin cytarabine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Idarubicin Cytarabine Treatment Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ara-C idarubicin design interfere DNA 's ( genetic material cell ) ability repair , cause cancer cell die . If find eligible take part study , receive treatment idarubicin ara-C 8 cycle . One cycle last 4-5 week . Cycles 1 2 call induction therapy , use help induce ( cause ) remission . Cycles 3 8 call consolidation therapy , type high-dose chemotherapy often give second phase cancer treatment . After Cycle 1 , brief rest period day , move Cycle 2 . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive cytarabine vein continuous infusion 4 day . It 3 day age 60 old . On Days 1-3 Cycle 1 , receive idarubicin vein 1 hour day . The dose study drug receive may change help manage side effect ( nausea diarrhea ) may experience . Medications ( give mouth vein ) , Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) , may give treatment help decrease risk side effect . The study doctor specify medication . You blood draw ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test week treatment . Starting Days 21-28 , bone marrow collect every 1-2 week check status disease . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) also draw least twice week cycle therapy ( begin 4-6 week start treatment cycle ) check blood count . Cycle 2 begin blood count recover . If end Cycle 1 achieve remission ( disease decrease ) , may receive Cycle 2 , similar Cycle 1 . If disease respond treatment Cycle 2 ( completion induction therapy ) , receive 6 cycle therapy . These cycle call consolidation therapy . Consolidation therapy type high-dose chemotherapy often give second phase treat cancer . For consolidation therapy , receive ara-C continuous infusion 3 day start Day 1 Cycle 3 . On Days 1 2 Cycles 3 4 , receive idarubicin vein 1 hour . Your blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw least twice week cycle check blood count . Cycle 3 begin blood count recover . After completion consolidation therapy , may receive call maintenance therapy . Maintenance therapy start completion consolidation therapy . Maintenance therapy often give help keep cancer remission . It treatment give help original treatment keep working . You tell maintenance therapy well drug drug schedule . During consolidation and/or maintenance therapy , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test every 1-2 week . You bone marrow collect every 3-6 month check status disease . You may treatment study 8 cycle ( induction consolidation therapy ) ( maintenance therapy ) , depend disease response study drug . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study , study doctor discus treatment option . Once participation study , followed-up phone call study doctor study nurse check experienced intolerable side effect . The call last 10-15 minute . This investigational study . Idarubicin ara-C FDA approve commercially available . Up 200 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
