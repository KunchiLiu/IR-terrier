	<brief_summary>The primary objective PRE-COMBAT trial : To establish safety effectiveness coronary stenting sirolimus-eluting balloon expandable stent ( Cordis Johnson &amp; Johnson , Warren , New Jersey ) compare bypass surgery treatment unprotected LMCA stenosis . The alternative hypothesis experimental strategy ( coronary stenting sirolimus-eluting stent ) inferior standard strategy ( bypass surgery ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bypass Surgery Versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite bypass surgery consider standard strategy treatment unprotected leave main coronary artery ( LMCA ) lesion , several study demonstrate percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) unprotected LMCA feasible appear alternative strategy select patient . However , safety efficacy PCI patient unprotected LMCA stenosis still matter debate . Previous study demonstrate safety feasibility unprotected LMCA intervention use bare metal stent ( BMS ) . There favorable initial outcome LMCA intervention use BMS low-risk patient . However , in-stent restenosis BMS implantation emerge interference widely perform PCI unprotected LMCA lesion important reason selection bypass surgery first choice treat LMCA stenosis . In-stent restenosis patient influence long-term survival , also make repeat intervention complex . Despite endeavor decrease in-stent restenosis LMCA intervention use BMS , aggressive debulking atherectomy , restenosis rate still remain 20-30 % . The sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) ( Cypher , Cordis , Johnson &amp; Johnson Corp , Miami , Florida ) markedly decrease in-stent restenosis elective patient relatively simple coronary lesion . In real-world practice use SES , patient undergoing SES implantation treat less restrictive interventional approach . However , result promise similar randomize controlled trial . These finding warrant new study compare efficacy SES complex lesion subset include LMCA disease coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) .</detailed_description>

The patient know hypersensitivity contraindication follow medication : Heparin Aspirin Both Clopidogrel TIclopidine Sirolimus , paclitaxel , ABT 578 Stainless steel and/or Contrast medium ( patient document sensitivity contrast effectively premedicated steroid diphenhydramine [ e.g . rash ] may enrol . Patients true anaphylaxis prior contrast medium , however , enrol ) . Systemic ( intravenous ) Sirolimus , paclitaxel ABT578 use within 12 month .

History bleeding diathesis know coagulopathy ( include heparininduced thrombocytopenia ) , refuse blood transfusion . Current known current platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hgb &lt; 10 g/dL . An elective surgical procedure plan would necessitate interruption thienopyridines first 1 year post enrollment . Noncardiac comorbid condition present life expectancy &lt; 1 year may result protocol noncompliance ( per site investigator 's medical judgment ) .
