	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) determine whether activity brain someone win something affect part brain control movement . Studies show brain release signal mark reward certain behavior , like activity brain generates animal receives food drink perform certain action . This study look way detect kind signal human . Healthy volunteer 18 60 year age eligible study . Participants undergo TMS two experiment slot machine stimulation key sequence ( see ) . For TMS , wire coil hold subject scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm leg , may pull sensation skin coil . The effect TMS muscle detect small metal disk electrode tap onto skin arm leg . The stimulation strength need activate hand muscle determine begin experiment . To , subject sits arm hand relaxed . Magnetic pulse vary strength apply order find right strength . Also , series 45 pair magnetic pulse administer close produce one movement . Measurements movement generate serve baseline comparison movement generate experiment . Slot Machine Simulation Subjects play computer game similar slot machine . They press button start game watch three barrel machine spin place . Subjects win $ 0.25 , $ 1or $ 5 three barrel match stop spinning . If three barrel match , subject win money , except rare instance , award money even three barrel match . In one trial experiment , subject receive transcranial magnetic stimulation see second barrel stop spinning . In another trial , receive stimulation third barrel stop spin . Key Sequence Subjects see letter computer screen press combination three keyboard key G , H , J . If press key right order time limit , win $ 1 . At point , letter display change , subject must guess new combination earn money . Each letter correspond combination key press . A moment subject see whether press key right order , receive TMS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectvie : The role mesencephalic dopamine neuron reward process establish primate use electrophysiological technique human use functional neuroimaging . Their role think dual : ) show sustained activity expectation future reward ii ) phasic response reward . Animal data indicate neuron , locate midbrain area A8-10 , behave single functional unit activate . They rich projection prefrontal motor cortex synapse interneurons cortical pyramidal cell , produce primarily inhibition . Though function fully understood , projection clearly play important role motivation learn . Since electrophysiological technique available detect dopaminergic inhibitory activity human prefrontal cortex , objective develop paradigm detect reward relate signal primary motor cortex , transcranial magnetic stimulation use measure brief event . Study Population : The population study healthy volunteer age 18-60 , without significant medical history , contraindication TMS history addictive behavior . Design : Our hypothesis dopamine reward-related signal alter level evocable inhibition primary motor cortex . Using behavioral paradigm deliver intermittent reward , aim demonstrate difference amount cortical inhibition , ) reward expect compare reward expect ii ) reward compare unrewarded trial iii ) reward follow variable effortful response , iv ) uncertainty whether reward administer . If unable produce signal motor cortex simple paradigm , look reward-related change inhibition reward behavior associative learning motor sequence . We control effect variation attention relate experimental task , specific reward , similar behavioral paradigm manipulates attention expectation . Outcome Measures : The outcome measure change conditioned/unconditioned MEP reward condition .</detailed_description>
