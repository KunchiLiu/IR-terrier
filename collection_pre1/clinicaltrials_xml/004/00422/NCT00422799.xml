	<brief_title>Combination Bortezomib Rituximab Patients With Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants receive 6 cycle study treatment bortezomib rituximab . Each cycle 28 day long ( 4 week ) . - Participants receive Rituximab intravenously week first fourth cycle . Participants receive bortezomib week three week one week every cycle , total 6 cycle . - During rituximab infusion , participant blood pressure pulse monitor frequently . The rate infusion may decrease depend upon side effect experience . - Blood sample collect first dose follow every cycle . Blood count also perform every week . - Routine physical exam perform evaluation . A PET/CAT scan chest , abdomen pelvis end treatment . This scan required ass response participant disease . - In order learn bortezomib rituximab affect WM , bone marrow biopsy perform . - We anticipate participant complete active therapy period 6 cycle provide benefit therapy serious side effect . The participant follow every three month 2 year office visit laboratory test .</detailed_description>
