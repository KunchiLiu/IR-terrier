	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PROPOSAL AND PROTOCOL TITLE Local anesthesia prostate biopsy : Effects pain control , quality life , surgical intervention . SPECIFIC AIMS Local anesthetic ( 1 % lidocaine ) administer prior transrectal needle biopsy prostate control pain office setting . In study , would determine location injection manage pain best compare patient ? subjective pain response depict visual analog score . In addition , evaluate prostate biopsy anesthetic technique change patient ? quality life determine impact observe surgical dissection . SIGNIFICANCE Transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy prostate gold standard diagnose prostate cancer . We perform approximately 80 procedure per month office setting . This intervention often spark anxiety patient due pain may encounter . In fact , past patient survey show 50-90 % patient suffer significant pain prostate biopsy local anesthesia used1 . Since year 2000 , inject local anesthetic prior biopsy . This allow u obtain average 10 12 sample gland . Overall , patient able tolerate procedure without significant morbidity . The cost office biopsy clinic close $ 1800 , do anesthesia operate room $ 7000 . Patients may need undergo biopsy monitor set do time additional procedure saturation biopsy plan , 30 sample may take . Other patient do anesthesia adamantly refuse office biopsy due anxiety pain associated procedure . Pain subjective response vary patient . Various method anesthesia employ control pain office setting . Our traditional method apply local anesthetic lubricant rectum . Following , use 22 gauge spinal needle ultrasound guidance place 5cc lidocaine junction base prostate seminal vesicle side gland , draw medication distally toward apex . Other group inject anesthetic directly prostate gland right leave side midline . Still , center focus anesthetize apex gland . There consensus location provide best pain relief patient . This knowledge would critical men undergo procedure identify prostate cancer early possible . It procedure do successfully office set allow patient early diagnosis , help contain medical cost avoid operate room . In addition , unknown whether location anesthetic injection cause difference quality life procedure . Specifically , would focus determine change urinary pattern , bowel habit , sexual function . Furthermore , regard patient find cancer would like surgical intervention , plan future study see anesthetic influence ease dissection prostatectomy . PRELIMINARY STUDIES Transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy prostate first describe 19892 . In begin , hypoechoic area palpate nodule target biopsy . Later , elevate serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) become common indication biopsy . The sextant biopsy do sample gland , become apparent many cancer missed3 . More biopsy need , center perform twenty biopsy office set thorough investigation 4-6 . The autonomic nerve caudal root S2 S5 detect pain prostate biopsy . These nerve travel prostatic vascular pedicle locate posterolaterally gland innervate prostate capsule stroma . In 1996 Nash describe technique ease pain procedure7 . His team use transrectal ultrasound place 5cc 1 % lidocaine region prostatic neurovascular pedicle junction base prostate seminal vesicle . This do right leave side prostate , significantly decrease pain procedure . Modifications make injection begin location anesthetic also draw distally toward prostate apex numb pain fiber along entire breadth gland8 . Most center use method obtain office biopsy even use technique perform saturation biopsy office setting5 . Traditionally , also perform anesthetic method clinic . Yet , another study look intraprostatic administration 1 % lidocaine provide anesthesia9 . In analysis , 10cc 1 % lidocaine infiltrate 2 3 site right leave side gland , draw anesthetic base towards apex prostate . This method compare traditional method describe . The intraprostatic method find good analgesic technique . However , even study , apical biopsy continue uncomfortable . This location often prove painful site obtain sample . It think region prostate gland lie beneath dentate line therefore , pain fiber exist . Groups anesthetized region find significant success pain control10 . No study ever compare various method determine best alleviate patient discomfort office biopsy prostate . With men undergo prostate biopsy , either first time repeat event , would critical knowledge best patient satisfaction . We still know anesthetic cause difference quality life . In addition , patient find cancer biopsy , need determine local anesthetic effect pelvic dissection prostatectomy . INVESTIGATIONAL DESIGN AND METHODS A . Patient Population Recruitment Our study exclude patient base age race . Any male patient see clinic follow condition warrant consent transrectal needle biopsy prostate would recruit study : 1 . Elevated serum PSA 2 . Hypoechoic nodule incidentally discover transrectal ultrasound purpose 3 . Abnormal digital rectal exam ( DRE ) The following exclusion criterion must place prevent complication interference data interpretation : 1 . Patients take narcotic routine basis 2 . Patients Coumadin therapy 3 . Patients ano-rectal disease 4 . Patients history prostatitis , pelvic pain , pelvic floor tension myalgia , pain syndrome 5 . Patients active prostate abscess urinary tract infection 6 . Patients allergy local anesthetic B . Potential Patient Risk The risk study great risk incur standard office biopsy prostate . Most patient undergo biopsy since year 2000 receive transrectal injection local anesthetic prior prostate biopsy . However , complication associate transrectal needle biopsy prostate include follow : 1 . Urinary tract infection , even urosepsis 2 . Erectile dysfunction usually short-lived , may take week recover 3 . Rectal bleeding , range minor spotting severe hematochezia warrant intervention colorectal surgeon 4 . Hematuria , range spot severe require Foley catheter placement bladder irrigation 5 . Hematospermia although harmful patient , may last 2 month 6 . Hypotension due vaso-vagal response These risk part actual prostate biopsy . Our study apply local anesthetic various region around prostate increase risk add new additional risk . C. Risk Prevention There several way prevent complication office biopsy prostate . These method employ staff since begin procedure clinic . Risk decrease enforce follow pre-procedural guideline : 1 . Stop aspirin-containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAID ) agents 7 day prior biopsy . 2 . Begin quinolone ( appropriate antibiotic ) night prior procedure continue prophylaxis total 5 day . 3 . If patient prosthetic joint heart valve , administer appropriate SBE prophylaxis one hour biopsy . 4 . Administer one Fleets enema rectally least one hour biopsy . The risks patient would subject different part study . All prostate biopsy associate small risk , patient suffer long term consequence . Our study mean determine provide best pain relief possible obtain tissue diagnosis identify prostate cancer early possible . D. Budget Funding seek Department Urology Research Committee . These fund use nurse support statistical analysis . We need nurse assistance recruitment consenting , well assist patient complete pre-biopsy survey . This require approximately 10 minute nurse ? time , allocate among approximately 243 study patient . In addition , nurse assist post biopsy survey administration collection . Statistical analysis complete urology research statistician . The small grant project fund $ 5000 allow complete coverage project . No special equipment , medication , supply need obtain . We use material standard part practice . The patient pay fee office biopsy , anesthetic , pathology , cost . E. Justification Subjects Our statistician review prior study regard subject . A total 81 patient require study arm achieve 80 % power detect difference mean 0.4 point visual analog scale . This assume common standard deviation 0.9 use two-tailed t-test 0.050 significance level . F. Research Protocol All patient qualify study recruited time initial consultation urologist department . They meet research study nurse consent exam room . Then , ask complete pre-biopsy survey . The patient also give packet time include post-biopsy survey do 1 4 week procedure . ( All question survey derive previously validate questionnaire . ) After consent , patient randomize one three group determine best administer anesthetic prior prostate biopsy : Group 1 : Injection base seminal vesicle right leave side gland , draw needle distally ensure numb prostate apex Group 2 : Intraprostatic injection 2 sagittal plane , begin base prostate traverse distally toward apex right leave side prostate Group 3 : Injection apex prostate , prostate rectal wall , right leave side gland The patient appropriately refrain aspirin NSAID medication least 10 day . They start appropriate antibiotic night prior biopsy . A Fleets enema already administer self one hour appointment . Upon arrival , meet urology biopsy nurse review study patient . He administer 20 % benzocaine ( Hurricane ) jelly patient rectum prepare patient standard knee-chest prone position . We use standard B-K 7.5 mHz transrectal side-fire ultrasound probe image procedure . The study-coordinator physician administer anesthetic ( 1 % plain lidocaine ) 22g spinal needle transrectal ultrasound guidance group describe : Group 1 : Inject 6cc anesthetic junction base seminal vesicle , draw toward apex prostate right side . This repeat opposite side gland total 12cc anesthetic . Ultrasound used confirm presence anesthetic real-time imaging . Group 2 : Inject 3cc anesthetic sagittal plane , begin base prostate , draw distally toward prostate apex . This repeat another sagittal plane right side gland . The process do leave side gland . A total 12cc anesthetic apply confirm ultrasound guidance . Group 3 : Inject 6 cc anesthetic lateral prostate apex gland rectum use ultrasound guidance confirm position . The procedure repeat side gland . A total 12cc anesthetic apply . ( See Figure 1 image ) A timer set point total 3 minute . The biopsy physician enter room coordinator leave . This doctor perform ultrasound exam prostate search abnormality obtain volume measurement estimate gland size . Following interval , total 12 biopsy obtain . If ultrasound lesion identify , 2 apical , 2 base , 2 mid-gland biopsy perform side prostate . If hypoechoic region note count toward total number biopsy , exceed 12 sample per patient . At completion biopsy , patient ? rectum examine digitally penile meatus inspect rule significant bleed require intervention . Pain analysis first focus study thus , use well-established standard visual analog scale provide patient index rate pain ( See Figure 2 ) . Subjects visual analog scale front . They ask provide number correspond pain level biopsy nurse request rate pain . We ask time point list : 1 . Time transrectal ultrasound probe insertion . 2 . Time anesthetic needle insertion . 3 . Time biopsy . 4 . At completion biopsy session , obtain overall pain response Patients place left lateral decubitus position vital sign reassess slowly allow patient move away biopsy table . He allow get dress recover . The patient allow leave Gonda 7 urology clinic . He send reminder complete questionnaires 1 4 week biopsy . These questionnaire use ass quality life change may bring prostate biopsy . Two survey use determine long change last . In addition , long term study look prostate biopsy anesthetic method affect surgical removal prostate . We identify patient end biopsy positive cancer . If elect surgical management , review surgeon ? operative report identify difficulty encounter case . We would compare three group understand anesthetic location associate difficulty surgical case cod staff surgeon . It also critical review operative time estimate blood loss among three group . G. Anticipated Results Prostate cancer major concern men modern time . They undergo prostate biopsy diagnosis . This procedure vital part diagnostic armamentarium urology . It painful procedure , way improve tolerance . In study , plan define anesthetic method provide best pain relief office biopsy prostate . In addition , see anesthetic impact quality life surgical intervention cancer . This information improve clinical practice patient satisfaction procedure .</detailed_description>
