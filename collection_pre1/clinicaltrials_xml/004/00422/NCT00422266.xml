	<brief_summary>The incidence chronic degenerative disease , especially cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , high world especially India . High blood cholesterol triglyceride level know important risk factor CVD . There strong body evidence beneficial effect plant sterol blood total LDL-cholesterol omega-3 fatty acid fish blood triglyceride . However , combine benefit consume plant sterol omega-3 fatty acid fish oil blood cholesterol triglyceride investigate previously , except one study methodology use appropriate test combination . In addition , study plant sterol efficacy realise far do Western country . The present study investigate efficacy plant sterols omega-3 fatty acid fish oil improve cardiovascular risk profile Indian adult dyslipidemia . It expect , 4 week intervention , men consume plant sterol omega-3 fatty acid fish oil lower cardiovascular risk profile men receive plant sterol fish oil none dietary supplement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize parallel ( 2 x 2 factorial ) design 3 experimental treatment one control treatment . A two week run-in period observe subject give placebo plant sterol . Thereafter subject randomly allocate 4 treatment group intervention period 4 week undergo baseline assessment blood lipid , inflammatory coagulation marker , anthropometry , lifestyle dietary habit . The intervention period close repeat measurement lipid , inflammatory coagulation marker , anthropometry , lifestyle diet . Participants mildly hypercholesterolemic adult male ( TC 5.0-8.0 mmol/L ) , age 35-55 year employee NTPC , Badarpur , New Delhi enrol study . The subject randomly allocate four treatment group ( 1 control 3 experimental , 50 subject per group ) help computer generate random number table . In case surplus volunteer , lottery method selection apply . The active control product almost identical respect taste appearance differ coding . During study , treatment code product blind known person directly involve study . The subject identify unique identification code give time fill interview-schedules . All information obtain subject cod use unique identification code . During intervention period key link subject 's name cod accessible authorized staff . For subject Investigator Sponsor receive blind code envelope detail treatment . In case emergency ( e.g . Serious Adverse Event possibly related treatment , unexpected Adverse Events ) , envelope open identify treatment give subject . The Investigator Sponsor immediately inform de-blinding . Randomization data keep strictly confidential time unblinding . Only blind review meeting PI , Investigator Sponsor , randomization code break make available data analysis .</detailed_description>
