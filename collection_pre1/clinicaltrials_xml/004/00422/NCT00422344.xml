	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety RAD-001 Sunitinib give combination renal cell cancer . We also want find effect ( good bad ) combination RAD-001 Sunitinib tumor . RAD001 pill work shut pathway cell make tumor grow . Sunitinib pill work shut signal cancer cell tell cell grow blood vessel . Without signal , blood vessel tumor shrink .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study RAD001 Sunitinib Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess maximum tolerated dos overall safety tolerability Sunitinib administer combination RAD001 treatment patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . To assess antitumor activity combination Sunitinib RAD001 . This study design confirm 2 agent administer safely combination . Patients begin treatment Sunitinib RAD001 Day 1 . RAD001 administer orally weekly schedule . Sunitinib give orally 4 week , 2 week schedule . DLT determination base toxicity observe Cycle 1 - cycle define Sunitinib dosing ( 6 week ) . Once MTD combination identify , total 10 patient enrolled high dose level allow administration multiple cycle provide potentially therapeutic drug level drug assess safety tolerability obtain preliminary assessment efficacy . Patients treat RAD001 Sunitinib disease progression , significant toxicity withdrawal patient consent . Patients judge derive benefit treatment would offer participation continuation protocol conclusion study .</detailed_description>

Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Major surgery , open biopsy , traumatic injury , radiation systemic therapy within 4 week start study treatment . Anticipation major surgical procedure study . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion irradiate . More 3 prior systemic therapy metastatic RCC . Minor surgical procedure fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 7 day prior Day 0 . No approved investigational anticancer treatment permit study period , include chemotherapy , biological response modifier , hormone therapy , immunotherapy , exception palliative radiation therapy . No investigational drug may use treatment protocol , concurrent participation another clinical trial allow . NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage within past 1 month .
