	<brief_summary>There 42 million people world afflict HIV AIDS 1 million patient US . The epidemiology orofacial pain report extensively literature , yet prevalence severity level pain affect head , face , neck intraoral structure explore population HIV infected individual . Pain , general term , common experience HIV infect patient , even absence cancer opportunistic infection . There variation prevalence pain individual depend stage disease , care setting , study method . The purpose study : 1 . To investigate prevalence orofacial pain HIV infect patient routine dental clinical assessment . 2 . To study sensory phenotype HIV+ patient healthy volunteer use Quantitative Sensory Testing : - To detect presence sensory aberration orofacial complex ; - To identify nerve type involve ; - To identify type orofacial pain base sensory test clinical finding . 3 . To determine psychological condition nutrition status patient HIV . 4 . To find association inherit trait development neuropathic pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients control volunteer recruit Oral medicine Post-graduate clinic NJDS . Medical history take include age , gender , ethnicity , current past illness , current past medication , blood report ( CD4 CD8 count ) obtain routine medical assessment . The clinician perform clinical head neck examination . The examination shall include extra-oral , cranial nerve temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) examination , muscle palpation . A thorough intraoral examination perform . Patients examine pathology oral mucosa , teeth periodontium prior participation study . The evaluation finding report use Research Diagnostic Criteria Temperomandibular disorder . The patient note level pain Visual Analogue Scale pre-existing orofacial pain . Psychological screen nutritional questionnaire complete patient . Quantitative Sensory Testing conduct bilaterally face intraorally tongue . Extraorally , infraorbital mental nerve region test bilaterally use thermal electrical detection threshold . Intraorally tongue test bilaterally thermal electrical detection threshold . Many difference among people way respond symptomatic therapy individual risk HIV+ patient neuropathic pain may affect genetic makeup . We search kind association inherit trait development neuropathic pain study . If patient present evidence pathology require extraction molar ( base clinical radiographic finding ) , patient assess 3 day , 8 day post-extraction 3 week thermal electrical detection threshold . Inclusion criterion : Group I n = 40 HIV+ CD4+T cells/mm³ &gt; 500 determine previous routine medical examination previous blood report . Group II n = 40 HIV+ CD4+T cells/mm³ 200-499 determined previous routine medical examination previous blood report . Group III n = 40 HIV+ CD4+T cells/mm³ &lt; 200 determine previous routine medical examination previous blood report . Control Group n = 40 Healthy normal blood report , without dental pathology .</detailed_description>
