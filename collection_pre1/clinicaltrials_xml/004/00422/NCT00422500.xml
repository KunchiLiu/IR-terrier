	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To compare severity symptom , impact affective health-related functional status , symptom interference among patient advanced-stage lung cancer follow initiation chemotherapy disease status , tumor response chemotherapy , adequacy symptom management . - To examine relationship disease-related treatment-related physical symptom affective impairment patient 's reported symptom interference functional impairment . - To compare symptom severity , adequacy symptom management , interference affective status health-related function patient 's minority status . - To explore serum level inflammatory cytokine chemotherapy among lung cancer patient . - To measure DNA repair capacity ( DRC ) lymphocyte culture patient enrol protocol baseline ( treatment ) follow-up blood draw . The hypothesis patient suboptimal DRC good chemotherapy patient efficient DRC . - To extract DNA genotype polymorphism gene involve nucleotide excision repair pathway involved response pain ( opioid receptor , dopamine receptor , COMT ) . We hypothesize : 1 . Polymorphisms NER gene modulate DNA repair capacity also effect response chemotherapy outcome . 2 . Cytokine gene polymorphism account variation symptom outcome ( specific symptom symptom cluster ) , chemotherapy . 3 . The COMT val/met polymorphism affect metabolism catecholamine modulation response sustain pain . 4 . Dopamine receptor polymorphism result decrease density dopamine receptor result deficit dopamine pathway . also affect response pain . - To evaluate neurocognitive function determine prevalence , severity , pattern cognitive symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One way learn symptom chemotherapy look certain protein call cytokine ( find blood ) change therapy . Another way look symptom change treatment . Before therapy start , ask complete several questionnaire visit thoracic clinic M. D. Anderson . These questionnaire measure physical emotional ( mental ) symptom . The questionnaire take 60 minute finish . You also ask complete cognitive ( mental ) questionnaire take 25 minute complete . During visit , research nurse teach use interactive voice response telephone system measure symptom . The research nurse ask convenient time telephone call , make sure system program call time . The date call close date weekly clinic visit . Symptoms monitor weekly chemotherapy treatment use interactive voice response telephone system . The automate telephone system call week , use numeric key pad telephone , rate severity symptom much interfere daily life . Once complete therapy , phone system call every two week six month . The information collect call use research study . In addition telephone call , research nurse arrange meet approximately every 6 week clinic visit . She ask complete survey symptom , mood , quality life . This meeting take 45 minute . You also ask complete cognitive ( mental ) questionnaire take 25 minute complete . Research staff also obtain medical record clinical information lab value treatment period . If agree participate companion caregiver study , study staff use demographic clinical data study influence symptoms caregiver 's physical mental health . You encourage report symptom treat physician study , especially symptom rate great 7 0 10 scale . This investigational study . A total 224 patient take part multicenter study . Up 112 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
