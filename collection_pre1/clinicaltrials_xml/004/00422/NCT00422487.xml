	<detailed_description>The current study design test short-term effectiveness tolerability MBX-2044 patient type 2 diabetes currently control one two non-TZD hypoglycemic agent ( ) include sulfonylurea , meglitinides , metformin , α-glucosidase inhibitor Byetta® . Eligible patient enrol one follow treatment cohort receive either placebo MBX-2044 1.5 , 4.5 , 15 , 30 , 60 mg/day double-blinded study 14-day treatment period . Patients evaluated adverse event vital sign daily . All efficacy laboratory safety measure assess 2 week . This study provide important information regard glucose-lowering efficacy MBX-2044 safety MBX-2044 ( especially weight gain edema ) diabetic . It also provide important information appropriate dos use subsequent longer-term study evaluate safety efficacy MBX-2044 alone combination anti-diabetic agent .</detailed_description>
