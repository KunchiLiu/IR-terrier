	<brief_summary>Current estimate suggest 65 % American adult overweight obese . Excess body weight associate increase risk number metabolic abnormality , include high blood sugar , high blood pressure , high triglyceride level , low HDL ( `` good '' ) cholesterol level . Insulin resistance ( body become less sensitive blood sugar-lowering hormone insulin , hormone need keep blood sugar level control ) also frequently occur result excess body weight . These abnormality increase risk heart disease serious medical problem . Individuals overweight often number abnormality time , situation often call `` metabolic syndrome . '' Dietary change , physical activity , weight loss lead improvement metabolic abnormality describe . However , best type diet people metabolic syndrome know . This study design test effect several promising dietary pattern , without weight loss , overweight adult metabolic syndrome . Most individual metabolic syndrome know condition , screen many healthy overweight volunteer see may eligible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Metabolic Effects Different Weight Loss Diets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Several dietary approach , include Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension study diet ( DASH diet ) low glycemic index diet ( low GI diet ) , may helpful overweight individual metabolic syndrome . The DASH diet rich fruit , vegetable , whole grain , low-fat dairy product . It also contain moderate amount nut , bean , fish , poultry . Consumption red meat , sweet , sugary beverage limit . As result , DASH diet contain potassium , magnesium , calcium , fiber less total fat , saturate fat , cholesterol , simple sugar , sodium average American diet . The DASH diet show low blood pressure LDL cholesterol ( `` bad '' cholesterol ) . It also show effective diet weight loss . It may also reduce inflammation insulin resistance , two important feature metabolic syndrome . Low GI diet typically low carbohydrate content high protein content average American diet . Many popular diet book promote use low glycemic index diet . In study , low GI diet contain plenty fruit vegetable moderate amount nut , bean , lean meat , fish , reduced-fat dairy product . Refined grain , potato , sweet avoid . The low GI diet help improve level blood sugar insulin blood meal . It may also help control hunger meal . Some researcher believe may promote weight loss diet , especially people metabolic syndrome . The low GI diet may also reduce cholesterol triglyceride level . Although DASH diet low GI diet appear beneficial effect , clear whether one diet good people metabolic syndrome . It also clear whether diet would better weight loss reduced-calorie average American diet . This weight loss study design test metabolic effect DASH diet low GI diet , compare average American diet . STUDY OVERVIEW : Up 18 research volunteer study Rockefeller University Hospital multi-phase study almost 15 week duration . This study include 2-week run-in period home , 19-day inpatient period weight kept stable , 8-week outpatient weight loss period , 2-week inpatient period weight stability lower body weight . All food provide 13 week ( inpatient period 8-week outpatient weight loss period ) . Volunteers first undergo testing ( describe ) baseline , average American diet . They randomize one three diet ( DASH diet , low GI diet , average American diet ) . Weight initially keep stable two week study diet . At end first inpatient period , volunteer undergo repeat test assess metabolic effect diet , absence weight loss . Volunteers discharge home 8 week , receive 50 % reduced-calorie study diet . Volunteers return Rockefeller University Hospital twice week outpatient phase weight-management skill train follow-up study staff . It expect volunteer lose 5 9 % start weight time . At end weight loss phase , volunteer readmitted research hospital final 2-week stay . Body weight maintain new , low weight , volunteer undergo repeat test study diet . At conclusion testing , volunteer discharge hospital study conclude . TESTING : During study , number test procedure perform various time . These include : - Questionnaires physical activity , eat habit , attitude food , quality-of-life , hunger - A 3-day record food intake baseline - Use pedometer ( step-counter ) ass usual physical activity - Blood test ( include blood sugar , insulin level , cholesterol level , fat hormone , inflammatory marker ) - 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor - Measurement energy expenditure ( rate body burn calorie ) - Noninvasive assessment body composition weight loss - Insulin clamp procedure ( insulin sugar infuse vein help determine sensitive person 's body insulin )</detailed_description>
