	<brief_summary>Women breast cancer eligible breast conserve surgery node-involvement sometimes treated chemotherapy front , hop allow woman keep breast decrease size excision breast cancer . While current research show survival whether woman treat chemotherapy first surgery first breast cancer , investigator yet know treat woman persistent breast cancer receive primary chemotherapy . This study look use combination regimen two agent ( gemcitabine capecitabine ) , active breast cancer , use Avastin see regimen give woman treat primary chemotherapy surgery , consider high risk relapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Chemotherapy Avastin Treatment Women With Breast Cancer High Risk Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient locally advance breast cancer ( LABC ) primary neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) become accepted standard treatment . Advantages NAC include shrink primary tumor , often render unresectable cancer resectable , theoretically concurrent treatment occult metastatic disease prior definitive local therapy ( surgery +/- radiation therapy ) . NAC reduce extent surgery require management local breast cancer mastectomy lump- segmentectomy , without compromise major outcome measure , overall disease free survival . At time , current standard care woman felt candidate NAC anthracycline + taxane regimen . The intent induce pCR note strong indicator survival . Yet , large NSABP study , proportion woman achieve less 20 % regimen raise major challenge clinical practice : appropriate treatment woman persistent disease NAC ? Given gemcitabine capecitabine non-cross-resistant anthracyclines taxanes use different mechanism action , acceptable toxicity profile , absence standard option therapy interested utilizing agent couple bevacizumab adjuvant treatment woman residual breast cancer follow primary chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
