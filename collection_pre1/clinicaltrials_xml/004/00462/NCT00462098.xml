	<detailed_description>Osteonecrosis jaw ( ONJ ) recently recognize associate bisphosphonate ( BP ) therapy , however little information natural history , treatment prevention strategy condition1 . Bisphosphonates , particularly compound contain aliphatic chain amino group R2 position , ( pamidronate , alendronate zoledronate ) extremely effective widely use treatment breast cancer , prostate cancer , multiple myeloma non-malignant bone disease . Although ONJ appear develop less one percent patient take drug , seriousness disease plus current lack treatment option make difficult clinical problem This study randomize 35 70 patient receive HBO addition routine oral surgery therapy ONJ follow group 2-year period . The study design interventional , prospective , randomized trial 2-year follow period . Seventy subject meet inclusion criterion ONJ recruit participate physician randomize receive 40 HBO treatment 4 week period continue normal oral care . No subject , HBO treat , ask change , initiate discontinue ongoing therapy may receive primary care giver ONJ medical condition . The analysis compare remission rate two group control age , gender , race , previous local trauma surgery , tumor type , diabetes , immunosuppression , bisphosphonate duration , indication ( hypercalcemia ) , infection , corticosteroid , thalidomide dental hygiene . All subject closely follow throughout 24 month course study weekly contact phone email log jaw pain level well record change general medical condition . The 17 question Duke Health Profile use measure quality life indicator 4 key point study . Comparison ( ) : 1 ) clinical remission rate patient receive receive HBO . 2 ) Bone turnover molecular measure osteoclast signal ONJ patient HBO relative non-diseased control ( labs non-diseased control obtain companion study ) .</detailed_description>
