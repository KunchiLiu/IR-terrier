	<brief_summary>The study open-label , single arm multicenter Phase II study evaluate safety efficacy combination Abraxane Avastin first-line therapy patient unresectable metastatic malignant melanoma . The patient sample approximately 50 individual , male females 18 year age old measurable metastatic melanoma . Patients treat Abraxane administer weekly 3 week via 30-minute IV infusion at150 mg/m2 follow 1 week rest ( 28-day cycle ) . Avastin administer dose 10 mg/kg every 2 week ( without rest period ) . Patients evaluated disease progression every 2 month disease progression unacceptable toxicity offer ongoing therapy progressive disease unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It suggest chemotherapy administration may synergistic effect antiangiogenic agent Avastin . A `` Proof Principal '' concept synergistic effect chemotherapy antiangiogenic therapy show favorable result report temozolomide administer combination thalidomide melanoma , favorable result report use FOLFOX4 combination Avastin previously treat patient advanced metastatic colorectal cancer , approval combination Avastin 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy treatment patient metastatic carcinoma colon rectum . A number line evidence suggest combination Abraxane Avastin may effective first-line therapy melanoma : - Taxanes active agent melanoma : 1 . In clinical trial patient fail combination chemotherapy ( Dartmouth regimen , 24 % response rate patient treat paclitaxel ( combination tamoxifen ) . 2 . Paclitaxel use Phase III trial carboplatin Sorafenib patient metastatic melanoma fail one previous systemic chemotherapeutic treatment . 3 . In phase II trial docetaxel patient metastatic melanoma , objective response last 2 year observe . - Abraxane taxane efficacy superior Taxol treatment metastatic breast cancer . Abraxane evaluate first- second-line therapy patient metastatic melanoma . Results encourage . In study , Abraxane combine Avastin effort improve clinical benefit prolong time disease progression . The primary end-point study progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4 month . Secondary end-points include progression-free survival , overall survival ( OS ) , objective Response Rate ( RR ) patient measurable lesion , time objective response , duration objective response patient measurable lesion , safety tolerability combination .</detailed_description>
