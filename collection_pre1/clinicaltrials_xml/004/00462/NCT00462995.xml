	<brief_summary>2.5 Rationale preoperative erlotinib therapy Erlotinib EFGR tyrosine kinase inhibitor demonstrate survival advantage symptom improvement large phase III trial failure chemotherapy advance non-small cell lung cancer ( Shepherd , Rodrigues Pereira et al . 2005 ) . Although potential utility erlotinib earlier stage NSCLC unclear , give activity advanced disease minimal toxicity profile , likely subset patient may benefit potentially cure adjuvant erlotinib therapy . Erlotinib may also great antitumour activity earlier stage disease . Therefore , propose phase II study ass erlotinib pre-operatively clinical stage 1 2 NSCLC , downstream effect signal transduction pathway possible marker treatment resistance sensitivity . The propose study involve administer oral erlotinib four week ( 28 day ) preoperatively early stage ( 1A/B , 2A/B ) NSCLC . Current wait time surgical resection early stage NSCLC UHN range 4 6 week ( Hui , Johnston et al . 2004 ) , thus patient would experience significant delay time surgery trial design . This study provide opportunity explore impact erlotinib early stage NSCLC human , pharmacodynamic assessment expect 100 % patient post-treatment , addition correlative imaging . This study evaluate feasibility preoperative therapy erlotinib , may facilitate identification predictive marker response erlotinib early stage NSCLC . This may help define subset patient would benefit adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor , may require adjuvant approach include chemotherapy clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment administer outpatient basis . Patients may identify thoracic surgeon , respirologists and/or interventional chest radiologist study participation upon clinical radiographic assessment . 4.2 Diagnostic biopsy , Pretreatment Investigations If patient already core FNA biopsy referral , material seek original pathologist review inclusion study appropriate consent seek . If patient biopsy upon presentation thoracic surgeon , consent inclusion trial , percutaneous biopsy mandate part entry study . The order test treat thoracic surgeon . As part procedure large localize needle insert tumour . In collaboration pathology , fine needle pass out needle immediate diagnosis make time fine needle aspiration biopsy . After pathologic diagnosis cancer confirm , additional biopsy obtain material correlative study perform standard localize needle , assume complication technical difficulty arise . These study do collaboration thoracic interventional radiologist Diagnostic Imaging , perform lung fine needle aspirate biopsy . All patient undergo pre-study assessment symptom , performance status , radiographic assessment blood test ( complete blood count , electrolytes , liver renal function test ) . Blood sample treatment post treatment erlotinib bank future serum proteomic analysis . Assessment response occur 4-week treatment period . Toxicity assess continuously , patient assessment weekly treatment , repeat blood test 2 week image measurable disease 4 week . All subject invite initial diagnostic biopsy subsequent surgical tumor specimen examine part laboratory correlate component study . Patients consider evaluable pharmacodynamic assessment complete least 21 plan 28 day therapy . Patients PET-CT scan study do pre- post-treatment ( see section 7 ) . If enrolment PET-CT imaging reveals mediastinal disease ( IIIA IIIB ) extensive disease pathologically confirm patient enrol study . Once diagnosis establish assessment complete , oral erlotinib administer dose 150 mg ( 1 pill ) daily 28 day prior plan mediastinoscopy and/or surgery . Tablets take preferably morning 200 mL water least 1 hour 2 hour meal . If patient forgets take dose , take last miss dose soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose due . If patient vomit take dose , dose may retake tablet see emesis . The last dose erlotinib administer early morning mediastinoscopy surgery . If mediastinoscopy reveals presence Stage III disease , patient 's mediastinoscopy sample may still analyze part correlative study . Patients follow 90 day long require last dose erlotinib ensure resolution erlotinib-related toxicity . However patient offer standard therapy stage III disease study protocol , example combination chemotherapy , radiation without surgical resection . If patient proceed thoracotomy post-chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy , resection specimen eligible correlative protocol .</detailed_description>

For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence , hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately ; Patients warfarin exclude trial require INR measure intensively initial stage start study drug alteration INR note . This intensive monitoring entail measurement ( 3 X week first week twice weekly remainder trial ) ; Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients clinically T2N1 ( 2B ) , and/or T3N0 ( 2B ) require sleeve lobectomy , and/or chest wall resection ; tumor higher staging ; Patients receive prior anticancer treatment chemotherapy , radiotherapy EGFR inhibitor therapy ; Patients previous diagnosis cancer within 5 year exclude except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix breast ; Patients may receive investigational anticancer agent study ; History allergic reaction erlotinib ; Preexisting diarrhea ³ NCI CTC Grade 2 ( 4 6 loose stool per day ) control standard therapy ; Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure evidence cardiac dysfunction , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active peptic ulcer disease , poorly control diabetes mellitus , clinically significant untreated ophthalmologic ( e.g .

Pregnant woman exclude study , effect erlotinib develop fetus unknown . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother erlotinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated combination . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction erlotinib . Active malignancy site include combine small cell nonsmall cell carcinomas pulmonary carcinoid tumor ; Because drug induce CYP3A4 enzymes show significantly reduce plasma concentration erlotinib , patient ongoing use phenytoin , rifampicin , carbamazepine , barbiturate , rifampicin , St John 's Wort exclude ; Incomplete heal previous surgery ; Use agent decrease gastric pH , include proton pump inhibitor , histamine2 receptor blocker sodium bicarbonate . Use calcium magnesium base elixir include ; Concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitor , e.g . itraconazole , may result increased level erlotinib ( TARCEVA® ) .
