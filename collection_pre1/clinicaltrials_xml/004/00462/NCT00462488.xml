	<brief_title>Study Vicinium Treating Patients With Non-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II study perform assess efficacy tolerability intravesical Vicinium patient urothelial carcinoma situ bladder . Bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment previously fail patient . A total 46 patient treat Vicinium half administer 30mg/dose per week 6 week ( cohort 1 ) half ( cohort 2 ) dose administer per week 12 consecutive week . Vicinium well tolerate cohort patient complete treatment schedule . A complete response Vicinium see 9 22 patient ( 41 % ) cohort 1 9 23 ( 39 % ) cohort 2 3-month evaluation . A total 20 patient ( 44 % ) achieve complete response . Two patient without carcinoma situ achieve complete response include study due development non-invasive papillary ( Ta ) disease . Median time recurrence patient achieve complete response 274 408 day cohorts 1 2 , respectively . Overall 7 patient ( 16 % ) remain disease free . Post-study assessment demonstrate patient still disease free last follow-up ( 18 25 month ) . The common adverse event mild moderate reversible bladder symptom .</detailed_description>
