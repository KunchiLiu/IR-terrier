	<brief_summary>FES form treatment device aid movement people damage brain spinal cord . Small electrical impulse use excite/stimulate nerve supply paralyzed muscle . This activate muscle , enable produce basic useful movement . Self-adhesive patch ( electrode ) place skin close nerve supply muscle connect wire stimulator produce impulse . In way , FES use correct muscle weakness cause injury brain spinal cord . Repetitive task practice `` activity-based '' therapy program show enhance recovery hand arm function stroke . This therapy consist set training activity design qualified therapist specific functional ability perform impaired hand . These activity design stimulate functional improvement repetitive practice . Spasticity nervous system disorder certain muscle continuously contract . Botox injection commonly use help reduce spasticity area body increase muscle tone . This research design look additional benefit may occur Botox injection combine specific occupational therapy exercise device use functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) help improve muscle function stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) Persons Receiving Botulinum Neurotoxin Upper Extremity Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-blinded , randomize control trial examine effect repetitive task practice ( RTP ) functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) individual receive routine clinical Botox 速 injection upper extremity spasticity . Botox速 injection combination repetitive task practice ( RTP ) use routinely manage upper limb spasticity stroke acquire brain injury . RTP activity-based rehabilitation program show effective promote motor recovery ( Wolf et al. , 2002 ) , require sufficient level baseline motor function . Since FES enhances motor function , hypothesize FES-assisted RTP intervention provide great improvement hand function RTP alone patient receive Botox 速 injection . The primary outcome upper extremity use activity daily live assess observationally motor activity log ( MAL-O ) . Secondary outcomes 1 ) dexterous hand function measure action research arm test ( ARAT ) ; 2 ) client 's perception self-performance activity daily live assess ( MAL - Self Report ) ; 3 ) global upper extremity impairment assess Chedoke-McMaster Assessment ( CMA ) ; 4 ) clinical spasticity assess Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . The primary endpoint 6 week post-injection . Outcomes also assess secondary endpoint , 12 week post-injection , determine persistence treatment effect .</detailed_description>

Able follow reliably 1step instruction . Written informed consent . Females enrol study childbearing age require use adequate measure birth control entire study period . Those agree exclude . Uncontrolled , clinically significant medical condition condition evaluation . Severe , fix joint contracture affect arm . Patients mild contracture significantly impact function include base upon assessment PI . Known allergy sensitivity component study medication . Females pregnant , breastfeeding , plan pregnancy study think may pregnant start study , female childbearing potential unable unwilling use reliable form contraception study . Concurrent participation another investigational drug device study participation 30 day immediately prior study enrollment . Treatment botulinum toxin serotype reason le 3 month prior initial date injection study . Any medical condition may put subject increase risk exposure botulinum toxin type A include diagnose myasthenia gravis , EatonLambert syndrome , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , disorder might interfere neuromuscular function . Evidence recent alcohol drug abuse . Infection skin disorder anticipate injection and/or electrical stimulation site . Any condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study . Use aminoglycoside antibiotic , curare like agent , agent might interfere neuromuscular function . Individuals cardiac pacemaker , defibrillator , baclofen pump . Individuals unhealed heal fracture dislocation arm evaluate .</criteria>
