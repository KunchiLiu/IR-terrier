	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give MS-275 together GM-CSF work treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome and/or relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia . MS-275 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Giving MS-275 together GM-CSF may effective treatment myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MS-275 GM-CSF Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome and/or Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine clinical response patient myelodysplastic syndrome and/or relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia acute lymphocytic leukemia treat MS-275 combination sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical activity regimen , term change peripheral blood count change individual patient transfusion requirement , patient . II . Determine biologic activity regimen , term change peripheral blood bone marrow phenotype ( i.e. , induction marker myeloid differentiation lymphoid differentiation ) change detectable cytogenetic abnormality blood marrow compartment , patient . III . Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral MS-275 day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously daily day 1-42 course 3 5 day 1-35 course 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2-6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 2 course study therapy , patient achieve complete partial response may receive additional 4 course . Patients maintain stable disease 2 month completion 6 course study therapy may receive additional 6 course time disease progression , provide meet original eligibility criterion . Patients undergo blood bone marrow ( BM ) collection baseline periodically study biologic correlative study . Peripheral blood bone marrow sample assess change progenitor phenotype clonogenic growth flow cytometry change cytogenetics ( i.e. , malignant : nonmalignant cell ratio BM CD34-positive cell , peripheral blood monocyte , peripheral blood neutrophil , bone marrow peripheral blood lymphoblast ) FISH . Terminal differentiation CD34-positive progenitor cell study vitro long-term culture . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
