	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis hematopoietic stem cell sensitive elevated level TNFa , potentiate differentiation myeloid effector cell . During migration bone marrow end organ , cell express unique set gene function prime cell respond critical differentiation signal . Elucidation transcriptome microarray analysis provide insight novel drug target formal understanding biochemical molecular genetic event link IMIDs . To test hypothesis , determine transcriptome peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate monocyte 20 normal healthy donor , 10 patient psoriatic arthritis , 10 patient psoriasis , 10 patient Crohn 's disease 10 patient rheumatoid arthritis . The transcriptome also examine inflamed intestinal tissue patient Crohn 's disease , psoriatic skin synovial tissue patient rheumatoid psoriatic arthritis .</detailed_description>
