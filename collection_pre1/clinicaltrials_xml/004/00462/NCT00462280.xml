	<brief_summary>The use lovastatin may slow disease progression patient high risk melanoma . It yet know whether lovastatin effective placebo treat patient high risk melanoma . This randomized phase II trial study well give lovastatin placebo work treat patient high risk melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lovastatin Treating Patients At High Risk Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate primary endpoint trial , analysis histopathologic regression atypical nevi response 6-month trial oral ( PO ) lovastatin vs. placebo subject atypical nevus . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical regression atypical nevus lovastatin vs. placebo group . II . To evaluate secondary endpoint change nevi number subject ' back lovastatin vs. placebo group . III . To evaluate number molecular biomarkers secondary endpoint lovastatin vs. placebo group . IV . To evaluate correlation serum marker know affected lovastatin endpoint choose . V. To evaluate safety tolerability dose regimen , dose escalation . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm per group . ARM I : Patients ( two match nevi OR one large nevus ) receive lovastatin PO daily ( QD ) 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients ( two match nevi OR one large nevus ) receive placebo PO QD 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
