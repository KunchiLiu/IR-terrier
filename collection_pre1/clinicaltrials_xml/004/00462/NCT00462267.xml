	<brief_title>Examining Feasibility Collaborative Care Treatment Overweight Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight / obesity among youth recently declare `` public health crisis '' United States Western country due alarm increase prevalence ( Flegal , 1999 ; Kohn &amp; Booth , 2003 ; Lobstein et al. , 2004 ; Sokol , 2000 ) . Over past decade , overweight youth ( Body mass index [ BMI ] &gt; 95th percentile ) increase 4 % school-age child , 6 - 11 year old . Adolescents , 12 - 19 year age even overweight ( 5 % ) ( Ogden et al. , 2002 ) . Further , American adolescent high prevalence overweight among 15 western country include cross-sectional , nationally representative school-based study ( Lissau et al. , 2004 ) . Such trend particularly trouble give psychosocial physical health risk associate overweight childhood ( Must &amp; Strauss , 1999 ) . Overweight among youth appear confer longer-term health risk even among later normative weight adult ( Must et al. , 1992 ) . Further , longer-term health risk probability adult obesity great overweight adolescent develop weight problem earlier childhood ( Must et al. , 1992 ; Whitaker et al. , 1997 ) . Collectively , factor suggest adolescent weight control important public health priority . Clinic-based weight control treatment youth demonstrate success , however , empirically-supported intervention design young school-age child family ( see Epstein et al. , 1998 review ) . Even though large volume research explore adult-weight control ( see NIH-NHLBI , 1998 review ) ( though limit ) substantial research examines childhood obesity ( see Epstein et al. , 1998 review ) , obesity treatment adolescent adequately study . Furthermore , almost empirically tested weight control intervention among youth base academic research clinic rather primary care medical setting , weight problem among youth often identify , arguably , could efficiently treat . Placing adolescent weight-related intervention within primary medical care setting could make intervention cost-effective easy disseminate . The purpose study assess feasibility , acceptability , relative cost , efficacy collaborative primary care-based behavioral lifestyle intervention ( Enriched Intervention - EI ) overweight adolescent female family . This multi-component intervention , adapt gender developmental stage , include combination assessment , group teen parent session , individual telephone-based coaching contact , distinct collaborative care component follow-up visit youth 's primary care provider [ PCP ] . Further , compare EI low intensity intervention [ LII ] ( assessment information healthy diet activity , follow-up visit youth 's PCP ) usual care control condition . We hypothesize : 1 . Adolescents participate Enriched Intervention ( EI ) great decrease BMI percentile score adolescent receive Low Intensity Intervention ( LII ) Usual Care . 2 . Adolescent EI improve healthy lifestyle skill ( e.g. , physical activity , less junk food soda ) compare receive LII Usual Care . 3 . Adolescents EI report high psychosocial functioning quality life outcome receive LII Usual Care . 4 . Neither intervention result increase problematic eat weight-related behavior belief .</detailed_description>
