	<brief_summary>Acute chest pain common cause hospital admission . Active approach direct towards diagnosis treatment potentially life threatening condition , especially acute coronary syndrome coronary artery disease . However , considerable number patient may chest pain caused biomechanical dysfunction muscle joint chest wall cervical thoracic spine ( 20 % ) . The diagnostic approach treatment option group patient scarce lack formal clinical study validate outcome measure address effect manual treatment approach . Objective : This single blind randomize clinical trial investigate whether chiropractic treatment reduce pain improve function population patient acute , musculoskeletal chest pain compare advice direct towards promote self-management . Methods : Among patient admit chest pain clinic university hospital suspicion acute coronary syndrome , 120 patient episode acute chest pain musculoskeletal origin include study . All patient complete chest pain clinic diagnostic procedure , acute coronary syndrome obvious reason chest pain exclude . After completion study evaluation program , patient randomize one two group : A ) advice promote self-management individual instruction focus posture muscle stretch ; B ) course chiropractic therapy ten treatment session focus high velocity , low amplitude manipulation cervical thoracic spine together choice mobilisation soft tissue technique . In order establish suitable outcome measure , two pilot study conduct . Outcome measure pain , function , overall health , patient-rated treatment effect measure 4 , 12 , 52 week follow treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Study Comparing Manual Treatment Advice Acute , Musculoskeletal Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Acute chest pain one common reason hospital admission . ( Bechgaard , 1982 ) In Denmark alone , 30,000 patient admit medical department chest pain . ( Fruergaard , 1992 ) In United States chest pain reason 20-30 percent acute medical hospital admission . ( Capewell , 2000 ) However , estimate 5-20 percent admission acute chest pain department cause chest pain musculoskeletal origin . ( Knockaert 2002 ; Spalding 2003 ; Fruergaard 1996 ) Chest pain patient normal coronary anatomy excellent prognosis survival future risk cardiac morbidity similar report background population . ( Berman 1999 ; Klocke 2003 ) However , three quarter patient non-cardiac chest pain continue suffer residual chest pain large socio-economic consequence . ( Spalding 2003 ; Launbjerg 1997 ; Ockene 1980 ; Eslick 2002 ; Tew 1995 ; Wielgosz 1984 ; Achem 2000 ) An extensive body literature address patient management protocol patient present chest pain primarily focus cardiopulmonary , gastroesophageal , psychological condition cause chest symptom , treatment protocol musculoskeletal chest pain remain , however , scarce . Neither effect medical treatment ( oral anti-inflammatory drug ) , exercise ( strength and/or stretch ) , advice investigate . In particular , lack formal clinical study examine effectiveness manual/manipulative approach manage musculoskeletal chest pain . To best author knowledge , one study exist deal aspect . ( Christensen , 2005 ) Therefore , aim single-blind randomized clinical trial compare effect chiropractic treatment versus advice direct towards promote self-management population patient musculoskeletal chest pain use standardized outcome measure . Further , cost-effectiveness analysis along side RCT perform . METHODS Design : Single-blinded Randomized Trial . Study sample : The patient recruit university hospital chest pain clinic . The chest pain clinic part large specialized cardiology department . All patient undergo standardized evaluation program ruling acute coronary syndrome obvious significant cardiac non-cardiac disease . Sixty patient include two intervention group , total 120 participant . The patient include part large study diagnosis musculoskeletal chest pain . Examination baseline data : Following discharge chest pain clinic , patient record screen inclusion non-inclusion criterion , potential participant invite participate . Within 7 day , participant assess individual baseline test . First , complete battery questionnaires include information social , occupation , education , physical lifestyle factor , expectation treatment outcome , baseline value outcome measure ( see ) . Signed consent form obtain participant . Next , patient musculoskeletal chest pain identify use standardized examination protocol . The examination protocol consist 3 part : 1 ) semi-structured interview ( include pain characteristic , symptom lungs gastrointestinal system , past medical history , height weight , risk factor ischemic heart disease ) , 2 ) general health examination ( include blood pressure pulse , heart lung stethoscopy , abdominal palpation , neck auscultation , clinical sign leave ventricular failure , neurological examination upper low extremity term reflex , sensibility touch , muscle strength , well orthopaedic examination neck shoulder joint order rule nerve root compression syndrome . ) , 3 ) specific manual examination muscle joint neck , thoracic spine thorax ( include active range motion , manual palpation muscular tenderness 14 point anterior chest wall , palpation paraspinal muscular tenderness segmentally , motion palpation joint-play restriction thoracic spine ( Th1-8 ) , end play restriction cervical thoracic spine ) . The examination program together detailed case history apply clinician population chest pain patient make diagnosis pain musculoskeletal system , Cervico-thoracic Angina ( CTA ) . Randomization : Only CTA positive participant draw seal , opaque envelope number succession contain information treatment allocation . The randomization sequence computer generate . The envelope arrange cluster vary size . The examine clinician manages hand envelope participant , blind treatment allocation . Interventions : CTA positive participant randomize receive advice promote self-management ( advice group ) standard course chiropractic treatment ( therapy group ) . Advice group : Advice direct towards promote self-management . The participant tell chest pain generally benign , self limit course . The participant receive individual instruction regard posture two three exercise aim increase spinal muscle stretch base clinical evaluation . They advise seek medical attention re-evaluation ( general physician , chest pain clinic emergency department ) case severe unfamiliar chest pain . The session last average 15 minute . Further , advice group also ask seek manual treatment next four week . Therapy group : Participants therapy group undergo physical examination experience , primary sector chiropractor , last one hour . The chiropractor choose individual treatment strategy base combination finding , patient history , standardize protocol reflect routine practice . The standardized treatment protocol include high velocity , low amplitude manipulation direct towards thoracic and/or cervical spine combination follow : Joint mobilization , soft tissue technique , stretch , stabilize strengthen exercise , heat cold treatment , advice . The protocol specifies ten treatment session approximately 20 minute , 1-3 time per week , treatment patient pain free . The chiropractor record type treatment render session . Follow-up : Follow-up data collect four week , 3 month one year ( Figure 1 ) Data analyzes : Data analyze research group member blind group status . The analysis base intention treat principle . Both parametric non parametric principle use compare treatment effect group identify baseline predictor successful treatment outcome . Finally , base prior definition success , number need treat calculate . Cost-effectiveness analysis : A cost comparison therapy advice group perform use data direct indirect cost . A cost-utility analysis compare therapy advice group perform use EuroQol 5D .</detailed_description>
