	<brief_summary>Post-partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) define blood loss great 500 mL vaginal delivery . Delayed diagnosis PPH major cause maternal morbidity mortality . Obstetricians estimate blood loss delivery visual estimation blood collect obstetric drape . Blood often mixed urine surgical sponge . The urine , blood , sponge collect cone shape plastic bag suspend perineum delivery . Visual estimation blood loss insensitive diagnosing PPH . In one study visual assessment blood loss underestimate postpartum blood loss 33 % 50 % compare objective measurement blood loss use photospectrometry . Other study show magnitude underestimation increase amount blood loss increase . A limitation previous study `` gold standard '' blood loss determination third stage labor . Care provider ( obstetrician , anesthesiologist , labor &amp; delivery nurse ) need able accurately estimate blood loss order well care mother prevent morbidity mortality . It unknown whether provider type experience ( obstetric anesthesiology resident , fellow , attend physician , nurse ) influence accuracy blood loss estimation , whether blood loss estimation improve provide graduated marking vaginal delivery drape .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Packed red blood cell discard blood bank mixed normal saline simulate whole blood hematocrit 33 % . A total eight isolate study station set ( study participant able visualize vaginal delivery drape one station time ) . The simulated blood mixed urine sponge place suspend blood collection drape use vaginal delivery Northwestern Memorial Hospital . Two type drape use : drape without calibrated marking drape calibrate marking . Calibrated volume marking begin 500 mL 500 mL interval 2500 mL . Study participant randomize one two group . Randomization occur block depend provider type . Group 1 view unmarked vaginal collection drape first Group 2 view collection drape calibrate marking first . Both group analyze initial four study station random order . At completion four study station , group evaluate drape without marking cross view station calibrate marking group view uncalibrated drape view calibrate drape . Each study participant view station write his/her estimation blood loss data card . Study participants NOT allow change answer record . Demographic data study participant include provider type , level training/years practice , gender .</detailed_description>
