	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , leucovorin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth rectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy bevacizumab together radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well give combination chemotherapy bevacizumab without radiation therapy work treat patient locally advanced rectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium ( FOLFOX ) , bevacizumab substitute pelvic radiotherapy without compromise R0 resection rate patient locally advanced rectal cancer . Secondary - Determine whether 3-year local recurrence rate ≤ 10 % achieve patient treated regimen . - Determine proportion patient achieve complete pathologic response treatment regimen . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , open-label , pilot study . - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , bevacizumab IV 10 minute day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 48 hour day 1 2 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 48 hour day 1 2 week 9 11 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 3 week completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy , patient undergo restaging evaluation . Patients evidence disease progression endorectal ultrasound ( ERUS ) , pelvic MRI , CT scan chest/abdomen AND remain candidate R0 resection may proceed directly surgical resection within 4-6 week completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients progressive disease candidate R0 resection , proceed neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . - Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 day week receive concurrent fluorouracil IV continuously 5½ week . Within 4-7 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo surgical resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
