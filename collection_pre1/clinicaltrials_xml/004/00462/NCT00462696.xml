	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , may help learn well chemotherapy work kill breast cancer cell allow doctor plan good treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , epirubicin docetaxel , may stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study MRI evaluate early response chemotherapy woman receive chemotherapy infiltrate breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Evaluating Early Response Chemotherapy Women Receiving Chemotherapy Infiltrating Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate feasibility ( reproducibility repeatability ) MRI assess tumor vascularity woman receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy infiltrative breast cancer . Secondary - Compare result obtain semiquantitative measurement vascularization ( MRI ) vs traditional empirical evaluation . - Evaluate MRI accuracy measurement tumoral volume completion chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This uncontrolled , nonrandomized study . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise epirubicin hydrochloride IV docetaxel IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo dynamic-contrast MRI treatment , 3 week first course chemotherapy , 3 week completion chemotherapy . They also undergo bilateral mammogram sonography clinical examination . Within 22-35 day completion chemotherapy , patient undergo breast-conserving surgical resection tumor lymph node mastectomy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
