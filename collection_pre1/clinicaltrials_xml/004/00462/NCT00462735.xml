	<brief_summary>For advanced head neck cancer , combine radiation chemotherapy prevents recurrences many patient , improve survival . While combined cisplatin radiation cetuximab radiation effective radiation alone , approximately 50 % patient still recur . A aggressive approach may need patient prevent recurrence death . The strategy use multiple chemotherapy drug radiation give twice day test Mount Sinai University Chicago . Approximately 80 % patient cure strategy . While cure rate higher standard chemotherapy radiation treatment tolerable , side effect treatment common . We propose replace chemotherapy drug less toxic , target therapy call cetuximab . Our goal reduce toxicity maintain improving cure rate patient .</brief_summary>
