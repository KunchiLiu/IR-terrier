	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , alemtuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . A peripheral stem cell transplant use stem cell patient donor may replace patient 's immune cell destroy chemotherapy . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give fludarabine together alemtuzumab cyclophosphamide follow peripheral blood stem cell transplant alemtuzumab work treat patient advanced progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine Alemtuzumab Cyclophosphamide Followed Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant Alemtuzumab Treating Patients With Advanced Progressive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity induction therapy comprise fludarabine phosphate either alemtuzumab cyclophosphamide follow peripheral blood stem cell transplantation alemtuzumab patient advanced progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine length survival , event-free survival , disease-free survival patient treat regimen . - Evaluate relationship different clinical biological disease characteristic , therapeutic response , survival . OUTLINE : This pilot , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord biological risk profile ( high v low risk ) . - Group 1 ( high-risk patient ) : - Induction therapy : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV alemtuzumab IV day 1-3 . Treatment repeat 4 course . Patients response ( good clinical partial response , steady disease , progressive disease ) induction therapy remove study . Other patient proceed post-induction therapy base response induction therapy . - Post-induction therapy : - Complete clinical , cytometric , molecular response : Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) mobilization cytarabine IV twice daily day 1-3 filgrastim ( G-CSF ) follow therapy . - Response induction therapy evidence residual disease ( complete clinical cytometric response molecular evidence disease ; complete clinical response ; good clinical partial response ) : Patients without HLA familial match donor undergo PBSC mobilization cytarabine IV twice daily day 1-3 G-CSF . Patients sufficient harvest autologous PBSCs undergo autologous PBSC transplantation ( BEAM condition regimen [ carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ] ) . Patients without sufficient harvest - PBSCs receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly 6 week . Patients achieve molecular remission 6 week alemtuzumab receive 6 additional week treatment . Patients HLA familial match - undergo reduced-intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , fludarabine phosphate condition regimen ) . - Group 2 ( low-risk patient ) : - Induction therapy : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate cyclophosphamide day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every month 4 course . Patients achieve least partial response receive 2 additional course . Patients achieve complete clinical response cytometric molecular response ; complete clinical response cytometric response ; complete clinical response completion induction therapy ( i.e. , partial response great ) receive treatment . Patients response disease progression proceed post-induction therapy . - Post-induction therapy : Patients receive alemtuzumab SC weekly 6 week . Patients achieve complete remission 6 week alemtuzumab receive 6 additional week treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
