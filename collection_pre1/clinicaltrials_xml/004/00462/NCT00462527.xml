	<brief_summary>Acute renal failure ( ARF ) rare serious complication gastroenteritis dehydration , common reason pediatric emergency visit . Renal function determine glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Serum creatinine , current marker GFR , insensitive late marker ARF . Unfortunately , `` gold standard '' method measurement GFR impractical emergency set . Recently , cystatin C ( CysC ) introduce superior marker measurement GFR , particularly child . A single random blood sample allow accurate determination GFR so-called `` creatinine-blind '' range independent body composition . There grow evidence determination serum CysC concentration detect ARF adult earlier serum creatinine urinary fractional sodium excretion . No study examine marker early detection ARF child risk . We therefore propose prospective study compare CysC biomarkers renal dysfunction early detection ARF child dehydration due gastroenteritis . Patients minor trauma minimal likelihood ARF serve control . This study may establish CysC accurate cost-effective marker identify patient risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cystatin C Marker Detecting Early Renal Dysfunction Pediatric Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Rationale hypothesis : Acute renal failure relatively rare serious illness child . Early detection important prevent life threaten complication arise acute renal failure . Presently , method determine renal function either cumbersome , invasion unreliable used child . Current evidence show serum cystatin C precise cost-effective determine renal function . Our objective compare serum cystatin C biomarkers early diagnostic detection renal dysfunction child acute renal failure emergency setting . - Study design method : This prospective double cohort control study compare serum creatinine serum cystatin C detect early renal dysfunction child present emergency department . The study conduct CHEO emergency department . A study nurse identify eligible patient discuss whether approach family either bedside nurse attend physician meeting . Interested family give explanation study . Once write consent obtain , copy give family . Additional test request blood urine sample patient . Only patient already require intravenous needle eligible study . No additional needling therefore need part study . Urine sample obtain bad voiding sample . No catheter urine sample request part study . - Subject selection : Our target population patient present CHEO emergency department diagnose gastroenteritis dehydration , require intravenous rehydration . Our control group patient traumatic injury require conscious sedation intravenous access . We exclude patient know underlying kidney disease , renal transplantation , thyroid dysfunction , chronic systematic steroid us , genitourinary trauma patient transfer another hospital ongoing assessment treatment . - Specify number participant draw CHEO centre : CHEO designate centre study . 464 patient recruit complete study , 232 arm . - Delineate outcome measure analyze : The primary outcome measure compare sensitivity time detect early renal dysfunction use either serum creatinine serum cystatin C paediatric emergency set . Our secondary outcome measure compare serum cystatin C surrogate renal marker acute renal failure . Other renal marker include calculate Schwartz glomerular filtration rate , urine microprotein excretion , fractional excretion sodium urea , serum sodium , chloride , bicarbonate , urine Na/K ratio regular urinalysis . Additional analysis conduct comparison fractional excretion urea fractional excretion sodium earlier marker dehydration child . - Anticipated benefits/harms address : Only patient already require needle part hospital care eligible study . No additional needling therefore request . Additional test request would otherwise part routine care patient . It therefore possible kidney disorder identify child yet diagnose disease . We discuss possibility family enrollment patient . All major abnormality follow attend physician principle investigator study appropriate care apply . We intervene ongoing care patient patient remain hospital . The study terminate patient discharge hospital . - Data field ( ) abstract patient 's health record : We record patient 's CHEO medical record number purpose retrieve laboratory data ; date birth ; biometric measurement ( height , weight sex ) . No identifiable information record data sheet . No individual information use publication presentation . Informed consent document advertisement notice must append application . Both English French version consent form information sheet enclose application .</detailed_description>
