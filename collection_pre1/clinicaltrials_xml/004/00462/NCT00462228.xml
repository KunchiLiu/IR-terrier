	<brief_title>Effect Namenda Short Term Memory Attention Patients With Mild Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background significance : Each year United States approximately 1.5 million people sustain traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) approximately 80-90,000 result long-term lifelong disability . An estimated 5.3 million people currently live disability due TBI . The Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) estimate 75 % ( 1.1 million ) report TBIs concussion form mild TBIs ( MTBI ) . However , incidence MTBI vastly underestimate accord CDC Report Congress . The long term problem associate MTBI primarily memory impairment . Memory impairment result form MTBI likely improve time beyond initial stabilizing period one year post-injury . Dementia Alzheimer 's Disease produce cognitive problem similar experience patient mild moderate traumatic brain injury . The efficacy Namenda treatment cognitive problem due Alzheimer 's Dementia suggest may efficacy treatment short term memory attention deficit patient mild moderate traumatic brain injury . Overall Design Plan Study : Twenty post-TBI patient whose TBI occur least 1 year prior begin study recruit pilot study . Patients meet screen criterion cognitive ability assess baseline subsequent visit take Namenda placebo . Patients randomly assign begin either Namenda placebo crossover alternate treatment . Each patient participate study total 32 34 week . Patients complete study 10 total visit 6 visit cognitive test battery administer . This include 24 week study drug treatment ( 12 week Namenda 12 week placebo ) two 4-week washout period . Patients titrate 20 mg Namenda per day . Namenda placebo provide Forest Laboratories Inc. Cognitive screen criterion include Galveston Orientation Amnesia Test ( GOAT ) score least 75 , either Mini-Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) score 20 27 obtain screen visit , California Verbal Learning Test ( CVLT ) total score trial 1-5 one standard deviation low age match normative score . The CVLT score inclusion may obtain medical record provide CVLT test occur one year post TBI within two year study entry . The cognitive test battery measurement make first baseline Namenda placebo administration ( week 0 ) , week 6 , &amp; 12 Namenda placebo administration . After washout 4 week , second baseline ( week 16 ) assess , cognitive test battery administer week 22 &amp; 28 Namenda placebo administration . The cognitive test battery use assess efficacy utilize following test ; Verbal Memory : Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised ( HVLT-R ) . Visual Memory : Brief VisuoSpatial Memory Test Revised ( BVMT-R ) . Speed processing : Trail Making Test Part A . Attention : Trail Making Test Part B. Memory/processing speed : Symbol Digit Modality Test ( SDMT ) . The primary endpoint cognitive assessment HVLT-R BVMT-R . The 6 different form HVLT-R BVMT-R administer 6 cognitive test battery assessment . The sequence form administer randomize . The listed cognitive test consider secondary endpoint . An additional secondary efficacy endpoint Physicians Global Impression Change record visit frequency cognitive test . In addition neuropsychological test , patient physical examination , electrocardiogram , laboratory test blood urine . Safety tolerability monitor clinical assessment , report adverse event , laboratory value . Patient health assess clinic visit every 3-6 week throughout study . Serum pregnancy ( female child bear potential ) complete screening week 12 28 . Urine pregnancy test complete baseline ( week 0 ) week 16 &amp; 32 . A Safety Officer utilize primary mean monitor safety study . The Safety Officer physician associate study capacity . The Safety Officer give periodic report clinical assessment , laboratory value , adverse event .</detailed_description>
