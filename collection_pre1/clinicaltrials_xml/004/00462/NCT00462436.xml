	<brief_summary>Background : Treatment target cardiac risk factor reduction meet . Therefore , need new strategy assist patient meet goal . Objective : To determine amount additional benefit risk factor reduction associate consumption `` dietary portfolio '' ( low fat diet soy , nuts viscous fibre ) , achieve medical management diabetic patient follow cardiac surgery . Description : 35 cardiac surgery patient diabetes instructed incorporate dietary portfolio food diet four week . Changes blood cholesterol , marker inflammation , blood sugar control modifiable risk factor assess 2 4 week therapy . Relevance : Maximizing cardiac risk factor reduction combine approach ( dietary plus medication ) improve outcome , reduce rate re-hospitalization improve quality life diabetic patient heart surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : The consumption dietary portfolio find successfully reduce LDL cholesterol 30 % hyperlipidemic , non-diabetic patient highly controlled condition . Given burden cardiovascular disease diabetic population , important evaluate whether consumption dietary portfolio reduce modifiable risk factor improve diabetic control associate medical therapy alone population . The reduction modifiable risk factor , particularly diabetic patient coronary artery disease , improve long-term outcome thereby reduce re-admissions subsequently burden diabetic patient health care system , also improve quality life patient . This pilot project determine efficacy , feasibility tolerability aggressive dietary strategy , dietary portfolio functional food reduce cardiovascular risk factor diabetic patient follow CABG . Study Objectives : This study determine extent self select `` modify '' dietary portfolio ( without sterol ) together statin therapy : - reduce total LDL cholesterol - increase endothelial cell number function reduce CRP level . - reduce marker inflammation insulin resistance - study also determine tolerability compliance portfolio diet Primary Hypothesis : The consumption modify dietary portfolio pleiotropic effect current statin therapy result additional reduction LDL cholesterol 25 % four week treatment . Secondary Hypotheses : The addition dietary portfolio together statin therapy : - significantly increase measure endothelial function endothelial progenitor cell count - significantly reduce CRP level - feasible well tolerated bypass patient - result compliance rate 70 % main component diet - significantly improve plasma total-C : HDL-C ratio , total-C , HDL-C , apolipoproteins A-I B level two four week treatment - significantly reduce marker inflammation four week ( CRP , IL-6 TNF ) - improve index glycemic control ( HOMA ) , oxidize LDL LDL particle size Trial Design : Subject Selection : Participants screen patient return routine six week follow-up visit follow coronary artery bypass graft surgery . Eligible patient invited participate secondary prevention trial surgeon . The six week time point recruitment allow direct patient interaction also ensure sufficient time pass normalization lipid profile post CABG ( 20 ) . Finally , time , patient also see cardiologist medication regimen adjust follow surgery , allow window stable medical care course study . Patients type II diabetes select study 1 ) group patient high risk develop post-operative complication therefore likely receive maximal benefit risk factor modification , 2 ) group increase cardiovascular risk therefore benefit multiple level addition portfolio diet include , limited reduce LDL cholesterol , blood pressure , CRP inflammatory response also improve insulin sensitivity endothelial function . Finally since estrogen level influence endothelial function , pre-menopausal woman exclude pilot study . Study Design : This non-randomized pilot study investigate magnitude cardiovascular risk reduction achieve addition `` modified portfolio diet '' ( DPF ) ( without plant sterol ) consume one month real life condition diabetic patient statin therapy know cardiovascular disease . The four week intervention period previously find sufficient significant change primary outcome variable ( LDL cholesterol ) occur short enough minimize confound effect change medication physical activity hypercholesterolemic subject statin therapy ( 21 ) . The study involve one baseline two follow-up visit ( Figure 1 ) . At baseline , demographic , anthropometric ( weight , height , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist/hip ratio ) medical/cardiac history obtain include detailed list current medication . Resting blood pressure measure ( see analytic method ) . Information regard exercise smoking habit also obtain time . Participants receive comprehensive dietary advice train registered dietitian Risk Factor Modification Centre . The DPF group conform current therapeutic diet appropriate hypercholesterolemic subject ( &lt; 7 % energy saturate fat , &lt; 200 mg/d cholesterol ) addition combination viscous fiber , soy protein almonds . Participants instruct select follow diet provide sample appropriate food assist initial selection compliance DPF . All participant receive weekly allowance purchase appropriate food . The portfolio diet plan include food contribute 8 g/1000 kcal viscous fiber Î²-glucan ( oat , barley , oat bran bread soup ) psyllium ( cereal ) , 17 g soy protein/1000 kcal ( soy burger , hot dog , link , meat analogue , milk , yogurt cheese ) 22 g nut ( almond ) /1000 kcal . Participants Risk Factor Modification Centre maintain level fiber intake 4-month period ( 22 ) . Moderate weight loss ( 0.5kg/week ) BMI &gt; 25 routine physical activity use guideline Guide Cardiac surgery encourage part secondary prevention strategy . During baseline visit , coordinator ( MSc student ) complete 24 hour dietary recall obtain idea estimate dietary intake . This recall together calculate energy requirement use establish equation use assess individual energy intake . Using estimate , coordinator advise participant incorporate DPF eating pattern . The coordinator instruct patient detailed diet history recording , participant provide printed booklet record food item approximate size . Since determine compliance important end-point , self-taring scale provide assist accuracy . Subjects ask complete daily checklist consumption three key food food component portfolio diet ( 23,24 ) . Assessment checklist three key dietary component provide estimate compliance also assist patient monitor daily basis many food portfolio consume . The coordinator complete 4 random 24 hour recall study subject , use standardize technique , throughout study period order validate compliance checklist data . Recall data analyze use program base USDA data ( 25 ) additional data food analyze laboratory protein , total fat , dietary fiber use method Association Official Analytical Chemists ( AOAC ) ( 26 ) well table Anderson Bridges ( 27 ) . Since DPF part comprehensive secondary prevention strategy , participant encourage follow guideline physical activity ( 30 minute , 3-5 time per week ) outline Guide Cardiac Surgery Outpatient Handbook . The amount physical activity record use pedometer record bottom food checklist . Fasting blood sample collect primary secondary marker cardiovascular risk , insulin resistance endothelial function . Brachial artery vasoreactivity complete time day participant fasting condition . Medications hold morning test . Significance Proposal : This study determine magnitude additional cardiovascular risk reduction associate consumption `` modify dietary portfolio '' diabetic patient coronary artery disease statin therapy . Furthermore , since dietary portfolio aggressive strategy , study also determine feasibility tolerability type intervention patient live community . Finally , study may justify large secondary prevention trial look effect intervention cardiac outcomes rate re-hospitalization follow bypass graft . Aggressive , innovative , patient driven dietary strategy may complement medical management improve ability patient meet treatment target ultimately result improve patient outcome quality life follow bypass graft surgery .</detailed_description>
