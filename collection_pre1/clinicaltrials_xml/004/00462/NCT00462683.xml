	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate state bone health brain injury patient see within rehabilitation set . Osteopenia condition bone decrease calcification , decrease density , reduce mass occurs . Osteoporosis disease bone become extremely porous , subject fracture , heal slowly . More specifically , prevalence osteopenia osteoporosis specific anatomic location ( e.g. , forearm , hip , spine ) determine specific intervention ( e.g. , use vitamin , nutritional supplement , specific prescription medication ) people brain injury may apply , apply , manage bone health . An attempt also make evaluate severity brain injury , base loss muscle strength/function , compare data bone-focused information bone mineral density ( BMD ) , fall , history .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Outcomes : As study control comparator group , goal provide descriptive data regard prevalence osteopenia osteoporosis anatomic site evaluate DEXA specialized population ( BMD outcome measure ) . Additionally , use bone-specific intervention ( vitamin , nutritional supplement , medication ) , previous diagnostic testing ( DEXA ) history fall fracture assess determine extent bone health consider evaluated population individual increase risk fracture . Secondary Outcomes : Functional status measure also obtain enable correlation bone data . This study involve cross-sectional , descriptive evaluation cohort 225 patient brain injury manage out-patient clinic physician RIC . The goal study provide representative data general bone health population patient ( degree , extent localization bone loss ) well intervention may implement manage bone health ( vitamin , nutritional supplement , prescription medication ) . After obtain informed consent , patient wish involve ask complete medical history questionnaire focus bone health undergo measurement bone density DEXA ( dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) . At time DEXA examination , muscle strength evaluate trained research coordinator . A dietary history blood sample also obtain , latter storage order later measure vitamin D level and/or bone marker . All subject give opportunity continue longitudinal arm study ( second phase ) . Those sign informed consent re-evaluated yearly interval set data obtain . Descriptive Data Obtained : 1 . Demographics : date birth , sex , race , ethnicity 2 . Detailed complete medical history , particular focus : - Information regard brain injury : time occurrence , motor/sensory , etc . - Bone specific information : history fall , fracture , use medication , smoking , alcohol , family history osteoporosis fracture , previous DEXA , etc . - Questionnaire functional status : use affect arm , ambulation , assistive device , orthotic , frequency spasm . - Evaluation motor status use Motor Components NIH Stroke Scale ( item 4 - 7 ) 3 . Dietary history Study procedure : 1 . DEXA evaluation . Specific measurement make lumbar spine , hip distal radius ; lateral vertebral assessment obtain possible . Biological Samples : 1 . Two 10ml tube blood obtain participant . Serum separate frozen two aliquot save possible measurement vitamin D level ( 25OH vitamin D ) and/or bone marker .</detailed_description>
