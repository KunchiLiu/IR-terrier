	<brief_title>VEGF Trap Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess activity VEGF Trap patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer , term frequency patient progression-free survival least 6 month initiate therapy objective tumor response . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive VEGF Trap IV 1 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
