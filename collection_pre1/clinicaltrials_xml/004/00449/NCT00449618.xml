	<brief_summary>Aspirin ( ASA ) show provide mark benefit prevention cardiovascular event , although potential direct effect ASA cardiovascular function remain uncertain . Previous study demonstrate ASA potent antioxidative agent markedly reduce vascular production superoxide normotensive hypertensive rat . In addition , ASA find prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension cardiovascular hypertrophy , mainly antioxidative property prevent generation superoxide , although ASA apparently appear reduce hypertensive level blood pressure ( BP ) . Moreover , recent result demonstrate ASA induces nitric oxide ( NO ) release vascular endothelium . No attention pay , far , potential administration time-dependent effect study . Previous laboratory animal clinical trial research convincingly demonstrate administration time-dependent ( reference circadian rhythm ) effect ASA . Thus , effect ASA upon lipoperoxides , β-adrenergic receptor , BP clinically healthy subject depend circadian timing ASA administration . Most important , administration time-dependent influence ASA BP previously demonstrate randomized trial healthy woman independent , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial . The first conduct clinically healthy subject , second one normotensive hypertensive subject , third one pregnant woman high risk preeclampsia fourth one previously untreated patient mild hypertension . The finding BP study consistent ; BP-lowering effect low-dose ASA achieve administered bedtime upon awaken . In keep chronopharmacological effect ASA previous finding suggest ASA low dose may potential beneficial effect BP , prospective , randomize , double-blind , crossover study investigate potential influence ASA BP subject either high-normal BP diagnosis mild ( grade 1 ) hypertension . The subject receive low-dose ASA placebo different time day accord rest-activity cycle , evaluate 48-hour ambulatory BP monitoring 6 week pharmacologic intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-center , prospective , randomize , four-arm , crossover study double-blind design . At Visit 1 ( week -1 ) patient assess eligibility study participation . Subjects advise study entry fully determine completion screen period exclusion/inclusion criterion entirely assess . Subjects perform Visit 2 soon laboratory result Visit 1 available . At baseline ( Visit 2/Day 1 ) , total 300 subject whose eligibility confirm randomized 1:1:1 ratio one treatment group ( aspirin upon awaken , aspirin bedtime , placebo -- half awakening , half bedtime ) . Subjects start first double-blind treatment phase total duration 6 week . During period subject receive either aspirin 100 mg placebo two different circadian time ( either awaken nighttime sleep bedtime ) end study phase ( Visit 3 ) . After first treatment phase , subject undergo 2-week wash-out phase placebo . At Visit 4 ( week 8 ) , subject crossed-over term circadian time , keep original treatment ( either aspirin placebo ) , follow second treatment phase 6 week . The study duration include phase 15 week . Safety efficacy assess end every treatment phase , i.e. , Visits 3 5 . Safety also assess phone call 2 week initiation active treatment phase ( week 2 10 ) . Subjects may request attend clinic evaluation week present adverse effect .</detailed_description>
