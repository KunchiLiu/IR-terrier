	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness investigational vaccine ( TG4040 ) prevent hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . The primary goal study determine safety increase dos TG4040 versus placebo ( inactive substance ) subject chronically infect HCV . Approximately 85 patient , age 18-65 year , chronic HCV infection enrol study two site , Saint Louis University Cincinnati Children 's Hospital . Volunteers receive dos TG4040 placebo injection thigh different day , depend study group belong . Safety check dos increase , participant receive study vaccine , TG4040 , point study . Each subject participate study 8 month . This study may help produce new vaccine would improve control HCV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess safety , immunogenicity , efficacy hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) vaccine , TG4040 , outpatients chronic hepatitis C. The study conduct two part two DMID Vaccine Treatment Evaluation Unit ( VTEU ) Centers : Saint Louis University Cincinnati Children 's Hospital . Up 85 subject chronic hepatitis C receive test vaccine via subcutaneous injection thigh . In Part I study , 18 subject randomize 1 3 group . At initial dose time point , Group One receive 10 6th power particle-forming unit ( PFU ) Groups Two &amp; Three receive saline placebo 3 dos Days 0 , 7 , 14 . After Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) review , Group Two receive high dose TG4040 ( 10 7th power PFU ) Groups One &amp; Three receive saline placebo . After SMC review , Group Three receive high dose TG4040 ( 10 8th power PFU ) Groups One &amp; Two receive saline placebo . ( Each subject therefore treat one course TG4040 receive two course placebo ) . In Part II study , 60 subject ( 30 non-responders relapse subjects-Part IIa , 30 treatment naïve , Part IIb ) randomize two group receive either 10 8th power PFU ( high tolerate dose ) TG4040 saline placebo two dosing time point crossover design . ( Each subject therefore vaccinate dose TG4040 also receive course placebo . ) Subjects enrol either Part I Part II study participate 8 month . The primary objective Part I study assess safety escalate dos TG4040 versus placebo administer non-responders relapse subject chronic hepatitis C. The secondary objective Part I study assess immunogenicity escalate dos TG4040 versus placebo administer non-responders relapse subject chronic hepatitis C. The primary safety objective Part II study ass safety dose TG4040 select Part I versus placebo administer subject chronic hepatitis C , either non-responders relapse subject treatment- naïve subject . The primary efficacy objective Part II study assess antiviral activity HCV TG4040 versus placebo subject chronic hepatitis C , non-responders relapse subject treatment-naïve subject , assess 1 log reduction serum level HCV RNA . The secondary objective Part II study ass immunogenicity TG4040 versus placebo subject chronic hepatitis C , non-responders relapse subject treatment-naïve subject , correlate reduction serum level HCV RNA . For Part I , primary outcome measure relate safety include measure reactogenicity , change blood count hepatic panel . For Part II , primary outcome variable change serum level HCV RNA compare baseline . A decrease 1 log baseline consider significant effect . In addition , primary outcome measure also include safety include measure reactogenicity , change blood count hepatic panel . Secondary outcome measure include test aim assess immunogenicity vaccine candidate include , limited , development anti-HCV use standard commercial assay research assay , develop enhance vitro T cell reactivity stimulate HCV antigen .</detailed_description>
