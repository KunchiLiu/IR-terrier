	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine usefulness HyperQ™ System improve positive predictive value conventional ECG stress test . Patients refer stress test perform ECG stress test treadmill , high-frequency ECG record conventional 12 lead use BSP 's HyperQ™ System . Conventional 12 lead ECG , well HyperQ™ recording provide HyperQ™ System . The result conventional test HyperQ™ data compare , use one three cardiac test ( stress echocardiography , SPECT myocardial perfusion image angiography ) gold standard . Statistical analysis compare sensitivity , specificity , PPV NPV conventional HyperQ™ stress ECG detect myocardial ischemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Diagnostic Benefits HyperQTM System ECG Stress Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population comprise 1200 patient refer stress test three Maccabi clinic cardiac medical center . All patient perform ECG stress test high-frequency ECG record conventional 12 lead use BSP 's HyperQ™ System . The record do without affect interfere aspect normal due course test . Standard Bruce protocol modify Bruce protocol use , standard test termination indication . Two minute rest ECG record prior state protocol . Following test , physician interpret test 's result conventional manner ( e.g . ST change , chest pain , etc ) decide whether subject refer additional test . HyperQ™ data analyze two phase : ( ) Interpretation physician non-blinded manner one day follow stress test ( ii ) perform exercise test study group , blindly conventional diagnosis HyperQ™ analysis do previously , well outcomes image procedure . The first HyperQ™ reading use detect subject positive accord HyperQ™ system negative accord conventional stress test . These subject refer physician clinical investigation . The first reading also use assess physician 's interpretation scenario represent realistic clinical setting , second reading use examine unbiased clinical benefit HyperQ™ data .</detailed_description>
