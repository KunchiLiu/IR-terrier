	<brief_title>TMC207-TiDP13-C208 : Anti-bacterial Activity , Safety , Tolerability TMC207 Participants With Multi-drug Resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial conduct 2 consecutive stage , exploratory ( investigative ) stage ( Stage 1 ) proof effectiveness stage ( Stage 2 ) . During Stage 1 , panel 50 participant randomize ( participant assign different treatment base chance ) receive either TMC207 placebo 8 week top BR . In Stage 2 , another panel 150 participant randomize receive either TMC207 placebo 24 week top BR . TMC207 dose 400 mg every day first 2 week , 200 mg 3 times/week follow 6 22 week Stages 1 2 , respectively . When participant Stage 1 complete 8 week double-blind ( neither theparticipant physician know whether drug placebo take , dosage ) treatment TMC207 placebo ( discontinue earlier ) , primary Stage 1 analysis perform data first 8 week treatment . Following Stage 1 analysis , Stage 2 initiate panel 150 new participant enrol . After double-blind treatment phase Stage 1 Stage 2 , participant continue receive MDR-TB treatment per national treatment guideline . They follow safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , microbiological efficacy 96 week receive last dose TMC207 placebo . The Data Safety Monitoring Board Committee review data regular basis . The DSMB/DSMC group expert tuberculosis clinical trial conduct commercial interest development TMC207 company ( Tibotec , BVBA ) develop new TB drug .</detailed_description>
