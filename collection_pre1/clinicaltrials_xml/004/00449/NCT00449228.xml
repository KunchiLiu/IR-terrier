	<brief_summary>We propose evaluate preoperative education patient new surgical technique ( mini-invasive THR ) could reduce time achieve functional independence . The primary objective trial ass time reach functional independence total hip replacement depend treatment group : preoperative education versus preoperative education mini-invasive procedure versus standard procedure . The study hypothesis education mini-invasive procedure reduce time reach functional independence . This prospective trial double randomization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose evaluate preoperative education patient new surgical technique ( mini-invasive THR ) could reduce time achieve functional independence . Preoperative education compare education mini-invasive surgery compare standard group . The education base explain patient postoperative rehabilitation like . The mini-invasive THR base minimisation soft tissue trauma . It require specific instrumentation allow dissection implantation prosthesis . Only study evaluate technique . However , study retrospective non-randomised result contradictory . Therefore , randomise control clinical trial necessary evaluate possible benefit feasibility technique . The primary outcome time reach functional independence . Secondary outcome evaluate duration hospital stay , quality implantation prosthesis , postoperative morbidity , functional benefit quality life . Methods : monocentric randomise controlled clinical trial compare preoperative education versus preoperative education ( first randomization ) conventional THR mini-invasive THR ( second randomization ) . One hundred forty patient include group . Expected result : preoperative education mini-invasive THR prone decrease time functional independence , postoperative morbidity duration hospital stay .</detailed_description>
