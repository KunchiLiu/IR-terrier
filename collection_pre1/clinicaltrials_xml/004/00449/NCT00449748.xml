	<brief_title>Everolimus ( RAD001 ) Therapy Patients With Systemic Mastocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RAD001 design stop cancer cell multiply . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , may cause tumor cell die . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . They perform within 2 week start study , unless list otherwise . You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able child . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . You need `` fast '' 6 hour blood test perform . This mean able food drink ( except water ) time . Also part screen test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) test measure electrical activity heart ) . You bone marrow biopsy aspiration within 3 month start study ( within 2 week start study , receive treatment SM ) . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . The bone marrow sample use check status disease , also routine test see mutation ( change ) certain gene . If doctor feel necessary , may need additional screening test ( bone scan ) check status disease . If find eligible take part study , receive first supply RAD001 . You take 1-2 pill RAD001 mouth day study . During 3 hour dose RAD001 , must eat light fat-free meal ( salad dressing , bowl cereal skim milk ) . You also try keep dietary habit consistent dose . This mean eat time , amount food time . Each `` cycle '' RAD001 last 1 month . You study visit Day 1 Cycles 1 , 2 , 3 . At visit , receive new supply RAD001 . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You ask side effect may . While study , must take additional medication ( include over-the-counter product ) without ask study doctor first . At study visit , ask take additional medication . You also ask non-drug therapy blood transfusion . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Like screen , need fast 6 hour blood test perform . Halfway cycle ( begin Week 3 cycle ) , blood drawn routine test . This 2 tablespoon blood time . You need fast 6 hour blood test perform . It choice whether blood test perform M.D . Anderson outside laboratory . On Day 1 Cycle 4 , another study visit . You test perform study visit Day 1 Cycles 1 , 2 , 3 . You also bone marrow aspirate biopsy order check status disease . If bone marrow sample collect time screening show mutation certain gene , bone marrow sample collect time study ( routine test ) . If test result show disease respond time , take study . If disease respond Day 1 Cycle 4 ( certain sign symptom related SM improve ) , continue take RAD001 long benefit . You continue blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test every week . You also continue study visit ( test perform Day 1 Cycle 4 ) , visit every 3 month . In word , return Day 1 Cycles 4 , 7 , 10 , . On Day 1 month study visit ( Cycles 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , ) , call telephone research staff . During phone call , ask side effect may . You also ask result study-related blood test since last phone call study visit . If disease get bad , begin another therapy cancer , intolerable side effect occur , take study . This investigational study . RAD001 Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve commercially available . It authorize use research . Up 25 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
