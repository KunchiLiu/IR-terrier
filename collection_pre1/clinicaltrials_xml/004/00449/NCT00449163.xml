	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , floxuridine , leucovorin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab work treat patient stage IV colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether irinotecan hydrochloride , floxuridine , leucovorin calcium , bevacizumab improve overall survival patient stage IV colorectal cancer . Secondary - Estimate response rate ( complete response partial response ) , time response , progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Estimate resectability rate patient treat regimen . - Evaluate safety toxicity regimen . - Assess quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 22 irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 24 hour , high-dose floxuridine IV 24 hour day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients evaluated completion every 2 course therapy . Patients whose disease deem operable evaluation refer surgery . Patients complete quality life assessment baseline , every 6 week study treatment , periodically follow-up . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
