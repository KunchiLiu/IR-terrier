	<brief_summary>The current goal antiretroviral therapy use potent regimen suppress plasma viral load maintain suppression long possible . However , patient treat potent regimen , several problem limit long term effectiveness contribute incomplete viral suppression . These problem include poor tolerability , metabolic toxic effect . In order avoid common problem toxicity might interested simplify treatment few toxicity , low pill burden . In study evaluate safety efficacy simplification treatment TRIZIVIR long term Boosted PI NNRTI contain regimen first line therapy .</brief_summary>
