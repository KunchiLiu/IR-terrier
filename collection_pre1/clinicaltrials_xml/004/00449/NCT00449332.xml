	<brief_title>Early Indicators Chronic Rejection Lung Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung transplant recipient routinely follow clinic every three month first year post-transplant . Spirometry measurement FEV1 , FVC FEF25-75 obtain visit . In addition , lung transplant recipient undergo surveillance bronchoscopy one , three , six , nine twelve month . All bronchoscopy specimen obtain study obtain bronchoscopies schedule per physician caring patient . An extra 90 cc sterile solution instill bronchus two extra transbronchial biopsy perform addition routine bronchoscopic procedure . Routinely , 4-8 transbronchial biopsy sample obtain transplanted lung . Two specimen randomly select study rest undergo routine histopathologic study . The study biopsy set aside process . The study visit research occur time standard care post transplant visit . We collect subject 's history , demographic subject 's transplant data , donor procurement information , physical exam information , pregnancy test , blood test spirometry result visit mention .</detailed_description>
