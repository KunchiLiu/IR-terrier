	<detailed_description>Quitting smoking appear single effective intervention treatment reduce mortality patient Coronary Heart Disease ( CHD ) . However , despite intervention , almost two-thirds smoker resume smoke year hospitalization CHD related illness ; one-third resume smoking within one month . A critical challenge institution-level program provide consistent patient follow-up linkage community-based smoking cessation resource . Interactive voice response ( IVR ) technology potential improve follow-up smoker hospitalization enhance triage clinical support smoke cessation . IVR use natural language place automate out-going call pose question regard smoking status progress smoke cessation , drop database . A counselor able link database obtain information patient 's smoke cessation need provide support appropriate . A randomized control trial ( RCT ) plan evaluate whether IVR system follow-up triage help smoker hospitalize CHD , quit smoke 26- 52-week follow-up period . Participants randomize either Usual Care IVR group . Both group receive in-patient counseling offer nicotine replacement therapy . The IVR group additionally receive telephone call IVR system three , 14 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 day hospital discharge . Variables assess 26 52 week include : smoking status , 7-day point-prevalent continuous abstinence , well self-efficacy smoking cessation , use effective cessation resource patient satisfaction ( 26 week ) .</detailed_description>
