	<detailed_description>Abnormal repetitive behavior ( odd inappropriate movement , self-injury , compulsion ) among aberrant behavior exhibit individual mental retardation . However , little known pathobiology treatment largely unconfirmed control trial . For example , control study examine efficacy pharmacological treatment abnormal repetitive behavior individual mental retardation . This trial part large project design elucidate neurobiological base repetitive behavior disorder develop rational , safe , effective pharmacological treatment . Thus far , project establish pathophysiological basis stereotype behavior disorder , demonstrate role central dopamine deficiency stereotype behavior disorder , provide evidence efficacy 5-HT uptake inhibitor atypical antipsychotic treat stereotype behavior . There currently little information guide clinician decide drug class may effective abnormal repetitive behavior individual . Moreover , little work attempt identify variable may predict differential treatment response . This trial ass relative efficacy SSRI atypical antipsychotic across multiple category abnormal repetitive behavior .</detailed_description>
