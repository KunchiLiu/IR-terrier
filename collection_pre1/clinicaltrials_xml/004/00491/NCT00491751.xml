	<brief_summary>This study seek determine whether non-invasive measure endothelial function utility surrogate marker cardiovascular risk patient peripheral arterial disease undergo vascular surgery . Measurements endothelial function make initiation atorvastatin , ascorbic acid , placebo therapy pre-operative period . We examine cardiovascular event follow surgery . We hypothesize patient improvement endothelial function increase cardiovascular risk compare patient improvement endothelial function .</brief_summary>
