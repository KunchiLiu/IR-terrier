	<brief_title>The Addition Cardiac CT Exercise Treadmill Testing Evaluation Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT-EXTRA randomize clinical trial compare novel diagnostic strategy employ addition coronary MSCT angiography exercise treadmill test standard diagnostic strategy exercise treadmill test outpatient evaluation low-intermediate risk patient possible angina . This first randomized clinical trial evaluate diagnostic strategy outpatient chest pain incorporates noninvasive assessment coronary artery function anatomy . CT- EXTRA determine whether coronary MSCT angiography add incremental prognostic value exercise treadmill test alone predict future adverse cardiac event reduce downstream clinical resource utilization . This study also evaluate impact strategy avoidance unnecessary invasive coronary angiography , statin aspirin prescription , patient anxiety , satisfaction diagnostic approach , motivation healthy behavioral change . Finally , economic analysis perform assess difference overall healthcare cost diagnostic approach . In today ’ manage care-dominated paradigm , paramount new diagnostic modality coronary MSCT angiography clinically effective cost effective well . CT EXTRA provide critical information clinicians health care administrator clinical cost effectiveness initial diagnostic strategy employ routine coronary MSCT angiography evaluation patient possible angina . 300 male female military health care beneficiary age 18-70 , low intermediate risk symptomatic coronary artery disease refer Walter Reed Cardiology Clinic exercise treadmill test evaluation possible angina ( chest pain angina-equivalent ) . This study randomize , non-blinded , prospective trial conduct Cardiology clinic Walter Reed Army Medical Center . Patients , age 18-70 year , refer Cardiology clinic exercise treadmill test outpatient evaluation possible angina low-intermediate risk symptomatic coronary artery disease , eligible . All patient meet aforementioned inclusion/exclusion criterion consent investigator randomize seal envelope either “ mandatory coronary MSCT angiography ” “ coronary MSCT angiography ” initiation exercise treadmill test . The randomization sequence generate use sequence computer-generated random number . All consented subject complete survey assess baseline depression use Beck Depression Inventory , anxiety use State Trait Anxiety Inventory , motivation healthy behavioral change use ladder scale questionnaire . Completion three questionnaire research purpose take approximately 15 minute . Exercise Treadmill Testing All subject undergo exercise treadmill test initially order refer physician . All exercise treadmill test conduct Cardiology clinic Walter Reed Army Medical Center accord standard clinic protocol . Testing conduct health care professional ( staff physician , fellow , nurse practitioner ) associate protocol . A Cardiology staff physician affiliate protocol officially interpret exercise treadmill test . Subjects perform grade exercise treadmill test accord Full Bruce protocol aim reach 85 % maximal predict heart rate age . According standard clinical practice , exercise treadmill test consider positive 0.1 mV new horizontal downsloping ST segment depression ST segment elevation 0.80 m beyond J point occur exercise recovery two contiguous lead . A nondiagnostic test define absence ischemic electrical change set reproduction chest pain symptom peak heart rate ≤85 % age-predicted maximal heart rate . An exercise treadmill test consider negative &gt; 85 % age-predicted maximal heart rate achieve reproduction anginal symptom development electrocardiographic ischemic change absent . In accordance standard clinical practice , exercise treadmill test prematurely terminate event lightheadedness , severe ST depression ( &gt; 2mm ) elevation ( &gt; 1mm ) , ventricular supraventricular arrhythmia , exaggerate blood pressure increase ( &gt; 250 mm Hg systolic &gt; 120mm Hg diastolic ) &gt; 10mm Hg decrease diastolic blood pressure . Upon completion exercise treadmill test , subject provide copy result official interpretation exercise treadmill test inclusion medical record . A copy exercise treadmill test result keep subject ’ file investigational team . Completion exercise treadmill test generally take 25 minute . Immediately Following Exercise Treadmill Testing All consent subject follow exercise treadmill test undergo initial laboratory assessment include fast lipid panel ( LDL-C , HDL-C , triglyceride ) , C-reactive protein , fast blood glucose , creatinine , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) urine pregnancy test ( female ) . Approximately 15 mL ( 3 teaspoon ) blood drawn central laboratory , clinical laboratory Walter Reed Army Medical Center . Excess blood discard central laboratory accord standard protocol . All laboratory value process central laboratory . Subjects assign “ coronary MSCT angiography ” arm follow refer physician evaluation . Additional selection testing , consultation , choice therapy discretion refer physician . Coronary CT angiography available group subject . Otherwise , protocol predetermine clinical diagnostic treatment course subject . This approach simulate previous standard care evaluation possible angina ( prior availability coronary CT angiography clinical practice ) . By exclude option coronary CT angiography group , possible incremental value test accurately assess . In event “ high risk ” exercise treadmill test , subject offer inpatient admission . High risk test include follow : occurrence sustain ventricular tachycardia , syncope , high risk Duke treadmill score ( &gt; -10 ) , limit angina stage 1 Full Bruce protocol , &gt; 2 mm ST depression 3 lead stage 1 Full Bruce protocol . Subjects high risk test assign “ coronary MSCT angiography ” arm encourage undergo invasive coronary angiography . Subjects assign “ mandatory coronary MSCT angiography ” arm undergo coronary MSCT angiography expedite manner . This follow invasive coronary angiography , warrant , 48 hour later . Because protocol excludes subject deem high pretest probability obstructive coronary artery disease , potential occurrence minimize . Patients assign “ mandatory coronary MSCT angiography ” arm schedule coronary MSCT angiography outpatient basis . The procedure coronary MSCT angiography described . After completion coronary MSCT angiography , result provide refer physician . Additional selection testing , consultation , therapy discretion refer physician . The protocol predetermine clinical course subject follow coronary MSCT angiography . Coronary MSCT angiography Pre-procedural Medications : In order obtain high quality compute tomographic image minimal motion artifact , goal heart rate ≤ 65 beat per minute . This usually require administration beta-blocker medication image acquisition . In addition , subject baseline low rate ( &gt; 65bpm ) generally need reduce dose beta-blockers blunt increase rate MSCT scan due anxiety reflex response contrast . The dose initial oral beta-blocker determine base rest heart rate time exercise treadmill test . For subject baseline heart rate 65bpm blood pressure 100/50 , 100-150mg short act metoprolol prescribe investigator . Subjects instructed ingest medication approximately one hour schedule outpatient MSCT scan . For subject heart rate 50bpm less 65bpm blood pressure 100/50 , 25-50 mg oral short act metoprolol prescribe investigator . Subjects instructed ingest medication approximately one hour schedule outpatient MSCT scan . For subject baseline heart rate &lt; 50bpm , metoprolol prescribe . On day MSCT scan upon arrival Radiology Department , subject receive peripheral upper extremity intravenous catheter , place certified nurse Radiology Department . The subject ’ baseline blood pressure heart rate record . For subject whose heart rate remain ≥ 65 beat per minute blood pressure ≥ 100/50 , intravenous metoprolol ( 5 mg aliquot every 2-5 minute close observation continuous telemetric monitoring , 40 mg total ) administer cardiology staff fellow . Once satisfactory heart rate blood pressure stability establish , subject undergo MSCT testing list . However , target heart rate achievable protocol , cause exclusion study , since feasibility accuracy study show diagnostic scan obtain many patient higher heart rate advance scanner . Nitroglycerin , coronary vasodilator , administer subject ( 0.8 mg sublingually ) approximately 1 minute initiation MSCT scan optimize image quality . Subjects query regard recent use ( within previous 72 hour ) medication erectile dysfunction ( Cialis , Levitra Viagra ) day MCST scan since drug interact nitroglycerin cause potential life-threatening hypotensive effect . On day schedule MSCT scan , subject admit take Cialis within past 72 hour Levitra / Viagra within past 48 hour allow undergo coronary MSCT angiography reschedule . Subjects instruct withhold medication least 3 day schedule scan . All female subject randomize MSCT arm require wear radioprotective bismuth shield actual MSCT scan . This radioprotective brassiere ( Cone Instruments Inc , Solen , Ohio ) compose neoprene bismuth trioxide study 16 slice CT scan show reduce breast radiation exposure approximately 40 % .25 The bra place directly breast female subject either female nurse technician Radiology Department . The adhesive strip undersurface radioprotective bra prevent slippage actual scan . Depending bust size subject , either medium large bra employ best fit . Each bra intend single patient use discard study . The effect bismuth shield image interpretation unknown . If image coronary artery deem unevaluable , woman 40 year younger exclude participation study . In event , woman great age 40 year enrol radioprotective shield use . Subject follow-up After completion initial testing ( exercise treadmill test +/- MSCT angiography ) , subject return refer physician dictate clinical management . The result exercise treadmill test coronary MSCT angiography ( applicable ) provide refer physician . Additional selection testing , consultation , choice therapy discretion refer physician . For subject assign “ coronary MSCT angiography ” arm , refer provider instruct make MSCT available option subject test deemed appropriate . Otherwise , protocol predetermine clinical diagnostic treatment course subject . This approach simulate actual clinical practice previous standard care ( prior availability MSCT ) allow assessment downstream clinical resource utilization unbiased fashion . Subjects follow total two year . During time , follow factor evaluate : - Status present syndrome include final diagnosis - Number cardiac visit outpatient physician emergency department ( ED ) chest pain/anginal equivalent - Cardiac hospitalization chest pain syndrome/angina equivalent - Requirement additional cardiac diagnostic testing , namely stress test ( nuclear , MRI , echocardiography ) and/or cardiac catheterization - Need additional radiographic test incidental finding find coronary MSCT - Need coronary revascularization procedure - Unstable angina , myocardial infarction cardiac death . Myocardial infarction define cardiac event require admission hospital development cardiac enzyme level elevation . Unstable angina define accelerate anginal symptom without ischemic electrocardiographic change require hospital admission coronary revascularization . Death attribute cardiac origin case document significant arrhythmia and/or cardiac arrest , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction . Moreover , unexplained death occur suddenly hospital ascribe cardiac cause . - Prescription antilipid antiplatelet therapy These factor determine electronic medical record review ( CHCS-II ) telephonic interview subject every 6 month total 2 year . Any visit outpatient clinic ED inpatient admission categorize “ cardiac ” present complaint chest pain identical original complaint prompt initial exercise treadmill test referral . Subjects return clinic 12 month complete questionnaire assess change depression , anxiety motivation healthy behavioral change use Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) ladder scale respectively . Subjects also survey current perception chest pain cardiac noncardiac utility index cardiovascular evaluation , provide insight etiology symptom . Endpoints Primary The primary outcome composite endpoint consist adverse cardiac event cardiac resource utilization . Specifically , include occurrence adverse cardiac event ( cardiac death , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary revascularization ) , utilization additional diagnostic test initial complaint , occurrence future clinical outpatient/inpatient/ED encounter initial cardiac complaint . Secondary Secondary endpoint include : 1 . Occurrence adverse cardiac event ( cardiac death , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary revascularization ) . 2 . Need subsequent cardiac diagnostic test initial complaint angina/angina equivalent 3 . Occurrence future clinical outpatient/inpatient/ED encounter initial cardiac complaint 4 . Avoidance unnecessary cardiac catheterization 5 . Change motivation healthy behavioral change , assess ladder motivational scale 6 . Change subject anxiety , assess State Trait Anxiety Inventory . 7 . Change subject depression , assess Beck Depression Inventory . 8 . Satisfaction diagnostic evaluation initial complaint Predefined Analyses In addition primary secondary outcome , two predefined analysis related outcome . 1 . Cost Efficiency Analysis , measure total direct per-patient cost incur diagnostic strategy relate primary outcome . The direct per -patient cost evaluation outpatient angina calculate add follow component divide number patient test : 1. cost initial test diagnostic arm ( exercise treadmill test +/- coronary MSCT angiography 2. cost additional cardiac diagnostic test deem necessary refer provider completion initial diagnostic strategy arm evaluation initial complaint 3. cost subsequent inpatient/outpatient/ED evaluation initial cardiac complaint follow 24 month 4. cost subsequent radiographic test need incidental finding find MSCT follow 24 month The cost different diagnostic test utilize ( coronary MSCT angiography , exercise treadmill test , myocardial perfusion testing , exercise echocardiography , coronary angiography , radiographic test ) clinical encounter ( inpatient admission , ED evaluation , outpatient evaluation ) estimate current Medicare reimbursement rate . 2 . Statin aspirin use , measure change prevalence statin aspirin use among subject diagnostic arm .</detailed_description>
