	<detailed_description>Introduction Autosomal-Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) common hereditary renal disease , responsible 8 % 10 % case end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) Western country . The disease characterize progressive development fluid-filled cyst kidney . The renal cyst originate epithelia nephron line single layer cell higher rate cellular growth proliferation . At comparable level blood pressure control proteinuria , patient ADPKD fast decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) renal disease seem benefit extent ACE inhibitor therapy . Thus , renoprotective intervention ADPKD - addition achieve maximal reduction arterial blood pressure proteinuria limit effect additional potential promoter disease progression dyslipidemia , chronic hyperglycemia smoke - also specifically aim correct dysregulation epithelial cell growth , secretion , matrix interaction characteristic disease . ADPKD show genetic heterogeneity , least three different gene implicate : PKD1 gene ( 85 % case ) , PKD2 ( 15 % case ) , probably PDK3 gene ( yet identify ) . PKD1 gene identify decade ago , development treatment strategy hamper lack understanding function polycystin-1 ( PC1 ) , protein encode PKD1 gene . However , new function PC1 recently identify , suggest possibility future treatment option . Indeed , report PC1 tail interacts tuberin , product TSC2 gene . The main function tuberin inactivate Ser/Thr kinase mTOR , turn , promote phosphorylation two protein , S6-kinase 4E-BP1 . mTOR activity link increase cell growth , proliferation , apoptosis change differentiation . Researchers subsequently show ADPKD experimental animal model cyst line epithelial cell exhibit high mTOR activity , hypothesize PC1 normally suppress mTOR activity defect PC1 ( protein ) lead aberrant mTOR activation . Of interest , proteins localized primary cilium renal epithelial cell basal body cilia emanate . This finding lead view loss cilium function lead cyst formation kidney . The finding mTOR inappropriately activate polycystic kidney disease mouse model suggest mTOR activation may consequence loss cilium function . If mTOR converge point , would worthwhile possible drug target treatment renal cystic disorder . Sirolimus immunosuppressant mostly use management kidney transplant recipient . This drug specifically effectively inhibit mTOR , exert antiproliferative growth inhibit effect might serve prevent uncontrolled tubular cell proliferation could extremely important inhibition cyst progression APKD . Interestingly , study rat model ADPKD show short-term treatment sirolimus result dramatic reduction kidney size , prevent loss kidney function , lower cyst volume density . Similarly , retrospective observation kidney transplant recipient document sirolimus treatment reduce kidney volume 25 % , whereas effect patient give drug . Overall , finding provide basis design prospective study ADPKD patient aim document efficacy sirolimus treatment prevent increase even reduce total kidney volume renal volume take small cyst , eventually halt kidney disease progression . As additional aim present study , assess safety profile sirolimus , give ADPKD patient . Aim The general aim study assess efficacy safety 6 month treatment sirolimus ( top best available therapy ) compare conventional therapy adult patient ADPKD normal renal function mild moderate renal insufficiency . In particular compare change baseline total kidney volume volume sirolimus conventional treatment ADPKD group 6 month follow-up . Study Design This randomize , longitudinal , open , cross-over study baseline evaluation 6 month treatment period sirolimus give addition conventional anti-hypertensive therapy appropriately control blood pressure , ADPKD patient ( n=16 ) . Sirolimus Patients give sirolimus start oral daily dose 3 mg , periodical whole blood level measurement . The daily dose adjust keep sirolimus concentration within 10-15 ng/ml . Drug level assess day 5 start treatment every two week first month ; subsequently sirolimus concentration monitor monthly interval ( 5 day drug dose adjustment ) end study . Conventional Therapy There specific therapy ADPKD patient . Conventional treatment relate usually administration antihypertensive drug patient high blood pressure . Thus , present study , major change antihypertensive treatment introduce throughout whole study period unless deem clinically necessary ( reason change , however , clearly explain CRF ) . Only small change dose ongoing treatment recommend order maintain level blood pressure control ( target systolic/diastolic blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mnHg ) . This approach aim minimize confounding effect change concomitant treatment efficacy variable ( urinary protein excretion rate ) .</detailed_description>
