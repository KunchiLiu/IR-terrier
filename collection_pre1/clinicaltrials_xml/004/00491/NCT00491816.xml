	<brief_title>Erlotinib Plus Chemotherapy Treatment Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty percent woman breast cancer triple negative breast cancer . The standard treatment triple negative breast cancer typically combination chemotherapy , surgery , +/- radiation therapy . When treated standard therapy woman triple negative breast cancer bad long term outcome compare woman triple negative breast cancer . Triple negative breast cancer cell usually surface marker call EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) . Women whose breast cancer cell EGFR surface marker bad long term outcome compare woman whose tumor EGFR marker . Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) target EGFR currently use treatment cancer like lung pancreas . This study assess combination chemotherapy erlotinib woman triple negative breast cancer . For breast cancer patient receive chemotherapy first get surgery , long-term survival longer woman microscopic cancer time surgery . The primary objective study ass whether combination chemotherapy erlotinib result evidence microscopic disease ( pCR ) time surgery great 20 % enrolled subject . After complete chemotherapy , patient also receive maintenance erlotinib 12 month . This give study tolerability maintenance Erlotinib also evaluate maintenance erlotinib decrease rate tumor recurrence .</detailed_description>
