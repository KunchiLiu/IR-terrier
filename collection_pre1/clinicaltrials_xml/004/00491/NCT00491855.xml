	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Paclitaxel Plus Bevacizumab Advanced Peritoneal Carcinomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . Oxaliplatin design keep new cancer cell grow Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel . Study Drug Dose Levels : Up 12 study drug dose level test study . Participants enrol group 3 . The first 3 participant enrol low dose level . If intolerable side effect see , next 3 participant enrol next high dose level . This continue acceptable dose level study drug find . The dose level assign depend enroll study . You receive dose level entire study unless develop side effect , case dos drug decrease doctor . Drug Administration : If agree participate study , catheter place abdomen receive study drug . A catheter sterile flexible tube place local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . On Day 1 , receive bevacizumab follow paclitaxel needle vein 24 hour . On Day 2 , complete paclitaxel infusion , give 1 quart fluid contain oxaliplatin abdomen catheter 15 minute . On Day 8 , give 1 quart fluid contain paclitaxel abdomen catheter 15 minute . Every 21 day call study `` cycle . '' Study Visits : During cycle , see doctor office make sure still eligible receive study drug . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test day hospitalization week outpatient . - A urine sample collect cycle routine test . - You scan chest x-ray , CT , MRI , Positron emission tomography ( PET ) , and/or PET/CT scan every 2 cycle ( 6 week ) early study doctor think best interest , cancer get bad . These scan check status disease . If study doctor think appropriate , type scan may need perform . The study doctor discus scan , may ask sign separate consent form . Length Study : You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit : If take study , ask end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You repeat scan chest x-ray , CT , MRI , PET , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . If study doctor think appropriate , type scan may need perform . The study doctor discus scan , may ask sign separate consent form . This investigational study . Paclitaxel , oxaliplatin , bevacizumab FDA-approved drug , use study investigational . Up 72 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must advance peritoneal carcinomatosis : either disease establish standard care therapy fail one prior therapy . These include , limited , recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer , advance endometrial cancer , advance gastric cancer , advance colorectal cancer , advance primary peritoneal mesothelioma without significant chest involvement . Previous intraperitoneal therapy different agent allow long disease progress . 2 . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; = 2 ( 02 ) . 3 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; = 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin &lt; = 2.0 alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 * institutional upper limit normal ; Creatinine &lt; = 2.0 mg/dL creatinine clearance &gt; = 40mL/min/1.73m2 . 4 . Patients must able understand willingness sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve write informed consent document . 5 . Patients must evidence peritoneal carcinomatosis evaluable computer tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 6 . In clinical judgment investigator , patient must adequate potential intraperitoneal fluid distribution gross fluid loculations adhesion would significantly affect intraperitoneal drug distribution . This determination may make base documented clinical , image laboratory assessment . 7 . Patients must prothrombin time ( PT ) / partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within 1.2 * institutional upper limit normal &lt; 3 * institutional upper limit normal anticoagulant . 8 . Patients must rest blood pressure great 140 mmHg ( systolic ) 90 mmHg ( diastolic ) eligibility . Initiation adjustment blood pressure medication permit prior study entry . 1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia , active bleeding , active thrombosis , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 2 . History allergic reaction study drug analog . 3 . Failure recover prior surgery within 4 week study entry . 4 . Pregnant lactating . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ) prior study entry , duration study participation least 3 month last treatment . 5 . Any treatment specific tumor control within 3 week study drug ; within 2 week cytotoxic agent give weekly ( within 6 wks nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) , within 5 halflives target agent half life pharmacodynamic effect last less 5 day ( include limit erlotinib , sorafenib , sunitinib , bortezomib , similar agent ) ; failure recover toxic effect therapy prior study entry . 6 . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture ( include abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation intraabdominal abscess ) , history bleed diathesis . 7 . History radiotherapy abdominal pelvic region history multiple abdominal surgery contraindicate protocol therapy . 8 . Urine dipstick proteinuria &gt; /= 2+ ( patient discover &gt; /= 2+ proteinuria dipstick urinalysis baseline undergo 24 hour urine collection must demonstrate &lt; /= 1g protein 24 hour eligible ) . 9 . Grade 2 great neuropathy , history brain leptomeningeal metastases significantly increase risk intracranial bleeding .</criteria>
