	<brief_summary>This open-label clinical research study oral glycopyrrolate liquid treatment chronic moderate severe drool patient cerebral palsy neurological condition . Patients participate study receive oral glycopyrrolate liquid ( 1 mg/5 ml ) three time day ( TID ) study duration 24 week . After washout , screen , 2-day baseline period , patient enrol 4-week dose titration period . Glycopyrrolate liquid dos titrate use dose level Dose Titration Schedule . Titration begin 0.02 mg/kg per dose TID sequentially increase 0.02 mg/kg per dose increment TID every 5-7 day first four week optimal individualized response obtain patient maximum dose 0.1 mg/kg TID reach , exceed 3 mg TID Dose-level 5 Dose Titration Schedule , whichever less . Optimal dose patient dose he/she receive maximum benefit study drug ( great improvement drool ) experience minimum side effect . All patient receive close attention study staff throughout study .</brief_summary>
