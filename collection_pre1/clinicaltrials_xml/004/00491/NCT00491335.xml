	<brief_summary>Background : The incidence lung cancer quite high among people human immunodeficiency ( HIV ) virus . Frequent smoking may explain cancer increase , give 50 % 70 % HIV-infected people current smoker . Recent research suggest factor may involve well . Smoking habit , smoke earlier life smoke cigarette day others , may role . Also , HIV-infected smoker seem great risk chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The association HIV COPD important , COPD link increase risk lung cancer . About 1,600 subject study know ALIVE ( AIDS Linked Intra-Venous Experience ) , begin 1988 Baltimore , Maryland , give detailed questionnaire smoking behavior lung cancer risk factor . They also spirometry test , evaluate lung function . Objectives : To better characterize smoke habit compare tobacco use among HIV-infected uninfected drug user . To compare serum cotinine level spirometry result , marker tobacco use marker damage lung function , respectively . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age older ALIVE cohort . Design : Patients undergo follow procedure : - Completing questionnaire smoking history . Questions include age smoking begin , period quit smoking , average number cigarette per day specific period , amount cigarette smoke , depth inhalation , type cigarette , nicotine dependence , use smoke [ Note : I would mention drug illegal ] drug , exposure environmental tobacco smoke , past medical history , recent respiratory symptom . - Spirometry test . Patients ask breathe deeply possible rapidly exhale tube . The forced expiration volume 1 second reflect average flow rate first second , use determine degree pulmonary obstruction . - Blood sample . Tests measure level cotinine , chemical make body nicotine . African American male , constitute majority ALIVE cohort , participate test . Results would show much tobacco smoke recently enter body . For test , researcher plan evaluate 240 current tobacco smoker 100 participant report recent cigarette use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV Infection Tobacco Use Among Injection Drug Users Baltimore , Maryland : A Pilot Study Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer incidence substantially elevate among people infect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Although frequent smoking may partly explain increase , recent work suggest factor may also involve . To good characterize smoking habit lung cancer risk HIV-infected people , investigator propose cross-sectional pilot study HIV-infected uninfected injection drug user ALIVE cohort Baltimore , Maryland . A detailed questionnaire smoking behavior lung cancer risk factor administer ~ 1600 cohort subject . In addition , investigator measure serum cotinine ( marker recent smoking intensity ) sample 340 African American male cohort , stratify amount cigarette use , HIV status , CD4 count . Spirometry perform entire group 1600 subject , ass chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Differences HIV-infected uninfected subject smoke habit , exposure tobacco , lung damage identify area future investigation .</detailed_description>
