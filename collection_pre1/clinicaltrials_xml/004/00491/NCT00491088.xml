	<brief_summary>Specific Aim : 1 . To prove hypothesis severe OSA patient without daytime sleepiness , CPAP work effectively severe OSA patient daytime sleepiness . Using sham CPAP optimal placebo , conduct randomize double-blind placebo control trial ass CPAP effect severe OSA patient without daytime sleepiness . 2 . To establish model predict CPAP effect We use parameter five aspect , include change polysomnographic parameter , improvement sleepiness , fatigue QOL , sympathetic activity , inflammatory mediator metabolism , establish model predict CPAP effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CPAP Effect Severe Obstructive- Sleep- Apnea Patients Without Daytime Sleepiness : A Control Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disease , affect 4 % middle-aged men 2 % woman . Daytime sleepiness one symptom OSA drive patient seek medical help . Sleepiness OSA report raise microarousal , alter sleep structure somnogenic cytokine modification body metabolism . The assessment daytime sleepiness include objective measure , like multiple sleep latency test subjective measure , like Epworth sleepiness scale ( ESS ) . So far , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) standard treatment patient severe OSA . CPAP could improve daytime wakefulness , blood pressure quality life ( QOL ) . Several study try identify factor predict CPAP effect conclude CPAP effective patient high apnea-hypopnea index sleepy . All determine CPAP effect term daytime function , lower blood pressure QOL . None study evaluate CPAP effect term improvement sympathetic hyperactivity , inflammatory mediator metabolic abnormality . Therefore , assume patient whose daytime function n't improve CPAP treatment still possibly get benefit altering factor contribute cardiovascular consequence . Our previous study show CPAP effect OSA patient without sleepiness well patient sleepiness , except plasma level norepinephrine 24hr mean arterial blood pressure could lower patient sleepiness . However , without optimal placebo randomization , actual role CPAP treat non-sleepy OSA patient still could n't determine . Recently sham CPAP develop , mimic characteristic true CPAP except null pressure apply upper airway patient . Moreover , sham CPAP n't influence sleep efficiency , arousal , apnea-hypopnea index . Therefore , project , use sham CPAP placebo , propose randomize double-blind placebo control trial ass effectiveness CPAP severe OSA patient without daytime sleepiness . We also establish model predict CPAP effect . The result would change current practice manage severe OSA patient without daytime sleepiness .</detailed_description>
