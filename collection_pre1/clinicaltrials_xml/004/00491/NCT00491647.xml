	<brief_title>Time Perception Deficits Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Children attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , common , impair neuropsychiatric disorder , likely difficulty plan organize . They thing efficient way , feel limit time schedule , difficulty await turn ( Barkley , 1998 ) . They often spend much long time homework , forget accomplish routine prescheduled work . Such behavior often result conflict parent-child relationship . In order measure time perception , Barkley et al . ( 1997 ) develop two rating scale evaluate child 's sense time ability time management . They find association ADHD poor time management . Barkley 's ( 1998 ) comprehensive model suggest time perception deficit child ADHD due deficit behavioral inhibition executive function . Barkley et al 's time reproduction task show child ( 1997 ) , adolescent young adult ( 2001 ) ADHD significantly error . Recent study focus association time reproduction sustain attention , work memory , behavioral inhibition . Kerns et al . ( 2001 ) report positive association performance measure attention ( CPT ) time reproduction task mixed result relationship time reproduction inhibitory control work memory . McInerney Kerns ( 2003 ) find association time reproduction work memory behavioral inhibition , lend support notion time reproduction require executive function . Smith et al . ( 2002 ) find child ADHD impair time discrimination threshold less sensitive fine time perception . This finding later support Toplak et al ( 2003 , 2005 ) use different modality visual auditory stimulus . All time perception task require ability allocate attention ; however , different task involve different mental ability estimation duration presentation target . Verbal estimation task relate length one 's subject time unit , synonymous inner clock speed . Time discrimination time reproduction relate duration comparison . In addition estimate duration time discrimination task , subject need allocate attention long time produce target duration use executive function behavioral inhibition , sustain attention work memory . Few study examine efficacy medication treatment ADHD time perception . Although Barkley et al. , ( 1997 ) find effect psychostimulants time reproduction , Baldwin et al . ( 2004 ) find MPH significantly decrease time response variability , decrease lever hold extremely short duration . These finding suggest administration MPH result precise time performance without change mean duration lever hold . Although current empirical data study support ADHD time perception deficit MPH may effective improving time reproduction , information time perception deficit Chinese population . In view , conduct study investigate clinical treatment aspect time perception among child adolescent ADHD . Specific Aims : 1. examine developmental gender effect performance time perception ; 2. explore deficit time estimation , time discrimination , time reproduction child adolescent ADHD compare normal control ; 3. identify association ADHD symptom performance time perception task ; 4. investigate efficacy MPH time perception measure among child adolescent ADHD . METHODS Participants We recruit 100 patient DSM-IV ADHD , age 9 16 year , 100 school control . The 100 patient ADHD reassess time perception task 3 6 month later treatment outpatient department . Measures 1 . Diagnostic Tool Chinese version Kiddie-Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia- Epidemiology version ( K- SADS-E ) Development CK-SADS-E carry Child Psychiatry Research Group Taiwan ( Gau Soong , 1999 ) , include two-stage translation modification several item psycholinguistic equivalent relevant Taiwanese culture . Previous study prove CK-SADS-E reliable valid instrument ass child psychiatric disorder Taiwan . The CK-SADS-E widely use variety study mental illness child adolescent Taiwan ( e.g. , Gau et al. , 2005 ) . 2 . Questionnaires Chinese version Conners ' Parent Rating Scale-Revised : Short Form ( CPRS-R : S ) A 27-item parent-reported rating scale assessment behavioral symptom , four subscales : Oppositional ( 6 item ) , Inattention/Cognitive Problems ( 6 item ) , Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ( 6 item ) , ADHD-index ( 12 item ) , use . Each item rat 4-point Likert scale—0 true ( never , seldom ) , 1 little true ( occasionally ) , 2 pretty much true ( often , quite bit ) , 3 much true ( often , frequent ) ( Gau et al. , 2006 ) . The Chinese version Conners ' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised : Short Form ( CTRS-R : S ) A 28-item teacher-reported rating scale assessment behavioral symptom , four subscales : Oppositional ( 5 item ) , Cognitive Problems/Inattention ( 5 item ) , Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ( 7 item ) , ADHD-index ( 12 item ) , use . Like CPRS-R : S , item rat 0 true ( never , seldom ) 3 much true ( often , frequent ) ( Gau et al. , 2006 ) . The Swanson , Nolan , Pelham , version IV ( SNAP-IV Scale ) The SNAP-IV 26-item rating scale consist DSM-IV symptom Inattention ( Item 1-9 ) Hyperactivity/Impulsivity domain ( Item 10-18 ) criterion ADHD , oppositional symptom ( Item 19-26 ) criterion ODD . Several study use different version SNAP , either parent teacher form , outcome measure ass efficacy treatment ADHD ( e.g. , Steele et al. , 2006 ) . Regarding psychometric property SNAP rating scale , Chinese version SNAP-IV show satisfactory test-retest reliability ( intraclass correlation= 0.59~0.72 ) , internal consistency ( alpha=0.88~0.90 ) , concurrent validity ( Pearson correlation = 0.56~0.72 ) , discriminant validity ( Liu et al. , 2006 ) . 3 . Neuropsychological Tests Verbal Estimation Task This task , modify Barkley et al . ( 2001a ) , assess length participant 's subjective temporal unit . First , green circle present central several second disappear . Subject ask duration target 5 , 12 , 17 , 25 second . For presentation random , two trial render eight trial total . Time Discrimination Task Time discrimination task , modify Smith et al . ( 2002 ) present green circle leave first , follow red circle right . The subject ask press key indicate circle long duration . The standard stimulus comparison last 1000ms , 1350ms , respectively . The two circle randomly present . If answer correct , comparison duration decrease 15ms ; answer wrong , comparison duration increase 15ms . The task continue either subject make six reversal , 20 trial , whichever occur first . Time Reproduction Task The time reproduction task modify Barkley et al . ( 1997 ) . First , green circle present central second five duration : 2 , 5 , 10 , 12 , 17seconds . Subject ask press key create temporal duration green circle . Two trial give five duration random presentation . The raw time reproduction convert absolute discrepancy score , consist absolute value magnitude discrepancy participant 's time production interval present subject measure extent error . Conners ' Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) The CPT require tabbing space key character X show screen . There six set total , 20 character within set . The Inter-Stimulus Intervals ( ISIs ) 1 , 2 , 4 second , different ISIs vary set . Each character maintain screen 250 m . Correct hit , omission error , commission error , reaction time collect index response selection capacity/focus . The ' value know discriminate factor one index sustain attention . The Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children - 3rd edition short form WISC-III ( Wechsler , 1991 ) well establish scale design ass Full-Scale IQ ( FSIQ ) child age 16 . It include 13 subtests test child 's cognitive ability different dimension . Test result represent Verbal IQ , Performance IQ , Full-Scale IQ . The present research conduct quad combination WISC short form include subtests Symbol Search , Arithmetic , Block Design , Verbal . Previous research suggest mentioned combination good reliability ( rxx = .91 ) validity ( rxx = .90 ) ( Silverstein , 1982 ) , preferred conduct research estimate FSIQ . Procedure We obtain write informed consent subject child parent . The day prior date receive neuropsychological task , child ask halt medication ( drug-naïve patient ) order obtain test result baseline data make comparison performance treatment medication 3 month one year . The testing procedure follow : ( 1 ) In addition clinical diagnosis , subject ' mother receive K-SADS-E interview make psychiatric diagnosis . ( 2 ) All subject ( ADHD group normal control ) assess IQ series time perception task . Their parent complete SNAP-IV CPRS-R : S teacher complete CTRS-R : S. ( 3 ) After receive medication ADHD 3 month one year , child reassess time perception task CPT . Their parent teacher ask complete rating scale . Anticipated Results : We anticipate ADHD group perform poor time estimation , time discrimination , time reproduction , particularly difficult task , impairment reduce treatment medication .</detailed_description>
