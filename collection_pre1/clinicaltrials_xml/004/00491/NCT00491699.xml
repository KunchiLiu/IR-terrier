The subject stage IIIB NSCLC malignant effusion , stage IV recurrent NSCLC amenable curative therapy ( either surgery radiation therapy ) . 4 . The subject least 18 year old . 5 . The subject Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 . 6 . The subject life expectancy ≥3 month . 7 . The subject adequate organ marrow function . 8 . The subject cardiacspecific enzyme level ( creatine phosphokinase [ CPK ] total , CPKMB , troponin ) institution 's ULN . 9 . The subject capable understanding protocol sign informed consent document . 10 . Sexually active subject ( male female ) must use medically accept method contraception entire course study . 11 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test enrollment . 12 . If subject receive three prior regimen cytotoxic chemotherapy , two biological target therapy , 3000 cGy &gt; 25 % bone marrow , investigator must discuss sponsor regard subject suitability prior enrollment . 13 . The subject diagnosis malignancy ( unless nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix , malignancy diagnose ≥5 year ago , evidence disease 5 year prior screen study ) . 1 . The subject receive systemic anticancer therapy ( eg , chemotherapy , biologic therapy , target therapy , cytokine , hormone ) within 14 day first dose study drug . 2 . The subject receive radiation &gt; 25 % bone marrow within 30 day XL999 treatment . 3 . The subject recover Grade ≤1 adverse event ( AEs ) due investigational agent administer 14 day prior study enrollment . 4 . The subject history know brain metastasis , current spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . 5 . The subject know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 6 . The subject uncontrolled and/or intercurrent illness include limited following : 1 . Cardiac : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) assess 99mTc multiplegated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) institution 's low limit normal ( LLN ) screening . If regional wall motion abnormality note MUGA , cardiology consultation perform prior enrollment . History pulmonary hypertension . History congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class II , III , IV ) . Active unstable ischemic disease , include angina pectoris , myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) within past 12 month . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) show sign ischemia myocardial , valvular , coronary artery disease unless deem clinically insignificant cardiologist . Onset change screen ECG predose ECG unless deem clinically insignificant cardiologist . ECG abnormality could cause interpretation difficulty XL999 administration ( eg , leave bundle branch block [ LBBB ] , atrial fibrillation , AV block , pacemaker , digoxin ) . 2 .
