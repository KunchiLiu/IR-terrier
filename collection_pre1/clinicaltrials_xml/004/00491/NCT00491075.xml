	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine clinical activity Pemetrexed + Gemcitabine non-clear cell renal cell cancer ( RCC ) . Clinical activity take account response rate progression free survival ( PFS ) . Secondary Objectives : - To determine toxicity Pemetrexed + Gemcitabine non-clear cell RCC . - To estimate survival rate patient non-clear cell RCC treat combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Plus Gemcitabine Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pemetrexed chemotherapy drug use treat cancer . It give intravenously ( IV -- vein arm ) . It interfere cell reproduction . Gemcitabine cancer-fighting ( chemotherapy ) drug give IV . It interfere growth cell use treat cancer . Dexamethasone many different medical us . It use treat cancer , nausea , vomit , inflammation , allergic reaction , many condition . In study , give prevent rash . Folic acid Vitamin B12 vitamins give prevent serious side effect occur chemotherapy . These side effect include diarrhea decrease red blood cell , white blood cell , blood platelet . You require take folic acid vitamin B12 . You take folic acid , mouth , daily begin 1 week first dose Pemetrexed . You continue take daily 3 week last dose chemotherapy . Vitamin B12 give injection muscle 1 2 week first dose Pemetrexed . You injections vitamin B12 every 9 week 3 week last dose chemotherapy . During treatment , give Pemetrexed IV 10 minute , follow Gemcitabine IV 30 minute Day 1 2-week study `` cycle . '' You take Dexamethasone tablet mouth , 2 time day day , day , day dose Pemetrexed . Dexamethasone take prevent rash . If could take Dexamethasone day and/or day Pemetrexed , may give Dexamethasone IV 20 minute , 30 minute infusion Pemetrexed . You blood sample ( 4 teaspoon ) drawn every week test bone marrow . You blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn every 2 week make sure kidney liver work well . You physical exam every 2 week receive chemotherapy . You also ask medication take since last visit . Once every 8 week 4 cycle treatment , tumor ( ) measure use standard care imaging may include CT scan , MRI , bone scan . You treat long benefiting therapy . You continue receive treatment unless tumor grows , intolerable side effect occur , develop another illness prevent continue therapy . You may also take study fail comply study requirement . If take study reason , doctor discus treatment option time . If take study , ask scan , physical exam , routine blood ( 4 teaspoon ) . You contact every 3 month study , get update health status . This investigational study . Pemetrexed Gemcitabine FDA approve commercially available . About 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm advanced nonclear cell RCC . Patients locally recurrent disease eligible . Patients locally advance unresectable RCC measurable metastatic disease eligible protocol . Patients bilateral renal cancer eligible long cancer nonclear cell type patient metastatic disease . Patients must measurable disease . Patients previously treat untreated , nonthreatening brain metastasis eligible . For previously treat patient , prior whole brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery must &gt; 3 month initiation current therapy plan concurrent radiation study . Patients surgical resection brain metastasis eligible enroll recover surgery . Life expectancy &gt; 8 week Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : ( 1 ) Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9g/dl ; ( 2 ) absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 1,500/microL ; ( 3 ) platelet &gt; /=100,000/microL ; ( 4 ) total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 mg/dl ; ( 5 ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST SGOT ) and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT SGPT ) ( SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 * institutional upper limit normal ( uln ) , &lt; /= 5 * uln liver metastasis exist ; ( 6 ) creatinine clearance ( calculate CockcroftGault formula ) &gt; /= 45 mL/min Patients must recover effect surgery and/or radiation therapy free significant detectable infection . Female patient childbearing potential must normal plasma beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( bHCG ) within 24 hour prior enrol study . Patients elevate bHCG undergo appropriate evaluation rule pregnancy ( ie referral OBGyn service , ultrasound ) pregnancy rule elevated bHCG determine tumor origin , patient permit proceed study . Patients child father childbearing potential must agree practice form medically acceptable birth control study Patients must give write consent prior initiation therapy , keep policy institution . Patients history major psychiatric illness must judge able fully understand investigational nature study risk associate therapy . The approved consent attach protocol . Pregnant lactating woman . No prior malignancy allow , except nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma site , cancer patient adequately treated disease free 2 year . Patients must receive 2 prior systemic therapy RCC , patient receive prior chemotherapy RCC . Chemotherapy give type cancer 2 year prior enrollment protocol permit . Patients must schedule receive experimental drug MRCC study . Patients permit concomitant bisphosphonates megestrol acetate . Patients permit receive hematopoietic growth factor accord American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) guideline . Patients must prior radiotherapy area measurable disease , unless clearly progressive disease site , measurable disease outside area prior radiation . Radiotherapy , need palliation , must complete prior enrollment study . Patients must significant medical disease ( malignancy ) , opinion investigator , would significantly increase risk participation trial . Examples exclusion : unstable angina pectoris , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure , unstable symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia require medication ( subject control chronic atrial fibrillation eligible ) , myocardial infarction within last 6 month , uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 160/110 therapy ) uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . Patients must history disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render subject high risk treatment complication . Patients unwilling participate unable comply protocol duration study . Inability unwillingness take corticosteroid , folic acid vitamin B12 supplementation . Inability interrupt aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent 5 day period ( short act NSAIDs ) 8day period ( longlasting NSAIDs , piroxicam )</criteria>
