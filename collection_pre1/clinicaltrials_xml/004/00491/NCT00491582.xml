	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate effect growth hormone lipid-content muscle liver well visceral fat mass relation insulin sensitivity . In addition , hormonal regulation free fatty availability assess physical exercise 50-60 % VO2max . Finally , value physical exercise diagnose growth hormone deficiency investigate . Hypothesis : 1 ) Lipid content muscle liver change physical exercise exercise capacity free fatty availability influence change . 2 ) Growth hormone replacement therapy predominantly reduce visceral fat mass increase free fatty availability . 3 ) Free fatty availability exercise reduce growth hormone deficient patient 4 ) Physical exercise may alternative way diagnose growth hormone deficiency</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Growth Hormone ( GH ) Lipid Depots</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using two-step hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique hepatic peripheral insulin sensitivity assess . Lipid depot ( skeletal muscle liver ) measure MR-spectroscopy , visceral fat mass MR-imaging . Exercise capacity ist measure treadmill . Counterregulatory hormone , glucose free fatty acid measure 2h physical exercise 50-60 VO2max Identical investigation perform adult growth hormone ( GH ) deficient patient six month GH replacement therapy , sedentary match control subject endurance train athlete .</detailed_description>
