	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety RAD001 high dose drug give people HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer safely combination trastuzumab . RAD001 use patient severe rheumatoid arthritis , recipients solid-organ transplant , healthy volunteer experiment animal , information research study suggest RAD001 may help stop cancer cell grow abnormally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Followed Study RAD001 Combination With Trastuzumab HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look dose RAD001 give safely combination trastuzumab , everyone receive amount RAD001 . Small group participant enrol certain dose RAD001 tolerate medication well , next small group receive high dose . This continue optimal dose RAD001 give combination trastuzumab find . - Blood drawn day 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 first cycle treatment every 4 cycle everolimus pharmacokinetics analysis . - There optional tissue biopsy component study ask 2 biopsy perform pre-treatment cycle one . - We keep track participant medical condition next three year call telephone twice year see . OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess safety tolerability RAD001 combination trastuzumab HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer Secondary - To evaluate activity RAD001 plus trastuzumab , define objective response rate , patient progression trastuzumab-containing regimen - To evaluate change signal molecule response trastuzumab RAD001 circulate tumor cell tumor tissue - To evaluate pharmacokinetics RAD001 combination trastuzumab . STATISTICAL DESIGN : This Phase I study follow standard 3+3 dose escalation design two dose level everolimus combination trastuzumab evaluate . The DLT observation period cycle one ( first 21 day treatment ) . There 20 patient expansion cohort treat MTD . The regimen would consider promise least 2 objective response observe 20 treated patient . If true unknown response rate 15 % probability observe least 2 response 82 % true rate 5 % probability reduce 26 % .</detailed_description>
