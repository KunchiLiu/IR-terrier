	<brief_summary>In patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , disease cause nonsense mutation ( premature stop codon ) gene make cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) protein . PTC124 show partially restore CFTR production animal CF due nonsense mutation . The main purpose study understand whether PTC124 safely increase functional CFTR protein cell patient CF due nonsense mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTC124 Pediatric Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient CF due nonsense mutation treat new investigational drug call PTC124 . Evaluation procedure ( history , physical examination , blood urine test assess organ function , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , chest x-ray , CF-specific test ) determine patient qualifies study perform within 21 day prior start treatment . Eligible patient nonsense-mutation-mediated CF receive two repeat 28-day cycle , comprise 14 day therapy 14 day therapy . In crossover design , patient randomize receive PTC124 treatment Cycle 1 either follow regimen : - PTC124 , give 3 time per day ( TID ) regimen 4 mg/kg breakfast , 4 mg/kg lunch , 8 mg/kg dinner , - PTC124 , give 3 time per day ( TID ) regimen 10 mg/kg breakfast , 10 mg/kg lunch 20 mg/kg dinner . In Cycle 2 , patient receive drug accord regimen opposite give Cycle 1 . There 2-night stay clinical research center begin end 14 day PTC124 treatment , mean four 2-night stay clinical research center study . During study , PTC124 efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics evaluate periodically measurement transepithelial potential difference ( TEPD ) , nasal mucosal brush assess cellular CFTR mRNA protein , medical history , physical examination , blood test , sputum test , urinalysis , ECGs , chest x-ray , pulmonary function test .</detailed_description>

Ability provide write informed consent and/or assent . 13 . Evidence sign date informed consent document ( patient legal guardian ) indicate patient and/or legal guardian inform pertinent aspect trial . The presence follow condition exclude patient enrollment study : 1 . Prior exposure PTC124 . 2 . Prior ongoing medical condition ( eg , concomitant illness , alcoholism , drug abuse , psychiatric condition ) , medical history , physical finding , ECG finding , laboratory abnormality , investigator 's opinion , could adversely affect safety patient , make unlikely course treatment followup would complete , could impair assessment study result . 3 . Ongoing acute illness include acute upper low respiratory infection within 2 week start study treatment . 4 . History major complication lung disease ( include recent massive hemoptysis pneumothorax ) within 2 month prior start study treatment . 5 . Abnormalities screen chest xray suggest clinically significant active pulmonary disease CF , new , significant abnormality atelectasis pleural effusion may indicative clinically significant active pulmonary involvement secondary CF . 6 .
