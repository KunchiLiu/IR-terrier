	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization estimate dengue virus cause 50 million case dengue fever year . Dengue virus infection lead cause hospitalization death child tropical Asian country . There four different serotypes dengue virus . Most case dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome cause secondary infection dengue serotype different first serotype individual infect . A vaccine would effective prevent infection multiple dengue serotypes desirable . The purpose study determine safety immune response two different dengue virus vaccine individual previously vaccinate different serotype . This study last least 42 day . Participants recruit database previous dengue vaccine recipient stratify type vaccine previously receive . Participants assign Cohort 1 Cohort 2 already vaccinate rDEN4delta30 vaccine . Participants assign Cohort 3 already vaccinate rDEN2/4delta30 ( ME ) vaccine . Participants Cohort 4 already vaccinate rDEN1delta30 vaccine . Participants Cohorts 1 3 randomly assign receive either rDEN1delta30 vaccine placebo . Participants Cohorts 2 4 randomly assign receive either rDEN2/4delta30 ( ME ) vaccine placebo .
