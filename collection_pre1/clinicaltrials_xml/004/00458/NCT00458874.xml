	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether knowledge abnormal result noninvasive test detection subclinical atherosclerosis ( carotid intima medium thickness [ CIMT ] ) , addition knowledge cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor , enhances adherence healthy lifestyle behavior comparison CVD risk factor knowledge . We believe participant CVD risk factor knowledge CIMT test result show significant subclinical atherosclerosis demonstrate well adherence therapeutic lifestyle change ( TLC ) subject CIMT test information withheld .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The outcomes subject randomize receive CIMT information ( R-CIMT Group ) compare control condition subject randomize CIMT information withheld ( W-CIMT Group ) completion lifestyle intervention common group . The rationale intervention base Health Belief Model theory risk awareness prompt action behavioral change . In particular , aim study impact subject 's CIMT result , impact generic educational material relate CIMT CHD risk , adherence lifestyle change program . Subjects know hypothesis study knowledge could potentially impact behavior intervention . Also , subject tell half receive CIMT information lifestyle intervention , since subject could potentially infer study hypothesis knowledge . To answer question whether CIMT result would useful motivational tool adherence lifestyle change recommendation , need comparison group CIMT result . Subjects clearly told consent process result may receive result clinical testing , include CIMT result , end participation study . Randomization occur subject successfully complete `` run-in '' period screening , introduces lifestyle intervention teach proper use data collection tool . At begin week randomize phase study , subject receive confidential packet script material . Packets contain identical information ( e.g . educational material , class schedule , feedback diet/exercise log ) except R-CIMT group also receive report contains copy one ultrasound scan , comparison picture normal scan . This report also include CIMT thickness artery interpretation state measurement high quartile person age gender . Attached report tutorial ( `` Interpreting Your CIMT Results '' ) fully educate participant detection atherosclerosis carotid ultrasound . Both CIMT result report tutorial specifically couple presence significant subclinical atherosclerosis increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . ( Appendix D ) . If subject CIMT information withheld request CIMT result study , tell result make available end participation study , consistent information give consent process . At end study , subject randomize receive CIMT information ask complete quiz ( Atherosclerosis CIMT Knowledge Assessment ) determine comprehension CIMT information provide randomization ( Appendix D ) . Lifestyle Intervention All randomize subject participate 12-week lifestyle intervention program introduce observed `` run-in '' period screen . This intervention incorporate strategy prove benefit reduction CVD risk include aerobic exercise , Mediterranean-type diet , ongoing contact weekly , on-site group session lifestyle change education support integrate Transtheoretical Stages Change Social Cognitive learn theories.74-76 To minimize potential unblinding research staff randomization assignment large number subject , subject enter next available block 12-weekly group session regardless randomization assignment . To minimize potential unblinding study subject study hypothesis , subject instruct refrain discuss personal medical information contain weekly packet receive group support session . Randomization assignment know statistician/data management team . Aerobic Exercise Physical activity pillar lifestyle intervention program improve cardiorespiratory muscular fitness promote improvement CHD risk factor include obesity , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia . Based subject 's baseline fitness safety issue , physical activity program ( goal 180 minute aerobic exercise per week end study ) prescribe exercise physiologist tailor individual choice various type moderate intensity activity . Exercise recommend occur day week least 10 minute per session within defined target heart rate range . After `` run-in '' period , exercise unsupervised assessed heart rate monitoring device self-monitoring log . Diet A Mediterranean-type diet caloric goal base subject 's weight prescribe registered dietician . The composition diet structure encourage consumption plant-based , minimally process , seasonal food include fruit , vegetable , whole grain , legume , nut , fish poultry preference red meat , low-fat dairy product , limited amount beneficial unsaturated oil olive oil . The recommended diet maximum 35 % total calorie fat , maximum 7 % total calorie saturate fat , minimum 15 % total calorie protein . Subjects instructed meal planning food preparation . Structured menu offer option . Review self-monitoring log dietician guide individual feedback `` run-in '' period weekly communication packet randomized period . Group Support Weekly on-site session hold stimulate social support lifestyle intervention . A structured curriculum focus goal setting , problem solving , stress reduction present trained facilitator opportunity open discussion . To reinforce diet plan , group meal periodic food preparation demonstration also occur session .</detailed_description>
