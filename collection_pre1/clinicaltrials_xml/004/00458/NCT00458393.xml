	<brief_title>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate HIV Prevention Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Joint United Nations Programme AIDS estimate 14,000 person newly infect HIV every day worldwide ; one half infection occur people age 15 24 . New infection occur despite widespread awareness mode HIV transmission protection afford condom use . Effective intervention HIV prevention urgently need . This study evaluate safety efficacy chemoprophylaxis HIV prevention men sex men ( MSM ) high risk HIV infection despite use condom , receive HIV counseling , receive treatment STIs , particularly hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection . A daily combination dose emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) select evaluation well-established safety record previous study demonstrate effective HIV prevention primate model . These medication long half-lives allow daily dose know interaction hormonal contraception , methadone , tuberculosis therapy . Once study drug , participant follow variable length time , start within 4 week screen visit last 144 week . All participant follow least 8 week stop study drug . Participants reactive Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) test follow hepatic flare 16 additional week total 24 week stop study drug . If enrol optional substudy bone mineral density , fat distribution , fast lipid , participant ask return one additional visit 24 week stop study drug . Participants HIV seroconvert participation also follow end study . All study visit 4 week interval . At study entry , high risk , HIV uninfected MSM randomly assign receive either daily FTC/TDF placebo , addition standard HIV counseling , condom , sexually transmit infection ( STI ) management . The study closely monitor biological behavioral safety , include careful analysis drug resistance , kidney liver function , risk behavior . At screen visit , participant undergo HIV antibody HBV testing , medical history , medical exam , blood urine collection , risk behavior assessment , STI test . At study entry , participant give study medication ; test HCV ; offer HBV vaccine , applicable . At study visit , HIV antibody test , pill count , adherence check , study medication distribution , HIV counseling , condom distribution . A medical history blood take select visit , along STI test treatment need . Testing treatment STIs provide cost participant . All study participant encourage join substudy assess interaction HBV infection , bone mineral density fat distribution , immune function . If enrol substudy , participant ask return one additional visit 24 week stop study medication . All participant substudy undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan , HIV infect participant undergo additional blood collection . Sites option participate follow four substudies : The Hair Substudy : Participants receive FTC/TDF eligible enroll . At 12-week follow-up study visit , hair sample collect questionnaire complete . The Urine Substudy : For participant elect enroll substudy , additional test occur blood urine sample collect 24-week follow-up visit . An additional urine collection occur 8 week participant stop receive FTC/TDF . The Semen Substudy : Participants seroconvert study may elect participate substudy . One semen sample collect participant ' next study visit plasma viral load test perform . The Gonorrhea Chlamydia Substudy : Participants substudy undergo rectal oropharyngeal swab procedure urine collection 24-week study visit . After randomized phase end , daily oral FTC/TDF arm show beneficial safe , participant give option participate open label extension phase . During extension phase , study participant receive daily oral open-label FTC/TDF , addition standard counseling , condom , STI management .</detailed_description>
