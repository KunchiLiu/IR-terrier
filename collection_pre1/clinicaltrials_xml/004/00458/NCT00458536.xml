	<brief_summary>The main purpose study test safety dendritic cell/tumor fusion study vaccine combination laboratory-made agent call Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) . Another purpose determine type severity side effect associate study vaccine . GM-CSF similar substance body stimulate production white blood cell . To create study vaccine , cell remove participant tumor fuse dendritic cell obtain participant blood . Dendritic cell responsible immune response `` foreign '' substance enter body . Animal study show fused cell stimulate powerful anti-tumor response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination Patients With Renal Cell Cancer With Dendritic Cell Tumor Fusions GM-CSF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients asked participate choose undergo `` debulking nephrectomy '' ( surgery remove tumor kidney , cancer cell body ) standard treatment kidney cancer tumor lesion accessible remove treat diagnose cancer . - Participants enrol study assign receive particular dose dendritic cell/tumor fusion vaccine cell . The dose determine enrolled study . There two cohort study . The first cohort give vaccine alone . If vaccine well tolerated proceed second cohort . The second cohort receive GM-CSF addition vaccine . - Tumor cell collect make study vaccine . Based location cancer , decision make best approach obtain cell . - Participants undergo procedure know leukapheresis order obtain dendritic cell . Prior procedure receive 1 2 injection GM-CSF help increase white blood cell count . - If sufficient number cell obtain , tumor cell dendritic cell fuse ( mixed ) together laboratory divide appropriate dos administration . - The treatment consist 3 vaccination fuse cell give injection skin 3-week interval . The first six participant receive study vaccine . The remain participant receive study vaccine combine GM-CSF . - If enough vaccine make participant receive 3 dos , participant may receive 2 dos study vaccine . - Approximately 3 4 tablespoon blood collect certain time test immune system determine study vaccine increase immune response tumor cell . Weekly visit physical exam , assessment adverse event safety lab conduct . - Regular blood draw do least 6 month follow completion study follow safety lab monitor immune response . Monthly physical exam perform follow last injection study vaccine . At one month , three month , six month follow date participant receive last study vaccine , CT scan see study vaccine affect disease .</detailed_description>
