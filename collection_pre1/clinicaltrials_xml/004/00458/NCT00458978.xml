	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Recurrent Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective clinical response patient recurrent newly diagnose metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat AZD2171 ( cediranib maleate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety profile drug patient . II . Assess early late physiological biological effect drug tumor interstitial fluid pressure , pO2 , tumor microvasculature . III . Assess value potential noninvasive biomarkers response , include plasma level molecule involve angiogenesis , circulate endothelial cell progenitor cell , functional imaging change treatment . IV . Assess gene expression pattern treatment predictor clinical biological response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral cediranib maleate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced CT image blood collection periodically study research study assess plasma level angiogenic/antiangiogenic molecule , circulate endothelial cell ( flow cytometry ) , progenitor cell , protein analysis potential biomarkers .</detailed_description>
