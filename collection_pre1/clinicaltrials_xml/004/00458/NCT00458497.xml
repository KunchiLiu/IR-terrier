	<brief_summary>This study design assess effect sock bed material foot pain , level blood oxygen exist foot quality sleep subject chronic foot pain either diabetic neuropathy condition , e.g. , peripheral arterial disease , regenerative joint disease ) . The three main hypothesis test : 1 ) compare placebo sock , subject wear Holofiber sock experience reduction foot pain , 2 ) compare placebo bedding , subject sleep bed line Holofiber mattress pad experience improve quality sleep 3 ) compare placebo sock , subject wear Holofiber sock increase blood oxygenation level foot .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Holofiber Socks Bedding Pain Quality Sleep Subjects With Chronic Foot Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Holofiber patent process add micron size optically active quartz , aluminum oxide titanium oxide particles polymer yarn . It believe Holofiber particle increase skin illumination pigment enzymes activate , lead increase blood flow oxygenation skin neighbor soft tissue . Previous clinical trial demonstrate approximately 7 % increase skin oxygen level use Holofiber glove sock , compare glove sock fabricate identical polymer fiber lack optical particle . Numerous anecdotal report patient chronic foot arm pain indicate wear Holofiber garment even day lead dramatic improvement many different painful condition . Similarly , many subject chronic sleep disturbance report improved quality sleep use Holofiber bedding . The current study design 1 ) substantiate ability Holofiber sock alleviate chronic pain result diabetic neuropathy chronic foot disorder , 2 ) determine Holofiber bed improves quality sleep 3 ) determine Holofiber sock increase blood oxygenation level foot wear . Subjects give inform consent meet study inclusion exclusion criterial undergo brief medical history physical examination , include monofilament test sensory neuropathy measurement blood pressure four extremity use Doppler ultrasound , answer panel questionnaires assess pain sleep quality . Spouses partner eligible subject similarly consent fill questionnaire relate sleep share bed participate subject . Subjects spouses/partners ask return one week later complete questionnaire , time subject randomize ( double-blind ) receive either Holofiber placebo sock bed material . Subjects instruct use sock bed material exclusively two week . Subjects spouses/partners return three four week follow-up repeat questionnaire visit . At Visit 4 , subject foot photograph use Hyperspectral camera identify blood oxygenation wear Holofiber placebo sock . Once final set photograph take , visit end patient participation conclude .</detailed_description>
