	<brief_summary>The goal propose study , Health Benefits Aerobic Resistance Training individual type 2 diabetes ( HART-D ) , compare effect resistance train alone ( RT ) , resistance combination aerobic training ( AT+RT ) , aerobic train alone ( AT ) standard care ( SC ) hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C ) , initially sedentary woman men type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health Benefits Aerobic Resistance Training Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although generally accept regular exercise provide substantial health benefit individual T2D , exact exercise prescription term type ( AT versus RT versus AT+RT ) still remain important research issue , particularly regard week-to-week glucose control assess HbA1C . There need adequately power well-controlled study examine effect RT , AT AT+RT HbA1C individual T2D . With incidence T2D expect increase dramatically come year , essential well understand relative benefit various exercise intervention . This information help well formulate exercise recommendation patient T2D well potentially provide exercise option , important give small percentage individual TD2 regularly exercise . The study group sedentary woman men T2D , age 30 75 year . We randomly assign 262 individual aerobic exercise training group ( AT ; n=72 ) , resistance training group ( RT ; n=73 ) , combination aerobic plus resistance training ( AT+RT ; n=76 ) , standard care group ( SC ; n=41 ) . The AT individual participate 3 4 training session week 9 month progress total energy expenditure 12 kcal/kg/week ( KKW ) , exercise dose consistent current public health recommendation physical activity individual T2D . The target exercise intensity 50 % -80 % baseline VO2 max . The RT group participate 3 session per week ( 9 exercise , 2-3 set ) , focus large muscle group . This RT regimen base study successfully improve HbA1C individual T2D . Individuals AT+RT group complete 10 KKW aerobic training reduce resistance-training regimen 2 session per week ( 9 exercise , 1 set ) . The AT+RT regimen represent exercise recommendation American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) . Simply state , compare effect resistance training alone , resistance combination aerobic training , aerobic train alone standard care HbA1C , initially sedentary woman men T2D . The primary outcome measure HbA1C , integrated measure blood glucose control past 8-12 week . Other outcomes interest include rest blood pressure , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , total body fat , lean muscle mass measure DEXA , cardiorespiratory fitness , muscular strength , metabolic measure include serum cholesterol triglyceride .</detailed_description>
