	<brief_title>Use Spinal Sealant System During Spinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CSF provide liquid cushion brain spinal cord . The dura hold CSF . In order spinal surgery , doctor cut open dura . At end surgery , dura must seal order keep CSF leak . The doctor close dura stitch also piece tissue take another place body , help close opening . Other standard sealant method include use Oxicel , Gelfoam , fibrin glue , method design closing dura . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your doctor see within 30 day operation . At visit , medical history record , ask question operation past . You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . You sample blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect kidney liver function test make sure function properly . You also ask fill 2 questionnaire health , daily activity , back pain . The questionnaire take 20 30 minute complete . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group . Participants one group receive Spinal Sealant . You 2 3 chance randomly assign spinal sealant group . Participants group receive standard method close dura stitch . However , know one two treatment receive . Also , ( need ) piece muscle , fat , soft tissue may take another place body help seal opening . Doctors may also use Oxicel , Gelfoam , fibrin glue help seal dura . After already schedule spinal surgery , doctor try close opening dura , may do stitch alone , need , stitch piece muscle , fat , soft tissue take another place body . After try , still CSF leak dura , assign one 2 group treatment . If CSF leak need treatment , able take part study , come back study visit . Participants assign first group receive treatment Spinal Sealant , spray stitch close open dura . The Spinal Sealant make 2 plastic-type liquid . When mixed together , gel form mostly make water . The gel look feel sort like soft contact lens . After doctor try seal open dura , Spinal Sealant spray stitch . It act like thin , stretchy cover help stop CSF leak stitch area properly heal . It blue-colored , doctor see spray . Within 1 2 month , gel naturally break body remove urine . Participants assign second group treat doctor 's choice standard treatment close open dura . You know group assign end study participation ( 90 day ) . While still hospital ( within 7 day operation ) , physical exam , doctor clinical test check CSF leak . Also , sample blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw kidney liver function test . For follow-up , see doctor 30 day 90 day operation . It important return see doctor schedule follow-up visit , even feel fine . At follow-up visit , doctor perform physical exam check see dura wound heal CSF leakage . You sample blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect kidney liver function test . You also ask fill 2 questionnaire health , daily activity , back pain . The questionnaire take 20 30 minute finish . Your participation study 90-day follow-up visit . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . The Spinal Sealant authorize FDA use research . About 158 patient take part multicenter study . Between 15 20 participant enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
