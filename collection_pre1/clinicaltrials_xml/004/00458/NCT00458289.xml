	<brief_summary>Patients end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) commonly high concentration phosphorous , mineral , blood ( hyperphosphatemia ) . This result inability excrete phosphorous kidney . This turn may result development condition know secondary hyperparathyroidism renal osteodystrophy bone disease . As , patient often receive medication know phosphate binder calcium carbonate acetate , sevelamer , aluminum hydroxide lanthanum carbonate manage treat hyperphosphatemia . Lanthanum carbonate newly available phosphate binding agent effective management hyperphosphatemia prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism . It work gastrointestinal tract bind phosphorus diet . ESRD patient take lanthanum carbonate counsel chew tablet completely swallow , immediately meal . However , patient intubate receive nutrition via feed tube unable chew tablet . For patient , medication commonly crush administered via tube . Moreover , patient prefer crush tablet mix food instead chew . To date , know crush lanthanum carbonate tablet prior administration take food would effective chewing . The purpose study compare efficacy phosphate binding chew crushed lanthanum carbonate tablet .</brief_summary>
