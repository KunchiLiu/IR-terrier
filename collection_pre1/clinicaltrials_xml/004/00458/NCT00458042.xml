	<brief_title>Transitioning To IV Remodulin From Ventavis Patients With PAH : Safety , Efficacy Treatment Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , define elevation pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary vascular resistance , severe hemodynamic abnormality common variety disease syndromes . Elevation pulmonary arterial pressure cause increase right ventricular afterload , impair right ventricular function ultimately leading inactivity death . The goal PAH treatment lengthen survival time , ameliorate symptom PAH improve quality life ( QOL ) . Remodulin ( treprostinil sodium ) , prostacyclin analog , possess potent pulmonary systemic vasodilatory platelet anti-aggregatory action vitro vivo . Remodulin approve pharmacotherapy PAH deliver either continuous subcutaneous infusion intravenous infusion . Ventavis ( iloprost ) inhale prostacyclin analogue similar property Remodulin . In December 2004 , Ventavis approve use United States FDA treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension ( WHO Group I ) patient NYHA III IV symptom . As PAH community gain experience use inhale Ventavis , question arise transition patient inhale Ventavis Remodulin presence worsen symptoms patient 's request relate dissatisfaction frequency daily treatment . This study examine effect switch Ventavis IV Remodulin compare change exercise capacity , safety , HRQOL treatment satisfaction . Participation last 12 week . Study procedure include routine blood test , medical history , physical exam , disease evaluation , exercise test patient questionnaire . Participates 4 clinic visit study spend least one night hospital .</detailed_description>
