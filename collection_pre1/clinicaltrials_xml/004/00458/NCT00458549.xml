	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Polyunsaturated fatty acid important normal growth development . One type , call omega-3 fatty acid ( find fish , fish oil , food ) , may affect growth prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study polyunsaturated fatty acid treat patient prostate cancer undergo prostate biopsy and/or surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare fatty acid analysis red blood cell , level eIF2α phosphorylation , tumor differentiation grade , measure Gleason score , patient undergo prostate biopsy . ( Part 1 ) - Determine neoadjuvant n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) induce phosphorylation eIF2α patient . ( Part 2 ) - Compare eIF2α phosphorylation , Gleason score , time prostate-specific antigen failure prostate tumor sample obtain Gelb Center Dana-Farber Cancer Institute prostate tissue repository . ( Part 3 ) OUTLINE : This prospective study , follow randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , follow retrospective study . - Part 1 : Patients undergo tumor biopsy blood sample collection baseline . Samples analyze gas-liquid chromatography determination n-3 n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) red cell membrane concentration . Biopsy sample analyze eIF2α phosphorylation immunohistochemistry . Some patient proceed part 2 . - Part 2 : Patients undergo blood sample part 1 additional tumor blood collection day 28 . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral n-3 PUFAs ( fish oil ) daily 28 day prior tumor resection . - Arm II ( control ) : Patients receive oral n-6 PUFAs ( corn oil ) daily 28 day prior tumor resection . - Part 3 : Tumor sample associate pathology data ( Gleason score ) clinical data ( PSA value patient 's outcome ) obtain prostate tissue repository Gelb Center Dana-Farber Cancer Institute . Samples analyze correlate eIF2α phosphorylation , Gleason score , time PSA failure . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 600 patient 1,000 stored tissue sample accrue study .</detailed_description>
