	<brief_summary>In previous study Methacholine Challenge Tests ( MCT ) preschool child , find wheeze detection associate significant reduction flow vital capacity value .

	<brief_title>Body Plethysmograph Measurements Before After Methacholine Challenge Early Childhood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In young child perform adequately spirometry methacholine challenge test ( MCT ) continue follow clinical signal occur : appearance audible wheeze , fall &gt; 5 % O2-saturation , increase &gt; 50 % respiratory rate and/or heart rate . In previous study [ 1 ] assessed feasibility determine PC20-FEV1 relation audible wheeze detection MCT asthmatic preschool child . We find end test ( EOT ) , reduction flow force expiratory flow volume ( FEFV ) curve accompany reduction force vital capacity ( FVC ) though reduction flow high reduction volume . We hypothesize find associate trapped-air rather child 's loss cooperation concentration . We also think determine lung volume whole body plethysmograpy , advantage measure airway resistance relation FRC . Hence , plethysmographic measurement lung volume MCT may shed light physiological relation airway obstruction hyperinflation end MCT audible wheeze detect . However , plethysmography require patient 's cooperation coordination perform brief pant maneuver close airway . So far , airway resistance measure plethysmograph [ 10 ] , believe young child comply occlusion need lung volume measurement within plethysmograph . The aims present study twofold : ) test young child capable perform plethysmographic maneuver require FRC measurement ; b ) investigate reduction vital capacity maximal reduction flow FEFV curve , find wheeze detection MCT , due true elevation FRC air trap , artificially related patient ’ loss motivation/cooperation . Methods : Lung volumes airway resistance measure commercial , whole body ZAN500 constant volume body plethysmograph ( ZAN-Messgeraete GmbH , Germany ) . The plethysmograph equip graphic display preschool child increase cooperation . The chair adjust child comfortably sit straight nose-clip , reach mouthpiece without flex neck . The plethysmography procedure perform accord recommendation . The test event explain child detail outside plethysmograph . After , measurement carry sequence explain child . FRC measure allow 2-3 breathing attempt series superimpose straight line ( separate thermal drift ) . The best test two technically accepted series analyze . MCT perform accord ATS guideline Methacholine Challenge Test . Tests perform designated room Pediatric Pulmonary Unit , Meyer Children ’ Hospital , Haifa , Israel . A parent investigate team present throughout test . Tests perform triple dos fresh Methacholine solution ( 0.057 to13.395 mg/ml ) dissolve saline . Solutions driven KoKo-PDS dosimeter ( Ferraris Respiratory , Louisville , CO ) via mouthpiece child sit upright nose-clip breathing least 10 deep breath . Five-minute interval take concentration maximal concentration end point reach ( see ) . Oxygen saturation heart-rate monitor continuously pulse-oximetry ( Ohmeda Biox 3700 Pulse Oximeter , USA ) . Auscultation 20-seconds trachea two zone lung ( upper front lower back ) perform accord recommendation . The following index consider EOT : appearance audible wheeze , fall 5 % O2-saturation , increase 50 % respiratory rate and/or heart rate . Nebulized Albuterol ( 2.5mg ) administrate lung function measurement . Spirometry : FEFV curve measure KoKo PDS commercial spirometer ( Ferraris Respiratory , Louisville , CO ) , use program incentive target ( peak expiratory flow rate vital capacity ) . Calibration perform testing session . The curve monitor computer screen ensure best effort . On-line rejection curve base publish quality control old preschool child include visual inspection `` non-cooperation '' error , include poor effort , incomplete expiration , cough glottis closure . Acceptable curve show rapid rise peak flow , gradual , smooth decline flow residual volume . Sequence lung function test : Baseline measurement include spirometry follow plethysmography . After baseline measurement MCT perform . A duplicate spirometry set perform immediately auscultation interval inhalation . Plethysmography repeat follow last spirometry EOT auscultation .</detailed_description>
