	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Lansoprazole Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) impact 1:2500 Caucasian newborn result defect cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel ( CFTR ) responsible electrolyte regulation . Between 25 81 % CF population gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) frequently prescribe condition . Moreover , PPIs commonly use patient CF allow good gastric acid stabilization pancreatic enzyme efficacy optimize nutritional status improve . Lansoprazole PPI widely use acid-related disorder include GERD . The disposition number drug report altered CF . Changes pharmacokinetic parameter observe patient CF include increase volume distribution increase clearance renally eliminate drug . To date , pharmacokinetics PPIs patient CF characterize . This study pilot study evaluate compare pharmacokinetics single dose IV lansoprazole CF normal child 2 &lt; 10 year age . A goal 12 evaluable subject range 2 &lt; 10 year age include male female CF ∆F508 genotype recruit CF clinic inpatient . As comparison group , six evaluable subject normal , healthy child similar demographic profile ( age , gender , race ) recruit . After informed consent/assent obtain , screen procedure complete within 30 day study participation . The pre-study screen include age-appropriate physical exam , medical history ( current medication/herbal use ) , vital sign ( non-crying sit blood pressure heart rate ) , height , weight , AST , ALT , CBC . Subjects study current hospitalization schedule approximately 12-hour study visit .</detailed_description>
