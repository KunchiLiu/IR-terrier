	<brief_title>Evaluation Adherence Therapeutic Effectiveness Bi-Flex Versus CPAP Children With OSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY RATIONALE The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) affect approximately 2 % child result significant morbidity . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) standard therapy child fail tonsillectomy adenoidectomy , surgery indicate . However , CPAP uncomfortable often tolerated child . Thus , comfortable technology would enhance adherence would highly desirable . This proposal aim compare new technology , Bi-Flex , standard CPAP therapy . Bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) : Whereas conventional CPAP therapy delivers constant , steady pressure inspiration expiration , BiPAP therapy intend respond inspiration expiration patient deliver set amount pressure patient begin spontaneous inhalation , decrease pressure exhalation begin . Exhaling low pressure think comfortable patient continuous pressure deliver conventional CPAP therapy , although show objectively improve adherence . The BiPAP waveform fix provide set inspiratory expiratory pressure . For example , patient 's clinically prescribe BiPAP pressure may set Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure ( IPAP ) =12 cm water ( H2O ) , Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure ( EPAP ) = 8 cm H2O . The Bi-FlexÂ® feature provide variation conventional BiPAP provide reduction inspiratory positive airway pressure ( IPAP ) provide toward end inspiratory portion breathe cycle patient 's inspiratory airflow normally diminishes , compare level pressure provide majority inspiration , also allow reduction expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) initial portion exhalation compare provide latter portion expiration . The purpose modification provide pressure relief patient smooth transition period end IPAP begin EPAP allow comfortable delivery PAP therapy . Because Bi-Flex provide low expiratory pressure pressure relief , potential comfortable mode positive pressure therapy delivery available , therefore improve adherence . However , study adherence therapy use Bi-Flex either child adult . STUDY OBJECTIVES 1 . To determine whether BiPAP Bi-Flex compare CPAP result improvement adherence &gt; 30 minute night average 3 month home use . 2 . To determine whether BiPAP Bi-Flex compare CPAP result low study dropout rate . 3 . To determine whether Bi-Flex similar therapeutic efficacy compare CPAP , determine polysomnographic measurement OSAS . 4 . To determine whether Bi-Flex , compare CPAP , result improve subjective comfort improve quality life . 5 . To determine whether objective parameter ( include demographic polysomnographic variable ) subjective parameter predict adherence . STUDY DESIGN This 3-month , double-blinded , randomized trial BiPAP Bi-Flex v CPAP child OSAS CPAP medically indicate Subjects undergo baseline diagnostic sleep study part routine clinical care , prior study enrollment . Those agree participate consent assented participate study . They randomize either Bi-Flex CPAP treatment arm , three one fashion . In arm , subject undergo clinical Bi-Flex CPAP titration sleep study . Following study , subject arm ask use respective machine , either BiPAP Bi-Flex CPAP mode , home 3 month . During time , monthly visit assess adherence well subjective measure comfort quality life . A repeat sleep study perform end 3 month mode assign ( Bi-Flex CPAP ) . Subjects complete standardized questionnaire regard symptom quality life throughout study . EFFICACY EVALUATIONS Adherence assess mean nightly usage determine equipment compliance record . Drop-out assess determine subject use device &lt; 2 hour night . Efficacy treatment assess use polysomnographic parameter apnea hypopnea index . SAFETY EVALUATIONS Polysomnographic parameter apnea hypopnea index , arterial oxygen saturation end-tidal PCO2 monitor . STATISTICAL AND ANALYTIC PLAN The primary effectiveness endpoint hour device use per night three month period , determine equipment software . Analysis Populations Two analysis population evaluate . An intent-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis include patient trial assign treatment use effectiveness safety . For patient miss data , value impute describe . A second analysis do evaluable patient , i.e. , complete data patient evaluate effectiveness . Primary Safety Analysis The rate adverse event compare two group assess proportion subject experience least one adverse event Fisher 's exact test . If test statistically significant , univariate analysis follow multivariate logistic regression analysis . Screening possible covariates do method similar describe Hosmer Lemeshow 25 logistic regression model . A complete list clinically relevant variable screen provide detailed statistical analysis plan formulate prior database lock include age , gender , height , weight , others . The variable list augment variable find balance treatment group comparability analysis describe . Models fit possible covariate include treatment , covariate , interaction covariate treatment use . Any covariate interaction significant P-value 0.15 low screening analysis allow variable enter backward elimination procedure final model . If interaction significant , covariate interaction need include model . The backward elimination do manually start interaction high P-value . Interaction term remove model first non-significant main effect . Variables retain model P-value variable interaction 0.05 less . This analysis intend demonstrate treatment affect adjust possible covariates still statistically significant . Secondary Safety Analyses The secondary safety analysis include descriptive presentation individual adverse event test Fisher 's exact test . Serious adverse event present separately narratives event . Primary Effectiveness Analysis The primary effectiveness variable hour use per night three month . This variable summarized mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum . The one-sided low 95 % confidence interval compute Bi-Flex treated subject upper one-sided 95 % confidence interval compute CPAP treat subject . These two interval visually compare determine either interval excludes mean treatment . Such exclusion provide suggestive evidence Bi-Flex treatment lead high compliance CPAP treatment . Further , mixed model analysis hour use do three month . This multivariate analysis incorporate clinically important covariates screen variable inclusion manner similar described . Screening possible covariates do method similar describe Hosmer Lemeshow 25 logistic regression model discuss . The set potential covariates describe safety analysis screen . Models fit possible covariate include treatment , covariate , interaction covariate treatment use . Any covariate interaction significant P-value 0.15 low screening analysis allow variable enter backward elimination procedure final model . If interaction significant , covariate interaction need include model . The backward elimination do manually start interaction high P-value . Interaction term remove model first non-significant main effect . Variables retain model P-value variable interaction 0.05 less . This analysis intend demonstrate treatment affect adjust possible covariates still statistically significant . Secondary Effectiveness Analyses The drop rate compare two group estimate . The rate group tabulate compute 95 % exact binomial confidence interval . The objective sleep parameter Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) , arterial oxygen saturation nadir , time elevate end-tidal partial pressure Carbon Dioxide ( PCO2 ) arousal index present descriptively treatment group . The table include mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum . The subjective sleep measure OSA 18 score , modify Epworth Sleepiness Scale , NOSE , pediatric quality life index ( PedQL ) present descriptively treatment group . The table include mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum . Additional Analysis Exploratory analyse relationship study variable outcomes do determine treatment difference particularly strong specific sub-groups . Patient Accountability Missing Data The number proportion patient eligible compliant follow-up examination present . Patients withdraw study tabulate reason withdrawal . If proportion patient withdraw large 15 % either arm , analysis demographic prognostic characteristic make patient withdraw remain study . For continuous variable , parametric non-parametric analysis variance use . For categorical variable , Chi-square Fisher 's exact test apply . The evaluation withdrawn patient present special concern . All clinical study analyze result base evaluable patient , i.e. , complete study . Because withdrawn patient final data , present problem . The statistical community 26-29 recommend multiple sensitivity analysis conduct determine robustness result patient complete study . The intention analyse demonstrate result obtain evaluable patient bias . As result , sensitivity analysis use multiple imputation analysis conduct evaluate robustness study result account miss observation . The imputation non-parametric multiple imputation patient withdraw study randomly assign outcomes group demographic prognostic characteristic include treatment assignment maintain masking , match characteristic withdrawn patient , randomly select result miss observation result patient similar characteristic method `` hot deck '' imputation imputation regression 30 . All imputation stochastic imputation preserve variability impute value . Also , imputation do manner consistent assumption multiple imputation theory include miss random extent possible . If missing random assumption clearly violate data , procedure include selection model pattern mixture modeling consider . Detailed Analysis Plan Prior database lock detail statistical analysis plan write provide detailed description statistical analysis use final analysis . This plan incorporate list relevant clinical variable test possible covariates incorporate protocol change would affect analysis . Statistical Software The statistical analysis do use SAS version 9.1 later , statistical software ( StatXact Version 7 later , Systat 10 later ) . Each software package provide special feature exploit provide comprehensive analysis excellent graphic support .</detailed_description>
