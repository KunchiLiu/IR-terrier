	<brief_summary>We would like patient research study determine safety effectiveness special cell may make immune system fight cancer . To , put special gene cancer cell take patient body . This do laboratory . This gene make cell produce interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , natural substance may help immune system kill cancer cell . Additionally , stimulate cancer cell normal embryonic fibroblast ( cell develop normal connective tissue body ) make another natural protein call CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) . Studies cancer animal suggest IL-2 performs well mixed CD40L . Some cell put back patient body goal act like vaccine stimulate immune system attack CLL cell . Studies cancer animal cancer cell grown laboratory suggest combine substance like IL-2 CD40L cancer cell help body recognize kill cancer cell . We already conduct study similar patient CLL . In study , subject receive three month injection ( shot ) . In subject saw change subject 's immune system might indicate modify cell help immune system fight cancer . However , subject change immune system go away injection stop . In study want see make change immune system last longer give injection longer period time . We hope might produce good response direct CLL cell . We also look effect cell call cancer stem cell grow CLL cell see blood . Specifically , study allow subject receive injection one year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previously , cancer cell take patient body separate laboratory specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry IL-2 gene put cell . Adenovirus common virus find human respiratory system . In normal state , reproduce cause respiratory infection . Respiratory illness cause adenovirus infection range common cold pneumonia , croup bronchitis . This adenovirus change laboratory likely reproduce cause infection patient body . The gene transfer method use study try add copy IL2 gene increase immune response tumor . The rest cancer cell stimulate express surface substance call human CD40L . These substance ( IL-2 CD40L ) , already naturally present patient body , mean help immune system fight cancer . In study , modify cancer cell inject skin . The patient normally shots outpatient . The patient receive first eight ( 8 ) shot 1-2 week interval . They receive four ( 4 ) shot 4 weekly interval . After first twelve shot , assess cancer respond modify cell . If cancer get bad , patient may receive additional six ( 6 ) shot . These shot give 4 weekly interval . In total , patient may receive eighteen ( 18 ) shot period one year . These shot must give Methodist Hospital . Following injection , patient see yearly check-ups 2 year first injection . TESTS DURING AND AFTER EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT : A complete history physical examination necessary patient enrol study . A physical examination also perform time receive shot modify cell . The place body patient receive shot examine physical exam . As mentioned , patient yearly checkups 2 year first injection . After , call patient physician updates patient health . These call make annually 5 year first injection . To study modified cell work body , take blood sample prior shot , every four week six month last injection , 2 year first injection . The amount blood obtain test approximately 2-3 tablespoonful , consider safe amount . If patient central line ( IV line place large blood vessel mean use long periods time ) , blood take , extra `` stick '' need . Additional office visit may necessary obtain blood . The maximum total amount blood collect patient 78 tablespoon .</detailed_description>
