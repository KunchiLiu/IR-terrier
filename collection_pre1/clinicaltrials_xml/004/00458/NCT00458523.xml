	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , alemtuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well alemtuzumab work treat patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia partial remission complete remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Treating Patients With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Partial Remission Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine rate achieve minimum residual disease ( MRD ) negativity treatment alemtuzumab patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) low level MRD conventional therapy relapse MRD level prior MRD-negative remission . - Determine safety alemtuzumab patient treat MRD-positive setting . Secondary - Determine clinical response patient treated drug . - Determine time MRD relapse patient treat drug . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine effect drug administer consolidation/maintenance therapy CD52 expression CLL cell . - Determine safety efficacy repeat drug dosing require achieve sustain MRD negativity patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Observation : Patients minimal residual disease ( MRD ) -negative status observe every 4 week 12 week every 12 week thereafter . If become MRD-positive , eligible treatment . - Treatment : Patients MRD-positive status receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously IV 2 hour three time weekly 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 week study therapy , patient evaluate response . Patients remain MRD-positive responding study therapy receive additional 6 week treatment . Patients remain MRD-positive show significant improvement level leukemic cell detect peripheral blood bone marrow remove study . Patients achieve MRD-negative remission remove study therapy monitor disease recurrence MRD level . If MRD-level relapse confirm patient , may retreat alemtuzumab provide initial response therapy last least 6 month . Patients undergo collection peripheral blood bone marrow periodically study assessment MRD MRD flow cytometry , fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis , somatic mutation analysis , B-cell selection . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 54 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
