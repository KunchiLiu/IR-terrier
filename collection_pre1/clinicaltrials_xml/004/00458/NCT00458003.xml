	<brief_summary>Hypotension remain common clinical problem induction spinal anesthesia cesarean delivery . Maternal hypotension associate considerable morbidity ( maternal nausea vomit fetal/neonatal acidemia ) . Traditionally , ephedrine vasopressor choice concern phenylephrine 's potential adverse effect uterine blood flow . This practice base animal study show ephedrine maintain cardiac output uterine blood flow , direct act vasoconstrictor , e.g. , phenylephrine , decrease uteroplacental perfusion . However , several recent study demonstrate phenylephrine similar efficacy ephedrine prevent treat hypotension may associate low incidence fetal acidosis . All study perform healthy patient undergo elective cesarean delivery . Preeclampsia complicate 5-6 % pregnancy significant contributor maternal fetal morbidity mortality . Many preeclamptic patient require cesarean delivery infant . These patient often uteroplacental insufficiency . Given potential significant hypotension spinal anesthesia effect already compromise fetus , prevention ( relative ) hypotension preeclamptic patient important . Spinal anesthesia preeclamptic patient show adverse neonatal outcome compare epidural anesthesia hypotension treat adequately . Due problem related management difficult airway coagulopathy , common preeclamptic woman , spinal anesthesia may prefer regional anesthesia technique . Recent study demonstrate preeclamptic patient may experience less hypotension spinal anesthesia healthy counterpart . To knowledge , phenylephrine treatment spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension study woman preeclampsia . The aim study compare intravenous infusion regimen phenylephrine versus ephedrine treatment spinal anesthesia induce hypotension preeclamptic patient undergo cesarean delivery . The primary outcome variable umbilical artery pH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study approve Northwestern University Institutional Review Board . Eligible woman admit Labor Delivery Unit Prentice Women 's Hospital approach study participation immediately routine preanesthetic evaluation . This usually occur shortly admission Labor Delivery Unit . Women agree participate give write , inform consent time . Preparation initiation spinal anesthesia proceed accord routine practice institution . A 16-gauge IV catheter insert local anesthesia pre-operative labor delivery suite . An IV infusion lactate Ringer 's solution start minimal rate maintain vein patency . Patients premedicated metoclopramide 10 mg ranitidine 50 mg IV least 30 minute prior procedure aspiration prophylaxis . Patients allow rest undisturbed several minute leave lateral tilt position , heart rate ( HR ) systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) take every 1-2 minute least 3 measurement . Baseline HR SBP mean three recording . The subject randomize accord computer-generated randomization table one two group : Group 1 receive phenylephrine infusion Group 2 receive ephedrine infusion . All study medication prepare investigator involve care patient collection data . Both anesthesiologist manage patient 's anesthetic , well patient , blind study medication . Upon arrival operating room , 30 mL 0.3 M sodium citrate give orally standard monitoring perform , include non-invasive BP , electrocardiography pulse oximetry . Oxygen give 3 liter per minute nasal cannula . Fetal heart rate monitor external cardiotocography time surgical preparation . 500 mL lactate Ringer 's solution give bolus concurrently start spinal anesthesia procedure . Spinal anesthesia induce patient sit position . After sterile skin preparation draping , skin infiltrate lidocaine , 25 gauge Whitacre needle insert L3-L4 vertebral interspace ( ± one vertebral interspace ) bupivacaine 0.75 % , 1.6 mL ( 12 mg ) , fentanyl 15 μg morphine 150 μg inject intrathecally . Patients immediately place supine left uterine displacement . SBP measure every 1 minute begin 1 minute spinal injection 10 minute , every 2.5 minute remainder procedure . Patients ' hemodynamic data record throughout procedure print end surgery . Five minute spinal injection , sensory level anesthesia assess loss pinprick discrimination use von Frey hair . If patient fails obtain least T6 sensory level anesthesia , patient withdrawn study . Preincision antibiotic , magnesium sulfate uterotonic agent administer intraoperatively per routine practice . An unblinded investigator prepare solution phenylephrine 100 μg per mL ephedrine 8000 μg per mL ( potency phenylephrine : ephedrine 80:111 ) . The investigator place 20 mL study medication syringe give manage anesthesiologist infusion via syringe pump . The infusion attach IV cannula distal . The infusion initiate immediately completion spinal injection rate 1 mL per minute continue minimum two minute infusion either stop , continue increase base SBP measurement minute . The goal maintain SBP ≥ 80 % baseline , &gt; 160 mmHg . After measurement SBP , infusion stop SBP great 80 % baseline SBP , infusion continue restart SBP approximately equal 80 % baseline SBP.12 The infusion increase 1 mL per minute SBP measurement le 80 % baseline . For purpose study , define hypotension decrease SBP &lt; 80 % baseline.13 Each time SBP measurement demonstrate hypotension define , patient receive 1 mL IV bolus study solution via infusion pump infusion increase 1 mL per minute . The infusion bolus protocol continue delivery , management discretion manage anesthesiologist maintain SBP . If baseline SBP &gt; 160 mmHg , infusion start SBP decrease 160 mmHg . Infusion management proceed describe . The total volume study solution give infusion bolus time delivery record . Bradycardia ( define HR &lt; 60 bpm ) associate SBP equal great baseline SBP treat stop study solution bradycardia associate SBP &lt; 80 % baseline treat atropine intravenously . Hypotension unresponsive study medication treat epinephrine ( 10 μg/mL ) intravenous bolus ( 1 mL ) correction hypotension . Nausea vomit associate hypotension treat ondansetron 4 mg IV . After delivery , oxytocin 10-20 IU give slow IV infusion per routine . The infant 's 1 5 minute Apgar score assess nurse pediatrician blind patient group . The result routine umbilical cord blood gas analysis record .</detailed_description>
