	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) explore area brain involve different type mental process , particular , brain region involve perception , recognition , learning , memory . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . In study also use measure blood flow different region brain subject present auditory visual stimulus . The subject lie table slide scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan process . Subjects scanner 2 hour . Healthy , right-handed normal volunteer 20 40 year age least high school education may eligible study . While undergo MRI , participant present visual stimulus ( picture geometric shape projection screen ) auditory stimulus ( tone play set headphone ) . Unpleasant stimuli loud noise , electric shock , heat , tactile stimulus administer occasionally . The intensity stimuli similar experienced practice session scan . Participants receive 30 60 visual auditory stimulus scan session , stimulus last 1 second . In study participant ask move joystick control rating bar present projection screen indicate expect receive stimuli sure occur . Heart rate , respiration rate , sweat gland activity monitor MRI session , use electrode place finger measure heart rate sweat gland activity sensor strap around chest measure respiration . Subjects scanner 2 hour . Following experiment , subject may ask question experience study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term goal study understand neural substrate aversive Pavlovian conditioning human subject . The general approach use whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) describe brain region circuit contribute acquisition performance form learning . The specific aim proposal : 1 . To identify brain region respond aversive stimulus . 2 . To identify brain region primarily responsible expression cognitive autonomic response versus involved stimulus process memory encode . 3 . To relate pattern activity within select brain area implicit versus explicit memory performance . 4 . To compare parallel development implicit explicit knowledge stimulus relationship Pavlovian delay trace fear conditioning . 5 . To test specific prediction regard nature learning-related activity amygdala , hippocampus , anterior cingulate , prefrontal cortex develop condition integrate finding general theoretical understand memory phenomena human .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal righthanded volunteer least high school education , age 20 40 year , recruit participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude evidence history learn disability , psychiatric condition , head trauma , seizures neurological condition , alcoholism substance abuse , hypertension , cardiovascular disease . We also exclude subject vision and/or hear problem severe enough interfere test . Lab work limit urine pregnancy test female . Females positive pregnancy test exclude neuroimaging study . All subject question prior MRI scan possible occupational exposure metal sliver shaving , may become accidentally lodged tissue head neck . Those whose history suggestive problem exclude . Subjects surgical clip shrapnel near brain blood vessel , subject cochlear implant , subject metallic body eye CNS , subject form implant wire metal device may concentrate radiofrequency field exclude possible risk MRI scanning .</criteria>
