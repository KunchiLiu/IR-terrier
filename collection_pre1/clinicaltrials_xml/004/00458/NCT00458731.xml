	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose bevacizumab cediranib maleate treat patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor , lymphoma , intracranial glioblastoma , gliosarcoma anaplastic astrocytoma . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Cediranib maleate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab cediranib maleate may also stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Giving bevacizumab together cediranib maleate may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity profile intravenous bevacizumab ( avastin ) administer combination oral AZD2171 ( cediranib maleate ) patient advanced malignancy . II . To determine pharmacokinetic profile oral AZD2171 combination bevacizumab ( avastin ) administer patient advanced malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate serum concentration Nitric Oxide ( NO ) Nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) among patient treat regimen correlate VEGF expression . II . To determine change tumor vasculature detect DCE-MRI among patient treat combination VEGF receptor block agent . III . To evaluate potential predictive role angiogenesis molecular endpoint malignant effusion sample . IV . To assess descriptive fashion efficacy study regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 oral cediranib maleate daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bevacizumab cediranib maleate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Blood sample acquire baseline , day 2 , 2 course treatment pharmacokinetic study . Samples analyze TUNEL , immunofluorescence staining , laser-scanning cytometry , flow cytometry , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , immunohistochemistry assess apoptosis tumor endothelial cell , microvessel density mean vessel volume , nitric oxide concentration , signal transduction pathway ( i.e. , ERK ½ , P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase , protein kinase B , circulate endothelial progenitor cell , basic fibroblast growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor phosphorylation , VEGF , hypoxia inducible factor-1α ) . Some patient also undergo tissue biopsy baseline 2 course treatment characterization vascular angiogenesis marker . Some patient also undergo DCE-MRI baseline , day 22-24 , every 2 course treatment assess blood perfusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week .</detailed_description>
