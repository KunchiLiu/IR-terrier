	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy , safety tolerability darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg day ( O.D . ) monotherapy versus triple combination therapy contain 2 nucleoside darunavir/ritonavir 250 HIV-1 infected patient Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) plasma viral load 50 copies/ml least 24 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Simplification Darunavir/Ritonavir 800/100 mg Once Day Versus Triple Combination Therapy With Darunavir/Ritonavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomise ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , control , open-label trial compare efficacy , safety tolerability darunavir/ritonavir ( DRV/r ) 800/100 mg day ( O.D . ) monotherapy versus triple combination therapy contain 2 nucleoside DRV/r 250 HIV-1 infected patient . Patients consider eligible changed antiretroviral drug least 8 week prior screen document evidence plasma viral load ( plasma HIV-1 RNA ) &lt; 50 copies/mL least 24 week prior screen . The trial consist screen period 4 week , 48-week treatment period , follow 4-week follow-up ( FU ) period . The primary objective demonstrate non-inferiority efficacy DRV/r versus triple combination therapy contain DRV/r , respect confirm virologic response , define plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL 48 weeks.Patients assign study medication base 1:1 ratio either switch triple combination therapy contain 2 nucleoside DRV/r 800/100 mg O.D , initiate monotherapy DRV/r 800/100 mg O.D . Patients triple combination arm already 2 nucleoside prior randomisation may remain switch baseline . Patients randomise monotherapy arm discontinue Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) baseline commence DRV/r 800/100 mg O.D . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) commission study . The role DSMB review progress trial accumulate data detect evidence early safety issue patient trial ongoing . An interim analysis perform 24 week treatment . The result Week 24 analysis use determine whether long-term follow-up 72 96 week do . The protease inhibitor ( PI ) component regimen change end treatment period nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) modify end treatment period follow exception : single antiretroviral ( ARV ) substitution allow tolerability/toxicity reason , long link adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) . After withdrawal patient trial , change ARV regimen allow assessment withdrawal visit perform . Temporary interruption ARVs allow event suspect toxicity , long temporary interruption associate link AE SAE . For control arm , nucleoside analogue could re-optimized baseline study , approve ARVs allow . However , PIs DRV/r allow treatment period . Patients resume study medication withdrawn . A physical examination do protocol-scheduled visit vital sign monitor study visit . In addition , study visit , every patient ask occurrence change AEs since last see investigator . Laboratory sample haematology serum chemistry drawn result determine transmitted investigator . Urinalysis perform . Pregnancy test do visit female participant child-bearing potential . The primary endpoint proportion virologic response , define confirm plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL Week 48.The study hypothesis DRV/r monotherapy effective triple combination regimen well tolerate early pre-treated HIV-1 patient . Two 400mg tablet darunavir daily orally within 30 minute completion meal 48 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients document HIV1 infection Patients currently receive HAART least 24 week Plasma viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL least 24 week prior screen ( two result must document ) Patients take antiretroviral combination least 8 week screen Patients physician 's preference change current HAART regimen reason simplification and/or toxicity CD4 &gt; 100/mm3 start HAART &gt; 200/mm3 screening . No history virological failure define two consecutive plasma HIV1 RNA &gt; 500 copies/mL previous current antiretroviral therapy No history primary PI mutation define IASUSA guideline 2006 No patient coinfected hepatitis B No pregnant breastfeed woman No active clinically significant disease life threaten disease finding screen medical history physical examination , investigator 's opinion , would compromise patient 's safety outcome study .</criteria>
