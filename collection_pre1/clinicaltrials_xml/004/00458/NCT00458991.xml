	<brief_title>rhGH Therapy Hepatic Drug Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth Hormone ( GH ) deficiency prominent cause short stature , affect approximately 14,000 child US . Although single study demonstrate reduces CYP1A2 activity follow Gh replacement therapy , effect GH abundant phase 1 biotransformation pathway ( e.g . CYP2D6 CYP3A4 ) remain largely uncharacterized . This information gap exist largely due lack sufficiently safe , specific non-invasive method appropriate longitudinal evaluation enzyme activity young child . We overcome problem employ validate phenotyping method use caffeine , commonly ingest dietary substance dextromethorphan , safe , non-sedating counter anti-tussive agent . Application method permit u identify , characterize describe isoform-specific effect rhGH major phase 1 hepatic drug biotransformation pathway , thereby address information gap minimal risk child .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children age 4 14 year height less 5th percentile age sex decelerate across two major percentile ( 5th , 10th , 25th , 50th , 90th , 95th ) standard pediatric growth curve , poor growth velocity ( le 5 centimeters/year ) , radiographic evidence delay bone age ( i.e . great 1 SD mean chronological age ) document diagnosis idiopathic growth hormone deficiency [ determine failure raise serum GH concentration 10 microgram/Liter follow provocative test two growth hormone secretagogues ( e.g . insulin , arginine , clonidine ) ] . All subject prepubertal , determine Tanner stag . Children receive medication know induce inhibit hepatic CYP1A2 , NAT2 , XO , CYP2D6 CYP3A4 activity . Subjects history smoking ( include exposure second hand smoke &gt; 8 hour per day ) illicit drug use . Subjects history hepatic , renal , cardiac thyroid disorder . Presence hepatic , renal , cardiac thyroid disease establish base clinical history result recent laboratory test conduct part routine medical evaluation child consider rhGH therapy . Children experience fever acute viral illness Children history hypersensitivity reaction dextromethorphan caffeine Children receive prior treatment rhGH Children receive corticosteroid thyroid hormone</criteria>
