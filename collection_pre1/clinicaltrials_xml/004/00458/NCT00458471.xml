	<brief_summary>The overall goal project develop new approach prevention urinary tract infection ( UTI ) person rely indwell catheter bladder drainage . Veterans spinal cord injury ( SCI ) frequently require chronic bladder catheterization . Most individual SCI neurogenic bladder , result urinary stasis bladder catheterization predispose recurrent UTI.1 The presence urinary catheter dramatically increase risk UTI , contamination urinary tract catheter change , also presence foreign body urethra bladder . Implanted urinary catheter rapidly acquire complex , three-dimensional biofilm compose bacteria , extracellular product , component deposit bodily fluid . The pathogenic organism biofilm continually seed bladder , lead bacteriuria and/or UTI.2 Bacterial interference , use benign bacteria prevent infection virulent pathogens,3 , 4 may offer solution significant problem recurrent episodes UTI person indwell catheter . Since biofilm formation wet implant device urinary catheter nearly impossible prevent,5 , 6 propose instead manipulate adherent microbial flora . We propose insert urinary catheter pre-inoculated benign strain Escherichia coli ( 83972 ) efficient mean colonize neurogenic bladder harmless organism . If successful colonization achieve pilot trial , large clinical trial design test efficacy approach prevent bladder colonization pathogenic organism thus prevent UTI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluate urinary catheter pre-inoculated E. coli 83972 prospective clinical trial SCI patient require indwell catheter bladder drainage : 1 . Evaluate vivo safety urinary catheter pre-inoculated E. coli 83972 . 2 . Determine whether insertion catheter human subject persistently colonize neurogenic bladder E. coli 83972 . We define persistent colonization presence E. coli 83972 urine 28 day longer , person indwell catheter typically receive new catheter every 28 day . 3 . Evaluate biofilm present urinary catheter 28 day bladder use sonication culture confocal microscopy . All patient complete history physical examination , serum creatinine , plain X-ray abdomen , urine culture immediately prior entry study . Renal ultrasound urodynamic evaluation urinary tract also obtain upon study entry unless perform precede year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients follow Houston VA Medical Center ( VAMC ) sustain spinal cord injury &gt; 18 month earlier , suffer neurogenic bladder , require indwell urinary catheter ( either transurethral suprapubic ) , vesicoureteral reflux enrol . Women member minority group subpopulation include protocol . We anticipate gender minority representation match demographic mix SCI Unit Houston VAMC . We initially target inpatient enrollment simply patient â€™ convenience , low threshold enrol suitable outpatient patient discharge live close enough VAMC make home visit feasible . Include urolithiasis , indwell nephrostomy catheter , supravesical urinary diversion , vesicoureteral reflux , current antibiotic therapy , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , immunosuppression . Women childbearing age must negative pregnancy test enrol study , must utilize effective birth control method study 3 month study conclude .</criteria>
