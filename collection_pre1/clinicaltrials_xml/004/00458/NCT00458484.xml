	<brief_title>Radiosurgery Treating Patients With Kidney Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate compare clinical safety utilize four different schemes radiosurgical ablative technique treat poor surgical candidate renal tumor . Secondary - To evaluate compare clinical radiographic efficacy four different schemes radiosurgical ablation renal tumor poor surgical candidate . Serum Blood Marker Objective : - To determine serum marker collect radiation may give predictive indication tumor response . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients undergo placement 2-3 fiducial marker near renal tumor . Patients undergo 4 fraction stereotactic radiosurgery absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment may repeat 6 month tumor still present . After radio-surgery , follow-up do 1 , 3 6 month every 6 month post radiosurgery total 36 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 32 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
