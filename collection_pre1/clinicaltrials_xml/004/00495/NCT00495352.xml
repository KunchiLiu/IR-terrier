	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking represent major health problem patient suffer schizophrenia . Compared general population , schizophrenic patient significantly likely addicted nicotine . They also likely heavy smoker , tend expose disproportionately nicotine harmful ingredient cigarette observe tendency smoke end . Further , smoke patient may associate high risk develop tardive dyskinesia All factor render schizophrenic patient particularly vulnerable group detrimental effect tobacco-related medical problem . Currently , little information available regard efficacy utility smoke cessation treatment method , well factor may predict patient ' response treatment . An important related issue influence smoking , cessation , effect medication patient rely upon control psychiatric symptom . Although smoking long know significantly alter metabolism , thus effect , antipsychotic , extent clinical significance influence rarely assess . It unclear extent smoke cessation ( well initiation ) change side effect profile medication , whether change contribute towards difficulty patient ' ability and/or willingness stop smoking . In addition , except pharmacological intervention , readiness change may important factor affect outcome smoke reduction . Prochaska et al propose concept stage change predict response quit behavior substance use . A lot evidence support strong readiness change , high successful rate quit reach . Yet result largely find many non-pharmacological intervention smoke cessation program general population . Till , available study solely focus readiness change quit smoke behavior NRT treatment chronic schizophrenic patient . Thus , great interest examine association stage change outcomes smoking-cessation along reduction among schizophrenic patient receive transdermal nicotine patch . In order begin address important issue , application proposes utilize state-of-the-art methodology derive field pharmacogenetics , molecular biology clinical trial , ( 1 ) examine short-term long-term efficacy standard treatment method , use nicotine patch , population ; ( 2 ) identify factor might predict treatment response ; , ( 3 ) examine interaction smoke effect antipsychotic , well interaction might affect smoke cessation . ( 4 ) examine predictive value stage change smoke cessation reduction outcomes schizophrenic patient receive different dos nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) bupropion implement randomized trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Accordingly , proposal aim test follow major hypothesis : 1 . Nicotine patch therapy bupropion effective smoke cessation among motivated psychiatric outpatient schizophrenia . 1a . High dose nicotine patch therapy significantly effective induce smoke cessation regular dose nicotine patch therapy . 1b . Nicotine patch therapy bupropion effective induce smoke cessation treat `` atypical '' neuroleptic compare treat `` typical '' neuroleptic . 2 . Response nicotine patch therapy associate genetic polymorphism DRD2 , dopamine transporter ( DAT ; SLC6A3 ) , CYP2A6 CYP2D6 gene . 3 . Smoke cessation associate significant decrease activity CYP1A2 , well significant increase steady-state concentration neuroleptic receive patient . This lead increase incidence treatment emergent side effect , may control neuroleptic dose adjustment . 4. patient stage preparation contemplation ( strong readiness quit smoking ) likely reduce smoke stop smoking stage precontemplation ( weak readiness quit smoking ) .</detailed_description>
