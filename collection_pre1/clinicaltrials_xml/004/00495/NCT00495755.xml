	<brief_summary>The CD52 antigen , target alemtuzumab , highly express mature T lymphocytes , monocytes monocyte-derived dendritic cell well mature B cell . Due promiscuous effect immune cell , alemtuzumab target antibody produce B lymphocytes rituximab , also target alloreactive T lymphocytes dendritic cell also contribute complex pathogenesis chronic GVHD . Our hypothesis alemtuzumab effective treatment chronic GVHD promiscuous depletion alloreactive T lymphocyte , dendritic cell well antibody produce mature B-lymphocytes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I , dose escalation trial alemtuzumab patient steroid-refractory chronic GVHD . Alemtuzumab give 4-week period . Three escalate dos alemtuzumab consider determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . In design , cohort 3-6 patient treat dose level . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define life-threatening anaphylaxis due alemtuzumab infusion , grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity directly relate alemtuzumab 12 week assessment period , grade 4 hematological toxicity , grade 4 infectious complication require hospitalization . CMV reactivation secondary alemtuzumab expect complication alemtuzumab consider DLT unless grade 4 CMV disease occur . CMV DNA level closely monitor preemptive therapy CMV initiate evidence CMV reactivation . Three patient enter dose level . The dose alemtuzumab escalate 3 patient complete 4-week treatment none experience DLT week 12 therapy . If 1 3 patient treat give dose level experience DLT , 3 patient treat dose level . If incidence DLT among 6 patient 1 6 , dose escalation next high dose level occurs . If 2 6 patient treat dose level experience DLT , MTD consider exceed . At point , unless 6 patient treat previous dose level , 3 patient treated level , principle determination MTD apply . There dose escalation point , MTD dose level 1/6 subject experience DLT . Once 6 patient treated MTD , additional 10 patient treat dose level delineate toxicity efficacy dose level . Patients experience either toxicity , grade I-II toxicity resolve time clinical response assessment response partial response therapy receive second course alemtuzumab week 12 . The second course alemtuzumab 4-week course dose schedule first course treatment . Patients complete response resolution chronic GVHD retreat regardless toxicity . Patients grade IV toxicity retreat regardless response . Toxicity associate second course therapy use assessment MTD . Toxicity assessments ongoing record schedule clinical visit . Clinical response assessment do assess presence absence sign symptom GVHD completion 3 month study , week 12 . A similar series immunologic assay perform subject enrol clinical trial Specific Aim 1 . Eligible patient undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation use myeloablative non-myeloablative conditioning regimen least 180 day ( 6 month ) ago . Patients must steroid refractory chronic GVHD , define persistent sign symptom chronic GVHD despite use prednisone &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day 1 mg/kg every day least 4 week precede 12 month ( equivalent dose alternate corticosteroid ) without complete resolution sign symptom . Patients either extensive chronic GVHD limit chronic GVHD require systemic therapy eligible . Subjects must stable dos immunosuppressant corticosteroid 4 week prior enrollment , dose corticosteroid must less 2mg/kg/day prednisone use ( equivalent ) . Subjects require adequate bone marrow organ function time enrollment .</detailed_description>
