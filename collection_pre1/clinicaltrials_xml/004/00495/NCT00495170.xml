	<brief_title>Concurrent Proton Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A proton beam make charge particle well-defined range penetration tissue . How deep penetrate decide beam 's energy density tissue pass . As proton beam penetrate body , particle slow , beam deposit dose sharply near end range . This phenomenon know Bragg peak . By adjust Bragg peak , doctor deliver full , localized , uniform dose energy treatment site spar surround normal tissue . The proton beam ideal treatment organ preservation important , lung cancer . If find eligible take part study , receive 37 treatment proton radiotherapy ( Monday Friday 7 1/2 week ) . During treatment , lie still table 30-45 minute per day position . The proton machine deliver dose accord plan design physician control computer . You feel , see , smell anything proton beam delivery . While study , also receive weekly standard low-dose chemotherapy possibly follow full-dose chemotherapy . During treatment , see doctor research nurse week evaluate possible side effect . You physical exam medical history . About 2 teaspoon blood drawn routine test . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . After finish treatment , 6 week follow recommend completion radiotherapy , require every 3 month ( +1 month ) 2 year , every 6 month ( +1 month ) 3 year , year 2 year . You image test ( chest CT PET scan ) routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) follow-up visit . This investigational study . Proton radiotherapy FDA approve treatment lung cancer . A total 65 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
