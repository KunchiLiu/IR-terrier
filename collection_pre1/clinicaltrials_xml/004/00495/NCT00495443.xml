	<brief_title>Enhanced Safety Aesthetic Laser System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cosmetic laser well-established , popular modality removal unwanted hair , treatment type vascular lesion , include hemangioma , port wine stain , variety telangiectases well facial rhytides reduction . The exist laser base wavelength specifically absorb chromophore find target hair follicle , energy convert heat result thermal injury . However , laser cosmetic treatment without limitation . A laser base long-term hair removal treatment base thermal destruction hair shaft follicle use wavelength specifically absorbed pigment melanin find hair follicle . The heat hair follicle do heat dissipation hair shaft . One significant limitation approach fact epidermis light energy must penetrate rich melanin therefore absorbs major portion energy , result inadequate heating hair follicle . Similar problem exist target chromophore hemoglobin water . The purpose study evaluation safety efficacy new laser base device .</detailed_description>
