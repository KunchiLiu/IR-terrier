	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 , international , multicenter , open-label , single-arm trial evaluate Marqibo ( VSLI ) adult subject : 1 ) Ph- ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma second great relapse ; 2 ) Ph- ALL lymphoblastic lymphoma fail 2 great treatment line anti-leukemia chemotherapy . The original enrollment target study approximately 56 subject . Per protocol amendment , enrollment increase 56 65 . The primary objective study evaluate : - The efficacy study treatment determine rate CR plus CR incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) adult subject Philadelphia chromosome-negative ( Ph- ) ALL second relapse adult subject ( Ph- ) ALL fail 2 treatment line anti-leukemia chemotherapy . Subjects must achieve CR least 1 prior anti-leukemia therapy define leukemia-free interval ≥ 90 day .</brief_summary>
