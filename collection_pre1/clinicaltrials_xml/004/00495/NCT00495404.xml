	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE : Although use opioid medication gain increase acceptance treatment option chronic pain , little empirical research concern long-term outcome patient population . Several important question concern use opioids yet examine controlled study . These include : determination effective dosing regime , specification risk factor medication abuse , identification patient likely achieve long-term benefit . Despite lack empirical data , clinical literature date yield two general approach use opioid treatment chronic , nonmalignant pain . The first approach dictate due risk addiction , tolerance , insensitivity large dos , opioid medication carefully control , minimal stable dose eventual goal treatment . The second approach , foster beneficial use opioids treatment cancer pain , maintain risk addiction abuse exaggerated . Proponents approach suggest under-medication significant cause treatment failure non-compliance chronic pain patient , prescription guideline emphasize patient ' report adequate relief , regardless dosage . OBJECTIVES : The propose study test two core hypothesis : 1 ) What best overall approach long-term ( 12 month ) opioid therapy chronic pain , 2 ) Which potentially important predictor variable mention clinical opioid literature relate outcome outpatient Veteran population . RESEARCH PLAN AND METHODS : The two approach opioid use operationalized use medication prescription guideline two separate group ( Tolerable Pain Dosage v . Adequate Relief Dosage ) test randomized trial . For Tolerable Pain group , opioid medication prescribe initially low dos expectation low dose adequate reduce pain tolerable level . Dose increase do slowly base report relief low dose , goal low stable dose prevent dependence tolerance . For Adequate Relief group , opioid dosage initially rapidly increase patient indicate adequate substantial relief , point dosage stabilize . For group , tolerance dependence view sign inadequate dose handle typically dose increase . Both group share common guideline monthly monitoring , random screen drug use , prescription limit single clinic . Outcome measure respect primary outcome variable pain relief , quality life , addictive behavior , secondary outcome variable medication use , mood , illness belief , treatment satisfaction , health care utilization . These variable assess study entry , 4 month , 8 month 12 month follow-up visit . In addition , follow individual difference variable examine determine patient characteristic may impact treatment outcome : psychosocial factor ( e.g. , history substance abuse , economic status , environmental support ) , type chronicity pain problem , mood , medication use , quality life , illness impact . These variable also assess study entry 4 month , 8 month 12 month follow-up visit . PROGRESS REPORT AND CURRENT FINDINGS : Subject enrollment follow-up complete , total 135 subject enrol . Data analysis ongoing . Primary hypothesis investigate current analysis result pending .</detailed_description>
