	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn escalated/accelerated proton radiotherapy improve control Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) decrease side effect . The safety treatment also study . Objectives : To assess therapeutic efficacy toxicity proton radiotherapy escalated/accelerated dose patient medically inoperable stage I ( T1-2 , N0 , M0 ) NSCLC . Primary goal : 1 . Improve 2 year progression free survival primary site , 2. reduce acute chronic toxicity Secondary goal : 1 . Improve disease specific survival 2 year . 2 . Study potential pre- post treatment PET/CT predict clinical outcome . 3 . Study role biomarkers predict therapeutic response toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A proton beam make charge particle well-defined range penetration tissue . How deep penetrate decide beam 's energy density tissue pass . As proton beam penetrate body , particle slow , beam deposit dose sharply near end range . This phenomenon know Bragg peak . By adjust Bragg peak , doctor deliver full , localized , uniform dose energy treatment site spar surround normal tissue . The proton beam ideal treatment organ preservation important , lung cancer . Researchers know standard photon radiotherapy able adequately control tumor growth . But unfortunately , possible increase dose photon radiotherapy without also significantly increase side effect . In study , use proton radiotherapy , researcher increase dose 40 % high standard photon radiotherapy . Screening Tests Signing consent form mean able take part study . You `` screen test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test procedure perform start treatment study : Your complete medical history record . You physical exam . Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) drawn ( within 30 day ) routine blood test You compute tomography ( CT ) scan positron emission tomography ( PET/CT ) scan chest , MRI scan CT brain , You lung function test . Women able child must negative blood-pregnancy test . You 4DCT . Study Drug Administration If find eligible take part study , receive 35 treatment proton radiotherapy ( radiotherapy start Monday start Friday ; usually Monday Thursday 7 8 week ) . During treatment , lie still table 30-45 minute per day position . The proton machine deliver dose accord plan design physician control computer . You feel , see , smell anything proton beam delivery . During treatment , see doctor research nurse week evaluate possible side effect . You physical exam medical history . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . After finish treatment , follow recommend 6 week completion radiotherapy , require every 3 month ( +/-1 month ) two year , every ( +/-1 month ) 6 month three year , year 2 year . You image test ( chest CT PET scan ) , lung function test routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) follow-up visit . You allow chemotherapy treatment still follow-up study . You discuss chemotherapy medical oncologist . This investigational study . Proton radiotherapy FDA approve treatment lung cancer treatment . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
