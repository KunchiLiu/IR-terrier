	<brief_title>Comparison Nevirapine Efavirenz Treatment HIV-TB Co-infected Patients ( ANRS 12146 CARINEMO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti Retroviral Therapy ( ART ) reduce tuberculosis ( TB ) incidence HIV-infected patient reduces mortality among TB patient deep immune suppression . The Fixed Drug Combination ( FDC ) nevirapine ( NVP ) -lamivudine-stavudine first line ART available low-income country . Rifampicin ( RMP ) , due liver induction effect , reduce significantly NVP plasma concentration , raise concern regard risk resistance subsequent treatment failure . Therefore , co-infected patient , WHO recommend delay ART use efavirenz ( EFV ) -based ART . Although EFV also reduce low level , longitudinal study report good efficacy safety give concomitantly RMP . In low-income country , poor access EFV , contradiction pregnancy absence FDC contain EFV lead difficulty HIV-TB treatment . Despite 2 limited retrospective study non-randomised prospective study , report good virological response 6 month co-infected patient receive NVP RMP co-administration , exist data limit change recommendation . The aim study compare , term therapeutic efficacy clinical safety , nevirapine-based HAART standard efavirenz-based HAART , HIV/TB co-infected patient receive rifampicin-based TB treatment . The study evaluate one year TB treatment initiation , whether HAART efficacy ( virological outcome , death lose follow-up ) induce NVP-based HAART non-inferior induce EFV base HAART , patient receive concomitantly HAART RMP-based TB treatment .</detailed_description>
