	<brief_summary>Caries mean demineralization formation cavity pulp symptom necrosis end result . The acid mouth mainly produce oral bacteria like Streptococcus mutans bacterial biofilms adhere tooth . Ozone show strong bactericidal effect bacteria cause dental caries . Baysan et al report statistically significant reduction streptococci root caries lesion saliva sample ozone application . The positive clinical effect ozone respect arrest caries progression remineralization caries show vitro vivo . In vivo study , Baysan Lynch find application ozone result significant reduction bacterial contamination well reduction size severity root caries lesion . In subsequent study , Baysan Lynch report severity root caries lesion significantly reduce ozone application measure electrical conductance laser fluorescence . In several study , caries reduce effect ozone measure biochemical method root surface caries lesion , biofilm saliva ozone application . See Citation section reference . The objective multi-center clinical study determine : ( 1 ) effectiveness HealOzone stop progression fissure caries ; ( 2 ) oral soft tissue safety ozone system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Healozone Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Use Ozone Management Dental Caries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study design twelve-month , multi-center , double-blind , randomize control clinical study involve 394 subject 788 lesion . There three site participate trial : Indiana University School Dentistry ( lead site ) , Tufts University School Dental Medicine , SUNY School Dental Medicine . Each site submit version protocol respective Institutional Review Board ( `` IRB '' ) incorporate specific institutional state guideline regulation applicable site . The two treatment regimen : ( ) placebo treatment ( b ) experimental ozone treatment . Selected subject least two teeth similar stage early active fissure caries . The selection study teeth determine review visual examination , include ICDAS severity score caries lesion activity score , conduct screen visit , conjunction bitewing radiograph . The decision whether tooth treat ozone receive placebo treatment make randomly . All clinical personnel involve clinical examination treatment application train primary site prior initiation trial use device , identify sign symptoms ozone toxicity provide appropriate medical response sign symptom observe . All qualified subject receive follow : 1 . Professional dental clean scale Screening Visit ( separate visit prior baseline visit complete study 12 month . 2 . Diagnostic procedure : 1 . Clinical visual examination ( utilizing International Caries Detection Assessment System [ ICDAS ] severity score ) 2 . Clinical visual/tactile assessment caries lesion activity 3 . Bitewing x-rays 4 . Laser fluorescence measurement ( utilizing DIAGNOdent , KaVo ) 3 . Treatment Regimen : Using split-mouth design , assign investigational treatment regimen administer two select study teeth baseline , three- , six- nine-month appointment . After three , six , nine twelve month , diagnostic procedure repeat exception bitewing x-ray , repeat twelve-month exam ( unless examine dentist determine x-ray also need six- nine-month visit confirm whether dentinal caries present ) . In addition , optional digital photograph take Boston site select study teeth document clinical change study period . If select study tooth progress initial caries lesion advance lesion , judgment examine dentist require restorative intervention , tooth restore cost subject lesion record 'progression baseline ' remain examination . The subject eligible remain study . Subjects receive thorough dental cleaning scale topical fluoride treatment conclusion twelve-month examination . The primary efficacy parameter ICDAS severity value . The severity criterion use ICDAS diagnostic system follow : 0 = Sound tooth surface . 1 . = First visual change enamel . 2 . = Distinct visual change enamel . 3 . = Localized enamel breakdown due caries visible dentin . 4 . = Underlying dark shadow dentin , without localize enamel breakdown . 5 . = Distinct cavity visible dentin . 6 . = Extensive distinct cavity visible dentin . The secondary efficacy parameter measure : Caries Lesion Activity score : 1 . = Inactive - surface enamel appear whitish , brownish black . Enamel may shiny feel hard smooth tip probe move gently across surface . 2 . = Active lesion - surface enamel appear whitish/yellowish opaque loss luster . The surface feel rough tip probe move gently across surface . Radiographic Changes : The occlusal surface study teeth evaluate use follow scale : Lesion presence : yes /no Lesion depth : E1 = outer half enamel E2 = inner half enamel D1 = outer third dentin D2 = middle third dentin D3 = inner third dentin greater/pulpal exposure Laser fluorescence measurement : DIAGNOdent read use scale 00 99 , 00 indicate caries activity 99 indicating high level activity .</detailed_description>
