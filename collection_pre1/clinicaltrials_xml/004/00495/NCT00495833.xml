	<detailed_description>Hypertension , leave untreated , major risk factor stroke , heart attack , heart failure kidney failure . Many people hypertension n't know disease and/or may treat . As high risk health complication manage condition . People see regular healthcare provider likely know hypertension , likely receive appropriate treatment . However , many patient call 9-1-1 emergency medical service ( EMS ) regular health care provider may risk undiagnosed treated disease . EMS personnel enter home thousand resident year . Emergency medical technician ( EMTs ) routinely take patient ' blood pressure part standard diagnostic procedure . EMTs paramedic complete medical incident report form ( MIRF ) patient , include information . As recorded MIRFs , thousand patient high blood pressure ( define systolic measurement 160 high and/or diastolic measurement 100 high ) visit . Blood pressure may elevate simply stress anxiety 9-1-1 response . But even light potential `` white coat '' phenomenon , blood pressure reading level high cause concern , especially case patient transported hospital examination . From February - April , 2007 collect baseline data patient high blood pressure reading ( 160/100 high ) 9-1-1 response EMT ( SPHERE Hypertension Baseline Data Study ) . We want understand patient remember 9-1-1 response around high blood pressure measure , patient seek second reading , patient seek follow-up care result high blood pressure measure . We also interest learn patient trust EMTs provider preventive health care . This baseline data also allow u accurately measure success propose intervention study . The baseline data collection almost complete proceed intervention study . We propose conduct intervention study next , aim : - Motivating subject receive follow-up hypertension assessment EMT local fire station receive high blood pressure read EMT 911 event . - Motivating subject monitor blood pressure appropriate .</detailed_description>
