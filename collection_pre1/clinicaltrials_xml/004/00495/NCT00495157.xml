	<brief_summary>Asthma effectively control use inhale corticosteroid medication . Treatment inhaled corticosteroid often require periodic adjustment medication dose frequency level . This study examine whether beneficial adjust corticosteroid treatment base asthma symptom and/or biomarkers lung function versus standard medical guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma Clinical Research Network ( ACRN ) Trial - Best Adjustment Strategy Asthma Long Term ( BASALT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma common , long-term disease cause inflammation airway . Symptoms asthma may include wheezing , cough , shortness breath , chest tightness . The common treatment asthma use inhale corticosteroid medication periodic adjustment treatment intensity . For example , corticosteroid dosage increase asthma symptom worsen decrease symptom improve . However , guideline make adjustment , especially reduced intensity adjustment , well establish . In people initially well controlled daily low-dose inhale corticosteroid therapy , symptom-based adjustment ( SBA ) and/or biomarker-based adjustment ( BBA ) inhale corticosteroid therapy may beneficial maintain asthma control standard , guideline-based adjustment ( GBA ) . The purpose study determine adjust treatment base symptom and/or lung function biomarkers effective control asthma adjust corticosteroid use base standardized medical guideline . This study begin 4-week period participant monitor use inhaler contain low dose inhale corticosteroid medication . Participants assign take part either BASALT study Tiotropium Alternative Long-Acting Beta-Agonists Corticosteroids ( TALC ) study , separate Asthma Clinical Research Network ( ACRN ) study . Participants BASALT undergo 2 4 week adherence testing , involve use three inhaler electronic monitoring device attach . Participants also ask measure record breathing rate lung function study diary . BASALT participant randomly assign one three treatment group : SBA , BBA , GBA . Each participant give four inhaler : one inhaler contain albuterol , use as-needed basis rescue medication ; one inhaler contain corticosteroid medication ; two inhaler contain placebo . One latter three inhaler use time albuterol inhaler use , two inhaler use daily basis . Study visit occur Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 treatment period . Inhalers adjust visit base SBA , BBA , GBA guideline . At select visit , follow procedure occur : physical exam ; blood collection ; allergy skin testing ; heart rate monitoring ; lung function airway test ; methacholine challenge test determine asthma severity ; questionnaires assess asthma control , quality life , healthcare factor . Participants record asthma symptom , peak flow measurement , medication usage daily diary .</detailed_description>
