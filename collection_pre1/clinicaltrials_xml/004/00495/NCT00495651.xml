	<brief_summary>The Temprano trial base follow assumption : - ART initiation CD4 count &lt; 800/mm3 could significantly reduce probability severe HIV-related morbidity death medium term . - Tuberculosis tuberculosis-related death likely represent considerable proportion morbidity mortality among HIV-infected patient high CD4 count sub-Saharan Africa . Therefore , 6-month Isoniazide Prophylaxis Tuberculosis ( IPT ) early ART could enhance others efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Antiretroviral Treatment and/or Early Isoniazid Prophylaxis Against Tuberculosis HIV-infected Adults ( ANRS 12136 TEMPRANO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The main individual benefit early ART initiation likely reduction early severe AIDS-defining non-AIDS-defining morbidity . While disease might justify early initiation high-income country generally non-infectious ( non-AIDS-defining malignancy , renal disease cardiovascular disease ) , lead cause early severe AIDS-defining morbidity sub-Saharan Africa tuberculosis main cause severe non-AIDS-defining morbidity non-invasive bacterial disease . As result poor access diagnosis care , HIV-infected people die early infectious disease reach current WHO criteria start ART . - Although Côte d'Ivoire National Tuberculosis Program ( PNLT ) authorize use prophylaxis tuberculosis , allow Temprano trial provide six-month course isoniazid ( INH ) prophylaxis half study subject . This allow u ( ) put early ART perspective early 6-month INH prophylaxis use , set tuberculosis first cause severe HIV-associated morbidity ; ( ii ) describe assess feasibility six-month course INH prophylaxis among patient high CD4 count . - Some drug toxicity immediate reversible . If early ART compare ART short term , toxicity may demonstrate erroneously early ART unfavorable . The risk benefit early ART initiation therefore evaluate long term . In Temprano trial , : ( ) follow patient least 30 month analyze primary outcome 30 month ; ( ii ) follow study subject 80 month evaluate evolution ART efficacy / toxicity ratio month 30 month 80 secondary endpoint , inform future policy early ART find beneficial 30 month . Main objective : To assess benefit risk start ART immediately and/or receive 6-month IPT among HIV-infected adult CD4 count &lt; 800mm3 criterion start ART immediately accord recent WHO guideline . Location : Abidjan , Côte d'Ivoire . Methods : randomize 2x2 factorial superiority trial Main inclusion criterion : ( ) HIV-1 HIV-1+2 infection ; ( ii ) age &gt; 18 year ; ( iii ) nadir CD4 count &lt; 800/mm3 criterion start ART immediately accord recent WHO guideline ; ( iv ) active tuberculosis . Trial arm : Arm I : ART initiation accord WHO criterion , time follow-up ; Arm II : INH prophylaxis ( 300 mg/day ) six month ART initiation accord WHO criterion , time follow-up ; Arm III : immediate ART initiation , reach WHO criteria ; Arm IV : INH prophylaxis ( 300 mg/day ) six month immediate ART initiation , reach WHO criterion . First-line ART regimens - Tenofovir / emtricitabine + efavirenz HIV-1-infected men HIV-1-infected woman meet following requirement : effective contraception history nevirapine use prevention mother-to-child transmission HIV ( PMTCT ) . - Tenofovir / emtricitabine + lopinavir / ritonavir HIV-1+2-infected patient woman use effective contraception history nevirapine use PMTCT . Primary endpoint : Death ( all-cause ) , AIDS-defining disease , non-AIDS-defining malignancy , non-AIDS-defining invasive bacterial disease . Main secondary endpoint : Grade 3 4 clinical event ( include renal cardiovascular event ) laboratory test result , define ANRS classification system drug-related adverse event . Final primary analysis : It perform last patient reach 30 month follow-up . Time-dependent analysis compare primary outcome : ( ) among patient initiate ART immediately ( arm III IV ) versus patient initiate ART accord WHO criterion ( arm I II ) ; ( ii ) among patient prescribe 6-months ( arm II IV ) IPT versus ( arm I III ) . Intermediate analysis safety criterion : - Toxicity : all-cause mortality . We plan perform intermediate analysis criterion . If number observe death higher anticipate , however , DSMB may decide carry one . In case , adjust alpha coefficient use method suggest Pocock account large variety available test . - Efficacy : incidence severe morbidity . Intermediate analysis : We plan intermediate analysis criterion . If number severe morbidity even high anticipated patient reach 12 month follow-up , DSMB may decide carry one . In case , adjust alpha coefficient use method suggest Haybittle-Peto , account large variety available test .</detailed_description>
