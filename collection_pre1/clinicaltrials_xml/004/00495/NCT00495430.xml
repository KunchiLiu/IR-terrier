	<detailed_description>Computerized analysis show normal lung sound distinctive characteristic differentiate abnormal lung sounds.However , technical issue complicate display mode restrict use computerized lung sound analyse clinical environment . The VRI provide dynamic gray-scale image quantitative lung data show breath sound distribution healthy individual . Typical feature discern trained raters quantitative lung data may serve reference comparison abnormal breath sound image .</detailed_description>
