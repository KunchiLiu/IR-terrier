	<brief_summary>This 3-center , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled study 16-week treatment phase determine whether subcutaneous omalizumab , compare placebo , reduces degree bronchoconstriction induce environmental cat dander exposure patient 18-65 year old stable , moderate asthma history cat dander-induced asthma symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Omalizumab Preventing Bronchoconstriction Following Environmental Cat Dander Exposure Patients With Cat Dander-induced Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cat dander allergen challenge model use collect data Outcome Measures . The cat allergen level model similar find home cat capable induce lower- upper-airway response use assess efficacy several asthma allergy therapy . Cat allergen exposure perform room furnish upholstered furniture , blanket , cat litter box . The door keep closed time , except personnel study patient enter leave room . The ventilation system operate time except cat allergen challenge . Two neutered adult cat keep room time free move except challenge , time place wire cage . Immediately challenge , blanket shake vigorously distribute cat allergen throughout room .</detailed_description>
