	<brief_summary>Title : Impact daily zinc supplementation infant bear low birth weight mortality severe disease require hospitalization Background : Zinc supplementation show prevent diarrhea pneumonia 6 month 3 year old child . Little known impact zinc supplementation low birth weight ( LBW ) baby first 6 month life . Objective : The objective determine impact daily zinc administration 1RDA ( 5 mg ) elemental zinc LBW infant severe morbidity require hospitalization cause mortality . Design : In double blind randomize placebo control trial 2012 hospital-born infant birth weight &lt; 2500 g randomly assign receive zinc placebo 6 month . Zinc group receive 5 mg elemental zinc acetate daily 4 week age . Cause specific hospitalization death , episode diarrhea , acute respiratory infection , illness , visit health care provider hospital OPDs ascertain in-depth interview document like prescription , hospital ticket , medicine carton 3 6 month age . Results : Number infants one diarrhea episodes less 17 % ( 95 % CI : 1 % 35 % ) zinc group number ARI similar two group . The hospitalization rate due cause diarrhea ARI similar two group . Twelve zinc group 9 placebo group die 4 week 6 month ( p=0.36 ) . We observe significant difference gain weight length 3 month 6 month group . In subgroup infant mean serum zinc concentration zinc group 27 % high ( p=0.004 ) placebo group . Conclusion : Hospital born , low birth weight infant seem derive worthwhile benefit daily zinc supplementation recommend dietary allowance zinc term morbidity growth first six month life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : i.To determine impact daily administration 1 RDA ( 5 mg ) elemental zinc LBW infants 4 week 6 month life all-cause mortality . ii.To determine impact zinc supplementation severe morbidity require hospitalization . Rationale : i.The prevalence LBW high Asia , particularly South Asian country like India , Pakistan Bangladesh . LBW infant high neonatal infant mortality morbidity rate . ii.A recent preliminary study show zinc supplementation LBW infant reduce mortality ( Sazawal et al. , 2001 ) . iii.A target intervention LBW infant start 4 week age programmatically highly attractive . It combined immunization program recent recommendation give iron folate infant . iv.The fact mortality rate high LBW infant mean relatively small study give u result suitable policy decision . Study population location : The infant recruit birth maternity ward M.R . Bangur General Hospital 6000 delivery take place year . Located Kolkata hospital serf district West Bengal . Preliminary data collect u four hospital West Bengal show little 37 % baby bear birth weight less 2500 g. Taking conservative estimate 35 % baby bear LBW ( &lt; 2500 g ) , 2000 LBW baby expect born hospital year . LBW infant born hospital recruit study follow home . Mainly urban peri-urban poor use Government hospital . The hospital service render free charge Government . Sample size : One preliminary zinc supplementation trial small-for-date infant report high 67 % reduction mortality rate zinc supplementation 2 9 month age . We consider effect highly optimistic . Therefore , calculate require sample size base conservative estimate various level expect reduction mortality rate associate zinc supplementation LBW infant . Taking figure infant mortality rate 40/100 LBW infant assume least 50 % death occur 4 week 6 month age . We expect 20 death per 100 infant observation period study . Assuming reduction mortality rate 35 % 95 % confidence 80 % power , need total sample size 970 infant , include 10 % excess account deviate course ( e.g . Loss follow-up , withdrawal consent ) . Assuming mortality rate reduction 30 % similar assumption total ( plus 10 % deviated course ) sample size 1360 LBW infant . If expect reduction mortality rate 25 % , total sample size would 1900 infant include 10 % deviated course . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Weight birth less 2500 g 2 . Infant likely stay city next 6 month 3 . Absence gross congenital malformation Exclusion criterion : 1 . Perinatal illness require hospital stay birth 7 day 2 . Written inform consent provide parent 3 . Presence gross congenital anomaly 4 . Resides distance make difficult reach home visit ( estimate time reach 3 hour ) Randomization blinding : The inclusion criterion ascertain eligible consider inclusion study . The child visit clinic home visit make 3-4 week team health worker still alive infant randomly assign zinc placebo group . A master randomization code prepare use permuted block random number use block length 4 , 6 8 . This code hold person involve study number bottle contain formulation placebo child accord randomization chart bottle label serial number child study . The final code keep person involve study . The zinc syrup placebo similar appearance , consistency taste . Intervention : Each infant study receive placebo 5 mg elemental zinc ( 1 RDA ) zinc acetate syrup daily 4 week age . For routine immunization care , parent advise attend baby clinic hospital another hospital locality . In case report detected illness field worker , free drug provide hospitalization facilitate require . Enrollment subject : We estimate 80 % LBW baby realistically include study . We earlier estimate approximately little 2000 LBW baby bear year hospital . We recruit total 2012 infant , 1005 zinc group 1007 placebo group . After obtain informed verbal consent , infant eligible enrollment maternity ward escort home health worker note exact location stay . The mother advise bring infant hospital 4 week baseline information infant record 8 week ' supply zinc/placebo formulation provide parent instruction use . The mother , supervision , give first dose clinic . If mother return 4 week birth , field worker visit home medicine provide . The field worker visit home 8 week later record event infant provide another 8 week medicine . After 16 week medication , infant visit clinic field visit make ascertain state infant provide 8 week medication evaluation record , 8 week . Measurement study outcome : Death record contact . The cause death ascertain verbal autopsy . Available hospital record examine team pediatrician independently review verbal autopsy questionnaire . The diagnosis make consensus discussion . Similarly , illness event require hospitalization document contact . A questionnaire use hospital record examine , include prescription . At contact either clinic home , detail illness event treatment receive recorded standardize data form documentation prescription , medicine bottle carton physically check record . Anthropometric measurement record 3 6 month receive medicine . All documentation morbidity evaluate fortnightly meeting health worker two pediatrician involve study ( DM &amp; AS ) cause 's hospital admission , death morbidity review diagnosis make &amp; record Ethical consideration : Written inform consent obtain parent . Ethics Review Committee Society Applied Studies , Kolkata approve protocol . Data management statistical analysis : The data enter desktop computer edit use software EPI Info ( CDC , Atlanta , USA WHO , Geneva ) analyze EPI Info another software name Stata ( Stata Corporation , Texas , USA ) . The main comparison receive zinc receive placebo . Baseline information compare evaluate comparability two group . These include socio-economic variable , type delivery , gestation , birth weight , breast-feeding status etc . The two group compare all-cause mortality . The proportion infant illness require hospitalization two group compare . For comparison , first episode require hospitalization particular infant consider . Although follow-up period would similar , degree variable follow-up expect addressed use person-time calculation 4 week end study . The analysis base intention-to-treat . Results : About 20,248 neonate evaluate eligibility maternity ward MR Bangur Hospital 5,942 &lt; 2,500g weight . A total 2,012 infant admit study , 1,005 zinc group 1,007 placebo group . A total 909 infant zinc group 913 placebo group complete 6 month follow-up . The birth weight , type delivery , birth order mother education comparable two group . Weight , length , head midarm circumference 3 6 month similar two group . In subgroup infant ' blood hemoglobin level determine completion study mean value two group similar . In subgroup infant zinc supplement group substantially high mean zinc concentration compare placebo . The number deaths two group significantly different . Hospitalization rate diarrhea , ARI cause similar two group . The number infants one episodes diarrhea significantly less among zinc supplement group ( 17 % , 95 % CI:1 35 % ) . The number infants one episodes acute respiratory infection similar two group ( p=0.76 ) .</detailed_description>
