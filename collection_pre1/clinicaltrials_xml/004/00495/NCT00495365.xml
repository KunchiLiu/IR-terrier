	<brief_title>A Dose Conversion Study Epoetin Alfa Subjects With Anemia Chronic Kidney Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter study subject chronic kidney disease . The study design address hemoglobin stability drug conversion epoetin alfa subject previously receive darbepoetin alfa therapy . The study enroll approximately 180 subject chronic kidney disease . Eligible subject chronic kidney disease receive darbepoetin alfa every two , three , four week period 3 month stable hemoglobin ( Hb ) level study entry 12 g/dL ( plus minus 1 g/dL ( 11-13 g/dL ) . Subjects receive darbepoetin alfa every 2 , 3 4 week switch epoetin alfa receive dosing frequency ( every 2 , 3 4 week ) upon study entry throughout 24 week study period . Clinical safety assess occurrence severity adverse event . Blood test ( Complete Blood Count , platelet , reticulocyte count , iron , assess pre-determined interval throughout study . Vital sign ( e.g . Blood pressure ) check visit . Subjects receive epoetin alfa dose frequency previously receive darbepoetin alfa . Subjects received 20,000 Units ( U ) epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) every two week ; 30,000 U epoetin alfa SC every 3 week ; 40,000 U epoetin alfa SC every 4 week .</detailed_description>
