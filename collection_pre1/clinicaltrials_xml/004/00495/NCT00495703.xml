	<brief_summary>Cognitive dysfunction follow chemotherapy adverse treatment effect impact quality life many cancer survivor receive adjuvant therapy . A strong body evidence indicate initiation regular exercise program , level readily achievable adult ( 3-5 d/wk , 30-45 min/session ) , improve cognitive function . Importantly , domain cognitive function enhance exercise participation domains negatively affected chemotherapy . Accordingly , propose 2 year research program seek develop test safe , simple , effective exercise intervention optimize cognitive function follow chemotherapy . To begin research , : 1 ) conduct randomize exercise intervention trial among cancer survivor report persistent cognitive problem follow chemotherapy ( n=60 ) , 2 ) explore possible mediator moderator intervention cognition order begin understand intervention may work may effective , 3 ) , conduct cross-sectional study compare cancer survivor enrol trial ( n=60 ) match control ( n=40 ) evaluate cognitive status among survivor intervention . We hypothesize six-months regular exercise enhance cognitive function among cancer survivor , cancer survivor report cognitive dysfunction lower objectively measured cognitive performance adult receive chemotherapy . To knowledge study would first examine influence regular exercise participation cognitive function among cancer survivor experience cognitive difficulty follow chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A substantial number cancer survivor receive chemotherapy report mild moderate cognitive impairment follow treatment . These impairment report across range cancer type chemotherapy agent . Adjuvant treatment report affect multiple cognitive domain , three domain appear strongly affect ( i.e. , executive functioning , declarative memory , motor function ) . Exercise participation , level readily achievable adult ( 3-5 d/wk , 30-45 min/d ) , preserve enhances cognitive function . Importantly , domain enhance exercise overlap substantially domains adversely affected chemotherapy . Accordingly , propose 2 year research program seek develop test safe , simple , effective exercise intervention optimize cognitive function follow chemotherapy . To begin research , : 1 ) conduct randomize exercise intervention trial among cancer survivor report persistent cognitive problem follow chemotherapy ( exercise , n=30 vs. standard care , n=30 ) ; 2 ) explore possible mediator moderator intervention effect cognition ; 3 ) , conduct cross-sectional study compare cancer survivor enrol trial ( n=60 ) match control ( n=40 ) evaluate cognitive status among survivor intervention . We employ proven home-based exercise intervention state art cognitive testing relevant cognitive domain ( e.g. , Randt Memory Test , Trail Making B , Stroop task , T ask switch , Response compatibility ) use preliminary study . We hypothesize six-months regular exercise enhance cognitive function among cancer survivor , cancer survivor report cognitive dysfunction lower objectively measured cognitive performance adult receive chemotherapy . To knowledge study would first examine influence regular exercise participation cognitive function among cancer survivor experience cognitive difficulty follow chemotherapy . Completion project provide research team necessary experience intervention effectiveness information use conduct future definitive trial .</detailed_description>
