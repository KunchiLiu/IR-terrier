	<brief_title>Tolerability Safety Subcutaneous Administration Affitope AD01 Mild Moderate Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) devastate neurodegenerative disorder cure . Although etiology AD fully understood , recent research suggest Aβ central disease process . Consequently , approach capable remove Aβ brain , Aβ immunotherapy , expect possess disease-modifying potential . This view support evidence gather mouse model AD study involve AD patient . Based view active Aβ immunotherapy disease-modifying potential animal model AD patient , knowledge gather side-effects Aβ-based immunotherapy encounter human , design new generation AD vaccine . Rather use full length Aβ , choose use mimotopes N-terminal end Aβ antigenic component vaccine ( Mimotopes discover Affiris GmbH term Affitopes ) . Mimotopes peptides functionally mimic native antigenic epitope show sequence identity . Thus , different original antigen , mimotopes recognize antibody , vice versa , capable induce antibody cross-react original antigen . A major advantage offer mimotopes lack tolerance mechanism would prevent induction immune response ( case self peptides/proteins Aβ ) . To increase vaccine 's safety profile , length mimotope use limited preclude elicitation Aβ-specific T cell . Also , mimotope use design generate antibody direct exclusively Aβ ( i.e. , recognize parental APP ) . To provide helper epitope generation antibody response , mimotope couple carrier . The trial design patient-blinded , single-center , randomize , control , parallel group , phase I clinical study repeat every 4 week administration subcutaneous injection Affitope AD01 alone adsorb aluminum hydroxide 24 patient mild moderate Alzheimer 's Disease . In total , patient receive 4 immunization . Patients randomize receive Affitope AD01 alone adsorb aluminum hydroxide . Each treatment group consist 12 patient . For safety reason , inclusion patient do stepwise manner .</detailed_description>
