	<brief_summary>The burden cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) considerable , despite many advance diagnosis , clinical management drug therapy . The World Health Organization estimate 30 % global death attributable CVD whilst mortality rate develop country fall , remain large single cause death ( WHO , 2007 ) . Nineteen every 100 death Australia attribute CVD , annual cost $ 1.47 billion ( AIHW , 2006 ) . Assessing risk future cardiovascular event traditionally base number 'risk-factors ' determine observational clinical study Framingham cohort . Recent evidence however invalidate use high low risk group raise question apply method change risk-behaviour . A considerable number new risk marker surface recent year ( include various biomarkers , pulse wave velocity measure arterial function ) . Unfortunately long-term predictive capacity largely unknown , particularly compare exist risk factor . The aim study provide objective longitudinal data wide variety risk marker current use development . Participants current on-going clinical study approach lengthen observation period purpose determine long-term clinical outcome . Standard clinical observation data obtain within participant 's enrolled study collate electronic database . All exist future study must individual approval appropriate ethic committee sign consent . The baseline study follow-up assessment cohort correlate cardiovascular event , hospitalization mortality . In addition , volunteer direct appropriate clinical study CVD , thereby enhance recruitment , encourage good quality clinical study advance knowledge cardiovascular disease prevention .</brief_summary>
