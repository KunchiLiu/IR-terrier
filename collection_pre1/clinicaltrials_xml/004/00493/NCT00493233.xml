	<detailed_description>There evidence use one antipsychotic drug enhances clinical efficacy . Nonetheless , practice highly prevalent ( 1/3 patient population ) , physicians reluctant reduce patient ' treatment single antipsychotic drug fear precipitate relapse . This study therefore seek evaluate effectiveness continue treatment one antipsychotic drug use rigorous placebo-controlled design . The result study subsequently serve guide physician make appropriately inform decision regard continuation multiple antipsychotic drug . Our primary hypothesis expect find difference primary variable interest ( BPRS ) follow reduction antipsychotic monotherapy ( placebo group ) versus continue antipsychotic polypharmacy . This propose study first study systematically address reduction antipsychotic polypharmacy monotherapy patient primary psychotic disorder prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled design . The result study important implication clinical practice physician treat severely mentally ill often constrain practice beyond limit available clinical guideline evidence base medicine . Thus , light high grow prevalence practice , propose study speak real practical clinical dilemma within field . Furthermore , university-based , tertiary care psychiatric centre serve thousand severely ill patient suffer primary psychotic disorder establish track record innovative clinical research , uniquely place address critical question . Male female subject age ≥ 18 year suffer primary psychotic disorder treat two antipsychotic drug least 30 day ( exclude `` prn '' `` need '' antipsychotic prescription ) eligible participate study . Subjects history treatment depot antipsychotic within 6-months enrollment exclude form study unless depot antipsychotic consider `` main '' antipsychotic drug study . The `` main '' antipsychotic drug determine treat physician , except case clozapine consider 'main ' antipsychotic . Eligible subject randomly allocate two group : Group 1 continue take concomitant antipsychotic drug ; Group 2 allocate placebo place concomitant antipsychotic drug .
