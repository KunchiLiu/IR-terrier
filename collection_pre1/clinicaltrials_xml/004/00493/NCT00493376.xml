	<brief_title>Study Tumour Response Tirapazamine During Treatment Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients locally advanced cervical cancer poor clinical outcome standard cisplatin pelvic radiation therapy . It well establish pre-treatment tumor hypoxia significant prognostic factor tumor may one important modifiable mechanism radiation resistance group tumours . Significant level hypoxia present locally advanced cervical tumor . Hence measurement pretreatment tumour oxygenation status imperative , assess use various mean . Immunohistochemical stain various intrinsic hypoxia marker include Ca9 , Glut1 , HIF-1 alpha pre-treatment tumour perform . Tirapazamine , bio-reductively activated hypoxic cell selective anti-tumour agent , find act synergistically cisplatinum , result significantly high cell kill expect base additive action . We propose measure cell kill effect tirapazamine follow test : - Comet assay : Tirapazamine cause DNA damage predict cell kill measure DNA damage cell tumor biopsy use alkaline comet assay . - Measurement phosphorylation histone gamma H2AX : It explore measure radiosensitivity response clinically relevant dos radiation . The histone gamma H2AX phosphorylation use detect tirapazamine induce DNA double-strand break collapse replication fork . There evidence drug delivery may impair fact drug may actually reach hypoxic tumour cell . A recent study show , experimental setting , tirapazamine cause decrease vascular perfusion measure contrast enhance MRI . We propose assess mechanism operative human tumour . Clinical study demonstrate tumour vascular increase course radiation therapy , consistent re-oxygenation suggestive good outcome . Tumours become less hypoxic course therapy increase likelihood response give treatment . However , response tirapazamine may reduce . In order ass vascular change may occur directly tirapazamine infusion , well increase tumour vascularity perhaps increase tumour oxygenation course therapy , plan assess tumours course therapy . Assessment tumour perfusion vessel permeability 10 radiation treatment ( day 12 ) chemo-radiation therapy perform via T1 weight dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCMRI ) . We hypothesize : 1 . Tirapazamine ( hypoxic cell cytotoxin radiosensitizer ) result increase DNA damage well clinical outcome : 1. pre-treatment tumor demonstrate significant hypoxia 2. tirapazamine treatment result increase DNA damage 2. tirapazamine act , part , change vascular perfusion tumour change measure dynamic contrast enhance MRI .</detailed_description>
