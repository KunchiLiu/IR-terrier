	<brief_summary>Low blood sugar night ( call nocturnal hypoglycemia ) , often happen without symptom last long time . Doctors often suggest patient take bedtime snack try prevent low blood sugar night happen , know type snack best take . We conduct study evaluate two different type snack affect often blood sugar low overnight . One snack primarily carbohydrate snack carbohydrate snack fat . The snack provide study . As part study , continuous glucose sensor ( Freestyle Navigator ) wear overnight . The Freestyle Navigator develop Abbott Diabetes Care . This sensor use glucose oxidase base electrochemical sensor , design measure blood glucose level range 20-500 mg/dl . The sensor insert subcutaneously measure interstitial glucose . In human study interstitial glucose level generally lag behind blood glucose 3 to13 minute . ( 27 , 28 ) The Freestyle Navigator , provide glucose read every 60 second ( 1440 reading day ) . Each sensor design provide reading 120 hour . It alarm hypoglycemia hyperglycemia project high low glucose value . The alarm set point adjust user . The Navigator also trend arrow indicate glucose rate change ( &gt; -2 mg/dL/min , -2 -1 mg/dL/min , -1 1 mg/dL/min , 1 2 mg/dl/min , &gt; 2 mg/dl/min ) . Subjects enter event , take insulin , ate , exercise . The sensor require calibration value enter 3 time first day wear , 2 additional time 5-day wear period . The value enter directly Navigator Freestyle home glucose meter build unit . The Navigator yet approve FDA . The Navigator currently review FDA limit sensor wear 3 day . This study do see difference low blood sugar overnight bedtime snack make carbohydrate compare carbohydrate snack fat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There 100 child study . The child take part five center United States . When child enters study , follow do : 1 . The parent child ask child 's diabetes management include child 's overnight basal rate , correction dos , bolus dos cover bedtime snack whether change depend active child 's day . 2 . The parent child taught use Navigator . The first sensor insert parent child guidance study nurse . The child wear sensor 5 day . The parent child able see result sensor . 3 . The parent child instruct test child 's blood sugar least 4 time day ( meal bedtime ) use Freestyle home glucose meter build Navigator . Additional test do need calibrate Navigator . 4 . The parent child give instruction use study website complete questionnaire night child 's bedtime blood sugar read active child 's day . 5 . The parent child return clinic visit 4 30 day later . The Navigator connect computer questionnaire parent/child complete DirecNet website review . If child able wear Navigator , complete blood sugar testing , complete questionnaire night DirecNet website , child continue study . 1 . The child ask wear 3 sensor get least 12 night reading three week period . 2 . The parent child taught use accelerometer . This device measure amount movement child . It 1.75 inch long 1.75 inch wide strap skin either around waist , wrist ankle . 3 . The parent child give instruction use study website complete questionnaire obtain type bedtime snack . The amount snack insulin dose cover bedtime snack base child 's usual diabetes management . On six night child ask eat primarily carbohydrate snack six night , child ask eat carbohydrate plus fat snack . The order snack choose random computer . If drink need , child ask drink water bedtime snack . 4 . The child ask follow return clinic visit 3 week later : - Check blood sugar least 4 time day use Freestyle home glucose meter build Navigator need calibrate device . - Wear three Navigator sensor get total least 12 night blood sugar reading - Enter meal marker event Navigator time child meal snack - Enter exercise marker event Navigator time child exercise - Wear accelerometer time ( day night ) Navigator worn - Complete short questionnaire study website 12 night Navigator accelerometer worn find type bedtime snack . Follow-up Visit After use Navigator home 12 night , child return clinic follow-up visit . 1 . The Navigator accelerometer connect computer data save . - If child least 12 night least 5 hour Navigator data monitor complete website questionnaire , give another sensor additional snack ask come back another week . 2 . Once child least 12 night least 5 hour Navigator data complete website questionnaire , information device review parent child .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes use daily insulin therapy least one year ( The diagnosis type 1 diabetes base investigator 's judgment ; C peptide level antibody determination need . ) Age 8.0 year less 18.0 year HbA1c &lt; 10.0 % ( The DCA2000 use assess eligibility . ) Stable insulin regimen least 1 month anticipate change prior subject 's completion study ( Stable define change overall insulin program , i.e. , change SC injection pump Lantus therapy , Lantus therapy pump . ) Insulin regimen involve either use insulin pump Lantus ( shortacting insulin ) NPH Lente , part insulin regimen , give morning breakfast Subject willing bedtime snack night routinely snack least 4 7 night part his/her normal diabetes management Subject home computer internet access For female , subject intend become pregnant next month No expectation subject move area clinical center next month The presence significant medical disorder judgment investigator affect wear sensor completion aspect protocol . Known Celiac disease medical disorder ( include lactose intolerance food allergy peanut ) would prevent subject consume bedtime snack The presence follow disease : Asthma treat systemic inhaled corticosteroid last 6 month Cystic fibrosis Other major illness judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol ( Adequately treat thyroid disease exclude subject enrollment ) Current use oral/inhaled glucocorticoid medication , judgment investigator would contraindication participation study .</criteria>
