	<brief_title>Evaluating Impact GP Practice Nurse Training Self Regulations Skills Patient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve train GPs nurse recognize patient differ term asthma characteristic , symptom trigger , well personal attribute lifestyle . The programme teach professional work patient improve asthma management ; involve help people asthma observe action , learn , support self-help behaviour , integrate daily routine .

UK ( http : //www.sign.ac.uk/ ) evidence-based guideline recommend help asthma control symptom improve quality life provision education individualise , write action plan . Our aim carry prospective , cluster randomise trial general practice Aberdeen Glasgow , Scotland , assess impact educational intervention target training practice nurse general practitioner ( GPs ) patient-centred asthma care ; specifically help patient develop asthma self regulation skill . The intervention modify programme successfully implemented American office base paediatrician , find effective US paediatric asthma population term clinical outcome parent satisfaction ( 1 ) . The hypothesis patient see doctor nurse primary care train develop patient self regulation skill well asthma-related quality life , control clinical outcome , satisfy clinical consultation , control group patient attend doctor nurse receive training . One nominate GP one nominate practice nurse eight intervention practice receive train modify Clark-Evans programme asthma training . GPs practice nurse nominate eight control practice deliver care usual study . Patients target recruitment present symptom sign relate poorly control asthma nominate GPs Practice nurse . Questionnaire data collect baseline cohort , 20 datasets per practice ( 16 ) accrue ( 320 total ) . Questionnaire data collect 20 patient per practice presenting circumstance nominate GPs Practice nurse intervention practice ( 160 total ) . Questionnaire data also collect 20 patient per practice presenting circumstance nominate GPs Practice nurse control practice , deliver care usual ( 160 total ) . The post training cohort ( control intervention ) follow questionnaires 3 12 month index consultation . Routinely available data collect patient evidence poorly control asthma training . A total 320 patient ( 160 arm ) total 16 practice ( ie . 20 patient per practice ) ensure 90 % power baseline post-intervention cohort 5 % significance level ( randomisation practice sample size calculation inflate correct intracluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) ) . The primary outcome measure Mini AQLQ ( 2 ) Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale ( MISS-21 ) ( 3 ) . Secondary measure : Patients ' Perception Involvement Questionnaire ( 4 ) , Asthma Control Questionnaire , ( ACQ ) ( 5 ) .
