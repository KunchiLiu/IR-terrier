	<brief_title>X-3 Polyethylene Survival Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This fixed-bearing knee intend use patient undergo cemented total knee arthroplasty . The device use FDA approve via 510k clearance . A total 572 case ( 286 per group ) enter . Each patient assess pre-operatively post-operatively three month two , five , seven ten year . The primary endpoint revision rate ten year . The result analyze use unconditional test equivalence two independent binomial . Chi-square analysis use compare instance mortality , revision surgery , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , neurovascular complication , infection . Other outcome measure incorporate Knee Society Clinical rating scale undergo appropriate generalize linear regression type outcome involve . The primary aim study compare survivorship two type polyethylene ( conventional N2Vac highly cross-linked X3 ) use fixed-bearing total knee system patient undergo cemented total knee arthroplasty . These result measure radiographs post-operative interval independent radiograph review perform patient reach 7 10 year follow-up . Secondary result also collect focus disease-specific ( Knee Society Scores ) , global ( SF-12 v1 ) , outcome measure . Radiographic result consist stand anteroposterior , lateral Merchant view surgical knee record analyze . Completion initial investigation occur 10-year interval last enrol .</detailed_description>
