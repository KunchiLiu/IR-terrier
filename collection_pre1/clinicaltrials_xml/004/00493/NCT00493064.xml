	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Niacin , B vitamin , may act vasodilator encourage early formation collateral blood vessel may serve bypass obstruct vein eye . The topical steroid eye drop aim reduce swell retina , collateral vessel chance develop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Study Effectiveness Safety Niacin Topical Steroid Eye Drop Treat Retinal Vein Occlusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study develop less risky , yet effective sustainable treatment retinal vein occlusion current commonly use approach repeat intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide ( Kenalog ) injection . The type retinal vein occlusion study include central ( CRVO ) , hemi-retinal ( HRVO ) , branch ( BRVO ) retinal vein occlusion . Niacin , ( Nicotinic Acid , Nicotinamide ) B-vitamin , lipid lower vasodilating property . The combination Niacin Prednisolone Acetate steroid eye drop non-invasive treatment approach develop Principal Investigator . The Niacin dilate retinal vessel , hopefully encourage earlier collateral vessel formation aim bypass venous obstruction , thus restore venous outflow . The Prednisolone Acetate steroid eye drop aim reduce vascular leakage therefore macular edema eye Niacin take effect .</detailed_description>
