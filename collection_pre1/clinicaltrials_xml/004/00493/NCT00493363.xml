	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To assess level resistance artemisinin derivative Western Cambodia . Secondary objective : To assess level resistance antimalarial drug Western Cambodia 1 . Background ; There worry sign Western Cambodia parasitological response artesunate artemether contain treatment regimen uncomplicated falciparum malaria slow elsewhere world [ 1-4 ] . Both delayed parasite clearance unusually high failure rate artesunate-mefloquine artemether-lumefantrine report [ 1,2 ] . Although occasional poor response artesunate describe previously [ 5 ] current report suggest consistent problem . As rate parasite clearance good pharmacodynamic measure efficacy artemisinin related compound [ 6,7 ] , could indicate emergence significant resistance [ 8 ] . These antimalarial central current treatment strategy [ 9 ] , spread significant resistance outside area would disaster . Radical containment measure might need . In context urgent need proceed quickly investigate level resistance artemisinin derivative Western Cambodia provide definitive assessment necessary containment plan developed 2007 . A group malaria investigator Cambodia Thailand join together address urgent question quickly effectively possible . The trial describe proposes assess current recommend dos give normal way , necessary high dose artesunate . There know dose related toxicity artesunate , dose 10mg/kg/day give ( u ) without adverse effect [ 10 ] . The two feature study differ normal study uncomplicated malaria repeat blood sample 7 day in-patient stay . If response artesunate poor essential characterise blood concentration profile well parasitological response differentiate resistance abnormal pharmacokinetics . 2 . General Plan ; The situation review open forum malaria expert Cambodia , Thailand , WHO , consider sufficiently worry prompt plan urgent investigation aegis Mekong Malaria Programme . First necessary determine level in-vivo in-vitro susceptibility artemisinin derivative . This involve detail clinical laboratory study associate simultaneous assessment in-vitro several laboratory include - A . National Malaria Control Programme , Pnomh Penh B. Mahidol Oxford Research Unit ( MORU ) , Bangkok . C. Institut Pasteur , Pnomh Penh . D. Family Health International , Asia-Pacific Regional Office If artemisinin resistance confirm 1. plan containment need develop urgently . 2. molecular genetic study conduct determine basis resistance . 3 . Epidemiological behavioural study conduct inform resistance may select might contain This proposal describe initial clinical study would conduct Mahidol-University Research Unit , Bangkok together Family Health International leadership Cambodian NMCP . This open randomise PK-PD comparison artesunate versus artesunate-mefloquine . This clinical study conduct Pailin , poor parasitological response artesunate document . FHI take management village malaria worker programme Pailin , previously develop MSF , develop clinical facility . Trials artesunate-pyronaridine , coordinated FHI take place . 2.1 Method A detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation artesunate acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria conduct Pailin Hospital . 2.1.1.Timing Rainy season ( May December ) 2007 . 2.1.2 . Patients Children &gt; 5yrs adult present acute falciparum malaria ( N=40 ) Pailin hospital eligible inclusion study provide 1 . They parents/guardians give fully inform consent . 2 . They pregnant . 3 . They receive antimalarial drug previous 48 hour . 4 . P.falciparum parasitaemia exceed 10,000/uL . 5 . Microscopy indicate mixed infection . 6 . There history allergy artesunate mefloquine . 7 . They agree 7 day hospitalization . 2.1.3 . Recruitment , randomization enrolment : Fever patient villages surround Pailin Pailin screen PfHRP2-based malaria rapid test ( ParacheckR ) village malaria worker . In case positive test result , patient transport study team Pailin Referral Hospital , consent enrolment procedure conduct . It make clear outset refusal participate way jeopardize subsequent antimalarial treatment . 2.1.4.Patient information remuneration The detail study reason study explain Khmer patient relatives . It explain clearly patient want participate continue study affect treatment way . Patients recompense stay hospital travel expense outpatient visit appropriate local rate . If patient fulfils entry criterion inform consent obtain , patient enter study . Basic demographic clinical parameter , include blood pressure pulse rate , respiratory rate , temperature , weight , spleen liver size , enter case report form . 2.1.5 . Randomisation Computer-based randomisation balance previously prepared block 10 . 2.1.6 . 'Repeated dose ' If patient vomit within half hour intake antimalarial drug , dose repeat . If vomiting occur half whole hour , half dose repeat . 2.1.7 . 'Rescue treatment ' If patient develop sign severe malaria , parenteral artesunate parenteral quinine give standard dos [ 9 ] . The combination safe , would expect effective case high level artemisinin resistance [ 11 ] . If patient less 75 % fall parasitaemia day 3 persist parasitaemia day 7 , he/she require rescue treatment consist artesunate 6 mg/kg combination doxycycline 4 mg/kg 7 day . In child age 8 , doxycycline replace clindamycin ( 10 mg/kg/dose , two time day 7 day ) 2.2 . Procedures On enrollment detailed history full clinical examination perform recorded standard CRF . Part blood sample take baseline immediate culture ( in-vitro susceptibility test ) also storage parasite ( cryopreserved liquid nitrogen ) , parasite DNA mRNA . 2.2.1 . Drugs Patients randomize receive either 1 . Artesunate ( Guilin Pharmaceutical Company , PRC ) 2mg/kg/day 7 day . N=20………………………………………………………………………….AS7 2 . Artesunate ( Guilin Pharmaceutical Company , PRC ) 4mg/kg/day 3 day plus mefloquine 15mg/kg day 3 10mg/kg day 4 N=20………………………………………………………………………MAS3 2.2.2 . Blood collection admission On admission blood collect parasite count ( thin thick film stain Field 's method ) , CBC , routine biochemistry . An additional 20 ml blood collect sterile heparinised tube parasite culture cryopreservation , 2 ml assessment drug level ( artesunate mefloquine ) . The maximum volume take child &lt; 10yrs 10mL . 2.2.4 . Follow-up Patients remain hospital 7 day longer parasite clear . They follow 42 day weekly visit haematocrit parasite count check . 2.3 . Recurrent parasitaemia In case recurrent falciparum malaria blood take cryopreserving parasite , antimalarial drug level , assessment genotyping gene expression ( 22mL ) . The maximum volume take child &lt; 10yrs 10mL . In case recurrent parasitaemia , 3 day initiation treatment , DNA isolate blood sample . Paired sample every patient , take initial enrolment time recurrence , genotyped basis polymorphism gene merozoite surface protein MSP-2 MSP-1 GLURP . 3 . Measurements analysis This essentially descriptive study formal sample size calculation provide . 3.1 . Drug assay Artesunate , dihydroartemisinin mefloquine measure plasma sample . These assay perform MORU laboratory Bangkok . 3.1.2 . Analysis PK data Conventional population pharmacokinetic analysis perform ( MORU ) . A PK-PD model construct . Artesunate mefloquine characterize conventional population pharmacokinetic analysis . A population base pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling approach use describe antimalarial effect artesunate patient acute falciparum malaria . The objective modelling exercise characterise relationship pharmacokinetic variable parasite clearance measure . The clinical parasitological response compare previous data Thailand Cambodia . 3.2 In-vitro test On-site PfHRP2 base in-vitro testing perform . Parasites transport Pnomh Penh also cryopreserved later test . 3.2.1 . Molecular study There baseline genotyping described also systematic screen mixed infection . Putative resistance gene sequence ( e.g . PfATPase6 ) copy number expression assess ( PfMDR1 ) . 4 . Interim review option dose adjustment Monthly update recruitment therapeutic response provide participant study site . Artesunate produce parasite reduction ratio approximately 10,000/cycle , result parasite clearance time usually less 48 hour . If six patient either treatment group PCTs &gt; 96 hour dosage artesunate treatment arm increase AS7 2mg/kg/day increase AS7 4mg/kg/day MAS3 4mg/kg/day increase MAS3 6mg/kg/day The sample size review time . 5 . Treatment recurrent falciparum malaria infection Patients recurrent infection receive increase dose artesunate retreatment . Recurrent infection follow 7 day regimen receive artesunate 4 mg/kg/day 7 day . Recurrences follow MAS3 regimen receive artesunate 6 mg/kg/day 7 day Children age 8 year receive doxycycline 200mg day addition , 6 8 receive clindamycin 10mg/kg bid Patients recrudescence restudied provided agree .</detailed_description>
