	<brief_summary>Recent study indicate liver cancer cell possess receptor call GABA-B receptor activate , inhibits spread cancer cell test tube . One drug activate receptor Baclofen , agent originally develop treat patient various neurologic disorder . In study , patient recently identify liver cancer treat Baclofen attempt prevent delay spread cancer beyond liver . The time take liver cancer spread patient compare result obtain patient enrol previous study Baclofen use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Non-Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Humans Increasing Gabaergic Activity : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 47 consecutive patient radiologic histologic evidence non metastatic liver cancer enrol 2-4 year period . Subjects receive oral Baclofen manufacturer 's suggest maximal dose . Clinical , hematologic , biochemical , radiologic feature liver function , tumor metastasis recurrence monitor regular time interval 2 year treatment period . The primary study end point event interest ( time metastasis recurrence ) . Secondary end point include time metastasis follow recurrence , objective tumor response ( complete , partial non response ) , response duration , survival safety . It hop result study permit liver cancer patient remain candidate surgical resection transplantation longer would otherwise case .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis HCC evidence extrahepatic metastasis CT/MRI scan abdomen , CT chest brain negative bone scan . Patients undergo local therapy ( resection , ablation chemoembolization ) list liver transplantation exclude participate study . Patients multiple space occupy lesion within liver ( evidence extrahepatic metastasis ) continue eligible ( distinction regenerative nodule multifocal HCC versus intrahepatic metastasis make certainty presently available technique ) . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) â‰¥ 60 % . Age 18 year great . Life expectancy least 12 week . Concomitant Medications Patients stable dos medication ( change dose two week prior study initiation ) enter study . Patient consent must obtain patient prior entry trial . Patients must accessible treatment followup i.e . reside within reasonable geographical limit study site . Any investigational agent within minimum 6 week prior study treatment .

Patients capable reproduction must agree use appropriate method contraception study six month afterwards . Female patient childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test within 14 day study enrollment . Patients whose partner pregnant . Other serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol include : History psychiatric disorder would impair ability obtain consent followup tumor imaging . Active uncontrolled infection . Any known defect GABA metabolism hypersensitivity Baclofen . Patients previous organ allograft take immunomodulatory drug . Renal failure manage dialysis .</criteria>
