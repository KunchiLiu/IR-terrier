	<brief_summary>The purpose study : A ) To determine whether patient certain type heart attack ( NSTEMI ) reliably diagnose ambulance use telemedicine . This mandatory NSTEMI patient future treat acute balloon angioplasty ( primary PCI ) . B ) To evaluate whether primary PCI compare current regimen initial medical stabilization sub-acute PCI result reduction infarct-size NSTEMI-patients .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Balloon Angioplasty v . Traditional Early Invasive Treatment Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary PCI versus Traditional Early Invasive Treatment Patients present NSTEMI Patients NSTEMI currently admit initial evaluation stabilization local hospital . An intensive antithrombotic treatment initiate 3 - 7 day `` cooling-off '' patient refer invasive centre coronary angiography possibly PCI CABG - know early invasive approach . Some patient represent high-risk sub-group occlude sub-occluded coronary artery might benefit early revascularization . Study Aims 1 . To investigate technically feasible diagnose patient NSTEMI pre-hospital set reroute invasive heart centre primary PCI timely manner . 2 . To estimate area risk ( AAR = part cardiac muscle tissue risk infarction ) final infarct size ( FIS ) patient refer primary PCI patient undergoing traditional `` early invasive '' treatment , respectively . 3 . To investigate whether Primary PCI patient NSTEMI result short duration primary admission , few rehospitalizations reinfarction acute heart failure briefer overall `` sick leave '' within year index admission . Methods In study 300 consecutive patient symptom , clinical sign ECG change ( ≥4mm cumulate ≥ 2mm ST-segment depression ( horizontal descend ) two associated lead ) suggest significant NSTEMI randomize one two strategy , either ( A ) usual early invasive treatment ( coronary angiography possibly PCI 3 day ) ( B ) direct referral ( rerouting ) primary PCI invasive heart centre ( Skejby ) . All patient undergo myocardial perfusion image admission PCI 30 day estimate AAR , FIS possible myocardial salvage . All patient undergo cardiac MRI 7th day admission determination AAR FIS . The study randomize control study ; approve local ethic committee . Primary outcome measure specify If study confirm possible diagnose re-route NSTEMI patient primary PCI acceptable diagnostic accuracy , large scale mortality study plan . Furthermore , present study provide valuable information regard AAR FIS NSTEMI-patients may value plan larger-scale , scintigraphic study possible future use single MRI scan determine AAR FIS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients symptoms sign NSTEMI significant ECG change ( Either ≥4mm cumulate STsegment depression ( horizontal descending ) , ≥2mm STsegment depression ( horizontal descend ) two associated lead ) and/or patient positive biomarkers myocardial infarction ( troponin T ) measure ambulance ( prehospital measurement biomarkers ) . 2 . Age 18 year . 3 . Tentative diagnosis make prehospitally . 1 . Severe mental psychiatric disease ( eg . psychosis , dementia , bipolar disorder depression ) well condition make impossible obtain informed consent . 2 . Prior CABG ( Coronary artery bypass graft ) operation . 3 . Patients STdepression presume caused tachycardia cardiac hypertrophy .</criteria>
