	<brief_title>Safety Study Test Safety HspE7 Poly-ICLC Given Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 600 million people worldwide infect Human Papilloma Virus . In majority case people clear virus however case infection recognize left untreated , result cervical cancer . This study examine safety tolerability Hsp-E7 Poly-ICLC administer together vaccine Cervical Intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . There 4 cohort subject study give high dose one prior provide prior dose well tolerate deem safe . Subjects immunize every 28 day period 8 week ( 3 administration ) . Posttreatment evaluation occur 4 week last 3 injection . Subjects CIN 2 3 disease time enrollment eligible undergo clinically appropriate therapeutic treatment cervix twelfth study .</detailed_description>

Nonpregnant , Nonlactating female great equal 18 year age , either surgically sterile , postmenopausal ( menses previous 12 month ) , practice effective method birth control ( continue throughout study period ) determine Investigator ( eg : oral contraceptive , injectables implant , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method ) . The use cervical cap diaphram permit ) . 3 . Geographically accessible ongoing follow commit comply visit . 4 . Judged good health base upon result medical history , physical examination , vital sign laboratory profile . 5 . Capable understand comply protocol sign informed consent . 6 . Negative human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1 , HIV2 , Hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C Virus . Prior Therapy : 1 . Prior exposure HspE7 . 2 . The subject receive immunotherapy ( eg , interferon , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin , biological response modifier [ GM CSF , G CSF , M CSF ] ) within 4 week ( 28 day ) prior study entry . 3 . Taken within 7 day currently take selective Cox2 inhibitor nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug . 4 . Received investigational systemic drug within 4 week ( 28 day ) prior study entry . 5 . Undergoing active treatment genital wart . 6 . Has take astemizole within 7 day prior study drug administration . Disease Status : 1 . Has autoimmune disease opinion investigator would compromise safety subject study . Some example autoimmune disease may consider exclusionary include rheumatoid arthritis , systematic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune thyroiditis . 2 . Has recognize immunodeficiency disease , include cellular immunodeficiency , hypogammaglobulinemia , dysgammaglobulinemia . The subject hereditary congenital immunodeficiency . 3 . Has positive endocervical curettage time biopsy . Physiological Functions : 1 . Has clinically significant hepatic dysfunction ( ie , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , total bilirubin ≥1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 2 .
