	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To validate prognostic significance circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) patient newly diagnose metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . 2 . To prospectively determine assessment CTCs use stratify patient MBC two prognostic group independent exist method i.e . hormone-receptor status , site metastasis ( e.g . visceral vs. non visceral ) treatment administer ( e.g . chemotherapy vs. hormonal therapy ) . 3 . To incorporate information current TNM staging system sub-classifying stage IV disease two prognostic group , Stage IVA Stage IVB . Secondary Objective : 1 . To perform global gene profile select specimen correlate profile clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Validation Trial Circulating Tumor Cells ( CTCs ) Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients tumor spread part body start systemic treatment eligible take part study . As standard care , evaluation disease CT scan , bone scan , PET scan . Before begin routine treatment , participant study 3 teaspoon blood drawn M. D. Anderson clinic . This blood draw require study . You begin receive standard therapy disease decide treat physician . You follow-ups either physician research personnel ( phone call research nurse ) 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 36 month . After 36 month , follow-up continue indefinitely doctor 's discretion . At follow-ups , medical record review gather information study . One blood sample preserve use research development purpose specifically relate study . This research include also analysis tumor gene profile . This study do well understand biology metastatic breast cancer . Neither participant doctor take care tell result research . This investigational study . CellSearch ( technology use count circulate tumor cell ) approve FDA breast cancer prognosis . About 660 patient take part multicenter study . About 100 patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer . Patients must clinical and/or radiologic evidence stage IV disease . Tumor may hormone receptor type . Patients must newly diagnose stage IV breast cancer schedule start new systemic therapy . Patients may measurable nonmeasurable disease . Extent disease determine physical examination image study per primary physician . The test utilize may include : ( bone scan , PET/CT scan , CT abdomen , chest radiograph and/or CT chest visceral metastasis , sonogram and/or MRI soft tissue disease ) . Patients skin lesion photograph evaluate lesion . ECOG performance status 02 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy hospital . The acceptable consent form one attached end protocol . Patients evidence local regional recurrence exclude . Patients receive prior therapy metastatic breast disease . Patients know evidence brain metastasis ( unless previously treat stable ) carcinomatous meningitis . Patients history prior malignancy diseasefree least 5 year prior study entry . Patients unwilling unable give consent . Patients unwilling unable provide followup condition .</criteria>
