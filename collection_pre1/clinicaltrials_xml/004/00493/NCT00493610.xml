	<detailed_description>The Effects N-Acetylcysteine Oxidative Stress Chronic Hepatitis C Objective : There evidence suggest oxidative stress play role pathologic mechanism disease progression chronic hepatitis C virus infection ( HCV ) . This study test hypothesis N-acetylcysteine give one month decrease oxidative stress thus slow disease progression . Background : Chronic hepatitis C common blood borne infection United States . An average 230,000 new infection occur year 1980s , although since 1989 annual number new infection decline great 80 % 36,000 1996.1,2,3 A CDC survey 2003 show annual new case decline 30,000.4 The Third National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) , conduct 1988-1994 , indicate estimate 3.9 million ( 1.8 % ) Americans infect HCV . In general population , high prevalence rate HCV infection find among person age 30-49 year among male . Unlike racial/ethnic pattern acute disease , African Americans substantially high prevalence HCV infection whites.5 Population-based study indicate 40 % chronic liver disease HCV-related , result estimate death 8,000-10,000 year . According CDC , estimate medical work-loss cost HCV-related acute chronic liver disease great $ 600 million annually , HCV-associated end-stage liver disease frequent indication liver transplantation among adults.1 After acute infection , chronic HCV infection develop person ( 75 % -85 % ) . 6 The course chronic HCV insidious , progress slow rate without symptom physical sign majority patient first two decade . Cirrhosis develop 10 % -20 % person chronic HCV period 20-30 year , hepatocellular cancer 1 % -5 % .7 HCV replicate hepatocytes , directly hepatotoxic . Lymphocytes recognize infected cell initiate immune response . Damage liver parenchyma mediated inflammatory cytokine , although mechanism disease progression clearly understood . Jain et al . Pratico et al . show oxidative stress may factor progression fibrosis cirrhosis.8,9 It believe oxidative stress occur via various mechanism include reduction NAD NADH cause redox change inhibition xanthine dehydrogenase activity result shift purine oxidation xanthine oxidase , thereby promote generation oxygen-free radical specie . A depletion glutathione ( GSH ) also find chronic liver disease impair defense oxidative stress.10 Several study attempt evaluate oxidative stress associate HCV , recently accurate marker evaluation oxidative stress determine . Studies attempt treat chronic HCV interferon antioxidant combination inconclusive due inability appropriately measure oxidative stress.11 , 12 Guha et al . discuss long time , assessment lipid peroxidation vivo restrict tissue measurement alkane , malondialdehyde , hydroxynonenal level , serious limitation accurately assess oxidative stress . Roberts coworkers discover series novel prostaglandin , term F2-isoprostanes , consider gold standard assessment oxidative injury vivo . These prostaglandin form initially situ oxidation arachidonic acid contain phospholipid , release action phospholipase . These measure plasma urine sample use gas chromatography mass spectrometry ELISA.13-16 Recently , Dr. Vallyathan 's group West Virginia demonstrate total antioxidant status , glutathione peroxidase , isoprostane level increase shipyard welder consistent oxidative stress secondary occupational exposures.17 N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) precursor reduce GSH . It acetylate form amino acid L-cysteine , excellent source sulfhydryl group . It convert body metabolite capable stimulate GSH synthesis , promote detoxification , act directly free radical scavenger . It use clinically 30 year primarily monolithic . It commonly use pre-treatment prevent renal injury secondary intravenous dye patient renal insufficiency . It also mainstay treatment case acetaminophen overdose since 1980s . In time period , NAC show safe without significant toxicity side-effects.18 Other study show NAC prevent apoptosis promote cell survival . It reduce endothelial dysfunction , inflammation , fibrosis , cartilage erosion , transplant prolongation.19 It also useful improve ischemia-reperfusion relate liver injury , cocaine methanol relate liver injury.20-23 Considering information , would worthwhile evaluate baseline oxidative stress patient hepatitis C note change , NAC treatment 6 month . There prospective study thus far evaluated baseline oxidative stress Hep C patient interferon treatment evaluation F2-isoprostanes follow lab marker treatment NAC . Research design : Ten patient HCV proven PCR , treatment , recruit VA GI clinic patient population . Background data gather chart questionnaire . Blood baseline liver function test include serum ferritin , serum isoprostane , serum aconitase , plasma glutathione ( GSH ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) total antioxidant status ( TAS ) , obtain patient . These test repeat patient 15 day 1 month NAC 1000 mg mouth twice day . Tests repeat 30 day stop study medication . Hep c mRNA measure baseline 30 day . The research protocol explain patient inform consent obtain prior enrollment . For volunteer travel expense time , $ 25 give begin end study participation . Inclusion criterion follow : Volunteers divide 2 group : healthy patient HCV patient interferon . Exclusion criterion follow : significantly decompensated liver cirrhosis Child 's Class C , patient evidence liver mass hepatocellular cancer . Patients pregnant antioxidant Vitamin E Vitamin C also exclude . Also patient know allergy N-acetylcysteine exclude Sample Size calculation : Since patient control ( reduce potential confounding age , smoking , medicine , life style etc ) assume variance 5 % assay system biomarkers , 15 patient give 90 % power see 10 % difference aggregate level oxidant biomarkers . Statistical Analyses : Baseline demographic ( age , sex ) clinical data ( symptom , Child 's Classification ) collect patient . This data compare three group use Student 's t-test continuous variable either Chi-square Fisher 's exact test non-parametric variable . The measured laboratory value three group , baseline post N-acetylcysteine , compare use paired t-test .</detailed_description>
