	<brief_summary>The first aim study determine often unrecognized myocardial infarction occur patient use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique ( know delay enhancement MRI ) , compare electrocardiogram . The second aim study determine severity coronary heart disease patient unrecognized myocardial infarction . The final aim determine presence unrecognized myocardial infarction detect MRI affect lifespan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination Prevalence Prognostic Importance Unrecognized Non-Q-wave Myocardial Infarction MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unrecognized myocardial infarction ( MI ) know constitute substantial portion lethal coronary heart disease . However , since diagnosis unrecognized MI base appearance incidental Q-waves 12-lead electrocardiography , syndrome unrecognized non-Q-wave MI described . Delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( DE-CMR ) accurately identify non-Q-wave MI . The aim study three-fold : 1. determine prevalence unrecognized non-Q-wave Q-wave MI , 2. define predictor unrecognized non-Q-wave MI , 3. determine prognostic significance unrecognized non-Q-wave MI .</detailed_description>
