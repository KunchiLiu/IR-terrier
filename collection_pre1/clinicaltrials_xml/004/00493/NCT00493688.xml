	<brief_summary>To validate new method assess perioperative risk cancer patient undergo major cancer surgery . In propose study researcher : 1 . Measure preoperative energy reserve capacity ( fitness ) 2 . Determine postoperative morbidity function perioperative cardiopulmonary gas exchange metabolism</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Determine Whether Perioperative Energy Dynamics Correlates With Postoperative Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants study already schedule major abdominal pelvic cancer surgery . If agree take part study , exercise stationary bicycle , breathe mouthpiece wear nose clip , surgery . You ask pedal 60 revolution per minute resistance pedal gradually increase . During pedaling , vital sign monitor use blood pressure cuff , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) lead ( measure electrical activity heart ) , pulse oximeter . The mouthpiece use analyze inhaled v exhale breath . The nose clip remind breathe mouthpiece . This help researcher learn level oxygen uptake exercise , surgery . You stop test become tire . The length test vary participant participant . You ask question help rate well able move physically , base two independent form . These form rate physical status accord 2 scale ( 0 4 , 10 100 , respectively ) , high score mean less difficulty physical movement low score mean difficulty physical movement . You ask complete brief form ask 12 question ability perform activity daily live . Examples include ; Can take care ? Can climb flight stair ? You also contact telephone 30 day , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year surgery ask 12 question . If unable reach telephone , questionnaire mail home return , postage pay envelope include . It take 5 minute complete . Once complete 2-year questionnaire , participation study . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . Between 180-200 patient per surgical group take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient 18 year age old . 2 . Patients schedule elective major intrabdominal surgery pelvic surgery surgery ( e.g . gastrectomy , esophagectomy , pancreatectomy , radical cystectomy , radical transabdominal debulking without intrabdominal hyperthermic perfusion , pelvic exenteration , retroperitoneal lymph node dissection , low anterior resection ) . 3 . Patients sign consent form participate study . 4 . Patients must evaluate Preanesthesia Clinic staff Anesthesiologist preoperatively . 5 . All laboratory diagnostic evaluation require used evaluate patient Preanesthesia Clinic must complete . All patient must approve surgery standard Preanesthesia Clinic . 1 . Patient age 18 2 . Patient unwilling sign consent . 3 . Patient unable exercise . ( Bedridden wheel chair bound ) 4 . Patient enrol another study deem investigator affect oxygen metabolic efficiency presently standard care MDACC . 5 . Any patient whose condition deem unsatisfactory surgery preanesthetic evaluation . The patient may reenter study reevaluation Preanesthesia Clinic determine suitable surgery . 6 . Surgery cancel reason . The patient may reenter study surgery reschedule . 7 . Patient myocardial infarction within 3 month visit Preanesthesia Clinic present new unstable angina 8 . Patient history cerebrovascular accident transit ischemic attack within 3 month visit Preanesthesia Clinic . 9 . Patient history pulmonary embolic event within 3 month visit Preanesthesia Clinic . 10 . Patient know acute chronic deep vein thrombosis . 11 . Pregnant patient .</criteria>
