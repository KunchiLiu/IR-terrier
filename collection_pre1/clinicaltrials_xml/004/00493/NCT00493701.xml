	<brief_title>`` ADAPT '' The Adaptation High Fat Diets Extention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past 3 year identify `` thrifty-phenotype '' characterize lean men inability adapt rapidly high fat diet associate low maximal VO2 high fasting insulin . We hypothesize individual `` thrifty phenotype '' high risk become obese , exercise may effective overcoming problem . Several question remain answered regard `` thrifty '' phenotype . First , give large interindividual difference , identify high risk ? What distinguish biochemical , endocrine environmental characteristic individual store fat expose high fat diet ? This important individual easily identify , dietary intervention target `` at-risk '' population . Second , different individual `` thrifty phenotype '' ? Are cellular pathway dysregulated skeletal muscle individual compare control ? Is defect intrinsic , i.e . diminish ability conserve glucose oxidize fat skeletal muscle alternately , phenotype due environmental , dietary factor inactivity energy excess ? To answer question , plan three-year project aim : - Characterize biochemical , endocrine , anthropometric environmental characteristic individual `` thrifty '' phenotype . - Identify signal pathway skeletal muscle dysregulated individual `` thrifty '' phenotype mRNA expression profile skeletal tissue . - Determine role environmental factor inactivity caloric intake vs. intrinsic ( genetic ) factor `` thrifty '' phenotype .</detailed_description>
