	<detailed_description>Food stimulation gastric pancreatic secretion classically divide cephalic , gastric intestinal phase . Cephalic phase refers simultaneous activation gastrointestinal motility , gastric acid pancreatic enzyme secretion , well , release hormone endocrine pancreas occurs activation vagal -efferents result food-related sensory stimulus taste smell prior nutrient absorption coincides thermogenic response . Of cephalic phase secretion , cephalic phase insulin release ( CPIR ) receive attention , pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) glucagon response also study . While magnitude cephalic phase insulin release relatively small ( 25 % baseline ) , pancreatic polypeptide increase 100 % baseline . The large magnitude PP response make sensitive indicator vagal activation food stimulus . In experiment , subject either expose visual olfactory stimulation see smell food stimulus require perform modify sham-feed , i.e . taste , chew expectorate food stimulus . In general , cephalic phase think preparatory response ingestion food . Because small magnitude , physiological significance cephalic phase hormonal response largely discount . However , evidence experimental prevention CPIR lead hyperinsulinemia hyperglycemia . Therefore , CPIR may contribute glucose homeostasis /regulation . Moreover CPIR may indicator hunger could important understand eat disorder . In parallel hormonal secretion , increase energy expenditure also observe .This thermogenic response food even great sham feeding normal feeding parallel change RQ show enhanced carbohydrate oxidation . Disorders taste prevalent symptom patient undergoing chemotherapy . The literature suggest 36 % to71 % patient report distress change taste often negative impact quality life nutrition . It unknown whether cephalic phase oncology patient may also disturb .</detailed_description>
