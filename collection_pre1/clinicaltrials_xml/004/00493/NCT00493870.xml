	<brief_title>TAC Versus TC Adjuvant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both TAC ( docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ) TC ( docetaxel cyclophosphamide ) establish adjuvant chemotherapy regimens early stage breast cancer . TAC , however , due inclusion anthracycline doxorubicin , carry high risk hematologic cardiotoxic adverse effect . Substantial evidence support concept early stage HER2-negative breast cancer benefit similarly anthracycline-based adjuvant non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Further , approximately 0 9 % HER2-negative breast cancer alteration TOP2A gene , may predict benefit anthracycline-based chemotherapy . We hypothesize 6 cycle TC versus 6 cycle TAC similar efficacy treatment early stage HER2-negative breast cancer TC less toxicity . If hypothesis upheld anthracycline doxorubicin could eliminate regimen obtain similar efficacy population patient , would important advance understanding biology cancer , would also significant clinical benefit woman breast cancer .</detailed_description>

In determine eligibility abnormal 2 value ( AST ALT ) use . See protocol specific detail Has normal cardiac function evidence LVEF &gt; 50 % , WNL institutional standard multiple gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan . An echocardiogram ( ECHO ) may use MUGA available , modality must use consistently throughout study evaluate LVEF . Ejection fraction determine ECHO must WNL institutional standard . Has evidence metastatic disease outside breast physical examination chest xray . Other scan do need patient ( eg , bone scan ; abdominal , chest CT ; PET PET/CT ; ultrasound ; MRI indicate evidence metastatic disease Has baseline bilateral mammography It &lt; 84 day since date definitive surgery ( eg , mastectomy , case breastsparing procedure , axillary dissection ) adequate wound healing , determine Treating Physician Has negative serum pregnancy test within 7 calendar day prior registration ( female patient childbearing potential [ surgically sterilize menarche 1 year postmenopause ] ) If fertile , patient agree use acceptable method birth control ( barrier contraceptive ) avoid pregnancy duration study period 3 month thereafter Has adequate tumor specimen available FISH analysis TOP2A status ( See Appendix VI ) .
