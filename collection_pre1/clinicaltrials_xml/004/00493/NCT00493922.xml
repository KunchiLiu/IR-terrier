	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND There good evidence multiple site , include Ghana , malaria massively over-diagnosed . It could argue microscopy available introduce , elsewhere improve , high-quality microscopy easy sustain . If substantial over-diagnosis continue Ghana era ACT first-line treatment , lead intervention substantially expensive due over-prescription , potentially render unsustainable . The introduction rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) potential provide way accurately direct ACTs need may also encourage clinician consider alternative diagnosis test-negative case , reduce risk miss treatable , potentially fatal , alternative cause febrile illness . RDTs direct ACT use also possibility cost-effective , clinician prescribe logically basis test result . Initial data Tanzania suggest provide RDTs context formal healthcare setting may little impact clinician behaviour , health system Ghana different , clinician patient belief malaria likely different . Additionally , properly test area little access microscopy , ACTs currently available , may influence clinician behaviour . Many believe useful set RDTs , may limit over-prescription anti-malarials data support belief , data cost-effectiveness approach . This trial aim test impact RDT use clinician behaviour directly mean randomised trial . OBJECTIVES Principal Objective To determine mean randomize trial impact introduction Rapid Diagnostic Tests ( RDTs ) appropriate prescription anti-malarials two public healthcare setting find Ghana . Specifically , 1 . To determine mean randomize trial impact introduce RDTs appropriate prescription anti-malarials set diagnosis currently purely clinical . 2 . To determine mean randomize trial impact introduce RDTs appropriate prescription anti-malarials set microscopy available . 3 . To determine sensitivity specificity RDTs diagnosis malaria . 4 . To explore clinician patient perception use RDTs versus clinical diagnosis management malaria . 5 . To explore clinician patient perception use RDTs versus microscopy management malaria . 6 . To determine cost-effectiveness RDTs diagnosis malaria setting . In case RDT compare standard care health centre . METHODS The study carry Dangme West District southern part Ghana . It individually randomize control trial 1 . Baseline data initially collect period one month document normal pattern diagnose malaria clinicians health facility . At health centre , patient microscopy request research slide take time laboratory result clinic slide document . 2 . Exit interview patient record review conduct find whether patient prescribe anti-malarial confirm whether do clinical ground basis microscopy . Their prescription document . At community clinic well , research slide take patient diagnosis malaria prescribe anti-malarial . Record review outpatient department ( OPD ) card patient diagnosis malaria receive anti-malarial carried also document present symptom . 3 . For main trial , patient visit health facility meet inclusion criterion eligible enrolment study . Allocations either microscopy RDT health centre either clinical diagnosis RDT community clinic computer generate . The allocation place sequentially number seal opaque envelope prior-labelled unique study ID number . Patients identified consent seek exit consulting room . If clinician request laboratory test , patient send laboratory research assistant open seal envelope presence patient find allocation . The allocated test carry research slide take time . The lab result write usual case microscopy dipstick result record sent clinician reading well . 4 . At community clinic laboratory , process identification eligible patient , seek consent allocation study arm similar health centre . However , set , depend allocation seal envelope , rapid diagnostic test either carry research assistant print card `` clinical diagnosis '' write give patient . In case RDT , result record dipstick sent clinician clinician-read diagnosis subsequent treatment . Whether patient assigned clinical diagnosis RDT , research assistant prepare research slide per patient air dry later batch reading . 5 . The presenting symptom , temperature presentation , laboratory result , clinician 's diagnosis treatment patient recruit study document . Prescriptions give documented exit . In addition , contact address collect exit consent seek facilitate easy location recruitment focus group discussion later . 6 . The gold standard whether child adult malaria slide-proven malaria parasitaemia measure double-read research slide . Research slide Giemsa stain read two independent microscopist would blind study allocation test result . They use clinician treatment decision . 7 . At end trial , individual in-depth interview conduct main clinician focus group discussion hold clinician participate health facility . The aim explore perception regard use clinical diagnosis , microscopy RDT diagnosis malaria practice regard . 8 . A random selection patient three health facility contact participate focus group discussion end trial . There least two focus group discussion comprise 8-12 discussant health facility . These discussion carry mean interview guide . The discussion conduct local language record tape recorder . In setting data collect cost-effectiveness study .</detailed_description>
