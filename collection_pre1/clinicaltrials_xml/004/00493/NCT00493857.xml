	<brief_summary>This study determine nimotuzumab provide benefit type cancer give combination irinotecan . The study test : - How long good effect last . - How bad side effect . Objectives : Primary : The primary goal assess Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) combination irinotecan nimotuzumab produce patient irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer Secondary : - To assess incidence Grade 2 great acneiform rash infusion reaction , allergic reaction anaphylactoid reaction AEs patient irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer follow weekly 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedule ; - To assess Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) , define time date randomization date disease progression ( clinical radiological ) death due cause , two nimotuzumab schedule ; - To assess rate duration Stable Disease ( SD ) follow weekly 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedule ; - To assess Time Disease Progression ( TTP ) follow weekly 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedule ; - To evaluate ORR patient identify `` primary '' irinotecan resistance follow weekly 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedule ; - To evaluate Overall Survival ( OS ) follow weekly 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedule ; - To compare two dose schedule nimotuzumab respect objective response rate safety ; - To evaluate overall safety toxicity profile two dose regimen nimotuzumab ; - To evaluate trough level accumulation nimotuzumab serum patient receive drug weekly 2-weekly regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient receive nimotuzumab every 2 week plus irinotecan . Nimotuzumab give dose 400 mg every 2 week 12 week . Irinotecan give dose schedule last dose schedule give recent pre-study irinotecan contain therapy . If tumour show sign growth 12 week treatment , patient continue receive nimotuzumab 400 mg every 2 week 18 month long get benefit drug .</detailed_description>
