	<brief_title>Phase I Study Gimatecan Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Gimatecan design block function important protein ( topoisomerase I ) cancer cell help repair damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) . When protein block , cancer cell may die . Screening Tests : Before start receiving study drug , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . - You physical exam . - Your complete medical history record . - Your vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature ) , height , weight measure . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - You ask medication may take . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Women able child must negative blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . - You bone marrow aspirate perform . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . - If doctor think necessary , bone marrow biopsy bone marrow aspirate do . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . - You complete questionnaire see disease may affect ability daily activity . The questionnaire take 15 minute complete . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , amount study drug receive base join study . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol study give certain dose . If experience intolerable side effect , next 3-6 participant enrol receive high dose . This process continue researcher find high dose drug give without cause serious intolerable side effect . The study doctor tell dose receive compare dose participant receive . Study Drug Administration : You take gimatecan Days 1-5 . On Days 6-28 , take study drug . Each 28-day period call study `` cycle . '' If doctor think necessary , study cycle may shorten receive study drug often . You take medication empty stomach , swallow capsule whole . You eat 1 hour take medication . If take medication study , must take 4 hour take gimatecan . Study Visits : Blood ( 2 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test every 1-4 week length study . Most blood test do week , do every 4 week . You physical exam every 4 week first 3 month , every 3 month . At end Cycle 1 , every 9-12 week , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy . Bone marrow biopsy aspirate may collect often study doctor think necessary . Once per week first 3 cycle , complete symptom questionnaire . This do either study visit , call member study staff . The questionnaire take 15 minute complete . Length Study : You remain study 12 month . If , time , consider gimatecan help , study doctor discus possibility continue study drug therapy outside study . You may take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit : Once study , end-of-study visit , follow test perform . - You physical exam . - You ask side effect may experience . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You repeat symptom questionnaire . This investigational study . Gimatecan FDA approve commercially available . It authorize use research . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients MDS &gt; /= 5 % blast IPSS risk group intermediate ( 1 2 ) high ( i.e. , IPSS score 0.5 high ) . 2 . Patients must fail prior therapy either chemotherapy ( e.g. , araCbased chemotherapy , etc ) biologic agent ( e.g. , hypomethylating agent , arsenic , thalidomide , CC5013 , farnesyl transferase inhibitor , ATG , cyclosporine , etc ) . 3 . Age &gt; /= 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use Gimatecan patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 5 . Patients must normal organ function define : 1 ) Total bilirubin : &lt; /= 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ; 2 ) ALT ( SGPT ) : &lt; /= 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ; 3 ) Creatinine : &lt; /= 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal . 6 . The effect Gimatecan develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential ( ie , postmenopausal least 12 month surgically sterile ) men must agree use doublebarrier contraception prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month follow discontinuation study treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 7 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients receive supportive care ( transfusion and/or hematopoietic growth factor ) MDS . 2 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week 5 halflives agent question ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) , whichever great , prior enter study recover least grade 1 adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . The use hydroxyurea allow 48 hour prior start therapy Gimatecan . 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , active uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia require respond medical intervention , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Women pregnant breastfeeding .</criteria>
