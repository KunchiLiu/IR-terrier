	<detailed_description>For patient spinal fusion indicate , posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( PLIF ) may recommend restore stability affect spinal segment1 . Pioneered Dr.Cloward 1940s treat painful intervertebral disc damage degeneration , PLIF involve removal entire nuclear portion disc subsequent replacement multiple block transplant bone . The purpose fusion eliminate reduce amount motion affect site , , therefore , source pain . Four major intervertebral cage approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use human : Brantigan Interbody fusion Cage , Ray Threaded Fusion Cage , Bagby Kuslich cage , , recently , Trabecular Metal™ Cage . Comprised 98 percent tantalum 2 percent vitreous carbon , Trabecular Metal™ high coefficient friction implant material market , allow optimal initial implant-bone fit . Furthermore , unique porous structure Trabecular Metal™ provide significantly space tissue ingrowth occur , facilitate cohesive implant-bone interface well long-term stability implant . Long-term follow data efficacy Brantigan Interbody fusion cage , Ray Threaded Fusion cage , Bagby Kuslich cage limit , rigorous study ( i.e . control prospective study ) typically provide outcome approximately 2 year post-surgery . Overall , study show , exist intervertebral cage make significant advance term address disadvantage associate traditional bone grafting/fixation technique , problem continue persist . Through comprehensive accurate clinical evaluation Trabecular Metal™ intervertebral cage , Research Team hop document advance PLIF technique , thereby inform current research well clinical practice . The primary goal propose research gather data clinical efficacy Trabecular Metal™ Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion ( PLIF ) cage pedicle screw instrumentation treatment one-level lumbar spine fusion . Based pilot data , hope establish level acceptable clinical performance Trabecular Metal™ cage , benchmark subsequent investigation compare . Direct surgical exploration consider reliable method accurately determine fusion success , structural functional perspective , follow spinal fusion surgery . Unfortunately , method highly invasive , costly seldom use . Furthermore , surgical exploration provide longitudinal information stability implant , include monitor occurrence migration . In contrast , Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis ( RSA ) detect presence absence mobility intervertebral segment ( i.e . functional stability fusion ) high degree accuracy . RSA radiographic technique use small tantalum ball implant patient 's bone measure micromotion ( &lt; 1 mm ) bone - implant interface , something possible reliably use regular x-ray technique . RSA provide method detect inferior implant design cement formulation use small number patient release product large clinical trial . RSA use several decade , safety well documented.A computerize , digital RSA system recently instal calibrated center . Its measurement capability rigorously validate , currently use assess new knee implant design . Expansion system include spine RSA easily accomplish .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must least 20 year age Clinical radiologic history spondylolisthesis ( great grade 1 ) Spinal stenosis conservative treatment fail Degenerative disc disease , characterize one following : instability ( define angular motion &gt; 5° and/or translation &gt; 4mm , base Flex/Ext radiograph ) osteophyte formation decrease disc height thicken ligamentous tissue disc degeneration herniation facet joint degeneration Fusion one level Nonfusion surgery involve level Previously diagnose osteopenia , osteoporosis , osteomalacia degree spinal instrumentation would contraindicate Patients highlycommunicable disease , inflammatory autoimmune base joint disease Those history endocrine metabolic disorder know affect osteogenesis ( e.g . Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , EhlersDanios syndrome osteogenesis imperfecta ) Patients documented titanium tantalum alloy allergy intolerance Patients currently receive active treatment cancer treatment steroid cortisone Patients significant medical history , Investigator 's opinion , would make good study candidate</criteria>
