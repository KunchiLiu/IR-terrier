Cutaneous , low extremity ulcer foot ≥1.5 ≤10.0 cm² size Wagner Classification Grade 1 appearance . Note Ulcer area must calculate Screening Visit Treatment Day ( Day 1 ) use measurement obtain trace ulcer perimeter debridement confirm patient eligibility prior randomization . Documented ulcer presence ≥6 week prior sign inform consent form Recently debrided ulcer ( within 2 week screen visit ) Ulcer free necrotic soft tissue Affected limb transcutaneous partial pressure oxygen ( TcpO2 ) &gt; 40mmHg ; toe pressure ≥40mmHg ; Doppler waveform consistent adequate flow foot ( biphasic triphasic waveform ) screen Inability perceive 10 gram pressure use SemmesWeinstein 5.07 monofilament periulcer area Willing adhere wear offload orthopedic shoe 16 week ( i.e. , 2 week ulcer closure ) start Day 14 ( first day screen runin period ) Willing adhere wear customize shoe durability phase study Females childbearing potential must negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone ( ßhCG ) test result sample obtain 7 day prior Treatment Day 1 neither breastfeed intend become pregnant study All individual ( study patients/partners ) childbearing potential must agree use method contraception deem acceptable Investigator agree remain abstinent throughout study Be able understand sign inform consent form enter study , must willing comply study procedures Any unstable medical condition judge Investigator Medical Monitor would cause study detrimental patient Hemoglobin Alc ( HbA1c ) test result &gt; 12 % document Screening Visit Ulcers cause primarily untreated vascular insufficiency ; ulcer etiology relate diabetes Ulcers heel More three ulcer target low extremity The ulcer study anatomically distinct another ulcer ( ) ( i.e. , separate &lt; 1 cm another ulcer would interfere standard care treatment another ulcer ) . Only single ulcer treat study . Ulcers decrease area &gt; 30 % screen 2week runin period Ulcers underlie osteomyelitis Patients present clinical characteristic cellulitis ulcer site ( suppurative inflammation involve particularly subcutaneous tissue , often mild erythema , tenderness , malaise , chill fever ) If either beta hemolytic streptococci ( amount ) total bacterial load &gt; 1e6 CFU/gram tissue present screen biopsy sample ulcer site , patient give single 7day course topical antibiotic redebrided biopsied quantitative culture . A second biopsy exceed limit result exclusion study due high risk local infection may adversely affect ulcer closure .
