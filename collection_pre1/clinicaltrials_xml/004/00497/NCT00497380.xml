	<brief_summary>Muscle catabolism major problem cancer patient undergo surgery negatively affect post-operative recovery . Recent evidence exist protein metabolic change already apparent cancer muscle waste present . In line , patient breast cancer , generally characterize normal nutritional status , recently find arginine deficient . Arginine deficiency cancer explain : 1 ) Reduced arginine availability , due exhaustion endogenous ( muscle ) source arginine 2 ) Enhanced arginine catabolism , due conversion arginine arginase , abundant tumor . Protein important endogenous source arginine . Arginine deficiency lead negative feedback loop cachexia promote protein breakdown attempt restore plasma arginine level . We hypothesize pre-operative arginine supplementation breast cancer patient diminish occurrence muscle waste surgery 1 ) normalize arginine availability pre-operatively , result conservation protein , 2 ) diminish catabolic effect surgery supply exogenous arginine post-operative response , 3 ) enhance anabolic capacity feed supply substrate protein synthesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arginine Feeding : Novel Strategy Improve Protein Metabolism Cancer Response Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In present proposal , effect surgery cancer examine compare subject undergo breast surgery malignancy vs. prophylactic reason ( aim 1 ) . Furthermore , effect one-week pre-operative protein feed without enrichment arginine post-operative protein metabolism ( aim 2 ) investigate cancer group . Variables interest : 1 . Whole-body skeletal muscle protein metabolism , whole body arginine turnover de-novo arginine production rate , anabolic capacity feeding ( assess stable isotope methodology ) . 2 . Body weight , muscle mass functional status , score well-being ( assess Profile Mood State Mini Mental State ) . In present study , propose nutritional supplement high protein content enhance arginine effective typical commercial nutritional supplement diminish catabolic effect surgery subject cancer , thereby optimize quality life . If find case , would provide basis reformulate nutritional composition accord effect cancer surgery protein metabolism .</detailed_description>
