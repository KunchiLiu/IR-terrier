	<brief_summary>Peripheral nerve block provide many advantage patient ( excellent pain control reduction nausea ) undergo upper low limb surgery however several commonly occur complication produce annoy sometimes serious adverse effect . The interscalene brachial plexus block ( ISBPB ) one technique , commonly perform shoulder surgery , also produce paralysis diaphragm , Horner 's syndrome sometimes vocal cord paralysis standard volume local anesthetic . This threat side effect limit use ISBPB many patient would particularly benefit e.g . patient lung disease . Recently use ultrasound guidance allow practitioner place small volume local anesthetic much great accuracy . This potentially avoid anesthetize important adjacent nerve target structure . If ultrasound-guided technique small volume local anesthetic could demonstrate reduce incidence complication without reduce effectiveness would beneficial patients.This first randomize , double blind study evaluate ultrasound-guided ISBPB low volume local anesthetic reduce complication patient whilst maintain quality anesthesia pain relief intra-operative postoperative period .</brief_summary>
