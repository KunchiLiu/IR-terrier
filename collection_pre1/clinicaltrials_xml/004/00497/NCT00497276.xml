	<brief_summary>The useful method manage pain major foot ankle surgery infusion local anesthetic catheter close sciatic nerve popliteal space knee joint . Inaccurate catheter placement spread local anesthetic account failure . The prevalent method place catheter traditional nerve stimulation technique rely surface anatomic landmarks electrical stimulation localize sciatic nerve . In recent year ultrasound technique apply provide real-time , visual guidance catheter placement . The purpose randomized , control trial compare success rate , patient acceptance cost-effectiveness ultrasound nerve stimulation technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Foot ankle surgery typically painful first two day postoperatively due surgical oedema . This pain difficult control systemic analgesic . Pain relief systemic analgesic require high dos intravenous opioids associate breakthrough pain adverse effect opioids ( sedation , nausea , vomit , obstipation , urinary retention , mouth dryness , respiratory depression , pruritus , vertigo visual disturbance ) . Single-shot technique provide analgesia two 30 hour even use analgesic prolonged effect ( bupivacaine , levobupivacaine , ropivacaine ) . The duration block depend local analgesic anatomical location . Popliteal block bupivacaine last 24 hour . Continuous , peripheral nerve block catheter technique two day minimizes need systemic analgesic adverse effect . Continuous , peripheral nerve block gain popularity foot ankle surgery , good analgesia obtain compare intravenous opioids , similar analgesia few adverse effect compare epidural catheter technique . Today nerve stimulation technique prevalent technique introduce catheter peripheral nerve block . The success rate postoperative analgesia foot ankle surgery popliteal catheter variable - typically 70 % department . The patient catheter failure severe postoperative pain , high opioid dosage , cognitive blurring , nausea , vomiting , reduce ambulation , increase surgical stress response increase morbidity . Pain problem adverse effect prolongs postoperative observation time maybe also time discharge . Ultrasound technique employ peripheral nerve block first time 1978 . However utility technically limited . In recent year , evolution high-frequency transducer mobile ultrasound unit facilitate application ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block . This technique allow dynamic visualization nerve , needle tip location spread local analgesic real-time . The empirical basis support theoretical advantage ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia consist mainly observational study . A , randomize , control trial compare ultrasound- nerve stimulation technique favour benefit ultrasound concern success rate , sensory onset time , duration block , patient satisfaction quality block . The purpose study establish whether ultrasound technique high success rate , good patient satisfaction high cost-effectiveness compare electrical nerve stimulation use popliteal , sciatic catheter postoperative analgesia foot ankle surgery .</detailed_description>
