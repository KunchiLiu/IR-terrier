	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Using Endodontic Self Adjusting File - SAF Root Canal Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endodontic treatment ( root canal treatment ) conduct dental pulp inflame become necrotic infect . The main cause case dental caries represent sequential stage disease inflammation precede necrosis infection . Mechanically , condition treat rather similar manner , `` clean shaping '' , use endodontic file irrigation solution . This mechanical process aim thoroughly disinfect root canal remove tissue remnant enlarge diameter root canal , remove canal irregularity may harbor bacteria . During process inner layer dentin remove surface root canal . A second goal root canal treatment allow adequate seal canal space root canal filling , order prevent future bacterial contamination . For teeth inflame vital pulp , stage complete root canal may seal . When necrotic infect root canal involve , stage greatly reduce bacterial load canal additional stage disinfection medicament , seal canal next appointment , may require . The SAF file endodontic file design operate Profin dental low-speed hand-piece ( W &amp; H , Burmoos / Salzburg , Austria ) , convert rotation transline reciprocal movement . The active part file manufacture thin-walled tube medical grade nickel-titanium alloy . It cylindrical shape compress allow insertion thin root canal , due lattice-like structure . The SAF file endodontic file revolutionary design . As endodontic file design remove dentin root canal wall enlarge canal . Its advantage : - grind inner root canal wall , rather machine-cut , - adapts cross section canal enlarges wider version original form . - It enlarge canal ; use one instrument gradually expand size , rather tediously use sequence instrument . - Its hollow space allow continuous irrigation flush ground material rather tediously stop remove instrument root canal flush , - highly resistant breakage The tested device engine-operated endodontic file use root canal treatment . It construct medical grade nickel-titanium alloy design hollow tube make delicate metal lattice , attach dental hand-piece . It operate root canal continuous rinse . The rinse solution enters hollow device special irrigator attachment , flow root canal emerges access cavity , collect use dental suction tip .</detailed_description>
