	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study GCSF Therapy Treat Patients High Risk Chemotherapy Induced Severe Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Filgrastim recombinant human G-CSF ( rhG-CSF ) develop mid 1980s , approve United States ( US ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use chemotherapy induce neutropenia 1991 trade name Neupogen® . Filgrastim first approve EU Germany 2001 trade name . Filgrastim non glycosylated protein , produce E. coli bacteria transfected rhG-CSF copy deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) . Filgrastim differs native human G CSF addition N terminal methionine require expression bacterial host . In 2002 , pegylated filgrastim extend duration action relative naked filgrastim approve FDA EU Commission trade name Neulasta . AviGenics generate transgenic hen carry rhG CSF cDNA , express glycosylated form rhG-CSF protein egg white . The purified rhG-CSF biologically active , assessed vitro bind cell proliferation activity , fully characterize AviGenics . AviGenics intend develop product treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia . The overall goal study assess dose response , efficacy , safety three different dose level AVI-014 ( G-CSF ) breast cancer patient high ( &gt; 20 % ) risk chemotherapy induce severe neutropenia .</detailed_description>
