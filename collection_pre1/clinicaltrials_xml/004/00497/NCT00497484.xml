	<detailed_description>Albright ’ Hereditary Osteodystrophy rare autosomal dominant disease characterize constellation physical feature include short stature , central obesity , round face , brachydactyly , subcutaneous calcification mental retardation . In family , may present associated end organ resistance action different hormone , primarily PTH , TSH gonadotropins case name PHP type Ia , contrary may find isolated defect case PPHP . In 80 % affected family , heterozygous loss function mutation Gs alpha gene detect . It interest mutation inherit mother always lead complete form disorder , PHP ; contrary mutation inherit father , patient show physical abnormality Albright ’ Osteodystrophy , without evidence hormone resistance . This pattern inheritance consistent tissue-specific paternal imprinting Gs alpha gene . Imprinting epigenetic phenomenon one 2 allele undergoes partial total loss expression ; case Gs alpha gene one would expect paternal allele lose specific endocrine tissue , kidney , thyroid gonad , target organ resistant hormone action PHP Ia . Indeed , group demonstrate specific human endocrine tissue also Gs alpha transcription mainly derive maternal allele ( Mantovani et al. , J Clin Endocrinol Metab , 2002 . 87 : 4736-4740 ) . In particular predominant maternal origin transcription find thyroid gonad data consistent clinical finding TSH gonadotropin resistance present patient affect PHP . Interestingly , observe predominance maternal allele also pituitary gland , organ classically include among target organ resistant hormone action PHP Ia . Following observation , recently demonstrate resistance GHRH lead GH deficiency patient PHP Ia ( Mantovani et al. , J Clin Endocrinol Metab , 2003 . 88 : 4070-4074 ) . The purpose study evaluate effect least 1-year GH replacement patient . In particular , focus attention growth velocity child affect disease .</detailed_description>
