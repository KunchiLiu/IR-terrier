	<brief_title>Androgen Therapy Breast Cancer Patients With Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Side-Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anastrozole ( Arimidex® ) selective aromatase inhibitor ( drug interfere make oestrogen ) . Reduction serum oestrogen level hormone-receptor positive breast cancer patient clearly beneficial delay regrowth breast cancer cell body . Anastrozole effective reduce serum oestrogen level result several significant side-effects 2 significant importance ; joint pain stiffness bone thin osteoporosis . The question ask trial replacement testosterone woman receive Anastrozole reduction 2 common side-effects . Women normally circulate blood 3 major sex hormone : oestrogen , testosterone progesterone . Each produced ovary . Oestrogen also make throughout body particularly body fat . Testosterone also make part body hormone ( DHEA DHEAS ) produce adrenal gland . At time natural menopause , surgical removal ovary destruction ovary chemotherapy , oestrogen progesterone level fall precipitously . Testosterone level however fall gradually increase age woman forties average half testosterone circulate bloodstream woman twenty . After woman ovary remove surgery destroyed chemotherapy testosterone level fall fifty percent . However testosterone change across menopause , although varies somewhat woman . Testosterone know many physiological role woman . Firstly , oestrogen actually make testosterone , without ability body make testosterone make oestrogen . Testosterone appear direct independent effect different part body , woman may experience variety physical symptom blood level fall . Anastrazole almost completely blocks formation oestrogen testosterone . Thus question ask trial , increase blood level testosterone reduce specific side-effects cause reduction availability hormones joint bone .</detailed_description>
