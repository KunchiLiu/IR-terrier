	<brief_summary>Asthma serious global health problem . People age country throughout world affect chronic airway disorder severe sometimes fatal . The prevalence asthma increase everywhere , especially among children.According international guideline , control asthma achieve maintain least 3 month , gradual reduction maintenance therapy try order identify minimum therapy require maintain control . This help reduce risk side effect enhance patient adherence treatment plan . Reduction therapy patient combination therapy begin reduction dose inhale glucocorticosteroid.1 The present study design evaluate patient control asthma treat FP 1000 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily step . Stepping-down attempted two medication : new combination extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate 400 mcg + formoterol 24 mcg daily ( test medication , Foster™ ) , alternatively , fluticasone propionate 500 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily ( reference medication ) without lose asthma control.If hypothesis confirm , present study demonstrate asthma control maintain less half dose inhale corticosteroid less medical cost . Given aim study , population monitor include adult patient moderate persistent asthma , define control accord current guideline standard stabilise treatment . The intended treatment duration therefore design ensure good control asthma firmly achieve stepping treatment ( 8 week run-in period ) , also condition patient follow long enough ( 24 week comparative treatment period ) ensure new stable condition also obtain properly monitor .</brief_summary>
