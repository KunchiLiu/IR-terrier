SYNOPSIS BACKGROUND : The preferable treatment - whether revascularization conservative - asymptomatic high-risk patient &gt; 80 % internal carotid artery stenosis ( NASCET criterion ) currently unknown . STUDY HYPOTHESIS : We hypothesize protect carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) plus best medical treatment associate reduced rate ipsilateral neurological complication major adverse cardiac event high-risk patient asymptomatic &gt; 80 % internal carotid artery stenosis compare best medical treatment . STUDY DESIGN : The study design randomize control trial 1:1 random assignment two treatment modality include 300 patient within scheduled inclusion period 18 month . The primary secondary study endpoint evaluate initial two year follow-up period randomization . Secondary follow-up perform 1 , 1.5 , 3 , 5 10 year post randomization .</detailed_description>
