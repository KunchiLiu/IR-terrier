	<brief_title>Mirtazapine Reduce Methamphetamine Use Among MSM With High-risk HIV Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methamphetamine use especially prevalent among men sex men ( MSM ) . Population-based survey report methamphetamine use rate 20 time higher among MSM compare general population . Methamphetamine use also drive force MSM HIV epidemic : methamphetamine use associate increased number sexual partner , unprotected sex act , sexually transmit infection ( STI ) HIV acquisition . Despite alarm data , relatively intervention test among methamphetamine-using MSM , study test efficacy pharmacologic intervention reduce methamphetamine use population . In parallel continued test behavioral approach , believe time come test pharmacologic intervention reduce methamphetamine use among MSM . Pharmacologic approach treat substance use successful treating nicotine , alcohol , heroin dependence . No study test pharmacologic intervention reduce methamphetamine use among MSM high risk HIV acquisition transmission . A recent pilot study find mirtazapine , drug dual dopaminergic serotonergic property , significantly reduce methamphetamine withdrawal symptom compare placebo two-week period among Thai men drug probation center . Mirtazapine commonly use , FDA-approved antidepressant ; however , Thai study effect methamphetamine withdrawal independent effect depressive symptom , suggest direct effect mirtazapine treat methamphetamine dependence . We propose expand upon promise pilot result conduct study intermediate size ( 60 participant ) length ( 3 month follow-up ) ass efficacy mirtazapine reduce methamphetamine use among high-risk MSM . The specific aim study : 1 . To test hypothesis mirtazapine 30 mg daily reduce methamphetamine use significantly placebo among methamphetamine-dependent MSM , determine proportion methamphetamine-negative urines self-report methamphetamine use mirtazapine versus placebo group . 2 . To measure acceptability mirtazapine placebo among methamphetamine-dependent MSM , determine ( via electronic pill cap self-report ) medication adherence mirtazapine placebo . 3 . To measure safety tolerability mirtazapine placebo among methamphetamine-dependent MSM , determine number adverse clinical event mirtazapine placebo arm . If promising , study result use design phase III clinical trial determine mirtazapine 's effect reduce methamphetamine use lead reduction methamphetamine-associated sexual risk . We choose first conduct 3-year intermediate-sized trial order determine mirtazapine reduces methamphetamine use whether mirtazapine demonstrate good acceptability tolerability among population methamphetamine-associated high-risk sexual behavior . If prof case , believe study result provide strong support much large trial test hypothesis mirtazapine-driven reduction methamphetamine use result corresponding decrease sexual risk behavior . This study therefore design reflect structure large HIV-risk reduction trial include substance use sexual risk behavior measure . We enroll sexually active , methamphetamine-dependent MSM ( either HIV-negative HIV-positive ) randomize 1:1 receive mirtazapine placebo 90 day . Because medication approve treat methamphetamine dependence , include extensive safety parameter , require Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) test medication new indication new population . Participants see weekly urine drug test brief substance use counseling . All receive HIV risk-reduction counseling . Behavior assess use standardized measure via audio computer-assisted self-interview ( ACASI ) .</detailed_description>
