	<detailed_description>At present time , heart transplant recipient must take anti-rejection medication prevent rejection donate heart . Even medication , chronic rejection common cause late graft loss . The anti-rejection agent significantly toxic , side effect include kidney damage , infection increase incidence cancer . The goal study allow patient develop `` tolerance '' transplant heart maintain competent immune system . Tolerance enable transplant recipient 's body recognize transplanted organ self rather foreign tissue . The recipient try reject donor heart need anti-rejection medication could dramatically decrease eliminate entirely . To accomplish , patient study receive specially treat bone marrow take heart donor . Bone marrow transplant show animal study human induce tolerance follow organ transplant . Two factor limit application donor marrow transplant induce tolerance : 1 ) prepare patient transplant ( condition ) ; 2 ) graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Traditional conditioning destroy recipient 's immune system require marrow transplant successful patient unable fight infection donor cell survive . GVHD occur donor immune cell recognize recipient 's cell foreign tissue attack . Severe GVHD result death . This study utilize new approach conditioning leave patient 's immune system intact . The transplant product deplete GVHD-producing cell retain tolerance-promoting facilitating cell , intend ensure donor recipient cell coexist peacefully , state call mixed chimerism . The toxicity condition transplantation significantly reduce . In study , determine appropriate cell dose safely establish mixed chimerism follow partial condition heart transplant recipient . The study take gradual approach increase cell dose achieve mixed chimerism . We believe study provide breakthrough approach heart transplantation . Our goal evaluate potential safely establish mixed chimerism induce tolerance follow heart transplant reduce eliminate need anti-rejection therapy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject must age 18 70 year meet institution 's criterion cardiac transplantation . Subjects must acceptable negative result infectious disease marker do within two week bone marrow infusion . Subject receive first cardiac transplant . Subjects receive multiorgan transplant ( i.e. , heart/kidney ) may include discretion PI investigator . Note : These multiorgan subject identical criterion exception adequate function affect organ transplant ( i.e. , kidney ) . They include total thirty subject transplant . Subject 's panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) &lt; 40 . If patient plasmapheresed prior heart transplant , pretransplant PRA consideration inclusion/exclusion . Subject must negative crossmatch donor . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine test within 48 hour ) TBI agree use reliable contraception one year follow transplant . Subject able give inform consent . Clinically active bacterial , fungal , viral parasitic infection Pregnancy Previous radiation therapy dose would preclude TBI Subject unable give inform consent If procedure associate study ( i.e. , deliver TBI ) would significantly extend cold ischemia time heart , protocol abandon patient receive conventional heart transplant .</criteria>
