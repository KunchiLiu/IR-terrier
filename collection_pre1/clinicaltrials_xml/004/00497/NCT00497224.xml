	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Erlotinib Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib addition gemcitabine significantly improve overall survival compare gemcitabine alone advanced pancreatic cancer ( median overall survival 6.24 v 5.91 month respectively ) . However , combine therapy become standard care due modest absolute benefit . In NSCLC , optimal efficacy erlotinib combination first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy advance disease , single agent cytoxic chemotherapy . Preclinical clinical data suggest erlotinib activity single agent advance pancreatic cancer . The presence erlotinib-induced rash associate improved survival phase II III trial diverse tumor type ( review Perez-Soler et al . ) , associate high steady state concentration erlotinib . This phase II trial aim determine safety efficacy erlotinib patient advance pancreatic cancer previously treat one prior line gemcitabine base chemotherapy advanced disease . In addition , evaluate feasibility activity dose escalation erlotinib patient develop rash . Clinical outcome correlate EGFR status base immunohistochemistry gene amplification status well Kras mutation archival tumor tissue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm pancreatic carcinoma locally advance , unresectable metastatic . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Previous therapy : Surgery : Previous surgery permissible . Patients must &gt; 4 week major surgery . Chemotherapy : Patients may receive 1 prior line gemcitabine base systemic therapy ( single agent combination therapy ) locally advanced metastatic disease . Prior therapy inhibitor angiogenesis permit . All toxicity must resolve &lt; Grade 1 ( CTCAE v 3.0 ) last dose must give least 4 week prior randomization . Patients may also receive prior 5 FU ( +/ folinic acid ) gemcitabine give concurrently radiation `` radiation sensitizer '' . All toxicity must resolve last dose chemotherapy must give least 4 week prior randomization . Radiation : Patients may receive prior radiation treatment management local disease provide disease progression document ( either locally systemically ) , toxicities resolve , last fraction radiation treatment complete least 4 week prior randomization . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use erlotinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . Life expectancy great equal 3 month . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; /= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 1,000/mcL Platelets &gt; /= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 UNL AST ( SGOT ) &lt; /= 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal INR &lt; /= 1.5 unless warfarin ( see 3.1.9 ) Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance &gt; /= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Since CYP3A4 appear major enzyme responsible human hepatic metabolism erlotinib vitro , concurrent use inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 prohibit study treatment period . Concurrent use CYP3A4 substrates allow , however , use caution monitor patient potential drug interaction . There potential interaction erlotinib warfarin . Patients experience elevated INRs bleed combination drug . Patients warfarin PT INR &gt; 1.5 eligible provide follow criterion meet : The patient therapeutic stable dose warfarin The upper target INR great 3 . The patient active bleed pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g. , CT evidence tumor invade duodenum know varix ) . Note : anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin permit . The effect erlotinib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent concurrently ineligible . Prior therapy inhibitor EGFR ( eg . cetuximab , EMD 72000 , panitumumab , gefitinib , erlotinib ) multitargeted agent inhibit EGFR ( eg . ZD6474 , AEE788 ) . Patients allergies history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition erlotinib . Patients great grade 1 diarrhea baseline . Patients pancreatic cancer often diarrhea due pancreatic insufficiency , trial pancreatic enzyme may warrant reduce baseline diarrhea . PT INR &gt; 1.5 unless patient fulldose warfarin . Patients condition impairs ability swallow retain pill Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled hypertension , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study erlotinib potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother erlotinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated erlotinib . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction erlotinib . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
