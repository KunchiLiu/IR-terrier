	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic disease estimate affect 25 million people US Europe ( i.e . approximately 10 % total population ) .There evidence last 20 year prevalence considerably increase , especially among child . The diagnosis asthma child may difficult , largely episodic wheezing cough among common symptom encounter childhood illness , particularly child 3 year old.Although young child possibility treatment , episode wheezing may reduce intensity effective use anti-inflammatory medication bronchodilator rather antibiotic . At present , pharmacological therapy use treat reversible airway obstruction , inflammation hyperreactivity child adult . Medications include preventive treatment form antinflammatory/antiallergic agent ( e.g . glucocorticosteroids , leukotriene antagonist , cromolyn sodium ) reliever treatment , form bronchodilator ( e.g . β-adrenergic agonist , anticholinergic ) . Comparisons : Beclomethasone suspension nebulisation ( 400 mcg U.D.V . ) plus need salbutamol compare placebo plus need salbutamol need salbutamol/beclomethasone fix combination .</detailed_description>
