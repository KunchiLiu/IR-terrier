	<brief_title>Aripiprazole Treatment Methamphetamine Dependence Among High-risk Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Population-based survey estimate prevalence methamphetamine use 20 time higher among men sex men ( MSM ) compare general population . Methamphetamine-associated sexual risk behavior also drive force MSM HIV epidemic : methamphetamine use associate increased number sexual partner , unprotected sex act , sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) , HIV acquisition . Despite alarm data , relatively intervention test among methamphetamine-using MSM . Among heterosexual non-injection drug user , methamphetamine use associate well characterized risk HIV STDs include increased number sexual partner , less condom use non-methamphetamine user , engage sex work , self-reported history STDs . In parallel continued test behavioral approach , believe time come test feasibility acceptability pharmacologic intervention reduce methamphetamine use among high-risk individual . Pharmacologic approach treat substance use successful treating nicotine , alcohol , heroin dependency . Preliminary dose study demonstrate aripiprazole ( Abilify ) , FDA-approved , well-tolerated antipsychotic partial dopamine agonist , reduce effect methamphetamine human exhibit good safety profile . We propose expand upon promising result conduct randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study aripiprazole among sexually-active , methamphetamine-dependent individual . The specific aim study : 1 . To test hypothesis aripiprazole 20 mg daily reduce methamphetamine use significantly placebo among methamphetamine-dependent individual , determine proportion methamphetamine-negative urines self-report methamphetamine use aripiprazole versus placebo group . 2 . To measure acceptability aripiprazole placebo among methamphetamine-dependent individual , determine ( via electronic pill cap self-report ) medication adherence aripiprazole placebo . 3 . To measure safety tolerability aripiprazole placebo among methamphetamine-dependent individual , determine number adverse clinical event aripiprazole placebo arm . If promising , study result use design large , definitive clinical trial determine efficacy aripiprazole reduce methamphetamine use correspond methamphetamine-associated sexual risk among MSM . This pilot study therefore design reflect structure trial . We enroll 90 sexually active , methamphetamine-dependent individual randomize 1:1 receive aripiprazole ( n=45 ) placebo ( n=45 ) 12 week . Because test drug new indication new population , include extensive safety parameter , do prior study pharmacologic intervention among substance user . We also include urine test extensive behavioral risk assessment anticipate future definitive efficacy trial analyze substance use sexual risk behavior outcome . Study participant see San Francisco Department Public Health AIDS Office provide urines drug test participate substance use counseling . All participant receive HIV risk-reduction counseling . Behavior assess use standardized measure via audio computer-assisted self-interview ( ACASI ) .</detailed_description>
