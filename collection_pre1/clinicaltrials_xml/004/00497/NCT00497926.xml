	<brief_summary>Research study involve use combination Enriched Hematopoetic Stem Cell Infusion ( stem cell , produce bone marrow , generate cell form blood element , help fight infection assist clot ) kidney transplantation donor try avoid need long-term anti-rejection drug therapy . The desired result study allow body develop `` tolerance '' transplant kidney . Tolerance mean body would see transplanted kidney part try get rid , reject . To prevent rejection , drug call immunosuppressive agent must take daily basis . The purpose study determine procedure safe try substantially reduce even eliminate need anti-rejection medication .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must age 18 65 year meet institution 's criterion renal transplantation endorgan failure Meets transplant criterion study site recipient donor accept candidate standard care live kidney donation transplantation Patient receive renal transplant The crossmatch negative donor recipient . An initial crossmatch perform prior stem cell mobilization determine subject proceed pheresis . Potential recipient woman child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine test acceptable ) within 48 hour prior receive Granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF ) agree use reliable contraception 1 year follow FCRx infusion Potential donor woman child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine test acceptable ) within 48 hour prior receive GCSF No evidence donorspecific antibody presently historically Panel Reactive Antibody ( PRA ) less equal 20 Note : The subject need local resident order eligible trial , must willing reside area , within four hour drive , first month protocol monitor closely early post transplant period . As long insurance funding cover cost transplant research related complication , necessary subject US citizens participate trial . Clinically active bacterial , fungal , viral parasitic infection Pregnancy Clinical serologic evidence viral infection would preclude recipient receive kidney transplant FCRx infusion Previous radiation therapy dose would preclude Total Body Irradiation ( TBI ) Positive crossmatch donor recipient Evidence immunologic memory donor BMI &gt; 35 &lt; 18 Positive serology Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Insufficient fund bone marrow processing cost</criteria>
