	<brief_title>The Value Supervised Exercise Therapy After Invasive Treatment Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment peripheral arterial disease consist vascular risk factor management , dependent severity disease , exercise therapy , either radiological surgical intervention . After invasive treatment , many patient keep complaint , complaint return , despite fact treat segment still patent . Supervised exercise therapy ( SET ) prove effective treatment patient intermittent claudication , significant increase maximal walk distance . Further , exercise therapy contribute improvement quality life , delay disease progression improvement vascular risk profile . Research SET invasive intervention rare . In one study , effect SET surgical treatment walk distance determine . The initial claudication distance increase significantly exercise group , compare surgical treatment alone . In June 2004 , Network Exercise Therapy Parkstad ( NETP ) implement Heerlen environs . The physiotherapist network provide community base SET accord protocol Royal Dutch Society Physiotherapy . The web base database , part NETP , retrospectively search patient start SET within 2 month radiological surgical intervention . Seventeen patient fulfil criterion , 1 , 3 , 6 12 month , significant increase initial claudication distance ( ICD ) absolute claudication distance ( ACD ) . The expectation SET , immediately offer invasive intervention peripheral arterial disease , influence walk distance quality life . Further , positive influence vascular risk factor frequency re-interventions expect .</detailed_description>
