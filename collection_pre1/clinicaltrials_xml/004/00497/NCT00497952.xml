	<detailed_description>While cause MS know , autoimmune component destroy nerve cell . Autoimmunity condition individual 's immune system attack his/her cell . Bone marrow stem cell transplantation show halt autoimmunity . Stem cell transplant perform use patient 's cell , donor cell . The general consensus field donor transplant likely halt disease progression . This study design evaluate safety donor transplant procedure therapy relapse remit multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . Two factor limit widespread application traditional donor stem cell transplant : 1 ) prepare patient transplant ( condition ) ; 2 ) graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Traditional conditioning destroy recipient 's immune system require marrow transplant successful patient unable fight infection donor cell survive . GVHD occur donor immune cell recognize recipient 's cell foreign tissue attack . Severe GVHD result death . This study utilize new approach conditioning leave patient 's immune system intact . The transplant product deplete GVHD-producing cell retain tolerance-promoting cell , call facilitating cell , intend ensure donor recipient cell coexist peacefully . The toxicity condition transplantation significantly reduce . The end result marrow system contain recipient donor cell , state call mixed chimerism . In study , determine appropriate cell dose safely establish mixed chimerism follow partial condition patient RRMS . The study take gradual approach increase cell dose achieve mixed chimerism . Each patient receive cell dose one unit dose receive recent safely transplanted patient . We believe study provide breakthrough treatment MS . The goal study evaluate potential safely establish mixed chimerism interrupt autoimmune process end devastate effect MS .</detailed_description>
