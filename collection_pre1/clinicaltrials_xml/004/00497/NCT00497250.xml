	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate tolerability maximum tolerate dose Conformal Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy give combination gefitinib 250mg Chinese patient IIIB IV NSCLC failure platinum-based chemotherapy . Secondary objective study obtain preliminary information efficacy concomitant treatment gefitinib 250mg radiotherapy Chinese patient IIIB IV NSCLC failure platinum-based chemotherapy , measure RECIST criterion . To determine pattern failure ( e.g. , local , regional , distant metastasis ) patient treat regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laboratory research suggest target specific signalling protein would well suit selectively enhance tumor radiosensitivity . In human xenograft model ( non-small cell lung cancer breast cancer ) treat gefitinib irradiation , combine therapy show significant increase tumor growth delay compare monotherapy irradiation gefitinib . The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 selectively potentiate radiation response human tumor nude mouse , mark improvement therapeutic index . The author conclude gefitinib profoundly enhance antitumor action RT test tumor without significant adverse effect , increase therapeutic selectively ionize radiation certain model system . Substantial benefit multimodality therapy patient could expect . While publish data feasibility efficacy combine gefitinib radiation therapy Chinese population might susceptible gefitinib monotherapy , clinical study demonstrate combine gefitinib external beam radiation 66-74Gy concurrent weekly chemotherapy induction chemotherapy tolerate without excessive toxicity . In present trail , hope build experience use combine gefitinib thoracic radiation 3D-CRT intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) technique phase I set stage IIIb select stage IV NSCLC . We follow treatment ( RT gefitinib ) 60 day gefitinib standard systemic dos .</detailed_description>
