	<brief_summary>This study safety MSP 3 LSP candidate malaria vaccine child age 1-2 year Burkina Faso . Three imminizations 28 day interval administratered subcuteneously shoulder region . The study compare MSP3 Engerix B vaccine evaluate whether safe give child malaria endemic country . The study also evaluate whether vaccine induces expect immune response . Two dose level MSP 3 evaluate ; 15µg 30µg determine one best safety immune response profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase Ib Trial MSP 3 LSP 1-2 Year Old Children Burkina Faso</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single centre randomize control blind study ( observer blind ) . It conduct CNRFP Vaccinology unit locate Balonghin . Children catchments area within 1-2 year age group , whose parent consent screen randomise 45 eligible participant . Two MSP 3 dose level evaluate ; 15µg 30µg . The study start immunize old child low dose observe safety parameter closely , proceed high dose two week observation apart . Clinical , biological immune response data gather vaccination 15µg 30µg MSP 3 LSP compare : - The child 's baseline data vaccination , - The post vaccination data child control group . Randomization ensure comparison group similar relevant characteristic baseline . The concealment allocation enrolment enforce randomisation . Individuals make assessment study end point completely blind vaccine administer . This ensure observer bias . Further , report information bias minimise , recipient also aware vaccine administer . This possible select control vaccine routine use area , recommend Ministry Health . Cross immunisation end trial involve child receive study vaccine ; administer control vaccine interest public health benefit . The schedule vaccination 0 , 1 2 month adopt suitable target group . The idea eventually deploy vaccine expand programme immunisation vaccine become registered public use . For EPI age group , efficient delivery mechanism , also vulnerable group malaria . In brief , group allocate follow : - Group 1 : 23 participant ( 15 receive MSP-3 vaccine 15 µg 8 receiving Hepatitis B vaccine ) . - Group 2 : 22 participant ( 15 receive MSP-3 vaccine 30 µg 7 receiving Hepatitis B vaccine ) Immunization schedule 0 , 1 , 2 month cohort provisionally follow group : Study day 0 , 28 56 group 1 ; Study day 14 , 42 , 70 group 2 Vaccinations group 1 2 stagger : immunization group 2 start 2 week group 1 . This interval may extend deemed necessary due SAEs safety concerns.Randomization do group time first vaccinations.Route inoculation subcutaneous injection right leave deltoid ( alternately ) . Each child observe least 60 minute vaccination evaluate treat acute adverse event ( AEs ) . Study duration approximately 13 month per participant . There seven ( 7 ) day follow-up period solicit adverse event ( day vaccination plus 6 subsequent day ) ; twenty eight ( 28 ) day follow-up period unsolicited adverse event ( Vaccination day plus 27 subsequent day ) . The follow-up serious adverse event ( SAE 's ) 12 month follow first dose study vaccine ( 9 month dose 3 ) . At end follow-up period unsolicited AEs ( i.e. , one month third dose ) , participant follow field worker home monthly interval record SAEs . For data collection , conventional paper Case Report Forms ( triplicate copy ) use . An interim analysis foreseen day 84 follow . At stage decision consider whether proceed phase 2b study , dosage MSP 3 , base safety immunogenicity profile .</detailed_description>
