	<brief_title>Bone Marrow-derived Cells ' Contribution Tumor Formation Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent experimental study show circulate bone marrow-derived stem cell contribute formation cancer cell . However , clear whether applicable human being . In addition , bone marrow-derived cell consider play significant role regeneration inflame epithelial cell gastrointestinal tract graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , sometimes occur bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . On hand , well know incidence solid tumor significantly increase follow bone marrow transplantation . One purpose study determine role bone marrow-derived cell tumor formation acute chronic inflammation gastrointestinal tract human being , discover early cancer gastrointestinal tract subject receive BMT conduct surveillance detect second tumor , periodically . All subject patient receive allogeneic BMT Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital hematopoietic disorder . For determine role bone marrow-derived cell solid tumor inflammation like GVHD , suitable candidate female receive allogeneic BMT male donor , reliable marker bone marrow-derived cell identification Y chromosomes male donor tissue female . For early detection gastrointestinal cancer , subject confine patient without recurrence original disorder least 1 year BMT . They schedule undergo medical inspection use gastrointestinal endoscopy , periodically . When tumor lesion discover , biopsy specimen take proceed pathological examination . According result , patient proper treatment . The tissue specimens tumor inflammation female recipient male donor process Y fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis immunocytochemistry use monoclonal antibody cytokeratin , CD45 . Procedure First , inform consent study gain subject . Study 1 : determine role bone marrow-derived cell inflammation GVHD 1 . Subjects female recipient male donor . 2 . When symptom suggest acute chronic GVHD , gastrointestinal endoscopy conduct biopsy specimens take lesion definite diagnosis identification bone marrow-derived cell . 3 . Pathological investigation ( Y-FISH etc . ) conduct use tissue specimen . Study 2 : conduct surveillance second malignancy determine role bone marrow-derived cell formation tumor 1 . Subjects confine bone marrow recipient without recurrence original disorder least 1 year BMT . 2 . A medical inspection gastrointestinal tract perform use periodical endoscopy . 3 . The tissue tumor lesion discover take biopsy specimen process pathological examination . Regarding female recipient male donor , procedure study 1 take pathological study .</detailed_description>
