	<brief_summary>This study randomize , control trial examine effectiveness mechanical cough-assist device ( in-exsufflator ) promote clearance retain airway secretion patient symptomatic bronchiectasis . We hypothesize enhanced clearance airway secretion lead decline number acute exacerbation bronchiectasis experience patient study period , improve health-related quality life , decrease overall health-care cost improve pulmonary function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In-exsufflator Cough Assist Device Patients With Symptomatic Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis characterize airway dilatation potential cause devastate illness , include repeat respiratory infection require antibiotic , disable productive , mucopurulent cough , shortness breath occasional hemoptysis . The damage dilate airway lead persist bacterial infection bronchus bronchiole , cause inflammation retain secretion , turn may damage airway . Patients typically suffer frequent , severe refractory episode bacterial bronchitis , often require hospitalization prolong course antibiotic . The pathophysiology bronchiectasis involve retention viscid , tenacious inflammatory secretion microbes lead `` vicious cycle '' airway obstruction , destruction recurrent infection compromise mucociliary clearance host defense apparatus . It widely propose recommend method enhance clearance airway secretion integral component care patient bronchiectasis . Despite recommendation sound pathophysiologic plausibility give central role retention secretion play disease , effectiveness intervention target toward enhance bronchopulmonary hygiene systematically study . It also know whether ability generate adequate cough would predict patient benefit intervention . The mechanical in-exsufflator device assist patient clear retained secretion augment expiratory flow force patient 's cough addition cycle positive negative inspiratory pressure . An effective cough mechanism actually important beneficial host defense aid mucus clearance along mucociliary apparatus . We hypothesize daily , regular use in-exsufflator device lead reduction acute bronchiectasis exacerbations- clinically meaningful endpoint- possible beneficial outcome include improved pulmonary function , improve health-related quality life decrease health care cost . Despite lack rigorous , well-designed study support role effective mode bronchial hygiene physiotherapy patient bronchiectasis , many Pulmonologists recommend flutter valve device generally accept `` standard care '' time due relative non-invasiveness , ease use high level patient acceptability . The flutter valve simple , hand-held , pipe-like device help loosen secretion provide expiratory low-pressure vibratory pulse patient 's airway use . This study provide comparison clinical efficacy mechanical chest physiotherapy device set bronchiectasis .</detailed_description>
