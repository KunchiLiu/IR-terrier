	<brief_summary>The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) key regulator growth , differentiation , survival epithelial cancer . In small subset tumor , presence activate mutation within ATP bind site confers increase susceptibility gefitinib , potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor EGFR . Agents inhibit EGFR function different mechanism may enhance gefitinib activity patient lack mutation . Mevalonate metabolites play significant role function EGFR ; therefore , mevalonate pathway inhibitor may potentiate EGFR-targeted therapy . Targeting HMG-CoA reductase , rate-limiting enzyme mevalonate pathway , use lovastatin induces potent apoptosis variety tumor type . In vitro study , combine gefitinib lovastatin treatment show synergistic cytotoxic activity enhance inhibition AKT activation EGF NSCLC head &amp; neck cancer cell line . Therefore , investigator would like compare combination effect gefitinib simvastatin , specific protein inhibitor HMG-CoA reductase , gefitinib alone previously treat patient NSCLC .</brief_summary>
