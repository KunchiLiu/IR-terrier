	<brief_summary>A major complication diabetes mellitus diabetic nephropathy . In previous study investigator could demonstrate patient type 2 diabetes mellitus despite unaltered basal stimulate nitric oxide ( NO ) - activity , renal response antioxidant vitamin C pronounce compare control subject . These data suggest oxidative stress increase renal vasculature diabetic patient . Furthermore , NO-activity diabetic patient appear regulated compensate increase oxidative stress . This hypothesis support demonstration increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) expression kidney biopsy diabetic patient . Angiotensin receptor blocker find reduce oxidative stress various vascular bed . Some drug class , Telmisartan example , also exhibit partial agonist property PPARÎ³ receptor might great benefit patient diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome due additional improvement insulin resistance . Despite effect oxidative stress angiotensin receptor blocker beneficially alter renal haemodynamics reduce intraglomerular pressure thus protect glomerular injury . Recent advance magnetic resonance image lead development new technique allow separate measurement renal medullar cortical perfusion . This magnetic resonance imaging technique might useful tool detect alteration early level kidney patient high risk diabetic nephropathy . In current study , investigator want evaluate new magnetic resonance imaging technique measure medullar cortical renal perfusion pharmacological intervention telmisartan patient metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
