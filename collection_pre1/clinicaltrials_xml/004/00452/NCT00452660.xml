	<brief_summary>Certain percentage MDS patient develop iron overload . Iron known participate intracellular reaction generate free radical , induce oxidative stress apoptosis , find increase MDS patient consequently result ineffective hematopoiesis . The aim study evaluate antioxidant effect oral iron chelator Deferasirox -Exjade low risk MDS patient iron load evaluating change several oxidative stress parameter Certain percentage MDS patient develop iron overload .</brief_summary>
