	<brief_summary>Lymphoid follicle , consist T-and B cell , involve chronic inflammatory response COPD . Foxp3 positive regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) present follicle may involve suppression chronic inflammatory response . We hypothesise dysfunction Tregs underlies development inflammatory response COPD . This could either due decrease presence Tregs COPD , alter function Tregs possibly cause decreased HO-1 expression and/or alter TGFβ regulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>COPD lead cause death worldwide morbidity mortality still rising.So far , effective treatment available To find good treatment method insight need nature/origin chronic inflammation underlies development COPD . The important role neutrophil , macrophage cytotoxic T cell well establish respect , yet role CD4 T cell B cell recently ( ) attract attention . We detect presence lymphoid follicle lung tissue COPD patient , consist B cell surround T cell . Recently , find presence Foxp3 positive T cell component lymphoid follicle COPD . Since Foxp3 distinctive marker regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) , find suggests Tregs involve inflammatory response COPD . Tregs important control immunological tolerance prevent auto-immune response inhibit T-cell response . Dysfunction Tregs lead auto-immune disease , allergy chronic inflammatory disease . However , nothing know far contribution chronic inflammatory response COPD . Recent study show , next direct inhibition cell-cell contact , inhibitory effect Tregs mediate heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) expression membrane bound TGFβ . We hypothesise dysfunction regulatory T cell underlies development inflammatory response COPD . This could due decrease presence Tregs COPD , alter function Tregs . The latter may due decrease HO-1 expression , show macrophage COPD patient compare healthy control , and/or alter TGFβ regulation , cytokine play prime role COPD .</detailed_description>
