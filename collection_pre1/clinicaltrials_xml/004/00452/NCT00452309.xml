	<brief_title>Validation Correction Factor Measurement Accurate Ankle-Brachial Index Seated Position</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) highly prevalent medical condition . Patients PAD usually diagnose basis simple diagnostic procedure know ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) . The ABI ratio ankle pressure arm pressure measurement blood pressure arm legs use hand-held Doppler device . In order ABI measurement accurate , test conduct patient supine position . This eliminate influence hydrostatic pressure ankle toe lead falsely elevated reading . Unfortunately , many patient unable lie supine ABI measurement , include : wheel-chair bound , patient degenerative disease spine arthritis chronic back pain , patient advance cardiopulmonary disease orthopnea . Given importance detect PAD across broad spectrum patient , need identify mechanism reliable measurement ABI patient lie supine . The purpose study test correction factor effect hydrostatic pressure low extremity allow accurate ABI calculation seat position . 100 Subjects suspect arterial disease vascular lab enrol . Arm , ankle , toe pressure measurement make supine seat position . The seated ankle pressure correct hydrostatic pressure use mechanical formula . The ABI toe brachial index ( TBI ) calculate .</detailed_description>
