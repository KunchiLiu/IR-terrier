	<detailed_description>1.0 Objectives 1.1 Primary objective To investigate inversion sequence multi - phase , intensity - modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , treatment patient high - risk prostate cancer , improve delivery concurrent , weekly Docetaxel chemotherapy , concert long - term androgen deprivation ( LTAD ) . 1.2 Secondary objective To investigate inversion sequence multi - phase IMRT improve time grade 2 3 gastrointestinal toxicity , total amount Docetaxel deliver , quality life patient receive concurrent , weekly Docetaxel chemotherapy , concert long - term androgen deprivation ( LTAD ) . 2.0 Background 2.1 Rationale investigate chemo - radiation high - risk , non - metastatic prostate cancer Concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy , compare radiotherapy alone , result improvement overall survival cure patient locally advanced head neck , cervix , lung cancer . Long - term androgen deprivation ( LTAD ) radiotherapy result modest 10 year overall biochemical - free relapse rate patient `` High risk '' disease . Treatment intensification , form escalation radiotherapy dose , addition chemotherapy , addition radical prostatectomy , highly - select patient , propose literature , . Given success combine concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy solid tumor site , would seem reasonable investigate patient high - risk , non - metastatic prostate cancer , define Canadian consensus document , worst prognostic category . 2.2 Choice chemotherapy agent regimen The optimal chemotherapy combine radiation therapy unknown treatment prostate cancer . A recent phase III study , however , show superiority Docetaxel prednisone chemotherapy previous standard regimen , Mitoxantrone prednisone , men metastatic prostate cancer , demonstrate progression androgen deprivation . For first time , improvement overall median survival see regimen contain Docetaxel ( 18.9 vs 16.5 month , p = 0.009 ) , 48 % men 50 % great reduction PSA , improve HRQOL . Toxicity felt acceptable , main toxicity ( &gt; 30 % probability ) : fatigue , alopecia , nausea and/or vomiting , neutropenia , nail change , sensory neuropathy , diarrhea . The result study support similar phase III study show superiority Docetaxel , estramustine prednisone Mitoxantrone prednisone patient progressive , hormone - refractory prostate cancer . Literature review reveal one publish study concurrent Docetaxel chemotherapy external beam radiation . The study Kumar describe phase I , dose - escalation study design determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) weekly Docetaxel . The patient population include twenty - two patient localize , `` high risk '' prostate cancer , use modern external beam radiotherapy conventional dose 70.2 Gray 39 fraction , include treatment pelvic lymph node dose 45 Gray 25 fraction . They determine maximum weekly-tolerated dose Docetaxel 20 mg/m2 , dose level 25 mg/m2 , dose - limit toxicity grade 3 diarrhea ( use NCI common toxicity criterion , version 2.0 ) , occur 2 patient , necessitate 25 % dose reduction . In addition clinical feasibility , additional study suggest Docetaxel may reasonable agent study . There evidence vitro study Docetaxel increase radio - responsiveness 2.5 3 time , , . Docetaxel inhibit action Bcl-2 , phosphorylation serine residues Bcl-2 molecule , promote apoptosis via caspase cascade , pathway cell apoptosis also utilized ionizing radiation . Docetaxel also felt inhibit growth Bcl-2 negative tumor overexpression p27 , protein often lose androgen - insensitive prostate cancer cell . A comparison predictor radiation androgen therapy resistance , compare dominant target docetaxol also highlight docetaxol may ideal agent . A small study Rossner examine patient underwent salvage radical prostatectomy biochemical failure external beam radiotherapy . Fifty - five percent patient 's salvage radical prostatectomy specimen , show viable prostate cancer , demonstrate Bcl-2 overexpression , whereas comparison group underwent radical prostatectomy , match know prognostic factor , previous exposure radiation , detectable Bcl-2 overexpression . It would also appear Bcl-2 overexpression also prognostic recurrence radical prostatectomy . In study Stackhouse , patient whose radical prostatectomy specimen ' demonstrate Bcl-2 overexpression 27 % versus 69 % actuarial probability relapse - free survival 100 month , compare patient whose surgical specimen overexpress Bcl-2 ( Stackhouse 1999 ) . In summary , scientific rationale use concurrent Docetaxel include : providing biological dose enhancement tumor cell radio - sensitization , independent cell kill , aid destruction prostate cancer cell radio - resistant phenotype , help overcome cell androgen - insensitive phenotype . It anticipate sufficient drug deliver eradicate distant micro - metastasis , therefore intentionally target patient 'high - risk ' , high risk harbor distant micro - metastasis . In personal communication Dr. Ian Tannock ( email correspondence available request ) , support idea weekly , oppose every 3 weekly Docetaxel , intent enhance efficacy radiotherapy . The rationale utilizing weekly Docetaxel , side - effect profile , instead every 3 weekly Docetaxel , avoid hematological toxicity Myelosuppression every 3 weekly Docetaxel , weekly administration , myelosuppression see rarely ( &lt; 3 % ) , even heavily - pretreated patient metastatic , hormone - refractory prostate cancer8 . 2.3 Rationale radiotherapy sequence inversion The standard sequence radiation therapy portal use treat prostate cancer , treat large volume first , encompass regional lymphatics , well primary tumor site , treat prostate , local extension tumor may extraprostatic , usually small volume . The major reason address tumor , microscopic grossly evidence tumor , area harbour tumor - seed area irradiate , prevent progression tumor . In case prostate cancer , initial radiation portal encompass regional lymphatics prostate also encompass small bowel , large portion bladder bone marrow . Whereas IMRT reduce volume small bowel , bladder bone marrow high dose radiation volume , avoid organ completely . The small volume , treat prostate , completely avoid small bowel , largely treat patient full bladder , push small bowel away high dose radiation area . When small bowel , organ , completely avoided radiation , result side effect organ . By treat small volume first , avoids small bowel bone marrow , know toxicity Docetaxel cumulative , may possible deliver Docetaxel , full - dos , without delay , small bowel irradiated time initiation Docetaxel , oppose tradition sequence radiotherapy , small bowel irradiated time initiation Docetaxel . order large boost portal reverse , well , employ IMRT , sculpt radiation dose away small bowel , large field . The reason sequence inversion possible treatment prostate cancer , neo - adjuvant concurrent androgen deprivation result stasis prostate cancer cell radiation volume , virtually add risk prostate cancer cell migrate pelvic lymphatics prostate irradiate . 2.4 Overlapping treatment - related toxicity rationale sequence inversion The anticipate dose - limit acute toxicity , common modality , treatment - related diarrhea . A recent study Ashman retrospectively examine 27 patient underwent whole pelvic radiotherapy use 2D , 3D conformal technique IMRT . Overall , 9 patient ( 33 % ) experience acute Grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity , 1 patient treated IMRT . Antidiarrheal medication require 6 patient ( 22 % ) . However , 5 6 patient also receive chemotherapy ( either concurrent vinblastine/estramustine neoadjuvant carboplatin , estramustine paclitaxel , breakdown chemotherapy regiment specify publication ) , none treat IMRT . No Grade 3 high acute late GI toxicity observe . No case late radiation enteritis observe .</detailed_description>
