An upper limit forty year stipulate increase risk pregnancy affect chromosomal abnormality may result NTD , may similarly susceptible prevention nutrient supplementation . 3 . Cases previous affect child abnormality NTD , might suggestive another underlying genetic aetiology , chromosomal abnormality fetal valproate syndrome . In case underlie pathology would different spontaneous , isolated NTDs , folic acid inositol would expect influence recurrence risk . 4 . Women epileptic and/or take antiepileptic medication include valproate . It recognise antiepileptic drug increase predisposition NTDs , NTDs might unresponsive inositol supplementation . 5 . Women GP obstetrician UK . We need able monitor pregnancy , confirm contraindication inositol supplementation , seek outcome data . We facility seek information case outside UK . 6 .
