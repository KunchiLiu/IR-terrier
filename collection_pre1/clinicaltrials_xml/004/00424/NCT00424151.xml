	<detailed_description>Graves ' Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy autoimmune disease characterize inflammatory change periocular orbital region often association underlie thyroid abnormality . These change extremely debilitate may lead visual loss . Attempts limit reverse phenotypic expression Graves ' ophthalmopathy aggressive orbital decompression surgery target inflammatory disease , use high dose systemic corticosteroid and/or orbital radiotherapy , limited date treatment ineffectiveness co-morbidities . Selective B-cell depletion therapy offer potential treatment alternative . This study design treat patient Graves ' disease Rituximab attempt prevent reverse physically deform debilitate consequence disease .</detailed_description>
