	<brief_summary>This study conduct demonstrate non-inferiority two inhaled glucocorticosteroids long-acting bronchodilator combination drug call mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) fluticasone propionate/salmeterol dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) lung function . Information onset action , overall safety , drug control asthma also assess . The study approximately 1 year duration .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must diagnosis asthma least 12 month ' duration . A participant must use medium daily dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids ( alone combination longacting beta 2agonist [ LABA ] ) least 12 week must stable regimen least 2 week prior Screening . If inherent harm change participant 's current asthma therapy , participant must willing discontinue his/her prescribed inhale glucocorticosteroid ( ICS ) ICS/LABA prior initiate MF MDI runin medication . The diagnosis asthma must document either demonstrate increase absolute force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) least 12 % volume increase least 200 mL within approximately 15 20 minute administration 4 inhalation albuterol/salbutamol nebulized shortacting beta 2agonist ( SABA ) OR peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) variability 20 % OR diurnal variation PEF 20 % base difference prebronchodilator ( take albuterol/salbutamol ) morning value postbronchodilator value ( take albuterol/salbutamol ) evening , express percentage mean daily PEF value day openlabel Runin Period . A participant must history &gt; = 2 asthmarelated unscheduled visit physician emergency room within past year AND &gt; = 3 asthmarelated unscheduled visit within past 2 year . Prior randomization participant must use total 12 inhalation SABA rescue medication last 10 day runin . Clinical laboratory test ( complete blood count [ CBC ] , blood chemistry , include serum pregnancy female childbearing potential , urinalysis ) conduct Screening Visit must within normal limit clinically acceptable investigator/sponsor participant instruct start use openlabel MF MDI runin medication . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform Screening Visit , use centralize transtelephonic technology , must clinically acceptable investigator . A chest xray perform Screening Visit , within 12 month prior Screening Visit , must clinically acceptable investigator . A nonpregnant female participant childbearing potential must use medically acceptable , adequate form birth control . A female participant childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Screening order consider eligible enrollment . A participant demonstrate change absolute FEV1 &gt; 20 % time Screening Baseline Visits 2 consecutive day Screening Baseline visit . A participant require use great 8 inhalation per day SABA MDI 2 nebulized treatment per day 2.5 mg SABA 2 consecutive day Screening Baseline Visits . A participant experience decrease AM PM PEF Runin Period stability limit 2 consecutive day prior randomization . The average AM average PM PEF respective value precede 7 day add , divide number nonmissing value , multiply 0.70 determine stability limit . A participant experience clinical asthma exacerbation : defined clinical deterioration asthma judge clinical investigator Screening Baseline Visits , result emergency treatment , hospitalization due asthma , treatment additional , exclude asthma medication ( include oral systemic corticosteroid , allow SABA ) .</criteria>
