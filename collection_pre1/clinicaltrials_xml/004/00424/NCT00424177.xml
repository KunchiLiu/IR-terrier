	<criteria>Subjects eligible enrolment study must meet following criterion : Subject sign dated write inform consent . Adults ( ≥18 year ) diagnose chronic ITP accord American Society Hematology/British Committee Standards Hematology guideline , platelet count ≥20 Gi/L ≤50 Gi/L Day 1 ( within 24 hour prior dose Day 1 ) . In addition , peripheral blood smear support diagnosis ITP evidence cause thrombocytopenia ( e.g . pseudothrombocytopenia , myelodysplasia ) . The physical examination suggest disease may cause thrombocytopenia ITP . Subjects previously receive one prior ITP therapy . Previous treatment ITP include limited corticosteroid , immunoglobulin , azathioprine , danazol , cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab . Subjects must either initially respond ( platelet count &gt; 100 Gi/L ) previous ITP therapy bone marrow biopsy consistent ITP within 3 year rule myelodysplastic syndrome cause thrombocytopenia . It important clearly differentiate effect eltrombopag platelet count treatment effect prior concomitant ITP therapy . Therefore : 1 . Previous therapy ITP immunoglobulin ( IVIg antiD ) must complete least 1 week prior randomization platelet count must show clear downward trend last treatment immunoglobulin . Previous treatment ITP splenectomy , rituximab cyclophosphamide must complete least 4 week prior randomization , clearly ineffective . 2 . Subjects treat concomitant ITP medication ( e.g . corticosteroid azathioprine ) must receive dose stable least 4 week prior randomization . Subjects treat cyclosporine A , mycophenolate mofetil danazol must receive dose stable least 3 month prior randomization . Prothrombin time activate partial thromboplastin time must within 80 120 % normal range history hypercoagulable state . A complete blood count ( CBC ) , within reference range ( include differential indicative disorder ITP ) , follow exception : Platelet count ≥20 Gi/L ≤50 Gi/L Day 1 ( within 24 hour Day 1 ) require inclusion . Hemoglobin : Subjects hemoglobin level 10g/dL ( 100g/L ) low limit normal eligible inclusion , anemia clearly attributable ITP ( excessive blood loss ) . Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/mL ( 1.5 x 10^9/L ) require inclusion ( elevated White Blood Cells/ANC reference range due steroid treatment acceptable ) . The following clinical chemistry MUST NOT exceed normal reference range 20 % : creatinine , Alanine aminotransferase , Aspartate aminotransferase , total bilirubin , total albumin alkaline phosphatase . Subject practice acceptable method contraception ( documented chart ) . Female subject ( female partner male subject ) must either nonchildbearing potential ( hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation postmenopausal &gt; 1 year ) , childbearing potential use one follow acceptable method contraception two week prior administration study medication , throughout study , 28 day completion premature discontinuation study : Complete abstinence intercourse ; Intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; Two form barrier contraception ( diaphragm plus spermicide , male condom plus spermicide ) ; Male partner sterile prior entry study partner female ; Systemic contraceptive ( combine progesterone ) . Subject able understand comply protocol requirement instruction intend complete study plan . A subject NOT eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Any clinically relevant abnormality , ITP , identify screen examination medical condition circumstance , opinion investigator make subject unsuitable participation study suggest another primary diagnosis ( e.g. , thrombocytopenia secondary another disease ) . Concurrent malignant disease and/or history cancer treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Any prior history arterial venous thrombosis ( stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) , AND ≥ two follow risk factor : hormone replacement therapy , systemic contraception ( contain estrogen ) , smoke , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , medication hypertension , cancer , hereditary thrombophilic disorder ( e.g. , Factor V Leiden , Antithrombin III deficiency , etc ) , family history arterial venous thrombosis . Preexisting cardiovascular disease ( congestive heart failure , New York Heart Association Grade III/IV ) , arrhythmia know increase risk thromboembolic event ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) , subject QTc &gt; 450 msec . Female subject nurse pregnant ( positive serum urine bhuman chorionic gonadotrophin pregnancy test ) screen predose Day 1 . History alcohol/drug abuse . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication . Subject treat drug affect platelet function ( include limit aspirin , clopidogrel and/or Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs ) anticoagulants &gt; 3 consecutive day within 2 week study start end study . History platelet agglutination abnormality prevents reliable measurement platelet count . All subject secondary immune thrombocytopenia , include laboratory clinical evidence human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , chronic hepatitis B infection , hepatitis C virus infection , evidence active hepatitis time subject screening . If potential subject clinical history would support HIV infection hepatitis infection , laboratory screen necessary ; however , standard medical practice would suggest evaluation patient risk factor infection . Previous participation clinical study eltrombopag . Subjects plan cataract surgery . In France , subject neither affiliated beneficiary social security category .</criteria>
