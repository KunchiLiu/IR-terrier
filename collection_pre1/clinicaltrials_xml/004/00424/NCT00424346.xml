	<brief_summary>The 12-week core study design evaluate risk-benefit three subcutaneous dose regimen ACZ885 , add stable methotrexate ( MTX ) therapy ( great equal 7.5 mg/week ) , compare placebo patient active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The study investigate magnitude effect well onset effect different dose regimen . The primary objective extension study assess long-term safety tolerability canakinumab ( ACZ885 ) patient active RA . CACZ885A2201E1 evaluate objective patient participate core study ( CACZ885A2201 ) CACZ885A2201E2 patient complete first extension study .</brief_summary>
