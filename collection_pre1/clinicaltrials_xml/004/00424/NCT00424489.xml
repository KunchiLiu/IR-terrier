	<brief_summary>MG may neonatal , congenital , autoimmune . Neonatal MG arise transplacental transfer ACh receptor antibodies mother autoimmune MG fetus . Neonatal MG resolve post delivery clearance maternal antibody . Congenital MG result genetic defect ACh receptor . Patients congenital MG ACh receptor antibody . Both neonatal congenital MG exclude study . Autoimmune MG , common form MG , affect approximately 25,000 Americans . Like autoimmune disease , associate particular HLA genotype , female predominance , environmental factor involve break tolerance ACh receptor unknown . Patients refractory severe autoimmune MG consider candidate study . The purpose study assess toxicity/feasibility ( phase I ) autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation refractory myasthenia gravis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy Patients With Refractory Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There randomization study . All subject determine eligible study treatment receive high dose cyclophosphamide ATG follow infusion autologous peripheral blood stem cell . The procedure subject undergo follow : 1 . Physician visit determine potential eligibility study . Subjects evaluate transplant physician neurologist . They complete physical examination provide full medical history visit . The study describe detail transplant physician nurse consent form provide take home read . 2 . Insurance verification . Subjects remain interested pursuing study treatment refractory myasthenia gravis proceed insurance verification phase . Third party payment self-pay must verify subject proceed . 3 . Consent form . Prior proceeding , appropriate signature obtain consent form . Subjects give opportunity ask question attend physician transplant nurse prior sign consent form . 4 . Pre-transplant testing . To determine final eligibility study , subject undergo series tests/procedures . These include : CXR ; electrocardiogram ; MUGA echocardiogram ; pulmonary function test ; CT scan sinus ; CT scan chest r/o thymoma ; dental examination ; urinalysis ; blood test include CBC , chemistry , liver kidney function test , coagulation study , viral study , female , pregnancy test . All pre-transplant test routine medical test do verify diagnosis insure adequate organ function absence viral illness would preclude safe transplant course . 5 . Autologous peripheral blood stem cell collection . Subjects proceed transplant undergo routine procedure mobilization collection peripheral blood stem cell . This include administration IV cyclophosphamide , give inpatient require overnight stay , follow subcutaneous administration G-CSF , self-administered outpatient . Approximately ten day administration IV cyclophosphamide , peripheral blood stem cell collect outpatient Blood Center . A pheresis catheter place purpose first day leukopheresis . Leukopheresis continue daily basis adequate number peripheral blood stem cell collect ( maximum four leukophereses may perform ) . G-CSF continue administer leukopheresis complete . The pheresis catheter discontinue stem cell harvest complete . Processed cell frozen store reinfused conditioning regimen . 6 . PICC line placement . Subjects double lumen PICC line place prior administration study treatment administration chemotherapy , IV fluid , blood product withdrawal blood sample . The placement PICC line routine medical procedure . 7 . Study treatment . Subjects undergo condition include four day intravenous high dose cyclophosphamide three day intravenous anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) . Both cyclophosphamide ATG common immune suppressive agent . The previously collect peripheral blood stem cell reinfused follow completion condition regimen . 8 . Post-treatment follow-up . Subjects history physical transplant physician neurologist 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , yearly 5 year . In addition , routine urinalysis blood test performed interval include CBC , chemistry , kidney liver function test .</detailed_description>
