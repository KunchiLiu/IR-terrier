	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) important cause morbidity mortality organ transplant recipient . Management tuberculosis set challenge due complexity diagnosis potential toxicity anti-TB therapy , especially liver transplant candidate recipient . Although tuberculin skin test ( TST ) recommend screen latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) candidate liver transplantation , performance TST set less optimal , due lack specificity ( false-positive result due interaction BCG vaccine mycobacterial infection ) , lack sensitivity population relatively immunocompromised . Recently , new test name QuantiFERON-TB Gold ( QFT-G ) approve diagnosis LTBI . QFT-G detects release interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) sensitize white cell incubation whole blood TB antigens . QFT-G expect specific TST . However , study define performance QFT-G population patient wait list liver transplantation . We plan estimate usefulness QFT-G test diagnosis LTBI cohort patient end-stage liver disease . We hypothesize QFT-G test correlate well risk LTBI . This study advance research prevention serious bacterial infection devastate consequence post-transplant setting . The new diagnostic strategy may accurately determine presence LTBI , thereby allow appropriate therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Quantiferon®-TB GOLD ( Tube ) Assay With Tuberculin Skin Testing Detecting Latent Tuberculosis Infection Patients With Chronic Liver Disease Being Evaluated Awaiting Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Review record result test/procedures ( x-rays , CT-scans , etc . ) part subject 's clinical care result become part research record . In addition , laboratory result ( liver function test , chemistry , CBC diff , PT INR PTT ) collect medical record . - Record list medication subject take . Collect information demographic ( address , phone number , etc . ) include gender , race ethnicity . - Review record past medical social history The screening procedure take total 15-30 minute subject see Liver Transplant Clinic . The investigator research coordinator review subject 's medical record collect require information subject 's medical history . We ask subject , find medical record , past TB exposure treatment , overseas travel , current resident status ( long term care facility , home , hospital , etc . ) If subject qualifies research study subject undergo experimental procedure list . These procedure take place visit Liver Transplant Clinic . As part liver transplant evaluation subject blood withdrawn different type test . When blood obtain collect 3cc blood new TB testing . This collection blood sample occur subject get require pre transplant blood work need get stuck twice needle . The result research test available subject physician compare . The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold IT system use specialize blood collection tube , use collect whole blood . Incubation blood occur tube 16 24 hour , , plasma harvest test presence IFN-g produce response peptide antigens . The QFT-G ( IT ) assay perform accord manufacturer 's instruction ( Cellestis Ltd. ) . One mL whole blood place three separate test tube , one containing antigen ( nil control ) , one TB antigen ( ESAT-6 , CFP-10 TB7.7 ) one phytohemaglutinin ( mitogen positive control ) . The three tube incubate soon possible collection ( within 16hrs ) incubate 16 24 hour 37°C . Following incubation period , tube centrifuge . The plasma remove tube place plasma storage container . These container freeze future IFN-γ measurement ELISA . Each institution perform test point process . Each month , plasma sample post ice Edmonton Hospital Alberta , Canada . The sample batch undergo ELISA test process accord manufacturer 's instruction . A result ≥0.35 IU/mL TB antigen tube consider positive result . If level le mitogen control positive ( ≥ 0.5 IU/mL ) , negative result record . If level TB antigen mitogen tube less threshold positive , indeterminate ( anergic ) result record . The nil antigen tube adjust background IFN-γ level subtract IFN-γ level TB antigen mitogen tube . Once collect blood sample subject complete study .</detailed_description>
