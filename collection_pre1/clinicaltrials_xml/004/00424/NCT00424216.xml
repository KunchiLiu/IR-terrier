	<brief_summary>This study explore effect , , direct current ( DC ) brain polarization may produce mental process , attention , reaction time , work memory , speed information process mood emotional state . In DC brain polarization , weak electrical current apply head . This technique use many year patient healthy people know serious side effect . Studies show DC polarization temporarily improve people 's ability think certain word . To determine DC polarization use treatment certain type brain disorder , possible effect mood mental ability must determine . Healthy normal volunteer age 18 may eligible study . In three 1.5-hour session schedule day apart , participant complete task list determine effect polarization . For session , electrode place head , arm , hand . One set electrodes brain stimulation ; second set use measure amount skin moisture hand . The participant ' task : - Push button keyboard see specific item . - Circle number make mark line indicate much feel particular emotion sensation time . - Answer question , opinion certain topic . - Look several picture say emotional think . - Read imaginary situation say would situation . - Choose deck card try win money . - Compare angle line . - Identify smell , use scratch sniff test . - At end session , say feel . Participants call phone day session see feeling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The principal objective establish safety feasibility bilateral direct current ( DC ) polarization frontal lobe , may useful modality treatment frontal lobe cognitive behavioral deficit . Our secondary objective gather preliminary data whether DC modulate cognitive emotion-related function frontal lobe healthy individual . Study population : 25 healthy volunteer age 18 80 enrol . Design : The study double-blind crossover study three arm : anodal polarization , cathodal polarization , sham treatment . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure 1 ) cognitive function measure CalCAP battery 2 ) emotional state measure Profile Mood States . Secondary outcome measure include test emotion-based decision make social cognition .</detailed_description>
