	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( ^18FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT scan , may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study ^18FDG PET/CT scan see well predict response patient undergoing chemotherapy stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether metabolic response , define 25 % decrease peak tumor standardize uptake value ( SUV ) first course chemotherapy , provide early prediction treatment outcome ( tumor response patient survival ) patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer undergo platinum-based chemotherapy . - Determine test-retest reproducibility quantitative assessment tumor fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( ^18FDG ) uptake patient . - Determine time course treatment-induced change tumor ^18FDG uptake patient . - Determine , exploratory analysis , change tumor volume chemotherapy multislice CT scanning patient . OUTLINE : This prospective , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 3 group . - Group I : Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( ^18FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT scan twice 1-2 volumetric CT scanning ( 1-7 day apart ) start treatment platinum-based chemotherapy . Patients undergo additional ^18FDG PET/CT scan volumetric CT scan first second course chemotherapy . - Group II : Patients undergo ^18FDG PET/CT scan volumetric CT scan start treatment platinum-based chemotherapy . Patients undergo additional ^18FDG PET/CT scan volumetric CT scan first second course chemotherapy , may undergo second third course chemotherapy . - Group III : Patients undergo ^18FDG PET/CT scanning twice ( 1 week apart ) start treatment . In group I II , patient also undergo standard follow-up CT scanning every 6 week ( i.e. , every chemotherapy course ) 18 week . After completion chemotherapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year . Biomarker - Imaging : See - provide American College Radiology Network . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 285 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
