	<brief_summary>Glaucoma chronic disease define characteristic change optic nerve associate initially loss peripheral vision treat lower intraocular ( inside eye ) pressure . It report noticeable change optic nerve cause glaucoma may occur several year change vision notice . Since change optic nerve eye structure due glaucoma irreversible , important develop tool earliest possible detection change due glaucoma . The Heidelberg Retina Tomograph ( HRT ) device use produce three-dimensional map optic nerve retina , use detect change optic nerve retina time . In previous study , show useful detection change due glaucoma . However , HRT compare technique evaluate optic nerve stereophotography , find somewhat agree . The current study compare HRT stereophotography determine good one look document change optic nerve time due glaucoma . Using HRT initiate early topical medication change management require know well HRT result predict development visual loss . Accordingly , result study may affect management glaucoma patient optimize follow-up people condition initiate appropriate individualized treatment . Early treatment crucial prevent visual loss patient glaucoma ocular hypertension ( high pressure inside eye ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In glaucoma , treatment decision depend development morphologic functional damage . Therefore , damage serf indicator management . Commonly , progression determine various perimetric technique . However , report clinically detectable glaucomatous structural alteration ONH may precede development reproducible white white blue yellow visual field defect several year . The HRT confocal scan laser tomography device create three-dimensional topographic analysis ONH peripapillary retina include statistical analysis evaluate structural change time . This technique show good sensitivity high specificity detect glaucoma progression test use computer simulation . The good result obtain author , another study , small subgroup 16 patient monitor glaucomatous progression HRT ONH stereophotographs approximately 5.5 year . However , recent retrospective study , result demonstrate fair agreement HRT clinical judgment ONH stereophotographs progression glaucoma , mean follow-up time HRT 2.62 year . Although , evaluation ONH stereophotographs necessarily subjective , widely accept show effective evaluate change . Using stereophotographs assessment `` reference standard '' , HRT sensitivity 78 % specificity 70 % . The positive predictive value HRT 47.8 % , negative predictive value 90.3 % . According result study frequency true positive false positive change long follow-up , treatment decision would base test may error 52.2 % time . Accordingly , previous - study - study demonstrate fair agreement HRT clinical judgment ONH stereophotographs progression glaucoma . At present , available evidence appear sufficient show addition HRT improve ability predict development clinical optic disc change and/or visual field loss . Therefore aim current study investigate clinical significance HRT monitoring glaucoma progression . In word investigate well HRT result glaucomatous progression able predict future development optic disc and/or visual field change patient OHT glaucoma .</detailed_description>
