	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Sodium Bicarbonate Prevent Contrast-Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use contrast medium frequent new diagnostic therapeutic procedure develop . As consequence , occurrence acute renal failure ( ARF ) , also know contrast-induced nephropathy , frequently see realization procedure , represent 10 % in-hospital ARF . The importance prevent complication relate strong association high morbidity mortality rate patient present . A number drug intervention study prevent contrast-induced nephropathy , include intravenous hydration normal hypotonic saline solution , oral hydration , mannitol , diuretic , dopamine antagonist ( fenoldopam ) , calcium antagonist , theophylline , N-acetylcysteine , natriuretic atrial peptide hemodialysis contrast medium administration . There one study human demonstrate utility sodium bicarbonate prevent contrast-induced nephropathy , show reduction incidence complication 13.6 % . Although result could seem convince , relevance question definition use author contrast-induced nephropathy increase 25 % basal creatinine . Although compare , absolute difference basal after-procedure creatinines statistically significative , sample size small participant low-risk patient develop contrast-induced nephropathy . It also important note control group hydrate dextrose 5 % solution 154 mEq NaCl , although today â€™ accept prevention therapy intravenous hydration normal saline solution . Comparison : Hydration previously , afterwards contrast medium administration normal saline solution ( 0.9 % ) , compare hydration previous , afterwards contrast medium administration solution make normal saline sodium bicarbonate .</detailed_description>
