	<brief_title>Assessment Bypass Surgery Balloon Angioplasty Effects Peripheral Arterial Disease Using Contrast Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging ( CUPI ) develop University Hospital Freiburg , Germany 2005 assessment skeletal muscle perfusion deficits peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . It report previously investigator contrast agent wash-in significantly prolong PAD respect extent disease respect degree collateralization . The goal study examine effect revascularization procedure muscular perfusion 15 PAD patient undergo low limb artery bypass surgery 15 PAD patient undergo percutaneous angioplasty ( PTA ) intervention . Based data pilot study , power calculation alpha = 5 % power 80 % assumed standard deviation 10 yield necessary patient number 29 per group detect decrease wash-in time 7.5 s. In intra-individual comparison aim compare 30 patient pre 30 patient post revascularization . We hypothesize 1 ) contrast agent wash-in target muscle significantly improve revascularization 2 ) standard non-invasive test ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) correlate CUPI finding . The result trial help understand diagnostic accuracy CUPI quantify limb muscle perfusion deficit . Patients symptomatic PAD indication revascularization undergo CUPI le 8 week prior less 3 week revascularization procedure . A second follow-up CUPI examination perform 3 - 6 month revascularization procedure .</detailed_description>
