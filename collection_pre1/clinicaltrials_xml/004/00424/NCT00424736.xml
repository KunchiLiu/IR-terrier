	<brief_title>Role Total Body Imaging Asymptomatic Pediatric Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Negative physical examination alone show unreliable exclude intra-abdominal injury adult patient multitrauma . Therefore , management patient normal clinical examination blunt trauma subject controversy . Since 1970s , computer tomography ( CT ) become mainstay evaluate hemodynamically stable trauma patient . It 's generally accept hemodynamically stable patient abnormal abdominal examination result require use CT well patient depress level consciousness . Controversy exist awake , clinically evaluable patient obvious sign abdominal chest trauma . In last year number study express CT role evaluation asymptomatic trauma patient mechanism injury support probability internal organ injury . Those study show large number patient management change accord CT result . The author recommend liberal use CT trauma patient population . All study perform adult trauma patient . The purpose study evaluate role whole body image pediatric patient suspicious mechanism injury , hemodynamically stable obvious sign chest abdominal injury . The incidence injury patient population well change treatment base result CT examine . Methods The prospective observational study perform Assaf Harofeh Medical Center . All patient 15 year old blunt mechanism multisystem trauma eligible enrollment study . Only patient whose parent sing inform consent enrolled.Inclusion criterion base mechanism injury : 1. visible injury chest abdomen2 . hemodynamically stable3 . normal abdominal examination neurologically intact patient unevaluable abdominal examination patient depress level consciousness . 4. significant mechanism injury follow a. high speed ( 55km/hr ) motor vehicle accident b. fall great 3 meter c. automobile hit pedestrian d. assault depressed level consciousness All patient undergo CT head , chest , abdomen pelvis part evaluation . CT scan perform Emergency Department short patient 's admission clinical evaluation . An abnormal CT define exhibit traumatic abnormality . Patient treatment plan change define alteration management base directly CT findings.Data regard patient demographic , mechanism injury , physical examination finding , Glasgow Coma Score emergency department admission , Injury Severity Score , radiologic interpretation chest pelvic roentgenogram , injury require operative procedure , laboratory data , CT scan finding , change management plan base CT finding record .</detailed_description>
