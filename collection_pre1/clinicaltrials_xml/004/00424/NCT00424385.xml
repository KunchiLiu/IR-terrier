	<brief_summary>Eligible patient enrol one 4 cohort cohort allow 3 patient study . Patients receive study drug escalate dose schedule maximum 400 mg PO BID reach drug toxicity establish . Once pre-specified 400 mg mouth two time day ( PO BID ) dose drug reach without toxicity , study close accrual . If toxicity note prior reach 400 mg PO BID dosing , dose schedule deem safe per study design one use future phase II study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combining Imatinib Mesylate ( Gleevec ) With Sorafenib Patients With Androgen-independent Prostate Cancer ( AIPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gleevec Sorafenib modest efficacy androgen-independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) fact agent give orally appear tolerable side effect , hypothesize combine agent may provide patient another effective regimen disease therapeutic option limit . This study design investigate safety combine Gleevec Sorafenib well feasibility AIPC patient fail one line systemic chemotherapy . Once safety establish , follow-up phase II study commence investigate efficacy .</detailed_description>
