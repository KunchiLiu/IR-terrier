	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate efficacy Glucarpidase ( Voraxaze ) increase rate methotrexate ( MTX ) clearance follow high dose MTX treatment patient delay MTX clearance . 2 . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Glucarpidase follow high dose MTX treatment patient delay MTX clearance . 3 . To evaluate safety profile Glucarpidase follow high dose MTX treatment patient delay MTX clearance . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate effect Glucarpidase incidence neutropenic fever use intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic . 2 . To evaluate effect Glucarpidase length hospitalization . 3 . To evaluate effect Glucarpidase renal function . 4 . To evaluate effect Glucarpidase Quality Life ( QOL ) . 5 . To evaluate anti-glucarpidase antibody response . 6 . To evaluate efficacy Glucarpidase follow use repeat cycle high dose MTX treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Researchers want learn glucarpidase may impact patient ' length stay hospital , kidney function , quality life . Also , researcher want learn glucarpidase may decrease incidence neutropenic fever , may decrease use antibiotic vein treat kind fever . MTX high-dose chemotherapy drug reduces supply important vitamin ( folate ) require growth cancer cell . In patient delayed clearance MTX body , risk frequent severe side effect drug . Glucarpidase drug break MTX blood , cause drug less toxic decreasing level drug blood . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( temperature , pulse , breathe rate , blood pressure ) . You blood draw ( 3 teaspoon ) routine test . You also blood drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) , right treatment start , 28 day first dose study drug cycle , end study see antibody ( protein body help fight infection foreign substance body ) study drug . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . The blood use pregnancy test come sample take routine test . ( There additional blood draw pregnancy test ) . You may give either glucarpidase placebo ( drug look like glucarpidase active ) . Neither study doctor know give glucarpidase placebo . This call blind phase study . Before begin study , already suffer side effect ( difficulty MTX clearance ) , kidney toxicity , severe mucositis ( redness painful ulcer mouth ) , and/or extremely high MTX level , randomize receive glucarpidase , placebo . If case , doctor know give glucarpidase . If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 treatment group , base dose MTX receive . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . Participants one group receive glucarpidase . Participants group receive placebo . There high chance may receive glucarpidase placebo every patient receive placebo , 2 patient receive glucarpidase . The glucarpidase placebo dose may receive give vein within 12 hour find eligible participate study . Glucarpidase placebo give first study cycle ( MTX treatment complete , 72 hour MTX level find high ) . You may receive additional dos glucarpidase ( depend upon level MTX blood ) maximum 2 dos . If case , second dose give least 24 hour first dose receive . Regardless treatment group assign , continue receive standard treatment ( fluids vein sodium acetate sodium bicarbonate leucovorin ) high MTX level . In future cycle MTX , may receive glucarpidase , continue experience delay MTX clearing body . The glucarpidase dose may repeat maximum 2 time give cycle chemotherapy . The length cycle chemotherapy vary , depend dose MTX regimen patient receive . One cycle treatment glucarpidase least 24 hour apart . You ask fill several questionnaire regard quality life . These questionnaire ask level pain , fatigue , nausea , sleep disturbance , etc . They give first study cycle ( study drug give daily first study cycle ) . They take 5 minute complete time . You also blood drawn ( 3 teaspoon ) , different time , study doctor monitor kidney function liver function , depend clinical condition . These blood sample draw least twice week study . You blood draw presence antibody 14 day treatment glucarpidase , every cycle MTX treatment , end study . You take study disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , complete planned therapy ( maximum 6 cycle study drug ) . At end study , complete medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You also blood drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) routine test . This investigational study . Glucarpidase FDA approve commercially available . The M. D. Anderson Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) authorize use glucarpidase research . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . Glucarpidase placebo provide free charge study . Up 46 patient take part study . All patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients solid tumor hematologic malignancy , receive high dose methotrexate ( MTX ) ( &gt; / = 1 g/m^2 14 g/m^2 ) , delay MTX clearance . Delayed MTX clearance define : ) Serum MTX level 72 +/ 2 hrs initiation infusion &gt; / = 0.1 µmol/L MTX dose 13.5 g/m^2 OR b ) Serum MTX level 72 +/ 2 hrs initiation infusion &gt; / = 0.3 µmol/L MTX dose &gt; 3.5 g/m^2 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 3 . IRBapproved sign informed consent 1 . Any medical psychiatric illness deem investigator likely interfere patient 's ability sign inform consent , cooperate participate study 2 . Patients receive medication may interfere MTX excretion enhance MTX toxicity ( e.g . Penicillins , Cephalosporins , Tetracyclines , NonSteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents , Salicylates , Thiazide Diuretics , Bactrim , Probenecid ) 3 . Patients uncontrolled cardiac disease uncontrolled angina , cardiac arrhythmia , Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) ( New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) 4 ) 4 . Patients know hypersensitivity component study drug</criteria>
