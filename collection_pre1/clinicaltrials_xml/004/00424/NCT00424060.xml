	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , epothilone ZK-219477 , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well epothilone ZK-219477 work treat patient recurrent glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epothilone ZK-219477 Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess therapeutic activity epothilone ZK-219477 patient recurrent glioblastoma . Secondary - Determine safety profile , mechanism action , pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Gather information biological characteristic patient ' tumor may provide information response resistance drug . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive epothilone ZK-219477 IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline biomarker analysis comparison genetic alteration tumor tissue germline DNA . Blood sample also collect periodically course 1 pharmacokinetic study . Tumor tissue obtain diagnosis , possibly recurrence , use immunohistochemical analysis biomarkers . Fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) use detect genetic alteration gene expression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
