	<brief_title>A Trial Chemo &amp; Radiation Therapy Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , combination study cetuximab , gemcitabine , 5-FU , external beam radiotherapy patient locally advanced , non-metastatic pancreatic cancer . All patient assess history physical examination include weight , vital sign , performance status within 14 day initiation therapy . Baseline hematologic biochemical profile , include CBC differential , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin , SGOT ( AST ) , BUN , creatinine , CA 19-9 complete within 14 day initiation therapy . During cycle I ( chemoradiation ) , gemcitabine ( 200 mg/m2 ) cetuximab 400mg/m2 initial dose follow 250mg/m2 IV weekly give continuous infusion 5-FU ( 200 mg/m2/day ) deliver 5 every 7 day concurrent external beam radiation therapy . Cetuximab , gemcitabine 5-FU begin first week external beam radiotherapy continue throughout course external beam radiation therapy , discontinue follow conclusion external beam radiation therapy . All patient central venous access device place facilitate chemotherapy administration . During cycle 2 5 ( chemotherapy ) , gemcitabine administer dose 1000 mg/m2 30 minute follow cetuximab dose 250mg/m2 30 minute weekly 3 week follow one-week rest four cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological confirmation pancreatic adenocarcinoma require . Only patient unresectable , nonmetastatic tumor eligible . Documentation disease extent endoscopic ultrasound either laparotomy laparoscopy must perform within 42 day registration . All patient also assess chest xray abdominalpelvic CT scan . Confirmation palliative surgical bypass time laparotomy whether biliary stent place request . Disease must locoregional amenable surgery base one follow criterion : size pancreatic tumor &gt; 5 cm . lymph node ( bulky , &gt; 2 cm , within radiation port ) vascular involvement impingement major vessel ( superior mesenteric artery , superior mesenteric vein , portal vein , hepatic artery ) . invasion adjacent structure . Patients either measurable evaluable disease eligible . Patients evidence peritoneal seed malignancy eligible study . Patients evidence metastatic disease eligible . Patients concurrent malignancy site , except limited basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix , ineligible . Patients malignancy within 5 year study entry , except curatively treat basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix , ineligible . Patients may prior therapy carcinoma pancreas , prior abdominal radiation therapy . Age &gt; 18 year . CTC performance status &lt; 2 . No myocardial infarction past six month . No major surgery past two week . No uncontrolled serious medical psychiatric illness . Required Initial Laboratory Data : Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl AST &lt; 3x upper limit normal . Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl WBC &gt; 3,000/mm3 ( ANC &gt; 1500/mm3 ) Platelets &gt; 100,000 mm3 CA 199 Required Diagnostic procedure : Chest Xray Abdominal pelvic CT scan EUS Staging laparoscopy stag laparotomy Enrollment trial limit patient protocol therapy safe appropriate . Physicians consider risk benefit therapy together relevant medical consideration decide whether protocol appropriate particular patient . Specific consideration include : Psychiatric illness would prevent patient give informed consent . Serious medical illness uncontrolled infection , severe cardiovascular disease include recent ( &lt; 6 month ) myocardial infarction uncontrolled congestive heart failure , serious illness would limit anticipated survival &lt; 12 week . Protocol treatment would pose significant risk unborn child . Pregnant woman enrol , woman childbearing age strongly encourage practice effective birth control three month trial . Inability swallow medication . Patients adequate , unassisted oral intake .</criteria>
