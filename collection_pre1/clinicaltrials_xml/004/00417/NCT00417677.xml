	<brief_title>A Study Combining Treatment With Temsirolimus Sunitinib Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study determine safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination temsirolimus sunitinib subject advance Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) ( dose escalation phase ) . Once MTD determine , study also evaluate efficacy combination determine progression free survivial ( PFS ) 12 month subject advance RCC ( expand cohort phase ) .</detailed_description>
