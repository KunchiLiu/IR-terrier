	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine sensitivity optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) test detect neovascular AMD eye high risk CNV development . In order test hypothesis , conduct multi-center clinical study four participate clinical center . A total 227 participant enrol . Participants followed-up period two year , CNV develop study eye treatment recommend , determine occurrence CNV . The fundamental design principle study simplicity parsimony .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : The purpose study determine sensitivity OCT detect conversion neovascular AMD two year eyes high risk CNV , FA serve gold standard . Secondary Objectives : - To determine specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value OCT detect conversion neovascular AMD two year eyes high risk CNV , FA serve gold standard . - To compare sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value OCT PHP supervise Amsler Grid subject either negative PHP and/or negative supervise Amsler grid baseline detection neovascular AMD two year eyes high risk CNV - To describe feature false positive false negative respect baseline characteristic see PHP test , supervise Amsler grid testing , OCT image - To describe relationship new visual symptom experience participant prompt interim evaluation treatment CNV recommend finding see previous study visit ( PHP testing , supervise Amsler grid testing , OCT imaging , finding exam , fluorescein angiography ) well finding baseline visit - To determine physician 's detection CNV development return study visit include slit lamp biomicroscopy view ancillary test visit ( supervise Amsler grid , PHP , OCT , fundus photograph , fluorescein angiogram ) All participant examine upon enrollment follow every three month enrollment two year conversion CNV positive treatment recommend . Specifically , follow-up visit occur 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 month date Initial Visit .</detailed_description>
