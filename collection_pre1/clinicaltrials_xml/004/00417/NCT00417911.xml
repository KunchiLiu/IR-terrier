	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma malignant incurable hematological disease survival significantly improve high-dose melphalan autologous stem cell support ( ASCT ) young patient . However , disease eventually relapse new treatment demand . Bortezomib newly approve drug treat relapse multiple myeloma . It different biological effect response even patient refractory conventional chemotherapy . The purpose study randomize design investigate addition bortezomib 20 injection 4 month period start 3 month ASCT prolong time progression compare patient receive consolidation maintenance therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Bortezomib Consolidation After High-dose Melphalan With Stem Cell Support Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : ASCT prolongs EFS OS myeloma patient &lt; 65 year age . During period ASCT progression myeloma patient experience symptom good quality life11 . A prolongation EFS would big step forward myeloma treatment . Bortezomib new promising agent , show clear anti-myeloma effect heavily pre-treated patient . After ASCT tumour cell burden low hypothesis clinical trial unique mechanism action bortezomib may reduce number tumour cell even prolong EFS . Primary objective : * Evaluate effect EFS ( event define either progression death cause without precede progression ) consolidation treatment bortezomib ASCT compare consolidation Secondary objective : - Overall survival ASCT - Overall survival start relapse treatment - Time need relapse treatment - Response rate patient CR follow ASCT - Toxicity consolidation treatment - Quality life - Cost utility - Planned subgroup analysis : comparison primary secondary endpoint patient receive one vs. two high dose treatment</detailed_description>
