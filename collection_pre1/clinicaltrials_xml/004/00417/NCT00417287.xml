	<brief_title>Phase II Study PX-12 Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase I trial , PX-12 demonstrate anti-tumor activity pharmacodynamic activity across wide dose range . At high dos , one side effect agent garlic-like odor expire metabolite . This study conduct evaluate clinical efficacy , biologic activity ( inhibition PX-12 target thioredoxin-1 ) effect expire metabolite two dose level PX-12 . This study determine efficacy biologic activity achieve either two dose level sufficient proceed study without push maximally tolerate dose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis advance carcinoma pancreas ( stage IV disease ) . Patients whose tumor progress gemcitabine gemcitabinecontaining combination . Patients must receive two prior regimen metastatic disease . Use gemcitabine radiation sensitizer combination radiotherapy localize disease consider prior gemcitabinecontaining regimen gemcitabine receive ≤ 1 month follow completion radiotherapy . In addition , use 5fluorouracil radiation sensitizer localize disease allow count prior regimen 5FU continue ≤ 1month follow completion radiotherapy . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70 % . Patients must discontinue previous anticancer therapy investigational agent least three week within 5 half life drug ( whichever short ) prior entry study ( six week mitomycin C nitrosureas ) provide toxicity prior treatment resolve Grade 1 less . Patients must discontinue radiation therapy least two week prior entry study recover radiationrelated toxicity . Adequate organ function include follow : ANC ≥ 1500 cells/microL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/microL ; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( may transfuse level ) . Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ; aspartate transaminase ( AST/SGOT ) alanine transaminase ( ALT/SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR &lt; 5 time institutional ULN subject document liver metastasis . Creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL . CA199 level &gt; 2 time ULN . Disease measurable CT scan per RECIST criterion ( Appendix IV ) . PET/CT PET scan SUV ≥ 5.0 least one lesion 18F FDG scan . Active infection require antibiotic study entry . Any serious concomitant systemic disorder opinion investigator would place patient excessive unacceptable risk toxicity . Patients active ( require continuous medical therapy ) pulmonary disease ( COPD , asthma ) evidence interstitial pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis baseline chest Xray PET/CT scan . Significant central nervous system psychiatric disorder ( ) preclude ability patient provide inform consent . Known suspected brain metastasis receive adequate therapy . Patients must stable without requirement steroid seizure medication . Major surgery within 4 week study entry . Chemotherapy/investigational drug within 3 week within 5 half life drug ( whichever short ) study entry , provide toxicity prior treatment resolve Grade 1 less . Inability tolerate prophylactic ( 1 mg/day ) coumadin .</criteria>
