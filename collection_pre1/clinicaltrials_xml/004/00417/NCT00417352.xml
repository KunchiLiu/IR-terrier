	<detailed_description>PROBLEM STATEMENT : Current improvement design upper limb prosthesis include advanced technology control system electronic circuitry mimic human motion improve function prosthesis . Often time improvement require large amount power , circuitry excess mass distally along prosthesis may require great effort user . Poor function upper limb prosthesis may cause awkward compensatory motion . Aberrant movement , compensatory movement know cause great stress remain joint . Amputees force decide extra function provide advanced electronics worth carry extra mass may cause fatigue , socket issue great stress remain joint . An example wrist rotator component upper limb prosthesis may allow great function reduce compensatory motion , add mass distally , potentially cause great torque remain joint . SYNOPSIS OF CURRENT LITERATURE : Restricted motion excess weight upper limb prosthesis document complaint among amputee [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . Through survey Atkins et al . determine amputee would like wrist component prosthesis perform movement . This study also list drink glass opening door , top priority among amputee [ 7 ] . This suggest wrist component prosthetic arm important . There many example throughout scientific literature show kinetic , kinematic metabolic analysis gait lead improvement low limb prosthetic design criterion [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] . In 2003 , Twiste et al . conduct literature review rotation translation anatomic joint prosthetic gait . The abstract review mention accurate kinematic gait analysis show optimized gait pattern could help manufacturer design prosthetic component mimic pattern [ 9 ] . The effect mass perturbation low limb amputee investigate determine inertial property prosthesis evaluate [ 10 ] . There also study involve upper limb motion , amount limit . The range motion upper limb healthy brace subject perform activity daily live record analyzed [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . These study look effect wrist position , mass wrist component . GOALS OF THE STUDY : There two main goal study : 1. determine impact upper limb prosthesis without wrist rotator compensatory motion torque remain joint common task 2. determine impact location ( distally proximally ) wrist rotator upper limb prosthesis compensatory motion common task HYPOTHESES : 1 . There statistically significant difference range motion upper limb joint healthy subject , brace subject upper limb amputee four common task . 2 . There statistically significant difference joint upper limb joint torque healthy subject , brace subject upper limb amputee three common task . 3 . There statistically significant difference upper limb angle joint torque mass add distally mass add proximally common task . METHODS Participants Ten healthy adult volunteer history upper limb injury participate study . Five men five woman participate . These ten subject make control group brace simulate elbow prosthesis . Seven unilateral upper limb amputee participate . Testing Protocol An 8 camera infrared Vicon motion analysis system use collection analysis movement data . Nineteen spherical reflective marker place boney landmark upper limb torso subject describe segment local coordinate system . A static trial collect subject help determine joint center . Subject parameter body mass , height , shoulder depth , wrist hand thickness collect use calculation . Kinematic data collect 120 Hz . Subjects ask complete four task : - Drinking cup - Opening door - Lifting 5 lb . box - Turning steer wheel ( kinetic analysis task exclude ) The healthy subject complete task follow intervention : ( 1 ) intervention ( 2 ) brace restrict forearm wrist motion , ( 3 ) brace 96 g ( mass average prosthetic wrist rotator ) add near elbow , ( 4 ) brace 96 g add near wrist . The amputee complete intervention ( 3 ) ( 4 ) mention without wrist rotator simulate mass one . Three trial collect experimental test condition trial average representative subject . The order test randomly assign subject . Design Experiment : This study look effect absence wrist forearm motion shoulder , elbow torso motion four activity . This study combine between-subject within-subject analysis . Independent factor ( subject ) : restriction wrist forearm movement ( simulate wrist rotator component prosthesis ) Levels : - Control group - Braced group - simulate elbow upper limb prosthesis - Prosthesis wear group Repeated factor ( with-in subject ) : add mass ( simulate mass wrist rotator ) Levels : - No added mass wrist rotator - Mass wrist rotator add proximally ( near elbow ) - Mass wrist rotator add distally ( near wrist ) A two-way analysis variance one repeat measure use analyze main effect interaction effect . Data Processing Shoulder , elbow torso motion torque compute use program write Vicon Bodybuilder language . The position marker place subject digitized torso , upper arm , low arm hand segment determine . Euler angle compute . Inverse dynamic anthropometrics use compute force torque . The following outcome measure compare : - Shoulder abduction flexion - Elbow flexion - Torso bending ( L/R ) - Shoulder joint force torque - Elbow joint force torque The maximum , minimum range outcome measure compare subject with-in subject . PREDICTED RESULTS/DISCUSSION Drinking cup : - Braced prosthesis wear group great shoulder abduction compensate lack forearm rotation wrist extension . - Adding mass ( wrist rotator ) distally cause great force torque elbow . This increase force elbow great amputee group due possible injury brachialis insertion tuberosity ulna . Opening door : - Braced prosthesis wear group great shoulder abduction compensate lack forearm rotation wrist extension . These group may also compensate bend trunk instead increase shoulder abduction . - Due increase shoulder range motion coronal plane , brace prosthesis wear group great torque shoulder joint . This increase shoulder joint torque increase mass ( wrist rotator ) add distally due increase lever arm . Lifting 5 lb . box : - This task require minimal wrist deviation , wrist flexion/extension minimal forearm rotation . It include study bilateral task - Braced prosthesis wear group great shoulder abduction less shoulder flexion due limitation forearm wrist . - Shoulder elbow joint force torques great sound hand amputee group use prosthesis guide task . However , opposite could occur . Turning steer wheel : - Braced prosthesis wear group great shoulder abduction compensate lack wrist flexion extension . However , compensation could also occur trunk bending . - For task amputee subject first complete sound arm prosthesis determine compensation occur . CONTRIBUTIONS This work provide many contribution biomechanics field prosthetic design field . One important aspect study human malady set control data use comparison . Documenting kinematic data upper limb four common task allow comparison study many upper limb problem injury . This work help determine location new component consider design , fit instruction upper limb prosthesis . It may also help bridge gap technological innovation engineering field clinical astuteness prosthetist contact end user daily basis . REFERENCES 1 . S.C. Jacobsen , D.F . Knutti , R.T. Johnson H.H .
