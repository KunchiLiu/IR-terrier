	<brief_summary>We propose perform study compare effect bupivacaine fentanyl different drug combination − bupivacaine clonidine . The principal research question study : 1 . To compare effect clonidine ( bupivacaine ) , injected epidural space extent hyperalgesia ( abnormal pain/sensitivity uninjured skin surround operation site ) patient undergo operation bowel disease , fentanyl ( bupivacaine ) . 2 . To compare effect clonidine ( bupivacaine ) , injected epidural space incidence chronic pain 6 month surgery bowel disease , fentanyl ( bupivacaine ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition pain surgical incision site , patient undergo major bowel operation commonly experience pain surrounding ( uninjured ) skin postoperative period − phenomenon know hyperalgesia . In patient hyperalgesia resolve heal wound , patient persists . Recent study show 25 % patient undergoing bowel surgery chronic pain 1 year follow surgery . This pain debilitate significant implication , individual society . For individual significant physical , mental , social economic implication . The burden society significant bowel surgery operation common , many 25 % patient develop chronic pain required ongoing treatment unable work.Chronic pain surgery believe result change central nervous system ( i.e . brain spinal cord ) occur immediately surgery . Indeed likelihood patient develop chronic pain related extent hyperalgesia initial post−operative period . Two important predispose factor emotional state patient genetic predisposition patient develop chronic pain state . In hospital , common western hospital , patient undergo major bowel surgery commonly epidural catheter ( soft plastic tube insert space surround spinal cord fluid ) insert operation facilitate administration , first postoperative day , combination local anaesthetic agent ( bupivacaine hospital ) opiate drug ( morphine−like medicine ; fentanyl use hospital ) . Unfortunately , neither fentanyl bupivacaine appear reduce incidence hyperalgesia . In fact evidence large dos opiates fentanyl increase extent severity hyperalgesia . Moreover , although routinely use hospital , fentanyl associate several adverse effect include nausea vomiting , generalise itching , sedation ( sleepiness ) , respiratory depression ( slow respiration rate ) . Recent study show clonidine inject epidural catheter , provide good pain relief immediate post−operative period , also effective reduce extent hyperalgesia area around incision . This , turn may lead reduce probability patient develop persistent pain . There good evidence show clonidine use instead fentanyl , adverse effect reduce . Although epidural clonidine use success different surgical setting , publish study compare epidural combination bupivacaine clonidine bupivacaine fentanyl ( 3 drug together ) patient undergo abdominal surgery . There good evidence animal human study suggest combination fentanyl clonidine pain−relieving effect either two drug administer . We thus propose compare pain relieve effect three drug combination patient undergoing abdominal operation bowel resection . There various method detect hyperalgesia . Measurement sensitivity touch pain skin around incision site simple reproducible method . This involve use simple device − brush ( test pain touch ) plastic point hair/filament ( detect measure abnormal sensitivity mildly painful stimulus area around incision ) . To determine incidence chronic pain follow patient surgery telephone ask question relate intensity pain well effect lifestyle . To assess patient ' emotional state surgery ask complete questionnaire know reliable validated detection anxiety depression , assessment general well−being . For detection genetic predisposition develop chronic pain , analyse patient ' blood sample gene know either reduce effectiveness pain−relieving medication , make sensitive painful stimulus .</detailed_description>
