	<detailed_description>Central venous catheter ( CVCs ) often require care patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) , indispensable modern-day medical practice . In United States , estimate 15 million CVC day occur year ICU , approximately 80,000 CVC-associated bloodstream infection ( BSIs ) occur year [ 2 ] . Data NNIS system indicate approximately 40 % BSIs associate CVC ICU . This definition , however , include CVC-related BSIs ( CRBSIs ) primary BSIs . In multicenter survey , primary BSIs lead cause BSIs ( 30-35 % ) , follow CRBSIs ( 20-30 % ) , BSIs originate pneumonia ( 20 % ) . The attributable mortality CRBSIs remain debate . It range increase mortality study , attributable mortality 35 % others . In study adjust severity illness , attributable mortality range 0 11.5 % . The excess ICU length stay estimate 9-12 day . The cost CRBSIs therefore substantial , effort require reduce incidence thesis infection . Several publication suggest multiple strategy implement concomitantly . Besides critical importance staff education , technology bring new material could decrease risk CRBSI . Several study demonstrate antimicrobial- antiseptic-impregnated CVCs decrease CRBSIs ICU set . Furthermore , cost-benefit analysis suggest use impregnated CVCs beneficial The recent CDC Guidelines prevention intravascular catheter-related infection recommend use antimicrobial- antiseptic-impregnated CVCs patient whose CVC expect remain place 5 day , ICUs CRBSI rate remain benchmark rate , despite implement comprehensive strategy . This restrict recommended use explain concern emergence resistance , risk adverse effect cost material . CRBSI rate France could lower observe United States . Data two surveillance network indicate rate CRBSI range 1 2 CRBSI per 1000 CVC day . Given low rate , clear antimicrobial- antiseptic-impregnated CVCs would cost-effective . Since organisms responsible CRBSI originate insertion site short-term CVC , rationale try decrease bacterial colonization cutaneous insertion site . Among new material development , chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge ( Biopatch TM ) , place site catheter insertion , propose . In prospective , control , bicenter , randomize , non blind study , dress change every day ( control group ) compare dressing change every 7 day Biopatch ( Biopatch group ) ( Maki al. , ICAAC 2000 ) . 1,401 line ( either CVCs , peripheral arterial catheter pulmonary artery catheter ) include 589 patient . Both group patient comparable . Using proportional hazard model , CVC colonization CRBSI significantly reduce Biopatch group , 29 % 16 % ( HR , 0.62 ) catheter colonization , 3.3 % 1.2 % ( HR , 0.38 ) CRBSI . This study demonstrate significant reduction CRBSI use Biopatch . Given result present ICAAC session , concern , however , validity protective effect Biopatch . Firstly , intervention group associate Biopatch extension time dress change , 2 7 day . Preliminary data cancer patient suggest time dressing change could extend . In randomized study , Benhamou et al recently compare 4-day 15-day catheter-dressing change frequency child undergo chemotherapy . They show skin culture ( 27 vs 23 % ) bloodstream infection ( 11 vs 13 % ) rate different 4-day 15-day group . It therefore unclear reduction CRBSI observe Biopatch group due Biopatch . Secondly , control group Maki 's study use `` placebo '' , i.e . sponge impregnated chlorhexidine . The study therefore blind ICU staff . It strongly recommend examine catheter insertion site daily local inflammatory sign . Biopatch impede monitor insertion site , potential underestimation local infection sign patient . It possible daily examination insertion site control group would conduct remove CVC frequently patient , potential high rate colonization . In addition , study blind , useful validity result group investigator , blind randomize group , review medical chart classify catheter infection . Thirdly , rate CRBSI rather high control group ( 4.45 per 1000 line day ) . It certain benefit Biopatch ICUs low rate CRBSI . The aim study therefore evaluate impact Biopatch , impact dressing change ( every 3 7 day ) reduction CVC infection</detailed_description>
