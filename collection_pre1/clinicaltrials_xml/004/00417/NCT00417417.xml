	<brief_summary>This study determine whether experimental drug call Rilonacept improve artery function patient atherosclerosis , disease fatty deposit artery cause vessel stiffen , impede blood flow . Atherosclerosis believe caused part inflammation . Rilonacept block production protein call CRP , , high level blood associate increased inflammation . Patients coronary artery disease elevate blood level CRP increase risk heart attack , heart failure sudden death compare people low level protein . Patients 18 year age old atherosclerotic coronary artery disease CRP level 2 10 mg/L may eligible study . Patients randomly assign receive four dos either Rilonacept placebo , give 2-week interval injection skin . In addition treatment , patient undergo follow procedure eight visit NIH Clinical Center : - Visit 1 ( screen visit ) : Medical history , measurement vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate breathe rate ) , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood test . - Visit 2 : Blood test , chest X-ray , treadmill exercise testing , tuberculin skin test , brachial artery flow-mediated dilation . Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation use measure well brachial artery ( artery inside elbow ) dilate . An ultrasound device place elbow measure size brachial artery flow blood pressure cuff inflate around forearm . - Visit 3 : Injection study drug . - Visits 4 , 5 , 6 : Review change health medical treatment , measurement vital sign , blood test , EKG , injection study drug . - Visit 7 : Review change health medical treatment , measurement vital sign , blood test , EKG , treadmill exercise testing , brachial artery flow-mediated dilation . - Visit 8 : Review change health medical treatment , measurement vital sign , blood test , EKG , treadmill exercise testing , brachial artery flow-mediated dilation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rilonacept ( Interleukin-1 Trap ) develop antagonist cytokine IL-1 treatment rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory disease . IL-1 cause leukocyte accumulation induce adhesion receptor vascular endothelium stimulate chemokine production . It also stimulate synthesis cytokine , include IL-6 , turn stimulates synthesis C-reactive protein ( CRP ) liver . Based numerous clinical study , CRP emerge risk marker development clinical expression atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , lead publish recommendation measurement CRP screen population subset cardiovascular risk . Endothelial function , evidence stimulate nitric oxide release , also recognize marker cardiovascular disease risk . Thus , patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk factor impair nitric oxide release endothelium compare healthy subject . Recent study show CRP level significantly high CAD patient compare healthy subject , inverse correlation forearm blood flow response acetylcholine measure endothelial function CRP . Endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) primitive bone marrow-derived cell capacity home site vascular injury differentiate vascular cell type , reduce number differentiation capacity CAD patient relative healthy subject . Studies suggest CRP inhibits viability endothelial differentiation capacity EPCs may account reduced number EPCs endothelial dysfunction CAD patient . The objective present study demonstrate potential investigational biological agent , rilonacept , adjunctive treatment CAD examine effect agent CRP level , endothelial progenitor cell mobilization endothelial function randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase I/II clinical trial .</detailed_description>
