	<brief_title>Study Compare Efficacy MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System Vs. MDI Subjects Naive Insulin Pump Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glycemic control remain significant challenge adult , adolescent pediatric Type 1 diabetic . The current first line standard care continue MDI therapy utilize long act analog insulin . Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGMS ) currently use clinician record continuous , retrospective glucose measurement , aid identification glycemic excursion pattern . This data use make future therapy change recommendation . The MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System transmit real-time glucose measurement insulin pump every 5 minute , allow user view current glucose value , well review glycemic excursion trend 24-hour period . Additionally , data download monitor personal computer , use appropriate software , patient physician see complete picture glucose trend time . The System also alert user high low glucose level , allow subject clinicians treat therapeutic target HbA1c carefully monitor condition . Subjects wear MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System compare subject continue current MDI therapy , include long act analog insulin , 12 month period evaluate change glycemic control ( HbA1c ) .</detailed_description>
