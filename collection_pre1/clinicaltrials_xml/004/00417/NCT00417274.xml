	<brief_title>Quinacrine Treatment Patients With Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite modest improvement survival available chemotherapy treatment , androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer remain essentially incurable . Several change gene function characterize malignancy identify . For example p53 gene normal tissue lessen risk cancer growth arrest cell suicidal program . Thus silence p53 gene present cancer tissue contribute growth cancer . In addition p53 gene silence , cell survival pathway , control NF-kB gene , activate lead increase cell survival . Quinacrine activate p53 inhibit NF-kB , thus reestablish cell suicidal program decrease cell survival cancer tissue . Moreover , quinacrine effective several prostate tumor cell line vitro , anti-tumor effect prostate cancer xenograft mouse .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must male , least 18 year age , pathologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Patients must evidence androgenindependent metastatic prostate cancer ( AIMPC ) follow standard antiandrogen withdrawal . AIMPC define category patient metastatic prostate cancer radiologic evidence metastasis ( bone scan , CT , etc . ) castrate level testosterone ( ~ 50 ng/dL ) . 1 . All patient must receive ongoing therapy ensure testicular androgen suppression ( LHRH agonists therapy bilateral orchiectomy ) . 2 . All patient receive antiandrogen therapy [ e.g. , flutamide ( Eulexin ) , bicalutamide ( Casodex ) , nilutamide ( Nilandron ) ] must initiate therapy least 3 month ( 90 day ) prior Baseline visit . Patients must receive prior docetaxelbased mitoxantronebased chemotherapy , refuse ineligible chemotherapy . Previous chemotherapy treatment must complete least 4 week prior Screening , patient must residual therapyrelated toxicity present Screening . Patients must evidence disease progression define follow : 1 . New sit metastatic disease radiographic imaging ( bone scan CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis ) determine refer physician . 2 . PSA progression , define 50 % great rise PSA value baseline level least 1.0 ng/mL , confirm interval least two week . ECOG performance status 02 ( see Appendix 4 ) Patients must adequate organ bone marrow function define : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count great 1500/mL 2 . Platelets great 100,000/mL 3 . Serum creatinine le 2.0 mg/dL 4 . Total bilirubin le 1.5 mg/dL 5 . AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) less 2 time ULN [ less 5 time ULN liver metastases present ] . Sexually active men whose sexual partner woman childbearing potential must agree use medically acceptable form barrier contraception abstinence participation study least six week study drug discontinuation . Written inform consent/HIPAA authorization must provide prior performance studyrelated procedure . Prior allergic reaction history intolerance attribute quinacrine acridine derivative Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , hematological disorder , hepatic disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Lifetime history porphyria psoriasis Documented glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Lifetime history seizure disorder ( except infant febrile seizure ) Lifetime history schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , psychotic disorder . Lifetime history dermatitis allergic/toxic reaction medication Clinical evidence CNS metastases Patients history malignancy ( basal , squamous cell cancer Ta bladder cancer ) within 5 year baseline visit Any grade 2 sensory neuropathy QTc ( Bazett ) &gt; 450 msec Patients NYHA class 3 4 failure Patients myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome within previous 6 month Patients require antiarrhythmic treatment</criteria>
