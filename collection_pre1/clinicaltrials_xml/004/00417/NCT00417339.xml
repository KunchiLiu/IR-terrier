	<brief_title>Protein-bound Uremic Retention Solutes Long Nocturnal Hemodialysis : Longitudinal Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although remarkable progress make , chronic kidney disease still pose major burden individual patient , well society whole . There strong inverse relationship decrease renal function , estimate glomerular filtration rate , mortality rate , especially death due cardiovascular disease . The exact cause ( ) remain elucidated . Uremic toxin might play important role . In course decrease renal function concentration numerous intracellular extracellular compound vary non-uremic state . A still increase number uremic retention solute identify . Renal replacement strategy aim remove potentially harmful substance body . Traditionally much attention pay small water-soluble molecule urea nitrogen creatinine . Based result recent HEMO ADEMEX study , increase small water-soluble solute removal level reach modern dialysis technique ( HD , PD ) seem advantageous regard patient outcome . These finding may point importance distinct group uremic retention solute . In view data describe , protein-bound solute might good candidate . Several advantage long duration hemodialysis observe , include good control blood pressure decrease extracellular fluid volume , lower peripheral vascular resistance improve endothelium-dependent -independent vasodilation . A normalization heart rate variability improvement left-ventricular function note well . Furthermore , anemia control show easier several nutritional parameter improve patient treat long duration HD . The therapy result higher small water-soluble solute removal , phosphate removal great elimination large molecule ( e.g . Î²2-microglobulin ) . It seem appeal question whether good control serum level protein-bound solute achieve long duration ( nocturnal ) hemodialysis . This might another advantage therapeutic modality , may even part explain good outcome patient treat way . The study compare intermittent hemodialysis long nocturnal hemodialysis respect serum concentration several protein bound uremic toxin , well solute removal .</detailed_description>
