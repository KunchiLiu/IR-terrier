	<brief_summary>Background : Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , characterize inattention , hyperactivity impulsivity , early onset , common ( 5-10 % worldwide ; 7.5 % Taiwan ) , clinically heterogeneous , impair disorder . Despite abundance research ADHD , vast majority sample limit Caucasians ; limit information expression , pattern , correlate , outcome ADHD Taiwanese population . Specific Aims : 1. investigate neuropsychological functioning , psychiatric , academic , social outcome ADHD adolescence ; 2. examine psychopathology neuropsychological functioning among parent sibling ADHD probands ; 3. determine component ADHD neuropsychological functioning great familial recurrence risk ; 4. validate classification ADHD comorbid subtypes ADHD use psychosocial , familial , neuropsychological longitudinal data . Subjects Methods : This 5-year proposal consist two part : ( 1 ) 3 year-retrospective cohort study family study design ; ( 2 ) 2 year-prospective cohort study design . Several Chinese version rating scale prepare first 6 month . The sample consist probands ( n=180 ) without ( n=90 ) ADHD , age 11-16 , recruit Children 's Mental Health Center , NTUH epidemiological study . The ADHD diagnosis make 3-6 year ago prior recruitment . Probands parent assess use follow measure ( n=810 ) first 3 year . Only probands reassess last 2 year . The measure include psychiatric interview use K-SADS-E self-reports cover individual familial/environmental domain ; neuropsychological test ( WISC-III , CPT , WCST , CANTAB ) . The informant include probands parent teacher . Long-term Objectives : The long-term objective identify endophenotypes close biological expression gene underlie ADHD , determine familial aggregation specificity regard component ADHD , neuropsychological deficit , identify impact ADHD academic , psychiatric , family , social outcome ; identify cohort family ADHD future neuroimaging , neurophysiological , molecular genetic study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>( A ) Specific Aims The ultimate goal family study identify endophenotypes closer biological expression gene underlie ADHD , identify pattern familial aggregation regard ADHD neuropsychological function , examine impact ADHD family function parental psychosocial adjustment , characterize long-term outcome ADHD adolescence Taiwanese sample . We propose replicate previous study ADHD use novel approach ( ambispective follow-up , bottom-up family study design use mixed clinical epidemiological sample ) validate finding previous study term correlate , pattern , expression , outcome , familial aggregation ADHD attempt determine whether neurological , neuropsychological dysfunctioning also run ADHD probands . With accomplishment goal , study resolve controversy inconsistent finding previous study contribute literature validity ADHD ADHD comorbid subtypes use family data . The specific aim study : 1 . Follow-up component : 1. explore potential risk factor develop ADHD ; 2. investigate expression pattern ADHD adolescence term symptom , neuropsychological , neurological , familial , school social function ; 3. examine symptom continuity determinant persistent ADHD symptom ; 4. identify symptomatic , academic , social outcome ADHD early late adolescence , include use tobacco , betel nut , alcohol drug ; 5. validate comorbid subtypes ADHD use psychopathological , neuropsychological , behavioral , familial social correlate . 2 . Family study component : 1. examine psychopathology neuropsychological functioning among parent probably sibling ADHD probands comparison control probands ; 2. identify familial correlated component ADHD symptom neuropsychological measure . A . Specific Hypotheses The major research question current proposal generate prior research group others list . Under question , specific hypothesis provide : 1 . What major adolescent young adult outcomes child ADHD ? ( Outcome ADHD ) 1 . Children ADHD likely comorbid psychiatric disorder oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder , depression , substance use initial use nicotine , betel nut , alcohol adolescence depression , substance abuse , antisocial personality disorder young adulthood . 2 . Academic underachievement , impaired function several social domain , interpersonal difficulty , low self-esteem apparent adolescence young adulthood . 2 . What correlate endophenotype ADHD ? ( Validity ADHD ) . Adolescents ADHD prenatal exposure alcohol nicotine , family dysfunction , parent-child conflict , sleep-related problem , somatic complaint , neurological neuropsychological dysfunctioning without ADHD . 3 . What specific component ADHD familial ? 1 . We hypothesize parent child ADHD high risk ADHD inattention demonstrate apparent family aggregation hyperactivity . 2 . We also anticipate deficit executive function impair work memory , impulsivity , problem-solving difficulty familial among individual ADHD . 3 . In addition , association risk factor , correlate address previously also investigate post hoc . These analysis correct multiple comparison . Significance Background ( delete ) ( E ) Research Design Methods This 5-year project first three year retrospective cohort study family study design last two year prospective follow-up cohort study design . A.1 : The First Three-Year Study ( 2005.1~2007.12 ) : The major task first 3-year study consist three part : ( 1 ) 6 months—development several rating scale adolescent adult subject , K-SADS-E interview training , pilot study Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries , recruitment subject ; ( 2 ) 2 year 3 months—completion recruitment assessment 180 ADHD family 90 control family ( n=810 ) ; ( 3 ) 3 months—data management analysis adolescent outcome family aggregation 270 family preparation follow-up study young adulthood .
