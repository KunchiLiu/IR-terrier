	<brief_summary>This single center , open-label , Phase I/II study 100 adult subject , age 18 year old occupational risk exposure live H5N1 virus . This study design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity two 90 µg dos investigational inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine give approximately 28 day apart . A blood sample collect immunogenicity evaluation prior vaccination . Subjects maintain memory aid ( appendix C4 C13 ) record oral temperature systemic local AEs 7 day immunization . Subjects encouraged take temperature around time day . All subject receive safety follow-up telephone call 1 3 day vaccination ( approximately Day 2 ) elicit AE concomitant medication information . Subjects return clinic 7 day vaccination assessment AEs concomitant medication , target physical examination ( indicate ) , review memory aid . At approximately Day 28 first vaccination , subject return clinic evaluation vital sign , blood sample collection safety follow-up , confirmation eligibility criterion second vaccination . Safety follow-up identical perform first vaccination . At approximately Day 56 ( 28 day second vaccination ) , subject return clinic immunogenicity blood sample collection , AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination vital sign assessment ( indicate ) . At approximately Day 180 ( 6 month first vaccination ) , subject return clinic final immunogenicity blood sample collection safety assessment . Blood sample collect prior vaccination ( Days 0 28 ) Days 56 180 first vaccination test CDC Influenza Division Laboratory level neutralize HAI antibody CMI response . The primary outcome measure frequencies severity AEs GMTS proportion subject achieve 4-fold rise serum neutralize HAI titer influenza A/H5N1 virus Day 56 . Serum HAI neutralize antibody response ( include frequency 4 fold great rise titer ; GMTs ; proportion subject achieve protective titer neutralize antibody 1 month 6 month first dose ) also assess .
