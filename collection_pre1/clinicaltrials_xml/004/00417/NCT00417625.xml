	<brief_summary>This study test accuracy magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure cardiac perfusion ( blood flow ) . MRI heart measure blood flow heart muscle , collateral coronary artery ( vessel supply blood heart muscle ) may reduce accuracy measurement . This study perform special measurement coronary artery flow pressure patient undergoing heart catheterization catheter-based treatment ( angioplasty stenting ) order compare accuracy cardiac MRI . Patients 21 year age old coronary artery blockage may eligible study . All participant undergo cardiac MRI , produce image heart , well special invasive blood flow test heart catheterization , angioplasty , stenting . During MRI , subject lie table slide scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 45 90 minute . Since heart move breathe , subject ask hold breath intermittently 5-20 second . A medicine call dipyridamole inject vein subject 's arm increase blood flow coronary artery help detect blockage . Pictures take heart , , dipyridamole injection . Another medicine call gadolinium also give vein . This medicine brighten image measure blood flow . During separate catheterization , angioplasty , stenting procedure , subject undergo additional invasive test . The additional test use special guidewire measure coronary artery pressure blood flow , well special ultrasound look inside artery . Patients repeat MRI 2 month catheterization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure perfusion ( blood flow ) heart muscle . Collateral coronary artery ( natural bypass heart ) may reduce accuracy perfusion measure cardiac MRI . We test accuracy measurement subject undergo medically necessary cardiac catheterization catheter-based treatment ( angioplasty stenting ) . We perform special invasive measurement coronary artery flow pressure catheterization order compare cardiac MRI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know suspected cardiovascular disease Age age 21 ( coronary artery disease rare subject less age 21 ) Undergoing medically necessary coronary arteriography Written inform consent The subject must allow access use previous medical information NIH institution order participate research study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Medical Pregnant woman ( uncertain , subject undergo urine blood test ) lactate woman Decompensated congestive heart failure ( unable lie flat MRI catheterization ) Impaired renal excretory function ( calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate le 30mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) ) unless dialysis . MRI Exclusion Criteria ( MRI scan ) : Cardiac pacemaker implantable defibrillator Cerebral aneurysm clip Neural stimulator ( e.g . TENSUnit ) Any type ear implant Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) Any implanted device ( e.g . insulin pump , drug infusion device ) Metal shrapnel bullet . Unable tolerate dipyridamole : Reactive airway disease ( significant asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease unable tolerate beta adrenergic antagonist ) . PostHoc Catheterization Exclusion Criteria ( determine coronary arteriography ) : Excessive tortuosity angiographic feature , opinion catheterization operator , would make invasive physiology assessment unsafe unsuitable Ongoing myocardial ischemia exigency would make study participation hazardous Normal epicardial coronary artery normal perfusion cardiac MRI</criteria>
