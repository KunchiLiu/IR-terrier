	<brief_title>Cost-Effectiveness Specialized Ultrasound Instrument Diagnose Carotid Stenosis Way Reduce Risk Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death , lead cause long-term disability United States . At least half stroke cause carotid stenosis , condition artery neck become blocked plaque harden . Plaque break carotid artery wall travel brain block critical blood vessel , possibly result stroke . Carotid endarterectomy , procedure remove plaque buildup , greatly reduce individual 's risk stroke . Currently , conventional duplex Doppler ultrasound examination use screen carotid stenosis require skilled sonographer physician , therefore expensive . Study researcher develop cost-effective option : specialize ultrasound instrument specifically design perform carotid stenosis screening mean use non-specialist nurse . Previous research show instrument inexpensive , easy use , effective diagnose carotid stenosis . The purpose study evaluate cost-effectiveness alternative ultrasound instrument screen old adult risk carotid stenosis . If instrument show cost-effective , may eventually lead widespread screening reduce incidence stroke . In study , nurse select physician 's office train use carotid ultrasound screen instrument . Patients 65 year age least one risk factor carotid stenosis symptom screen device . Screening take place doctor ' office , convenient , central screen location ; however , case nurse use instrument rather specialized ultrasound technologist . Individuals find carotid stenosis refer undergo conventional duplex Doppler ultrasound examination definitive diagnosis .</detailed_description>
