	<brief_title>Effectiveness Paricalcitol Reducing Parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) Levels X-linked Hypophosphatemic Rickets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>XLH rickets rare inherit disorder bone become painfully soft bend easily phosphate deficiency . This genetic defect cause kidney allow excretion inappropriately high amount phosphate urine . The kidney also unable convert vitamin D form usable body , result inadequate amount active vitamin D. Because vitamin D need absorb calcium phosphate intestine , deficiency reduces phosphate level . Without sufficient phosphate need normal bone growth , individual XLH rickets typically develop skeletal malformation , bone pain , abnormally bow leg . Hyperparathyroidism , condition parathyroid glands excrete excess amount PTH , also occur frequently individual XLH rickets , may play significant role skeletal complication associate XLH rickets . The purpose study determine effectiveness paricalcitol lower PTH level reduce disease symptom individual XLH rickets . This study last 12 month . Participants randomly assign receive either paricalcitol placebo , take form two pill daily duration study . During baseline 3-day inpatient hospital stay , participant undergo physical exam , cardiac ultrasound , bone scan , blood collection , radiographic skeletal survey . The skeletal survey include x-rays various body part . Participants 18 year young undergo radiographic skeletal survey . Study visit participant occur every 2 month end study . These visit include physical exam , review disease symptom , blood urine collection , check medication compliance .</detailed_description>
