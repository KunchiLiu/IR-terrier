	<brief_summary>This phase II study biweekly ( every week ) bevacizumab follow gemcitabine infusional 5-fluorouracil patient stage III IV pancreatic cancer . Patients ' response evaluate every 8 week use usual CT scan technique . RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid tumor ) criterion apply evaluate response . Tumor marker level ( Ca 19-9 ) assess every 4 week , use measure response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine , Infusional 5 Fluorouracil Bevacizumab Patients With Advanced Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Research indicate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , substance make cell stimulate new blood vessel formation , play important role growth metastasis many cancer , include pancreatic carcinoma . Both VEGF receptor overexpressed pancreatic cancer . Bevacizumab work block VEGF growth cancer cell process . The current study combine bevacizumab two commonly use pancreatic cancer drug , gemcitabine infusional 5-FU . Previous study indicate bevacizumab combine anti-cancer drug 5-FU improves patient survival . In addition , research suggest drug administration schedule current study may improve patient outcome compare type administration sequencing . Purpose : The primary objective study ass rate progression free survival 6 month patient advance pancreatic cancer give gemcitabine , infusional 5-FU , bevacizumab . Secondary objective study include measure response rate , 6 month 1-year survival rate , median overall survival . Treatment : Study participant give bevacizumab , gemcitabine , 5-FU . These drug administer intravenous infusion order every week day 1 15 . Treatments give 28-day cycle . Participants therefore receive study drug week 1 3 , receive study drug week 2 4 . Imaging exam perform every 8 week assess disease size . Several test give throughout study closely monitor patient . Tumor level marker assess every 4 week , use measure response . Study treatment discontinue due disease growth severe adverse effect .</detailed_description>
