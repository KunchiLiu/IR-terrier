	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Safety Immunogenicity WRAIR HIV-1 Vaccine LFn-p24 Administered Intramuscular ( IM ) Route Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study seek enroll healthy , vaccine naïve volunteer , 18 45 year old . Recruitment consist use flyer , newspaper advertising , radio , direct mail local military installation , target general population great Washington D.C. area . The study 's primary objective safety tolerability Lfn-p24 give IM . Volunteers screen ( visit 1 ) enrol within 2 12 week prior first vaccination . Study volunteer receive brief Principal Investigator ( PI ) sub investigator . The briefing follow opportunity question volunteer . The PI designee review consent form potential volunteer ( visit 1 ) answer question . After review , Informed Consent sign `` Test Understanding '' complete volunteer , prior enrollment study . A second pre-screening visit ( visit 2 ) occur 3 - 30 day prior first vaccination ( visit 3 ) confirm eligibility vaccination . During visit volunteer opportunity ask question study . On day vaccination ( visit 3 , 6 , 10 ) , volunteer observe 30 minute follow injection acute adverse experience contact day follow injection brief adverse reaction interview . In addition , volunteer complete diary 7 day follow vaccination evaluate clinical investigator significant symptom report . Adverse effect laboratory abnormality tabulate . Routine measurement hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis laboratory test perform subsequent safety general follow visits.renee LFn-p24 Alhydrogel adjuvant deliver IM deltoid muscle interval show . Groups enrol staggered fashion begin low dose group . The subsequent group receive high dos enrol investigator second injection immediate low dose show safe well tolerate ( &lt; grade II toxicity ) , 2 week post vaccination follow-up visit . IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE Group I Subjects *6 0:150µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; 4th Week:150µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; 16th Week:150µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; Group II Subjects *6 0:300µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; 4th Week : 300µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; 16th Week : 300µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; Group III Subjects *6 0 : 450µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; 4th Week : 450µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel ; 16th Week : 450µg LFn-p24 Alhydrogel *Six subject per group include 4 vaccine 2 placebo .</detailed_description>
