	<brief_title>Study Proxinium Plus Best Supportive Care Versus Best Supportive Care Patients With Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck cancer general description disease include several type soft tissue carcinoma develop head neck region . Proxinium recombinant fusion protein bind epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( Ep-CAM ) highly express squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . Proxinium administer via intratumoural injection . The primary objective study compare overall survival time patient treat intratumourally injected Proxinium plus BSC versus BSC alone . Secondary objective study include comparison locoregional tumour control , local progression-free survival , symptomatic benefit safety profile patient receive Proxinium plus BSC versus patient receive BSC</detailed_description>
