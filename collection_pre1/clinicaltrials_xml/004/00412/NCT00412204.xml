	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effects Tiotropium Bromide Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) During Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate effect tiotropium gas exchange exercise . In addition , hypothesize bronchodilation tiotropium open functional lung unit improve gas exchange subject COPD . While study show tiotropium improves exertional dyspnea exercise tolerance , reduces resistive elastic work subject COPD , investigation effect anti-cholinergic bronchodilation gas exchange . This study confirm extend early observation exertional dyspnea exercise tolerance . Efficiency gas exchange evaluate assessment metabolic demand ( VO2 ) cardiac output ( Q ) , ventilation ( V ) overall term i.e . Q/VO2 , V/VO2 . Improved efficiency gas exchange reduce ventilatory demand give workload , provide alternate mechanism observe improvement exertional dyspnea exercise tolerance subject COPD . The overall ventilation require meet metabolic demand dependent alveolar volume easily measure use inert gas . This conveniently measure DLco maneuver measure . In general , ventilation increase metabolic demand increase progressively VA KCO decline patient COPD . These factor may amenable improvement use anticholinergic agent . In addition recruitment additional alveolar volume provide additional pathway blood flow lung increase overall cardiac output enhance responsiveness peripheral muscle patient . These consider exploit potential therapeutic goal . Study Evaluations : Treatment Period : Visits 2 , 3 , 5 6 - Vital sign ( seat ) - 12 lead ECG - Medication washout compliance . - Stage one exercise test ( refer section 11.1.7 ) - Randomization occur Visit 2 . - At visit two subject train use HandiHaler - Study medication dispense Visit 2 5 - Administer study medication ( Visits 2,3,4,5 6 ) Treatment Period : Visits 4 7 - Vital sign ( seat ) - Administer study medication - Constant load exercise test ( refer section 11.1.8 ) - Collect study medication - Medication accountability - Adverse event ( A follow visit must schedule ongoing AEs visit 7 ) Follow Visit ( within 30 day visit 7 ) : This visit take place clinically significant abnormality see result Visit 7 obtain review Investigator Medical Monitor . After informed consent , patient attend initial screen visit ( Visit 1 ) review medical history , clinical assessment , complete pulmonary function test ( plethysmography spirometry ) . A symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test , measurement incremental peak VO2 , carbon dioxide output ( VCO2 ) , minute ventilation ( Ve ) , Vt , respiratory frequency , heart rate ( HR ) , oxyhemoglobin saturation pulse oximeter ( SpO2 ) modify Borg score breathlessness also perform screening , well measurement airway response salbutamol . Patients meet eligibility requirement randomize treatment tiotropium placebo . Double-blind medication dispense HandiHalers take daily morning 22 day . Patients report laboratory two separate treatment period washout 4-6 week treatment period . A patient diary card keep document morning dos study medication calculation compliance . The patient return use medication capsule confirmation medication compliance . Safety assess examine adverse event ( AEs ) , rest exercise electro cardio gram ( ECG 's ) , routine laboratory test vital sign . In event treatment exacerbation oral corticosteroid , schedule visit delay 1 week follow last dose steroid treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must current exsmokers cigarette smoke history &gt; 10 pack year . All patient must diagnosis COPD . Patients maintain daily dose inhaled corticosteroid need constant dose 4 week prior study entry . Patients significant disease COPD . Patients history recent ( i.e . six month less ) myocardial infarction . Patients unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia include patient newly diagnose , clinically relevant arrhythmia ECG perform Visit 1 . Patients hospitalized heart failure ( NYHA class III IV ) within past year . Patients history life threaten pulmonary obstruction , history cystic fibrosis clinically evident bronchiectasis . Patients undergone thoracotomy pulmonary resection . Patients respiratory infection exacerbation six week prior Visit 1 . Patients regularly use daytime oxygen therapy one hour per day investigator 's opinion , unable abstain use oxygen therapy test . Patients currently pulmonary rehabilitation program complete pulmonary rehabilitation program within four week Visit 1 . Patients know active tuberculosis . Patients history cancer within past five year . Pregnant breastfeed woman woman childbearing potential use medically approve mean contraception . Patients know hypersensitivity anticholinergic drug , lactose component inhalation capsule delivery system . Patients history significant alcohol drug abuse previous year . Patients take investigational drug within 30 day 6 half life ( whichever great ) prior Visit 1 . Patients use oral corticosteroid medication unstable dos ( i.e . le six week stable dose ) dose excess equivalent 10 mg prednisone per day 20 mg every day . Patients use rescue medication ( Salbutamol ) 8 puffs/day . Patients used tiotropium ( Spiriva ) within 4 week prior Visit 1 . Patients frequent exacerbation could expect interfere participation trial .</criteria>
