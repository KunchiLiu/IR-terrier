	<brief_summary>This study evaluate use blood thinner , fondaparinux , approve use adult ( child ) child age 1-18 year . Subject blood clot ( thrombosis ) heparin-induced thrombocytopenia need blood thinner eligible participate . Subjects receive daily dose fondaparinux follow blood test 2 , 4 , 12 , 24 hour first dose order determine proper dose age group . The hypothesis child receive fondaparinux able receive daily dose . The currently available alternative agent , enoxaparin , need give twice daily . In addition , evaluation safety medication make assess side effect , especially bleed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Dose Finding Pharmacokinetic Study Fondaparinux Children With Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial ass pharmacokinetics safety novel anticoagulant , fondaparinux sodium ( Arixtra ) pediatric patient thromboembolism . Currently available anticoagulant significant limitation especially applies pediatric population . Thus novel agent improve pharmacologic property need improve care increasingly recognize complication child . Furthermore , available agent long-term anticoagulation child heparin-induced thrombocytopenia warfarin . Anticoagulation warfarin pediatric population problematic due narrow therapeutic index numerous drug food interaction necessitate frequent laboratory monitoring . In addition , oral administration warfarin ( compounded liquid ) difficult young child . Thus novel agent condition need fondaparinux cross-react heparin antibody . The aim study determine proper dose regimen ( dose interval ) safety patient less 18 year age thrombosis heparin-induced thrombocytopenia . Another aim ass utility thromboelastography monitor tool patient fondaparinux . This pilot study total 24 patient 3 age cohort 8 patient per cohort follow : 1-5 year , 6 -12 year , 12-18 year pharmacokinetics medication differ age . Patients receive initial dose 0.1mg/kg subcutaneously daily . After first dose , fondaparinux level draw 2,4,12 , 24 hour administration . Dose adjustment make base 4 hour ( peak ) level trough level 12 24 hour determine daily dose feasible . Thromboelastography perform 2 4 hour 24 hour result correlate plasma activity level . Safety assess physical examination , laboratory testing , necessary diagnostic imaging determine incidence minor major bleeding . Pharmacokinetic analysis well safety efficacy determination make provide valuable information promise new anticoagulant pediatric patient .</detailed_description>
