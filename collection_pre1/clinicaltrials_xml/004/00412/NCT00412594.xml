	<brief_title>2CDA With Rituximab Hairy Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cladribine chemotherapy drug use 10 year treat HCL good result low rate side effect . Rituximab antibody protein target specific molecule surface cancer cell order eliminate . It use 5 year treat number cancer blood lymph node use success treat patient HCL whose disease return previous remission . If find eligible take part study , receive cladribine vein 2 hour day 5 day row . You receive 1 cycle ( 5 day ) treatment . Then receive rituximab vein week 8 week . Treatment rituximab start around Day 28 . After first dose study drug give MD Anderson , later dose drug give community doctor home town . You weekly blood test ( 1 teaspoon ) first 4 week receive rituximab . You repeat bone marrow biopsy start rituximab order see much disease leave behind . You blood test ( 1 teaspoon ) every 2 4 week receive rituximab . A bone marrow biopsy also do end rituximab treatment . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . After complete rituximab , return follow-up visit every 3 month one year . At visit blood ( 1 teaspoon ) test perform . This investigational study . Both drug approve FDA commercially available .
