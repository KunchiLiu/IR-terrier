	<brief_title>Palonosetron Prevention Biochemotherapy Induced Nausea Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palonosetron design work block substance serotonin bind brain gastrointestinal tract , may help decrease nausea vomit . Participants study receive biochemotherapy treatment part routine care . This treatment include 3 chemotherapy drug ( cisplatin , vinblastine , DTIC ) 2 drug stimulate immune system ( interferon interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ) . Biochemotherapy often cause nausea , vomit , loss appetite , weight loss . Palonosetron give study try treat side effect biochemotherapy . If agree take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group . You equal chance assign either group . Participants Group 1 receive palonosetron vein minute start 30 minute receive chemotherapy Days 1 4 therapy . Participants Group 2 receive palonosetron vein minute Days 1 , 3 , 5 . All participant study also receive Ativan vein every 8 hour 5 day . Ativan give additional control nausea also help sedate . In addition palonosetron , may give standard anti-nausea medication lorazepam compazine experience intolerable nausea vomit study . You also ask fill Functional Living Index-Emesis ( FLIE ) questionnaire every day 7 day row . The questionnaire ask nausea and/or vomit experience effect therapy quality life . You stay hospital least 7 day receive treatment . After first course palonosetron give biochemotherapy , doctor decide receive additional course palonosetron give another anti-nausea drug . If doctor decide continue palonosetron , give study . Your participation study 1 course . This investigational study . Palonosetron approve FDA control nausea vomit cause chemotherapy . However , adequately evaluate safety effectiveness patient receive high dose interleukin-2 alone combination chemotherapy . About 30 patient take part study . All patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
