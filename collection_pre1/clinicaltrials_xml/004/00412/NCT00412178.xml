	<brief_title>Effect Mobile Communication With Cellular Phone With Glucometer Glucose Control Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various strategy use electronic technology educational program propose improve quality efficiency care people diabetes . In previous study , introduce new bidirectional communication tool diabetes management term Internet-Based Glucose Monitoring System ( IBGMS ) , demonstrate short-term long-term effect glycemic control type 2 diabetic patient . Other researcher also show effectiveness telecommunication health-care provider patient maintain appropriate blood glucose control . These system allow patient send data doctor , identify specific problem receive recommendation health-care provider frequently few time place limitation traditional face-to-face outpatient clinic . With IBGMS , physician monitor patient ’ self-monitored blood glucose data regular interval , patient communicate physician whenever question . Although bidirectional interactive communication physician patient achieve IBGMS , remain time place limitation . Patients must connect Internet use personal computer input data question IBGMS , physicians visit website regular interval unless received question patient . To improve efficiency communication , link IBGMS short message service ( SMS ) deliver cellular phone . The patient send data doctor IBGMS receive doctor ’ recommendation adjustment drug dosage relate data cellular phone . This system improve efficiency communication patient ’ satisfaction also slightly increase . However , patient still limited place time send question blood glucose-monitoring data . Recently , cellular phone develop measure blood glucose level transmit data directly web server ( Diabetes Phone ) . The combination glucometer cellular phone function make easy patient report self-monitored blood glucose ( SMBG ) level receive feedback doctor . However , know effective cellular phone glucose-monitoring system would control blood glucose level , compare IBGMS test previously . We investigate effectiveness diabetes phone blood glucose control compare IBGMS .</detailed_description>
