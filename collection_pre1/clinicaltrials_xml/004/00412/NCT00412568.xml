	<criteria>1 . Male female , race , least 21 year old time preoperative examination , sign informed consent . The low age limit 21 year intend ensure documentation refractive stability . 2 . Manifest refractive spherical equivalent ( MSE ) 6.00 diopter ( D ) spectacle plane refractive cylinder 3.00 D. 3 . Manifest refraction LADARWaveâ„¢ refraction must within 1.00 D. 4 . Best spectacle correct visual acuity 20/20 good eye . 5 . Demonstrated refractive stability , confirm clinical record . Neither spherical cylindrical portion refraction may change 0.50D 12month period immediately precede baseline examination , confirm clinical record . 6 . Soft contact lens user must remove lens least 2 week baseline measurement . Hard contact lens user ( PMMA rigid gas permeable lens ) must remove lens least 4 week prior baseline measurement 2 central keratometry reading 2 manifest refraction take least 1 week apart differ 0.50 D either meridian ; mire regular . 7 . Located great Washington DC area 12month period . 8 . Consent subject 's command ( active duty ) participate study . 9 . Access transportation meet followup requirement . 1 . Female subject pregnant , breastfeed intend become pregnant study . Female subject give urine pregnancy test prior participate study rule pregnancy . 2 . Concurrent topical systemic medication may impair heal , include corticosteroid , antimetabolite , isotretinoin ( Accutane ) , amiodarone hydrochloride ( Cordarone ) and/or sumatripin ( Imitrex ) . 3 . Medical condition ( ) , , judgment investigator , may impair heal , include limited : collagen vascular disease , autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency disease , ocular herpes zoster simplex . 4 . Active ophthalmic disease , neovascularization cornea within 1mm intended ablation zone , clinically significant lens opacity . 5 . Evidence glaucoma intraocular pressure great 22 mm Hg baseline . 6 . Evidence keratoconus , corneal irregularity , abnormal videokeratography either eye . 7 . History recurrent erosion epithelial basement dystrophy . 8 . Patients know sensitivity inappropriate responsiveness medication use postoperative course . 9 . Any physical mental impairment would preclude participation examination .</criteria>
