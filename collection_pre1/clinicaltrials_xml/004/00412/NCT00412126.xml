	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease process result “ harden artery ” . When artery supply blood oxygen heart muscle become clogged narrowed , heart attack may result , may feel chest discomfort ( angina ) – sometimes even rest . One approach treat condition balloon procedure know coronary angioplasty . The major limitation coronary angioplasty renarrowing artery ( restenosis ) first six month follow procedure require either repeat angioplasty referral bypass surgery . Patients diabetes always identify high rate restenosis poor outcome follow angioplasty , despite important scientific advance . We think level blood sugar control time angioplasty follow month may relate extent restenosis . We expect reduction blood sugar insulin may , turn , reduce restenosis process improve long-term outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Angiographic Outcomes With Hyperglycemic Control Post PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies consistently show diabetes ( DM ) independent predictor angiographic restenosis well clinical outcome PCI . A common criticism early PCI trial stent routinely use . However , even stent use , presence DM associate high restenosis rate lower event rate survival . In series 3,554 consecutive patient ( 715 DM patient ) undergo stenting procedure single centre incidence restenosis total vessel occlusion angiographic assessment significantly high diabetes . Increased restenosis rate consistently demonstrate across broad range lesion type . The pathophysiology restenosis view complex temporal sequence interaction involve several cellular mechanical factor include elastic recoil , thrombosis , intimal hyperplasia , extra cellular matrix elaboration , apoptosis , oxidative stress unfavorable arterial remodeling ( “ arterial shrinkage ” ) . The exposure subendothelial element initiate platelet adhesion activation . Activated platelets site injury secrete growth factor release smooth muscle cell growth inhibition induce proliferation subsequent migration medium intima . Smooth muscle cell proliferation continue beyond phase platelet deposition . Extracellular matrix produce secrete smooth muscle cell migrate injured intimal zone . This hypocellular matrix material form bulk intimal tissue . Although mechanical factor early vessel elastic recoil may play major role follow balloon angioplasty , mechanism significantly affect stented segment stent provide rigid endovascular scaffold . Similarly , late arterial remodelling postulate significant factor development restenosis PCI major effect context stent . Therefore , major mechanism contribute in-stent restenosis aggressive intimal hyperplasia . Recent study demonstrate DM characterize diffuse intimal hyperplasia within stented segment . DM independent predictor volume intimal hyperplasia within stent . The pattern stent restenosis patient DM tend diffuse proliferative therefore likely lead total vessel occlusion . This significant diffuse restenosis difficult manage repeat percutaneous procedure . Hyperglycemia postulate promote restenotic process diabetes follow mechanism : i. endothelial cell dysfunction ; ii . increase platelet aggregation thrombus formation ; iii . dysregulation growth factor expression ; iv . abnormal extracellular matrix deposition ; v. advanced isolation product . Approaches prevent stent restenosis limited effect . Pharmacologic trial universally fail show reduction restenosis rate human subject . Recent report suggest radiation therapy ( brachytherapy ) especially apply locally either via catheter radioactive stent potential reduce proliferative response . Although approach hold great promise unresolved logistic issue , safety issue , cost issue limit wide-spread application . Preliminary study drug-eluting stent show initial promise reduce restenosis rate . However , stent coating counteract restenotic process point stent strut opposes arterial wall little effect neointimal tissue protrude strut lumen . Furthermore , brachytherapy stent coating apply stented segment vessel whereas arterial response balloon injury may also depend flow characteristic ( i.e . rheology ) vessel . Therefore , alternative strategy impact local process dilatation site systematic process vessel remodelling rheology need . Clinical trial data suggest glycemic control may prevent restenosis . A recent study patient type 2 diabetes undergo PCI stent demonstrate significant reduction neointimal area neointimal index among participant randomize glucose-lowering agent troglitazone . Observational data two registry study indicate diabetic patient well-controlled hemoglobin A1c low rate restenosis . Several line evidence suggest insulin safe effective controlling diabetes well reduce cardiovascular event . The recently publish DIGAMI Study patient myocardial infarction randomize insulin infusion follow least three month intensify insulin therapy show 31 % reduction mortality patient receive intensified therapy . Subcutaneous insulin safely use treat diabetes almost 80 year . Patients easily learn inject titrate insulin response home capillary glucose measurement . Greater 85 % patient type II diabetes start insulin achieve safe effective metabolic control one injection per day . Intravascular ultrasound direct sensitive technology available measurement intravascular hyperplasia volume within stent . It technology likely uncover benefit insulin reduce restenosis one exist . This methodology allow research question answer small possible sample size . Recent study demonstrate detailed cross-sectional analysis intracoronary stent motorize IVUS catheter pullback feasible excellent reproducibility , safety store off-line analysis . Establishing mechanistic link glycemic control restenosis support design large clinical study evaluate clinical outcome . Primary Study Question - Does intensive control glucose level insulin patient DM reduce volume intimal hyperplasia within stented segment evaluate intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) 6 month ? Secondary Study Question - Does intensive glycemic control insulin reduce restenosis evaluate quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) 6 month - Does intensive glycemic control insulin prevent clinical event hospital admission unstable angina congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , stroke , revascularization ( PCI , CABG ) death 12 month . Primary Hypothesis : ·Intensive glycemic control insulin diabetic ( DM ) patient reduce intimal hyperplasia within stented segment percutaneous coronary revascularization Secondary Hypothesis : - The reduction intimal hyperplasia relate degree glycemic control ( i.e . HbA1c value ) ; - Event-free survival improve patient treated insulin</detailed_description>
