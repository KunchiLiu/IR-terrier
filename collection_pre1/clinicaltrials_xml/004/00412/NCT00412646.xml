	<brief_title>TMC125-C203 : Phase II Randomized ( Patients Are Assigned Different Treatments Based Chance ) , Placebo Controlled Dose Escalating Trial TMC125 HIV-1 Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study TMC125-C203 phase II , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-escalating trial conduct 2 stage . In total approximately two-hundred fifty HIV-1 positive patient include 2 stage . Patients must 3-class antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) experience ( i.e . previously receive least one protease inhibitor ( PI ) , one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , least 3 month ) must VirtualPhenotype™ show sensitivity least 2 antiretroviral drug use optimized underlying ART . Stage 1 : approximately 180 patient . 60 patient receive placebo , 60 patient TMC125 400 mg b.i.d . 60 patient TMC125 800 mg b.i.d . Stage 2 : approximately 70 patient . 10 patient receive placebo , 20 patient TMC125 800 mg b.i.d . 40 patient TMC125 1200 mg b.i.d . Screening study TMC125-C203 perform six week prior baseline . If patient fulfills eligibility criterion he/she instruct either change his/her current ART baseline visit continue his/her treatment interruption baseline . At baseline visit patient begin dose TMC125 optimized ART ( compose discretion investigator ) , include least two sensitive antiretroviral drug indicate VirtualPhenotypeTM . The new optimized underlying ART start baseline change end trial , except tolerability reason . Adverse event begin start study therapy within 4 week last dose study medication collect . All adverse event still ongoing end treatment TMC125 follow satisfactory resolution stabilization . Upon completion initial 48-week treatment period , patient derive clinical benefit , opinion investigator , option prolong treatment , first optional 48-weeks extension period , follow second optional 48-weeks period ( maximum treatment duration 144 week ) . They continue dose study medication assign randomization , blind setting , addition optimize ART initiate original treatment period study . Four week 120 patient start treatment stage 1 , available data review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . Stage 2 open concurrence DSMB . The primary analysis perform patient two stage treat 24 week drop early . The final analysis perform patient complete trial ( maximum 144 week ) , include follow-up visit , drop early . A pharmacokinetic sub-study perform within framework trial . The patient enrol sub-study additional pharmacokinetic sample take top assessment describe protocol able generate full pharmacokinetic profile TMC125 concomitantly administer PIs.The sponsor intention open-label follow-up study available patient participate trial . Doses placebo , 400 , 800 1200 mg TMC125 , twice daily regimen , select present trial . The investigational medication take orally every 12 hour within 15 minute breakfast dinner 48 week ( optional extension period ( ) maximum 144 week ) . All use underlying antiretroviral drug take prescribed investigator .</detailed_description>
