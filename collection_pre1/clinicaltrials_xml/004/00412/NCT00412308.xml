	<brief_title>A Comparison High vs. Low Tidal Volumes Ventilator Weaning Individuals With Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While respiratory failure people SCI common , clinicians come consensus best strategy manage mechanical ventilation individual whether manage people SCI differently patient . The Consortium Spinal Cord Medicine develop Clinical Practice Guidelines use protocol establish Craig Hospital 1980s 1990s , base clinical experience retrospective , cohort data use historical control . These guideline suggest patient ventilate tidal volume ( VT ) 20-25 cc/kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) . This recommend VT least twice large conventional VT use general medical surgical patient require mechanical ventilation . However , clinical belief people SCI ventilate high VT prevent atelectasis , decrease risk pneumonia , facilitate weaning . This belief foster retrospective , concurrent cohort comparison study individual SCI , find use high VT ventilator ( mean 25.3 cc/kg , PAP &lt; 40 ) associate rapid resolution atelectasis rapid wean mechanical ventilation use low VT ( mean 15.5 ) . Therefore , people SCI clinically manage use high VT past 2-3 decade without prospective data confirm clinical impression . At time ventilator strategy evolve care patient SCI , several clinical study general medical surgical patient require mechanical ventilation suggest high VT lead high airway pressure could actually promote lung injury . This occur high VT increase risk over-distending airway create volume-related trauma.16-19 In multiple study , VT 10-15 cc/kg IBW find produce alveolar over-distention , stretch injury barotrauma . This work lead belief low VT 6-8 cc/kg IBW could helpful protect mechanically ventilated individual ventilator-induced lung injury . Whether finding recommendation apply individual SCI require mechanical ventilation unclear . At least one study mechanically ventilated individual without acute respiratory distress syndrome suggest use low VT ( 6 cc/kg ) increase risk atelectasis . With lack prospective , evidence-based data regard optimal VT person SCI ventilator-dependent , clinician may incline use low VT prevent lung injury , unless definitive data show high volume safe low VT high VT facilitate rapid wean mechanical ventilation . This prospective randomized , control study compare outcomes individual sub-acute , ventilator-dependent tetraplegia use high ( 20 cc/kg ) tidal volume ( VT ) vs. low ( 10 cc/kg ) VT mechanical ventilator support . While use low tidal volume general pulmonary community common , others SCI rehabilitation community use 20 cc/kg IBW tidal volumes high manage attempt wean individual SCI mechanical ventilation . This study address safety efficacy use high VT ventilator wean . A series objective measure standardize protocol implemented ensure equivalent pulmonary management weaning process individual , regardless randomization status . - For individual sub-acute ventilator-dependent tetraplegia , provide high tidal volume ( VT = 20 cc/kg ) result rapid wean mechanical ventilation use low tidal volume ( VT = 10 cc/kg ) 8-week trial . - For individual , use high tidal volume result few episode atelectasis ventilator acquire pneumonia ( VAP ) compare use low tidal volume . - There difference incidence ) barotrauma b ) ARDS use high tidal volume compare use low tidal volume .</detailed_description>
