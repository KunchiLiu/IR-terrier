	<brief_title>Study Azacitidine Treat Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable disease annual incidence 14,000 new case US alone . Despite initial sensitivity corticosteroid , chemotherapy radiotherapy , relapse inevitable median survival 2.5 3 year . The use autologous stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) improve duration disease remission young patient still result median survival 5 - 6 year . Since early 1970s , azacitidine investigate treatment acute leukemia . More recently investigate treatment patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( pre-leukaemic condition ) . It show prolong time development acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) death approve use patient . Azacitidine cytotoxic drug directly toxic cell , prevent reproduction growth . It also able cause cell undergo process whereby mature normal cell . The Myeloma Research Group The Alfred Hospital look effect azacitidine human myeloma cell line laboratory . Azacitidine find prevent cell growth cause cell death . In mouse model multiple myeloma azacitidine prolong survival . The primary aim study determine effectiveness azacitidine treat patient multiple myeloma . The aim study see whether treat patient azacitidine extends time myeloma control , determine number cycle azacitidine require first achieve response determine safe tolerable azacitidine treat multiple myeloma . In first stage total 14 people participate project . If group patient azacitidine show effective treatment multiple myeloma 10 patient invited participate .</detailed_description>
