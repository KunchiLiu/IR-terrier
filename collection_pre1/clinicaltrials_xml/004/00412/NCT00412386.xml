	<brief_summary>Bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV ) form congenital heart disease ( person bear ) . With BAV , heart valve aorta ( blood vessel take blood away heart body ) form right . A person BAV 2 leaflet instead three valve leaflet often thicken . This result block blood flow across valve ( aortic stenosis ) and/or valve leakage ( aortic valve regurgitation ) . From experience least 1/3 patient BAV eventually develop complication . Many patient BAV develop significant problem well adulthood . The common problem BAV patient aortic dilatation and/or dissection . At point , know aortic dilatation dissection occurs.It unclear whether enlargement abnormal blood flow pattern , result shape bicuspid valve , whether way aortic valve and/or vessel form . In word , abnormal shape aortic valve may cause blood flow different way normally would , cause damage aorta blood leave heart . There may problem way aortic valve connects aorta , cause aorta get large break time . It also possible wall aorta patient BAV weaker would patient without BAV . At point , know . It believe investigator determine aorta get large tear , minimize effect prevent altogether . This study collect blood cardiac MRI image forty-five ( 45 ) patient Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Egleston . There study group ( patient BAV ) control group patient ( patient schedule cardiac MRI without BAV ) . All enrol patient blood drawn nursing staff peripheral vein collect tubes test day MRI scan . This test call plasma matrix metalloproteinase level . It believe patient bicuspid aortic valve dilate aortas high plasma level protein . This study compare MRI image plasma matrix protein level patient participate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction-Background The report incidence bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV ) base largely autopsy study vary 0.4 % 2.25 % population . At least third patient bicuspid aortic valve eventually develop complication include aortic stenosis , aortic regurgitation , infective endocarditis , aortic dilatation , aortic aneurysm formation , aortic dissection . Given combination form congenital heart disease think present 0.8 % live birth , Ward suggest bicuspid aortic valve likely result morbidity possibly mortality effect congenital heart defect combine . Since many patient bicuspid aortic valve develop significant problem well adulthood , clinician focus much attention `` normally '' function bicuspid aortic valve . However , mean age 17.8 year 52 % male normally function aortic valve already aortic dilatation , imply associate aortic stenosis and/or regurgitation obligate precursor . Previous study demonstrate association bicuspid aortic valve dilatation aorta . Gurvitz et al . perform echocardiographic measurement aortas child find bicuspid aortic valve significantly large aorta compare control , regardless presence aortic stenosis regurgitation . Nevertheless , definition clinical predictor risk development aortic dilatation/dissection understand mechanism lead aortic dilatation lacking . Specifically , remain unclear yet whether dilatation secondary abnormal flow pattern shear stress result bicuspid valve morphology whether manifestation distinct underlying structural problem aortic valve also aortic root include ascend aorta . Fernandes et al . recently review echocardiogram 1,135 child bicuspid aortic valve find difference among patient relate aortic valve morphology . For instance , associate moderate great aortic stenosis present 9.7 % patient fusion intercoronary commissure aortic valve , vs 25.9 % patient fusion right-coronary non-coronary commissure , none patient fusion leave coronary non-coronary aortic valve leaflet . Moreover , fusion right coronary non-coronary cusp result two-fold high risk least moderate aortic regurgitation compare type bicuspid aortic valve . However , generalize division bicuspid aortic valve three type base commissure fuse likely oversimplification , Fernandes report relationship valve morphology aortic root dilatation . However , Novaro et al . find adult patient ( mean age 54 year ) fusion right/non-coronary commissure tend large mid-ascending aorta compare patient fusion intercoronary commissure , difference reach statistical significance . Nevertheless , personal clinical observation recent publication support assertion individual bicuspid aortic valve may function quite differently one another . For instance , bicuspid aortic valve two nearly symmetric leaflet whereas others may dominant cusp vary degree , result markedly eccentric orifice valve open . In elegant experimental model use excise bicuspid valve analyze intravascular ultrasound high-resolution videography , Robicsek et al demonstrate asymmetric bicuspid valve `` induced extensive recirculation vortex ascend aorta . '' They find vortex `` trap '' sinus Valsalva normal tricuspid aortic valve , instead extend ascend aorta aim toward right anterolateral aspect aorta ( convexity aorta ) . This correlate publish report personal experience perform clinical cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) study patient bicuspid aortic valve aortic root dilatation oft-noted asymmetry pattern dilatation ascend aorta result oval-shaped rather circular aortic root ascend aorta . Extrapolating study Robicsek , variation present geometry bicuspid valve likely result vary degree turbulence even absence aortic valve stenosis . In theory , turbulent blood flow direct particular segment aortic wall may result local change aortic wall lead asymmetric aortic dilatation . These change postulate result receptor present endothelial smooth muscle cell ability adapt sheer stress alter local gene expression turn modulates tension focal adhesion site , integrins , extracellular matrix . Moreover , fibrillin-1 , deficient patient dilate aortic root Marfan syndrome , also find deficient aortas patient bicuspid aortic valve . Similarly , Cotrufo et al . find asymmetric pattern matrix protein expression content asymmetric pattern elastic medial wall degeneration aortic wall patient bicuspid aortic valve . In addition , investigator find difference patient bicuspid aortic valve associate stenosis v regurgitation , suggest focally-directed aortic turbulence may influence local gene expression potentially explain asymmetric pattern aortic dilatation often observe . Lastly , several recent study highlight relationship circulate plasma MMP-2 MMP-9 level either aortic dilatation adult patient thoracic abdominal aortic aneurysm adult aortic dilatation secondary systemic hypertension . In addition , histologic examination aortic aneurysm tissue adult patient bicuspid aortic valve demonstrate increased MMP-2 expression vs. aortic aneurysm adult trileaflet aortic valve . Recently investigator use cardiac MRI ( CMR ) study flow pattern aorta . CMR noninvasive technique permit 3-dimensional anatomic characterization well assessment aortic flow . Markl et al . use time-resolved 3-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging ( 3D-PCMRI ) technique characterize aortic flow normal adult adult aortic root replacement . These author establish 3-dimensional magnetic resonance velocity map useful technique visualize qualitatively assess complex aortic flow pattern normal control patient aortic pathology . Similarly , Kvitting et al. , study adult volunteer 2 patient Marfan syndrome follow aortic valve spar operation , find alteration normal aortic sinus architecture follow surgery result loss normal vortical flow pattern see aortic sinus . Specific Aims 1 . Develop clinically feasible MRI image strategy perform complete evaluation structure functional dynamic heart , include aortic valve , aortic root , ascend aorta , well full volumetric 3-D cin√© flow velocity encode entire aortic root region proximal ascend aorta . 2 . Define qualitative quantitative metric characterize different type bicuspid aortic valve morphology flow pattern . These metric base structural information blood flow pattern aortic root , observe MRI study patient diagnose bicuspid aortic valve , compare observation control subject know normal aortic valve anatomy ascend aorta . 3 . Correlate different bicuspid aortic valve morphology observe characteristic flow pattern risk development aortic dilatation various level aorta , aortic root , proximal ascend aorta , distal ascend aorta . 4 . Quantify plasma concentration matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) level well level specific tissue inhibitor , respectively tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-2 ( TIMP-2 ) tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP-1 ) control bicuspid aortic valve patient . 5 . Correlate biochemical marker extracellular matrix degradation ( MMP TIMP ) presence absence aortic dilatation control patient bicuspid aortic valve . Study Design We prospectively perform cardiac magnetic resonance study 30 patient , age 10-18 year know bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV ) , 15 normal control subject . The BAV patient population consist 15 patient aortic root dilatation body surface area determine publish pediatric echocardiographic normal value 15 without aortic dilatation . Echocardiographic normal index body surface area use , publish normal CMR value aortic dimension pediatric patient use cine MR technique ; however aortic measurement echocardiography CMR pediatric patient population show reveal significant difference except descend aorta . Since either significant aortic stenosis regurgitation associate aortic dilatation , patient exclude mild stenosis regurgitation . As previous publish report , mild aortic stenosis classify mean gradient across aortic valve &lt; 17 mmHg routine clinical echocardiography . Mild aortic regurgitation define routine clinical echocardiography result leave ventricular end-diastolic dimension &lt; 2 standard deviation mean body surface area absence pan-diastolic retrograde flow pulse Doppler evaluation abdominal descending aorta . Studies perform without sedation , breath-holding instruction appropriate . Controls consist 15 patient normal aortic valve aortas undergo clinically indicate CMR study reason chest pain assessment cardiomyopathy find structurally/functionally normal heart . MRI Methods Cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) study perform GE 1.5 T MR system Release 12M4 cardiovascular software . MR image focus visualization high definition anatomy aortic valve aortic root utilize 2-dimensional 3-dimensional FIESTA cine MR sequence . Flow data acquire use 2-dimensional , , whenever allow within image time constraint , fully 3-dimensional phase velocity mapping sequence full vector-encoding velocity 200 cm/s maximum velocity encode VENC , adjust velocity aliasing observe . For 2-D flow acquisition plane across main flow direction in-plane directional component may acquire low velocity encode achieve high accuracy . To resolve blood flow cardiovascular anatomy function cardiac phase ( cine imaging ) , image acquisition synchronize vector cardiogram reconstruct approximately 16-20 cine image represent different phase cardiac cycle . Initial data acquisition structural velocity-encoded imaging perform standard pulse sequence software supply General Electric image device . These scan initially acquire free-breathing mode . A series 5-10 study normal volunteer conduct optimize protocol within constraint , develop guideline prescribe add-on imaging protocol , ideally limit 20 minute scan time , acquisition aortic scan . Priority solution respiratory motion compensation acquisition depend demonstrate reliability available option ( free-breathing , breath-holding , respiratory k-space ordering , navigator- belt &amp; bellows-monitored respiratory gate ) volunteer test study , base capability study subject accommodate option . The scan define protocol add initially clinical protocol subject study . In parallel protocol development implementation standard pulse sequence method , pursue collaboration effort MRI image resource center Stanford University . The Stanford group develop highly optimize image acquisition method allow fully vector-encoded 3-D respiration-ordered acquisition arbitrarily position rectangular 3-D imaging volume . We anticipate acquisition software , require run specialize pulse sequence software off-line image reconstruction one computer workstation , improve coverage overall resolution flow-encoded data significantly . We require expertise research software tool available General Electric , currently enable research WCI scanner Emory . For project , possibly concurrently transition software development effort research project ( Noquist project ) request authorization GE run require research patch Egleston 1.5T GE instrument . Plasma MMP TIMP quantification method Blood sample take peripheral vein nurse staff.MMP TIMP level measure use commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit previously validate use human tissue homogenates.Serum MMP level determine use MMP-2 MMP-9 monoclonal antibodies.Levels TIMP-1 -2 determine use monoclonal antibody .
