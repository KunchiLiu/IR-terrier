	<criteria>Subjects recruit active duty soldier request refractive surgery . Subjects must eligible medical care WRAMC . Male female , race , least 21 year old time preoperative examination , sign informed consent . The low age limit 21 year intend ensure documentation refractive stability . Manifest refractive spherical equivalent ( MSE ) 6 diopter ( D ) spectacle plane refractive cylinder 3.00D . At least five image must capturesd eye ( dilate ) pupil size least 7mm . Manifest refraction LADARWave™ refraction must within 1.00 D CustomCornea® software must allow treatment 6.5mm minor axis 9mm ablation zone . Best spectacle correct visual acuity 20/20 good eye . Demonstrated refractive stability , confirm clinical record . Neither spherical cylindrical portion refraction may change 0.50D 12month period immediately precede baseline examination , sa confirm clinical record . Soft contact lens user must remove lens least 2 week baseline measurement . Hard contact lens user ( PMMA rigid gas permeable lens ) must remove lens least 4 week prior baseline measurement adn 2 central Keratometry reading 2 manifest refraction take least 1 week apart differ 0.50D either meridian ; mire regular . Located great Washington DC Area 12month period . Exhibits strong motivation attend followup visit . Consent subject 's command ( active duty ) participate study . Access transportation meet followup requirement . Female subject pregnant , breast feeding intend become pregnant study . Concurrent topical systemic medication may impair heal , include corticosteriods , antimetabolite , isotretinoin , amiodarone hydrochloride and/ sumatripin . Medical condition ( ) , , judgement investigator , may impair heal , include limited : collagen vascular disease ocular herpes zoster simplex . Active ophthalmic disease , neovascularization cornea within 1mm intended ablation zone , clinically significant lens opacity . Evidence glaucoma intraocular pressure great 22mm Hg baseline . Evidence keratoconus , corneal irregularity , abnormal videokeratography either eye . History recurrent erosion epithelial baewsment dystrophy . Patients know sensitivity inappropriate responsiveness medication use postoperative course . Any physical mental impairment would preclude participation examination .</criteria>
