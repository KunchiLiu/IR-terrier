	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect exercise train insulin resistance subject coronary artery disease independent change weight , diet , effect acute bout exercise . We hypothesize subject CAD high normal impair glucose tolerance perform 12 week aerobic exercise training non weight-reducing diet , would great decrease insulin resistance control measure 72 hour follow last bout exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives To determine effect exercise train insulin resistance CAD subject without diabetes , independent change weight , diet , effect acute exercise . The study approve Research Ethics Review Boards London Hamilton . All participant provide write verbal informed consent . Inclusion Criteria The study population include men woman 18 year age identify practice local cardiologist , whose fast plasma glucose concentration 5.4-7.7 mmol/L , confirm CAD ( diagnose basis previous myocardial perfusion study cardiac catheterization , history myocardial infarction coronary artery angioplasty coronary artery bypass surgery ) . Exclusion Criteria Individuals exclude know type 1 2 diabetes , clinical heart failure , uncorrected significant valvular congenital heart disease , significant obstructive pulmonary disease ( forced expiratory volume 1 sec / force vital capacity &lt; 0.5 ) , uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 220 / 120 mm Hg ) , participation regular exercise program within precede three month , inability perform exercise training , atrial fibrillation , permanent pacemaker regularly use corticosteroid . Individuals experience myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery bypass graft surgery , coronary artery angioplasty within 3 month prior study entry also exclude . Furthermore , individual exclude run-in phase fast blood glucose &lt; 5.4 mmol/L &gt; 11.1 mmol/L 2 hour follow 75 gram oral glucose load . Screening Visit Individuals satisfy criterion underwent screen visit comprise full explanation study , appropriate history physical evaluation one study physician ( NGS RSM ) . Height ( ) , weight ( kg ) , waist hip circumference ( cm ) , percentage body fat use bioelectrical impedance measure . A 75g OGTT , use fast 2 hour sample , perform follow overnight ( ≥12 hour ) fast . Participants satisfy study selection criterion subsequently enter run-in-phase . Run-in Phase The study dietician assess participant administer 24-hour food recall semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire . An individualized isocaloric AHA Phase I diet write verbal instruction prescribe patient . Participants also teach complete three-day measure food record . The purpose run-in phase participant follow AHA Phase I diet least 3 week , therefore duration run-in phase zero , three , six week depend patient ’ current diet determine study dietician . At midpoint run-in phase , food record review ensure completeness food description , preparation method , portion size , additional dietary counseling provide require . Baseline test carried completion run-in diet phase . Baseline Testing Measurements include OGTT , waist circumference , body fat , symptom-limited CET measurement oxygen consumption , 3-hour FSIGT determine insulin resistance . The CET perform first day subject ’ baseline assessment . On morning CET participant instruct take usual medication , eat light breakfast abstain caffeine . VO2 continuously measure throughout CET peak VO2 serve index exercise capacity . The CET conduct accord accept guideline . The FSIGT perform 72 hour follow baseline CET overnight fast . Intravenous cannula place antecubital vein arm . A glucose injection ( 500mg/kg 50 % solution ) give 1 minute start time 0 minute . Blood sample determination glucose insulin take -10 , -5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 120 , 140 , 160 , 180 minute follow conclusion glucose infusion . Twenty minute follow start intravenous glucose , 0.04 U/kg human insulin ( Novolin R ) inject . Insulin sensitivity determine use validate MINMOD-IS technique . The MINMOD-IS determination make one investigator ( DF ) blind patient ’ group allocation . After satisfactory completion baseline testing , participant randomize either 12-weeks ET UA . Randomization computer generate follow non-blocked strategy deliver use sealed envelope . All individual record outcome measurement blind group allocation participant . In order maintain stable weight throughout study addition well-controlled AHA Phase I diet , ET participant underwent supervised weekly weigh-ins prescribe supplemental food proportion AHA Phase I diet study dietician weight loss ≥ 1 kg occur two consecutive weekly supervise weigh-ins . Participants UA group instruct continue usual activity follow AHA Phase I diet used week prior randomization weigh weekly home scale , first thing morning minimal attire . Participants contact study dietician ≥ 1 kg weight change occur two week . Appropriate dietary adjustment make ensure stable weight . The ET group prescribe exercise 4 times/week 12 week . This exercise comprise walking , stationary cycling treadmill exercise 40 minute per session 75 % baseline CET peak heart rate 5-minute warm cool period . Participants teach monitor heart rate exercise adjust exercise intensity accordingly . Two session conduct supervision Hamilton Health Science Cardiac Rehabilitation Program remain session carry home . Ten 12 week follow randomization participant underwent endpoint assessment , comprise test baseline . These assessment OGTT &amp; clinical evaluation ( week 11 ) , CET ( week 12 ) FSIGT ( 72 hour CET ) . All participant instruct perform exercise train final CET FSIGT . Statistical Issues Fifty subject overall require satisfy study ’ sample size assumption least 15 % decrease insulin resistance ET compare UA could demonstrate 80 % power , 2-tailed alpha error 5 % , potential 20 % loss follow rate . A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test use compare change MINMOD-IS course study ET UA group . Remaining analysis compare outcome ET UA group utilized independent t-tests continuous data normal distribution Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests continuous data normally distribute . Regression analyse do evaluate relationship change MINMOD-IS study important study variable change weight peak VO2 . Analyses deem significant two-tailed P-value &lt; 0.05 achieve . All value report mean +/- standard deviation unless otherwise specify .</detailed_description>
