	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study CNTO 328 Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , Multiple Myeloma , Castleman 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study use type drug call anti-IL-6 antibody , also know CNTO 328 . An antibody substance body fight infection . CNTO 328 investigational drug show slow tumor growth shrink tumor test animal . In previous clinical trial patient multiple myeloma ( blood cancer ) , CNTO 328 appear potent inhibitor IL-6 . One study complete kidney cancer . There study ongoing human multiple myeloma prostate cancer see CNTO 328 safe see effect type cancer . This open-label , nonrandomized , dose-finding phase 1 study CNTO 328 patient B- cell non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , Multiple Myeloma , Castleman 's disease . The purpose study evaluate different dos schedule CNTO 328 see dose/schedule safe . CNTO 328 give small tube go directly vein , call intravenous ( IV ) infusion . Depending patient enters study , patient assign receive one course CNTO 328 one follow group : Group 1 : 3 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every 2 week 4 dos . Group 2 : 6 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every 2 week 4 dos . Group 3 : 12 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every 3 week 3 dos . Group 4 : 6 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every week 7 dos . Group 5 : 12 mg/kg 2 hr IV infusion every 2 week 4 dos . Group 6 : 12 mg/kg 1 hr IV infusion every 3 week 3 dos . Group 7a : 9 mg/kg 1 hr IV infusion every 3 week . Group 7b : 12 mg/kg 1hr IV infusion every 3 week Castleman 's patient . In Groups 1-5 , overall amount study drug give increase high group . Group 1 fill Group 2 start Group 2 fill Group 3 start , etc . In way , CNTO 328 test safely . Both patient study doctor know group patient assign . Patients remain group assign entire time participation study . Up 70 patient may take part study . Patients Groups 1-6 study 34 week prior Post Study Follow-Up . Screening : 4 week first dose schedule CNTO 328 . Treatment : 6 week treatment CNTO 328 . Extended Dosing : Patients assign Groups 1-6 , cancer disease become stable well receive CNTO 328 , may able receive additional course study drug . Patients Group 7 study disease get bad , long tolerate CNTO 328 , study doctor feel best interest stop CNTO 328 longer wish participate study . Long Term Follow-Up : Patients contact telephone every six month last infusion study drug ass patient 's disease status survival . Dose ( 6-12 mg/kg ) frequency ( weekly 2 3 week interval ) dose depend upon Group assignment . CNTO 328 give small tube go directly vein , call intravenous ( IV ) infusion . The infusion take 2 hour complete group 1-5 1 hour Groups 6 7 . In Groups 1-6 , CNTO 328 give every 1 , 2 3 week day 1 43 depend treatment assignment . In Group 7a Group 7b , CNTO 328 give day 1 21 day cycle .</detailed_description>
