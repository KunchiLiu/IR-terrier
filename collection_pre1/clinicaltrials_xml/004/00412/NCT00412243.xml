	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose drug clofarabine cyclophosphamide give together treatment relapse refractory ALL . The safety combination treatment also study . Objectives : Phase I : 1 . To establish toxicity safety propose combination 2 . To establish dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination proceed phase II part study Phase II : 3 . To establish efficacy ( complete overall response ) propose combination . 4 . To analyze pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) property clofarabine well impact DNA repair leukemic blast propose combination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clofarabine drug design interfere disrupt important metabolic pathway cancer cell interfere multiplication slow stop growth . Cyclophosphamide also design destroy cancer cell interfere multiplication slow stop growth spread throughout body . Cyclophosphamide commonly use treatment ALL . If find eligible take part study , receive clofarabine vein 60 minute , day 3 5 day . Cyclophosphamide give vein 3 hour , twice day 3 5 day . These 3-5 day consider 1 cycle therapy . As safety combination establish yet , least first 2 participant study receive clofarabine 3 day cyclophosphamide low dose usually give 3 day ( 6 dos ) . Should serious side effect relate study drug , next group 2 participant receive clofarabine 3 day slightly high dose cyclophosphamide 3 day ( 6 dos ) . Should still serious side effect level , 2 level test clofarabine cyclophosphamide give 4 day eventually 5 day . Should serious study drug-related side effect occur point increase dos , certain dose level along increase define appropriate dose future participant receive . It estimate 30 participant receive therapy dose escalation portion study ( Phase I ) . It estimate 25 participant receive therapy dose level consider best ( Phase II ) . During treatment , physical exam least week . You may also ask level daily activity , feeling , medication take currently . Routine blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn least 1-3 time weekly frequently consider necessary . A bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy repeat start Day 14 repeat every 1 2 week study doctor decide sure whether responded . In case , repeat bone marrow test may necessary , decision make treat doctor . If respond well first round therapy , may receive 6 additional course therapy . Each course repeat every 3 7 week slightly low dose drug use first round therapy . Later dose also change depend type side effect may experience early round therapy . At end study , heart scan ( either Echo MUGA scan ) repeat . About 1 tablespoon blood take routine blood test . A focused physical exam may also repeat . This investigational study . All drug study FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study investigational . . About 55 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
