	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) patient receive inadequate treatment complete therapy likely remain infectious , thus contribute continuous spread TB infection community . Despite widespread use Directly Observed Therapy , defaulter remain important problem TB control programme . In Sénégal , defaulter rate reach 30 % , hamper dramatically effectiveness control . New strategy deliver treatment TB patient ensure proper adherence adapt local situation urgently need . Objectives The overall objective project improve tuberculosis treatment success rate Sénégal . The specific objective : 1. assess current situation tuberculosis ( TB ) Sénégal 2. identify determinant cure , 3. develop measure improve patient ’ compliance treatment adapt local situation , acceptable , affordable sustainable 4. evaluate impact measure TB control . Methods The propose research seek develop test innovative method improve cure rate TB patient . It explore factor success TB treatment use inter-disciplinary approach , integrate social science economic analysis TB research . The project compose 3 comprehensive phase : - Phase 1 : baseline assessment TB situation . - Phase 2 : anthropological study , investigate various domain contribute patient cure use range qualitative research method . At end investigation , expect determinant care clearly identify . On basis , suitable method improve patient ’ adherence treatment tailor develop . - Phase 3 : method test compare use cluster randomise controlled trial design , population serve defined health centre . Their efficacy measure term improvement classical TB control programme indicator ( cure rate , defaulter rate , failure rate , death rate ) . The method also evaluate acceptability TB patient community feasibility ( duration : 24 month ) . Expected result : Methods improve patient ’ adherence treatment affordable , acceptable sustainable develop test accord qualitative quantitative criterion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General Project Methods The propose research seek develop test innovative method improve treatment success rate TB patient Senegal . It explore factor success TB treatment use inter-disciplinary approach , integrate social science economic analysis TB research . The project compose 3 comprehensive phase , run concurrently complement : - Phase 1 : baseline assessment TB situation . It first propose assess magnitude TB problem mean control standard baseline assessment ( 6 month ) . - Phase 2 : anthropological study , investigate various domain contribute patient cure ( patient , community , general health service , policy maker TB control staff ) , use range qualitative research method ( 12 month ) . At end investigation , expect determinant care clearly identify comprehensive understanding relation/interface . On basis , suitable method improve patient ’ adherence treatment develop . - Phase 3 : method test compare use cluster randomise controlled trial design , population serve defined health centre . Their efficacy measure term improvement classical TB control programme indicator ( cure rate , defaulter rate , failure rate , death rate ) . The method also evaluate acceptability TB patient community feasibility ( 24 month ) . Methods Intervention Trial : The intervention intend improve access care increase adherence treatment , target simultaneously DHC staff , TB patient community , include four component : 1. improve communication health personnel patient appropriate training ; 2. decentralise treatment remote health post involve community health worker ( CHW ) ; 3. strengthen DOT strategy give patient opportunity choose treatment supporter ; 4. reinforce supervision health post DHC team . The intervention apply District Health Centre ( DHC ) level , unit randomisation . Sample Size : Based detection average 100 new TB case per DHC per year , estimate coefficient variability k=0.12 , estimate success rate control arm 65 % use conventional TB control program procedure , 80 % power type I error 5 % , require sample size aim detect difference least 15 % treatment success rate intervention control arm eight DHCs per arm . In order take account variation recruitment TB patient DHCs , randomisation stratify baseline detection rate sputum smear positive case 2001 , classify less 60/100 000 equal 60/100 000 . Patients follow-up DHCs functional TB diagnosis treatment unit , research project undertake , eligible inclusion . The study population consist individual present DHC June 2003 May 2004 newly diagnose sputum-smear positive pulmonary TB ( least two positive specimen ) , age 15 year , live district serve DHC . Written inform consent obtain recruitment patient followed-up course eight month treatment regimen , last patient see January 2005 . Smear-negative extra-pulmonary tuberculosis case , well re-treatment case , eligible study . Patients recruit study June 2003 May 2004 follow till January 2005 . Endpoints : Primary endpoint proportion recruit patient experience treatment success ( cured + complete treatment ) , proportion patient default treatment completion . A `` cured '' patient define negative sputum-smear eight month least one previous occasion . Patients “ complete treatment '' miss smear result finish treatment regimen . A `` defaulter '' define patient definitely stop treatment completion .</detailed_description>
