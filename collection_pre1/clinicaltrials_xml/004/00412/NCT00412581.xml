	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide relate drug call Thalidomide , widely use certain side effect . Lenalidomide belong family drug work act body 's immune system , make `` anti-inflammatory '' cell . This type cell normally find body believe help reduce growth cancer cell slow production new cancer cell . DTIC anti-cancer drug . It design cause cancer cell death create DNA break nucleus cell . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You ask question medical history , complete physical exam , include measurement temperature , pulse , blood pressure , respiratory ( breathe ) rate , weight height . You ask surgery medication take . Your ability perform daily activity check simple physical test ( walk squeeze ball ) . You also blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test test measure thyroid hormone . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . You chest x-ray CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis ( waist ) . You require MRI CT scan brain . If doctor feel necessary , may need CT scan head neck bone scan . To perform bone scan , small dose radioactive technetium administer intravenously ( IV -- needle vein ) . The technetium collect area bone involve metastatic cancer `` light '' area bone scan . The result test show eligible participate study . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If still eligible take part study , begin study treatment . You take Lenalidomide mouth every day 2 week , follow 1 week `` rest . '' This 21-day period refer one `` study cycle . '' You take Lenalidomide empty stomach . You fast 1 hour take Lenalidomide . DTIC give IV Day 1 every study cycle . Three dose level DTIC test study . The first 3 participant give first ( low ) dose level DTIC . After safety dose DTIC confirm start dose level , next 3 6 participant give second dose level DTIC . After safety new dose level confirm , dose DTIC increase third ( high ) dose level test study . When high DTIC dose find few side effect give Lenalidomide , 10 patient treat best dose level . Patients low dose level dos change high well tolerate dose find . Once patient start dose , increase . You receive treatment Lenalidomide DTIC outpatient basis UT M.D . Anderson Cancer Center . At start 21-day study cycle , come clinic receive 14-day supply Lenalidomide , receive dose DTIC IV . You provide study drug diary time give supply Lenalidomide , write side effect experience . During study visit , physical exam ( include measure weight ) , medical history record . Your doctor ask side effect experience . You bring study drug diary , unused medication , empty package medication study visit . Women able child pregnancy test perform study visit begin study cycle . You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test . You also repeat performance status test . During study visit begin Cycle 3 ( 6 week start treatment ) , check see disease respond treatment . You chest x-ray CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis . If doctor feel necessary , also EKG heart MRI brain . These test may do often doctor feel necessary . You continue receive treatment long disease shrink get bad , study doctor decide safe . You take study disease progress intolerable side effect occur . If take study reason , schedule final study visit . You physical exam check side effect relate study treatment . You chest x-ray , CT scan , ECG , possibly MRI well . You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test . You ask new symptom may experience treatment stop . This investigational study . DTIC approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma . The FDA authorize Lenalidomide use research . Up 28 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
