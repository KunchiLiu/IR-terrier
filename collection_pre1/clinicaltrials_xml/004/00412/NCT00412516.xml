	<brief_summary>The previously conduct JEV01 study look immunogenicity safety concurrent administration Japanese Live Attenuated SA 14-14-2 measles vaccine one month post vaccination time point . The purpose JEV01 study help ensure safety SA 14-14-2 simultaneously administer measles vaccine , pave way use routine EPI program . As follow-on JEV01 , study enroll infant receive vaccine complete JEV01 study . This study , however , provide crucial data help ensure long-term immunogenicity concurrent administration vaccine provide valuable information determine use vaccine routine immunization program . This study plan original protocol JEV01 , long-term data point include . The hypothesis child receive JE live attenuate SA 14-14-2 vaccine measles vaccine time long-term ( 24 36 month post vaccination ) protection disease level receive vaccine different interval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining Long-Term Safety Efficacy Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine When Given With Measles Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Japanese encephalitis lead cause viral neurological disease disability Asia . The severity sequela , together volume case , make JE important cause viral encephalitis world . Approximately 3 billion people—including 700 million children—live Asian area risk JE . JE commonly infect child age 1 15 year , also infect adult area virus newly introduce . More 50,000 case report annually cause estimate 10,000 15,000 death . This figure believe represent small proportion disease burden actually exist . An effective vaccine exist since 1941 , reach poor country Asia . During 60 year vaccine available , JE infect estimate 10.5 million child , result 3 million death 4 million child live long-term disability . Control disease limit due poor disease surveillance , limited unstable vaccine supply , lack guidance programmatic support immunization , limited advocacy . A successful vaccine safe , efficacious , affordable , administer single dose , easily incorporate routine Expanded Programmes Immunization ( EPI ) program . This trial design determine potential interference measles vaccine Japanese encephalitis vaccine 12 , 24 , 36 month post-vaccination . As vaccine use routine EPI system time , similar measles yellow fever vaccine ( also Flavivirus ) administer , imperative collect long-term data show neither vaccine interfere seroconversion co-administered.This information help ensure subject safety facilitate programmatic efficiency , reduce number immunization visit parent health care worker .</detailed_description>
