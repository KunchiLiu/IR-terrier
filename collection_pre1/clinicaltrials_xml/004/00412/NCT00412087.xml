	<brief_summary>Science News ( October 2004 ) call vitamin D deficiency `` silent epidemic '' America , group unaffected . Using new guideline optimal vitamin D level , 90 % African American woman suffer vitamin D deficiency . Deficiency pregnancy profound effect develop fetus . Other system besides bone affect vitamin D deficiency , include increase risk autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , type I diabetes , certain cancer . This study propose examine manage vitamin D level one thousand woman underserved population South Carolina . The woman patient population seek OB/GYN Pediatric service Eau Claire Cooperative Health Centers , Inc. ( ECCHC ) , network ten clinic three county center state approximately 70 mile Charleston , SC . ECCHC one approximately 1000 community health center support Health Human Services ' ( HHS ) Health Resources Services Administration 's ( HRSA ) , Bureau Primary Health Care . The research objectives project manage Pediatric Nutritional Sciences Research Center Children 's Research Institute Medical University South Carolina , Charleston , SC , collaboration ECCHC . The research aim evaluate vitamin D level possible contribute factor level pregnant woman . Women present ECCHC within first trimester pregnancy randomize one two dos vitamin D supplementation show effective group . Each pregnant mother begin supplementation 12th week pregnancy follow closely throughout pregnancy one year determine effectiveness supplementation vitamin D status , overall health mother , infant follow delivery . We expect observe severe vitamin D deficiency considerable percentage mother infant receive care ECCHC , especially individual darker pigmentation . When extent vitamin D deficiency within racial/ethnic group well define supplementation requirement identify , well able establish guideline supplementation health maintenance , set policy recommendation dietary recommend intake vitamin D. Those woman infant identified deficient vitamin D important establish community health care policy vitamin D surveillance supplementation strategy . The result allow u implement specific dietary and/or medical intervention aim correct hypovitaminosis D population study similar population serve 1000 community health center nationally .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With avoidance sunlight exposure due lifestyle change concern regard skin cancer resultant widespread use sunscreen , Americans meeting need vitamin D either skin photosynthesis dietary intake . A study publish Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) laboratory Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) reveal 42 % African American woman childbearing year exhibit deficiency D vitamin ( hypovitaminosis D ) ( 1 ) . Using new guideline optimal vitamin D level , 90 % African American woman suffer vitamin D deficiency ( 2 ) . Science News ( October 2004 ) call vitamin D deficiency `` silent epidemic '' America , group unaffected ( 3 ) . Deficiency pregnancy profound effect develop fetus . Vitamin D deficiency affect system besides bone : associate later , lifelong sequela , notable increase risk autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis ( 4 ) , multiple sclerosis ( 5,6 ) , type I diabetes ( 7,8 ) , certain cancer ( 7,9-14 ) . Prevention intervention study recently undertake ( 3 ) . A reexamination dietary vitamin D requirement various vulnerable population U.S. desperately need ( 2,3 ) . As representative community diverse population , Eau Claire Cooperative Health Centers South Carolina ( ECCHC ) serve large percentage African American well Caucasian Hispanic woman child consider high risk vitamin D deficiency . ECCHC eight clinic provide 1o care service patient special emphasis Pediatric OB/GYN service . Defining prevalence vitamin D deficiency patient population optimal vitamin D supplementation strategy woman infant become prototype recommendation applicable community throughout U.S . In Specific Aim 1 , vitamin D status cross-sectional sample 1000 pregnant woman present ECCHC prenatal care determine measure serum calcium , phosphorus , intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) , 25 ( OH ) D , nutritional marker vitamin D function ethnicity . Maternal health characteristic , skin pigmentation ( use reflectance spectrophotometry ) , dietary characteristic ( use establish food frequency questionnaire ) , lifestyle profile ( use standardize questionnaire ) ascertain well . Any deficiency note lead specific recommendation vitamin D supplementation research team , standardized strategy monitor status follow initiation supplementation Specific Aim 2 . Based extensive preliminary data , supplementation regimen implement efficacy achieve optimal vitamin D status woman test Aim 2 : woman within three racial group ( African American , Hispanic Caucasian ) stratify two group initial 25 ( OH ) D level : Group 1 , &lt; 32 ng/mL ( less optimal vitamin D status ) Group 2 , â‰¥32 ng/mL ( optimal vitamin D status ) . Based ongoing NIH study pregnant woman , group randomize receive one two dos start 13 week ' gestation : 2,000 4,000 IU vitamin D3/day universal one-month 2,000 IU/day dose run-in period 12 week ' balance race/ethnicity . The randomization schema allow determination efficacy safety deficient replete entry study function race/ethnicity season . Anticipated Results Future Studies : We expect observe vitamin D deficiency considerable percentage mother newborn infant receive care ECCHC , especially individual darker pigmentation . In Aims 1 &amp; 2 , determine prevalence vitamin D deficiency racial/ethnic group , establish guideline supplementation health maintenance , policy recommendation dietary recommend intake vitamin D U.S . The result allow u implement specific dietary and/or medical intervention aim correct hypovitaminosis D population study similar population serve 1000 community health center nationally .</detailed_description>
