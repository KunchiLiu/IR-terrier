	<detailed_description>Rationale : Patients treat chronic renal replacement therapy expose cardiovascular problem suffer accelerate sever atherosclerosis . Classical risk factor atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) explain full risk CVD dialysis patient . Additional risk factor therefore likely exist . The uremic syndrome attribute progressive retention large number compound , normal condition excrete healthy kidney . Uremic toxins parathormone ( PTH ) , vitamin D phosphate , cause development renal osteodystrophy ( ROD ) , i.e . disordered calcium phosphate metabolism . Both condition hyperparathyroid adynamic bone disease ( ABD ) lead elevate calcium x phosphate product increase vascular calcification , might occur intimal medial layer vessel wall . It important consider process separately , vascular consequence ( occlusion atheromatosis vascular stiffen medial calcification ) different . Moreover , difference uremic non-uremic intimal plaque size composition , markedly increase calcium content . Hence , observation important socio-economic impact increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Hypothesis : We hypothesize uremic toxin dialysis patient influence directly and/or indirectly development atherosclerosis , vascular calcification CVD . Objectives : To asses histology arterial vessel patient end-stage renal failure evaluate relationship serum uremic toxin . To determine biochemical clinical risk factor might influence development vascular calcification diagnostic performance assessment CVD morbidity mortality . Methods : A cross-sectional study conduct Department Nephrology Skopje . After initial assessment patient follow 2 year prospective part study . Seventy-five ninety patient include , one-year period propose number patient recruit . The study cohort divide 3 subgroup : 1 ) patient initiation dialysis therapy , 2 ) patient regular dialysis treatment year 3 ) patient undergo renal transplantation . During follow-up period cardiovascular cerebrovascular event moment occurrence record , well peripheral vascular disease . Moreover , clinical , laboratory data arterial vessel sample histology collect moment inclusion . Expected outcome : We expect determination high correlation coefficient histological parameter various uremic toxin , responsible development atherosclerosis vascular calcification , lead accelerate progression CVD dialysis patient . This determination could help design new preventive therapeutic tool patient . The result work impose positive impact quality life therapeutic cost related atherosclerosis dialysis population also pre-dialysis chronic renal failure population kidney transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
