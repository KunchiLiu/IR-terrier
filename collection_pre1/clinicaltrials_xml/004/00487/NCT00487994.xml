	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Lapaquistat Acetate Taken Alone With Atorvastatin Subjects With Primary Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization , CHD lead cause death worldwide . In 2001 , CHD cause 7.2 million death estimate 2020 indicate annual CHD death increase 11.1 million . These statistic suggest improve option need treat hypercholesterolemia dyslipidemia . The balance among cholesterol synthesis , dietary intake , degradation normally adequate maintain healthy cholesterol plasma level . However , patient hypercholesterolemia , elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lead atherosclerotic deposition cholesterol arterial wall . Consequently , population establish lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality . The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III therefore identify control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol essential prevention management CHD . Additional lipid risk factor designate National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III include elevate triglyceride , elevate non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( atherogenic lipoprotein ) , low level high-density lipoprotein cholesterol . Lipoproteins rich triglyceride , very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , appear contribute atherosclerosis , whereas apparent protective effect high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , likely related high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-facilitated transport cholesterol away atherosclerotic deposit , may limit low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration . Initial dietary lifestyle measure take control dyslipidemia often inadequate , patient require pharmacologic intervention . Currently , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) first-line monotherapies often prescribe reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , diet therapeutic lifestyle change . However , statin monotherapy , many patient fail reach National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommend level low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction . As result , statin dosage must increase additional treatment add achieve treatment goal . Increasing statin dosage may result decreased tolerability potential safety concern , contribute high discontinuation rate statins prescription low often ineffective dos . Further , although effectiveness increase dose varies among statin , general , double dose minimum effective dose find decrease serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol additional 6 percent . TGRD develop orally active squalene synthase inhibitor , TAK-475 ( lapaquistat acetate ) treatment dyslipidemia . Lapaquistat acetate inhibits biosynthesis cholesterol inhibit enzyme squalene synthase , catalyze conversion farnesyl diphosphate squalene—a precursor final step cholesterol production . Study Participation anticipate two year .</detailed_description>
