	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness vaccine call AMA1-C1/ISA . Malaria serious infection red blood cell cause parasite . There 300 500 million malaria case worldwide year . About 2 3 million death annually malaria alone along disease . Researchers hope find vaccine fight malaria . Patients age 18 45 good health , pregnant breast feeding , history malaria , live 1 month area malaria prevalent may eligible study . There 28 participant , assign one three dose group : 12 get 5 microg , 12 get 20 microg , 4 get 80 microg AMA 1-C1 formulate ISA 720 . The vaccine might block parasite entering red blood cell cause disease . This study first time vaccine give human being test . Patients medical history , physical exam , laboratory test , pregnancy test . The study last 48 week . One two vaccination give injection , least 12 week apart . After vaccination , patient ask stay clinic least 30 minute observation . They return clinic Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 56 vaccination . There check vital sign , brief physical exam , history symptom medication take since last visit , blood test check vaccine safety effectiveness . Photographs injection site arm may take . Patients receive thermometer , diary card , plastic measuring device . Each day record temperatures symptom , measure size reaction vaccination site . They ask 27 day vaccination . After injection , may pain , swell , redness vaccination site , limitation arm movement . General side effect vaccine may fever , chill , headache , fatigue , muscle joint pain . Patients ask agree researcher keep unused serum sample , use research malaria diseases . Genetic test would do sample . Stored sample label code , information keep private .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AMA1-C1 Montanide ISA 720 , blood stage malaria vaccine candidate . The objective phase 1 trial study safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity vaccine ass level , kinetics , vitro biological activity antibody response induces . The study open label , dose escalation , phase 1 clinical trial healthy adult volunteer . Volunteers screen 28 participant enrol 3 dose cohort . Cohort 1 receive 5 microgram AMA1-C1/ISA 720 injection , Cohort 2 receive 20 microgram , Cohort 3 receive 80 microgram . Cohorts 1 2 receive 2 injection , 3 month apart . Cohort 3 receive 1 vaccination . Safety outcome measure local systemic ( include laboratory ) adverse event . Immune responses vaccination measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) parasite growth inhibition assay ( GIA ) , compare among dose group .</detailed_description>
