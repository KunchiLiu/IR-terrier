	<brief_summary>Left myocardial infarction ( MI ) , negative impact long term morbidity mortality . Even patient treat successfully angioplasty acute phase infarct , remodelling observe approximately 30 % case . It important predict occurrence phenomenon early phase MI selection patient could eventually benefit new therapeutic approach example cell replacement therapy . It advocate stem cell coronary injection perform 5th 10th day acute event . We hypothesise low dose dobutamine gate Tc-99m-mibi SPECT perform 5th-6th day reperfused acute MI predict leave ventricular remodelling serve method screen patient could benefit cell replacement therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Dobutamine Tc-99m-Mibi Gated SPECT Predict Left Ventricular Remodelling Patients Reperfused Acute Phase MI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient evaluate ce-MRI initial hospital stay ( 5th - 6th day ) 6-month follow-up . Left ventricular remodelling define end-diastolic volume increase &gt; 20 % two exam . A low dose dobutamine gate Tc-99m-mibi SPECT also perform 5th-6th day . Differences infarct size severity well residual inotrope reserve infarct area expect group without remodelling .</detailed_description>
