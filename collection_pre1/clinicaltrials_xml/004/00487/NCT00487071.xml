	<brief_title>Anal Fistula Plug High-type Anal Fistulae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An anal fistula abnormal communication anal rectal lumen perianal skin . Anal fistula describe accord level transgress anal sphincter . If internal opening begin anal sphincter fistula describe 'high ' . Traditional surgery high-type anal fistula often require stag operation fistulotomy seton insertion . The surgery usually result large deep wound take month heal . Moreover , risk faecal incontinence inevitable part anal sphincter divide surgery . The SurgisisÂ® anal fistula plug minimally invasive sphincter-preserving alternative traditional fistula surgery . It newly develop biomaterial make complex collagen obtain pig - animal collagen structure almost identical human tissue . During manufacture plug , live cell remove special process help ensure transmittable disease present tissue . The plug conical device place draw fistula tract suture place . As pig collagen similar human collagen , plug , implant , incorporate naturally time human tissue ( human cell tissue 'grow ' plug ) , thus facilitate closure fistula . Preliminary clinical data USA show high fistula closure rate 87 % . The anal fistula plug also avoid protracted postoperative wound care minimise risk faecal incontinence . We would like carry pilot study , aim evaluate efficacy safety new anal fistula plug management high-type anal fistula . This believe first study kind Hong Kong . Patients high-type anal fistula confirm MRI recruit study . Patients previous history fistula surgery , patient Crohn 's disease , patient know allergy porcine material exclude . EUA + anal fistula plug perform . Outcome measure include fistula heal rate , recurrence rate , morbidity . Follow-up MRI arrange 3 month 6 month operation objectively evaluate healing fistula .</detailed_description>
