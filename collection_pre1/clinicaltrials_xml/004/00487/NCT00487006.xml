	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Critical illness hyperglycemia ( CIH ) - elevate blood glucose critically ill patient population - gain much interest among health care provider past several year . Clinical study adult document high rate hyperglycemia post-surgical medical intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . However , primary reason interest topic due high rate , also fact return high glucose level find population normal insulin therapy dramatically improve clinical outcome decrease morbidity long-term mortality . Because , aggressive glucose control become common practice adult ICU critical care management . Although substantial data describe high incidence CIH adult patient , little information regard condition child . A single retrospective study recently publish also suggest high incidence CIH child critical illness secondary medical surgical cause . It yet determine , like adult , normalize blood glucose level insulin improve outcome pediatric population . Because evidence appear compelling hyperglycemia common detrimental adult , many pediatric ICUs likewise begin focus aggressively treat hyperglycemia critically ill child . The propose study prospective observational pilot study occur Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Egleston . This prospective pilot study do evaluate endocrine factor associate , responsible , CIH , change take place restoration normal blood glucose level insulin therapy . To address profound issue study pursue two interrelated Aims : Aim # 1 : To determine critical illness hyperglycemia associate absolute insulin deficiency , peripheral insulin resistance , . Aim # 2 : To characterize requirement insulin require initially restore maintain normal blood glucose level , compare change insulin take place normalization patient CIH . We hypothesize hyperglycemic response critical illness associate abnormally low level insulin compare patient without critical illness hyperglycemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SUMMARY OF PROCEDURES This approximately 12 month long , single center , prospective study patient age 2 12 year old meet criterion CIH pediatric intensive care unit period enrollment . Patients screen physicians staff evaluate via inclusion exclusion criterion , evaluation discuss family/legal guardian appoint critical care fellow , attend physician appointee , patient enrol informed consent grant . Following informed consent approval family/legal guardian , blood sample collect sent storage process clinical laboratory Children 's . Three patient population group assess study : - Group A - Study Patients - At risk CIH/with CIH Labs drawn target population diagnosis CIH send insulin C-peptide level . These level repeat 24 hour initiation insulin , follow every three day insulin longer need , repeat 24 hour insulin ( see protocol ) . - Group B - Control Patients - At risk CIH/without CIH Insulin C-peptide level draw control group patient risk factor without CIH time admission , 24 hour admission , 3 day . - Group C - Control Patients - Not risk CIH/without CIH The protocol lab schedule use second control group consist patient deem risk critical illness hyperglycemia . III . POTENTIAL RISKS Most patient meet criterion usually arterial line , central venous catheter , `` blood drawing '' IV . It rare separate venous puncture need collect sample . If blood collect , approximately 2cc per stick , believe negatively impact patient either patient clinical caretaker , blood drawn . Information collect study contain Protected Health Information ( PHI ) subject . There potential risk unintentional disclosure information . However , certain step follow study minimalize PHI disclosure help protect subject ' privacy confidentiality . Once collect , information keep database password protect limited access password-protected network . Other institution require law access research record , authorize research staff access research database associate study . Furthermore , data identifiable study subject , subject assign unique study number enter database . If publish present , identify feature provide . IV . POTENTIAL BENEFITS There may direct potential benefit subject participate study . However , information learn study may benefit patient future . V. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Inclusion : - All patient age 2 12 year age admit pediatric ICU meet criterion critical illness hyperglycemia ( ie : patient mechanical ventilation , patient vasoactive medication , patient deem otherwise `` risk '' CIH attend service ) start standard CIH screening treatment protocol comprise pool potential study candidate . Exclusion : - Certain patient meet criterion critical illness hyperglycemia thus start insulin exclude study : Age Patients le 2 great 12 year age exclude study decrease age variability . Pre-existing known endocrine disorder Patients know suspect Type 1 diabetes exclude pre-existing absolute lack insulin production secondary autoimmune β cell destruction . Oncology patient Oncology patient exclude effect immunosuppressant study marker . Renal replacement therapy Patients continuous veno-venous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) type dialysis ( intermittent dialysis , peritoneal dialysis ) exclude unclear different form renal replacement therapy affect insulin level , certain type dialysis affect glucose insulin level ( i.e . dextrose contain PD fluid ) . Non-adherence Inability unwillingness legal guardian provide consent , unwillingness child provide assent . VI . INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS Patients consider eligible study discretion pediatric intensivists appointee ( i.e . pediatric critical care fellows nurse practitioner ) . There discussion family background information , reason conduct study , risk involve . At time study opportunity remove study without impact care . After question answer , write informed consent obtain parent ( legal guardian ) , sign intensivist appointee . If parent/subject decides participate , child continue standard care procedure originally plan without test . As part ongoing informed consent process , whenever appropriate , subject participate study provide additional pertinent information initial time consent .</detailed_description>
