	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether use drug elute stent associate high rate death , myocardial infarction , major bleeding . In addition , overall economic cost implant drug elute stent compare bare metal stent assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Study Impact Drug Eluting Stents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major limitation percutaneous coronary stenting compare coronary artery bypass graft surgery significantly high need repeat revascularization due restenosis occur near stent site . By elute potent anti-proliferative agent polymer coat stent time-controlled manner , possible markedly inhibit intimal proliferation result implantation bare metal stent , dramatically reduce need future target lesion revascularization . Recent angioscopic autopsy study demonstrate markedly delayed incomplete endothelialization follow drug-eluting stent implantation . These event rarely observe follow bare metal stent implantation . In addition , drug-eluting stent associate hypersensitivity reaction , may predispose patient subacute thrombosis . Finally , serial intra-coronary ultrasound study demonstrate late stent mal-apposition , believe create possible nidus thrombus formation . By mean examine several extensive administrative database , study retrospectively examine approximately 9,800 consecutive patient underwent either bare metal drug elute coronary artery stenting Sacred Heart Medical Center , Spokane , WA March 1 , 2001 March 30 , 2006 . Time frame follow-up least 18 month . Comparison : The strategy implant stent three time period compare . In first study period occur prior commercial release Cypher drug elute stent , patient receive bare metal stent . The second study group include patient time frame release Cypher stent Taxus drug elute stent ( approximately one year ) contractual decision make utilize Taxus stent . During second time frame correspond availability Cypher stent , 30 % total stent case receive drug elute stent predominately `` label '' indication . The third study group occur time-frame Taxus drug elute stent implant 90 % overall patient include many `` label '' indication .</detailed_description>
