	<brief_summary>This trial prospective , multi-center , randomized study patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) mild moderate leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction . The primary objective study test hypothesis Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) therapy combination medical therapy patient infarct size great equal 10 % leave ventricular mass improve long term survival compare medical therapy alone .

	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : The utilization ICD therapy result significant reduction mortality among high risk sudden cardiac death , survivor cardiac arrest patient present symptomatic sustain ventricular arrhythmia . Patients CAD advance LV dysfunction ( EF &lt; 35 % ) also benefit ICD . However , although high risk , patient represent small percentage population die suddenly . While many test use stratification risk sudden cardiac death , two document clinical utility determination leave ventricular ejection fraction presence inducibility ventricular tachycardia program electrical stimulation perform part EP testing . The utility test likely result ability select patient requisite substrate allow sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias . It show ventricular tachycardia occur commonly set large infarct . Ejection fraction relate infarct size ; presumably , large area infarction , low ejection fraction . Electrophysiologic test directly establish presence substrate actual induction ventricular tachycardia . A major limitation electrophysiologic program stimulation high number false negative finding . Thus , significant number patient without inducible arrhythmia remain risk . CE-MRI provide functional information ( EF , LV Volumes , LV mass , etc ) , routine initial evaluation post-MI patient , addition provide detailed geometry scar tissue . There clear association inducible arrhythmia scar size development cardiac MRI , could see human . Use cardiac MRI demonstrate although patient large MI inducible , small significant number patient , remain risk , inducible . There also association death infarct size patient cardiovascular risk factor establish CAD . The Center Medicare Services ( CMS ) recently decide coverage decision patient leave ventricular dysfunction , heart failure , ejection fraction &lt; 35 % would eligible receive ICD long enrol prospective registry . Patients LV ejection fraction great 35 % without heart failure ejection fraction 30 % , represent difficult management dilemma . However , since majority hospital cardiac arrest occur patient EF &gt; 35 % , managing patient crucial address epidemiologic problem sudden cardiac death . The primary objective trial test hypothesis therapy ICD combine medical therapy improve long-term survival compare medical therapy alone patient CAD , infarct mass great equal 10 % leave ventricle leave ventricular dysfunction indication ICD either follow criterion . Patients must EF &gt; 35 % EF 30-35 % must inducible ventricular tachycardia NYHA Class II great heart failure ( Target Population ) . The secondary objective test hypothesis therapy ICD combine medical therapy improve arrhythmic survival compare medical therapy alone patient CAD , infarct mass great equal 10 % leave ventricular dysfunction indication ICD base Target Population describe . Recruitment : All patient history coronary heart disease ( CAD ) documentation either myocardial infarction ( MI ) leave ventricular dysfunction ( LVD ) , preliminary ejection fraction ( EF ) &gt; 35 % previously undergone contrast-enhanced MRI ( CE-MRI ) study clinical diagnostic reason part study entry screen procedure may evaluate eligibility trial . In addition , patient ejection fraction 30-35 % may eligible study currently indication ICD base Target Population criterion describe . These patient may NYHA Class I heart failure , non-sustained VT holter monitor , non-sustained VT present , absence inducible VT EP study . The first 1550 patient find EF &gt; 30 % NYHA Class I heart failure 35 % routine clinical evaluation also MI involve great equal 10 % total leave ventricular mass enrol main randomized portion trial . These patient randomly assign one two group : ICD therapy combination medical therapy ( ICD Group ) medical therapy alone ( Control Group ) . Follow-Up : Clinic visit require every 6 month completion study . Telephone contact require every six month ass vital status obtain new information regard medical status and/or medical event . The telephone call alternate clinical visit , patient contact occur every 3 month completion study . Non-Investigational Registry : The primary objective registry sub-study test hypothesis infarct mass measure contrast enhance Cardiac MRI ( CE-MRI ) good predictor sudden cardiac death LV ejection fraction . The registry examine infarct mass measure Cardiac MRI LV ejection fraction ( EF ) predictor SCD . The purpose registry hypothesis generate labeling indication anticipate base registry finding . Participation Registry require patient undergone contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI prior enrollment . In order ensure consistent infarct mass assessment , cardiac MRI study submit determine eligibility randomization must meet following criterion : 1 . CE-cardiac MRIs must obtain use Siemens , General Electric Phillips equipment . 2 . The contrast agent must gadolinium-based dose sufficient render image acceptable quality . 3 . The CE-cardiac MRI must available electronic submission MRI Core laboratory analysis . If technique infarct mass measurement data acquisition change course trial , Core laboratory Steering Committee may choose alter parameter . Once consent participate registry obtain , site forward CE-MRI study CE-MRI core lab analysis determine placement appropriate registry , baseline demographic characteristic collect registry patient . This aid statistical analysis verify generalizability finding . The difference total survival group also compare use methodology primary end-point . Patients without ICD implant compare separately . In addition , blood specimen genetic sample biomarker test obtain patient registry cohort agree , determine SCD substrate exist DETERMINE registry population . Study subject contact mail Endpoint Coordinating Center Brigham Women 's Hospital Boston every 6 month determine vital status obtain new information regard change medical status occurrence medical event . This promote continue relationship study participant enrol center also use remind study subject next schedule appointment . Scope Duration trial : - Up 100 site screen total 10,000 patient enroll 1550 patient randomize study recruit total 10,000 patient contribute data CE-MRI image registry . - Registry enrollment per site = ~90 subject - Randomization per site = 1-3 per month ( expect randomize enrollment per site 20 patient ) - Estimated enrollment period : 36 month - 24 month follow-up last patient randomize</detailed_description>
