	<detailed_description>This study patient breast , prostate , ovarian , non-small cell lung ( NSCL ) bladder cancer fail potentially curative treatment whose disease curative treatment exist . OGX-427 second-generation ASO inhibit expression Hsp27 . Hsp27 one heat shock protein . Hsp27 increase cell stress , include cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation therapy hormone therapy show inhibit cell death . Thus , decrease Hsp27 cancer therapy attractive therapy result regulation pathway implicate cancer progression development resistance treatment . A number vitro vivo pharmacological study demonstrate OGX-427 single-agent activity reduce Hsp27 , inhibit cell growth induce cell death several human cancer cell line . OGX-427 also demonstrate chemosensitizing activity study use cell line animal model combination several cytotoxic drug , include docetaxel . Docetaxel ( Taxotere® ) anticancer activity breast , prostate , ovarian , non-small cell lung bladder cancer . Docetaxel approve Health Canada Food Drug Administration treatment patient breast , prostate , ovarian non-small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
