	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare safety immune activity three dos tumor vaccine . In recent year , researcher Dana-Farber Cancer Institute discover vaccine make patient 's cancer cell , engineer laboratory produce protein call GM-CSF , effective stimulating powerful immune response specific cancer . GM-CSF naturally occur hormone body help immune system fight infection disease . One goal study determine whether vaccination improve immune system 's ability recognize destroy participant 's lymphoma cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination Treatment Previously Untreated Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The dose vaccine depend upon many participant 's tumor cell available point join study . This Phase I trial `` dose escalation '' study . This mean participant enrol group . Group 2 receive large dose Group 1 . Group 3 receive large dose Group 2 . - The vaccine administer injection skin six time . Participants receive vaccination shot weekly 3 vaccine , every week 3 vaccine . - After first fifth vaccination , small amount participant lymphoma cell ( kill ) inject skin see immune system react cause redness swell . A punch skin biopsy also perform injection location . - During course study , also draw blood evaluate immune cell effect vaccination participant immune system . During treatment cycle physical exam question participant general health perform . - After final treatment ( approximately week 10 ) participant undergo `` re-staging '' ass status disease . If completion six vaccine , evaluation participant 's disease reveal stable respond vaccine , still vaccine available , may eligible continue receive vaccine every two week supply run . - After completion vaccination , participant come back physical exam blood test every 3 month 1 year year fifteen year monitor effect vaccine .</detailed_description>
