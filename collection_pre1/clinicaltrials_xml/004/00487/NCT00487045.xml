	<brief_title>Prevention and/or Reduction Hemorrhoids and/or Thrombosed External Hemorrhoids Using HEM-AVERT Perianal Stabilizer Instrument</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct evaluate investigational instrument call HEM-AVERT™ Perianal Stabilizer efficacy reduce occurrence severity hemorrhoid thrombose external hemorrhoid ( TEH ) . Hemorrhoids TEH cause blood pooling distend vein forming clot , thrombose , out region anus . An anal fissure small split tear anal mucosa may result painful bowel movement bleed . Like hemorrhoid , anal fissure common woman childbirth . Lacerations grade first , second , third fourth degree . First second degree perineal laceration involve mucosa perineum usually heal . First second degree laceration consider normal occurrence child birth . Third degree laceration involve anal sphincter fourth degree laceration involve sphincter mucosa anus bowel involvement usually require surgical repair . Per product classification assign instrument FDA , instrument non-invasive posse non-significant risk . It classify manual , general instrument specific indication , general indication stabilizing pressure . The purpose clinical study collect data support 510 ( k ) application obtain specific indication prevent occurrence hemorrhoid , reduce severity hemorrhoid often occur vaginal delivery . Hemorrhoids TEH represent common adverse event vaginal birth report occurrence range low 9 % high 34 % report literature . Currently preventative treatment exists . There two study group ; investigational group ( subject receive HEM-AVERT™ instrument ) control group ( subject receive HEM-AVERT™ instrument ) . The HEM-AVERT™ Perianal Stabilizer Class 1 , exempt device accordance FDA regulation 21 CFR 890.5765 . The HEM-AVERT™ non-invasive instrument use provide continuous pressure perianal region mean help provide support labor process . Each HEM-AVERT™ instrument single use , disposable , sterile , individually package instrument . The HEM-AVERT™ instrument consist three component : 1 ) rigid polymer base manufacture medical grade polycarbonate ; 2 ) centrally locate cushion pad compose laminate medical grade polyester non-woven tape medical grade polyethylene foam tape ; 3 ) two lateral hook loop fastener adhesive strip ( liner ) ( `` loop '' strip attach mat `` hook '' [ similar VELCRO® ] ) use provide tension need keep instrument firmly place delivery . The cushion pad adhesive strip manufacture use material commonly find medical instrument use medical procedure . All material use manufacture instrument meet available national international standard specification apply instrument . This instrument implant .</detailed_description>
