	<brief_summary>The goal proposal test overall hypothesis subject chronic recurrent low back pain abnormal soft tissue response acupuncture needling , alter response associate abnormal perimuscular connective tissue structure biomechanics . We also test whether alter needling response low back pain generalize , localize specific location predict traditional acupuncture theory . This proposal part series project investigate role connective tissue mechanism acupuncture , addition , constitute first step examine role connective tissue low back pain . Acupuncturists describe qualitatively different needle response location believe `` involve '' patient 's disease process . Although assess abnormality needle response fundamental aspect acupuncture therapy , constitute normal vs. abnormal needle response never study quantitatively . Thus nature tissue change underlie phenomenon remain unknown . We recently develop new vivo technique base ultrasound elastography allow visualization quantification tissue displacement strain pattern develop tissue needle manipulation human [ 1 ] ( Appendix A ) . In proposal , use ultrasound elastography , ultrasound image analysis biomechanical modeling perform 1 ) quantitative measurement soft tissue behavior needle 2 ) detail analysis perimuscular connective tissue structure biomechanics human subject without low back pain .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion LBP subject follow : 1 . History recurrent chronic LBP define Von Korff { Von Korff , 1992 # 6777 } { Von Korff , 1994 # 6816 } minimum 12 month 2 . Able stand walk without assistance 3 . Able understand read English 4 . Able understand sign consent form . Subjects ' LBP define recurrent chronic LPB base number day symptoms period one year . Recurrent LBP define back pain present less ½ day 12month period , occur multiple episode year . Chronic LBP define back pain present least ½ day 12month period single multiple episode . Inclusion criterion NoLBP subject : Criteria select NoLBP subject : 1 . No history low back pain chronic pain limited activity daily live work 2 . A numerical current pain index less 0.5 . NoLBP subject match age , sex subcutaneous tissue thickness LBP subject . For subject , exclusion criterion determine history physical exam follow : 1 . Previous severe back low extremity injury surgery 2 . Major structural spinal deformity ( scoliosis , kyphosis , stenosis ) 3 . Ankylosing spondylitis rheumatoid arthritis 4 . Spondyloarthropathy disc herniation 5 . Spinal fracture , tumor infection 6 . Neurological deficit ( weakness and/or sensory loss , decrease deep tendon reflex suggest nerve root compression , subjective symptom nerve root irritation ( sciatica ) 7 . Neurological major psychiatric disorder 8 . Bleeding disorder 9 . Corticosteroid anticoagulant medication 10 . Pregnancy 11. worker 's compensation disability case 12 . In litigation LBP problem 13 . Acute systemic infection 14 . BMI great 23 % le 32 % . Preliminary test show individual BMI le 23 % insufficient depth subcutaneous fat zone ( Zone P ) data processing . Individuals BMI great 32 % subcutaneous fat zone ( Zone P ) thickness great acupuncture needle length , allow penetration muscle layer ( Zone M ) . 15 . Subjects need take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory ( NSAIDs ) medication 3 day prior test order avoid potentially confound acute effect NSAIDs connective tissue . 16 . In addition , LBP subject exclude acute flareup LBP . Flareup define short period ( less one week ) pain markedly severe usual individual ( least 5 point baseline pain index ) .</criteria>
