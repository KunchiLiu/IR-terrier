	<brief_summary>Surgery induces stress effect body partially catabolic energy state . In turn , glucose level may rise level associate major morbidity ( Golden , 1999 ) mortality ( Ouattara , 2005 ) . An increase body evidence suggest intensive insulin therapy tight control blood glucose level certain surgical critical care patient population may improve mortality select morbidity outcome compare patient receive conventional insulin therapy blood glucose management . More specifically , poor intra-operative blood glucose control associate bad outcome cardiac surgery . Intensive insulin therapy tight blood glucose control surgical patient ICU may reduce morbidity mortality . Such outcome improvement would clearly provide benefit patient , provider payer . To date , scant research examine whether intensive insulin therapy tight control blood glucose perioperative period alter outcome non cardiac surgery population . The purpose study determine whether intensive insulin therapy tight control blood glucose perioperative period non cardiac major surgery patient associate altered morbidity mortality rate .</brief_summary>

Benefits glucose control may result prevention immune system dysfunction , reduction systemic inflammation , protection endothelium mitochondrial structure function , know altered high stress state induce surgical procedure . In prospective , randomize , control study adult patient admit operate suite non-emergent non-cardiac surgery , propose correlate in-hospital morbidity mortality blood glucose level patient expect moderate high level physiologic stress result pre-existing medical condition result propose surgical procedure . Specifically , patient deem American Society Anesthesiologists Risk Classification 1-3 high , patient undergo intermediate high risk procedure shall consider moderate high physiologic stress . Determination intermediate / high risk procedure shall accord American College Cardiology / American Heart Association 2002 Guidelines Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation Noncardiac Surgery outline Table 1 . Table 1 . Cardiac Event Risk Stratification Noncardiac Surgical Procedures High ( Reported cardiac risk often &gt; 5 % ) - Emergent major operation , particularly elderly - Aortic major vascular surgery - Peripheral vascular surgery - Anticipated prolonged surgical procedure associate large fluid shift and/or blood loss Combined incidence cardiac death nonfatal myocardial infarction . Further preoperative cardiac test generally require . Intermediate ( Reported cardiac risk generally &lt; 5 % ) - Intraperitoneal intrathoracic surgery - Carotid endarterectomy surgery - Head neck surgery - Orthopedic surgery - Prostate surgery Low ( Reported cardiac risk generally &lt; 1 % ) : - Endoscopic procedure - Superficial procedure - Cataract surgery - Breast surgery Prior enter operate suite surgery , patient randomly assign receive either intensive insulin treatment conventional insulin treatment .

In patient , whole blood hemoglobin A1C glucose level draw prior induction anesthesia . Additional whole blood glucose level draw time induction anesthesia , skin incision , hourly throughout operation , emergence anesthesia , every hour three hour completion surgery , per day patient discharge hospital . In intensive treatment group , continuous insulin infusion ( 50 IU Novolin R [ Novo Nordisk ] ) 50mL 0.9 % saline via infusion pump start blood glucose level exceed 110 mg/dL adjust maintain blood glucose level 80 110 mg/dL . Adjustments make accord University Hospital 's ICU Adult Insulin Infusion Protocol . When blood glucose level fall 80 mg/dL , insulin infusion taper discontinue . For patient go ICU surgery , insulin infusion continue accord University Hospital 's ICU Adult Insulin Infusion Protocol direction ICU staff . For patient ICU surgery , insulin infusion taper final hourly blood glucose determination three hour completion surgery . The University Hospital 's Blood Glucose Management Order Set Medical Surgical Patients adopt continue glucose management . In conventional treatment group , continuous insulin infusion start blood glucose level exceed 200 mg/dL adjust maintain blood glucose level 180 200 mg/dL . Adjustments make accord modified ICU Adult Insulin Infusion Protocol . When blood glucose level fall 180mg/dL , insulin infusion taper discontinue . For patient transfer ICU surgery , insulin infusion continue accord University Hospital 's ICU Adult Insulin Infusion Protocol direction ICU staff . For patient transfer ICU surgery , insulin infusion taper final hourly blood glucose determination three hour completion surgery . The University Hospital 's Blood Glucose Management Order Set Medical Surgical Patients adopt continue glucose management . How study analyze ? At baseline , data demographic clinical characteristic patient ( see Table 1 ) obtain . Blood systematically sample whole blood glucose level determine describe . All blood glucose value tabulate baseline end study . A research associate blind treatment group determine morbidity mortality review patient 's medical record upon discharge hospital record occurrence morbidity mortality follow criterion : 1 . Post-operative surgical wound infection - clinical condition require antibiotic treatment beyond UH Surgical Infection Prevention ( SIP ) protocol / subsequent wound drainage / debridement 2 . Systemic infection - presence bacteremia prolong ( i.e . great 10 day ) use antibiotic 3 . Myocardial Injury - postoperative EKG change reveal new Q wave S-T segment elevation great 1mm lead ( ) serum troponin level exceedâ€¦ . 4 . Malignant arrhythmia - asystole , ventricular tachycardia fibrillation require cardiopulmonary resuscitation , antiarrhythmia therapy , defibrillator implantation 5 . Respiratory Injury - mechanical ventilation 48 hour , reintubation , plan tracheostomy 6 . Neurological Injury - focal brain injury permanent functional deficit , irreversible encephalopathy 7 . Renal Injury - level serum creatinine twice present admission hospital acute renal failure require dialysis 8 . Hepatic Injury - bilirubin level &gt; 3mg per deciliter 9 . Venous Thromboembolism - deposition thrombus peripheral central vein determine Doppler ultrasonography , angiography compute tomography .</detailed_description>
