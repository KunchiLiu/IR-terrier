	<brief_summary>The aim study validate ability Capsule Endoscopy ( CE ) accurately diagnose small bowel ( SB ) Crohns disease patient symptoms abdominal pain diarrhea . The primary objective study evaluate whether Capsule Endoscopy prior colonoscopy improve diagnosis patient suspect Crohns disease compare standard diagnostic testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Capsule Endoscopy Patients With Suspected Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease chronic , inflammatory disorder ( IBD ) affect part gastrointestinal tract frequently involve small large bowel . ( 1,2,3 ) Typical presenting symptom include abdominal pain diarrhea . ( 1,2,3 ) Patients disorder may also extraintestinal manifestation include arthritis , uveitis aphthous stomatitis , erythema nodosum pyoderma gangrenosum . ( 1,2 ) The etiology Crohn 's disease unknown . It affect population around globe occur age predilection affect age 15 35 . ( 1,2,3,4 ) While one half patient involvement ileum large bowel , another third disease isolate small bowel . ( 1,2 ) Frequently , small bowel Crohn 's disease difficult diagnose use traditional method evaluation include colonoscopy ileoscopy contrast radiography . ( 1,2 ) Mucosal feature Crohn 's disease often subtle difficult identify small bowel follow ( SBFT ) . The SBFT traditionally rely evaluate small intestine evidence Crohn 's disease show relatively low accuracy 30 % . ( 5,6,7,8,9 , ) This lead delay diagnosis Crohn 's disease report range one three year . ( 7,8,9 ) In past year , capsule endoscopy spark renew interest investigation IBD Crohn 's disease small bowel . A PillCam™ SB2 capsule ( Given Imaging Ltd , Yoqneam , Israel ) ingestible , disposable video camera transmit high quality image small intestinal mucosa . This enable small intestine readily accessible physician investigate presence small bowel disorder past inaccessible physician . ( 7,9,10,11,12 ) A number small pilot study demonstrate capsule endoscopy efficacy diagnose SB Crohn 's disease . Diagnostic yield 70 % report small series study perform suspect small bowel Crohn 's disease . ( 9,10,11,12 ) This study design determine yield clinical impact Capsule Endoscopy detect suspect IBD suspect Crohn 's Disease small bowel compare SBFT . ( 6,7,8,9,10 )</detailed_description>
