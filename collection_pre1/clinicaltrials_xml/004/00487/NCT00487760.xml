	<brief_summary>This study learn belief family member African American patient lung cancer whether belief associate interest genetic test disease risk willingness participate genetics research . Lung cancer second common form cancer lead cause cancer death men woman United States . Like cancer , racial ethnic disparity ( gap ) lung cancer case death . The age-adjusted rate black white ( year 2000 2003 ) 76.9 per 100,000 66.0 per 100,000 , respectively . Mortality rate 62.5 per 100,000 black 55.3 per 100,000 white . Cigarette smoke preventable cause lung cancer . Findings African Americans begin smoke old age smoke few cigarette per day Caucasian Americans . Yet severity lung cancer great African Americans . Behavioral , social , environmental , genetic factor may explain difference . Participants ( subject ) age 18 55 family patient lung cancer self-identify African Americans may eligible study . Washington , D.C. , researcher plan recruit 115 lung cancer patient 200 family members-100 current smoker 100 never smoke . Lung cancer patient , must bear United States , recruit receive care Washington Cancer Institute Washington Hospital Center . They ask list relative friends consider close family . Patients ask permission researcher contact people . Family member receive letter tell unless decline participate , contact telephone interviewer . The survey feature question evaluate family member ' explanation cause lung cancer , well reaction possible reason disparity lung cancer African Americans Caucasian Americans . Subjects ask perceived personal risk , worry develop lung cancer , smoke history , motivation quit smoking , feeling lung cancer patient 's diagnosis , racial identify , experience racial discrimination , pros con genetic testing , interest genetic testing . The survey take 20 minute complete . This study may may direct benefit participate . However , lung cancer patient family offer free self-help guide stop smoking . They refer local smoking cessation program . Knowledge gain study may use design smoke cessation method research study relate genetics minority population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose African American ( AA ) Families Lung Cancer Study learn ( 1 ) belief family member AA patient lung cancer AA get lung cancer ( 2 ) whether belief associate interest genetic test lung cancer risk willingness participate clinical genetics research . We plan recruit 200 AAs ( n = 100 current smoker n = 100 never smoker ) consider close family ( biological non-biological kin ) patient lung cancer self-identify AA ( n = 115 ) . Patients recruit Washington Cancer Institute Washington Hospital Center Washington , DC . Family member self-identify AA age 18 55 eligible study . A Washington Hospital Center recruiter approach patient ask willingness contact telephone survey general well-being . As part survey , patient ask enumerate family friend consider close family , ask specifically focus current cigarette smoker never smoke . Patients ask give permission contact enumerate . These family member mail letter inform unless call decline contact telephone interviewer . The survey include question assess family member ' explanation cause lung cancer reaction possible explanation disparity lung cancer AA Caucasian Americans ( CA ) , perceive personal risk worry develop lung cancer , smoke history , motivation quit smoking , emotional response patient 's diagnosis , racial identity , experience racial discrimination , pros con genetic testing , interest genetic testing ( primary outcome variable ) . Data analysis use hierarchical linear model ass whether patient characteristic family member ' endorsement genetics cause lung cancer associate interest genetic test participation clinical genetics research .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients : In order include study , patient lung cancer must meet inclusion criterion 2 step : ( 1 ) initial screen write consent contact telephone , ( 2 ) provision verbal consent time telephone contact complete survey . Step 1a : In order approach study , patient must ( 1 ) least 18 year age , ( 2 ) diagnose lung cancer stage ( Stages IaIV ) , ( 3 ) approve contact oncologist , ( 4 ) identify recruiter identify medical record Black . Step 1b : In order provide consent contact telephone survey , patient must selfidentify AA/Black must bear U.S. Also , patient must willing give permission contact least one family member friend consider close family current cigarette smoker age 18 55 order provide consent . Step 2 : At point patient survey , patient ask race/ethnicity . All patient selfidentify AA/Black define research administer patient survey . Family : Family member must selfidentify AA age 18 55 eligible study . Family also must meet follow inclusion criterion classify either current smoker ( define ) never smoker ( define ) . These criterion current smoker never smoker base standard criterion use smoke research . Current Smoker : included smoker , family member must report smoke least 100 cigarette lifetime , smoke 7 cigarette past 7 day time family member survey .
