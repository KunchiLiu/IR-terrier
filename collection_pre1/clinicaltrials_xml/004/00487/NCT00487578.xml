	<brief_title>Naratriptan Treatment Post Traumatic Headache Associated With Cognitive Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Naratriptan demonstrate efficacy relieve headache . Other study demonstrate primary headache least one headache feature likely respond triptans . In addition , anecdotal report triptans effective post traumatic headache , especially headache feature note patient 's history . Further , several small pilot study triptans demonstrate prompt improvement headache-induced cognitive change . Cognitive performance measure Mental Efficiency Workload Test ( MEWT ) , handheld Palm neuropsychological test battery measure mental efficiency . This tool use demonstrate short long term improvement mental status beyond see baseline . Informal observation protocol author suggest use triptans routine basis may ameliorate headache associate symptomatology post traumatic headache . Therefore , study undertaken study use naratriptan treatment post traumatic headache . Roger K. Cady , MD , serve sponsor . The study fund GlaxoSmithKline . 56 subject formal diagnosis Chronic post-traumatic headache attribute mild head injury ( IHS/ICHD-II 5.2.2 ) self-reported mild cognitive inefficiency secondary headache enrol . Subjects meet inclusion criterion complete physical examination baseline test randomize 1:1 naratriptan 2.5mg bid x 30 day match placebo bid x 30 day . A daily diary document response treatment . Subjects return clinic Day 10 Day 30 complete phone contact Days 5 , 15 , 21 , 32 90 . Information collect throughout study questionnaire relate headache impact , general health , satisfaction medication , quality life . Cognition measure use MEWT .</detailed_description>
