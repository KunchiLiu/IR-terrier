	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , single-arm , single-institution , open label , two-stage phase II dose-ranging study design evaluate efficacy safety paclitaxel poliglumex combination pemetrexed patient advanced stage IIIB stage IV NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Combination Paclitaxel Poliglumex Alimta Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective To evaluate overall response rate ( complete plus partial response RECIST criterion ) combination paclitaxel poliglumex pemetrexed therapy patient advance NSCLC . Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety adverse event profile combination paclitaxel poliglumex pemetrexed therapy patient advance NSCLC . To evaluate duration response , time progression , overall survival advance NSCLC treat combination paclitaxel poliglumex pemetrexed . To compare overall response rate use three-dimensional reconstruction target lesion Medical Metrx Solutions ( MMS ) RECIST criterion .</detailed_description>
