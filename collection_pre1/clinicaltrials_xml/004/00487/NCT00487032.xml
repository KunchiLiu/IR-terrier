	<brief_summary>The investigator wish evaluate onset tolerance nasal decongestant like oxymetazoline ( available counter ) mechanism tolerance particularly differential effect alpha 1 alpha 2 adrenoreceptors nose . The investigator 'tease ' use alpha 1 blocker call Prazosin . The investigator hypothesize alpha 1 receptor mediate arterial constriction capture measure nasal blood flow . The investigator also hypothesize alpha 2 receptor mediate venous sinusoid constriction investigator capture airflow parameter like Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow , Rhinomanometry , Oscillometric indices etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis affect upto 25 % worldwide population associate asthma . Furthermore , nonallergic rhinitis account 50 % Rhinitis sufferer . Patients Allergic Rhinitis , Nonallergic Rhinitis Common cold nasal blockage principal symptom . Nasal blockage affect sleep quality impairs daytime performance . It major cause sickness absenteeism show adversely affect quality life . The efficacious class drug symptom nasal decongestant ( sympathomimetics act alpha receptor ) . Unfortunately prolonged use spray result condition tolerance ( reduced efficacy ) , rebound nasal congestion nasal hyperreactivity call Rhinitis Medicamentosa . It poorly understood condition mechanism action unclear . What also clear time onset tolerance . Finally many research study demonstrate use nasal spray many week result side effect . Although evidence conflicting , vitro study show adrenoreceptors know develop tolerance within day agonist use . Moreover beta adrenoreceptors lung upregulated ( i.e. , tolerance reverse ) use corticosteroid . We also see many year clinical practise concomitant use steroid spray decongestant result tolerance rebound . Finally , research show rebound congestion treat stop decongestant spray start steroid spray . We study rebound congestion take year decongestant abuse develop . What would like demonstrate onset tolerance ( precedes rebound ) reversal steroid . We would also find one two alpha receptor responsible , may lead selective alpha 1 alpha 2 agonist use safely nose.We , therefore propose conduct proof concept study evaluate onset tolerance nasal decongestant Oxymetazoline ( OXY , differential effect alpha 1 alpha 2 adrenoreceptors alpha 1 blocker Prazosin finally reversal process intranasal steroid ( Fluticasone ) . We recruit 31 patient ( 38 complete 31 ) accord previous research study PNIF outcome measure true difference two arm 10L/min . There would total 7 visit Asthma Allergy group Ninewells Hospital , Dundee Perth Royal Infirmary . Healthy Volunteers 18−65 year age attend screen visit . Their Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow ( PNIF ) must 100L/min ( best three ) . All patient satisfy inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion include trial . They issue Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow diary symptom diary . This record home morning 20 min use nasal spray repeat bedtime . They issue Oxymetazoline nasal spray use accord recommend dose 2 squirt nostril three time daily ( use upto four time daily ) , wake , lunch bedtime . The first visit include baseline nasal blood flow airflow test . The order test follow : Firstly , nasal peak inspiratory flow ( PNIF ) , secondly , active anterior rhinomanometry , thirdly , nasal impulse oscillometry , finally , nasal blood flow use Laser Doppler Flowmetry . They also lying/standing blood pressure measurement . This follow administration 1mg oral Prazosin/Placebo supine position . 3 hour later dose response curve ( DRC ) construct OXY 20 minute interval use cumulative sequential dos 50 µg [ 1 squirt ] , 100 µg [ + 1 squirt ] 200 µg per nostril [ + 2 squirt ] .After 1st dose 2nd dose , PNIF Rhinomanometry perform 10 minute dose administration . After last dose , order test PNIF , active anterior rhinomanometry , nasal impulse oscillometry , laser Doppler flowmetry . For first 2 hour lying/standing BP measure ½ hourly interval ; hourly thereafter . They ask lie till end visit ( 4 hour ) postural drop blood pressure record whichever come first . There rarely drop blood pressure give Prazosin call 'First Dose Hypotension ' . This happen hypertensive patient take high dose alpha blocker like Prazosin . Therefore British National Formulary advise patient give dose say 0.5 milligrammes thrice daily first dose bedtime slowly increase upto maximum daily dose 20 milligrammes . We within dose range . Moreover , clinical practise , dose upto 5 milligrammes prescribe previous research trial upto 10 milligrammes give Healthy Volunteers less risk first dose effect . Moreover , accord previous pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study within 4−6 hour Prazosin effect Blood Pressure wane . Therefore would conduct Prazosin challenge test OXY dose response supine position patient discharge till postural BP change within normal limit . Laser Doppler Flowmetry noninvasive test design measure blood flow nose . Rhinomanometry another noninvasive test measure nasal resistance flow . Oscillometry another parameter measure Rhinomanometry machine itself.PNIF noninvasive measure airflow basically peak flow meter reverse . Thus invasive measure use . This order test perform Day 1 repeat Day 14 compare acute chronic agonist use . On day 14 Fluticasone nasal spray 2 squirt twice daily issue Day 17 order test perform . As cross study patient receive placebo prazosin second arm follow week washout . The procedure Prazosin/Placebo challenge follow throughout .</detailed_description>
