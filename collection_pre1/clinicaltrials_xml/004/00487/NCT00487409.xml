	<brief_summary>The purpose research compare two different standard care surgical method follow large bowel ( colon ) procedure : laparoscopic right colectomy , total colectomy , leave colectomy . The study compare electrocautery , use surgical clip and/or surgical stapler , Ligasure vessel sealer .

	<detailed_description>The application laparoscopic surgery expand last decade include many complex abdominal procedure traditionally perform laparotomic incision . The widespread acceptance utilization laparoscopy directly result continue need develop new technique ancillary surgical instrumentation . Laparoscopic instrument provide adequate hemostasis allow precise dissection tissue need safe efficient operation . Furthermore , new device emerge volume laparoscopic case increase importance cost ergonomically sound instrumentation become apparent . The safety efficacy laparoscopic colectomy benign disease demonstrate several case series last decade . The advantage small wound , short ileus , early resumption dietary intake , reduction hospital stay consistently report major benefit approach . More recently , multi-center randomize prospective trial laparoscopic colectomy curable cancer result equivalent cancer relate survival open colectomy perform experienced surgeon . Adherence standard cancer resection technique include limited complete exploration abdomen , adequate proximal distal margin , ligation major vessel respective origin , containment careful tissue handling , en bloc resection negative tumor margin use laparoscopic approach result acceptable outcome . The advantage standardize surgical technique 's laparoscopic colectomy discuss multicenter trial well outline one previous study . This study retrospectively review consecutive series patient undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy 1999 2001 single institution . The potential benefit standardize technique include 1 ) standardization surgical instrument set , 2 ) definition benchmark decision convert inappropriate investment time equipment , 3 ) provision easily transfer skill set resident train . Despite obvious value standardize approach , variety technique laparoscopic instrument tissue dissection coagulation currently utilize . These option include laparoscopic stapler , lap clip applier , suture ligature , electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer , electric cautery , ultrasonic shear . Dissection , coagulation , division mesocolon mesorectum laparoscopy , continue represent technical hemostatic challenge . When deal inflame tissue , diverticulitis inflammatory bowel disease , mesocolon mesorectum fatty , reliable hemostasis always easy obtain . Concerning tissue dissection coagulation , electrosurgery , widely implement open surgery , display complication limit relate minimally invasive technique . The search safer multidimensional instrument lead development ultrasonic dissector ( UCS ) , ( Harmonic Scalpel , Ultracision , Ethicon Endosurgery Inc. , Cincinnati , OH ) endoscopic Ligasure ( LIG EBVS ) , ( Valleylab , Boulder , CO ) . Use ultrasonic dissection colorectal laparoscopic surgery recently review retrospectively two study . Both study conclude ultrasonic dissection safe effective . A prospective randomize clinical trial also demonstrate use UCS provide advantage decrease blood loss compare ES without increase morbidity . Recently electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer , ( EBVS ) ( Ligasure , Valleylab , Boulder , CO , USA ) develop laparoscopic open procedure alternative suture ligature , hemoclips , stapler ultrasonic coagulator 's ligating vessel , tissue bundle . The EBVS approve Food Drug Administration seal vessel 7mm diameter . It apply high current low voltage , differs energy use standard monopolar bipolar cautery . This unique form energy denatures collagen elastin within vessel wall surround connective tissue . The addition extreme pressure apply instrument , also differ energy source , cause denature protein reform , vessel wall apposition . Clinically , result nearly translucent `` seal '' may transect . The Ligasure device use type gastrointestinal surgery include small large bowel resection , gastrectomy , pancreatectomy , splenectomy , esophagogastric devascularization portal hypertension , transplantation . To date , device appear cost effective teaching institution use difficult open laparoscopic surgery . The initial result EBVS colorectal surgery prospective review 98 case single surgeon 1998 2000 . These include laparoscopic open case involve 53 colon resection . No postoperative hemorrhagic complication occur estimate mean reduction operative time 39 minute . Additionally , author ' apply ligasure technology pig animal model consistently report evidence postoperative bleeding . They conclude EBVS safe effective may potentially reduce operative time . A second study , also retrospective analysis , compare Ligasure ultrasonic coagulator total abdominal colectomy 15 patient ulcerative colitis . The procedure use Ligasure reduce operating time , intraoperative bleeding operator 's stress comparison ultrasonic coagulation . A third study , another retrospective comparative model , conduct address difference EBVS ultrasonic shear laparoscopic transverse sigmoid colectomy . The study include 30 patient find incidence rebleeding significantly low EBVS group UCS group surgical procedure . In addition require time mesocolon dissection also significantly short EBVS use . The prospective randomized study Ligasure laparoscopic colorectal surgery address speed , reliability cost guide surgeon choice intracorporeal pedicle ligation . This study involve straight laparoscopy hand-assisted laparoscopy compare laparoscopic vascular stapler disposable clip applier Ligasure Atlas elective right , leave , total colectomy . Cases stratify procedure failure define bleed pedicle ligation . 100 patient include study Ligasure atlas find cost effective associate low failure rate . Significance Purpose The utilization safety surgical stapler disposable clip laparoscopic colectomy establish adopt majority surgeon 's performing procedure . Although grow evidence support application Ligasure laparoscopic colorectal surgery demonstrate safety efficiency , study limit sample size retrospective nature . There also several question leave unanswered . A standardized approach laparoscopic right , total , leave colectomy never substantiate prospective study . Furthermore , difficult somewhat dangerous step involve division mesorectum laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy low anterior resection appropriately evaluate . The objective study determine best technical approach laparoscopic right , total , leave colectomy compare utilization Ligasure device electrocautery application surgical clip and/or surgical stapler 's . To answer question investigator compare approach regard tissue dissection , colonic mobilization pedicle ligation . Safety , cost , operative time , time pedicle ligation hemostasis objectively measure treatment group .</detailed_description>
