	<brief_summary>Background Study Aims : Biliary stricture major cause morbidity follow liver transplantation overall incidence 10 30 % . Up biliary stricture dilate subsequently one three plastic stent diameter eight ten F insert . In general , stent exchange two three month interval one year . In present prospective control study , efficacy complication rate balloon dilation compare dilation plus stenting . Patients Methods : XY patient high-grade biliary stricture ( anastomotic non-anastomotic ) enrol prospective study random order . X patient treat endoscopic balloon dilatation Y balloon dilatation plus plastic stent placement six eight week interval . The primary end point permanent opening biliary obstruction 12 month . Number endoscopic intervention complication procedure monitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Treatment Biliary Strictures After LTX : Balloon Dilatation Versus Stent Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic treatment perform experienced endoscopists perform 1000 ERCP procedure . The procedure perform patient general anesthesia propofol . A stenosis consider present cholangiogram show stricture narrow anastomosis proximal donor duct site anastomosis incomplete distal runoff contrast agent . The patient divide two group : 1 ) balloon dilatation stricture , 2 ) balloon dilatation plus plastic stent placement . In group , endoscopic treatment patient comprise sphincterotomy , consecutive dilation stenosis 10 F , removement occlude material choledochus duct use balloon catheter necessary , repetitive balloon dilatation anastomosis stricture non-anastomotic proximal donor duct stricture 18 F first intervention 24 F follow intervention . The second group patient additionally treat large-diameter ( 10 F ) plastic stent placement balloon dilatation . This procedure repeat 6 - 8 week interval group .</detailed_description>
