	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common invasive malignancy second leading cause cancer death American male . In 2005 , estimate 230,000 men diagnose 30,000 die prostate cancer . The current estimate risk develop prostate cancer 1 6 men . Carcinogenesis neoplastic progression prostate cancer depend genetic epigenetic factor ; multi-step process lead progression androgen-dependent , non-metastatic phenotype malignant , metastatic , androgen-independent phenotype . Treatment option localize prostate cancer include watchful waiting , surgical prostatectomy , target irradiation . The latter two treatment cure cancer confine prostate gland , yet many patient occult metastasis time presentation , particularly bone regional lymph node . Advanced prostate cancer metastases present difficult therapeutic problem . Those disease progression hormonal therapy limit option . Patients initially treat combination Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone ( LHRH ) analog synthetic antiandrogen occasionally respond withdrawal anti-androgen . Chemotherapy also option setting , docetaxel-based therapy small survival advantage patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . There clearly need effective regimen patient prostate cancer . With current limitation treatment option , renew public scientific interest use less toxic herbal preparation treatment cancer . Herbal supplement may play especially important role prostate cancer , consider high incidence oftentimes slow progression . However , physician confidently recommend dietary supplementation , scientific investigation require .</detailed_description>
