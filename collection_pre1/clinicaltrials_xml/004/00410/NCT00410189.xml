	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine 8 week progression-free survival rate ( i.e . disease control rate ) patient advance NSCLC fail least one prior chemotherapy regimen . Secondary Objectives : - Determine overall response rate - Determine overall survival - Determine time disease progression - Assess safety/toxicity study treatment - Assess biomarker modulation tumor tissue serum sample treatment - Assess plasma intra-tumor concentration study treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BATTLE Program : ZD6474 Previously Treated Subjects With NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZD6474 design block formation new blood vessel . The growth new blood vessel call angiogenesis . Angiogenesis think important growth tumor beyond small size . Researchers want find ZD6474 limit new blood vessel growth tumor `` starve '' tumor limit blood flow . In order enroll study , must also enrol Protocol 2005-0823 : A Biomarker-integrated study Chemorefractory Patients Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer . Protocol 2005-0823 screening study group study call BATTLE program . Participants Protocol 2005-0823 assigned one research study . The result tumor analysis help study doctor determine assign particular treatment study . While study , take ZD6474 mouth morning . ZD6474 swallow whole tablet . The tablet chew , crush , divide take 8 ounce water small amount food lessen stomach discomfort . You take ZD6474 time every day . Four ( 4 ) week consider 1 treatment cycle . If miss dose unable take miss dose day , take next schedule dose miss dose make . The dose study medication may repeat vomit occurs within 30 minute take study medication . You routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , every 4 week . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , every 3 month . Every 4 week , complete medical history record physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , performance status evaluation , weight . You also routine urine test study doctor ask medication take smoke history . Every 2 cycle , tumor evaluate chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate status disease . If take coumadin , blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clotting function every week . You ask bring unused medication clinic visit . You may continue receive ZD6474 long cancer respond study treatment . Your doctor may decide take study experience intolerable side effect , medical condition get bad , and/or unable comply study requirement . If stop study treatment , may able enroll 1 remain 3 protocols BATTLE program . After stop take study treatment , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You also blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clotting function . You performance status evaluation , chest x-ray , ECG , CT MRI scan . Following evaluation , contact telephone every 3 month 3 year see . You right leave study time . If choose stop participating study , contact study chair and/or research nurse . This investigational study . ZD6474 investigational drug approve FDA research use . Up 72 patient take part multicenter study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
