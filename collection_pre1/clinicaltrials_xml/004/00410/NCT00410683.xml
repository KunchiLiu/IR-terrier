	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether give radiation therapy surgery effective radiation therapy treat patient non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy see well work compare radiation therapy treat patient non-small cell lung cancer completely remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival patient completely resect non-small cell lung cancer treat conformal thoracic radiotherapy v radiotherapy . Secondary - Determine toxicity , particular cardiac pulmonary toxicity , regimens patient . - Compare local control patient treat regimen . - Determine pattern recurrence patient treat regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Assess second cancer patient treat regimen . - Assess prognostic factor predictive factor treatment effect disease-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine cost per recurrence-free year life . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord participate center , prior chemotherapy ( neoadjuvant alone vs adjuvant v none ) , number lymph station involve ( 0 vs 1 v ≥ 2 ) , histology ( squamous cell v ) , use pretreatment positron emission tomography scan ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Beginning within 4-8 week surgery 2-6 week chemotherapy , patient undergo adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy daily , 5 day per week , 6 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo adjuvant thoracic radiotherapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically to10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 700 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
