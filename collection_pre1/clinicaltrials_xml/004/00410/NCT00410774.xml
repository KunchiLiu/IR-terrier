	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth pancreatic cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving gemcitabine bevacizumab surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect gemcitabine bevacizumab see well work treat patient pancreatic cancer completely remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety adjuvant , fixed-dose rate gemcitabine hydrochloride bevacizumab patient completely resect pancreatic cancer . - Determine 1-year disease-free survival rate patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine 1- 2-year overall survival rate patient . - Determine median disease-free survival rate patient . - Determine median overall survival rate patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute follow bevacizumab* IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *The first dose bevacizumab administer 6 week pass since surgery . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 18 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
