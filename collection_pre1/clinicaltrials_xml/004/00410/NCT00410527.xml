	<brief_summary>This study compare two treatment strategy ( standard versus short-course antibiotic therapy ) prevent resistant bacterial infection patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) . ICUs frequently identify source hospital-acquired infection . This study examine effectiveness 3 day antibiotic treatment reduce risk develop antimicrobial-resistant bacteria compare standard antibiotic therapy least 8 day . It also determine whether short-course therapy reduce duration cost ICU hospital stay , antibiotic treatment , cost involve treatment infection-related problem . Patients participate institution ICU may eligible study . Candidates must 18 year age old . They must hospital least 3 day , develop new pulmonary infiltrates ( fluid cell airspace lung ) ICU stay must low risk pneumonia . Participants short-course therapy take antibiotic 3 day ; receive standard therapy take antibiotic least 8 day . Both group receive treatment intravenously ( vein ) . Sputum specimens collect baseline ( start therapy ) day 3 , 10 , 28 . Throat culture specimen obtain baseline day 3 , 10 , 28 . Nasal anal stool sample collect baseline day 10 28 . Cultures respiratory specimen obtain throughout study period examine evidence antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolation potential pathogen . All patient follow 28 day enrollment discharge hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study enroll subject hospitalize least three day ( fourth day hospital stay ) , new pulmonary infiltrates ICU stay low risk pneumonia , determine use Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score ( CPIS ) . The study design determine whether 3 day antibiotic treatment meropenem ( without coverage MRSA ) reduce risk colonization antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolation potential pathogen compare standard antibiotic therapy ( minimum 8 day therapy antibiotic primary care team 's choosing ) . The study also examine whether short-course therapy reduces length ICU hospital LOS cost base ICU hospital LOS , antibiotic treatment , standardize cost related treatment infection-related adverse experience , without negative effect subject mortality incidence clinically significant infection .</detailed_description>
