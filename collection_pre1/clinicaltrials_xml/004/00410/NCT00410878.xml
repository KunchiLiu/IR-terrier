	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize steady-state pharmacokinetic ( metabolism action ) profile OROS hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) patient require opioid therapy daily basis chronic pain condition . Patients stabilize prior opioids convert OROS hydromorphone slow release titrate ( slowly increase decrease ) adequate analgesia ( pain relief ) . They maintain dose 4-10 day blood sample draw 24 hour last day study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Repeated Dose Study Metabolism Action Evaluation OROS Hydromorphone HCI ( Slow Release ) Tablets Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , repeated-dose study involve patient require opioid therapy daily basis chronic pain condition . In study , baseline evaluation perform Visit 1 . Patients give diary record daily opioid medication use daily pain-relief rating throughout study . During time Visit 1 Visit 2 patient continue take prior oral transdermal opioid medication pain . Patients consider stabilized usual activity , total daily dose baseline medication remain unchanged , three opioid breakthrough pain medication doses/day administer , two consecutive day . Patients return within 1 week Visit 1 Visit 2 . During visit , patient 's 24-hour baseline oral opioid dose convert hydromorphone conversion ratio approximately 5:1 ( oral morphine sulfate oral hydromorphone HCI mg equivalent ) . Patients dispense OROS hydromorphone HCI slow release tablet increase acceptable analgesia ( pain relief ) . Eligible stabilized patient require total daily dose least 8 mg 64 mg OROS hydromorphone HCI slow release ( exclusive breakthrough medication ) begin 5-10 day maintenance therapy phase Visit 3 . Morphine sulfate ( immediate-release tablet ) provide breakthrough pain medication . Patients return clinic morning follow minimum 4 day continuous OROS hydromorphone HCI slow release therapy constant daily dose Visit 4 . Upon arrival clinic , initial ( trough ) blood sample take prior witnessed administration usual dosage OROS hydromorphone HCI slow release . The exact time drug administration document . Patients instructed return follow morning consume food beverage within 3 hour schedule visit . Patients instruct self administer OROS hydromorphone HCI slow release follow morning ; dose clinic . Patients could take immediate release morphine sulfate need . Patients return clinic next morning ( visit 5 ) remain 24-hour period witness dose plasma ( blood ) sample pharmacokinetic ( metabolism/action ) analysis . Dosing plasma ( blood ) sample begin 24 hour follow time dose clinic previous day . Water ( 240 mL ) take medication . Immediately prior blood draw , patient rat pain intensity use 11-point scale rat pain intensity 0 ( pain ) 10 ( pain bad imagine ) . Blood sample analysis drawn : 0 ( prior dosing ) , 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,15,18,21 24 hour dose . Urine output collect 24-hour period select patient . Vital sign take . At conclusion Visit 5 event early study termination , Global Evaluation physical examination perform . The patient 's diary review patient unused study medication collect . Safety assessment include vital sign physical examination start end study . OROS Hydromorphone HCL ( slow release ) 8,16,32 , 64 mg tablet orally . Patients stabilize prior opioids convert OROS Hydromorphone HCL ( slow release ) slowly increase decreased adequate analgesia . Then patient maintain dose 4 - 10 day . Duration treatment 31 day .</detailed_description>
