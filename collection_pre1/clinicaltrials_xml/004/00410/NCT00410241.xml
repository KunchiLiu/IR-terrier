	<brief_summary>This study examine genome sequence clinical research . Genome sequence process researcher analyze ( sequence ) part genome single person . The human genome material cell include thousand gene . Gene change cause contribute disease pass one generation next . This study first focus heart disease . Later , researcher hope study condition gene , eventual goal sequence participant gene . Participants age 45 65 year age smoke , may eligible study . Patients come NIH Clinical Research Center initial study last half day . They donate blood sample complete short survey . Then meet genetic counselor learn genome sequencing . Those join study undergo follow procedure evaluation : - Family history medical history . - Measurement height blood pressure . - Noninvasive heart test , include electrocardiogram echocardiogram . - Drawing 3 ounce blood ( 5 6 tablespoon ) ; part blood sample use research another part clinical testing . - Multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) , test measure coronary artery calcification , , condition inflexibility . Each patient receive letter result clinical laboratory value evaluation . There recommendation follow-up patient doctor . Risks study include exposure radiation CT test . The radiation amount use person normally receive natural source , sun , outer space , radioactive material find naturally earth air soil . Another slight risk involve reaction contrast agent may use echocardiogram . Side effect headache , nausea vomiting , warm sensation , dizziness . With sample patient provide , researcher start sequence 400 gene related heart disease . Analysis take month complete . Genome sequence difficult , researcher much learn gene sequence gene change find . If researcher find gene change important health participant , contact participant give him/her choice learn result . This study may may direct benefit participant . Patients would get free clinical test cholesterol , diabetes , condition , well information gene change . Knowledge gain benefit people future researcher learn relationship gene change health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ClinSeq : A Large-Scale Medical Sequencing Clinical Research Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose ClinSeq pilot large-scale medical sequencing ( LSMS ) clinical research set . By sequence person exome genome return relevant individual result person , begin investigate technical , medical , genetic counseling issue accompany implementation LSMS clinical setting . Specifically , seek develop technologic procedural infrastructure facilitate type research demonstrate feasible sequence interpret large amount genomic sequence data return individual result subject . A cohort ~1,500 individual select surround general population evaluate NIH Clinical Center common set cardiovascular phenotypic feature , include , limited , coronary artery calcification , lipid profile , blood pressure . Participants select fall within spectrum coronary artery calcification normal disease phenotype base Framingham score . During initial visit , participant undergo clinical evaluation , target clinical test , blood sample collection genomic analysis . Additionally , ask provide baseline information pertinent health behavior family history . During initial visit study progress , participant may ask complete survey relate various socio-behavioral aspect participation , attitudes toward learn individual result health behavior relate receipt result . Most participant exome sequencing ( ES ) , select participant genome sequencing ( GS ) . ClinSeq understand relative contribution rare versus common variant architecture common disease . Currently , direct sequence address question frequency rare variant , particular interest u . We test association genomic variant , rare , cardiovascular phenotype question , well phenotype . We develop analytic algorithm distinguish potentially pathogenic genetic alteration normal variation ( Johnston et al. , 2012 ; Ng et al. , 2013 ; Gonsalves et al. , 2013 ) . Sequence variant deem clinically relevant validate CLIAcertified laboratory result offer subject . ClinSeq design provide long-term potential pursue many different clinical project . Relatives ClinSeq participant may invite enroll project limited study participation aid understand gene variant detect probands . For example , relatives may undergo genetic test co-segregation know suspected disease-causing variant , and/or phenotyping relevant disease question . We aim pilot procedure generate data , address analytical hurdle interpret data , develop approach medical counseling challenge utilize relevant data clinical research .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Group A We plan recruit cohort whose risk develop coronary artery disease range le 5 percent , base 10yearrisk provided Framingham risk score , great 10 percent , include know coronary artery disease . The 10yearrisk measure Framingham risk score base LDL cholesterol level . Individuals eligible Bins 13 study 45 65 year age , individual eligible Bin 4 must 3565 year age . We select cutoff interested recruiting cohort whose coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) measurement range normal diseased , show abnormal CAC infrequent age . Also , individual eligible study require primary care physician equivalent communicate event uncover condition merit followup . The exception include individual Group A2 recruit community outreach do Ms. Sandra Epps . These individual require primary care physician , although strongly recommend attend community health clinic followup clinical recommendation study . Additionally , individual eligible study require nonsmoker time enrollment , purpose define someone smoke regularly previous 12 month . Due large number individual recruit intention follow cohort longitudinally , focus effort metropolitan DC Baltimore area ( order minimize reluctance participate travel limitation ) . If recruitment anticipated level , may seek additional subject Richmond , VA metropolitan area . Individuals local area may consider participation part protocol within NHLBI , travel NIH Clinical Research Center regular basis followup , willing travel NIH need protocol participation ( expense ) . Bin 4 participant eligible cost transportation , meal lodge cover must travel &gt; 500 mile clinical visit . An eligibility screen perform telephone ascertain age , basic demographic , smoke history , presence absence know cardiovascular disease . We intend recruit person sex , diverse ethnic racial category , various socioeconomic background . Group B The eligibility Group B distinct Group A . Group B eligibility require : 1. relative enrol Group A 2. age 18 year , unless phenotype study affect child EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individual exclude participate study include : ( 1 ) firstdegree relative enrol ClinSeq participant ( unless fall Group B ) ; ( 2 ) individual directly involve gathering data analyze clinical genotyping data , include Principal Investigator , Associate Investigators , ClinSeq staff involve subject clinical level ( Nurse Practitioner , Genetic counselor , etc . ) , staff NISC involve generate analyze sequence data ; ( 3 ) individual request access raw sequence data analysis outside ClinSeq ; ( 4 ) individual already enrol another study provide genome exome sequencing , GENEFORECAST Study ( 14HG0048 ) .</criteria>
