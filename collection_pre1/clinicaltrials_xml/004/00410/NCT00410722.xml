	<brief_summary>To determine tree nut ( Almonds , Hazelnuts , Pistachios , Peanuts , Macadamia nut , Pecans , Walnuts Cashews ) improve glycemic control type 2 diabetes , assess HbA1c serum fructosamine , ass whether outcome relate improvement cardiovascular health ( i.e . plasma lipids measure oxidative stress , inflammatory biomarkers nitric oxide generation ) . The investigator find nut tend reduce glycemic index bread little effect raise blood glucose . Therefore investigator believe would ideal food displace high glycemic food diet low dietary glycemic load . This result improve blood glucose control type 2 diabetes , additional benefit coronary heart disease risk factor due effect nut .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator wish study effect nut glycemic control confirm lipid lower effect type 2 diabetes . The consumption nuts high unsaturated fat , vegetable protein ( arginine ) fiber content decrease glycemic load diet improve glycemic control . The investigator anticipate favorable fatty acid profile nut along vegetable protein improve blood lipid profile type 2 diabetes thereby establish cardiovascular risk reduction associate nuts population . Furthermore , flavonoid vitamin E present high concentration nut , know antioxidant activity may help counter elevate oxidative stress inflammation experience diabetic . The investigator therefore determine effect nut feed measure oxidative stress ( include oxidize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , consider direct relevance coronary heart disease ) , inflammation ( C-reactive protein , serum amyloid A interleukin-6 ) nitric oxide metabolism ( blood nitric oxide nitrotyrosine level ) . These data would add interest nut relation cardiovascular disease risk reduction diabetic complication . Background Diet : A diet conforming American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) Adult Treatment Panel III guideline . Nuts , soy dietary supplement ( vitamin , mineral , herbal remedy ) exclude background diet phase study . Treatment diet : ( 1 ) Full-Dose Nut Diet : Raw nut added supplement subject 's usual diet . Subjects calorie need 2,400 kcal great , assess Lipid Research Clinic ( LRC ) table , receive full-dose supplement ( 100 g/d nut , approximately 600 kcal ) . Subjects require 1,600-2,400 kcal daily receive 75 % full-dose supplement ( 75 g/d nut , approximately 450 kcal ) . Subjects require less 1,600 kcal daily receive 50 % full-dose supplement ( 50 g/d nut , approximately 300 kcal ) . ( 2 ) Half-Dose Nut Diet : Raw nut added supplement subject 's usual diet . Subjects calorie need 2,400 kcal great , assess LRC table , receive half full dose nut supplement ( 50 g/d nut , approximately 300 kcal ) rest calorie provide muffin ( 2 muffin 300 kcal ) total 600 kcal . Subjects require 1,600-2,400 kcal daily receive 75 % half-dose supplement ( 37.5 g/d nut 1.5 muffin , approximately 450 kcal ) . Subjects require less 1,600 kcal daily receive 50 % half-dose supplement ( 25 g/d nut 1 muffin , approximately 300 kcal ) . ( 3 ) : The full-dose control supplement four 150 kcal muffin . Control supplement match energy content nut supplement , i.e . either 600 kcal/d ( 4 muffin ) ; 450 kcal/d ( 3 muffin ) ; 300 kcal/d ( 2 muffin ) . The macronutrient composition muffin conform NCEP Step 2 diet 25 % total fat , &lt; 7 % saturate fat use corn oil oil commonly use healthy baked good , 18 % protein ( average subject population ) use add skim milk powder , zero cholesterol . Muffins make whole wheat flour . Diet History : one-week weigh diet history obtain prior start week 4 , 8 12 study assessment macronutrients , dietary fiber fatty acid . Palatability/Satiety : palatability satiety , subject record rating use 7-point bipolar semantic scale monthly interval study phase . Anthropometry Blood Pressure : height recruitment body weight , blood pressure , waist hip circumference , body composition take immediately prior clinic visit ( wk 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 , 12 ) study .</detailed_description>
