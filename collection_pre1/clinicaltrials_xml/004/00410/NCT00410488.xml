	<brief_title>Palonosetron Sarcoma Patients Receiving Chemotherapy With Adriamycin Ifosfamide ( AI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palonosetron drug design prevent treat nausea vomit cause chemotherapy . If find eligible take part study , several blood sample take ( 3 teaspoon ) . Researchers use sample monitor blood count chemotherapy period myelosuppression ( condition bone marrow activity decrease ) . These blood sample take least 2 time week , certain time , take day . You ask fill QOL questionnaire nausea vomiting , least 2 time Cycle 1 ( one cycle last 21 day ) . It take 10 minute complete questionnaire . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . Participants one group receive one dose palonosetron Day 0 . Participants group receive 3 dos palonosetron Days 0 , 2 , 4 . Palonosetron give participant group , intravenous ( IV -- needle vein ) infusion 30 minute . You ask keep study diary treatment period . Study personnel give diary tell complete . Your side effect ( include severe ) medication dos need record diary every day . You ask return diary post-treatment return visit ( every 3 week ) . While study , receive chemotherapy part standard treatment . All participant receive least 2 cycle adriamycin ifosfamide chemotherapy ( AI ) . A cycle 3 week long . You may receive 6 cycle adriamycin ifosfamide . Adriamycin give one large injection central venous catheter ( plastic tube needle place collarbone ) Day 0 . Ifosfamide give 3 hour every day 4 day ( Days 0-3 ) . Zinecard give one large injection catheter Day 0 . Mesna give 24-hour infusion every day 4 day catheter ( Days 0-3 ) . Zinecard mesna give standard care . Zinecard use protect heart-related side effect . Mesna use protect bladder-related side effect . For patient certain type sarcoma , vincristine give catheter rapid infusion Day 0 . You may treat outpatient inpatient . You ask return M. D.Anderson every 3 week evaluation disease , chest x-ray , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , physical exam perform . Additional blood sample ( 3 teaspoon ) take cycle often need measure blood count electrolytes ( mineral body ) monitor imbalance . You ask contact study doctor nurse bad side effect experience medication ( over-the-counter prescription ) take treatment period . You also ask notify doctor ( separate study doctor ) participate research study . Your treatment continue least 6 cycle , unless disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If experience intolerable side effect disease get bad study , may take study . Once stop treatment , call end-of-study visit . During visit , evaluate disease status CT MRI scan . You vital sign weight measure . You ask medication take since last visit bad side effect experience . You also final blood draw ( 3 teaspoon ) routine test . Your participation study end 18 week ( 4 5 month ) . Once go study , standard follow-up require doctor . This investigational study . Palonosetron FDA approve commercially available . Up 50 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
