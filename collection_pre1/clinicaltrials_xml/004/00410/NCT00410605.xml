	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together lenalidomide dexamethasone work treat patient relapsed refractory stage II stage III multiple myeloma . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bevacizumab lenalidomide may stop growth multiple myeloma block blood flow cancer . Dexamethasone may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Giving bevacizumab together lenalidomide dexamethasone may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient relapse refractory stage II III multiple myeloma treat bevacizumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine time progression patient . II . Determine toxicity tolerability regimen . III . Determine effect bevacizumab lenalidomide marker myeloma activity myeloma cell stromal cell , include interleukin-6 , macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î± , vascular endothelial growth factor , STAT3 . IV . Assess local cytokine milieu use tissue microarrays bone marrow biopsy specimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 , oral lenalidomide day 1-21 , oral dexamethasone day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline course 2 4 . Blood sample examine vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) polymorphisms pyrosequencing VEGF , VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 , interleukin-6 , macrophage inflammatory protein 1 immunoenzyme technique . Relationships plasma cell myeloma stroma effect study treatment relationship examine tissue section bone marrow treatment utilize microvessel density measurement , VEGF staining , STAT3 staining ( immunohistochemistry fluorescent situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 5 year .</detailed_description>
