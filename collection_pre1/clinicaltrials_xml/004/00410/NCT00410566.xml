	<brief_title>Safety Study rhASM Enzyme Replacement Therapy Adults With Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency ( Niemann-Pick Disease )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ASM deficiency ( ASMD ) , also know Niemann-Pick A B disease , rare genetic disorder reduce activity lysosomal enzyme , ASM , lead accumulation sphingomyelin primarily macrophages throughout body . This deficiency result characteristic feature hepatosplenomegaly , thrombocytopenia , interstitial lung disease , growth retardation , coronary artery disease , fatigue , severe case , neurodegeneration death early childhood . There specific treatment disease . This Phase 1 safety study seek enroll minimum 12 maximum 30 eligible adult patient ASMD patient participate approximately 7 week .</detailed_description>
