	<brief_summary>An alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) rich diet Lyon Heart Study reduce sudden cardiac death possibly reduce cardiac arrhythmia ventricular fibrillation ( Lancet 1994 ) . Since , grow interest ALA cardioprotective nutrient . Much interest focus potential antiarrhythmic effect ω-3 fatty acid , especially long chain ω-3 fatty acid , DHA EPA , derive fish . We therefore conclude important test whether short chain ω-3 vegetable oil ALA also antiarrhythmic effect , since might also explain beneficial effect see cardiovascular mortality Lyon Heart Study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : We determine effect ALA rich diet reduce recurrence atrial fibrillation example cardiac arrhythmia . Design : Randomized parallel design efficacy study . Setting : Three university hospital center Bordeaux region , France . Patients : 98 successive patient successfully underwent electro cardioversion 75 complete study without major deviation accord protocol . Intervention : A canola margarine oil together Mediterranean diet ( ALA ω-3 , 1.4 g/d ) versus conventional diet ( control ) , one year follow-up . Main outcome measure : Length time first recurrence atrial fibrillation . Significance : If ALA antiarrhythmic action may explain cardioprotective effect clinical trial cohort study .</detailed_description>
