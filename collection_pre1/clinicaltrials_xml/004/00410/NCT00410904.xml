	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give AZD2171 together pemetrexed disodium work treat patient relapse non-small cell lung cancer . AZD2171 pemetrexed disodium may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . AZD2171 may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving AZD2171 together pemetrexed disodium may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response rate patient relapse non-small cell lung cancer treat AZD2171 pemetrexed disodium . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior bevacizumab treatment ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 course 1 day 1-21 course 2 subsequent course . Patients also receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 8 course 1 day 1 course 2 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 3 weeks* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . [ Note : * The first course 4 week duration ; subsequent course 3 week duration . ] After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
