	<brief_summary>The purpose repeat dose study develop recommend dose information initiation therapy OROS Hydromorphone patient chronic non-malignant pain convert strong oral transdermal opioids . It also assist development recommend start dose patient titrated appropriate maintenance dose OROS Hydromorphone HCI . The safety profile OROS Hydromorphone HCI also evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Repeated-Dose Evaluation Pain Relieving Drug Use Safety OROS Hydromorphone HCI Patients With Chronic Non-Malignant Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-blind ( respect dose ) , repeat dose study evaluate patient chronic non-malignant pain conduct tandem similar protocol patient chronic cancer pain . A total 463 patient enrol evaluated study . Patients receive chronic opioid therapy convert daily OROS hydromorphone use oral morphine equivalent . Supplementary immediate-release ( IR ) hydromorphone provide breakthrough pain . The dose OROS hydromorphone escalate every 2 day therapy 3 dos immediate-release ( IR ) hydromorphone require 24-hour period . Once patient could maintain stable dose OROS hydromorphone 3 consecutive day , patient enter 2-week maintenance phase . Patients complete study eligible participation OROS hydromorphone long-term extension study , Study DO-109 . The hypothesis 24-hour controlled-release form oral hydromorphone may provide consistent pain relief , convenient dosing , enhance compliance possibly decrease incidence side effect associate peak ( high ) trough ( low ) fluctuation plasma drug concentration typically see immediate-release dosage formulation . Patients receive OROS Hydromorphone HCI Visit 2,3 , 4 ( either 8,16,32 , and/or 64mg tablet ) take orally . OROS Hydromorphone HCI dos titrate every two day therapy necessary dose stabilization occur , follow two week Maintenance Therapy Phase .</detailed_description>
