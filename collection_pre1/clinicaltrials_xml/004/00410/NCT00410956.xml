	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , floxuridine dexamethasone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving chemotherapy directly arteries around tumor together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give floxuridine dexamethasone hepatic arterial infusion together bevacizumab work treat patient unresectable primary liver cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine median time progression patient unresectable primary hepatic malignancy treat hepatic arterial infusion comprise floxuridine dexamethasone combination systemic bevacizumab . Secondary - Determine utility dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) assess change tumor perfusion treatment . - Correlate DCE-MRI finding radiographic tumor response . Tertiary - Correlate expression pattern vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 cognate ligand ( include VEGF-A , VEGF-B , VEGF-C , VEGF-D , placenta growth factor [ PlGF ] ) disease progression survival therapy . - Assess pro-angiogenic activity peripheral blood treatment . - Assess tumor immunohistochemical marker hypoxia ( e.g. , hypoxia-inducible factor [ HIF-1α ] , carbonic anhydrase IX [ CA IX ] , glucose transporter [ Glut-1 Glut-3 ] ) correlation initial treatment-related change perfusion permeability , determine DCE-MRI . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients undergo placement hepatic arterial infusion ( HAI ) pump cholecystectomy . Approximately 2 week later , patient receive floxuridine dexamethasone HAI continuously day 1-14 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 15 course 1 day 1 15 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) day 1 15 course 1 every 8 week thereafter . Tumor nontumor tissue collect time HAI pump placement . Tissue examine expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -A , -B , -C , -D , placenta growth factor ( PlGF ) , VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , -2 , -3 immunohistochemistry . Peripheral blood collect baseline day 1 course . Plasma level VEGF-A , -B , -C , -D measure immunoenzyme technique . Blood also examine flow cytometry immunological method protein extraction analysis VEGF VEGFR expression ( western blot ) . Immunohistochemical marker hypoxia tissue , include hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1α ) , carbonic anhydrase IX ( CA IX ) , glucose transporter ( Glut-1 Glut-3 ) , Ki-67 assess . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 55 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
