	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize safe effective mean conversion titration appropriate dose hydromorphone HCI , demonstrate comparable efficacy OROS hydromorphone HCI SR ( slow release ) hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) follow administration approximately equivalent total daily dos demonstrate significant dose-response relationship OROS hydromorphone HCI SR ( slow release ) breakthrough pain medication use alternatively , diary-based analgesic score</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effectiveness Tolerability OROS Hydromorphone HCI SR ( Slow-release ) Tablets Immediate-Release Hydromorphone Tablets Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take , dosage ) , repeated-dose , three-arm parallel group study conduct three phase . Following Prior Opioid Stabilization Phase , wherein patient require stable dose chronic opioid therapy , patient convert , titrate stabilized hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) achieve acceptable level analgesia Open-Label Hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) Conversion , Titration , Stabilization Phase . Supplementary hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) provide breakthrough pain , patient consider stabilized hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) total daily dose hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) remain unchanged three hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) breakthrough pain medication dos per day 2 consecutive day . Patients able achieve stable total daily dose least 20 mg 60 mg hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) ( exclusive breakthrough pain medication ) within 14 day Open-Label hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) Conversion , Titration , Stabilization Phase study enter Double-Blind , Randomized , Repeat Dosing Phase study . Patients randomize receive 7 day either OROS hydromorphone HCI SR ( slow release ) daily dose approximately equal stabilized total daily dose hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) , OROS hydromorphone HCI SR ( slow release ) daily dose approximately equal one-half stabilize total daily dose hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) ( 1/2 OROS hydromorphone slow release ) , hydromorphone HCI IR ( immediate release ) daily dose stabilize ( hydromorphone immediate release ) . Patients complete study eligible participation open-label OROS hydromorphone SR ( slow release ) long-term extension study ( Protocol DO-109 ) . OROS hydromorphone slow release 8 , 16 32 mg tablet , hydromorphone immediate release 2 4 mg tablet , placebo immediate release 2 4 mg tablet placebo slow release 8 , 16 , 32 mg tablet take orally 7 day</detailed_description>
