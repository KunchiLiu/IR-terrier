	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter , open-label , extension study characterize safety tolerability long-term , repeat dose OROS hydromorphone patient chronic cancer chronic non-malignant pain . Patients chronic cancer chronic non-malignant pain complete OROS hydromorphone short-term study ( DO-104 , DO-105 , DO-119 ) approximately 4 week duration . During study , patient continue receive dose OROS hydromorphone receive short-term study , dose adjustment need control pain adverse event . Patients treat outpatient basis . The study extend 1 year 2 year duration . Monthly evaluation patient treat OROS hydromorphone chronic pain perform identify adverse event , construct safety tolerability profile , assess efficacy . Dose adjustment permit provide disease progression , pain control , adverse event . Quarterly physical examination perform detect significant change underlie condition patient change may associate long-term opioid therapy . OROS hydromorphone 24 hour control release tablet 8 , 16 , 32 64 mg ingest orally daily 1 year dose adjustment need control pain adverse event .</detailed_description>
