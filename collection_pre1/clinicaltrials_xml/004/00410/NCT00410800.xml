	<detailed_description>The Pima Indians high report prevalence NIDDM population world . Within population , possible identify subgroup individual particularly high risk NIDDM . This project examine whether defect insulin secretion contribute high risk NIDDM subgroups whether progress course disease . Healthy Pima men woman high risk NIDDM , include individual follow 4 group , recruit : 1 ) person whose mother and/or father develop diabetes early age ( le 35 ) ; 2 ) person whose mother diabetic pregnancy ; 3 ) person whose birth-weight le 2500 g ; 4 ) person enlarge abdominal fat cell ( great 1.08 microgram lipid/cell ) . These individual , well subject none risk factor group non-Pima control , admit NIH Clinical Research Unit Phoenix Indian Medical Center follow series study . Body composition determine DXA scan measure amount fat abdomen thigh use MRI . Fat cell size determine image scan randomly choose photograph isolate fat cell . Skeletal muscle tissue obtain percutaneous biopsy histochemical determination fat content muscle cell . A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test 25-g intravenous glucose tolerance test perform . Insulin action measure hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp ( insulin infusion : 40mU/m ( 2 ) min ) insulin secretory response glucose measure 5-step hyperglycemic glucose clamp immediately thereafter . Pima subject follow longitudinally discharge unit oral glucose tolerance test perform every three month .
