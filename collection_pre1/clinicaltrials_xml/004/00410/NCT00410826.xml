	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study cisplatin radiation therapy together without erlotinib hydrochloride compare well work treat patient stage III stage IV head neck cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving cisplatin radiation therapy together erlotinib hydrochloride may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether cisplatin radiation therapy effective without erlotinib hydrochloride treat head neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Radiation Therapy With Without Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare complete response rate patient locally advanced head neck cancer , treat cisplatin , radiotherapy erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) versus cisplatin radiotherapy alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate whether addition erlotinib increase acute long term toxicity cisplatin radiotherapy , patient locally advanced head neck cancer . II . Compare disease-free overall survival patient locally advanced head neck cancer treat cisplatin radiotherapy , without erlotinib . III . Evaluate whether symptomatic improvement observe first week erlotinib alone predict complete response long term disease control . IV . Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , p16 excision repair cross-complementing 1 ( ERCC-1 ) expression response outcome therapy cisplatin radiation without erlotinib . V. Identify molecular correlate may relevant pathogenesis squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) response therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 22 , 43 undergo 3-dimensional conformal intensity modulate radiotherapy daily , 5 day per week , day 1-47 . Patients also receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day -7 47 . ARM II : Patients receive cisplatin undergo radiotherapy Arm I . Within 10-14 week completion study treatment , patient N2 N3 disease time screen undergo neck dissection . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
