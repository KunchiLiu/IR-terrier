	<brief_summary>Based know 's mechanism action , bortezomib presume make chemotherapy drug work well . This study examine use bortezomib combination already effective chemotherapy regimen use treat leukemia relapse refractory treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study VELCADEÂ® With Mitoxantrone Etoposide Leukemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VELCADE drug block growth cancer cell help destroy . This research help u determine VELCADE combined chemotherapy useful treat leukemia diagnose . Your leukemia type respond chemotherapy come back successful therapy . VELCADE approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least one prior therapy . Multiple Myeloma type cancer develop blood cell . The dose drug use research study use treatment myeloma number injection less . VELCADE , however approve FDA use acute leukemia . Mitoxantrone etoposide , two chemotherapy drug also use treat leukemia . In first part study , go test safety VELCADE different dos give mitoxantrone etoposide . You may enrol one three dos . In second part , go assess response combination VELCADE chemotherapy drug . You receive VELCADE choose dose base safety assessment Phase I . It administer intravenous ( vein ) injection day-1 day-4 5-day schedule . In addition , also receive mitoxantrone 15 minute etoposide 45 minute day 1-5 . The first 28 day begin treatment call treatment cycle . On day-14 treatment cycle , bone marrow biopsy do see leukemia cell disappear . If evidence leukemia , may receive growth factor help marrow recover fast . If still presence leukemia , amount , treatment consider failure receive treatment . If partial improvement receive additional cycle VELCADE chemotherapy describe sign disease . This call complete remission . Therapy withhold time concern side-effects medically acceptable . Once side-effects resolve , VELCADE therapy may re-start low dose . It estimate may require two three cycle therapy .</detailed_description>
