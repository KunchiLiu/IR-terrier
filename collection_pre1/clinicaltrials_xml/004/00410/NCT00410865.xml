	<brief_title>Wild Type p53 Adenovirus Oral Premalignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some cancer occur mouth may way due defect gene call p53 gene . In study , adenovirus use tool ( `` vector '' ) deliver normal p53 gene cell . The part adenovirus allow reproduce promote infection remove , experimental gene ( p53 ) add . Prior begin study , participant complete medical history physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . Participants electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , urine test , blood test , include HIV test . At mid-cycle , another white blood cell count drawn . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Participants ask medication take past 30 day . Additionally , chest x-ray performed . All participant undergo complete head neck examination . This include visual [ direct well mirror ( fiberoptic require ) ] mucosal sit nasal lip area back throat . The physician manually examine area skin , salivary gland , neck , thyroid bed . Also , doctor make sure cranial nerve work properly . Location size lesion ( ) record measure two dimension . All lesion present photograph prior start intervention . Physical examination include fiberoptic exam , establish standard evaluate pre-cancerous lesion ( ) . Only concern cancer present , symptom beyond finding physical examination CT MRI prescribe . These test ( CT MRI ) do since establish role evaluation , management , follow-up lesion ( ) . If utilized , CT ( computerized tomography ) scan special test use x-ray along computer give detailed picture part body . An MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) special test use strong magnetic field radio frequency signal give detailed picture part body . An x-ray show 2-dimensional picture CT scan MRI show 3 dimension . Each study course include one week treatment follow three week observation . The length study 6 month ( 6 course ) participant . Participants return clinic twice day Days 2 - 5 month participation , expect spend total 6 hour day clinic . Participants study receive INGN 201 two way . The first way injection area lesion . The second way mouth rinse . Vital sign check time participant receive INGN 201 . The injection give first day week course , numb ( anesthetic ) medication apply prevent discomfort . The mouth rinse give one time first day two time Days 2 - 5 course INGN 201 . The injection rinse ( first day cycle ) , two rinse ( Days 2 - 5 cycle ) , separate least two hour . There 30 second rinse 5 % acetic acid , raspberry flavor , vinegar-like liquid , follow tap water rinse participant receive INGN 201 . Participants ask hold INGN 201 mouth 30 minute . Eating drinking avoid one hour receive mouth rinse . The injection rinse series repeat monthly basis period six month . Participants request two biopsy ( small tissue sample ) premalignant lesion take Day 5 1st 6th course . These biopsy contribute understand experimental agent work pre-cancerous cell . In particular , biopsy help determine experimental agent effective kill pre-cancerous cell ( process call apoptosis ) . These study also determine gene therapy injection effective deliver gene ( p53 ) precancerous cell . Participants observe three week sixth course treatment . At end study , 28 day last dose INGN 201 , participant physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . Participants medical history blood urine test . These test do monitor effect study treatment . Participants develop severe side effect take study , though may continue receive follow-up evaluation monitor health . Participants counsel physician lesion ( ) progress cancer study follow period . After counsel , participant may choose surgery remove precancerous lesion ( ) , laser surgery , observation . The participant monitor closely . Study participant follow five year , must agree stay contact personal doctor doctor responsible study even move study end . The participant 's personal doctor may ask provide information anticancer treatment receive study 's completion , well information patient 's overall health . This investigational study . This experimental use human gene example gene therapy . This first time adenovirus gene therapy use pre-cancerous condition . This first study use INGN 201 mouth rinse . A total 20 patient enrol M. D. Anderson . A maximum 51 subject enter multi-center study .</detailed_description>
