	<brief_summary>This pilot study , conduct National Cancer Institute Massachusetts General Hospital , investigate genetic factor contribute development chordoma people family . Chordoma rare , potentially fatal , slow-growing bone tumor derive remnant embryonic material . This study determine feasibility conduct large study aim identify new family multiple member affect chordoma study genetic basis disease . English-speaking person diagnose chordoma 18 year age younger treat Massachusetts General Hospital Department Radiation Oncology 1988 end study period may eligible protocol . The age range patient currently 5 month 33 year . Patients ( parent minor patient ) mail packet instruction complete follow procedure home : - Provide permission researcher obtain medical record relate patient 's chordoma serious medical condition , obtain piece patient 's stored tumor tissue . - Complete questionnaire patient 's close blood relative , include parent , brother , sister , distant relative chordoma cancer tumor start brain spine . The questionnaire also include demographic information , education , marital status , ethnicity , religion , household income . - Collect two sample cheek cell ( patient 6 year old ) . Patients ' packet include instruction material collect cell . Parents child 6 9 year old collect cell child 's mouth use sterile soft-bristled brush contain tube . They brush inside child 's cheek brush 30 second place brush back tube . They repeat procedure second brush . Patients 10 year age old rinse mouth 45 second mouthwash provide packet spit mouthwash collection container . They repeat procedure several hour later . All participant return sign permission form , questionnaire , cheek cell sample researcher pre-addressed stamp envelope , also provide packet .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chordoma Family Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chordoma rare , slow growing , potentially fatal bone tumor derive remnant vestigial ectopic notochord . It occur almost exclusively axial skeleton ( skull base , vertebra , sacrum coccyx ) , somewhat frequent male female , median age diagnosis 58.5 year , range early childhood 70 year . This typically sporadic tumor usually present advanced stage associate mortality high due local destruction distant metastasis . Recently , identify several family chordoma multiple relative pattern consistent transmission autosomal dominant trait . Using clinical genotyping information three family , map familial chordoma gene chromosome 7q33 . Now , need identify multiplex chordoma family participate study fine map clone gene . To , establish collaboration Dr. Norbert Liebsch , Department Radiation Oncology ( DRO ) , Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , Boston . Since 1975 , department treat ~500 patient chordoma skull base cervical spine world ; 400 patient speak English . The propose study pilot study base 80 English-speaking MGH chordoma patient diagnose age 18 year Dr. Liebsch physician record . We choose group Dr. Liebsch 's personal knowledge patient fact young age diagnosis may indicate increase genetic susceptibility chordoma . A major purpose pilot study determine feasibility conduct large study encompass remain ( ~320 ) English-speaking MGH chordoma patient . The major goal full study would identify new multiplex chordoma family participate clinical gene mapping study . The data collection component pilot study include 1 ) family medical history questionnaire complete patient/parent next kin person telephone , 2 ) collect buccal cell patient ~ age 6 year via mailed buccal cell collection kit , 3 ) abstract information patient 's past medical history DRO/MGH medical record , 4 ) obtain paraffin block slide chordoma/other primary cancer MGH Pathology Department relevant outside institution . DNA buccal cell tumor use molecular study . We re-contact family pilot study report chordoma astrocytoma least one blood relative MGH patient . If confirm diagnose invite select family member participate clinical gene map study conduct separate NIH approve protocol . We consider pilot study success 30- 35 80 chordoma patients/parents/next kin participate , OR identify new multiplex chordoma family willing participate clinical gene mapping study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All Englishspeaking person diagnose chordoma age 18 year less either MGH elsewhere , treat DRO , MGH 1988 end study period ( n =100 ) . Ages range 5 month 33 year . There age limit fo selfadministered questionnaire telephone interview parent complete behalf case less 18 year , collection buccal cell limited case older equal age 6 year .</criteria>
