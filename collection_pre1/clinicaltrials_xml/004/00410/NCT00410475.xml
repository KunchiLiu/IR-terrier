	<brief_summary>Researchers National Cancer Institute University Minnesota follow nationwide cohort 146,022 radiologic technologist since 1982 ( Boice 1992 ; Doody 1998 ; Mohan 2003 ; Sigurdson 2003 ) . This one large cohorts medical radiation worker study date ( Yoshinaga 2003 ) one substantial number woman ( 73 % female ) , extensive covariate data , incident death outcome , estimate occupational radiation dos . The overall study objective : quantify radiation dose-response cancer breast , thyroid , radiogenic site ; assess cancer risk associate genotypic , phenotypic , biologically measurable factor ; determine genetic variation modifies radiation-related cancer risk . More 110,000 technologist complete least one three comprehensive questionnaire survey administer last 20 year 18,500 decease . The First Survey mail 1984-1989 132,454 know living radiologic technologist , 90,305 ( 68 % ) complete survey ( Boice 1992 ) . The Second Survey mail 1993-1998 126,628 know living technologist , 90,972 ( 72 % ) complete questionnaire ( Sigurdson2003 ) . Both survey include detailed question employment radiologic technologist , family history cancer , reproductive history , height , weight , cancer risk factor ( alcohol tobacco use ) , history personal diagnostic therapeutic medical radiation procedure , information cancer health outcome . A third follow-up cohort recently complete . During 2003-2005 , Third Survey mail administer telephone 101,694 living cohort member complete least one two previous survey ; 73,838 technologist ( 73 % ) complete survey . This questionnaire elicit information medical outcome assess radiation-related risk , detail calendar-specific employment data refine occupational ionizing radiation dose estimate , behavioral residential history estimate lifetime ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation exposure . The large number woman estimate cumulative radiation dose specific organ ( e.g . breast ) ( Simon 2006 ; see Figure 7 Table 9 ) offer opportunity study effect low-dose radiation exposure breast thyroid cancer , two sensitive organ sit radiation carcinogenesis women.. We aware study population quantify radiation dos biospecimens available individual protract low-dose ionizing radiation exposure . Incorporation assessment role genetic polymorphism molecular variant DNA repair genetic pathway may functionally important radiation carcinogenesis would provide initial result possible role genetic factor cancer-radiation relationship . Because large number woman expose ubiquitous low-dose radiation occupational , medical , environmental source , presence radiation-sensitive genetic variant influence risk breast cancer would important public health implication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Radiation Epidemiology Branch University Minnesota follow nationwide cohort 146,022 U.S. radiologic technologist ( USRT ) since 1982 ass cancer disease risk associate long-term repeat low dos ionize radiation . The USRT Study large cohort medical radiation worker study date one substantial number woman , extensive covariate data , incident fatal cancer outcome , estimate individual historical occupational radiation dos , personal medical radiation dos , personal residential solar ultraviolet radiation ( UVR ) dose , biospecimens breast thyroid cancer case comparison subject . This cohort uniquely suit address outstanding scientific question difference risk relate nature radiation exposure , specifically whether risk single high-dose exposure ( e.g . atomic bomb , radiotherapy ) many small exposure time might mitigate DNA repair mechanism . The nationwide distribution cohort , wide-ranging UVR exposure , also offer rare opportunity evaluate risk non-melanoma skin cancer UVR , major focus study next year . OBJECTIVES : 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; Assess risk cancer diseases long-term low-dose occupational personal medical exposure . 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; Assess risk cancer diseases occupational exposure emerge evolve radiologic modality ( i.e . nuclear medicine , fluoroscopically-guided procedure ) . 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; Assess risk skin cancer solar ultraviolet radiation exposure . 4 . &lt; TAB &gt; Conduct discovery genetic determinant thyroid cancer rapid replication main genotype effect breast cancer . 5 . &lt; TAB &gt; Evaluate gene-radiation ionize radiation-ultraviolet radiation interaction . ELIGIBILITY : All radiologic technologist certify American Registry Radiologic Technologists least two year 1926-1982 eligible study . Excluded technologist reside outside U.S. DESIGN : Cohort study : The full USRT cohort consist 146,022 radiologic technologist . The cohort predominantly female ( 73 % ) , Caucasian ( 93 % ) , presently 67 year old average ; 83 % live 16 % decease presume decease . Three questionnaire survey conduct 1983-2005 collect information occupational , personal medical , personal ambient residential ultraviolet radiation exposure , cancer risk factor , cancer disease outcomes . More 110,000 technologist participate first and/or second survey . The recent follow-up ( third survey ) conduct 2003-2005 obtain detailed work history information improve occupational dosimetry . Enhanced estimate individual annual badge dose ( personal dose equivalent ) radiation absorb dose 12 organ tissue ( breast , thyroid , brain , red bone-marrow , lung , heart , ovary , colon , testis , skin extremity , skin head neck , lens eye ) recently complete survey participant . Linear dose-response analysis underway quantify risk protract low-dose radiation cancer ( e.g. , breast , thyroid ) radiation-related disease ( e.g. , cardiovascular , cataract ) . A fourth questionnaire survey development collect information cancer disease outcome , work history nuclear medicine fluoroscopically-guided procedure , risk factor . Fourth survey outcome use assess incident cancer risk UVR exposure data collect third survey . Collection blood buccal cell sample breast thyroid cancer case comparison subject continue . Future plan include case-control study basal cell carcinoma ass risk ultraviolet ionize radiation exposure , genetic variant , interaction .</detailed_description>
