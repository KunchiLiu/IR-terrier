	<brief_title>Resistance Exercise Already-active Diabetic Individuals ( READI ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Juvenile-onset type 1 ( insulin-dependent ) diabetes associate 15 year reduction life expectancy , primarily due cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Poor blood glucose ( glycemic ) control , reflect elevate hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) major risk factor diabetes complication ; 1 % absolute reduction HbA1c lead 15-20 % reduction risk major cardiovascular event , 25-37 % reduction risk microvascular disease . Exercise appeal potential non-pharmacological intervention improve glycemic control . However , aerobic exercise ( e.g . walking , run ) improve insulin sensitivity , publish study find aerobic exercise improve glycemic control type 1 diabetes . This paradoxical finding likely due tendency type 1 diabetic individual decrease insulin dos and/or increase carbohydrate intake necessary order avoid exercise-induced hypoglycemia . In comparison aerobic exercise , small acute rise glucose uptake associate resistance exercise may offer metabolic benefit exercise minimize risk exercise-induced hypoglycemia . Only two small publish study ( n=8 10 ; men ) evaluate resistance exercise ( weight lifting exercise weight machine ) type 1 diabetes , result promise . In crossover trial , glycemic control significantly well resistance train non-exercise control ( HbA1c 5.8 % versus 6.9 % ; absolute difference 1.1 % ) . In before-after study , combine aerobic resistance exercise reduce absolute HbA1c 0.96 % . People type 1 diabetes already regular aerobic exercise would likely open start additional form exercise proven improve glycemic control . We therefore wish evaluate incremental effect resistance training HbA1c already-aerobically-active type 1 diabetic individual randomize , control trial . Primary research question : In type 1 diabetic individual already engage regular aerobic exercise , add 6-month resistance training program result improve glycemic control reflect reduced HbA1c compare aerobic train alone ? Secondary research question : In type 1 diabetic individual already regular aerobic exercise , add 6-month resistance training program favourable effect body composition , non-traditional traditional CVD risk factor , quality life vs. aerobic exercise alone ? Exploratory research question : What incremental effect resistance training insulin requirement frequency hypoglycemia ? Do change glycemic control , body composition , quality life resistance train intervention predict exercise participation subsequent 6 month ? How cost-effective add resistance train program ? Methods : Type 1 diabetic subject age &amp; # 8805 ; 16 yr perform aerobic exercise &amp; # 8805 ; 3 time per week resistance exercise , recruit three centre ( Ottawa , Toronto Calgary ) . They first enter 5-week run-in period , include 3X/week supervised low-intensity resistance exercise training week 2-5 . During run-in , addition verify adherence exercise program , intense effort make optimize diabetes care include frequent interaction study diabetes nurse/educator dietitian , intensification adjustment insulin therapy . Subjects attend &amp; # 8805 ; 80 % exercise session demonstrate good compliance diabetes care run-in randomize either resistance training wait list control week 6-26 ; either case continue aerobic exercise usual volume intensity support Exercise Specialist , use pedometer report exercise activity log . Resistance exercise training intervention group progress 3 set 8 rep 8 exercise 8RM ( maximum weight lift 8 time maintain proper form ) . Background diabetes care provide throughout , protocolized manner exercise control subject , insulin adjustment do study research staff . Significance : Reduced risk long-term complication type 1diabetes tightly link well glycemic control , often difficult achieve . This study provide valuable information regard extent resistance exercise improve glycemic control important risk factor complication people type 1 diabetes already aerobically active .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Type 1 diabetes mellitus define 2003 CDA guideline duration &amp; # 8805 ; 1 year , require insulin therapy start within one year diagnosis continuously thereafter . Male female , age &amp; # 8805 ; 16 year , HbA1c 0.0660.099 ( normal nondiabetic range 0.0400.060 ) . Habitual performance previous 4 month exercise &amp; # 8805 ; 3 time per week , include least 90 minute per week vigourous aerobic exercise ( sufficient intensity cause sweating ; e.g . jogging , soccer , basketball , racquet sport ) , and/or &amp; # 8805 ; 150 minute per week aerobic exercise least moderate intensity ( e.g . brisk walking , moderatepaced bicycling ) resistance training . Subjects must agree maintain habitual volume intensity aerobic activity runin intervention period , minimize variation due season , permit vary specific exercise choose . Willingness ability work closely study physician , nurse dietitian follow recommendation insulin therapy adjustment diet . Participation previous 4 month resistance training . Hypoglycemia unawareness , severe hypoglycemia require assistance another person within previous 3 month `` Brittle '' diabetes , characterize frequent unpredictable hypoglycemia ( even require assistance others ) hyperglycemia .

Cognitive deficit result inability understand comply instruction . Pregnancy start study , intention become pregnant next year . Inability communicate English French . Ischemic ECG change baseline maximal cardiopulmonary stress test , unless subsequently clear participation cardiologist appropriate investigation . Low aerobic fitness : Aerobic fitness 15 % mean age gender , base baseline maximal treadmill exercise test . This criterion include order reduce likelihood candidate enter trial exaggerate habitual activity . Very people engage regular aerobic activity would low treadmill performance .
