	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose eribulin mesylate gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , eribulin mesylate gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) E7389 ( eribulin mesylate ) give combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) patient advanced cancer . II . Determine safety , tolerability , toxicity profile E7389 gemcitabine give combination . III . Assess antitumor activity E7389 combination gemcitabine patient measurable disease . IV . Determine pharmacokinetic profile E7389 gemcitabine ass possible interaction two agent . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 OR day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 28 21 days* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos eribulin mesylate gemcitabine hydrochloride maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . NOTE : *If DLT observe first dose level 28-day schedule , subsequent patient treat day 1 8 21-day schedule ; patient enrol expansion cohort ( patient ovarian endometrial cancer chemotherapy-naive minimally pre-treated cancer ) receive treatment accord 21-day schedule . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
