	<brief_title>BATTLE Program : Erlotinib Previously Treated Subjects With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity enzyme find surface many tumor cell may slow tumor growth . In order enroll study , must also enrol Protocol 2005-0823 : A Biomarker-integrated study Chemorefractory Patients Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer . Protocol 2005-0823 screening study group study call BATTLE program . Participants Protocol 2005-0823 assigned one research study . The result tumor analysis help study doctor determine assign particular research study . While study , take erlotinib hydrochloride mouth day . Tablets take preferably morning 1 hour 2 hour meal 7 ounce water . If unable swallow tablet , may dissolve tablet distilled water . If forget take dose , last miss dose take soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose due take . The next day , take schedule dose usual time . Every attempt make keep vomiting medication least 30 minute take . For example , feel nauseated take erlotinib , anti-nausea medication use . The dose erlotinib hydrochloride may repeat vomit occurs within 30 minute take tablet . Four ( 4 ) week consider 1 treatment cycle . Every 4 week , complete medical history record physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature , breathe rate ) weight . You blood draw ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test . You performance status evaluation ( question ability perform everyday activity ) . Your study doctor ask medication take smoke history . Every 2 cycle , tumor evaluate chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate status disease . If take warfarin , blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clot function weekly first 5 week treatment every cycle . You may continue receive erlotinib hydrochloride long cancer respond study treatment . Your doctor may decide take study experience intolerable side effect , medical condition get bad , unable comply study requirement . If stop study treatment , may able enroll 1 remain 3 protocols BATTLE program . You discuss doctor . After stop take study treatment , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You also blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clotting function . You performance status evaluation , chest x-ray , CT MRI scan . Following evaluation , contact telephone every 3 month 3 year , see . You right leave study time . If choose stop participating study , contact study chair and/or research nurse . Your doctor may decide take study medical condition get bad and/or unable comply study requirement . This investigational study . Erlotinib hydrochloride approve FDA treatment NSCLC patient relapse . Up 72 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
