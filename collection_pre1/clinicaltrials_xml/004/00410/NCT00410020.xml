	<brief_summary>An alpha linolenic acid ( ALA ) rich diet Lyon Diet Heart Study reduce sudden cardiac death possibly reduce cardiac arrhythmia ventricular fibrillation ( Lancet 1994 ) . Since , grow interest ALA , ω-3 fatty acid family precursor , cardioprotective nutrient . Much interest focus potential antiarrhythmic effect longer chain ω-3 fatty acid , DHA EPA , derive fish . We therefore conclude important test wether vegetable source ω-3 also antiarrhythmic effect , show animal Leaf McLennan , since might also explain beneficial effect see cardiovascular mortality Lyon Diet Heart Study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine effect ALA rich diet reduce recurrence atrial fibrillation example cardiac arrhythmia . Design : Randomized parallel design efficacy study . Setting : Three university hospital center Bordeaux region , France . Patients : 98 patient randomize immediately successful atrial fibrillation electrical cardioversion . Intervention : A canola margarine oil , versus conventional diet ( control ) , one year follow-up . Main outcome measure : Length time first recurrence atrial fibrillation . Significance : If ALA antiarrhythmic , action may explain cardioprotective effect clinical trial cohort study .</detailed_description>
