	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Eluting Covered Metallic Stent Unresectable Malignant Bile Duct Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.1 Self-expandable metallic stent ( SEMS ) Self-expandable metallic stent ( SEMS ) placement well-established widely use treatment patient unresectable malignant biliary obstruction . This palliative technique prolongs survival , shorten hospital stay , improve quality life patient unresectable malignant biliary obstruction . Unfortunately , SEMS disadvantage occlusion time tumor ingrowth ( tumor invasion metal wire mesh stent ) overgrowth ( tumor grow end stent ) , mucosal hyperplasia consequence chronic irritation . The occlusion rate SEMS vary 10 % 50 % case malignant biliary obstruction . 6-9 Duration SEMS patency important patient short life-expectancy quality life cost-effectiveness mainly determine stent occlusion . Previous study suggest covered metallic stent may prevent tumor ingrowth reduce occlusion rate , tumor overgrowth still problematic . 11 12 13 Therefore , dire need metallic stent prevents tumor ingrowth overgrowth . 1.2 . Paclitaxel Paclitaxel potent antineoplastic drug extract bark pacific yew ( Taxus brevifolia ) utilize therapy ovarian , breast , lung , cancer . This potent drug exerts pharmacological effect unique mechanism . Paclitaxel cause formation numerous decentralize unorganized microtubule enhance assembly extraordinarily stable dysfunctional microtubule . In addition , inhibit activation process like activation protein kinases release transcription factor . In addition , paclitaxel several pharmacokinetic characteristic make well suit locoregional cancer therapy . It rapid cellular uptake first pas effect extremely lipophilic character long lasting action broad concentration range . Furthermore , paclitaxel antiangiogenic antimetastatic property . The efficacy dose dependent inhibition cell proliferation human gallbladder epithelial cell , fibroblast , pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell make paclitaxel promise substance local drug delivery reduce proliferative migratory component involve tumor growth . This inhibitory effect paclitaxel cell line serve basis develop drug-eluting stent malignant biliary stricture . 1.3 . Paclitaxel-eluting cover metallic stent Covering stent chemotherapeutic agent , paclitaxel , give protection tumor ingrowth , overgrowth , result increased patency , long survival rate increase remain quality life . There study effect paclitaxel-eluting cover metallic stent animal bile duct . In study porcine bile duct , degree histologic change , include inflammatory cell infiltration fibrous reaction , correspond amount paclitaxel incorporate within stent . The degree inflammatory change severe porcine bile duct contact stent 20 % concentration ( % wt/v ) paclitaxel stent 10 % concentration . There case transmural necrosis perforation . The result particular study serve basis research . In preliminary study , significant complication perforation stent migration occur either DDS CS group . Therefore , suggest paclitaxel-eluting SEMS safe normal canine bile duct .</detailed_description>
