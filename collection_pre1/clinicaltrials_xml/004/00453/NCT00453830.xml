	<brief_summary>Aim : This prospective , randomized comparison traditional open ( OS ) laparoscopic sigmoidectomy ( LS ) patient complicate diverticular disease . The study design order minimize bias standardize two procedure blind patient nurse preoperative early postoperative period . Hypothesis : A laparoscopic approach sigmoidectomy significant advantage open technique respect postoperative pain , duration ileus , length hospital stay , perioperative morbidity . Methods : Patients complicate diverticular disease candidate elective sigmoidectomy randomize day surgery , anaesthetic technique postoperative management standardize group . Surgeons experience laparoscopic-assisted open colectomy perform type procedure . At end operation , identical , opaque wound dressing apply left place postoperative day 4 . Both patient nurse staff therefore blind type surgical technique early postoperative period . Endpoints : A ) Postoperative pain assess Visual Analog Scale postoperative day 1 , 2 , 3 . B ) Postoperative intake systemic opiate ( morphine ) C ) Duration postoperative ileus , quantify interval hour end procedure passage first stool . D ) Duration hospital stay . E ) Surgical complication , wound infection , anastomotic leakage , bleed F ) General medical complication , cardiopulmonary , pneumonia , renal failure . Rationale : This study determine whether laparoscopic sigmoidectomy associate significant clinical advantage traditional open approach patient complicate diverticular disease blind operative technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colonic diverticulosis increasingly common condition Western society ; country , third population affect 6th decade two-thirds 9th decade . Fortunately , majority patient diverticulosis remain asymptomatic ; diverticulitis , common presentation complicate diverticular disease , estimate incidence 10 patient per 100,000/year . Colonic diverticular disease usually restrict sigmoid colon , conservative treatment antibiotic indicate case first attack uncomplicated diverticulitis , rationale majority patient treat first episode acute inflammation eventually recover problem . Elective sigmoidectomy currently recommend follow clinical situation : 1 . Patients two episode uncomplicated diverticulitis . 2 . Patients one episode complicate ( perforate ) diverticulitis , either pericolic pelvic abscess ( Hinchey stage I II respectively ) , fistula formation and/or stenosis . Resection sigmoid colon commonly perform laparoscopy , number non-randomized publication demonstrate approach safe feasible patient diverticular disease . The theoretical advantage celioscopy open technique include decreased postoperative pain , short duration postoperative ileus hospital stay , improve cosmetic . Surprisingly , however , publish data topic restrict case-control series , far putative advantage laparoscopy substantiate prospective randomize trial .</detailed_description>
