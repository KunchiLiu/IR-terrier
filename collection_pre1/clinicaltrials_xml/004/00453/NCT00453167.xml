	<brief_summary>As single agent , paclitaxel response rate 33 % 25-29 % SCLC patient sensitive relapse resistant relapse , respectively . As single agent , gemcitabine also response rate 16 % 6-13 % SCLC patient sensitive relapse resistant relapse , respectively . Because single-agent activity , different mechanism action , non-overlapping toxicity , beneficial pharmacologic interaction , paclitaxel gemcitabine combination attractive test clinical trial .</brief_summary>
