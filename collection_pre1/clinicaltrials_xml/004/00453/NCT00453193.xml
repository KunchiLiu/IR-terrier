	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Pentostatin In T-cell Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alemtuzumab antibody protein direct towards marker molecule surface B- T- lymphoid cell . It currently approve use treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia study treat patient number T-cell malignancy . Alemtuzumab find effective condition . Pentostatin drug approve treat patient hairy cell leukemia , B-cell malignancy . Pentostatin also study number T-cell cancer find effective . The purpose study see whether combine drug prove effective . If find eligible take part study , receive pentostatin central venous catheter vein week 4 week every 2 week achievement best response . A central venous catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your physician explain procedure detail require sign separate consent form procedure . Alemtuzumab also give vein catheter Days 1 , 2 , 3 . The dose alemtuzumab receive increase day first 3 day make sure tolerate . It give three time per week achieve best response . If develop reaction alemtuzumab give vein , may receive injection dose skin . During treatment , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw week first 4 week routine blood test . These blood test repeat every 2 4 week remainder study . At end treatment bone marrow examination repeat document response . Also , chest X-ray CT scan , repeat confirm level response . The maximum amount time alemtuzumab give 3 month . The maximum amount time pentostatin give 6 month . You may able receive treatment local oncologist . However , close follow-up M. D. Anderson . You take treatment disease get bad treatment unacceptable side effect develop . You continue follow either directly telephone evaluate long-term response treatment study . This investigational study . Both alemtuzumab pentostatin commercially approve drug use treat T-cell malignancy . A total 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . This investigational study . Both alemtuzumab pentostatin commercially approve drug use treat T-cell malignancy . A total 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
