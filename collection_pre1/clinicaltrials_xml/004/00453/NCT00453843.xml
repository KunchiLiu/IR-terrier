	<brief_summary>We test person chronic impairment due stroke : 1. whether order robot therapy deliver influence outcome ( shoulder-and-elbow wrist vs. wrist shoulder-and-elbow ) . 2. whether train shoulder , elbow , wrist time different day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shoulder , Elbow , Wrist : What Should Train First After Stroke ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Effect Proximal Distal Training Stroke Recovery : Specific Aim 1 . Test whether task specific wrist robotic training improves motor performance among person chronic impairment stroke . Specific Aim 2 . Test whether order robot therapy deliver influence outcome ( shoulder-and-elbow wrist vs. wrist shoulder-and-elbow ) . Specific Aim 3 . Test whether generalization across different joint ( shoulder &amp; elbow v wrist ) . Specific Aim 4 : Test whether interference training across different joint among person chronic impairment stroke . Briefly invite person chronic impairment due stroke participate study train first wrist 6 week shoulder-and-elbow additional 6 week vice-versa . A third group train alternate day 12 week shoulder-and-elbow wrist , fourth group train shoulder , elbow , wrist day . Outcomes measure use standard instrument well robot-based measure . We expect result study provide objective basis maximize kind therapy .</detailed_description>
