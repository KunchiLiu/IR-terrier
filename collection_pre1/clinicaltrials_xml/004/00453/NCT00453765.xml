	<brief_title>The Effect Montelukast Patients With Chronic Cough Bronchial Hyperreactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic cough frequent problem general practice one common reason referral respiratory clinic . Prospective study show vast majority case chronic cough due one three condition : rhinitis/postnasal drip syndrome , asthma gastro-oesophageal reflux disease . Other significant cause chronic cough include postviral ( post-infectious ) cough , eosinophilic bronchitis . In minority patient chronic cough cause find . This call idiopathic cough . Analysis treatment patient chronic cough often prove difficult disappointing . Nevertheless , center comprehensive diagnostic therapeutic protocol implement report excellent result . Therefore first cough clinic start The Isala Klinieken , Zwolle/The Netherlands 2004 . Asthmatic cough often accompany typical symptom dyspnoea wheeze . In subgroup asthmatic , however , cough sole predominant symptom . This condition term cough-variant asthma ( CVA ) . Cough due CVA usually improve within first week inhale bronchodilator therapy , however , complete resolution cough may require 8 week combination therapy inhale bronchodilator corticosteroid . A subgroup CVA patient severe , refractory cough may require systemic ( oral ) steroid , alone follow inhaled therapy . Leukotrienes contribute significantly pathobiology asthma . These 'pathways asthma ' could suppress leukotriene inhibitor . Multiple clinical trial demonstrate ability leukotriene modifier improve symptom , pulmonary function bronchial hyperresponsiveness chronic asthma , well exercise-induced aspirin-induced asthma . Until recently , antitussive effect drug class investigate properly . Spector Tan conclude pilot trial 14 patient 10 mg montelukast seem effective CVA . However , nowadays care asthma , montelukast widely use dosage 10 mg . Therefore intend study effect montelukast chronic cough ( VAS-cough-score ) wider patient population ; montelukast superior placebo treatment patient chronic cough demonstrate bronchial hyperreactivity ? Aim study : The purpose determine whether montelukast 6 week superior antitussive effect ( measure VAS cough ) compare placebo patient cough last &gt; 8 week enhance bronchial hyperreactivity . Study design : Montelukast trial : prospective single-centre , double blind randomise trial . In montelukast study 84 patient 18 90 year old , refer cough outpatient clinic chronic cough enhance bronchial hyperreactivity recruit informed consent obtain . Patients randomise ( gender , age , smoking , duration symptom use inhaled corticosteroid ) 6- week treatment 10 mg daily montelukast placebo . Before randomisation patient fill Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) detection degree cough last 24 hour dutch version Leicester Cough Questionnaire ( LCQ ) detection illness specific quality life . Adverse event note period . Finally , group compare . Inhaled corticosteroid may continue study constant dose . Nasal , ophthalmologic dermatological steroid allow accord individual need , dose keep constant throughout trial . H1 blocker , nasal anticholinergic well nasal ophthalmologic preparation nedocromil cromoglycate permit treatment allergic rhinitis . Study population : Patients 18 90 year old , refer cough outpatient clinic chronic cough enhance bronchial hyperreactivity . Intervention : Patients 16 90 year old , refer cough outpatient clinic chronic cough enhance bronchial hyperreactivity receive daily montelukast 10 mg placebo 6 week . Main study endpoint : 1 . Difference cough VAS score ; montelukast v placebo . Secondary study endpoint : 1 . Difference average score Leicester Cough Questionaire ( LCQ ) two treatment group ; montelukast v placebo . 2 . Comparison adverse event montelukast vs placebo . Randomisation : Patients randomise computer minimisation program follow factor : gender , age , smoking , duration symptom use inhaled corticosteroid . Statistical analysis : The primary analysis intention-to-treat basis . The mean change primary endpoint ( LCQ total domain score ) 6 week group analyse use unpaired t-test . This test also use analyse difference 6 week secondary endpoint ( VAS cough score ) . Since primary secondary endpoint study measure two time ( repeatedly measure ) course score time test use MANOVA-analysis . To test difference proportion ( proportion patient adverse event ) Chi2 -test use . Data analysis perform use SPSS version 12 . Burden , risk advantage associate participation : Side effect report 10 % case ; mostly headache abdominal pain . Also gastrointestinal problem , allergic reaction , psychiatric disorder , liver , haematological disorder could occur . Interactions : Montelukast metabolise CYP3A4 . Concomitant use CYP3A4 induce medication like fenytoïne , phenobarbital , rifampicin must prevent . Medication metabolise CYP2C8 must also avoid , vitro study show montelukast powerful CYP2C8 inhibitor . Benefits : superior resolution cough compare placebo .</detailed_description>
