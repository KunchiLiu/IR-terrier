	<brief_summary>Although first randomize trial patient advance ACC lead establishment first line cytotoxic chemotherapy ongoing ( FIRM-ACT ) , failure rate even FIRM-ACT study likely clearly 50 % . Therefore , majority participate patient urgently need new treatment option . However , date evidence single regimen might promise treatment-refractory patient ACC . Sunitinib oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor anti-tumor antiangiogenic activity , successfully test treatment patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma , gastrointestinal stromal neuroendocrine tumor failure standard cytotoxic chemotherapy . The primary objective trial estimate response ( defined progression-free survival ≥ 12 week ) rate associate Sunitinib treatment patient advance ACC progress cytotoxic chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
