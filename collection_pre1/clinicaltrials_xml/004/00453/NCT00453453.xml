	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize patient admit emergency department ( ED ) observation unit decreased rate hospital admission ED recidivism treat nesiritide versus standard therapy . The investigator also hypothesize decrease B-type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) level treatment ED observation unit predict improve patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BNP Therapy Observation Unit Outcomes STudy ( BOOST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) grow problem United States . The increase number decompensated heart failure patient present emergency department ( ED ) treatment worsen burden already strain limited health care resource . In addition , many patient return ED treatment within three month treat decompensated heart failure . The emergence ED observation unit provide viable cost effective alternative inpatient treatment many disease include CHF . It show intensive , directed therapy ED observation unit decrease revisit rate CHF patient . In addition , introduction nesiritide show promising result treatment decompensated congestive heart failure . The primary aim study compare nesiritide versus standard heart failure therapy ED setting . A secondary aim determine serial BNP level observation unit stay predict clinical outcome . The treatment heart failure ED place tremendous burden already limited resource . The cost treatment well morbidity mortality associate disease worsen predict increase general population age . The ability safely treat discharge patient ED observation unit reduce return visit would invaluable manage grow number heart failure patient .</detailed_description>
