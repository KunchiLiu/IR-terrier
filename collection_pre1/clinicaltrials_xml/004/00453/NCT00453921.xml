	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) significant public health problem , 1.5-2.0 million Americans injured year . Cognitive deficit , particularly domains memory attention frequently source linger disability TBI source enormous distress injured individual family/caregivers . To date , intervention ameliorate chronic cognitive deficit direct either pharmacological intervention cognitive rehabilitation . We propose ( 1 ) To compare efficacy three intervention : memory attention training ( MAAT ) , methylphenidate , memory/attention training combination methylphenidate ( 2 ) use functional MRI ( fMRI ) characterize change activation neural circuitry memory attention due MAAT alone , methylphenidate alone , MAAT combination methylphenidate . This two two design medication ( methylphenidate/placebo ) cognitive therapy ( Memory Attention Training ( MAAT ) Attention control intervention ) possible intervention . Using randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind design , 200 individual persistent cognitive deficit 6-12 month MTBI randomize receive six week trial either ( 1 ) MAAT placebo , ( 2 ) MAAT methylphenidate ( 0.3 mg/kg BID ) , ( 3 ) attention control intervention methylphenidate ( 0.3 mg/kg BID ) , ( 4 ) attention control intervention placebo . Symptom distress , attention memory performance , activation pattern neural circuitry attention memory undergoing fMRI characterize baseline , four treatment condition . This study provide important information three intervention disable sequelae enormous public health problem . Further , help clarify underlying neural mechanism suggest additional treatment possibility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary Gaps Addressed Proposed Study What know : There two intervention promise efficacy ameliorate deficit attention memory mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) : ( ) memory attention training/rehabilitation , ( ii ) catecholaminergic augmentation ( particularly methylphenidate - augments dopaminergic adrenergic system ) . fMRI functional imaging strategy provide valuable insight underlie neural mechanism cognitive enhance effect methylphenidate neuropsychiatric population ( individual ADHD ) , effect cognitive rehabilitation effort domain ( e.g . speech language individual stroke ) . What know : To date study apply psychopharmacological strategy augment neurotransmitter system know modulate memory/attention ( dopaminergic adrenergic system ) combination cognitive rehabilitation intervention know improve memory/attention ( memory/attention training ) individual MTBI . We aware publish study use fMRI assess neural mechanism memory/attention improvement use catecholaminergic agent memory/attention training individual MTBI . It important determine efficacy combine memory/attention train methylphenidate . It equally important begin understand neural mechanism underlie effective treatment may help inform development next generation intervention perhaps lead individually tailor treatment intervention . This proposal start address gap knowledge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age : Individuals age 1865 sustained mild severe TBI 4 month prior study entry . 2 . TBI : Subjects must sustain traumatic blow head , result either alteration level consciousness ( manifest daze confused amnesia event ) loss consciousness ( LOC ) . Duration LOC estimate use available information include patient witness report , emergency personnel record Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center ( DHMC ) medical record . Post traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) estimate careful question patient determine time return continuous memory . This informed review medical record . We plan include individual intracranial skull injury stem TBI , provide meet inclusion criterion . Such lesion catalogue , include factor data analysis . 3 . Cognitive Deficits : Subjects either subjective objective evidence persistent cognitive deficit . Subjects must report persistent memory attention deficit result injury , sufficient severity interfere social and/or occupational functioning . Subjects must either score 2 standard deviation age adjust norm estimate baseline premorbid function one test attention and/or memory administer part baseline screen cognitive battery ( see ) , score great 1.0 standard deviation either age adjust norm estimate premorbid function 2 screening test . The following factor exclude otherwise eligible subject participation : 1. history neurologic disorder ( epilepsy , cerebrovascular disease , mental retardation , neurodegenerative disorder ) 2. significant systemic medical illness clinically significant liver disease , renal disease , atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease , hypertension require medication management 3. current Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSMIV ) Axis I diagnosis psychiatric illness substance abuse . We give careful consideration inclusion latter group give use stimulant potential abuse property . Because potential crossover abuse cocaine , amphetamine , stimulant , individual history exclude study . Individuals history otherwise uncomplicated ethanol nonstimulant drug abuse currently stable remission eligible . The Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV ( MINI ) use screen psychiatric illness 4. woman currently pregnant lactate . Female participant ask take pregnancy test confirm currently pregnant .</criteria>
