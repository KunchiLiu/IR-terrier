	<detailed_description>Growth retardation well know patient severe form juvenile idiopathic arthritis . Especially additional treatment glucocorticoid high disease activity . This case patient polyarticular systemic form juvenile idiopathic arthritis . The permanent consequence short stature final height . Up 30 % patient final height 3rd percentile , even discontinuation glucocorticoid treatment . The hypothesis , treatment growth hormone , leat part , overcome growth hormone resistance state increase final height . In controlled study follow patient juvenile idiopathic arthritis without growth hormone treatment final height . From safety aspect interested effect growth hormone disease activity . Additionally , interested bone density development treat growth hormone final height .</detailed_description>
