	<detailed_description>Unfortunately , despite best clinical effort breakthrough biotechnology , patient diagnose advanced stage lung cancer continue die disease . Reasons include : 1 ) patient often diagnosed time lung cancer already spread site chest cavity , bone , lung , liver , brain limiting option local radiation therapy surgery , 2 ) cancer cell resistant become resistant chemotherapy drug use treat patient . Resistance one type chemotherapy agent often rapidly lead resistance many chemotherapy drug . These reason major cause cancer progression usually discuss consider treatment option patient disease continue grow spread . However , another important part body consider -- immune system . Scientists clearly show lung cancer cell produce number abnormal protein abnormal amount certain protein find normal lung cell . Normally one would expect patient develop immune response abnormal protein find cancer attack much way would fight infection foreign bacteria virus . However , reason scientist fully understand , immune system fail respond abnormal proteins attack lung cancer cell . This human clinical trial propose new way make immune system recognize cancer encourage attack cancer cell . Many people familiar idea transplant people organ like kidney heart . When organ transplant two people complete one problem occur rejection donate organ recipient . This occur immune system patient receive organ attack donate organ . If attempt transplant pig heart human rejection would dramatically strong organ transplant two people . This partly low animal express sugar-protein pattern surface cell human . In fact , immune system quickly recognize tissue low mammal pig mouse destroys . In project , put mouse gene human lung cancer cell produce abnormal sugar pattern stimulate immune system attack lung cancer . This strategy work well kill human cancer cell laboratory , need tried lung cancer patient see effective determine treatment cause side effect . We propose test new treatment subject non-small cell lung cancer see stop , slow destroy tumor subject . Subjects inject anti-tumor vaccine consist mixture three type dead human lung cancer cell genetically alter express mouse gene responsible make abnormal sugar-protein cell .</detailed_description>
