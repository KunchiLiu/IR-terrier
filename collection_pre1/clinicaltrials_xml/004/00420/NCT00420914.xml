	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Platelet transfusion play major role management thrombocytopenic patient . Platelet transfusion may give either absence hemorrhage ( prophylactic transfusion ) , control bleeding ( therapeutic transfusion ) . Prophylactic platelet transfusion therapy commonly use patient decreased marrow platelet production ( hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia ) account majority platelet transfuse patient . As platelet use continue increase rate disproportionately higher red cell , important identify cost-effective strategy provide platelet support . The two important factor - within control order physician - significantly influence total amount platelet transfuse : 1. prophylactic platelet transfusion `` trigger '' select transfusion ; 2. number platelet give per transfusion . The optimal quantity platelet use per transfusion remain highly controversial subject . No prospective platelet transfusion trial perform patient randomize assigned platelet dose throughout period thrombocytopenia evaluate effect different dos transfusion outcomes . INTRODUCTION : A randomized prospective platelet dose trial propose determine safe , efficient , cost-effective dosing strategy transfuse platelet . The trial design answer two fundamental question : 1 ) Are low dose platelet transfusion inferior standard dose platelet transfusion patient chemotherapy induce thrombocytopenia measure frequency WHO bleed Grade 2 great ; 2 ) How dose platelet transfuse affect interval platelet transfusion event , , thereby , total number platelet transfuse ? GENERAL OBJECTIVE : To evaluate hemostatic efficacy low dose platelet transfusion . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : This non-inferiority study design determine low dose prophylactic platelet transfusion transfuse patient chemotherapy induce thrombocytopenia without increase frequency WHO bleeding ( Grade 2 great ) compare current transfusion strategy use standard dose platelet product . The low dose platelet transfusion target 2.25 x 10^11 platelets/transfusion ( range 1.5-2.9 x 10^11/product ) . The standard dose platelet transfusion target 4.5 x 10^11 platelets/transfusion ( range 3.0-6.0 x 10^11/ product ) STUDY DESIGN : This multicenter prospective randomize control trial eligible patient randomize receive low dose standard dose prophylactic platelet transfusion . Patients transfuse prophylactically use transfusion trigger platelet count equal level 10 x 10^9/L ( 10,000/uL ) high trigger ( dependant transfusion guideline set individual institution ) . Clinical evidence bleed assessed daily accord WHO classification bleeding . Study personnel involve daily hemostatic assessment patient blind patient 's randomization assignment . The grade bleeding assign use Adjudication Committee blind treatment patient receiving . Each patient follow throughout period thrombocytopenia . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) establish comprise two hematologist associate study , one critical care physician , biostatistician . Three individual experience serve Data Safety Monitoring Boards expertise clinical research methodology . The DSMB receive review adverse event regular report . The information report blind designate treatment group A B. STRATIFICATION : There two level stratification study . The first level stratification center center difference chemotherapy bone marrow stem cell transplant protocol use . The second level stratification diagnostic grouping : bone marrow/stem cell transplant ; non transplant patient . TREATMENT ALLOCATION : Eligible patient give write consent , randomize treatment arm require first prophylactic platelet transfusion . INTERVENTION : Patients randomize one two prophylactic platelet transfusion strategy either low dose standard dose . At time platelet transfusion , platelet count perform product weight platelet bag record absolute number platelet give platelet transfusion calculate . Either apheresis platelet whole blood derive platelet concentrate use achieve require platelet dose base product availability preferences patient 's physician . PERIOD OF FOLLOW-UP : Study patient follow throughout period thrombocytopenia bone marrow recovery occur ( platelet count ≥ 50 x10^9/L ( 50,000/uL ) patient study 30 day , withdraws consent , die discharge hospital set allow daily assessment bleeding . SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS : WHO Grade 3 4 bleeding consider serious adverse event monitor throughout study . These serious adverse event report data coordinate center relevant IRB within 24 hour . ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : There two analysis perform : first compare proportion patient treatment group Grade 2 great bleeding : second recurrent event analysis use strategy include proportion patient bleed , number bleed occur timing bleed ( i.e . whether occurs early late period thrombocytopenia ) .</detailed_description>
