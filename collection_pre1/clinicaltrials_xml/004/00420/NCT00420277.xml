	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Hemospan superior Voluven treatment hypotensive episode perioperative period ( induction spinal anesthesia 6 hour skin closure ) , reduce incidence operative postoperative complication include organ dysfunction failure follow-up one month follow surgery . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) periodically evaluate safety data collect trial</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study HemospanÂ® Treating Hypotension Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemospan novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier develop perfuse oxygenate tissue risk ischemia hypoxia . As result molecular size oxygen bind characteristic , Hemospan selectively off-loads oxygen tissue predispose low oxygen tension . Preclinical evidence suggest Hemospan provide rapid effective plasma expansion tissue perfusion , property Hemospan target oxygen release microcirculation . Spinal anesthesia preferred choice hip arthroplasty procedure elderly patient , associate functional hypovolemia due loss vascular tone frequently cause acute hypotensive episode . Hypotension represent surrogate marker hypovolemia may exacerbate surgical bleeding , result decrease cardiac output , insufficient perfusion inadequate tissue oxygenation . Ischemia result hypotension adversely affect vital organ function may result complication postoperative morbidity . As population age patient become candidate orthopedic reconstruction joint replacement surgery , number patient risk increase . The ideal IV solution treat hypovolemia-associated hypotension improve hemodynamic stability would effective plasma expander promote tissue perfusion delivers oxygen ischemic marginally hypoxic tissue . Preclinical animal study show Hemospan may well-suited application may even better blood situation . Data Sangart 's Phase II orthopedic surgery study ( No . 6055 ) , publish recently Olofsson et al . ( Anesthesiology 2006 ; 105 ( 6 ) :1153-63 ) support safety potential benefit Hemospan prevent treat hypotension orthopedic surgery patient undergo hip replacement surgery spinal anesthesia .</detailed_description>
