	<brief_summary>The five-year goal project investigate effect in-shoe wedge orthoses low extremity function patient knee osteoarthritis . In general , aim address immediate effect orthoses , long-term effect orthoses , immediate long-term treatment effect compare medial versus lateral wedge orthoses . The investigator hypothesize wedge orthosis result alter gait mechanic reflect reduction knee joint force , reduce knee joint pain increase function weight bearing activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : In shoe wedge orthoses show effective conservative approach reduce pain patient osteoarthritis ( OA ) . The mechanism responsible pain reduction well-understood . It know whether place medial lateral wedge shoe result alteration low extremity alignment , knee joint moment combination two . In addition , suggest patient lateral knee joint OA ( treat medial wedge ) respond favorably commonly diagnose medial knee joint OA . Finally , longterm effect intervention OA patient ' functional status well progression OA study . Therefore , purpose study examine effect in-shoe wedge orthoses patient knee OA static alignment measure , dynamic low extremity mechanic functional measure . In addition , longterm effect treatment also examine . Methods : 120 patient age 40-70 yr knee OA ( grades I-IV ) recruit within medical community . Subjects diagnosis unilateral knee OA great 3 month duration , define American College Rheumatology Guidelines , include . 60 subject medial joint OA 60 lateral joint OA recruit . 30 subject within group assign treatment control group group balance term OA severity ( determine grade ) . The treatment group receive custom mold orthotics medial ( lateral OA ) lateral ( medial OA ) wedge . Both treatment control group test initially 1 year later . The dependant variable include static alignment measure ( tibiofemoral mechanical axis angle ) , biomechanical variable ( frontal plane rearfoot knee angle moment ) functional score ( WOMAC functional assessment score VAS pain score walk stair negotiation ) . Statistics : A series two-way ANOVAs use test hypothesis aim 1 3 . This design include 2 level group ( medial OA lateral OA ) three level trial ( pretest , wedge initial , wedge 1 yr. ) . Another series two-way ANOVAs use test hypothesis aim 2 . This design include 2 level group ( control treatment ) two level trial ( pretest 1 yr posttest ) . Significance determine level p &lt; .05 .</detailed_description>
