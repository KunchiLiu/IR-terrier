	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Placement Radiofrequency-based Plasma Microdebridement Treatment Algorithm Foot Ankle Tendinosis Plantar Fasciosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several million Americans receive treatment heel pain year , two million patient treated year plantar fasciitis fasciosis alone . ( 2 ) Conservative treatment option recalcitrant heel pain include rest , stretch , strengthen massage , progress non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , cox-2 inhibitor , steroid injection iontophoresis continued recalcitrance . ( 3 ; 4 ) Orthotics , heel cup , night splint plantar strap conservative option frequently recommend treating physician . ( 4 ) Patient outcomes response conservative measure usually positive , non-responsive case , approximately 2 % - 10 % presenting case , receive surgical care . Extracorporeal shockwave treatment ( ESWT ) recently advocate recalcitrant case show effective 60-80 percent case . ( 5-7 ) In general , non-surgical treatment plantar fasciosis tendinosis believe unsuccessful , surgical treatment require 25 % patient ; however , result traditional surgical treatment report deteriorate time . ( 8 ) Clinical experience follow RF-based plasma microtenotomy demonstrate excellent success treat chronic , refractive tendinosis lateral epicondyle elbow . ( 9 ) The investigator report technique technically simple perform much less invasive conventional surgery . Patients rapid uncomplicated recovery report minimal pain 7-10 day follow procedure ; pain relief persist improved 24 month . Magnetic resonance imaging correlate well clinical result . The RF-based plasma microtenotomy procedure also use successfully tendon shoulder , knee , foot ankle plantar fascia . A randomize control study conduct aim determine whether bRF-based microtenotomy effective treat chronic supraspinatus tendinosis ( 10 ) . Longitudinal postoperative recovery one year patient treat use RF-based plasma microtenotomy compare patient undergo subacromial decompression . Both patient group demonstrate significant improvement respective procedure longitudinal recovery profile statistically similar . Early experience use procedure foot ankle tendon , include Achilles tendon , posterior tibial tendon , peroneal tendon , plantar fascia reveal 90 % good excellent result , reflect result show patient treat tendinosis elbow ( 11 ) Further investigation optimal placement surgical approach standard care treatment paradigm treat plantar fasciosis Achilles tendinosis would beneficial . It know whether RF-based plasma microsurgery might optimally place early within standard care treatment algorithm . The purpose study determine magnitude improvement pain functional symptom two year period enrollment registry study patient present chronic heel pain undergoing standard care treatment . Standard care include traditional conservative care measure , ESWT , radiofrequency-based plasma microdebridement , scalpel debridement and/or surgical release .</detailed_description>
