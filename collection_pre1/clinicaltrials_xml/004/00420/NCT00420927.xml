	<brief_title>Study Optimal Protocol Methotrexate Adalimumab Combination Therapy Early Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 78-week , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , double-treatment period study design compare safety efficacy adalimumab MTX placebo MTX subject early RA . Subjects randomize receive adalimumab 40 mg every week ( eow ) placebo subcutaneous injection combination orally administer MTX 26 week ( Period 1 ) . All subject arm receive open-label MTX weekly throughout study ( Period 1 Period 2 ) . At Weeks 22 26 , subject assess achievement low disease activity , define DAS28 score 3.2 . DAS28 measure RA disease activity calculate use number tender swollen joint ( total 28 ) , C-reactive protein level ( CRP , blood marker inflammation ) , patient 's global assessment disease activity ( indicated mark 10 cm line good bad ) . Subjects achieve low disease activity Week 22 26 adalimumab arm end Period 1 randomize receive MTX monotherapy ( placebo MTX ) combination therapy ( adalimumab MTX ) 1:1 ratio duration Period 2 ( 52 week , i.e. , Week 78 study ) . Subjects achieve low disease activity Week 22 26 placebo arm ( MTX monotherapy ) end Period 1 continue receive MTX monotherapy ( placebo injection blind fashion ) duration Period 2 . Subjects fail achieve low disease activity Week 22 26 end Period 1 receive open-label combination therapy Period 2 regardless treatment assignment Period 1 .</detailed_description>
