	<brief_title>Effects Atomoxetine Cognitive Function Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia occur approximately 1 % general population . Hallmark symptoms schizophrenia include positive negative symptom , well deficits various aspect cognitive function , particular reference neuropsychological task related prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) . A lead theory respect deficit prefrontal cortical functioning dysregulation ( overall hypofunction ) mesocortical dopamine ( DA ) projection VTA prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) person schizophrenia , thus diminish ability task mediate cortical area [ 1 ] . Further , think high rate smoke schizophrenia ( 58-88 % ) compare non-psychiatric population ( ~25 % ) may due part tendency schizophrenic patient remediate neurocognitive deficit cigarette smoking , nicotine show improve select cognitive deficit person illness [ 2-4 ] , fact cognitive deficit may vulnerability factor predispose patient initiate maintain smoke [ 5 ] . Atomoxetine ( Strattera™ ) efficacy treat child adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . It increase extracellular level NE DA PFC block NE transporter ( NET ) , show DA predominately take non-selectively NET [ 6 ] . In contrast , atomoxetine find increase extracellular DA subcortical area [ 6 ] . It theorize atomoxetine may selectively increase DA PFC ( versus subcortical area ) inhibition NETs PFC . Accordingly , since person schizophrenia think deficit DA PFC , excessive subcortical DA function , NET inhibitor atomoxetine may increase DA-dependent PFC-mediated neurocognitive functioning , reduce negative symptom associate disorder , without worsen positive symptom schizophrenia . Atomoxetine show safe effective ADHD treatment child adult ( Eiland , 2004 ) . Little known Atomoxetine 's effect treat psychiatric disorder , however , hypothesize medication may efficacy cognitive remediation schizophrenic population ( Friedman , 2004 ) . In order fully understand effect medication , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial propose sixty ( 60 ) participant schizophrenia cigarette smoker would randomize double-blind manner one three dos atomoxetine [ 0.0 mg/day ( n=20 ) , 40.0 mg/day ( n=20 ) , 80.0 mg/day ( n=20 ) ] . Doses chosen accordance FDA suggest dosing , include schedule initiation start 40.0mg/day target recommend dose 80.0mg/day may reach within three day period . The high recommend dose 100 mg/day . These dos ultimately select study dose believe well-tolerated patient , dos may achieve within two-week period study , two dos fit intention study dose-dependent effect medication . Safety effectiveness dos determine patient 18 year age old ADD , population study use Atomoxetine . Should discover patient schizophrenia tolerate dos well extensive monitoring physiological clinical symptom , maximum dose 80.0 mg/day reach time period , small dos consider appropriate amendment submit . Participants would assess across three cognitive test session two-week period include baseline assessment Day 1 ( prior medication administration ) , Day 8 ( one week medication ) , Day 15 ( two week medication ) . No data currently exist literature regard specific improvement neurocognitive performance schizophrenia atomoxetine , although hypothesize medication may specifically helpful schizophrenia . Therefore believe one first study kind . We hypothesize atomoxetine dose-dependently improve deficit PFC-related cognitive performance person schizophrenia . We secondarily hypothesize schizophrenic smoker demonstrate reduction negative symptom daily cigarette consumption atomoxetine compare placebo .</detailed_description>
