	<detailed_description>This study compare plain x-ray ( XR ) , skeletal scintigraphy ( SS ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography/CT ( PET/CT ) measure response . MRI PET/CT perform need standard care . We anticipate MRI perform commonly due back pain . Researchers also compare three set standardize evaluation criterion ( UICC criterion , WHO criteria , MDACC criterion ) . The MDACC criterion new UICC WHO standard criterion . The old criterion longer think reliable base old technology ( XR SS ) . Since new technology include old criterion , cancer doctor use old criterion evaluation bone lesion . Therefore , new bone tumor criterion include new image technique ( CT MRI ) need . At end study , researcher look sensitive clear imaging technique , use set criterion learn technique best measure disease 's response therapy . Participants study complete physical exam , include score bone pain . Routine blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) perform participation study begin . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test start treatment . Participants also image examination ( XR , SS , CT , MRI , PET/CT ) . All first examination finish within one month start anti-cancer therapy . If imaging examination alone prove disease spread bone , needle bone biopsy do . A bone biopsy mean researcher collect couple small tumor sample suspicious bone site . The tumor sample take use large needle appropriate anesthesia . If find eligible study , image exam ( describe ) , bone score evaluation , blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) do treatment 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month start anticancer therapy . Plain radiograph : Also call X-rays . You receive complete bone survey . This consist 2 view spine , one view top head , one view chest , one view pelvic bone , two rib , one side . Any symptomatic bone scan also include . Skeletal scintigraphy : Also call bone scan . You eat 4 hour examination . You get picture 2-3 hour intravenous injection Technetium-99m bound methylene diphosphonate ( Tc-99m MDP ) . CT : CT scan include chest , abdomen , pelvis . You eat 6 hour examination . You give oral intravenous contrast do standard care . MRI : This optional procedure . MRI symptomatic area perform follow schedule imaging . You give contrast dye vein do standard care . PET/CT : This optional procedure . The examination usually take 30-40 min lie move bed tunnel 60-90min injection 2-deoxy-2- [ 18F ] fluoro-D-glucose ( FDG ) vein . You eat 6 hour examination . Your part study end 12 month test . However , monitor 3 year enrol study . This investigational study . This study focus test treatment agent test image technique assess bone tumor response . The exam perform study commercially available part routine examination . A total 120 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
