	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Topical Phenylephrine Gel Management Faecal Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Faecal seepage even frank incontinence night problem approximately 30 % patient undergone ileal pouch anal anastomosis ( IPAA ) . Nocturnal seepage may problem patient gross incontinence , may even incontinence day . Although baseline continence day maintain involuntary control internal anal sphincter , supplement voluntary contraction external sphincter . While sleep , supplementary external sphincter effect lose internal anal sphincter tone reduce , leading seepage . This obviously distress lead patient wear pad reduce soil may occur . The primary objective determine effect 10 % phenylephrine hydrochloride gel , apply three time day , change baseline end study ( 8 week ) faecal incontinence score ( St Mark 's ) passive faecal incontinence ileo-anal pouch construction , compare placebo .</detailed_description>
