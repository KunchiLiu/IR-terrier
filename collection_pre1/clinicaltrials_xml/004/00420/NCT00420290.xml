	<brief_summary>Chronic hemodialysis ( CHD ) patient display multiple metabolic abnormality relate advanced uremia . Despite vigorous attempt prevent abnormality consequence , CHD patient suffer unique form nutritional derangement , term `` uremic wasting '' . Several study demonstrate presence uremic wasting , especially degree loss muscle mass , sharply increase mortality hospitalization rate CHD patient . Several factor think associate uremic wasting , include hormonal derangement , anorexia , physical inactivity , concurrent illness . Chronic inflammation , also highly prevalent patient , cause muscle catabolism animal model certain clinical condition . Epidemiological study show association chronic inflammation uremic wasting hemodialysis patient indicate possible causal relationship . The cause activate inflammatory state CHD patient believe multi-factorial . Nevertheless , certainly important host limit biological activity elicit strong anti-inflammatory response , example production naturally occur receptor antagonist . Interleukin 1 beta , one major pro-inflammatory cytokine show associated protein catabolism several chronic disease state , include advanced uremia . A balance interleukin 1 beta ( agonist ) naturally occur receptor antagonist IL-1ra may play pivotal role control inflammatory response consequence population . The overall goal particular grant application examine short-term effect administration recombinant form IL-1ra 1 ) chronic inflammatory state 2 ) protein homeostasis chronically inflamed CHD patient . We update protocol perform interim analysis . The interim analysis perform half plan study sample enrol ( 14 subject ; 7 arm ) . The interim analysis approve Data Safety Monitoring Board .</brief_summary>
