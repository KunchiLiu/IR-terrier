	<brief_summary>This study examine whether whole-body vibration slow bone loss healthy postmenopausal woman osteopenia . Whole-body vibration promise novel therapy involve stand platform produce extremely small fast up-and-down movement . Some research study find whole-body vibration slow bone loss postmenopausal woman . One reason different study find different result may use various speed vibration . This study look different speed whole-body vibration influence bone mineral density differently postmenopausal woman osteopenia . Two hundred postmenopausal woman take part 12-month study . Women randomly assign three group ( 67 woman per group ) group compare . Group 1 receive fast whole-body vibration , Group 2 receive fast whole-body vibration , Group 3 receive whole-body vibration . We look various bone mineral density bone quality measurement , obtain three different type technology , begin study 12 month follow-up . The hypothesis study comparison Group 3 ( vibration ) , Groups 1 2 experience reduce bone loss 12 month , great reduction bone loss experience Group 1 . The result study help u determine whether whole-body vibration different speed produce variable effect bone , hence explain inconsistency result obtain previous study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence Vibration Bone Mineral Density Women Who Have Weak Bones After Menopause</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent animal study show whole-body vibration increase bone mineral density . The effect whole-body vibration bone examine six small human study inconsistent result . Two study show whole-body vibration reduces bone loss menopause . Studies use high speed whole-body vibration may produce great reduction bone loss . OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS : The objective study examine effect two whole-body vibration speed trabecular BMD low leg osteopenic postmenopausal woman . Two hundred postmenopausal woman take part 12-month study . Women randomly assign three group ( 67 woman per group ) group compare . Group 1 receive fast ( 90 Hz ) whole-body vibration , Group 2 receive fast ( 30 Hz ) whole-body vibration , Group 3 receive whole-body vibration . The hypothesis study comparison Group 3 ( vibration ) , Groups 1 ( fast vibration , 90 Hz ) 2 ( fast vibration , 30 Hz ) experience reduce bone loss 12 month , great reduction bone loss experience Group 1 . METHODOLOGY : Women clinical condition affect bone receiving drug affect bone exclude . The whole-body vibration therapy involve stand barefoot upright vibration platform daily 20 minute . Data collect baseline , 12 month follow-up . Our primary analysis evaluate whether difference change trabecular BMD low leg ( measure peripheral quantitative compute tomography ; pQCT ) Groups 1 , 2 , 3 . Our secondary analysis examine whether difference change follow bone characteristic Groups 1 , 2 , 3 : 1. trabecular bone quality low leg ( measure pQCT ) 2. cortical bone BMD quality low leg ( measure pQCT ) 3. trabecular cortical bone BMD quality wrist ( measure pQCT ) 4 . BMD hip spine ( measure dual x-ray absorptiometry , DXA ) 5 . BMD quality heel ( measure quantitative ultrasound ) . SIGNIFICANCE : Based current scientific understand bone remodeling , vibration device potential play significant part maintain bone health postmenopausal woman . The result study help u determine whether low-magnitude , high-frequency WBV different vibration rate produce variable effect bone , hence explain inconsistency result obtain previously . This study also lay ground work future large-scale randomize control trial need investigate long-term effect WBV prevent postmenopausal bone loss . If effective , WBV another non-pharmaceutical strategy decrease bone loss postmenopausal woman . This turn decrease number osteoporotic fracture associate morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
