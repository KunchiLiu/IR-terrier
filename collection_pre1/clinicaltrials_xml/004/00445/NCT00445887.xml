	<brief_title>Levonorgestrel Preventing Ovarian Cancer Patients High Risk Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine impact levonorgestrel relative frequency apoptosis ovarian epithelium patient high risk ovarian cancer . Secondary - Estimate impact drug proliferation transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) expression ovarian epithelium patient . - Assess safety drug patient . OUTLINE : This prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study . Patients stratify accord menopausal status ( premenopausal v postmenopausal ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral levonorgestrel daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . In arm , treatment continue 4-6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , include day surgery . Patients undergo prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy* . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 year . NOTE : * Patients unable surgery complete expect 4-6 week , may continue levonorgestrel placebo time period &gt; 5 month . Patients unable undergo surgery within 5 month remove study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
