	<brief_summary>Background : Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) aggressive subtypes non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Flavopiridol investigational drug work differently standard chemotherapy may target abnormality MCL DLBCL cell , protein excess prevents tumor cell die . A challenge develop flavopiridol treatment determine optimal dosing schedule . The schedule use study effective type leukemia call chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) may benefit patient MCL DLBCL also . Objectives : To determine high dose flavopiridol give safely patient relapse MCL DLBCL dose schedule detail To assess response tumor flavopiridol give test dose schedule Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old relapse MCL DLBCL Design : Flavopiridol give four different dose level , start low dose first group three six patient increase subsequent group , depend side effect precede dose . The drug give weekly 4 week follow 2-week break ( one cycle ) six cycle . It give vein 30-minute infusion follow 4-hour infusion . Patients undergo follow procedure research study evaluate effect treatment tumor : - Blood test - Lymph node , bone marrow tumor biopsy - Lymphapheresis collect blood cell research - Disease stag image study ( compute tomography ( CT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) every 2 cycle</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treat Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Flavopiridol synthetic N-methylpiperidinyl , chlorophenyl flavone compound target number different cellular pathway process . It work several different mechanism include inhibition cyclin dependent kinase cyclin D-1 complex over-expressed mantle cell lymphoma . Flavopiridol also demonstrate activity activate B-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line . One great challenge develop flavopiridol apply clinically determine optimal dosing schedule . Following several different dose schedule , one strategy promise chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) application so-called hybrid schedule drug ( infusion intermediate time follow bolus dose ) . Objectives : Assess toxicity safety administration hybrid schedule . Assess response rate hybrid schedule flavopiridol relapse mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . Eligibility : Relapsed MCL DLBCL . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( P.S . ) less equal 2 . Age great equal 18 year . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) serology negative Design : Phase I/II . Phase I portion consist 3-4 dose level 3-6 patient . Administer weekly time 4 2 week ( 1 cycle ) . Restage every 2 cycle . Continue complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) 6 cycle . Dose reduction toxicity address protocol . Phase II portion study Simon optimal two-stage design : design rule 20 % response rate ( p0=0.20 ) favor 45 % response rate ( p1=0.45 ) . The maximum sample size accrue study 71 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Previously treat mantle cell lymphoma diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( include mediastinal ( thymic ) large Bcell lymphoma ; transform large Bcell lymphoma ; follicular grade IIIB large Bcell lymphoma ; intravascular large Bcell lymphoma ) . Confirmed pathological diagnosis National Cancer Institute , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . Recurrent measurable disease ( measurable disease 2 dimension leukemic disease quantify follow ) . Prior anthracyclinebased treatment patient diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . Age great 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance 2 better . Major organ function : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 1000/mcL , Platelet great 50,000/mcL , Creatinine le 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance great 60 mL/min ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less 5 x upper limit normal ; bilirubin le 2 mg/dL ( total ) except less 5 mg/dL patient Gilbert 's syndrome define great 80 % unconjugated . ANC platelet requirement must meet independent transfusion . Informed consent willingness use contraception men woman . Both male female patient must willing use adequate contraception ( include effective barrier method contraception ) completely abstain heterosexual intercourse protocol treatment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant nursing unknown potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) serology negative . HIV positive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction flavopiridol . Additionally , biology HIV associate DLBCL 's often quite different HIV negative disease due involvement Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) . Hepatitis B surface antigen negative . Active central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma . These patient poor prognosis frequently develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse event . History inflammatory bowel disease unless inactive period 2 year . Recovery toxicity prior therapy grade 1 less . Systemic cytotoxic experimental treatment within 4 week treatment . White blood cell ( WBC ) great 100,000 cells/mcL .</criteria>
