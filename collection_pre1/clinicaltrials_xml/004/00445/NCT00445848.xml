	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab also may stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving erlotinib together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give erlotinib together bevacizumab work treat patient stage IIIB stage IV primary non-small cell lung cancer never smoke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0636 : Erlotinib Bevacizumab Never-Smokers With Stage IIIB Stage IV Primary Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess overall survival patient stage IIIB IV primary non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma never smoke treated erlotinib hydrochloride bevacizumab . Secondary - Assess progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) subset patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-21 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
