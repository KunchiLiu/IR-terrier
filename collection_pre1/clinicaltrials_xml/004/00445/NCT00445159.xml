	<brief_summary>This study evaluate UT-15C sustained release tablet subject experience ischemic low limb rest pain relate advanced peripheral arterial disease . Rest pain one primary management issue severe arterial occlusive disease may lead amputation pain become intolerable unresponsive narcotic analgesia . Rest pain also impact quality sleep mobility frequent interruption sleep decreased mobility . Treprostinil sodium ( Remodulin® ) study several small open-label study show safe well effective agent ischemic rest pain give subcutaneous intravenous delivery . However , form administration patient convenience limitation , include need infusion device associate pain site infusion subcutaneous delivery . UT-15C may allow patient suffer CLI benefit simplicity oral dosage form</brief_summary>
