	<brief_summary>Fish aquaculture sector constitute increase part fish consumption Denmark . The important farm fish Denmark rainbow trout . Due limit access wild fish feed production , alternative feeding regime vegetable origin vegetable protein rapeseed oil use instead marine feed . This change feed regime may affect flesh quality health nutritional property content long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 LCPUFA ) presumably decrease meat . The objective study investigate effect vegetable base feed versus marine feed farm trout effect healthy men cardiovascular risk marker associate development cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Trout Fed With Vegetable Based Feed Cardiovascular Risk Markers Plasma Proteome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In two month parallel study include 60 healthy men age 40-70 year , cardiovascular effect one daily meal trout feed vegetable base feed compare trout fed marine feed ( estimate intake n-3 LCPUFA 2.6 g/day ) standard Danish diet poultry . Men randomise one three group . Red blood cell fatty acid composition , classical cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) -risk marker ( blood pressure plasma lipid profile ) , new CVD-markers ( arterial compliance plasma marker endothelial function inflammation ) plasma proteome analysis measure begin end intervention period .</detailed_description>
