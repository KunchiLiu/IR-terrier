	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Stereotactic radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Giving stereotactic radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose stereotactic radiation therapy treat patient kidney tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose radiation patient undergoing stereotactic radiotherapy renal tumor . - Determine radiotherapy-associated toxicity patient . Secondary - Determine preoperative pathologic response regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study radiotherapy . - Radiotherapy : Patients undergo stereotactic radiotherapy 1 tumor . Cohorts 4-8 patient receive escalate dos radiotherapy twice daily 2 day maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) upper limit reach . The MTD define dose precede least 2 4 3 8 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . DLT assess 4 8 week radiotherapy . - Surgery : Two month completion radiotherapy , patient undergo preoperative assessment tumor response follow partial nephrectomy . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically least 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
