	<brief_summary>HYPTHOTHESIS : The researcher hypothesize application active magnetic therapy vs. sham utilized individual sleep reduce neuropathic pain spine improve quality sleep . The null hypothesis treatment subject spine pain exposure permanent/static magnetic field measurable effect neuropathic pain score quality sleep score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Magnetic Field Therapy Improve Quality Sleep Reduction Chronic Spine Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN : This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study consist two treatment group . Treated subject receive permanent/static magnetic sleeping pad nominal strength less 1000 Gauss . Control subject receive physically identical sleep pad nominal surface field strength 0 Gauss ( placebo ) . The magnet contain standard mattress pad subject sleep pad . The primary outcome measure quality sleep well daily VAS score . These subjective . There objective assessment quantification autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) strengths parasympathetic sympathetic effect non-invasive digital study use spectral analysis . Individuals evaluate onset study end study look specific range motion , spasm , radiculitis , etc . Scores keep monthly basis well repeat ANS test month . At end study , individual return form , reevaluate Dr. Weintraub also ask question regard PGIC bias , etc . Additionally heart rate systolic diastolic BP reading rest challenge stand record baseline visit determine anti-hypertensive effect sleep magnetic device . A reduction 3 mm Hg improve stroke cardiac risk minimum 4 % . No new anti-hypertensive medication allow .</detailed_description>
