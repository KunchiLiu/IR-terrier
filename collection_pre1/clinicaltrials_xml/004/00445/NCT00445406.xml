	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab also may stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give bevacizumab together doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome work treat woman locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome Treating Women With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety tolerability bevacizumab doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome woman locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer . Secondary - Determine efficacy regimen patient . - Identify surrogate marker angiogenesis , include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF receptor 1 , matrix metalloproteinase 9 , patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 courses* . Patients receive bevacizumab alone IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Courses bevacizumab repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients may receive additional course doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome discretion primary investigator . Blood sample collect baseline , day 1 course 3 every 3 month study treatment , completion study treatment . Samples analyze enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay determine level circulate angiogenesis-related molecule , include serum vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF receptor 1 , matrix metalloproteinase 9 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 43 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
