	<brief_summary>Some patient undergo cardiovascular surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass develop kidney injury follow surgery . The purpose study take blood sample patient type surgery nine time point surgery test plasma biomarker call NGAL compare NGAL level creatinine level . We hypothesize NGAL early marker kidney injury creatinine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) Early Evolving Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 350 adult schedule undergo cardiac surgery involve use cardiopulmonary bypass enrol . Blood sample obtain patient study future measurement plasma NGAL plasma creatinine level sample nine time point . Blood sample later assessment use Triage NGAL Test process plasma clinical site , frozen ship Biosite storage . Testing Triage NGAL Test conduct Biosite train laboratory personnel . The result assessment blind medical team study impact medical management patient . The medical team care study patient obtain clinical laboratory test per usual post-operative routine manage patient accordingly . Any serum creatinine measurement obtain site part routine care pre-operatively Day 10 post-operatively record well additional post-operative renal insult , development oliguria , need nephrology consultation , initiation dialysis mortality also record Day 10 .</detailed_description>
