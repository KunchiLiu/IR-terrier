	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . Giving lenalidomide together vaccine therapy may make strong immune response kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give lenalidomide together vaccine therapy work treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether lenalidomide augment efficacy pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine correlate lenalidomide-induced antitumor efficacy patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Secondary - Determine antibody responses pneumococcal serotypes patient treat regimen . - Determine T-cell response carrier protein CRM 197 patient treated regimen . - Determine ability lenalidomide augment vivo immune responsiveness measure cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reaction Candida tetanus patient . - Determine ability lenalidomide prime and/or boost systemic vaccine responses peripheral blood lymphocyte marrow lymphocytes patient . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . - Group 1 : Patients receive oral lenalidomide day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) 14 day prior begin lenalidomide approximately 2 month ( first dose vaccine ) . - Group 2 : Patients receive lenalidomide group 1 . Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine IM approximately 45 day begin lenalidomide approximately 2 month ( first dose vaccine ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
