	<brief_summary>Patellofemoral pain syndrome ( PFPS ) common knee disorder affect physically active people . Despite grow base support early introduction hip strengthen exercise rehabilitation PFPS , randomize clinical trial compare isolated hip isolated quadriceps strengthen . The purpose study determine different exercise affect pain , strength , muscle activity , function female subject patellofemoral pain . The researcher hypothesize female diagnose PFPS initially participate hip strengthen program report great perceive level function , great strength , less pain , improve neuromuscular activity participate progressive quadriceps strengthen intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : Thirty-three female PFPS perform either initial hip strengthening ( hip group ) initial quadriceps strengthen ( quad group ) 4 week , prior 4 week similar program functional weight-bearing exercise . Self-reported pain , function , functional strength measure . Isometric strength assess hip abductor , external rotators , knee extensor . A mixed-model analysis variance use determine group difference time .</detailed_description>
