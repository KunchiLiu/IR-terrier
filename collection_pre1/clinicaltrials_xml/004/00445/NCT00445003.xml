	<brief_summary>The purpose study find treatment intravitreal injection triamcinolone intravitreal injection ranibizumab prevent loss vision cause panretinal photocoagulation treatment . At present time , know whether intravitreal steroid anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) injection beneficial prevent vision loss panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) treatment . It possible one type injection prevent vision loss PRP treatment . However , know whether benefit injection outweigh risk . It possible side effect , injection may good laser alone treat diabetic retinopathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser-Ranibizumab-Triamcinolone Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) manifest retinal neovascularization disc ( NVD ) elsewhere ( NVE ) . Vitreous hemorrhage tractional detachment PDR lead cause severe visual loss new onset blindness . Without intervention , 60 percent individual diabetic retinopathy eventually develop PDR , result significant visual loss nearly fifty percent . Proliferative diabetic retinopathy currently treat panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) destroy area retina preserve central vision . PRP effectively see regression new vessel , stabilization neovascularization , reduce risk visual loss . However , treatment associate unavoidable side effect include macular edema transient permanent central vision loss , diminished vision loss , night vision loss . The treatment apply laser burn peripheral retinal tissue , destroy outer photoreceptors retinal pigment epithelium retina , think exert effect increase oxygen delivery inner retina decrease viable hypoxic cell produce growth factor VEGF . Studies implicate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) substance lead neovascularization and/or increase vascular permeability . Thus , reasonable expect inhibition VEGF could reduce PDR transient vision loss macular edema . There several anti-VEGF drug . Ranibizumab drug evaluate trial . In one trial ranibizumab DME , ten patient chronic DME receive series 0.5 mg intraocular injection . The treatment well tolerate ocular systemic adverse event . Since intraocular injection ranibizumab significantly reduce foveal thickness improve visual acuity ten patient , strong rationale consider drug adjunctive therapy PRP attempt reduce acute , transient edema may occur PRP . Similarly , corticosteroid , class substance anti-inflammatory property , demonstrate inhibit expression VEGF . Triamcinolone acetonide often used periocular injection treatment cystoid macular edema ( CME ) secondary uveitis . Clinically , triamcinolone acetonide use treatment proliferative vitreoretinopathy choroidal neovascularization . Studies patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy randomly assign receive 4 mg triamcinolone 10 15 day prior PRP treatment show reduction central macular thickening , fluorescein leakage great injection group control group 9 12 month follow . Mean visual acuity improve one line injection group worsen two line control group . In summary , strong rationale use either intravitreal ranibizumab intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide adjunct PRP could reduce magnitude vision loss . This study conduct determine whether intravitreal injection anti-VEGF drug intravitreal injection corticosteroid reduce occurrence macular edema visual acuity impairment follow PRP . Subjects randomly assign equal probability one follow three injection group : - Intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab ( Lucentisâ„¢ ) baseline 4 week - Intravitreal injection 4 mg triamcinolone acetonide baseline sham injection 4 week - Sham injection baseline 4 week The initial injection ( sham ) give day randomization . Focal ( macular ) photocoagulation give 7 10 day follow injection . Panretinal ( scatter ) photocoagulation initiate either day focal photocoagulation ( immediately follow focal photocoagulation ) subsequent day must initiate within 14 day baseline injection . Required follow-up visit occur 4 , 14 , 34 56 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria Age &gt; = 18 year Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Fellow eye ( study eye ) meet criterion . Able willing provide inform consent . Study Eye Inclusion Criteria Subjects may one two study eye . Subjects two study eye randomly assign receive sham injection baseline 4 week one eye either ranibizumab triamcinolone eye . Presence severe nonproliferative proliferative diabetic retinopathy investigator intend complete panretinal photocoagulation within 49 day randomization . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) present clinical exam central subfield thickness Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) &gt; 250 micron , within 8 day randomization . Best correct ElectronicEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity letter score &gt; =24 ( i.e. , 20/320 good ) , within 8 day randomization . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , subject cooperation sufficient administer panretinal photocoagulation obtain adequate fundus photograph OCT . If prior macular photocoagulation perform , investigator believe study eye may possibly benefit additional focal photocoagulation . General Exclusion Criteria Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . Known allergy component study drug . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 diastolic 110 ) . Major surgery within 28 day prior randomization major surgery plan next 6 month . Myocardial infarction , cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment acute congestive heart failure within 4 month prior randomization . Systemic antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior randomization . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 12 month . Subject expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center 12 month study . Study Eye Exclusion Criteria , Study eye : Prior panretinal photocoagulation sufficiently extensive investigator believe least 1200 additional burn need possible within 49 day randomization . Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , prevent visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition ) . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , retinal vein artery occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc. ) . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . History treatment DME time past 4 month ( focal/grid macular photocoagulation , intravitreal peribulbar corticosteroid , antiVEGF drug , treatment ) . History major ocular surgery ( include vitrectomy , cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 4 month anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization . History Yttrium Aluminum Garnet capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization . Aphakia . Intraocular pressure &gt; = 25 mmHg . History openangle glaucoma ( either primary openangle glaucoma cause openangle glaucoma ; note : angleclosure glaucoma exclusion criterion ) . History steroidinduced intraocular pressure elevation require intraocular pressurelowering treatment . History prior herpetic ocular infection . Exam evidence ocular toxoplasmosis . Exam evidence pseudoexfoliation . Exam evidence external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion , significant blepharitis . Fellow Eye Criteria Intraocular pressure &lt; 25 mmHg .
