	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give erlotinib together sorafenib work treat patient progressive recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Erlotinib sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving erlotinib together sorafenib may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Sorafenib Treating Patients With Progressive Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective trial estimate overall survival rate associate combine regimen treat adult patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess estimate toxicity . II . Tumor response rate . III . To estimate 6-month progression free survival . IV . To describe pharmacokinetics route administration . V. For Molecular Targeted Combinations Correlative ( MTC2 ) Study Initiative : To determine relationship tumor blood biomarkers clinical outcome patient treat combination target agent . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , phase II study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue blood sample collect prior beginning treatment . Samples analyze immunohistochemistry , gene expression , DNA mutation genomic analysis epidermal growth factor receptor , ras-raf-ERK , PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways identify marker correlate patient outcome . Blood sample also collect day 15 course 1 pharmacokinetic study . Samples analyze reversed-phase isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry determine concentration erlotinib hydrochloride sorafenib tosylate know metabolite . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
