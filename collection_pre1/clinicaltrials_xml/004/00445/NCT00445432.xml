	<brief_title>A Study Adalimumab Maintenance Clinical Remission Japanese Subjects With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2/3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind ( DB ) , placebo-controlled , two-arm , efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetic study design demonstrate effectiveness adalimumab Japanese patient moderate severe Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . All participant complete Study M04-729 ( NCT00445939 ) , lead-in adalimumab induction therapy study , eligible study . Participants roll study receive either DB treatment ( adalimumab placebo ) open-label ( OL ) treatment adalimumab . Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) use determine participant responder participant clinical remission . CDAI document number soft stool , abdominal pain , general well-being , presence 6 sign ( arthritis/arthralgia ; iritis/uveitis ; erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum/aphthous stomatitis ; fissure , abscess , anal fistula ; cutaneous fistula ; fever 100 degree ) , take medication diarrhea , abdominal mass , hematocrit , weight loss 1-week assessment period . It yield total score &gt; = 0 without upper limit . Baseline score study range 221 448 . Low score=less severe CD activity . Decrease score indicate improvement . Clinical remission CDAI score &lt; 150 . Clinical response-70 ( CR-70 ) = decrease CDAI ≥ 70 point lead-in study Baseline score . Clinical response-100 ( CR-100 ) = decrease CDAI ≥ 100 point lead-in study Baseline score . Participants CR-70 response Week 4 induction study randomize 1 2 treatment group ( double-blind adalimumab 40 mg every week adalimumab placebo every week ) use 2 stratification factor - CDAI category ( CDAI le 150 CDAI 150 high ) presence/absence fistula Week 0 study . The double-blind treatment last Week 0 Week 52 . Any time Week 4 study , participant 's disease flare ( defined recurrence active disease , specifically increase CDAI compare Week 0 study ≥ 70 point CDAI 220 ) double-blind treatment period , participant allow move OL treatment . At Week 52 , participant still receive DB treatment move open-label treatment could continue study adalimumab approve commercial use Japan . Participants respond Week 4 induction study participant disease flare DB treatment study enter OL treatment receive adalimumab 40 mg every week . At Week 4 study , participant open-label treatment group disease flare participant still respond treatment , participant allow dose escalate adalimumab 80 mg every week . Participants enter open-label treatment allow continue open-label adalimumab adalimumab approve commercial use Japan . The study complete . Results study report endpoint Week 52 ( end DB treatment period ) subject receive DB treatment ( adalimumab placebo ) OL adalimumab treatment endpoint Week 148 subject receive least one dose adalimumab study .</detailed_description>
