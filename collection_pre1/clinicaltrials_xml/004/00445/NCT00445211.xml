	<brief_summary>Patients intra-aortic balloon pump ( catheter place groin connect pump assist heart open closing balloon aorta , thereby decrease work heart improve blood flow coronary artery ) often receive intravenous ( IV ) heparin ( `` blood thinner '' ) prevent circulation problem leg ( insert ) . When intra-aortic balloon pump initially develop , catheter large catheter use today . Due large size catheter material use make catheter , think intravenous heparin would prevent poor blood flow leg contain temporary catheter . Intravenous heparin , however , never proven maintain good blood flow patient . The catheter use intra-aortic balloon pump small size make material less likely produce blood clot . It clear heparin need intra-aortic balloon pump . Bleeding complication associate intra-aortic balloon pump may decrease heparin use . In 2004 , 99 patient receive intra-aortic balloon pump cardiac catheterization lab William Beaumont Hospital . These patient receive intravenous heparin experience large number bleeding complication ( 27 patient require blood transfusion ) . This study help investigator clarify heparin routinely use patient intra-aortic balloon pump .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential patient identify cardiac catheterization lab intra-aortic balloon pump place . Patients agree participate study randomize ( select receive heparin receive heparin intra-aortic balloon pump ) process similar flipping coin . Patients 50 % chance receive heparin 50 % chance receive heparin . If patient want participate study , his/her cardiologist decide patient receive receive heparin . Intra-aortic balloon pump use without intravenous heparin know increase complication patient receive heparin . Risks include bleed possible blood clots/decreased blood flow leg catheter group ( due different medical reason ) . The patient group monitor closely cardiac care unit intra-aortic balloon pump place prevent and/or minimize complication .</detailed_description>
