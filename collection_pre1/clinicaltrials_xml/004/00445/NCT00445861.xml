	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving cetuximab , docetaxel , cisplatin together radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect cetuximab , docetaxel , cisplatin , radiation therapy see well work treat patient locally advanced esophageal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab , Docetaxel , Cisplatin , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety neoadjuvant radiotherapy combination cetuximab , docetaxel , cisplatin patient resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer . Secondary - Determine feasibility efficacy regimen patient . - Determine duration response pattern failure patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Chemoimmunotherapy : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour weekly week 1-3 docetaxel IV 1 hour cisplatin IV 1 hour week 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course . - Chemoimmunotherapy radiotherapy : Patients sequentially assign 1 2 treatment level . - Treatment level 1 : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1 hour weekly , cisplatin IV 1 hour weekly , undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , week 7-11 . - Treatment level 2 : Patients receive cetuximab , cisplatin , radiotherapy treatment level 1 . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 1-2 hour weekly week 7-11 . Cohorts 7-20 patient treat treatment level 1 2 sequentially , long 2 7 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , safe treatment level future study determine . The safe treatment level define level 2 7 6 20 patient experience DLT . At least 20 patient treated safe treatment level . - Surgery : Between 4-8 week completion neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy radiotherapy , patient undergo surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 27 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
