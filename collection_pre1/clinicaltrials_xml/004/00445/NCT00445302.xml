	<detailed_description>This phase I , open label , multi-center study eighteen subject renal impairment six healthy control subject normal renal function receive single dose plerixafor ( 240 µg/kg ) administer subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . Eligible male female subject renal impairment ( age 18-78 year ) healthy control subject ( age upper age range renal impairment subject ) enrol study . Subjects renal impairment enrol stratify three cohort use Screening 24 hour urine collection measure creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) value ( estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ) : Mild Impairment ( CLcr = 51-80 ml/min ) , Moderate Impairment ( CLcr = 31-50 ml/min ) , Severe Impairment ( CLcr &lt; 31 ml/min , require dialysis ) . Control subject normal renal function ( CLcr &gt; 90 ml/min ) , determine Screening 24 hour urine collection . The screen visit occur within 14 day prior plerixafor administration study day one . Subjects monitor 10 hour follow administration study drug . In addition , subject return clinic 24 48 hour plerixafor administration blood sample safety assessment . This study previously post AnorMED , Inc . In November 2006 , AnorMED , Inc. acquire Genzyme Corporation . Genzyme Corporation sponsor trial .</detailed_description>
