	<brief_summary>Background : - Vandetanib drug attack group proteins surface many cell , especially blood vessel cell tumor cell . - Tumors require development new blood vessel order grow spread . - In laboratory experiment , vandetanib slow growth certain tumor regulate blood vessel growth . - In early clinical trial , patient ' tumor grow period time receive vandetanib . Objectives : - To determine whether vandetanib cause tumor shrink stabilize patient ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal cancer . - To determine , tumor biopsy , feature tumor change vandetanib treatment may predict tumor likely respond vandetanib . Eligibility : - Women 18 year age old ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Patients take vandetanib daily , mouth 28-day cycle disease worsen develop unacceptable side effect . - Tumor biopsy ( surgical removal sample tumor tissue ) do start vandetanib treatment 6 week treatment . - Patients follow clinic every 4 week treatment physical examination , blood test , review laboratory study side effect . - Patients compute tomography ( CT ) scan every 8 week monitor tumor growth magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) start vandetanib treatment , third day take vandetanib 6 week treatment . - Patients quality life assess regularly schedule questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Epithelial ovarian cancer require neovascularization growth metastasis . Anti-angiogenesis agent show promise treatment recurrent disease . Expression vascular endothelial growth factor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) demonstrate ovarian cancer specimens stroma tumor . Blocking autocrine paracrine loop act receptor may inhibit downstream phosphorylation target mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) AKT pathway , thereby influence disease progression patient outcome . - The multi-kinase inhibitor ZD6474 ( vandetanib , AstraZeneca , Zactima ) block angiogenesis target VEGFR2 , show vitro activity number receptor tyrosine kinase include resonance energy transfer ( RET ) , vascular endothelial growth factor 3 ( VEGFR3 ) EGFR . - Clinical efficacy ZD6474 ( vandetanib ) woman refractory relapse epithelial ovarian cancer unknown , preclinical data suggest potential value . - The maximum tolerate dose ZD6474 ( vandetanib ) determine 300mg/day , limit dose-responsive adverse effect prolong ( Q wave , T wave ) QT interval . Objectives : - To assess clinical activity ( CR - complete response , PR - partial response , disease stabilization ) VEGFR2 inhibitor ZD6474 ( vandetanib ) , 300mg/d , woman ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . - To study target signal event : quantity activation VEGFR2 , EGFR , AKT extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) . Eligibility : - Women biopsy-proven epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer relapse and/or refractory prior therapy . - Women must measurable disease NCI Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion sentinel lesion adequate core biopsy percutaneous biopsy . - Women must four prior treatment regimen . Design : - Women receive 300mg ZD6474 ( vandetanib ) daily , orally 28-day cycle disease progression , excessive toxicity , withdrawal study . - Biopsy tumor perform prior start ZD6474 ( vandetanib ) six week treatment . The quantity phosphorylated VEGFR2 , EGFR , ERK AKT biopsy tissue analyze . - Clinical outcome toxicity measure correlate target inhibition . - Women also undergo serial image dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI estimate tumor blood flow . - Research blood sample take assess change circulate cytokine concentration . - Quality life assess treatment .</detailed_description>
