	<brief_summary>This study determine whether rest beta cell ( cell pancreas produce insulin ) 2 week improve ability patient Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) make insulin . Beta cell rest give patient insulin shot . The study also examine teenager T2DM feel diabetes explore difference young people without T2DM . This study include patient 12 25 year age T2DM overweight diagnose within 2 year enrol study . Healthy individual normal weight overweight also eligible . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination laboratory test . Participants T2DM assign one two group . Group 1 take anti-diabetes medicine call metformin follow diet prescribed study staff dietitian 2 week . Group 2 take metformin , follow prescribe diet , receive insulin pump skin 2 week . During two week , participant follow test : - Frequent blood sugar check . - Oral glucose tolerance test ( routine diabetes test blood sample draw several time subject drink sugary solution ) . - Arginine stimulation test response body arginine , normal ingredient food stimulates release insulin . Two catheter place vein arm , one administer liquid contain arginine , draw blood sample . - Ultrasound blood vessel neck check harden artery . - Metabolism test measure amount oxygen use rest . The subject breathes normally rest wear canopy head 20 minute . - MRI scan abdomen examine amount fat belly ( begin end study ) - DEXA scan determine percent body fat . - Tests explore quality life feeling health , work school , friend family . - Exercise testing treadmill stationary bicycle . - Genetic study information diabetes obesity . Normal volunteer blood draw , oral glucose tolerance testing , MRI scan , DEXA scan , psychological testing , exercise testing , genetic testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Short-Term Beta-Cell Rest Adolescents Young Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) condition characterize insulin resistance progressive failure insulin-secreting beta-cells . Previously consider disease adult , become increasingly prevalent child adolescent . Patients childhood onset T2DM high risk diabetes-related morbidity mortality , due long life-time duration diabetes , well possible increase rapidity Beta-cell failure . Aims : In study , address follow aim : 1 . To characterize hormonal , metabolic , behavioral trait patient youth-onset type 2 diabetes . These include : 1 . Assessment Beta-cell function insulin resistance 2 . Psychological , demographic , socioeconomic assessment 3 . Assessment physiology pathophysiology incretins gut hormone 4 . Identification early biomarkers diabetes complication , especially cardiovascular disease 5 . Validation new method study glucose metabolism 2 . To serve recruitment development tool hypothesis-driven pilot study , discuss appendix protocol . Methods : Children young adult age 8 25 year type 2 diabetes study cross-sectional longitudinal manner . Two control group without diabetes study comparison purpose : healthy lean control , overweight/obese control . Methods use study participant include routine blood sampling , oral glucose tolerance testing , mixed meal testing , arginine stimulation testing , DEXA , MRI , carotid ultrasound , questionnaire , exercise physiology , measurement energy expenditure . Patients type 1 diabetes study use oral glucose tolerance mixed meal test pilot study artificial sweetener .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DIABETIC SUBJECTS : INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Type 2 diabetes mellitus define : 1 . Fasting blood glucose great equal 126 mg/dL OR postprandial blood sugar great equal 200 mg/dL ( either OGTT NIH previously document outside medical record ) . 2 . Since subject may already start treatment hypoglycemic agent time enrollment , may blood glucose level impair glucose tolerance range ( fast glucose 100125 mg/dL postprandial 140199 mg/dL ) . This sign adequately control diabetes , rather incorrect diagnosis diabetes . Therefore , prior documentation ( outside medical record ) blood glucose value document diabetes acceptable subject impair glucose tolerance rather overt diabetes accord screen result NIH . 3 . Absence insulin autoantibody ( insulin na ( SqrRoot ) patient ) Or 2 . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes mellitus ( Pilot Study ) And 3 . Age 825 year enrollment EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Normal OGTT NIH ( fast blood glucose &lt; 100 mg/dL AND 2 hour blood glucose &lt; 140 mg/dL ) 2 . Significant comorbidity , opinion investigator , increase risk subject ( specific obesityrelated comorbidities explicitly permit , include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obstructive sleep apnea nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ) 3 . Positive urine pregnancy test 4 . Psychiatric cognitive disorder , opinion investigator , limit subject 's ability comply study procedure NONDIABETIC CONTROLS : INCLUSION CRITERIA : Two type volunteer recruit : 1 . Overweight obese volunteer BMI match study enrollee T2DM analyse 2 . Normal weight ( BMI 5th 85th centile age ) volunteer EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Diabetes 2 . Significant comorbidity , opinion investigator , increase risk subject ( specific obesityrelated comorbidities explicitly permit , include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obstructive sleep apnea nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ) 3 . Current use drug alter glucose metabolism ( e.g . metformin ) 4 . Current use prescription nonprescription weightloss drug 5 . Positive urine pregnancy test 6 . Psychiatric cognitive disorder , opinion investigator , limit subject 's ability comply study procedure</criteria>
