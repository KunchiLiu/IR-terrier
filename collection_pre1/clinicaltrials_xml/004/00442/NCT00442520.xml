	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomic Study Patients Lung , Colorectal Head/Neck Cancers Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study establish pilot pharmacogenomic program identifying genetic variation predict safety , toxicity and/or efficacy drug . DNA extract patient ' peripheral blood study SNPs DPD , TS , MTHFR , UGT1A1 , CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , GSTM1 , GSTT1 , GSTP1 , HO-1 , ERCC1 , XPD , XRCC1 EGFR gene . The result genetic study compare treatment efficacy toxicity . The ultimate goal use genotype profile provide individualized cancer treatment improve outcome decrease toxicity .</detailed_description>
