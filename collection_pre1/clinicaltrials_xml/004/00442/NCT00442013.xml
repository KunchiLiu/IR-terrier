	<brief_title>Lansoprazole Treat Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 75 % individual asthma also experience GERD . If leave untreated , GERD lead lung damage , esophageal ulcer , esophageal cancer . Children adult whose asthma poorly control inhaled corticosteroid often prescribe drug suppress gastric acid production ; however , treatment expensive proven beneficial . Lansoprazole proton pump inhibitor medication reduce stomach acid production . It may also decrease frequency asthma exacerbation child poorly control asthma . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness lansoprazole improve asthma control , quality life , lung function child asthma . This study enroll child poor asthma control receive inhaled corticosteroid . Participants randomly assign receive either lansoprazole placebo daily basis 6 month . Study visit occur baseline Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , participant contact telephone Week 2 . A physical examination , blood collection , methacholine challenge test occur select visit . The methacholine challenge test use help determine severity individual 's asthma . Lung function airway pressure testing , questionnaires asthma control quality life , medical history review , pill count , distribution medication occur study visit . Participants record asthma symptom lung function daily diary throughout study . A select group participant also wear esophageal potential Hydrogen ( pH ) monitor 24 hour evaluate GERD symptom relationship GERD asthma symptom .</detailed_description>
