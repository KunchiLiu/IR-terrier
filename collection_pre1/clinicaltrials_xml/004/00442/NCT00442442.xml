	<detailed_description>Mosquito coil extremely widely use household across world reportedly make large single family expenditure health-related item many develop Countries . Despite widespread use robust clinical evaluation determine whether provide protection malaria . This study design determine use coil ( / LLIN ) even reduce malaria household level . The study single-blind , randomise clinical evaluation cluster household level . There 4 treatment arm , Coils / Insecticide treat net / Coils + ITN / No treatment . Each arm include 400 household 5 people / household ( total 8000 people ) . A maximum 20 % house village enrol reduce effect diversion mosquito treatment . Epidemiological factor baseline malaria prevalence record pre-intervention baseline month questionnaire rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) use species-specific dip stick malaria . Post intervention 5 monthly visit malaria season detect new case RDT , report fever operational data ( compliance , adverse effect etc ) . Primary outcome clinical measure incidence malaria ( P. falciparum / P. vivax ) compare new case 3 treatment &amp; non-treatment group . All case treat promptly accord local policy . At end study , household treat bed net provide one . Secondary non-clinical outcome measure include entomological data collect house use / non use coil sentinel village baseline &amp; study . CDC mosquito light trap use record number / species / feed status / parity ( age ) / sporozoite infection rate mosquitoes house use / not-using coil follow randomise latin square design . Such entomological data use determine reduction vector specie mosquitoes enter house use coil / ITN . Ethical approval study grant LSHTM University London Ethics Committee Yunnan Bureau Health , P.R.China .</detailed_description>
