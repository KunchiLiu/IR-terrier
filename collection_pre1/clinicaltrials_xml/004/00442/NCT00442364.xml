	<brief_title>Safety Study Varisolve® Procedure Treatment Varicose Veins Patients With Right-to-left Cardiac Shunt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varicose vein extremely common , affect 25 % western adult population . While early stage little sometimes-painful aesthetic problem , progression inevitable progress severe largely irreversible problem chronic venous insufficiency ( CVI ) , finally , venous leg ulcer . At present , system proven identify progress varicose vein cause CVI , approximately 50 % patient leg ulcer , superficial varicose vein causal factor identify . The cost management simple varicose vein relatively small comparison long-term management CVI leg ulcer . Many patient progress develop leg ulcer without received primary treatment varicose vein . The current management major varicose vein include maintenance compression stocking , injection sclerotherapy liquid sclerosants , superficial vein surgery . The disadvantage surgery include use general anesthesia , incision result possible scar , painful recovery period significant functional time historically high rate recurrence . Sclerotherapy perform since 1851 advent hypodermic needle . The two surfactant sclerosants widely use sodium tetradecyl sulphate ( STS , STD® , Sotradecol Fibro-vein ) polidocanol ( Macrogol 400 Ph Eur , Aethoxyskerol® ) . Sotradecol FDA-approved sclerosant . With advent duplex ultrasound scan , technique echo-guided sclerotherapy widen possibility sclerotherapy large vein liquid sclerosants available rapidly deactivate diluted blood frequently result unsatisfactory outcome . Because microfoam delivers sclerosant efficiently venous endothelium , believe low concentration polidocanol ( Varisolve ) use compare liquid sclerosant . BTG International Ltd develop sclerosant microfoam technology base polidocanol ( PD ) ( Varisolve ) pharmaceutical product . The presence bubble heart concern bubble may pass right heart leave patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) right-to-left shunt . Once systemic circulation , bubble inevitably pass cerebral circulation theoretical potential causing damage due occlusion vessel recognize yet ill define . Therefore study determine whether patient bubble detect middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) Varisolve® procedure experience sub-clinical , safety-related event abnormality brain MRI , neurological examination , cardiac marker symptom sign .</detailed_description>
