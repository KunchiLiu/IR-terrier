	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Abatacept Patients With Diffuse Systemic Sclerosis ( Scleroderma )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis autoimmune connective tissue disease unknown etiology characterize progressive fibrosis skin internal organ , vascular damage , autoantibody production . Although disease relatively rare , associate considerable morbidity mortality . There improvement survival past decade ; however , relate well management vascular manifestation disease include renal crisis , pulmonary hypertension , gastroesophageal reflux disease , Raynaud 's phenomenon . Clinical study disease modify therapy cutaneous disease date relatively unsuccessful . Although etiology disease remain unknown , several observation support role activate T cell blood skin affect patient . Abatacept , recombinant fusion protein block T cell activation , recently approve FDA rheumatoid arthritis . We hypothesize inhibition T cell activation abatacept may efficacious treatment patient diffuse systemic sclerosis . This randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial abatacept versus placebo patient diffuse systemic sclerosis . Changes validate measure skin thickness disease activity 6-months treatment compare patient receive abatacept receive placebo . Patients randomize 2:1 receive abatacept .</detailed_description>
