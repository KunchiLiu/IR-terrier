	<brief_summary>The study objective determine course change OCT measure macular thickness visual acuity follow single session focal photocoagulation center-involved DME . The response evaluate separately eye without prior focal photocoagulation DME . The purpose determine proportion eye continue improve least 5 letter visual acuity least 10 % central retinal thickness session focal photocoagulation . In addition , study explore whether baseline factor identify predictive response . All subject follow-up visit 8 week 16 week post treatment . At 16-week visit , study eye evaluate change retinal thickness visual acuity baseline . - Treatment defer follow continue visual acuity letter score improve &gt; 5 OCT central subfield thickness decrease &gt; 10 % compare baseline . - If visual acuity letter score improve least 5 OCT central subfield thickness decrease least 10 % , eye classify 'not improve ' investigator may provide additional treatment . Follow end eye receive additional treatment visit . However , investigator participant elect defer additional treatment ( even deferral criterion meet ) , follow continue study eye receive additional treatment DME . - Eyes continue follow visit every 8 week ( +1week ) long continued improvement visual acuity ( letter score improve &gt; 5 ) retinal thickness ( central subfield thickness decrease &gt; 10 % ) compare visit 16 week earlier . The long follow-up time 48 week . By provide information length time clinically meaningful improvement occur follow focal photocoagulation , clinician well able determine photocoagulation treatment consider persistent DME . Depending result study , future randomize clinical trial consider compare aggressive retreatment photocoagulation regimen currently serve standard DRCR Network approach focal photocoagulation macular edema less aggressive regimen evaluate protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Focal photocoagulation treatment demonstrate beneficial diabetic macular edema . In ETDRS , focal photocoagulation eye macular edema reduce risk moderate visual loss ( decrease 15 letter ) approximately 50 % ( 24 % 12 % , three year initiation treatment ) . For eyes center-involved DME visual acuity bad 20/40 treated focal photocoagulation , 15-letter improvement rate 1 year 11 % 3 year 16 % . In ETDRS , focal photocoagulation treatment diabetic macular edema involve direct treatment discrete lesion 500 micron 3000 micron center macula think cause retinal thicken hard exudate without `` grid '' treatment macular area retinal thicken non-perfusion . The lesion treat directly include microaneurysms , identify fluorescein angiography , either fill leak , intraretinal microvascular abnormality ( IRMA ) , pruned capillary leak fluorescein . Grid treatment apply ETDRS area thicken retina show diffuse fluorescein leakage area non-perfusion identified capillary dropout fluorescein angiography . Areas non-perfusion macula could treat grid discretion treat ophthalmologist . Areas discrete lesion diffuse leakage capillary dropout would receive combination direct grid treatment . Re-treatment applied four month interval clinically significant macular edema persist , one treatable lesion identify , investigator believe lesion responsible edema . The median number focal laser treatment apply ETDRS 3.8 . The mechanism action focal photocoagulation fully understand ; however , clear retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) absorb majority laser energy thermal injury occur level RPE . Studies show photocoagulation eventually result retinal apparent RPE atrophy 200-300 % large original laser spot size . These area expand atrophy lead loss central vision , central scotoma , decrease color vision . Consequently , many retinal specialist today tend treat lighter , less intense laser burn originally specify ETDRS . In addition concern regard spread intense laser burn , number reason retinal specialist today modify treatment procedure originally specify ETDRS protocol . These reason include advent new laser clinical observation different technique , focal photocoagulation lighter burn grid treatment alone , may similar beneficial effect original ETDRS treatment protocol . A modified ETDRS focal photocoagulation protocol adapt original ETDRS approach , adopt standard laser technique DME use DRCRnet study . There limited data course visual acuity central retinal thickness single focal photocoagulation session DME . In prior DRCRnet DME treatment protocol include laser arm , accord re-treatment protocol eye receive second focal photocoagulation session 3.5- 4 month ( first follow-up visit ) unless substantial improvement define least 50 % decrease retinal thicken central subfield measurement OCT. As result , unknown proportion eye lesser degree improvement would continue improve time course improvement follow initial photocoagulation session give additional time . In one study conduct DRCRnet eye previously treat DME , among 113 eye modify ETDRS laser treatment group baseline OCT central subfield &gt; 250 micron , 50 % reduction OCT central subfield thicken present 3.5 month 28 ( 25 % ) . The table categorize 85 eye meet measure improvement 3.5 month regard improvement visual acuity least 5 letter and/or reduction central subfield thickness least 10 % . The 5 letter reduction select base 95 % confidence interval change determine study evaluate validity reliability electronic ETDRS visual acuity test procedure use DRCRnet protocol . The 10 % threshold select base DRCRnet OCT reproducibility study find 10 % change central subfield thickness likely real . Forty-seven ( 42 % ) eye meet protocol requirement repeat photocoagulation first follow-up visit improvement either visual acuity ( least 5 letter ) , central subfield ( least 10 % reduction ) , follow-up visit . Other DRCRnet protocol provide data course follow single photocoagulation session 4 month follow . In pilot study design evaluate peribulbar corticosteroid mild DME ( OCT central subfield thickness = 250 micron visual acuity 20/40 good baseline ) , modify ETDRS focal photocoagulation treatment give control group . Follow-up visit occur 1 , 2 , 4 month eye eligible retreat . Twenty-one 37 eye laser group previously treat focal photocoagulation DME 17 eye previously treat focal photocoagulation . A 50 % reduction OCT central subfield thicken occur 11 ( 30 % ) 37 eye 17 week . Fourteen ( 38 % ) eye would meet criterion re-treatment improvement either visual acuity ( least 5 letter ) , central subfield ( least 10 % ) , 17 week . In another pilot study evaluate intravitreal bevacizumab DME ( OCT central subfield thickness = 275 micron visual acuity 20/32 bad baseline ) , modify ETDRS focal photocoagulation treatment give control group . Follow-up visit occur 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 week eye eligible retreat . There 7 eye laser group previously treat focal photocoagulation DME 12 eye previously treat focal photocoagulation . Among 19 eye , 50 % reduction OCT central subfield thicken occur 3 ( 16 % ) 12 week . Ten ( 53 % ) eye would meet criterion re-treatment improvement either visual acuity ( least 5 letter ) , central subfield ( least 10 % ) , 12 week . The data three protocol indicate substantial number eye receive focal photocoagulation ( either initial course repeat application ) show improvement central retinal thickness 3-4 month least 10 % le 50 % baseline thickening . It eye knowledge course retinal thicken visual acuity without additional intervention need ass whether present requirement re-treatment aggressive need .</detailed_description>

Subject expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center next 6 month . The following exclusion apply study eye ( i.e. , may present nonstudy eye ) : Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , significant macular ischemia , nonretinal condition ) . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc. ) . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) .
