	<brief_summary>Morbidity Mortality among Dialysis Patients Treating Depression Objectives Our investigation two objective : 1 . To assess whether treatment recovery depression decrease adverse clinical event chronic hemodialysis patient . Significant morbidity associate depression dialysis patient , subsequent impact outcome treatment depression report . 2 . To examine rate recovery depression 6-month 12-month period among prevalent dialysis patient . Rates recovery among dialysis patient depression unclear . The natural history depression among dialysis patient may help long-term management . Plan Methods This project longitudinal prospective cohort study comprise dialysis patient outpatient dialysis unit Portland , Oregon metropolitan area . Patients must age 18 old start dialysis least 90 day prior enrollment . Patients exclude delirious , demented , speak English , prior psychiatric diagnosis depression . Baseline data collection include patient demographic , etiology renal disease , nutritional status , past medical psychiatric history baseline health status . Social support quality life assessment obtain direct interview . All patient assess depression Beck Depression Index , depression scale particularly useful chronic illness , Diagnostic Interview Scale , gold standard depression assessment . Those depressed undergo pharmacologic treatment SSRI , agree , reassess 2 6 month improvement . Patients respond refer psychiatric therapy . The primary outcome study combine rate prespecified morbidity mortality 18 month two group : depressed subject agree treatment depressed subject agree treatment . Prespecified morbidities include rate 1 ) cardiovascular cerebrovascular event , 2 ) infection , 3 ) vascular access complication , 4 ) death . These select base prior study suggest depression increase cardiovascular cerebrovascular event , suppresses immune system , up-regulates coagulation factor platelet aggregation . , , , , , , Chi-square test T-tests use compare baseline variable among depressed . A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model compare survival among group , adjustment baseline variable . Calculations derive Neyman-Pearson equation determine sample size 120 subject . Findings date We enrol 134 subject date , include 47 PVAMC , 87 outside dialysis unit . Twenty-percent depressed . ( We need enroll 120 depressed patient . ) No result obtain year . No characteristic analyze date . All adverse event report , none unexpected . Significance We hope demonstrate reduction adverse clinical outcome treatment depression . If , would advocate depression modifiable risk factor warrant therapy well-being dialysis patient .</brief_summary>
