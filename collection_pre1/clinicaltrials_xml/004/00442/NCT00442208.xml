	<brief_summary>Primary : To compare pharmacodynamic efficacy PN 200 control intragastric pH ( percent time pH &gt; 4.0 ) follow twice daily administration different dose time relative food ( 30 60 minute prior food take togeterh food ) Day 5 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label , Randomized , Comparative 3-Way Cross-Over Study Evaluate Effect Food 24-Hour Intragastric pH Day 5 After Twice Daily Oral Administration PN 200 ( Omeprazole/Naproxen ) Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate effect different dose time PN 200 relative food intragastric pH profile PN 200 . PN 200 contains immediate release omeprazole , may subject acid degradation stomach . Food known buffering effect acid therefore may result less degradation immediate release omeprazole . Alternatively , food may decrease absorption omeprazole duodenum . The relative magnitude effect unknown . The data study aid choose optimal timing PN dose relative food future study . The study blind primary endpoint ( intragastric pH ) physiological variable believe readily influence conscious subconscious subject control .</detailed_description>
