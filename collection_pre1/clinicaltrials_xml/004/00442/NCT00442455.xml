	<detailed_description>Phase I : 3 cohort 3-6 patient , patient receive : - Erlotinib 100-150 mg/day po 7 week . - Cisplatin 30-40 mg/m2 iv weekly 7 week . - Radiation therapy 63 Gy , five day week , 7 week . Cohort 1 : 3 patient include cohort 1 . If DLT record first three patient 7-weeks treatment , dose level erlotinib escalate 150 mg enrollment cohort 2 initiate . If DLT record one first three patient 7-weeks treatment , first cohort expand 6 patient . - If DLT record patient 4 6 cohort 1 7-weeks treatment cycle , dose level erlotinib escalate 150 mg enrollment cohort 2 initiate , patient 6 complete 7-weeks treatment . - If DLT record one patient 4 6 cohort 1 7-weeks treatment cycle , dose level erlotinib escalate 150 mg enrollment cohort 2 initiate , patient 6 complete 7-weeks treatment . - If DLT record 2 patient patient 4 6 cohort 1 , 7-weeks treatment , trial terminate dose level consider Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) . If DLT record 2 patient first three patient 7-weeks treatment , trial terminate dose level consider Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) . Cohort 2 : If DLT record one first three patient 1-2 6 patient cohort 1 , 3 patient include cohort 2 . If DLT record first three patient 7-weeks treatment , dose level cisplatin escalate 40 mg/m2 enrollment cohort 3 initiate . If DLT record one first three patient 7-weeks treatment , second cohort expand 6 patient . - If DLT record patient 4 6 cohort 2 7-weeks treatment cycle , dose level cisplatin escalate 40 mg/m2 enrollment cohort 3 initiate , patient 6 complete 7-weeks treatment - If DLT record one patient 4 6 cohort 2 7-weeks treatment cycle , dose level cisplatin escalate 40 mg/m2 enrollment cohort 3 initiate , patient 6 complete 7-weeks treatment - If DLT record 2 patient patient 4 6 cohort 2 7-weeks treatment , trial terminate dose level consider Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) . If DLT record 2 patient first three patient cohort 2 7-weeks treatment , trial terminate dose level consider Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) . Cohort 3 : If DLT record one first three patient 1-2 6 patient cohort 2 , 3 patient include cohort 2 . If DLT record first three patient 7-weeks treatment , Maximum Tolerated Dose reach . If DLT record one first three patient 7-weeks treatment , third cohort expand 6 patient . - If DLT record patient 4 6 cohort 3 7-weeks treatment cycle , Maximum Tolerated Dose reach . - If DLT record one patient 4 6 cohort 3 7-weeks treatment cycle , Maximum Tolerated Dose reach . - If DLT record 2 patient patient 4 6 cohort 3 7-weeks treatment , trial terminate dose level consider Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) . If DLT record 2 patient first three patient cohort 3 7-weeks treatment , trial terminate dose level consider Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) . Inclusion third patient cohort allow safety data two previous patient analyzed Inclusion third patient cohort allow safety data two previous patient analyze DLT define : - Any clinically intolerable hematological non-hematological grade 3-4 toxicity . - Grade 3-4 diarrhoea . - Grade 3-4 clinically intolerable grade 2 skin rash . - Grade 4 mucositis imply temporary interruption radiation therapy ( long 2 consecutive week ) . - Grade 4 mucositis occur within first 3 week treatment . - Grade 3-4 mucositis accompany one follow toxicity : - Worsening performance status , define ECOG ≥ 2 decrease 40 % Karnofsky performance status scale . - Grade 3 Weight loss ( correspond weight loss ≥ 20 % respect baseline weight ) . - Underlying pain ( include swallow ) VAS &gt; 7 . - Parenteral nutrition . - Any clinically significant toxicity , involve treatment interruption period longer two week . Maximum Tolerated Dose define dose level 2 patient first three patient one cohort ≥ 3 6 patient one cohort exhibit one DLT , 7-weeks treatment . Phase II : 75 patient treat dose step MTD determinate : - Progression Free Survival , define period time surgery disease progression death . - Overall survival . - Locoregional progression-free survival . A tumor assessment perform 30 day end treatment every 3 month disease progression afterwards .</detailed_description>
