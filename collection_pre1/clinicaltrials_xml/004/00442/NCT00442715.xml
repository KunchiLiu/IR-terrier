	<brief_summary>Vigorous exercise know cause transient bronchoconstriction school child asthma , many initially normal lung function rest . The presence extent phenomena early childhood difficult recognize , exercise induce bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) may limit child 's performance child may fail notice symptom take part organize competitive sport . Conversely , child participate vigorous activity day long , severe EIB may provoke crucial disable condition child . In school child exercise challenge test ( ECT ) well standardized test use make diagnosis asthma able discriminate asthma chronic breathing illness childhood also use determine effectiveness optimal dosage medication prescribe prevent EIB . The test include control run motor-driven treadmill follow schedule multiple spirometry maneuver . This procedure never test may suitable preschool age . In study assume free-run test combine measurement duplicate spirometry-sets would convenient way test young child . The aim study ) examine feasibility free-run protocol ( accord ATS/ERS recomendations ) , follow duplicate spirometry measurement early childhood . b ) explore existence exercise induce bronchoconstriction young child ( age 3-6 year old ) respiratory symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method : The child come comfortable clothes run shoe , consume light meal pulmonary medication withdraw describe . A parent , pediatric pulmonary physician technician present throughout test . Each child undergoes physical examination exclude evidence wheeze , baseline spirometry perform . The child ask run freely back forth ( without nose-clip ) 50m long corridor next pulmonary laboratory . The target achieve 6 minute `` free run '' increase hart-rate 80 % maximum least 4 minute accord ATS/ERS recommendation exercise challenge test old child [ 1 ] . An adult ( parent/technician/ physician ) run child encourage him/her continue run . Heart-rate O2-saturation monitor continuously throughout run use portable mobile pulse-oximeter monitor ( Nonin medical , INC , model 2500 , Minneapolis , USA ) . Spirometry measure accord recommendation preschool child [ 2 ] , commercial ZAN100 Spirometer situate pediatric pulmonary laboratory , skilled technician . Measurements perform stand position , without nose-clip ( comfort child ) two consecutive technically acceptable curve achieve . After free-run , spiroetmry measure duplicate set 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 20 minute post-exercise [ 1 ] . The good two curve select representative value interval , difference two value FEV1 &lt; 5 % . The following sign monitor pulmonologist : wheeze prolong expiration auscultation trachea two zone lung ( upper front lower back ) . Cough , shortness breath , perceive breathlessness within 20 minute run note . Analysis : Technically acceptable spirometry maneuver analyze . Baseline value first compare spirometry value relation height derive index 109 healthy child previous study [ 3 ] . Following exercise , best spirometry value interval compare baseline value . Exercise response define great decrease FEV1 express percentage baseline value . A bronchoconstriction response exercise consider positive FEV1 decrease baseline great 13 % [ 4 ] . Student â€™ pair t-test used comparison data spirometry index calculate value healthy child . A value p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . References : 1 .
