	<brief_summary>The purpose research study assess safety immune activity vaccine make participant 's cancer cell , administer reduced intensity transplant . In recent year , researcher Dana-Farber Cancer Institute discover vaccine make patient 's cancer cell , engineer laboratory produce protein call GM-CSF , effective stimulating powerful immune response specific cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Stem Cell Transplantation Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Followed Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This study divide four phase : 1 ) Screening ; 2 ) Reduced intensity transplant phase ; 3 ) Vaccinations ( cycle 1 cycle 2 : cycle last 7 week ) 4 ) Vaccine completion . - Screening Phase : After sign consent form , participant ask undergo screening test procedure find eligible participate study . These test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even patient take part research study . It important note insufficient number participant 's leukemia cell generate vaccine collect CLL collection banking study ( DF/HCC study 06-200 ) , eligible participate study . - Allogeneic reduce intensity stem cell transplant phase : The transplant phase study begin participant admit hospital receive chemotherapy stem cell transplant . The minimum duration hospitalization procedure approximately 8 day . Undergoing transplant involves follow procedure treatment : Central intravenous catheter ; chemotherapy ; medication prevent graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) ; medication prevent infection ; physical exam ; blood test bone marrow biopsy aspirate . - Vaccination Phase : Vaccinations give two cycle , seven week , identical exception administer . Cycle 1 vaccination begin approximately one month stem cell infuse , provide significant evidence GVHD . Cycle 2 vaccination approximately one month discontinue tacrolimus , provide evidence severe acute chronic GVHD . The vaccine give 6 time period two month . The participant receive vaccination shot weekly 3 vaccine every week 3 vaccine . - Skin biopsy do first fifth vaccination . Current status participant CLL assess determine disease respond transplant vaccination . These test include analysis bone marrow blood test . - Vaccine completion phase : After one cycle vaccination complete , participant return outpatient clinic monthly check-ups 6 visit , monitor effect vaccine . - Since trial involves use genetically modify cell , recommend participant trial undergo annual checkup least 20 year , order monitor long term effect vaccination treatment .</detailed_description>
