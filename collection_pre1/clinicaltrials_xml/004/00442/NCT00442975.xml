	<detailed_description>Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) important pathogen diseaseâˆ’causing virus , result disease unborn child well individual whose immune system work properly HIV receive treatment cancer , body 's ability fight infection good healthy people . HCMV infect majority population , yet rarely cause overt disease would limit capacity host transmit HCMV others . This virus think million year old think evolve time become efficient evade immune system . This mean become efficient move human population result human devote immunological resource control virus . Recent study report immune system work less efficiently old people , especially elderly patient CMV antibody compare age match control CMV antibody . It well recognize response vaccination generally low old population compare child , may think immunologically suboptimal position . It propose may result diversion key factor immune system address CMV infection , incidence increase age . This study allow assessment response license seasonal influenza vaccine respect age CMV status provide baseline information proof principle large study design .</detailed_description>
