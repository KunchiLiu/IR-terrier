	<brief_title>Erlotinib Avastin Patients With Cancer Esophagus Gastroesophageal Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We postulate addition bevacizumab may increase efficacy erlotinib patient metastatic esophageal cancer , without add significant toxicity . The non-overlapping toxicity profile may allow administration maximum tolerated dose agent without additive toxicity goal demonstrate synergistic clinical activity . This combination previously test two study malignancy good tolerance encouraging result .</detailed_description>
