	<brief_title>Effect Acute Psychological Stress Glucose Concentrations Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes often complain change blood glucose level time emotional mental stress , subject â€™ self-reporting high blood glucose measurement stressful condition . To daily distress diabetes additional emotional mental stress add momentum destabilize glucose level due adrenocortical response enhance insulin resistance decrease endogenous insulin secretion . Another physiological link stress diabetes might high sensitivity hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis , lead antagonize effect insulin action . A study type 2 diabetes demonstrate stressor destabilize blood glucose level . Stress level diabetes show relationship diabetic complication . Previous study psychological stress type 1 diabetes show effect elevate catecholamine level short-lived psychological stimulus glucose level , significantly delay decrease glucose concentration acute psychological stress postprandial state association elevate cortisol level , show change glucose concentration fast state . This contrast previous data healthy subject , show low glucose level psychological stress prevent stress-induced activation hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis , postprandial high blood glucose level induce large cortisol response . These finding different cortisol response fast feed status healthy absolute insulin deficient subject could also relevant glucose metabolism subject type 2 diabetes . The effect acute psychological stress glucose concentration may critically depend whether stress apply fast feed state . A different metabolic response stress depend food intake could explain different finding clinical trial contribute understand glucose response stress . The aim study thus test whether effect acute psychological stress glucose concentration different fast compare fed state type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
