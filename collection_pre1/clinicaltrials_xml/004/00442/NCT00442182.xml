	<detailed_description>Rationale : Autoinflammatory syndrome ( AIS ) group disorder characterize recurrent episode inflammation . This occur absence autoantibody antigen specific T cell . To date 6 genetically distinct hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome know recently sporadic syndrome , Schnitzler ’ syndrome ( urticaria , periodic fever paraproteinemia ) Periodic Fever Aphtous stomatitis , Pharyngitis Adenitis ( PFAPA ) recognize AIS . Amyloidosis serious complication chronic recurrent inflammation see syndromes . Although hereditary autoinflammatory disease genetic mutation know remain largely unclear mutation lead recurrent inflammatory attack . Symptomatic episode associate increased serum concentration pro-inflammatory mediator ( TNFα , IL-6 , IL1β IFN-g ) well anti-inflammatory compound ( IL-1ra , sTNFR p55 sTNFR p75 ) . In vitro ex vivo experiment suggest central role pathogenesis IL-1β . The observation rIL-1ra ( anakinra ) highly effective refractory TRAPS , CAPS , HIDS , refractory FMF SS support idea . Despite effectiveness daily painful subcutaneous injection injection site reaction remain problem . ITF2357 orally active histon deacetylase inhibitor potent anti-inflammatory effect due inhibition pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1β , TNFα , IFNg , IL-6 ) . We expect ITF2357 able modify clinical symptom AIS patient induce clinical complete remission reduction attack duration . Objective : The primary objective ass whether ITF2357 able induce clinical complete remission patient continuous symptom reduce attack duration &gt; 33 % periodically symptomatic patient . Secondary objective emergence adverse event toxicity well influence ITF2357 cytokine production laboratory parameter infection metabolism . Study design : Open Label Pilot Study Study population : AIS patient 18 year old severe disease Intervention : Patients continuous symptom receive 2-3 time day 50mg ( capsule ) ITF2357 total period 90 day . Patients periodic symptom take ITF2357 ( 2-3 time day 50mg ) 7-14 consecutive day 6-12 attack . Main study parameter : A clinical complete remission regard clinical score ( CS ) &lt; 10 scored symptom score list absence temperature &gt; 38.0°C normalisation CRP WBC level . The end attack define CS &lt; 20 absence temperature &gt; 38.0°C . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : All patient admit begin study 3 day period perform daily venipuncture , history physical examination twice ECG . They visit outpatient clinic four time physical examination , history , venipuncture ECG . Patients ask complete symptom score list note date , number ITF2357 capsule take present co-medication , symptom , temperature adverse event . Patients ask collect portion morning urine week . ITF2357 show follow adverse reaction asymptomatic trombocytopenia perhaps increase incidence mild infection mainly upper respiratory tract . There gastrointestinal complaint sense nausea , vomit , abdominal pain diarrhea .</detailed_description>
