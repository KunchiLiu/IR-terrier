Only long-term follow-up outcome data shed much-needed light answer question stump u several year . Data large observational cohort patient treat combination antiretroviral therapy provide insight long-term safety durability various antiretroviral therapeutic approach , efficacy HIV viral load CD4 cell count predictor disease progression mortality , importance adherence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To collect evaluate long-term clinical outcome HIV infect participant previously enrol HIV-NAT trial . Secondary Objective : To Assess : 1 . Long-term consequence initiation antiretroviral predict baseline CD4 cell count and/or baseline plasma HIV RNA level 2 . Incidence lipodystrophy metabolic complication three different group patient initially treat NRTI-based regimen , NNRTI-based regimen , PI-based regimen 3 . Class-specific incidence lipodystrophy metabolic complication d4T versus AZT , nevirapine versus efavirenz individual PIs ( IDV , SQV , Kaletra , atazanavir ) 4 . Resistance profile patient different antiretroviral regimen 5 . Long-term consequence antiretroviral agent cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , endocrine function , skin , gastrointestinal system urogentital tract 6 . Incidence opportunistic infection malignancy include hepatocarcinoma patient HIV/HCV HIV/HBV co-infection 7 . Immune recovery syndrome 8 . Adherence different antiretroviral regimen 9 .
