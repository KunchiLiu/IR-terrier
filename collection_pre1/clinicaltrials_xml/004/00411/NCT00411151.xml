	<brief_summary>This trial conduct evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability sunitinib ( sunitinib-malate ) second-line palliative therapy metastatic gastric cancer . Despite effort front-line therapy , second-line protocol yet establish randomized clinical trial patient . Although many patient still good performance status present low tumor burden failure first-line chemotherapy , may clearly benefit second-line treatment . Increasingly metachronic metastatic patient urge new platinum-free therapeutic option due fast-growing use ( neo- ) adjuvant platin-based protocol . So far , sparse data chemotherapy available failure platin-based protocol . Nearly irinotecan-containing combination properly analyze , produce excellent response rate survival time 30 % 7.6 month , respectively . However , irinotecan approve yet indication . In addition , irinotecan-containing regimen submit approval first-line therapy , second-line regimen irinotecan-refractory patient evaluate trial . Thus , urgent need establish new second-line treatment option , cisplatinum- irinotecan-combination refractory patient advance metastatic gastric cancer . Sunitinib inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) involve tumor proliferation angiogenesis , specifically VEGFR , PDGFR , KIT , FLT-3 , RET . The VEGF pathway show significant factor metastatic gastric cancer . In gastric carcinoma cell , VEGF ligands receptor definitely involved process tumor progression . KDR FLT-1 express widely VEGF stimulate KDR-positive tumor cell growth directly . The ligand VEGF-C also show involved progression human gastric carcinoma , particularly via lymphangiogenesis . In addition , peritoneal metastasis cancer gastric cancer largely dependent VEGF . Therefore , patient chemo-refractory metastatic gastric cancer might benefit VEGFR inhibitory therapy sunitinib .</brief_summary>
