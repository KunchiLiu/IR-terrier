	<brief_summary>The purpose repeat dose study develop recommend dose information initiation therapy OROS Hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) patient chronic cancer pain convert strong oral transdermal opioids . It also assist development recommend start dose patient titrated appropriate maintenance dose OROS hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) . The safety profile OROS Hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) also evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Repeated-Dose Evaluation Use Pain Relieving Drug Safety OROS Hydromorphone HCI Patients With Chronic Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign treatment chance ) , single-blind ( respect dose ) , open-label ( patient know study treatment , dose , receive ) repeat dose study evaluate patient chronic cancer pain conduct tandem ( together ) similar protocol patient chronic non-malignant pain . A total 463 patient enrol evaluated study . Patients receive chronic opioid therapy convert daily OROS hydromorphone ( slow release ) use oral morphine equivalent . Supplementary immediate-release ( IR ) hydromorphone provide breakthrough pain . The dose OROS hydromorphone ( slow release ) escalate every 2 day therapy 3 dos immediate-release ( IR ) hydromorphone require 24-hour period . Once patient could maintain stable dose OROS hydromorphone ( slow release ) 3 consecutive day , patient enter 2-week maintenance phase . Patients complete study eligible participation OROS hydromorphone ( slow release ) long-term extension study , Study DO-109 . The hypothesis 24-hour controlled-release form oral hydromorphone may provide consistent pain relief , convenient dosing , enhance compliance possibly decrease incidence side effect associate peak ( high ) trough ( low ) fluctuation plasma drug concentration typically see immediate-release dosage formulation . Patients receive OROS Hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) Visit 2,3 , 4 ( either 8,16,32 , and/or 64mg tablet ) take orally . OROS Hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) dose titrate every two day therapy necessary dose stabilization occur , follow two week Maintenance Therapy Phase .</detailed_description>
