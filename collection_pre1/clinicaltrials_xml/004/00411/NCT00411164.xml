	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Slow Release Hydromorphone HCL Treatment Patients With Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 3 , randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , placebo-controlled , double-blind , fixed-dose , parallel-group , multicenter study adult patient OA ( osteoarthritis ) unable consistently control treat pain nonopioid medication , receive opioid treatment pain . Eligible patient randomize equal ratio receive 1 3 treatment : OROS hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) 8mg , OROS hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) 16 mg , placebo ( drug ) . All patient could take acetaminophen ( less equal 2000 mg per day ) rescue medication osteoarthritic pain . Rescue medication permit washout period 6 hour assessment effectiveness . The study comprise follow period : analgesic ( pain reliever ) taper washout period ( less equal 2 week ) , Titration ( increase ) Phase ( less equal 16 day ) , Maintenance Phase ( 12 week ) , study drug taper period ( less equal 1 week ) . At end washout period , patient receive OROS hydromorphone HCI ( slow release ) 8 mg match placebo take daily . After 1 week , patient return study site receive new supply study drug . During second week titration ( increase ) , patient randomize OROS hydromorphone ( slow release ) 16 mg group dose increase 8 mg daily 16 mg daily OROS hydromorphone ( slow release ) . No dose adjustment allow . After complete Maintenance Phase upon early termination , study drug taper 1 week follow : one 8 mg tablet placebo daily first 2 day take every day appropriate taper study medication . Safety assessment physical examination , vital sign , labs adverse event report do baseline , termination throughout study . The primary measurement time-interval weight area curve ( AUC ) divide maximum AUC benefit possible individual . The AUC measure cumulative pain intensity difference baseline Titration Maintenance phase . At termination , patient assign baseline pain value remainder trial , baseline observation carry forward ( BOCF ) last available pain value remainder trial , last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) overall index score , physical function , joint stiffness subscales analyze use AUC ratio change baseline use imputation , baseline observation carry forward ( BOCF ) last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) imputation method . The medical outcome study ( MOS ) sleep scale also analyze per protocol . OROS hydromorphone ( slow release ) 8 mg 16 mg tablet placebo take orally daily 17 week</detailed_description>
