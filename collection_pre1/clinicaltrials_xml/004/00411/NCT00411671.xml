	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine 8 week progression-free survival rate ( i.e . disease control rate ) patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) fail least one prior chemotherapy regimen . Secondary Objective : The secondary objective study : - Determine overall response rate - Determine overall survival - Determine time disease progression - Assess safety/toxicity study treatment - Assess biomarker modulation tumor tissue serum sample treatment . - Assess plasma intra-tumor concentration study treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BAY 43-9006® ( Sorafenib ) experimental agent design stop growth cancer cell . In order enroll study , must also enrol Protocol 2005-0823 : A Biomarker-integrated study Chemorefractory patient advance Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer . Protocol 2005-0823 screening study group study call BATTLE program . Participants Protocol 2005-0823 assigned one treatment study . The result tumor analysis help study doctor determine assign particular treatment study . While study , take 2 tablet sorafenib morning , even . Sorafenib take 1 cup water empty stomach ( either 1 hour meal 2 hour meal ) . Sorafenib must swallow whole without chew . If feel nauseate take medication , anti-nausea medication use . If miss dose , skip take next schedule dose right time . Your medication store room temperature . Every 4 week ( 1 cycle ) complete medical history record physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature , breathe rate ) weight . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test . You performance status evaluation ( question ability perform everyday activity ) blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clotting function . Your study doctor also ask medication take smoke history . You ask record weekly blood pressure first 6 week study treatment . The study doctor research nurse review log clinic visit . Every 2 cycle , tumor evaluate chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate status disease . If take Coumadin® ( warfarin ) , blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clot function weekly first 6 week treatment every cycle . You may continue receive sorafenib long cancer respond study treatment . Your doctor may decide take study experience intolerable side effect medical condition get bad . If stop study treatment , allow enroll one remain 3 protocols BATTLE program . After stop take study treatment , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You also blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clotting function . You performance status evaluation , chest x-ray , CT MRI scan . Following evaluation , contact telephone every 3 month 3 year , see . You right leave study time . If choose stop participating study , contact study chair and/or research nurse . Your doctor may decide take study medical condition get bad and/or unable comply study requirement . This investigational study . Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) approve FDA treatment advance renal cell cancer ; however , 's use research study investigational . Up 62 patient take part multicenter study . Up 50 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
