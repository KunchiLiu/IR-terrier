At least 15 examined lymph node require ensure adequate TNM ( Tumor Nodes Metastases classification . Patients underwent curative D2 lymphadenectomy resection gastric cancer macroscopic microscopic evidence remain tumor , randomize either study arm within 6 week surgery . Pregnant lactating woman . Women childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test baseline . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchild bear potential . Sexually active male female ( childbearing potential ) unwilling practice contraception study . Any evidence metastatic disease ( include presence tumor cell ascites ) . Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiotherapy immunotherapy except corticosteroid , currently treat gastric cancer . Major surgery within 4 week prior study treatment start , lack complete recovery effect major surgery . History another malignancy within last five year except cure basal cell carcinoma skin cure carcinoma insitu uterine cervix . Clinically significant ( i.e . active ) cardiac disease e.g . symptomatic coronary artery disease , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) grade II great congestive heart failure serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication myocardial infarction within last 12 month . Lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract malabsorption syndrome likely influence absorption capecitabine , inability take oral medication . Known peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAEv3 grade 1 ( Common Terminology Adverse Events ) . Absence deep tendon reflex sole neurologic abnormality render patient ineligible . Organ allograft require immunosuppressive therapy . Serious uncontrolled intercurrent infection serious uncontrolled concomitant disease .
