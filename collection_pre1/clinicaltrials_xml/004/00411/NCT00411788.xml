	<brief_summary>Rapamune ( generic name : Sirolimus® ) drug approve Food Drug Administration ( government ) use patient receive kidney transplant prevent patient 's body rejecting transplant kidney . It show antitumor effect laboratory , approve time treatment cancer . Herceptin new form chemotherapy approve Food Drug Administration treatment breast cancer . This study design evaluate effect safety combine Rapamune Herceptin breast cancer . Rapamune Herceptin combine result laboratory study suggest combination two drug superior either drug use alone . Results laboratory study perform institution suggest add Rapamune Herceptin may also reverse resistance Herceptin . Although extensive experience use Herceptin alone Rapamune alone human subject , combination Herceptin Rapamune previously evaluate . In addition , hope good understand treatment work individual woman 's tumor analyze tissue sample , treatment .</brief_summary>
