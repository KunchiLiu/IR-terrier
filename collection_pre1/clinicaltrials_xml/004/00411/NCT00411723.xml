	<brief_summary>RTL1000 new agent previously test human . It think RTL may specifically control abnormal immune response attack insulation nerve occur multiple sclerosis . The purpose study evaluate possible side effect single intravenous dose RTL1000 subject multiple sclerosis . Some subject also ask participate one two substudies , one test blood sample see body 's immune system respond administration RTL1000 , test blood sample see body absorbs eliminate RTL1000 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study RTL1000 ( Recombinant T Cell Receptor Ligand ) Subjects With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled treatment protocol six treatment cohort , receive single intravenous infusion escalate dose RTL1000 . Each dose group six subject : two receive single dose placebo four receive single dose RTL1000 . Subjects observed hospital infusion 24 hour afterward , follow weekly 28 day 1 2 month post-infusion evaluate safety parameter . Objectives study evaluate safety profile single dose RTL1000 administer intravenous infusion , evaluate pharmacokinetic profile RTL1000 subset subject , evaluate feasibility assess immunologic parameter subset subject . Endpoints include vital sign , electrocardiogram physical examination result , adverse event , serious adverse event safety laboratory parameter ( e.g. , clinical chemistry hematology value ) . Disease parameter , neurological finding , expand disability status scale ( EDSS ) , 25-ft time walk , 9-hole peg test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure ensure study treatment make disease bad . Subjects also test begin end study antibody drug component .</detailed_description>
