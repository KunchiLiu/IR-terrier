	<brief_summary>A randomize control trial show benefit vasopressin versus epinephrine inhospital cardiac arrest . Preceding laboratory data suggest combine vasopressin epinephrine ensure long-term survival neurologic recovery . Also , postresuscitation abnormality mimic severe sepsis . The investigator hypothesize combined vasopressin epinephrine cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , steroid supplementation ( require ) CPR may improve survival cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhospital cardiac arrest still constitute important clinical problem survival discharge range within 0-42 % ( common range = 15-20 % ) . Survival witness , pulseless ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia ( VF/VT ) responsive one two direct current countershock ( ) may exceed 30 % . However , survival inhospital asystole , pulseless electrical activity , refractory VF/VT ( define responsive two countershocks ) may substantially lower ( &lt; 5-10 % ) . As nonsurvivors , endogenous vasopressin adrenocorticotrophin reduce compare survivor , hypothesize addition exogenous vasopressin steroid standard CPR protocol may increase rate return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) post-arrest survival . The mechanistic basis hypothesis comprise simultaneous activation adrenergic vasopressin receptor , conjunction potential steroid-mediated enhancement vascular reactivity epinephrine . Adult in-patients cardiac arrest responsive two direct current countershocks ( applicable ) asystole pulseless electrical activity randomize receive either arginine vasopressin ( Pitressin , 20 IU/CPR cycle first 5 CPR-cycles non-VF/VT second sixth CPR-cycle VF/VT ) plus epinephrine ( 1 mg/CPR-cycle ) plus methylprednisolone ( single dose = 40 mg first second CPR-cycle non-VF/VT VF/VT , respectively ) normal saline-placebo plus epinephrine ( 1 mg/CPR-cycle ) plus normal saline-placebo first 5 second sixth CPR-cycles . Further CPR-vasopressor treatment include epinephrine ( 1 mg/CPR-cycle ) group . Apart initial , combine drug administration study group , CPR conduct full concordance 2005 European Resuscitation Council Guidelines . Following ROSC presence postresuscitation shock ( define inability maintain mean arterial pressure &gt; 70 mm Hg without use exogenous catecholamine infusion rate confer vasopressor and/or inotropic activity ) , study group patient receive stress dose hydrocortisone ( 300 mg/day maximum 7 day gradual taper ) , whereas control receive saline placebo . Following ROSC , control group patient may receive stress dose steroid treatment prescribe attend physician indication septic shock know adrenocortical insufficiency . This hold also study group patient follow-up period . Any steroid prescription attend physician cancel concomitant investigational intervention regard steroid supplementation . The investigator involve CPR drug administration blind use ( no-use ) vasopressin methylprednisolone , coordinate CPR procedure . For study group , steroid treatment determine director pharmacy Evaggelismos hospital , also perform computer-based patient randomization encoding , supervise preparation study drug CPR . Patient follow-up data record conduct four associate unaware CPR intervention . Daily follow-up day 28 post-arrest include physiological variable , medication treatment intervention , result laboratory diagnostic study ( include serum interleukin ) , determination sequential organ dysfunction assessment ( SOFA ) score . Physiological variable include hemodynamics ( arterial central venous pressure , heart rate ) , gas exchange respiratory mechanic , body temperature , urinary output fluid balance . Patient neurological status assess Glasgow Coma Score . Following successful wean mechanical ventilation , cerebral performance assess cerebral performance scale . Additional follow-up data include hospital/intensive care unit ( ICU ) -related morbidity , length ICU/hospital stay , cerebral performance/residual disability hospital discharge . Primary end-points ROSC â‰¥ 15 min , survival discharge either home rehabilitation facility . Secondary end-points include arterial pressure CPR 15-20 min follow ROSC , intensity post-arrest systemic inflammatory response , number organ failure-free day follow-up , neurological status cerebral performance follow discharge hospital . In patient survive 28 day occurrence cardiac arrest , ultimately feasible collect full data organ failure free day medication 60 day follow randomization . Consequently , analysis data April May 2007 , actually enable calculation organ failure free day , comparison length use various drug two group , construction survival curve conduct Kaplan-Meier analysis Cox regression analysis day 60 follow randomization . As previous cardiac arrest trial , requirement inform consent administration drug combination CPR waive . Informed consent actually obtain corticosteroid treatment postresuscitation shock blood sampling require determination plasma cytokine concentration ROSC .</detailed_description>
