	<brief_summary>Primary Objective The primary objective phase I-II study evaluate : - Phase I : Assess maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bortezomib weekly schedule bevacizumab give every 3 week . - Phase II : Using MTD establish phase I , assess efficacy combination indicate progression-free survival . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective study evaluate : - Response rate duration response - 1 year survival - Overall survival - Qualitative quantitative toxicity - Circulating endothelial cell ( CECs ) prior treatment , prior cycle 2 , and/or time progression</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bortezomib design enter cell interfere substance find inside cell responsible allow cell divide . Avastin® design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel . If find eligible take part study , depend enroll , assign one 4 treatment group . There 3 participant first group , additional 30 participant last group . The first ( 2 3 ) group part first phase study , last group ( 3rd 4th ) part second phase . All participant receive dose level Avastin® . The amount bortezomib receive depend enroll study . The exact dose bortezomib receive base height weight . In first phase study , group participant assign one 2 bortezomib dose level . The first group receive high dose . The next group receive either dose level , intolerable side effect occur , low dose level . For second part study , last group receive high dose level cause intolerable side effect group . A cycle treatment 3 week ( 21 day ) . Bortezomib give week first 2 week cycle . Avastin® give every 3 week . ( On Day 1 cycle , receive bortezomib Avastin® . ) Bortezomib inject needle vein . Each injection last 3-5 second . After receive dose bortezomib , clinic staff check well tolerate drug . During time , ask side effect may experience . Your doctor may decrease pause dose bortezomib experience certain side effect . Avastin® give infusion needle vein , 90 minute . If tolerate 90-minute infusion well , second infusion give 60 minute . If tolerate 60-minute infusion well , follow infusion give 30 minute . If tolerate short infusion time , future infusion time increase tolerable level reach . Every 3 week , physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You performance status evaluation . On Day 8 cycle treatment , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . The level protein urine monitor least every 6 week . You may continue receive study treatment long cancer respond treatment 1 year . Your doctor may decide take study experience intolerable side effect health get bad . After stop take study treatment , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You performance status evaluation , chest x-ray , CT MRI scan . On indefinite basis , study nurse contact telephone time time see . This investigational study . Bortezomib FDA approve register Europe treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least one prior therapy . Avastin® FDA approve treatment metastatic colorectal cancer non-small cell lung cancer . However , bortezomib Avastin® FDA-approved type cancer , authorize use together research . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
