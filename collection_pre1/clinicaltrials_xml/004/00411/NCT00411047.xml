	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective tumor response rate patient previously untreated stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer somatic activate mutation TK region epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene treat gefitinib . Secondary - Determine response duration , progression-free survival , overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine safety drug patient . - Compare ability various somatic activating mutation TK region EGFR gene predict response patient treated drug . - Compare ability various somatic activating mutation TK region EGFR gene predict toxicity drug patient . - Define molecular profile patient initially respond treatment drug subsequently progress therapy . - Determine significance germline polymorphism EGFR gene , somatic amplification EGFR gene , molecular factor association clinical outcome parameter patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
