	<brief_title>A Randomized , Open-Label , Single-Dose , Small Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Hydromorphone Patients With Short Term , Moderate Severe Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , open-label , single dose small study . During 36 hour study period , concomitant analgesic ( pain ) medication physical therapy record patient 's case report form . The study duration patient 36 hour single dose OROS hydromorphone HCI administer . After surgery , eligible patient tolerate liquid , swallow tablet , audible bowel sound . Before OROS hydromorphone HCI administer , analgesic medication discontinue patient pain score 2 ( moderate pain ) 3 ( severe pain ) upon movement eligible enter study receive single oral dose OROS hydromorphone HCI . Patients stable heart rate , blood pressure , respiration , oxygen saturation great equal 94 % patient undergone regional anesthesia motor sensory recovery nerve blockade . Qualifying patient give OROS hydromorphone HCI 6 48 hour completion surgical procedure . Patients randomize 3 group ( OROS hydromorphone HCI 8 , 16 , 32 mg ) . The precise time OROS hydromorphone HCI administration consider time zero . To maintain consistency , dose occur 6 2 pm , possible . Following study drug administration , patient could give rescue medication oral hydromorphone immediate-release tablet ( 2 4 mg ) breakthrough pain need . Oxygen saturation , vital sign , pain relief rating , pain intensity rating rest upon movement obtain 2-hour time interval first 8 hour follow study drug administration , 4 hour interval 8 36 hour follow study drug administration . The study conclude 36 hour dose , time global evaluation pain relief obtain patient . One single dose OROS hydromorphone HCI ( 8 , 16 , 32 mg ) administer orally begin 36 hour study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients undergoing primary , unilateral total knee replacement surgery use opioid analgesic shortterm postoperative pain require At baseline must able tolerate oral liquid , swallow tablet , presence bowel sound upon examination Patients must demonstrate stable vital sign immediately dose OROS hydromorphone HCI At baseline pain intensity upon movement must score patient 2 3 ( moderate severe ) Pain Intensity Rating Scale At baseline patient receive regional anesthetics/analgesics must demonstrate recovery motor sensory effect nerve blockade Patients must administer OROS hydromorphone HCI 6 48 hour follow completion surgery Patients expect remain hospitalized 36 hour study drug administration . Patients either intolerant hydromorphone experience anaphylactic IgEmediated immune response ( e.g . hive , wheeze , angioedema bronchospasm ) opioid agonist Patients previously undergone follow major surgery high tibial osteotomy , knee arthroplasty affected knee Patients gastrointestinal disorder , include preexist severe GI narrowing ( pathologic iatrogenic ) may affect absorption transit orally administer drug Patients pregnant breastfeeding .
