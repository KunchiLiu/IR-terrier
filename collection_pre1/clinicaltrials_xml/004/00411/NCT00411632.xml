	<brief_title>BATTLE Program : Tarceva Targretin Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib hydrochloride design help block activity enzyme believe play important role cell growth . Researchers want find blocking enzyme slow tumor growth . Bexarotene design control cancer cell growth division . In order enroll study , must also enrol Protocol 2005-0823 : A Biomarker-integrated study Chemorefractory Patients Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer . Protocol 2005-0823 screening study group study call BATTLE program . Participants Protocol 2005-0823 assigned one research study . The result tumor analysis help study doctor determine assign particular research study . While study , take erlotinib hydrochloride bexarotene mouth day . Erlotinib hydrochloride tablet take preferably morning 1 hour 2 hour meal 7 ounce water . If forget take dose , last miss dose take soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose due take . The next day , take schedule dose usual time . Bexarotene capsule take immediately meal . If miss dose , take soon possible , food . However , nearly time next dose , skip miss dose continue dose schedule . Every attempt make keep vomiting medication least 30 minute take . For example , feel nauseated take medication , anti-nausea medication use . The erlotinib hydrochloride tablet bexarotene capsule store room temperature . Bexarotene capsule store near heat device , high temperature humidity , child pet access . Bexarotene capsule protect sunlight . Every 4 week ( 1 cycle ) medical history record physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature , breathe rate ) weight . You routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) performance status evaluation ( question ability perform everyday activity ) . You blood draw ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check thyroid function . You also blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check lipid profile weekly first 4 week every cycle . Your study doctor also ask medication take smoke history . Every 2 cycle , tumor evaluate chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate status disease . If take Coumadin® ( warfarin ) , blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clot function weekly first 5 week treatment every cycle . You may continue receive erlotinib hydrochloride bexarotene long cancer respond study treatment . Your doctor may decide take study experience intolerable side effect , medical condition get bad , unable comply study requirement . If stop study treatment , may able enroll 1 remain 3 protocols BATTLE program . After stop take study treatment , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You also blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood clotting function . You performance status evaluation , chest x-ray , CT MRI scan . Following evaluation , contact telephone every 3 month 3 year , see . This investigational study . Erlotinib hydrochloride approve FDA treatment NSCLC patient relapse . Bexarotene approve FDA treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . Their use together study investigational . Up 72 patient take part multicenter study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
