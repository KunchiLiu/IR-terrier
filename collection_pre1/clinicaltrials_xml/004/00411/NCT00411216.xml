	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether exercise relieve symptom dizziness imbalance people vestibular deficit improve ability see clearly head movement . We hypothesize performance specific adaptation substitution exercise result improvement visual acuity head movement patient perform placebo exercise show improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recovery Visual Acuity People With Vestibular Deficits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decrements visual acuity head movement patient vestibular hypofunction potentially serious problem . This deficit could contribute decreased activity level , avoidance driving resultant diminish independence , ultimately , limited social interaction increase isolation . Oscillopsia occur inadequate vestibulo-ocular reflex ( VOR ) gain suggest compensation vestibular loss occur . The purpose study examine effect exercise intervention visual acuity head movement patient unilateral bilateral vestibular hypofunction . We hypothesize 1 ) patient perform vestibular exercise would improve visual acuity head movement compare patient perform placebo exercise ; 2 ) would correlation dynamic visual acuity ( DVA ) patient ' subjective complaint oscillopsia ; 3 ) improvement DVA would reflect change residual vestibular function indicate increase VOR gain . Patients assign randomly either vestibular exercise placebo exercise group . The randomization schedule generate use computer program 2-sample randomization . The sequence conceal investigator obtain consent subject supervise exercise ( SJH ) . The group assignment ( vestibular exercise placebo exercise ) conceal participant investigator perform outcome measure . The vestibular exercise group practice exercise consist adaptation exercise eye-head exercise target ( Table 1 ) , design improve gaze stability 16 . They also perform gait balance exercise . The placebo exercise group perform exercise design 'vestibular-neutral ' .</detailed_description>
