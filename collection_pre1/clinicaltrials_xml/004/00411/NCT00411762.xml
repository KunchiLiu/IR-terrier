	<brief_summary>The aim research project determine amount capecitabine ( Xeloda ) give safely PHY906 ( investigational drug ) novel schedule . It also aim research project determine effect , good and/or bad , combine capecitabine ( Xeloda ) PHY906 ( investigational drug ) treatment advanced pancreatic cancer . PHY906 powder plant sell health food supplement United States . PHY906 use China , Taiwan Asian country traditional Chinese medicine hundred year . The drug involve study , capecitabine oral form chemotherapy already approve FDA management colorectal breast cancer . Laboratory study animal model show combination capecitabine PHY906 shrink liver cancer , pilot clinical study currently evaluate combination patient liver cancer define benefit . PHY906 also show decrease diarrhea relate chemotherapy small study perform patient colon cancer treat Yale Cancer Center . Our recent laboratory study also show combination capecitabine PHY906 also shrink pancreatic tumor mouse model . This prompt u test combination capecitabine PHY906 patient advance pancreatic cancer ass benefit survival well decrease side effect , diarrhea cause capecitabine .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men woman ≥18 year age either histologic cytologic diagnosis locally advance metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . However , patient solid malignancy allow participate dose escalate Phase I part study , fail respond standard therapy standard therapy exist . In phase I portion , patient may either prior chemotherapy ( chemotherapy naive ) , refractory relapse standard chemotherapy , include capecitabinebased regimen . However , phase II portion study , pancreatic cancer patient prior gemcitabine therapy eligible . No prior 5FU/capecitabine chemotherapy allow EXCEPT previous adjuvant treatment 5FU capecitabine ( radiosensitizing dose ) radiation complete least 6 week prior study entry . All patient phase I phase II portion study must least one previously unirradiated , unidimensionally measurable lesion computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ≥ 20 mm ( conventional CT scan ) ≥ 10 mm ( spiral CT scan ) . Patients biliary gastroduodenal obstruction must drainage pas prior start chemotherapy . Patients adequate hepatic function define AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 X ULN ; Total Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 XULN ; Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ 5 X ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) ; Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ 2.5 X ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) . Patients adequate renal function indicate serum creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min . ( Calculated CockcroftGault equation ) . Baseline performance status must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 , 1 , 2 . Women patient know capable conception negative serum pregnancy test ( betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ betahCG ] ) within 2 week start study ; patient agree use adequate nonestrogenic birth control method , consistent institute 's standard form contraception conception possible study . Provide write informed consent prior screen . Patients adequate hematologic test : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL ; Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10 9/L ; Platelet count ≥ 100.0 x 10 9/L ; Patients pregnant breastfeed . Any prior palliative radiation therapy ( use adjuvant therapy pancreatic cancer &gt; 6 week ) must complete 21 day entry study evaluable lesion must include radiation portal . Patients prior capecitabine therapy pancreatic cancer ( Phase II ) . Patients active CNS metastasis . Patients known hypersensitivity history mark intolerance 5FU ineligible . Because cimetidine decrease clearance 5FU , patient enter study cimetidine discontinue . Patients receive concurrent therapy either sorivudine brivudine , receive capecitabine . If patient receive prior sorivudine brivudine , least four week must elapse patient receives capecitabine therapy . Exclude sexually active male unwilling practice contraception study . Lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract , inability swallow tablet malabsorption syndrome . Clinically significant cardiac disease well control medication ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease , cardiac arrhythmia ) myocardial infarction within last 12 month . No concurrent radiotherapy allow . Known DPD ( dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ) deficiency . Patients receive previous treatment consist standard chemotherapy ( gemcitabine Phase II study ; others Phase I ) within 21 day investigational agent ( Phase I ) within 30 day study . Toxicity relate previous therapy must resolve prior study entry . Patients previous concurrent malignancy except inactive nonmelanoma skin cancer and/or situ carcinoma cervix , solid tumor treat curatively without evidence recurrence within last 3 year prior study entry . Patients take herbal medicine ( ) , include supplement ( ) , eligible discontinue herbal medicine ( ) /supplement ( ) least 7 day prior study entry . Known allergy hypersensitivity PHY906 component use PHY906 formulation , capecitabine . Serious concurrent medical illness , would jeopardize ability patient receive chemotherapy program outline protocol reasonable safety . Patients active infection require intravenous antibiotic therapy eligible infection resolve .</criteria>
