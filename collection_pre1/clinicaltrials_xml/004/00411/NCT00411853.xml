	<brief_summary>We propose study treat hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) patients. , novel preparation ferment wheat germ nutriment ( FWGE ) , combination 1st line hormone therapy , gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) , stop effective . The study conduct two year 60 patient . The efficacy assess term clinical serological response specific questionnaire . This concept base previous report regard disease colon cancer , addition new drug drug previously fail , improved patient ' survival , quality life clinical parameter . In addition , preclinical data show activity regimen prostate cancer cell line animal ' model . FWGE exhibit wide variety mode action , wide range malignant tumor . It increase natural immune response decrease systemic inflammation often present cancer patient . It reduce growth human prostate tumor xenograft mouse prolong survival . It delay disease progression , increase overall survival , improve quality life reduce oxidative stress . The long-term goal research addition FWGE drug previously fail , would slow disease progression patient advance thus refractory cancer , improve patient ' quality life , clinical parameter survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy FWGE Combination With Hormone Therapy Treatment Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance 1 . The challenge : Prostate cancer major worldwide health problem frequently diagnose malignancy men today . In United States prostate cancer common malignancy find men account 29 % diagnosed cancer approximately 13 % cancer death . Nearly one six men diagnose disease time live . In 2003 alone , estimate 221,000 men United States diagnose prostate cancer . In 1999 , 37,000 death attribute prostate cancer United States , 2003 28,000 die disease . Hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) one aggressive cancer . It second ranking cause cancer-related death . Patients localized disease option radiation therapy radical prostatectomy definitive treatment modality cure disease . However cancer recur metastatic form 20-30 % patient . In addition , approximately 10 % patient diagnosed disease already distant metastasis , make localized therapy irrelevant . The primary treatment advance state prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy , inhibit testosterone production facilitates prostate tumor growth . Androgen deprivation therapy administer either surgical castration medication block testosterone production . While treatment effective 85 % -95 % patient , response time last approximately 12 -24 month , cancer progress androgen-insensitive stage . The androgen independent prostate cancer cell progress metastatic disease . Limited treatment option exist hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) patient , median survival time rarely exceed one year . Once androgen independence occur , conventional chemotherapy treatment metastatic cancer show limited activity patient addition cause toxic side effect . While new chemotherapeutic regimen hormonal agent test , survival quality life HRPC patient remain low . 2 . The innovation : We propose treat progress HRPC patient novel combination 1st line hormone therapy ( GnRH analogue ) non-toxic dietary supplement ferment wheat germ nutriment ( FWGE ) . This suggestion base preclinical data show activity regimen prostate cancer cell line animal model . Furthermore , previous report regard disease colon cancer , addition new treatment therapy previously fail , improved patient survival , quality life clinical parameter . The characteristic Fermented wheat germ extract ( FWGE ) Fermented wheat germ extract standardize complex mixture molecule term FWGE . The product manufacture GMP condition , available water-soluble granulate , administer orally . The compound approve medical food cancer patient . It recently classify US GRAS ( Generally Recognized Safe ) , use complement standard anticancer treatment . The molecular target FWGE include poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I , transketolase ( TK ) , ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) , intracellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) 1 . By activate caspase-3 downstream protease , FWGE treatment result cleavage PARP thus , prevent DNA repair cancer cell . FWGE treatment decrease major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) cancer cell . MHC-I regulation cancer cell lead increased natural killer ( NK ) cell ' activity . NK cell consider first line anticancer immune defense . TK key enzyme reductive pentose cycle . In cancer cell cycle responsible supply cell ' increase need ribose molecule necessary synthesis sugar chain nucleic acid . RNR enzymes , strongly inhibit FWGE , catalyze synthesis DNA component . It known tumor grow big 2 mm diameter except able synthesize blood vessel ( angiogenesis process ) . The blood vessel tumor lack protein ICAM-1 , responsible facilitate transfer anticancer immune cell ( e. g. macrophage ) via vessel ' wall tumor . FWGE treatment increase synthesis ICAM-1 . In addition , FWGE wide therapeutic window : In order observe toxicity ( effect normal cell ) , 50 time high dosage FWGE recommend one therapy need . This positive toxicity profile give wide therapeutic window applicability product . Recently , also show FWGE strong , non-selective inhibitor cyclooxygenases 1 2 thus , preparation anti-inflammatory activity . The preparation also show induce apoptosis gastric carcinoma cell . Advantages FWGE : - The FWGE preparation non-toxic safe . This serve major consideration selection treatment advance cancer patient suffer low performance status consequently poor quality life . - FWGE orally administrate . - The FWGE preparation exhibit wide variety mode action , wide range malignant tumor . - The product able increase natural immune response , decrease systemic inflammation often present patient . - It anticipate FWGE , complement therapeutic efficacy standard hormonal anticancer treatment , could suppress disease progression , thus prolong patient ' survival improve quality life parameter .</detailed_description>
