	<brief_title>A 10 Week Open-Label Pilot Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Memantine ( Namenda ) Augmentation Therapy Patients With Generalized Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Memantine FDA approve treatment help slow progression Alzheimer 's dementia.. It felt high glutamate level associate Alzheimer 's dementia toxic neuron ultimately die cause dementia process continue . Memantine partially block NMDA glutamate channel locate neuron brain . This way , glutamate rise , toxic activity blunt neuron tend become less toxic suffer less atrophy death . Glutamate felt play role development anxiety well . Glutamate often balance another neurotransmitter , GABA . This GABA-glutamate balance ( GABA low Glutamate normal high ) also felt play role development GAD SAD . Low GABA high glutamate level ( similar state alcohol withdrawal ) implicate cause anxiety symptom . Sometimes , GABA-increasing sedative drug , diazepam ( Valium ) use raise GABA activity ward anxiety symptom create good balance stimulatory glutamate inhibitory GABA . Given memantine 's ability lower glutamate level , may able also low anxiety without need sedative medication . Lowering glutamate way , may allow patient 's GABA concentration effective lower GAD SAD symptom . The usual treatment initial treatment anxiety use serotonin neurotransmitter enhance drug , paroxetine escitalopram . These 'SSRI ' drug , unlike sedative note , addiction potential safer use . In anxiety disorder population , 30-70 % patient achieve full remission anxiety symptom place SSRI monotherapy . The usual second-line choice treat serotonin-norepinephrine enhance SNRI , venlafaxineXR order achieve remission . If resistance occur SNRI , promote full anxiety symptom relief , addition GABA enhancing-sedative ( raise GABA balance ) SNRI reasonable polypharmacy strategy . Sedatives , like alprazolam , addictive consider third line agent . The author feel memantine , give ability manipulate GABA-glutamate balance lower glutamate without major side effect ( weight gain , sexual problem , ( ie SSRI/SNRI ) addiction ( ie sedative ) may reasonable add-on augmentation strategy well alleviate anxiety SNRI SSRI partial responder . This study design evaluate generally socially anxious patient partially responsive typical SNRI SSRI anti-anxiety medication therapy . Patients less 50 % anxiety-alleviated SNRI medication ask join study place memantine well . This type add-on therapy common outpatient psychiatric care . This rater-blinded , patient open-label , non-placebo prospective pilot study , subject receive memantine 10 week . This study would first date treatment-resistant patient population , investigator utilize comprehensive set rating scale date order best categorize patient response regard anxiety drug .</detailed_description>
