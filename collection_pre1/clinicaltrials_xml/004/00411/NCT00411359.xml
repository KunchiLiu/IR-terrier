	<brief_title>Cardiac Rehabilitation Treatment Refractory Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority patient present angina pectoris result coronary artery disease ( CHD ) successfully treat intervention include coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) medical management . However , grow number patient experience persistent angina spite intervention optimal medical treatment . Such patient refer suffer 'refractory angina ' . Currently , cardiac rehabilitation centre reluctant accept patient ongoing angina complicate cardiovascular history , spite duration stability symptom . Indeed , angina heart failure often used exclude patient cardiac rehabilitation . However , recent updated American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommendation exercise training , cardiac rehabilitation supervise exercise training recommend patient ongoing angina , previous history CABG , MI , PTCA patient exist cardiomyopathy order promote reduction myocardial ischaemia rest sub-maximal exercise , reduce risk progression CHD . Nevertheless , study explore physiological psychological impact routinely available CR stand-alone intervention among refractory angina patient previously undertaken . Until study perform , CR practitioner continue refuse accept refractory angina patient participation CR . Research question : - Is eight-week cardiac rehabilitation exercise programme appropriate treatment option patient refractory angina ? - Does eight-week cardiac rehabilitation exercise programme improve physical function cardiovascular health patient refractory angina ? - Is symptom severity frequency reduce follow eight-week cardiac rehabilitation exercise programme patient refractory angina ? - Does eight-week cardiac rehabilitation exercise programme impact anxiety , depression , cardiac anxiety quality life patient refractory angina ? - Are physiological psychological effect acquire patient refractory angina participate cardiac rehabilitation exercise programme maintain eight-week follow-up ? The study conceive randomise intervention-control study standard , routinely available Phase III hospital-based CR program among patient refractory angina . Patients randomly assign eight-week CR programme base Harefield Hospital symptom diary monitoring control group .</detailed_description>
