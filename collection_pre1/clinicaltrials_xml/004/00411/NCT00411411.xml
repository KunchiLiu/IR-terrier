	<brief_title>Long Term Effects DPP-IV Inhibitor Treatment Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The incretin effect , primarily mediate peptide hormone GIP GLP-1 , know impaired patient type 2 diabetes , characterise reduce GLP-1 secretion potency lack responsiveness insulinotropic effect GIP . The cause defect remain unknown , exogenous administration GLP-1 show promising result attempt restore incretin effect . Due rapid degradation incretin hormone enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase IV ( DPP-IV ) , treatment strategy focus GLP-1 analogue prevention hormone degradation DPP-IV inhibition . Hypothesis We hypothesize gradual improvement metabolic control induce DPP-IV inhibitor ( Januvia® ) treatment significantly ameliorate impaired secretion potency GLP-1 lead restoration lose action GIP . Objective To assess effect three month treatment Januvia® , administer tablet daily , metabolic control metformin treat patient type 2 diabetes , measure increase incretin hormone insulin secretion . Efficacy end point Primary efficacy end point trial part one relative increase meal-induced total GLP-1 secretion one twelve week Januvia® treatment . Primary efficacy end point part two restoration insulinotropic effect GIP , measure relative increase GIP induce amplification late phase insulin secretion ( AUC ) response glucose 12 week Januvia® treatment . Secondary objective examination GLP-2 , somatostatin , glucagon , peptide-YY two glycaemic control parameter ( HbA1c fast plasma glucose ) Design This single centre , randomize , double blind , placebo control trial . The trial consist two part , consist three month inhibitor treatment . In part , 24 patient , recruit Diabetes Outpatient Clinic Gentofte University Hospital , randomize treatment supplement either Januvia® placebo . Procedures During trial , patient test well establish procedure . In part one , patient undergo standardized meal test two β-cell secretory capacity test . In part two , patient undergo standardized hyperglycaemic GIP , GLP-1 saline clamp . Safety The trial short time span three month . With ten visit time regular blood sampling , patient well monitor .</detailed_description>
