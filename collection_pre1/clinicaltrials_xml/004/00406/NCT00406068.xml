	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy safety intravesical Mycobacterial Cell Wall-DNA Complex ( MCC ) patient non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma ( papillary tumor and/or carcinoma situ ) urinary bladder high risk progression refractory therapy bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycobacterial Cell Wall-DNA Complex Treatment BCG-refractory Patients With Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide 3 phase : Induction , Maintenance , Follow-up . The Induction Phase cover period 6 week . During time , patient receive 6 weekly intravesical instillation 8 mg MCC . The patient evaluate month 3 , time patient enter Maintenance Phase . The Maintenance Phase last month 3 month 24 , time , patient receive weekly MCC instillation three week month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 evaluation perform month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 . At month 3 , patient evaluate assure disease progressing . Cytology , cystoscopy biopsy perform obtain adequate staging ( residual tumor persists ) . If patient disease-free , maintenance therapy initiate . Patients non-muscle invasive tumor month 3 , discretion investigator , receive either second 6-week induction course 3-week maintenance course . Patients show progression muscle invasive disease refer treatment . At month 6 thereafter evaluation visit , patient evaluate manage accord follow result : - Patients disease-free continue maintenance treatment . - Patients disease-free ( evidence papillary lesion , CIS muscle invasive disease ) withdrawn study treatment refer therapy discretion investigator . The final 36 month study Follow-up Phase . Evaluations perform month 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 54 60 . Efficacy evaluation include standard cystoscopy , biopsy urine cytology . During Maintenance Phase , standard cystoscopies perform month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 surveillance bladder tumor . During month instillation perform , cystoscopies conduct month . During Follow-up Phase , cystoscopies perform month 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 54 60 . Mandatory bladder biopsy do patient month 6 . During course study , biopsy take evident suspicious lesion see cystoscopy case negative cystoscopy positive cytology .</detailed_description>
