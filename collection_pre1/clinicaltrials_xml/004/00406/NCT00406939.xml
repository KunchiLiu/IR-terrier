	<brief_summary>This study design determine safety IL-12 gene therapy patient recurrence prostate cancer radiation therapy without metastatic disease prostate gland intact . These , course , would include recurrent prostate cancer definitive radiation therapy . The prostate cancer treat prostatic injection replication-defective adenovirus vector deliver IL-12 gene . Following virus injection , patient hospitalize 23 hour observation . Only one course therapy administer . Each patient carefully monitor toxic effect . Three five patient test low dose virus serious adverse side effect , dose slowly escalate subsequent group 3-5 patient unacceptable toxicity reach . Effectiveness monitor serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , transrectal ultrasound prostate , prostate biopsy comparison survival time historical survival time patient radiation recurrent prostate tumor . The primary objective initial study determine whether treatment associate significant toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The development clinical trial gene therapy prostate cancer coordinate collaborator Baylor involve similar study order facilitate approval process . We submit proposal NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ( RAC ) committee accelerate review . A detailed clinical protocol inform consent Phase I clinical trial gene therapy prostate cancer approve Baylor Affiliates Review Board FDA . Human subject include project limit men biopsy-proven local recurrence persistence cancer prostate gland without metastatic disease hormone therapy , cryosurgery and/or definitive irradiation therapy . Patients biopsy-proven prostate cancer , clinical stage T1-T3 , Nx-N1 M0-M1 eligible . Biologically active local recurrence tumor define biopsy-proven cancer prostate , least one year completion radiation therapy , patient rise serum PSA level least 3 separate occasion least 2 week apart . Patients also carefully follow document toxicity , use standard CTEP toxicity criterion . Responses categorize follow : progressive disease , stable disease , partial objective response , complete objective response . Progressive disease define rise serum PSA level 25 % first 3 month thereafter , positive biopsy conjunction enlarge nodule digital rectal exam enlarge hypoechoic lesion ultrasound , development new symptom clearly related cancer presence positive biopsy , presence biopsy cancer high grade cancer extensive . A complete response define serum PSA level decrease less 1 ng/ml , combination negative biopsy prostate absence symptom referable cancer . A partial objective response would PSA level decrease least 50 % compare baseline association biopsy result show clearly diminish minimum persistent cancer cell . This Phase I study design evaluate safety Adv/IL-12 gene therapy intent offer potential therapeutic advantage . The potential risk associate use gene therapy group would appear reasonable far evaluation frequent progression ( occur ) find early allow rapid movement patient possible therapy . Effectiveness monitor serum PSA , transrectal ultrasound prostate , prostate biopsy comparison survival time historical survival time patient radiation recurrent prostate tumor . Additional research laboratory analyse perform evaluate immune response engender gene therapy protocol . This consist analysis serum and/or plasma urine systemic cytokine production use standard ELISA methodology perform previous study . In addition collect whole blood analysis T cell flow cytometry . We establish protocol analysis detect total CD4 CD8 cell well express marker activation HLA/DR .</detailed_description>
