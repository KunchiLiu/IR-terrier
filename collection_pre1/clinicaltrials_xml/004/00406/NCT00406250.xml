	<detailed_description>To investigate safety efficacy intravitreal bevacizumab patient choroidal neovascularization associate angioid streak . One serious ocular complication angioid streak occurrence choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) implication macula , complication usually lead central vision loss . During past , laser photocoagulation , first , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , recently , use treatment kind CNV . The outcome therapy often variable sometimes disappointing stabilization visual acuity lesion size CNV secondary AS . Five patient ( six eye ) CNV secondary AS participate retrospective interventional case series . All patient schedule three monthly IVB injection ( 1.25 mg ) . Two eye previously treat photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , four receive IVB first choice treatment . IVB repeat case recurrence three monthly IVB schedule . Ophthalmic evaluation include : best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) determination ( ETDRS ) , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , fluorescein indocyanine green angiography . Main outcome measure BCVA improvement , reduction leakage CNV diminution central retinal thickness ( CRT ) . Patients followed-up 30 month . Patients 3 male 2 female age 44 67 year ( mean 51.6 +/- 9.07 SD ) , receive mean number 4.33 IB treatment ( +/-1.5 ; min : 3 , max : 7 ) . The mean retreatment interval 3 month ( +/-1.36 ; min : 2 , max : 6 ) . Four eye ( 66.6 % ) show BCVA improvement ( mean 3.4 line ) baseline two eye ( 33.3 % ) show change visual acuity baseline last follow-up . Mean BCVA rise significantly 22.5+/-14.4 letter baseline 35.8+/-21.5 letter 30 month ( p=0.025 ) . Angiographic examination show reduction cessation CNV leakage patient . OCT finding demonstrate slight CRT diminution ( mean 41.6 Âµm ) . No intraocular pressure change observe IVB injection , cause systemic complication . No injection relate back pain IVB-induced ocular complication report .</detailed_description>
