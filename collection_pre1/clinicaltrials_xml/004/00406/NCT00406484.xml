	<detailed_description>The propose study plan compare efficacy behavioral drug HIV risk reduction counseling ( BDRC ) low intensity methadone counsel methadone maintenance treatment . In select BDRC , guide several consideration , include acceptability , suitability , feasibility , potential efficacy , potential rapid widespread dissemination U.S. elsewhere . BDRC develop deliver regular drug counselor , would relatively easy disseminate counseling find efficacious . BDRC combine behavioral contract Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills ( IMB ) model reduce HIV risk behavior illicit drug use ground social cognitive theory support empirical finding number study population . The intensive HIV risk reduction intervention provide BDRC , include personalize assessment risk ( i.e. , identification personal , social environmental factor associate risky behavior ) education train skill-building self-control , may lead great reduction drug- sex-related HIV risk behavior limit , brief counseling provide LIMC , support finding recent clinical trial methadone maintain patient meta-analysis regard effectiveness HIV risk reduction intervention drug abuse treatment . BDRC emphasize medical model treatment drug dependence highly complementary compatible regular methadone maintenance treatment . Because early abstinence achievement associate long term treatment success , BDRC use short-term behavioral contract help patient achieve initial period abstinence , take maintenance medication regularly prescribe , activate patient behaviorally , reduce behavior associate HIV transmission . The accomplishment specific , short-term behavioral goal early treatment promote patient 's experience therapeutic success counter patient 's belief his/her action lead success accomplish goal . Short-term behavioral goal target limited number domain , include achieve initial period abstinence , increase activity ( primarily vocational , social recreational ) relate drug use , reduce HIV risk behavior ( e.g. , foster consistent condom use , avoid casual sexual encounter , avoid IDU needle equipment share ) . BDRC teach cognitive behavioral strategy promote behavioral change , include identify antecedent drug use , needle sharing , high risk sexual behavior , learn strategy avoid high risk situation cope without engage behavior . Skill building exercise ( e.g. , regard condom use ) use within session learn practice new skill , patient encourage practice skill outside session natural environment . Based recent finding research cognitive social psychology message framing , treatment also emphasize positive consequence behavioral change ( e.g. , benefit use drug maintain steady relationship vs. danger associate continue use sex multiple partner ) . Counselors train acknowledge patient 's effort changeâ€”even partial accomplishment goal praise -- rather focus patient 's failure , often perceive criticism . Recognition accomplishment positively frame message generally evoke positive affect , often generalize ascribed behavior question , thus result great adherence recommendation . An emphasis recognition accomplishment positively-framed advice help patient build self-esteem sense change live well . Substance abuse think associate range memory executive function ( EFs ) deficit , majority research support hypothesis come research alcohol stimulant related disorder . The evidence long-term cognitive deficit chronic opiate user limit , nonetheless consistently suggest EFs may affect chronic opiate use . Because BDRC incorporate many cognitive behavioral therapeutic technique , include educational learning component aim improve decision make skill patient , plan evaluate broad range memory executive function patient enrol propose study order identify common EFs impairment , evaluate impairment interfere treatment efficacy , additional treatment component necessary devise order improve treatment efficacy patient cognitive impairment . We also plan evaluate cognitive performance improve methadone maintenance treatment combine BDRC evaluate whether presence absence impairment associate differential effect treatment .</detailed_description>
