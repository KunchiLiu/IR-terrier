	<brief_summary>In Japan , patient relapse refractory T-ALL/T-LBL represent extremely small patient population . While small number patient present practical limitation size clinical trial , patient whose disease respond relapsed treatment multiple prior chemotherapy regimen accept standard therapy available . Japanese leukemia expert express interest evaluate 506U78 Japanese patient relapsed refractory T-ALL/T-LBL . In order obtain safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic data 506U78 Japanese patient , study design maximize contribution available patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic cytogenetic document diagnosis TALL TLBL . Disease refractory least one prior chemotherapy regimen , relapse follow complete remission least one prior chemotherapy regimen . At least 4 week since last dose prior last chemotherapy , radiotherapy begin treatment 506U78 ( 2 week permit growth blast cell significant ) . Adequate function organ system measure follows.Serum creatinine le 1.5 time upper limit normal estimate creatinine clearance &gt; =50 mL/min . Hepatic transaminase ( SGPT SGOT ) &lt; =3 x upper limit normal , bilirubin less 1.5 time upper limit normal ( &lt; =5 x upper limit normal related TALL TLBL ) . Adequate performance status ( ECOGPS &lt; =2 ) . Capable give informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Patient willing accept hospitalization blood sample pharmacokinetic measurement ( i.e. , Cohort 1 : pharmacokinetic sample collection cycle 1 2 ; Cohort 2 : pharmacokinetic sample collection cycle 1 ) .
