	<brief_summary>Autoregulation ability vascular bed maintain blood flow despite change perfusion pressure . The existence effective autoregulation optic nerve circulation show animal human . The exact mechanism behind autoregulation still unknown . The motive investigation optic nerve head ( ONH ) blood flow autoregulation enhance understand pathologic eye condition associate ocular vascular disorder . To clarify regulatory mechanism ONH microcirculation critical importance understand pathophysiology glaucoma evidence glaucoma associate optic nerve head ischemia . Several study indicate disturb autoregulation might contribute glaucomatous optic neuropathy . Previous finding suggest endothelial dysfunction glaucomatous optic neuropathy , particular alteration endothelin- nitric oxide- system , play important role local regulation vascular tone . In present study , change ocular perfusion pressure perform administration drug , may potentially alter pressure-flow relationship . These drug include endothelin-1 nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine ( L-NMMA ) .</brief_summary>
