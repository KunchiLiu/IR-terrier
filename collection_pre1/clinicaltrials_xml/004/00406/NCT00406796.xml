	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether ranibizumab effective reduce eliminate macular edema associate disease , central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lucentis Central Retinal Vein Occlusion ( CRVO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinal Venous Occlusive disease second diabetic retinopathy major cause blindness associate retinal vascular disease . Macular edema major cause vision loss patient present central abd hemi vein occlusion . Currently , proven treatment address macular edema patient . In past laser photocoagulation use , find offer visual benefit natural history treatment macular edema associate CRVO . Investigators demonstrate case report intravitreal triamcinolone ( Kenalog ) may result reduction macular edema , lead visual improvement patient CRVO . Triamcinolone relatively well tolerate many patient , use associate significant risk elevate intraocular pressure , cataract , intraocular infection . Ranibizumab ( rhuFab V2 , anti-VEGF agent , potent inhibitor vascular permeability , potential reduce retinal vascular leakage diminish macular edema . In addition , anti-VEGF agent , may also inhibit neovascularization iris , frequent complication ischemic central retinal vein occlusion . Ranibizumab use intravitreal agent carry risk intraocular infection probably carry low risk glaucoma cataract formation , make potentially safer pharmacologic treatment CRVO associate macular edema compare triamcinolone</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study Age &gt; 18 year Clinical evidence perfuse central retinal vein occlusion . A central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) define eye retinal hemorrhage dilate retinal venous system 4 quadrant . Other evidence CRVO may include telangiectatic capillary bed collateral vessel optic nerve head . Central macular edema present clinical examination OCT test central point thickness &gt; 250 micron Visual acuity score great equal 19 letter ( 20/400 ) less equal 73 letter ( 20/40 ) ETDRS visual acuity protocol . Media clarity , pupillary dilation patient cooperation sufficient allow OCT test retinal photography Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) know pregnant , also premenopausal woman use adequate contraception . Participation another simultaneous ocular investigation trial Patient uncontrolled hypertension Patient condition , opinion investigator would preclude participation study ( i.e . chronic alcoholism , drug abuse ) Patient significant diabetic retinopathy ( great moderate NPDR ) macular edema associate diabetic retinopathy Exam OCT reveal evidence vitreoretinal interface abnormality may contribute macular edema Eye investigator chance improvement visual acuity follow resolution macular edema ( i.e subretinal fibrosis geographic atrophy ) Presence another ocular condition may affect visual acuity macular edema course study ( i.e AMD , uveitis , IrvineGas ) Evidence neovascularization iris retina ( presence ischemic CRVO ) Presence substantial cataract , one might decrease vision 3 line vision sometime study . History Grid/Focal laser Panretinal laser study eye History vitreous surgery study eye History use intravitreal , peribulbar , retrobulbar steroid within six month study . History Cataract Surgery within 6 month enrollment . History YAG capsulotomy within 2 month surgery . Visual acuity &lt; 20/400 fellow eye Uncontrolled Glaucoma , pressure &gt; 30 despite treatment glaucoma medication .</criteria>
