	<brief_title>Montelukast ENL Reaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leprosy still common medical problem many country include Bangladesh , currently least 3500 leprosy patient country risk ENL reaction , distress complication Multibacillary ( MB ) leprosy liable result permanent disability well treat . The drug choice either prednisolone ( often cause adverse effect especially prolong use ) thalidomide available Bangladesh.Clofazimine high dos recommend alternative supply difficult obtain . Hence need alternative drug could use steroid spar agent alternative steroid ENL reaction . Montelukast leukotriene inhibitor already available open market country immunomodulator , small clinical trial zafirlukast ( similar drug ) suggest drug group may effective ENL . This phase two trial ass safety efficacy montelukast alternative supplementarry treatment ENL reaction . Eligible patient present one participate hospital ENL reaction randomly allocate one three group receive prednisolone prednisolone plus montelukast montelukast alone . Any patient major contra-indications steroid put separate observational group receive montelukast . Drug regimens prednisolone start 40 mg od nd taper 12 week . Montelukast 10mg od 16 week . The patient monitor weekly 8 week monthly 4 month . At least 20 patient enrol group . The patient closely observed adverse effect , deteriorate receieve additional steroid accord protocol . Any develop new nerve function impairment remove trial give full course prednisolone . Analysis do intention treat basis look statistically significant difference ENL score 2 week , 12 week 24 week , difference number patient develop new nerve function impairment , well incidence severity adverse effect group .</detailed_description>
