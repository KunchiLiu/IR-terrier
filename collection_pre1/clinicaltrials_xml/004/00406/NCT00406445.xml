	<brief_summary>This study examine metabolic biological factor people Li-Fraumeni syndrome , rare hereditary disorder greatly increase person 's susceptibility cancer . Patients mutation p53 tumor suppressor gene , normally help control cell growth . This gene may control metabolism well cancer susceptibility , study finding may help improve understand cancer also condition , cardiovascular function . Healthy normal volunteer patient Li-Fraumeni syndrome family member may eligible study . Candidates must least 18 year age , overall good health cancer-free within 1 year enter study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Blood test routine lab value research purpose . - ECG echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) evaluate heart structure function . - Resting exercise metabolic stress testing : The subject first relaxes chair wear facemask exercise stationary bicycle treadmill wear mask . This test use facemask measure oxygen usage body determine metabolic fitness . Electrodes place body monitor heart identical manner standard exercise stress test . - Magnetic resonance image metabolism : The subject lie bed slide large magnet ( MRI scanner ) 60 minute . During scan , arm leg muscle stress inflate blood pressure cuff exercise limb several minute . Subjects may ask squeeze rubber ball exercise foot pedal . Immediately afterwards , pressure cuff release remain deflated 10 15 minute . No three 5-minute episode blood flow stoppage perform . - Standard MRI scan exercise limb determine muscle volume . - Brachial artery reactivity test measure blood vessel function : Before exercise stress testing , subject lie stretcher brachial artery ( artery forearm ) image use noninvasive ultrasound method . Artery size blood flow velocity measure inflate blood pressure cuff forearm . Vessel size flow velocity measurement repeat 15 minute administration nitroglycerin tongue . - Oral glucose tolerance test test diabetes : To assess sugar metabolism , subject drink sugar solution . Blood sample collect drink solution 1 2 hour drink solution . - Muscle biopsy ( optional accord subject preference ) : Subjects may give small amount sedation procedure . A small area skin leg muscle numb small amount muscle tissue surgically remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We previously report TP53 ( encode p53 protein ) , one frequently mutate gene human cancer , dose dependently modulate balance utilization oxidative glycolytic pathway energy generation human colon cancer cell mouse liver mitochondrion . Though morphologically similar wild-type littermates , mouse deficient p53 display gene dose-dependent decrease aerobic exercise capacity , imply p53 function beyond well characterize cell cycle activity . These current finding broad implication field range cancer age research cardiovascular physiology . In Li-Fraumeni familial cancer syndrome ( LFS ) , affected individual harbor germline mutation TP53 , hence heterozygous reduce wild-type p53 activity . We hypothesize heterozygous individual display alteration aerobic capacity metabolism previously unappreciated . This IRB proposal translate experimental observation human subject collaboration extramural group study rare familial syndrome . The result may help clarify mutation p53 gene common cancer potentially confer metabolic advantage tumorigenesis , may also give u opportunity understand fundamental regulatory mechanism cellular energy generation relevant process .</detailed_description>
