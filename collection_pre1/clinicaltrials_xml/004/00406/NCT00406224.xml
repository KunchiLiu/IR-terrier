	<brief_summary>Background It recently show diffuse luminance flicker increase retinal optic nerve head blood flow . This indicate neuro-vascular couple neural activity blood flow exist describe previously brain . Although lot mediator NO , pO2 , pCO2 , H+ K+ propose , mechanism couple still matter controversy . However , show animal experiment , increase blood flow , evoke diffuse luminance flicker stimulation parallel decrease pO2 tissue . Thus , study set investigate flicker light induced increase blood flow elevate blood pO2 . Study rationale The motive investigation retinal blood flow regulation enhance understand couple mechanism increase neural activity blood flow retina order gain new insight pathophysiology several eye disease associate ocular vascular disorder Study objective To test hypothesis whether oxygen breathe influence flicker light induce change optic nerve head blood flow</brief_summary>
