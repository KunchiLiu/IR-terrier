	<brief_summary>Subjects intensively-treated type 1 diabetes glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 7.0 % -10.0 % 3 age group ( &gt; 25 , 15-24 , 8-14 ) randomize continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) group control group . The primary outcome change HbA1c 26 week . A parallel randomized trial conduct second cohort HbA1c &lt; 7.0 % follow identical protocol first cohort HbA1c &gt; =7.0 % . The &gt; =7.0 % trial specifically design statistically power compare separately impact continuous versus standard intensive glucose monitoring three age group . Both trial use standardized treatment algorithms equivalent frequent contact subject CGM control group . After completion 26-week trial , CGM group continue use CGM another 26 week evaluate whether beneficial effect see first 6 month sustain longer-term use less intensive contact control group initiate CGM use less intensive contact first month provide initiation CGM use CGM group randomize trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitors ( RT-CGM ) Management Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . On day enrollment , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level obtain , psychosocial questionnaire complete , instruction give use real time continuous glucose monitoring device ( RT-CGM ) . The study personnel supervise subject parent insert RT-CGM sensor clinic instruct subject parent insert second sensor home need . To obtain baseline assessment glycemic control variability , RT-CGM use first week blind subject able view data sensor . The subject instruct complete least four glucose measurement day use study home glucose meter ( HGM ) need calibrate RT-CGM . 2 . The subject return second visit 10 day enrollment visit . - Subjects compliant use RT-CGM HGM randomize one two treatment group : RT-CGM Group Control Group . - Compliance define use RT-CGM least 6 7 day prior second visit , least 96 hour RT-CGM glucose value obtain least 24 hour hour 10 p.m. 6 a.m. , use HGM test least 3 time day prior second visit . - Subjects compliant give another opportunity complete baseline requirement discretion investigator . - For RT-CGM Group , RT-CGM , HGM , pump data ( subject use insulin pump ) review change make diabetes management need . Subjects/parents taught use protocol-developed instruction change diabetes management use real time base RT-CGM HGM data . Instructions download RT-CGM HGM provide subject home computer . - For Control Group , HGM test strip provide . The HGM pump data ( subject use insulin pump ) review change make diabetes management need . The blinded RT-CGM data download review study personnel end first 6 month study . Subjects parent taught use protocol-developed instruction make change diabetes management base HGM data . 3 . Both group follow-up visit 1 , 4 , 8 , 13 , 19 , 26 week ( +/- 1 week ) plus one phone contact visit ( include one phone contact second visit one week visit ) review diabetes management . - Both group download device data weekly basis ( subject computer ) . Subjects email access instruct email download data clinical center prior phone contact . - For group , visit , HGM pump ( subject use insulin pump ) download RT-CGM Group , RT-CGM download . 4 . In 13th 26th week , Control Group use blind RT-CGM one week . The RT-CGM Group continue use unblinded RT-CGM . The Control Group return blind RT-CGM clinic week . The data review personnel involve care subject determine additional blind sensor data need . The blinded data review study personnel management decision end first 6 month study . 5 . Following 26-week visit : - Subjects RT-CGM Group continue use RT-CGM . - Subjects Control Group provide RT-CGM sensor week blind use visit 1 week 4 week , phone contact first third week . - Both group visit 13 week 26 week ( study time 9 12 month ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes use daily insulin therapy least one year The diagnosis type 1 diabetes base investigator 's judgment ; C peptide level antibody determination need . Age &gt; 8 year Glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 7.0 % 10.0 % primary cohort &lt; 7.0 % secondary cohort The DCA2000 comparable point care device use assess eligibility . Insulin regimen involve either use insulin pump multiple daily injection insulin ( least 3 shot per day ) stable last two month , plan switch modality insulin administration next 6 month ( e.g. , injection user switch pump , pump user switching injection , addition Lantus ( Glargine ) insulin ) Subjects use premixed fix dos insulin time enrollment eligible Subject ( parent/guardian child ) understand study protocol agree comply Subjects &gt; 9 year old primary care giver ( i.e. , parent guardian subject minor ) comprehend write English Spanish This requirement due fact questionnaire use outcome measure validate version language . Spanishspeaking subject enrol RTCGM device function Spanish User Guide Spanish available . No expectation subject move area clinical center next year , unless move area serve another study center . Informed Consent Form sign subject ( parent/guardian subject minor , subject sign Child Assent Form ) The presence significant medical disorder use medication oral/inhaled glucocorticoid judgment investigator affect wear sensor completion aspect protocol . The presence follow disease : Asthma treat systemic inhaled corticosteroid last 6 month Cystic fibrosis Adequately treat thyroid disease celiac disease exclude subject enrollment Inpatient psychiatric treatment past 6 month ( subject minor , either subject subject 's primary care giver ) . Home use RTCGM past 6 month Use CGMS GlucoWatch exclude subject enrollment Participation intervention study ( include psychological study ) past 6 week . Another member household participate study . For female , pregnant intend become pregnant next year Pregnancy exclusion uncertainty lag interstitial fluid glucose blood glucose pregnancy , might affect accuracy sensor . Subjects become pregnant study discontinue study .</criteria>
