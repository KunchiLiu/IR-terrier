	<detailed_description>Primary objective ass overall response rate ( ORR ) induction therapy docetaxel combination CDDP cetuximab patient NSCLC stage IB , II , IIIa . ORR determine percentage patient achieve objective response rate ( CR + PR ) accord RECIST guideline . Secondary objective - To evaluate pathological response determine histological work surgical specimen accord TNM stage . - To evaluate metabolic response determine PET analysis . - To assess overall survival ( OS ) ( median survival time percentage 1-year survival ) . OS define time elapsed date patient inclusion record date death . - To characterize quantify toxic effect schedule therapy . Safety profile tolerability assess record adverse event , clinically significant laboratory abnormality , physical examination vital sign . Toxicities evaluate accord NCI-CTC Toxicity Criteria adverse event report NCI-CTC grade mild , moderate , severe life-threatening . All patient receive scheduled therapy include overall toxicity analysis . - To evaluate immunological response determine regulatory T-cells immune activation marker , define chemoresistance pharmacogenomic testing .</detailed_description>
