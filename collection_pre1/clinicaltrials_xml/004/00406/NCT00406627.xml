	<brief_summary>The purpose study check blood sample lymphatic filariasis determine whether recent Program Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis successful control lymphatic filariasis area Egypt . Volunteers participate health assessment program carry Ain Shams University approve Egyptian Ministry Health Population . This program include brief interview laboratory test detect worm parasites participant ' blood . Volunteers family member find worm blood refer treatment . This study provide early detection parasitic infection referral prompt treatment order prevent spread infection others . Approximately 23,500 people , 6 year age old , participate per year . Study participant include people live area Egypt know filariasis parasite . Volunteers participate 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study detect lymphatic filariasis blood sample determine whether recently conclude Program Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis successful control lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) area Egypt . The Research Training Center Vectors Diseases ( RTC ) Ain Shams University Cairo , Egypt , central site data management laboratory study . Field sit ( locality village school survey ) 44 village small town 27 Districts 7 governorates Nile river delta Giza . These locality choose base inclusion Egyptian National Program Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( PELF ) . Other locality choose proximity know endemic locality past history filariasis endemicity . The primary study objective conduct population-based field study address key question face late stage program elimination lymphatic filariasis ( ELF ) . The investigator test hypothesis filariasis eliminate Egypt 5 round Mass Drug Administration ( MDA ) attempt answer follow question : ( 1 ) Has LF eliminate locality include Egyptian National ELF Program ? The investigator study 44 locality ( 22 per year alternate year ) . ( 2 ) What characteristics endemic community affect likelihood success failure ELF program ? The goal identify key characteristic share locality achieve elimination . ( 3 ) Are significant foci infection locality include Egyptian National PELF ? The investigator screen 20 new locality per year first 3 year project . The investigator conduct cohort study natural history filarial antigenemia treat population . This study test two hypothesis : ( ) Filarial antigenemia without microfilaremia follow completion MDA program diethylcarbamazine albendazole little parasitological significance . That say , people unlikely develop level microfilaremia support filariasis transmission . ( b ) Following completion MDA program , filarial antigen level amicrofilaremic subject decline time disappear without treatment . The investigator ass value advance diagnostic method detect foci continue transmission early detection resurgent transmission . The duration study 5 year , approximately 23,500 people participate per year . Most participant study cross-sectional survey . The study population include female male 6 year age live area Egypt know endemic suspected endemic bancroftian filariasis . Subject selection base health status . A subset people , approximately 120 , follow cohort study 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Gender , minority child inclusion : Males female include populationbased village study without regard race ethnic group . There reason exclude pregnant woman populationbased study . There reason exclude child village/town study , include . Younger child study school survey ( large number per locality ) important sentinel ongoing filariasis transmission . Eligibility cohort study : Subjects household survey positive immunochromotography test , filarial antigen test , negative microfilaria thick blood smear take diethylcarbamazine albendazole Egyptian Program Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis invite participate study . Subjects must resident locality meet Basic Elimination criterion ( community microfilaria prevalence thick smear less 1 % antigen prevalence rate le 2 % ) . Consenting subject screen test sample venous blood collect 9 p.m. microfilaremia membrane filtration perform ELISA quantitate filarial antigenemia serum . Eligible subject microfilaremia smear antigen level &gt; 20 ng/ml . Exclusion child less 10 year age community study filarial antigen microfilaria prevalence justify prevalence rate parameter exceedingly low young child low transmission area like Egypt .</criteria>
