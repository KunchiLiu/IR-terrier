	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether breathe helium-hyperoxia exercise pulmonary rehabilitation program improve exercise tolerance health relate quality life patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Breathing Helium-Hyperoxia During Pulmonary Rehabilitation Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well accept exercise training part comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program improve exercise tolerance , functional status quality life patient COPD . It feasible patient able perform great volume intensity exercise rehabilitation outcomes program would improve . Recent research demonstrate breathe helium-hyperoxic gas mixture significantly reduce dynamic hyperinflation dyspnea exercise patient COPD increase exercise tolerance great extent breathing room air nitrogen-based hyperoxic gas . If patient COPD breathe helium-hyperoxic gas exercise able tolerate great intensity exercise maintain similar level exertional symptom observe low exercise intensity breathe room air . As result patient randomize helium-hyperoxia condition obtain great improvement exercise tolerance receive usual care ( i.e . breathing room air ) Comparisons : Standard pulmonary rehabilitation patient COPD receive either usual care ( air breathe ) helium-hyperoxia ( 40 % O2 , 60 % Helium ) .</detailed_description>
