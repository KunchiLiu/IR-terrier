	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial RAD001 Plus Docetaxel Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm , Phase I/II trial determine safety RAD001 combination docetaxel compare efficacy RAD001 plus docetaxel versus publish Phase II III report docetaxel alone patient recurrent NSCLC . New agent regimens urgently need lung cancer treatment . With development novel agent small molecule design curtail aggressive aspect disease , progress realize . However , much effort insight require real gain make . We propose study mTOR axis , know abnormal non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , translate knowledge therapeutic adjustment lead meaningful advance lung cancer treatment . Approximately 58 patient participate Emory Winship Cancer Institute Emory Crawford W. Long Hospital Atlanta , Georgia .</detailed_description>
