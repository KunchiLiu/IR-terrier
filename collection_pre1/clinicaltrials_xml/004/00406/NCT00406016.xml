	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Acute spinal cord injury paraplegic tetraplegic patient confirm classification ASIA A ( C5 ≤ lesion ≤ T12 ; 414 day postinjury ( i.e . study drug treatment must begin 414 day post injury ) paraplegic patient tetraplegic patient require artificial respiration time treatment initiation within 414 day time interval . In tetraplegic patient still require artificial respiration 414 day time interval treatment initiate 60 day postinjury soon patient wean respiratory machine . ) Tetraplegic patient initially diagnose ASIA A ( neurologically complete lesion ) screening turn ASIA B ( neurologically incomplete lesion ) baseline . Hemodynamically stable ( baseline ) . For female patient child bear potential , write agreement abstain intercourse first 12 week study subsequent use doublebarrier local contraception , i.e . intrauterine device plus condom , spermicidal gel plus condom one year post study drug treatment . Patients must receive documented counsel contraceptive measure . For Cohort 5 : Acute spinal cord injury tetraplegic patient confirm classification ASIA A : Cervical lesion ( C5 ≤ lesion ≤ T1 ) . 428 day postinjury ( i.e . study drug treatment must begin 428 day post injury ) . Tetraplegic patient allow start treatment either require mechanical ventilation completely depend mechanical ventilation show degree spontaneous ventilation . Only modes ventilation patient must initiate breath allow ( e.g . continuous positive airway pressure [ CPAP ] ) . Exclusion criteria Complete anatomical transection confirm MRI trauma cause ballistic injury directly penetrate spinal cord include gunshot knife wound . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) indicate complete obstruction intrathecal space . Presence one following : multiple spinal cord lesion cauda equina damage major brachial lumbar plexus damage/trauma significant head trauma ( e.g . cortical damage/lesion ) , injury , opinion investigator , sufficient interfere assessment spinal cord function otherwise compromise validity patient 's data . Other significant preexist current systemic disease lung , liver ( exception : history uncomplicated Hepatitis A ) , gastrointestinal , cardiac , immunodeficiency ( include human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] ) kidney disease ; active malignancy condition determine history laboratory investigation could cause neurological deficit include syphilis , myelopathy , clinically relevant polyneuropathy , etc . History meningitis , meningoencephalitis , epilepsy lifethreatening allergic immunemediated reaction . History current autoimmune disease acute episode GuillainBarre syndrome . Patients uncontrolled bleeding diathesis and/or concomitant treatment coumarin anticoagulant . Presence unstable medical psychiatric condition ( define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental DisordersIV [ DSMIV ] ) could reasonably expect subject patient unwarranted risk participation study result significant deterioration patient 's clinical course . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/ml ) . Hemoglobin level 8.0 g/dl and/or patient require great 10 ( ten ) blood transfusion since acute injury Patients concomitant treatment Metamizole Screening end Follow Up phase Mechanical ventilation allow patient Cohort 5 , patient must depend completely ventilation show degree spontaneous ventilation . Only modes ventilation patient must initiate breath allow ( e.g . continuous positive airway pressure [ CPAP ] ) . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
