	<detailed_description>Participants &amp; Setting Participants study 30 consecutive child refer Thoughtful House treatment autism relate developmental disorder . Participants may may also concurrently receive intensive behavioral intervention service Center Autism Related Disorders . All therapy behavioral test session occur premise Thoughtful House . Inclusion Criteria The follow criterion consider inclusionary : - Male female child 2-10 year diagnose autism , PDD , Aspergers - No anticipated change treatment study duration ( e.g. , diet , nutrient ) - No additional biomedical treatment start 6 week prior enrollment - No change dietary management 3 month prior enrollment - Access Thoughtful House daily basis , necessary study participation In addition , child participant must : - Ambulatory require minimum support walking , per parent - Able sit still 5 minute longer preferred toy item , per parent - Adequate vision hearing purpose test administration , per parent - Adequate arm-hand-finger coordination ( i.e. , able point ) learn cognitive task use outcome measurement , per parent - Stable controlled medical disorder - Under care caregiver willing participate attend regularly schedule appointment complete necessary measure Exclusion criteria The follow criterion consider exclusionary : Current otitis medium Sinus infection Asthma Pulmonary cyst Emphysema Upper respiratory infection Severe claustrophobia , intolerance chamber History Seizures Unstable/uncontrolled disorder kind Design Ten set multiple baseline measurement group , 3 participant ( n=30 ) use evaluate effect HBOT behavioral measure adaptive ( mean length utterance , MLU ) , aberrant , stereotype behavior . The first participant multiple baseline receive session behavioral measure minimum one week prior implementation HBOT . Subsequent participant receive HBOT effect observe ( determined via visual inspection statistical analysis data ) prior participant prior participant receive 40 HBOT treatment , whatever occur first . Subsequent receive 40 HBOT treatment , participant give break HBOT least one week , time schedule behavioral measure remain . If proficiency behavioral measure decrease HBOT terminate one week , HBOT may reinitiated per discretion physician parent . HBOT Systematic Desensitization Because child autism often tolerate change environment , anticipate difficulty initial treatment compliance child . In clinical setting , child become acquainted mask machine , introduce enclose oxygen chamber HBOT begin prescribed pressure . Below general desensitization procedures participant : 1 . The child introduce mask therapist model wear 2 . The child require hold un-strapped mask loosely his/her face he/she breathe hold mask place minute 3 . The child require strap mask minute , gradual increase 30+ minute 4 . The child seat upright chamber mask HBOT machine minute , gradual increase 30+ minute 5 . The child lie chamber mask HBOT machine low pressure set minute , gradual increase 30+ minute 6 . The child mask strap lie , HBOT run hour For child exhibit severe noncompliance HBOT procedure , relaxation training listening preferred music prior HBOT procedure may use . In order minimize influence learn attention parents/therapists HBOT/placebo session , child view developmentally-appropriate DVD ( e.g. , Disney movie ) HBOT session minimize confound effect may occur activity . The view DVDs continue throughout 80 session follow-up . Procedures Data collect accord follow schedule : prior treatment , follow 5 , 15 , 25 , 40 HBOT treatment , well post-treatment 1 3-month follow-up . Behavioral Measures Participants receive intensive behavioral intervention service course study continuous measure many aspect performance record daily , part behavioral intervention service . Such measure customize behavioral education need child , likely include , minimum : 1 ) measure adaptive behavior ( e.g. , language ) ; 2 ) measure aberrant behavior ( e.g. , tantrum , etc . ) ; 3 ) stereotype behavior . All continuous measure observe throughout course participant 's involvement study . However , consideration particular continuous measure part current study would require inter-observer agreement data collect measure minimum 25 % observe data . That , second , independent observer must record data behavioral clinical measure include study . Participants receive intensive behavioral intervention service receive behavioral measure describe . Participants receive intensive behavioral intervention service course study receive measure describe , well clinical behavioral measure adequate inter-observer agreement data collect . Repeated acquisition task A defining feature autism global impairment one 's ability learn . Repeated acquisition task commonly use drug behavioral pharmacology study assess effect drug ability individual learn , , efficiency individual 's behavior bring new form stimulus control . Repeated acquisition task typically involve participant learn respond new sequence position session . For example , four lever button present participant must press four button particular sequence order earn reinforcement . However , correct sequence different every session , typically one session conduct daily , sequence responding require earn reinforcement different day . The performance participant analyze number way include percent correct entire session , total number response number error make 80 % correct respond reach . The complexity task adjust vary either two parameter : 1 ) number response position present ( e.g. , number button present ) , 2 ) number response sequence require reinforcement . For example , ten button could present participant require press one particular button ten order get reinforcement , versus press sequence ten involve button , versus two button present , etc . The standard degree complexity behavioral pharmacology research four response option present require participant respond four particular order earn reinforcement . Delayed match sample An additional cognitive process might interest evaluate HBOT short-term memory . A common behavioral measure short-term memory delay matching-to-sample ( DMTS ) procedure . In procedure , sample stimulus present removed delay occur removal sample stimulus presentation two comparison stimulus . The participant earn reinforcement choose correct comparison stimulus . The delay removal sample stimulus presentation comparison stimuli vary zero conceivable duration , typically exceed 60 second . The relation sample stimulus correct comparison stimulus vary order alter difficulty task . For example , sample stimulus correct comparison stimulus may identical , often refer `` identity matching . '' This easy form DMTS . Alternatively , sample stimulus may relate correct comparison stimulus abstract dimension . For example , sample stimulus may write word car correct comparison stimulus might bicycle , gorilla fork distracters . Sessions conduct fixed delay delay systematically increase session order identify threshold participant longer able respond correctly . For example , first trial , delay may zero second delay may increase 4 second subsequent trial , contingent correct responsse previous trial . The data analyze determine long delay participant consistently correct 80 % accuracy . This threshold consider measure participant 's short term memory time session . Standardized Measures In addition direct measure behavior describe , standardized intelligence adaptive assessment conduct prior initiation HBOT . These include : ADI/ADOS WPPSI-III ( 2-6 year ) /WASI ( 6+ year ) Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale ( VABS ) Subjective Questionnaires Aberrant Behavior Checklist Clinical Global Impression ATEC Selected section APEQ BRIEF Parenting Stress Index Repetitive Behavior Scale A side effect questionnaire Thoughtful House Caregiver diary Laboratory &amp; Physiological Measures Full physical exam ( weight , height , vital signs-temperature ) Otoscopic examination prior enrollment study STATISTICAL DESIGN/ANALYSIS The primary measure consist change rate percentage change pre post HBOT adaptive , aberrant , stereotype behavior . ADVERSE EFFECTS AND MANAGEMENT : 2 commonly encountered adverse reaction ear pain sinus pressure . Ear Pain : This minimize ameliorate working pressure equalization technique across tympanic membrane . These technique include : Yawning Drinking water/juice Val Salva ( Plugging nose mouth , blow air ear ) Jaw thrust swallow Bending head side yawning/swallowing . The technician slow rate pressurization allow adequate time pressure equalization occur Sinus pressure : ameliorate slow rate pressurization depressurization . Also , administration 0.5 % Neosynephrine intranasally pseudoephedrine use . Should serious adverse event occur , form SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FORM fill report IRB office within 5 business day write summary circumstance surround adverse reaction submit IRB review next schedule IRB meeting . Minor reaction , ear pain sinus pressure manage documented physician .</detailed_description>
