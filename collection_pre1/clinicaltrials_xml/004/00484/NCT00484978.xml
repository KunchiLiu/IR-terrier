	<brief_summary>Brain metastasis ( BM ) common intracranial tumor adult source common neurological complication systemic cancer . Surgery radiation therapy important component management BM goal prolong survival improve quality life . Whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) show increase local distant control without surgical resection . However , patient develop new recurrent BM WBRT undergo resection leave without adjuvant therapy option . Local recurrence particular patient single metastasis effect survival quality life . In individual case option additional radiotherapy suggest applied . We seek evaluate addition stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) boost resection cavity adjuvant salvage procedure among patient , undergo resection BM previously receive WBRT decline WBRT . Goal show superior local brain control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Purpose Treatment strategy recurrent brain metastasis Limited clinical data support intervention recurrent BM WBRT , re-operation SRS , depend previous treatment ( 6 , 45 , 48 ) . Two retrospective analysis look total 130 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient recurrent BM resection ( 6 , 45 ) . , Recurrence happen original site approximately two/thirds patient sit remainder ; Re-resection significant effect prolong survival compare patient undergo ( p=0.001 ) . A small subgroup patient underwent third resection median survival 42 month . A recent study look resection BM previously treat SRS ( 48 ) . Sixty-one patient 1-3 previously treat BM recur underwent resection . Major neurological morbidity occur 2 % mortality observe . A multivariate analysis show high RPA class , focal treatment ( surgery SRS ) , treatment new additional lesion significantly affect survival . Re-operation previously focally treated BM provide long-term control positive impact survival . Additionally , confirm pathological diagnosis recurrent lesion SRS important , radiation necrosis occur 2.3 % -8.6 % patient , condition require different treatment approach recurrent metastasis ( 5 , 10 , 14 ) . Surgery radiation therapy important component complex treatment BM prolong survival improve quality life . Patients , develop brain metastasis WBRT remain limited option . A resection diminish local disease significantly ; however adjuvant radiation might increase control rate . We plan evaluate addition stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) boost resection cavity adjuvant salvage procedure patient , underwent resection BM previously receive WBRT decline WBRT . Study Design The study design observe patient feasibility , efficacy toxicity : Patient Enrollment Informed Consent obtain eligibility screening assess use Inclusion/ Exclusion criterion . A patient appear meet ALL eligibility requirement ask participate study . Variables Measured The primary end point evaluate follow obtain follow neuro-imaging ( contrast Brain CT MRI ) . The secondary end point measure follow : - Evaluation CT MRI neuro-radiologist . â€“ Individual response : comparison pre-treatment follow-up MRI perform 2-3 month interval accord clinical indication . - Side effect follow treatment , well self report ( otherwise obtain ) absence side effect . Pre-Procedure Screening process : Patients know systemic malignancy , underwent surgical resection brain metastasis fulfill eligibility criterion specify study ( see inclusion/exclusion criterion ) Imaging : All patient undergo contrast CT MRI brain image preparation treatment . Neurological Baseline Assessment : A standard neurological baseline examination shall take place . The neurological examination include follow : - Cognitive function ( Mini Mental Status ) - Cranial nerve - Motor Strength - Deep tendon reflex - Plantar response - Sensory - Coordination/Gait</detailed_description>
