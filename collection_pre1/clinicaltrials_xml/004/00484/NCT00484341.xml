	<brief_title>Phase II Study NGR-hTNF Combination With Doxorubicin Patients Affected Soft Tissue Sarcomas .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considering safety/toxicity profile NGR-hTNF characterize mild-to-moderate constitutional symptom give either every three week weekly low ( 0.8 µg/m^2 ) high dose ( 45 µg/m^2 ) ; reversibility adverse event generally occur infusion time ; absence overlap toxicity chemotherapeutic agent ; safety preliminary antitumor activity observe phase Ib trial doxorubicin , seem justified evaluate randomize 4-arm phase II trial preliminary antitumor activity two dose NGR-hTNF ( 0.8 µg/m^2 45 µg/m^2 ) administer weekly either alone combination standard dose doxorubicin ( 60 mg/m^2 every three week ) .</detailed_description>
