	<brief_title>Specialized Addiction Treatment Versus Treatment Usual Young Patients With Cannabis Abuse Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF THE TRIAL : The randomized clinical trial aim examine effect specialize treatment cannabis abuse amongst young people psychosis . Specialized addiction treatment compare treatment usual . Treatment usual non-specialized , non-manualized treatment . In order examine effect two treatment , patient randomize either specialized addiction treatment treatment usual . INTRODUCTION : Clinically , consensus exist fact cannabis cause psychotic symptom distinguish schizophrenia , abuse cannabis among patient psychosis maintain worsen psychotic symptom . This also find scientific study [ Linszen et al. , 1994 ] . Several study show use cannabis increase risk development schizophrenia-like symptom , especially young men dispose develop psychosis [ Zammit et al. , 2002 ; Arseneault et al. , 2002 ; Arseneault et al. , 2004 ; Henquet et al. , 2005 ] ) . Comorbid schizophrenia substance abuse ( dual-diagnosis ) associate several review lack compliance treatment . A systematic examination hospitalize patient schizophrenia find lack compliance treatment relate substance abuse lack insight ( Kamali et al. , 2001 ) . A follow-up study patient schizophrenia cannabis abuse find significantly rehospitalizations , bad psychosocial functioning , high level think disorder pronounce paranoia compare non-abusing patient schizophrenia ( Caspari , 1999 ) . In `` Reference Programme Schizophrenia '' [ Sekretariatet reference programmer , 2004 ] , Danish National Board Health make follow recommendation : `` Since patient schizophrenia concomitant cannabis abuse poorer prognosis , treatment system therefore develop treatment method effective alleviate cannabis abuse . '' Evidence effect treatment cannabis abuse : There little evidence concern treatment cannabis abuse , literature suggest treat use method effective type abuse . Several randomized trial show effect cognitive behavioural therapy [ Waldron Kaminer , 2004 ] ; however , treatment programme combine motivational interviewing , family involvement , cognitive behavioural treatment seem effective [ McRae et al. , 2003 ; Carroll , 2005 ] . Evidence effect treatment patient dual diagnosis : A Cochrane review 2002 conclude insufficient evidence exist show intensive treatment method superior others [ Ley et al. , 2000 ] . It recommend offer treatment separately part treatment program [ Linszen et al. , 1994b ; Drake et al. , 2004 ] . A randomized trial show combination cognitive behavioural therapy , motivational interviewing , family involvement significant positive effect level functioning , psychotic symptom , duration period without abuse , compare regular treatment [ Barrowclough et al. , 2001 ] . Two review conclude positive evidence integrate treatment motivational interview , cognitive behavioural therapy ( individual group-based ) , 12-step treatment , harm-reduction approach [ Ziedonis , 2004 ; Rachbeisel et al. , 1999 ] . Evidence effect group-based intervention cannabis abuse : There evidence show group-based intervention superior individual treatment ( McRoberts et al. , 1998 ; Greene , 2002 ) . Treatment group less expensive . In literature review , Weiss et al . conclude specialized group therapy reinforce effect exist treatment ( Weiss et al. , 1992 ) . A study 1999 robustly implement manualized behavioural group intervention show significant positive effect symptom , level functioning , low cost supportive service [ Jerrell Ridgely , 1999 ] . There evidence efficacy stepwise phase-specific treatment successively base engagement , motivation , cop symptom , prevent relapse [ Drake et al. , 2004 ] . Conclusion : A review literature show lack randomized trial ensure treatment patient dual diagnosis evidence-based . This trial assist solve problem building best practice . Therefore , plan trial group-based , combined treatment , motivational interviewing , psychoeducation , cognitive behavioural therapy , social skill train compare treatment usual . INTERVENTIONS : 1 . The experimental intervention : Cannabis Psychosis ( CapOpus ) - specialize treatment programme : The patient connect case manager offer education supervision one two addiction consultant employ trial-project . The addiction consultant directly indirectly involve treatment patient . During month prior group intervention , one addiction consultant contact patient twice week . A meeting also hold patient 's family fortnightly contact case manager establish . During three month group intervention , one addiction consultant weekly individual contact patient two meeting family . In addition , patient follow weekly group intervention ( 12 meeting 1½ hour ) fortnightly consultative contact case manager . During two month follow group intervention , addiction consultant weekly contact patient family invite meeting . The addiction consultant contact patient 's case manager every three week . For purpose create alliance motivation , treatment start motivational interview [ Miller , 1983 ; Miller Rollnick , 1991 ] . There good evidence efficacy motivational interview short-term treatment [ Hettema et al. , 2005 ; Burke et al. , 2003 ] . The patient formulate individual goal treatment offer group intervention . The group consist 6 8 patient , addiction consultant trainer . Each group run three month weekly session last 1½ hour . The group conduct fixed time weekday structure agenda meeting . The group intervention follow two month individual weekly meeting patient continue . The two addiction consultant offer consultative assistance patient 's case manager , also possibility involve consultant directly treatment patient . The entire specialized treatment programme , addiction consultant involve , amount six month . A manualized treatment programme base Australian EPPIC manual [ Hinton et al. , 2002 ] especially develop first-episode psychotic patient cannabis abuse use . This method well describe incorporate method high degree evidence . Motivational interviewing analysis advantage drawback continue abuse use . Instruction give cop skill relation crave situation usually trigger abuse , develop personal strategy avoid handle situation . Furthermore , strategy handle withdrawal symptom prevent relapse facilitate . General cop skill introduce , handle unpleasant emotion , stress-management , social skill training , relaxation technique . An element contingency management introduce enhance motivation participation group intervention . In Cochrane Review 2006 , Denis et al . conclude contingency management treatment may enhance outcome combine CBT motivational enhancement [ Denis et al. , 2006 ] Contingency management CapOpus trial solely connect positive reinforcement attendance group intervention . It connection whether use cannabis decrease . Patients offer participation free excursion , cinema visit etc . company one addiction consultant . Also , sandwich serve conjunction group session . An important part `` Cannabis Psychosis '' understand help patient understand mechanisms prevent abstain cannabis . The overall target harm reduction , method prove effective several study [ Ziedonis , 2004b ; Rachbeisel et al. , 1999 ] . The treatment base patient ' goal tackle cannabis abuse . The treatment structure around circle change [ Prochaska , 1991 ; Prochaska Diclemente , 1992 ] . This describes change behaviour process run phase pre-contemplation , contemplation , preparation , action , maintenance . Relapse consider integrated part process , phase must repeat . Pedagogy group intervention take account psychotic patient often subnormal cognitive functioning . It therefore important structure session predictable over-learning encompass . This do use agenda session : - Round - happen past week . - Repetition last session . - Homework assignment session . - Talk/psychoeducation ( new topic session ) . - Discussion participant ' experience topic . - New homework assignment . - Finishing round - evaluation . The active participation patient facilitated discussion role-playing homework session . To increase motivation , teach make relevant relation life patient individual goal treatment . The overall principle describe manual , session leave room adaptation patient ' wish stage circle change . Therapist role directive direct , non-confronting non-critical . Emphasis empathy positive reinforcement , problem solve generalization patient ' daily life . The atmosphere sought relaxed room humour . For conclude part group intervention , patient former cannabis abuse involve role model . Methods treatment part cognitive therapeutical framework , use psychoeducation , cognitive behavioural therapy , social skill train . The aim ensure patient gain insight inappropriate pattern thought action develop cop strategy . This facilitate : Exploration patient 's reason use cannabis connection symptomatology . Mapping advantages/disadvantages cannabis use cessation use . Warning sign craving/relapse . Problem-solving skill cop skill symptom . Use behavioural chain analysis ( Mørch Rosenberg , 2005 ) . Work negative automatic thought alternative thought . Social skill train ( e.g . refuse drug , solve conflict , engage new contact ) . Facilitating daily recreational activity . Relapse prevention develop crisis plan . Structure modules group-intervention : The structure intervention base stage Prochaska Diclemente 's model change ( circle change ) . The model base view patient often fluctuate different stage undergo relapse able reach final stage , mark last change . In order support group patient process change lifestyle , therapist must able identify current stage group/patient . Thus , intervention aim specifically , either orient towards motivation enhance advisory technique , change focus , e.g . explore reason change make plan change . The purpose motivate patient move stage ; therefore , model also call `` motivational cycle '' `` circle change '' . In way , session group adapt participant ' motivational level stage change . Sessions pre-contemplation stage : Psychoeducation : Knowledge psychotic symptom . Knowledge psychosis-inducing effect cannabis . Knowledge risk harm cause cannabis use . Knowledge abstinence symptom follow cannabis use ( Budney et al. , 1999 ) . Knowledge effect decrease use ( harm reduction ) . Mapping individual pattern use , focus disadvantage cannabis use trigger crave use . This do use registration chart . Contemplation stage : Exploration pro con cannabis use cessation use . This used aim replace advantage cannabis use intervention . Exploration connection cannabis abuse symptomology . Ambivalence resistance address accept viewpoint . Preparation stage : Individual goal-setting focus disadvantage cannabis use . Exploration connection cannabis use symptomatology . Development symptom-coping skill alternative cop strategy . This facilitated exploration pros/cons , behavioural chain analysis exploration negative automatic thought action relation cannabis abuse . Social skill train enhance ability refuse drug , solve conflict , initiate contact non-users . Introduction problem-solving model ( Mørch Rosenberg , 2005 ) . Action stage : Problem solving , cop strategy test . Mapping warn sign relapse trigger cannabis use . Individual crisis plan relation relapse worsening symptom . Maintenance stage : Development new skill habit daily life . Support ( cooperation case manager ) maintain active life focus activity daily life ( ADL ) , exercise work/education/recreational activity . Widening personal network non-cannabis user . Training general cop skill social skill train , handle unpleasant emotion , stress management , relaxation technique . Strategies relapse prevention cop strategy crave test daily life . Involvement patient former cannabis abuse consultant role model . Relapse : De-dramatizing normalization focus learn relapse . Support order re-engage stage change , focus patient 's coping strategy . Programme adherence : To ensure programme adherence , number contact patient , patient 's family , case manager register six-month intervention period . Forms registration programme adherence implement individual group session . Registration form also use ensure planned content group intervention sufficiently implement . These form anonymized review research assistant . The addiction consultant supervise external supervisor expertise cannabis abuse , motivational interviewing , cognitive behavioural therapy . 2 . The control intervention : non-specialized individual treatment : The non-specialized treatment programme carry staff OPUS ( treatment young people psychosis Copenhagen ) , Assertive Community Treatment Community Mental Health Centres . Thus , control intervention identical treatment ordinarily offer patient-group . The frequency contact patient may vary . There standardized manual treatment . The treatment approach supportive condemnatory . It important advise patient alternative coping strategy encourage every small reduction abuse . RESEARCH PLAN : A research assistant responsible conduct interviews time inclusion trial , six month , ten month later . Thereby , first follow-up interview hold specialized CapOpus treatment conclude . The second follow-up interview hold four month specialize treatment end . The assessment instrument use effect measure validate psychometric scale , research assistant certify use . Referred patient assess research assistant ensure meet criterion inclusion . Randomization blinding : Randomization one two treatment arm perform baseline assessment . Firstly , randomization stratify severity cannabis abuse measure TLFB , create two sub-strata ; one patient use cannabis less 15 day precede 30 day period , one patient use cannabis 15 day . This do avoid risk heavy-users cannabis overrepresented either treatment group . Similarly , randomization stratify base referrer - OPUS , CMHC , ACT , unlikely patient three referrers comparable regard psychotic symptom level functioning . The Copenhagen Trial Unit ( CTU ) perform centralize randomization , CTU know block size use randomize . A research assistant provide information patient CTU conduct baseline assessment . The CTU performs randomization procedure base computer-generated allocation sequence , communicates allocate treatment CapOpus consultant responsible CapOpus experimental intervention . If patient allocate CapOpus intervention , consultant contact patient . Regardless allocation , consultant also contact patient 's case manager , treatment usual intervention commence . This procedure ensure research assistant , subsequent patient assessment , blind allocate intervention . Blinding maintain end trial . Patients instructed reveal detail may cause research assistant deduce treatment receiving . At two follow-up assessment point , research assistant register guess treatment patient receiving . When trial finish , inter-rater reliability actual treatment research assistant 's guess estimate use Cohen 's kappa coefficient ass whether blind successful . Effect measurement : The following effect measurement use baseline , six month ten month : 1 . Severity abuse . Assessment number day cannabis abuse last month Time Line Follow-Back ( Sobell Sobell , 1992 ) . This effect measurement best measure effect trial aim influence ; namely whether number day cannabis use reduce . Information supply patient cannabis use validate result blood analysis . Blood test take six-month ten-month follow-up interview . If comparison result blood analysis patient 's self-report Time Line Follow-Back indicate patient 's report reliable , Time Line Follow-Back use measure effect . 2 . Influence severity substance use , include prescribed medication , establishment severity consequence cannabis use , assess use section 11 ( use alcohol ) 12 ( use psychoactive substance alcohol ) SCAN interview ( Schedules Clinical Assessment Neuropsychiatry ) . [ Wing et al. , 1990 ] 3 . Psychosis symptom assess use The positive negative syndrome scale ( PANSS ) schizophrenia . [ Kay et al. , 1987 ] A psychiatrist , blind patient ' allocation , rate sample videotape interview measure reliability rating interview 4 . Cognitive function : Danish Adult Reading Test ( DART ) use estimate prepsychotic IQ . Speed information processing assess BACS ' symbol cod Trailmaking A. Attention/vigilance assess CBT test . Working memory assess Trailmaking B . Memory verbal learning assess Hopkins Verbal Learning Test . Executive function assessed NAB Mazes . Social functioning ( major life area ; community , social , civic life ) assess WHODASII . 5 . Quality life assess MANSA EQ-5D . 6 . User satisfaction assess Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [ Larsen et al. , 1979 ] 7 . Expenses experimental intervention ( CapOpus ) control intervention measure examine number outpatient treatment bed day treatment group . Follow-up plan undertaken six month , patient specialize CapOpus treatment finish intervention time . Follow-up ten month choose , allow four-month follow-up period end specialize treatment . Sample size power calculation : Our power sample size calculation base t-test five few day cannabis use one treatment , standard deviation five . This mean 22 patient allocate two treatment . In OPUS-study , receive standard treatment substance abuse baseline drop-out rate 37 % one year . Generalizing present study , ignore likelihood small drop-out intervention arm , require least 35 patient allocate intervention . However , aim include 60 70 patient group order able measure difference secondary outcome . In group intervention , maximum inclusion 32 patient annually ( 4x8 ) ; therefore , necessary project continue several year order recruit necessary number patient . The necessary number patient ensure launch project cooperation three OPUS team Copenhagen , Assertive Community Treatment , Community Mental Health Centres , treatment facility cannabis abuser Copenhagen Frederiksberg . Statistics : The main null-hypothesis test difference two treatment arm regard decrease cannabis use . All randomized patient analyze , include stop receiving treatment , accord intent-to-treat principle . Continuous outcome measure , include primary outcome reduction day cannabis abuse , analyze use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) mix model repeat measurement . This include interaction analysis time type treatment , order evaluate effect time . Binary outcome measure analyze use multivariate logistic regression model . The subgroup patient complete entire experimental treatment compare randomized trial . Sensitivity analyse carried evaluate effect treatment patient inaccessible follow-up . This conducted multiple imputation methodology . Publication : The result trial publish national international journal . Authorship determine agreement cooperation entire project . The publication publicize accord Consort Vancouver guideline publication randomize trial . Ethical consideration : The participant invite letter assessment research assistant , present trial patient , orally write . The research interview take place Bispebjerg Hospital , OPUS , patient 's home , wherever may possible . In oral presentation , state explicitly participation voluntary dangerous , patient withdraw inform consent time without consequence treatment . Oral write informed consent obtain .
