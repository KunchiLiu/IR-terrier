	<detailed_description>Charcot Marie Tooth disease ( CMT ) , inherited peripheral neuropathy , among frequent heritable disorder , affect approximately 1 2500 people . The frequent genetic form CMT CMT1A . CMT1A cause 1.4 Mb duplication within chromosome 17p11.2 region contain PMP22 gene . Most subject CMT1A `` typical '' phenotype characterize onset childhood early adulthood , distal weakness , sensory loss , foot deformity absent reflex . How increased expression PMP22 cause disability unknown currently investigate animal tissue culture system . In study , researcher evaluate whether ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) , administer orally , slow clinical progression CMT1A affect PMP22 mRNA level myelinated peripheral nerve fiber obtain biopsy glabrous skin .</detailed_description>
