	<brief_summary>Lumbar zygapophysial ( facet ) joint pain common cause low back pain . Radiofrequency ( RF ) denervation effective low risk treatment chronic low back pain suspect facet joint etiology . Blocks medial branch innervate joint commonly use localize pain make diagnosis facet joint pain . There currently standard number diagnostic block : zero , one , two block utilized . Considering high false positive false negative rate block , cost : benefit ratio question . No study date examine practice diagnostic medial branch block RF denervation . The purpose study determine optimal number block radiofrequency denervation . Three group patient study . In group I , patient undergo RF denervation base history physical exam alone . In group II , patient undergo RF denervation base positive response single diagnostic block local anesthetic . In group III , patient undergo RF treatment positive screening block positive confirmatory block .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lumbar zygapophysial ( facet ) joint recognize one common cause chronic low back pain estimate prevalence among patient LBP range 15 % 40 % . Radiofrequency ( RF ) denervation facet joint utilized effective treatment chronic pain attribute joint . Blocks medial branch innervate joint commonly use localize pain make diagnosis lumbar zygapophysial ( l-z ) joint pain . However , consider high false-positive rate block ( 25-40 % ) , false-negative rate ( 8-10 % ) , number block necessary make diagnosis treatment , cost-effectiveness performing block benefit expose patient additional risk question . The risk RF denervation low ( equivalent perform diagnostic block ) , question whether diagnostic facet block perform RF lesioning . The purpose study determine optimal number diagnostic block perform radiofrequency denervation patient chronic low back pain suspect facet joint etiology . In prospective randomized study , recruit 150 patient suspect chronic ( l-z ) joint pain without neurological symptom undergo one three treatment modality . In group I , 50 patient undergo RF denervation base history physical exam alone ( advocate recent review article ) . In group II , 50 patient receive single diagnostic block 0.5 % bupivacaine . Those obtain great 50 % pain reduction undergo RF denervation . In group III , 50 patient receive block either 2 % lidocaine 0.5 % bupivacaine . Those patient obtain great 50 % pain relief first block receive second block local anesthetic . Patients obtain great 50 % pain relief second block undergo RF . Patients group obtain less 50 % pain relief block exit study .</detailed_description>
