	<brief_summary>Women newly diagnose breast cancer anticipate breast-conserving surgery enrol study undergo high-resolution positron emission mammographic ( PEM ) image contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) breast ( ) . The purpose study determine change surgical management result PEM MRI image compare conventional image determine change appropriate histopathology gold standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Role Positron Emission Mammography Pre-surgical Planning Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast compression and/or immobilization positron emission tomographic ( PET ) image call positron emission mammography , `` PEM , '' device use perform scan call PEM Scanner . This protocol design prospective multi-center clinical trial evaluate role high resolution PEM , use combination radiotracer 2- [ F-18 ] - fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , pre-surgical planning woman newly diagnose breast cancer consider candidate breast conserve surgery ( i.e . lumpectomy ) full workup mammography , clinical breast exam , additional US would normally perform . Participants undergo contrast enhance MRI PEM image . In order control potential bias interpretation second examination ( i.e . PEM MRI ) , order interpretation examination randomly assign study entry.The primary objective study determine change surgical management result PEM MRI , separately conjunction conventional image determine whether change appropriate ( i.e . excise malignancy ) inappropriate ( e.g . wider excision mastectomy prove benign disease ) .</detailed_description>
