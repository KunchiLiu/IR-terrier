	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis disabling , chronic respiratory condition significantly impact quality life patient present chronic sputum production respiratory infection . The occurrence pulmonary infection strong predictor morbidity mortality group people primary goal treatment prevent infection cause presence sputum lung . Physiotherapy major aspect management focus teach appropriate airway clearance technique . Traditionally , physiotherapy management sputum retention due bronchiectasis include active cycle breathing technique demonstrate enhance airway clearance . For patient , treatment adequate . The use nebulised hypertonic saline use patient cystic fibrosis demonstrate improve sputum removal lung function . The aim project determine long term effect daily inhalation hypertonic saline respiratory infection , quality life , lung function hospital admission patient non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis . Hypertonic saline show beneficial treatment patient group , ' long term effect study . Participants randomise two group - receive hypertonic saline ( 6 % ) receive isotonic saline ( 0.9 % ) - blind treatment receive . They give nebuliser equipment instruct inhale medication . Objective measure take blind assessor commencement project 3 month , 6 month 12 month post commencement .</detailed_description>
