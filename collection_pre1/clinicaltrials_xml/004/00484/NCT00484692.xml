	<brief_summary>Background Smokers often reject drug smoke cessation aid . Nonpharmacological intervention notoriously under-evaluated . Methods We conduct randomized clinical trial compare medication , i.e. , sustained-release bupropion ( Zyban® ; 413 subject ) , time trial efficacious pharmacological smoking cessation aid , ultrashort psychotherapeutic intervention , Psychodynamic Model Training® ( 366 subject ) , manual-based psychodynamically orient 1 ½ day autosuggestion training . Outcome criterion 12-month self-reported continuous abstinence confirm urine cotinine level level detection ( 13 ng/ml ) , independent analysis , exhale carbon monoxide 10 ppm less interview conduct 3 , 6 , 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Ultrashort Psychotherapy v Sustained-Release Bupropion Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design This randomized clinical trial design compare efficacy safety manual-based 1.5-day psychotherapeutic intervention , i.e. , Psychodynamic Model Training® , medication , i.e. , sustained-release bupropion ( Zyban® ) , smoke cessation aid . In order render data comparable previously obtain bupropion data , bupropion treatment regimen study protocol closely follow Jorenby et al . 1999 . ( 3 ) As improvement previous protocol ( 3-5 ) , nonsmoking status verify determination exhale carbon monoxide ( CO ) level also tandem mass spectrometric ( LC/MS/MS ) analysis urine cotinine ( 6 ; 7 ) , marker high sensitivity CO. ( 8 ) Subjects , screen , inclusion exclusion criterion , randomization Female male smoker recruit July 2005 December 2005 announcement local medium ( press , local radio station ) newsletter ( http : //www.stgkk.at/mediaDB/104832.PDF ) governmental Styrian Regional Health Care System ( Steiermaerkische Gebietskrankenkasse , STGKK ) , sponsor present study . Interested smoker first screen telephone interview schedule study intake interview . The first subject enrol July 2005 , follow-up complete January 2007 . Of total 951 person screen , 790 meet screen criterion enrol randomized one two treatment accord randomization list care steer committee Medical University Innsbruck . Great care take preserve treatment allocation concealment : Only subject give his/her write consent , seal envelope contain treatment allocation break interviewer present subject . The study protocol register European Medicines Agency ( emea.europa.eu ; EudraCT-Nr . 2005-006189-32 ) approve local governmental review board . The study conduct compliance ethical principle Declaration Helsinki ( www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.html ; accessibility verify May 16 , 2007 ) standard good clinical practice develop International Conference Harmonization ( www.ich.org/cache/compo/276-254-1.html ; accessibility verify May 16 , 2007 . ) Inclusion criterion age least 18 year , cigarette consumption least 15 cigarette per day last 3 month , willingness contribute EUR 70 treatment cost , regardless treatment modality . Exclusion criterion , assess study-site physician , psychiatric diagnosis except nicotine caffeine dependence , current psychopharmacological treatment , know hypersensitivity bupropion , epilepsy , liver cirrhosis , brain tumor , pregnancy ( verified immunological test intake interview 3 week first day first menses occur within treatment ) , lactation , serious unstable cardiac , renal , hypertensive , pulmonary , endocrine , neurologic disorder , ulcer , dermatologic disorder , current use smoking cessation treatment , regular use noncigarette tobacco product . After induction first 620 subject , become apparent subject randomize bupropion group drop immediately learn treatment allocation . To compensate high rejecter rate bupropion group , remain 170 subject randomize bupropion v psychotherapy ratio 2:1 . Seven 420 subject randomly allocate bupropion group 4 370 psychotherapy group find meet exclusion criterion study ’ physician randomization ( bupropion : bulimia , 3 case major depression , 2 case antidepressant medication , anticoagulant medication ; psychotherapy : 4 case previously undisclosed psychiatric diagnosis ) exclude treatment start . Therefore , final intention-to-treat ( ITT ) sample consist 413 subject bupropion 366 subject psychotherapy group . Treatments The treatment period sustained-release bupropion ( Zyban® ) group nine week ( 3 ) , follow protocol give Zyban® ’ product information provide manufacturer ( GlaxoSmithKline , Vienna , Austria ) : After initial medical consultation , dose run-up period 1 week final 150 mg sustained-release bupropion twice daily day 7 , target quit date set second week , usually day 8 . Subjects return second visit , schedule day 26 33 treatment , study ’ physicians medical checkup receive second 60-tablet package Zyban® . Failure show second medical checkup consider treatment failure . Psychodynamic Model Training® manual ( 9 ) -based psychodynamically orient ultrashort psychotherapeutic intervention , consist brief psychoeducation initial training autosuggestion technique teach single 1.5-day program ( day 1 , 0900-2000 h ; day 2 , 0900 – 1300 h ) . Subjects , approximately 30 per group , introduce five guided imagery scenario aim strengthen follow psychotherapeutically define aspect function : ( 1 ) self-worth , self-determination , self-assurance ; ( 2 ) self-acceptance ; ( 3 ) health , vitality , relaxation , awareness bodily function ; ( 4 ) creativity , self-worth , remuneration emotional reward one ’ work ; ( 5 ) ability sustain intimate personal relationship . Follow-up period Subjects either group contact telephone schedule follow-up assessment study physician ’ office Institute Clinical Psychology , Psychotherapy , Health Promontion , Graz , end month 3 , 6 , 12 , present appointment within 36 h telephone call order facilitate detection smoking . During assessment , subject ask non/smoking status , breathalyzer CO level determine associate study ’ sponsor , STGKK , provide urine sample cotinine analysis . Family member randomly select subject also receive telephone call staff member STGKK confirm non/smoking status . No relapse-prevention counseling administer follow-up period . Assessments At baseline , demographic data , medical smoke history obtain , vital sign exhale CO level determine . The Beck Depression Inventory ( 10 ) use assess depressive symptom ( score 0 9 consider normal , score 10 18 indicated mild-to-moderate depression , score 19 29 indicated moderate-to-severe derpession , score 30 63 indicate severe depression ) . The Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire ( 11 ; 12 ) use quantify severity nicotine dependence ( score 0 11 , high score indicate severe dependence ) . A separate questionnaire contain portion Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual version 4 ( DSMIV ) ( 13 ) concern substance dependence disorder . During follow-up interview , CO level determine expire air breathalyzer ( piCOsmokerlyzer® , www.bedfont.com ) . Urine sample obtain quantified cotinine , major metabolite nicotine urine elimination half-life around 20 h , ( 7 ) HPLC couple tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) previously describe . ( 14 ) The cotinine ( mass transition 177 &gt; 80 m/z ) standard curve ( internal standard , 50 ng/ml d3-methadone ) essentially linear high concentration test , i.e. , 2000 ng/ml ( quadratic equation fit , weight 1/x , r &gt; 0.99 ) . The level detection ( LOD ) 13 ng/ml signal/noise ratio 2/1 ) . The level quantification ( LOQ ) actual urine sample study 30 ng/ml . Measures outcome The primary outcome criterion biochemically/pharmacologically-confirmed 12-month continuous abstinence evidence self-reports nonsmoking status interview ( i.e. , 3 , 6 , 12 month ) . Self-reports nonsmoker status confirm urine cotinine level level detection ( 13 ng/mL signal/noise-ratio 2/1 LC/MS/MS analysis ) 3 follow-up interview . Subjects bupropion group report abstinence target quit date onwards , subject psychotherapy group report abstinence end 1.5-day program onwards . Subjects self-reported nonsmoker status urine sample could collect 3 follow-up time point refuse provide urine sample 3 follow-up time point consider smoker . In order well compare data present study previously publish bupropion data , ( 3 ; 4 ) nonsmoker status confirm , independently urine cotinine analysis , exhale carbon monoxide ( CO ) level 10 part per million ( ppm ) 3 follow-up interview , follow nonsmoker criterion Jorenby coworkers low-frequency follow-up . ( 3 ; 4 ) The secondary outcome point prevalence self-reported abstinence confirm urine cotinine level level detection follow-up time point . Outcome criterion assess ITT- completer-sample . Statistical analysis The sample size approximately 380 subject per group determine , standard condition regard power ( 80 % ) two-sided alpha level ( 0.05 ) , follow difference two treatment group may detect : continuous abstinence rate 17 % one group vs 10 % 23 % vs 15 % 29 % vs 20 % . Baseline comparison two treatment group perform chi-square test categorical data , Student ’ t-test normally distribute Mann-Whitney U-test non-normally distributed numerical variable . Differences two group regard primary ( 12-month continuous abstinence rate ) secondary ( point prevalence abstinence ) outcome criterion , TEAE rate , rejecter rate analyse mean chi-square test ( two-sided ) . In order quantify difference two group , Odds Ratio ( OR ) , Relative Benefit ( RB ; analogy Relative Risk ) , Number Needed Treat ( NNT ) determine . Agreement two detection method ( cotinine level , CO level ) evaluate kappa coefficient , significant difference continuous abstinence rate two detection method determine mean McNemar test . All analysis perform certified statistician use SPSS® software ( www.spss.com ) . Measures variance either standard deviation ( S.D . ) treatment group ’ baseline characteristic 95 % confidence interval OR , RB , NNT .</detailed_description>
