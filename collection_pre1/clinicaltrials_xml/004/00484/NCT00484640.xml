	<brief_summary>The study goal conduct randomize control trial compare safety accuracy dose base clinical information include clinical reason take coumadin , age , gender , body surface area , medical condition may dose estimate dose calculator adjusts factor affect coumadin dose variability include genotype gene important Coumadin metabolism response . The hypothesis test trial state : compare patient manage best practice standard-of-care coumadin dose regimen , patient randomize coumadin dose base genetically program metabolic capacity know clinical environmental factor affect dose : 1 ) show reduce risk adverse event ( use surrogate measure event ) ; 2 ) rapidly achieve Coumadin dosing .</brief_summary>
