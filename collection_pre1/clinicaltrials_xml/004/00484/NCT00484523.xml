	<brief_summary>MRI powerful image tool use precise study brain morphology ( morphometric study , tissue study , study connectivity ) . Isotopic examination Single Photon Emission Tomography ( SPET ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) use explore cerebral perfusion metabolism ( 99mTc- ECD SPET 18FDG PET ) , well dopaminergic neurotransmission ( 123I FP-CIT SPET , DATSCAN® ) . These examination routinely contribute clinical diagnosis surveillance many neurological pathology ( dementia , Parkinson syndromes , epilepsy , concussion , vascular pathology , brain tumor , etc. ) . As result original morphological functional information provide , examination increasingly include clinical research protocols involve brain . The absolute relative quantification anomaly observe , however , obtain comparison database normal subject . The creation databases currently limit cost strictly single center nature ( physical characteristic center 's MRI , gamma camera PET scanner ) . The aim multidisciplinary study constitute standardize database multimode neural imaging ( SPET , PET MRI ) able objectively quantify anomaly observe patient , scale group individual , diagnosis surveillance neurological disease . Participants pay €350 . 60 healthy subject 20 80 year age ( 30 men 30 woman ) recruit 3 year . 4 examination program 2 day ( one cerebral MRI , 18FDG PET , one 99mTc-ECD SPET one DATSCAN® ) . The strictly single center character study explain variability physical characteristic image equipment use ( MRI , SPET PET scan ) inherent center .</brief_summary>
