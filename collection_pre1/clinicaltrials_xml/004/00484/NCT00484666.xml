	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Weekly Docetaxel Topotecan Patients With Platinum-Resistant , Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year 28,000 woman diagnose epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) . Over 70 % woman present advanced ( stage III , IV ) disease . The current treatment newly diagnose advanced EOC involve cytoreductive surgery follow chemotherapy . The standard chemotherapy primary set combination taxane ; either paclitaxel docetaxel platinum agent ; either cisplatin carboplatin . Although high initial response see primary therapy , recur . Salvage chemotherapy thus become mainstay treatment many patient disease . The goal salvage therapy maximize tumor response maintain quality life minimal toxicity . As consequence , number agent studied recurrent set significant antitumor activity . Two novel agent , topotecan docetaxel basis phase I , II study . Patients group prognostic category base response primary therapy . Those persistent disease recurrence within 6 month treatment deem platinum resistant achieve great 6 month progression free interval deem platinum sensitive . This distinction important platinum sensitive improve overall survival high response rate salvage chemotherapy . The magnitude response increase increase progression free interval . The response patient reintroduce either platinum paclitaxel establish . Thigpen et . al . show 44 % overall response rate ( ORR ) paclitaxel infuse 24 hour 16 patient platinum free interval great equal 6 month . Kavanagh et . al . demonstrate 21 % partial response rate ( PR ) reintroduction carboplatin taxane treatment 26 patient 12-month platinum-free intraval follow platinum-refractory ovarian cancer . Topotecan show similar activity paclitaxel second line therapy non-cross resistance . Topotecan usually administer daily infusion 30 minute dose 1.5 mg/m2/d x 5 consecutive day every 21 day . In effort decrease toxicity maintain response rate , weekly schedule topotecan explore . Homesley et . al . conducted phase I trial single agent weekly topotecan evaluate dosage 1.5 6 mg/m2/wk . The recommended phase II dosage weekly topotecan determine 4 mg/m2/wk . Dose limit toxicity consist 70 non-hematologic event 32 35 evaluable patient , primarily consist grade 1 2 chronic fatigue ( 16 % ) gastrointestinal ( nausea vomit [ 23 % ] ) majority ( 80 % ) grade 1 severity . Dose limit myelotoxicity thrombocytopenia issue weekly dosage evaluate trial . Morris colleague Wayne State University currently study weekly topotecan platinum sensitive patient report 40 % partial response rate 35 % stable disease . Myelotoxicity infrequent include grade 3 4 neutropenia 1.1 % grade 3 anemia 1.8 % . Nonhematologic toxicity include grade 3 fatigue 17 % patient . Abu-Rustum et . al . conducted phase I trial weekly paclitaxel ( 60 -100 mg/m2 1-hour ) platinum resistant patient ( n = 18 patient , recommend phase II dose 80 mg/mg/wk ) . Dose limit toxicity define two patient treatment delay grade 3 toxicity dose level . Treatment delay 2 3 patient 100 mg/m2 dose level due ANC &lt; 1500 . In addition review Memorial Sloan Kettering 's previous data weekly paclitaxel ( 60 100 mg/m2/wk ) platinum resistant patient find overall response rate ( either document tumor shrinkage decrease serum CA-125 level ) 28 % ( ORR 13 45 patient ) . In follow phase II trial , Markman et . al . report 25 % objective response rate 13 51 platinum resistant patient ( 4 decrease CA-125 9 50 % reduction tumor volume ) . Only 1 % ( 13 887 dosage ) require dose modification due toxicity weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2/wk . Weekly paclitaxel active second-line regimen generally well tolerate . In advanced , platinum-refractory ovarian cancer , docetaxel administer every 3 week demonstrate substantial single-agent efficacy response rate range 24 % 40 % overall survival 8 10.4 month . Neutropenia predominant Grade 3 /4 toxicity , follow fluid retention , hypersensitivity reaction diarrhea . The combination docetaxel carboplatin study first-line therapy treatment epithelial ovarian cancer . A phase II study Markman et.al . utilized docetaxel 60 mg/m2 plus carboplatin AUC 6 every 3 week demonstrate overall response rate 81 % . The common hematologic toxicity Grade 4 neutropenia ( 64 % ) , neutropenic fever observe 6 % patient . The common non-hematologic toxicity mild hypersensitivity reaction ( 34 % ) prevent patient complete planned therapy . Preliminary result recently report randomized phase III trial compare docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2/1 hr infusion ) paclitaxel ( 175 mg/m2/3 hr infusion ) combination carboplatin ( AUC 5 calculate 51Cr-EDTA secretion ) every 3 week first-line chemotherapy follow surgery Stage Ic-IV ovarian cancer . Both combination demonstrate high overall response rate 65 % 62 % , respectively , estimate 1 year disease free survival approximately 60 % treatment group . With regard toxicity , occurrence Grade 2-4 sensory neurotoxicity significantly increase patient receive paclitaxel ( 30 % ) compare docetaxel ( 11 % ; p &lt; .001 ) account majority toxicity relate treatment withdrawal paclitaxel group . The common severe side effect myelosuppression Grade 3 4 neutropenia occur 84 % patient treat paclitaxel 94 % patient treat docetaxel ( p &lt; .001 ) . Febrile neutropenia note 10 % patient treat docetaxel , compare 2 % patient treat paclitaxel ( p &lt; .001 ) . However , difference septic mortality two treatment arm . In order decrease incidence hematological toxicity associate docetaxel administer every three week , clinician explore use docetaxel weekly schedule . There numerous publish report examine role weekly docetaxel ( single agent combination chemotherapy regimens ) wide range solid tumor include breast , NSCLC , prostate ovarian . Weekly administration docetaxel result substantial clinical activity , well tolerate result decreased incidence hematologic toxicity ( grade 3/4 neutropenia leukopenia report ≤16 % patient ; grade 3/4 anemia thrombocytopenia ≤13 % ≤3 % patient , respectively . Acute toxicity uncommon , peripheral neuropathy . Prolonged treatment weekly docetaxel result chronic toxicity , include asthenia ( fatigue ) , edema , tear ( excessive lacrimation epiphora ) , nail change . Chronic toxicity prominent docetaxel administer continuous weekly basis , i.e. , without break . Toxicities appear delayed onset avoid provide treatment break . The current strategy treat weekly 2 3 week every 21-day cycle weekly 3 4 week every 28-day cycle . The reduced incidence myelosuppression may enhance feasibility tolerability weekly docetaxel-containing combination regimen . Burris colleague enrol 36 patient phase I study weekly docetaxel ( 20 , 25 , 30 mg/m2/wk ) weekly topotecan ( 2.0 , 3.0 , 3.5 4 mg/m2/wk ) solid tumor . The combination weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 3 mg/m2/wk day 1 , 8 15 every 28 day result dose-limiting toxicity dose reduction treatment omission warrant cycle 1 therapy . Non-hematologic toxicity consist grade 1 2 nausea , vomit , fatigue weakness . Dose-limiting toxicity document weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 4 mg/m2/wk two patient experience day 15 dose omission ( one patient platelets 53 K ANC 500 one patient platelets 27 K previously treat oxaliplatin . Eleven patient treated date weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 3.5 mg/m2/wk . Two patient non-evaluable , one due rapidly progressive disease one due noncompliance . Of nine evaluable patient , five patient experience dose-limiting toxicity follow , ( 1 ) cycle 1 day 15 ( C1D15 ) hold due platelet 33K heavily pretreated patient , include previous oxaliplatin , ( 2 ) C1D15 dose decrease due grade 3 diarrhea , ( 3 ) C1D8 hold due grade 3-4 nausea vomiting ( may disease relate ) , ( 4 ) C1D15 hold due platelet 49 K ( 74 yo , heavily pretreated include previous XRT ) , ( 5 ) C1D15 hold due platelet 43K decline creatinine clearance 43 ml/min ( 3 prior regimen , include XRT , PS 2 history thrombocytopenia ) . One additional patient plan complete dose level , provide 10 evaluable patient . Of 36 patient receive 76 cycle therapy , myelosuppression brief reversible febrile neutropenia . Per verbal communication Dr. Burris , recommend phase II dose docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 3.5 mg/m2/wk day 1 , 8 15 every 28 day minimally pretreated patient . Given result data goal increase response rate platinum resistant recurrent EOC patient would seem prudent evaluate safety efficacy weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus weekly topotecan 3.5 mg/m2/wk via phase II trial . Results trial important expand current knowledge base utilizing weekly scheduling chemotherapeutic agent regard toxicity response rate platinum resistant EOC .</detailed_description>
