	<brief_summary>Some Matrix Metalloproteases , proteases degrade extracellular matrix , play relevant role structure stability atherosclerotic plaque . Atherosclerotic plaque trigger acute coronary syndrome show increased expression MMP-1 , MMP-3 MMP-9 . Regulation MMPs plaid genetic polymorphism , G+/G- –1563 MMP-1 , 4A/5A- –1612 MMP-3 , microsatellite ( 13-27 CA repeat around –90 ) MMP-9 . It conceivable polymorphisms correlate clinical outcome acute coronary syndrome , particularly without ST segment Elevation ( NSTEACS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTEACS ) syndrome encompass spectrum clinical manifestation ischemic heart disease acute myocardial infarction . It represent important cause morbidity hospitalization western country : incidence estimate around 2/1000 subjects/year 10 % patient acute coronary syndrome develop acute myocardial infarction within 6 month . Another reason concern patient require invasive treatment , usually PTCA CABG . ACS encompass feature inflammatory thrombotic disease ; abnormality could critical evolution complication acute coronary syndrome . Many inflammatory coagulation indicator investigate , although critical factor responsible complication NSTEACS remain elusive . Matrix remodel consequent erosion fissuration unstable plaque suppose key step development acute coronary syndrome . Neutral matrix metalloproteinases 1 , 3 9 demonstrate actively produce atherosclerotic tissue , compare unaffected artery . Mechanisms responsible increase expression might relate inflammation , also genetic regulation could account increased expression lead different clinical outcome syndrome . Genetic polymorphism describe three MMPs involve ACS . MMP-1 insertion G position create ets bind site induces eight time increase synthesis rate . For MMP-3 ( stromelysin ) polymorphism , deletion A ( adenosine ) position -1171 double transcription activity recently associate acute myocardial infarction progression coronary stenosis . In MMP-9 complex polymorphism involve microsatellite ( AC ) repeat position –90 –131 . The mechanism lead increase MMP-9 expression probably related transition Z-DNA within microsatellite , ease transcription . In vitro study show longer tandem repeat sequence , high transcription . No study metalloproteinase polymorphism NSTEACS carry , far . This study plan assess patient admit hospital NSTEACS could associate different hospital clinical outcome accord genetic polymorphism protease .</detailed_description>
