	<brief_summary>African Americans high prevalence vascular disease Caucasians . Vascular disease lead heart attack , stroke even amputation . Insulin , hormone secrete pancreas , affect glucose fat metabolism also vascular disease . Impairment insulin ability remove glucose circulation know insulin resistance . To overcome insulin resistance pancreas secrete extra insulin . These high level insulin affect circulate triglyceride level promote production triglyceride liver interfere clearance triglyceride circulation . Triglyceride turn contributes development vascular disease cause inflammation hypercoagulability . Surprisingly African Americans insulin resistant high rate vascular disease Caucasians low triglyceride level . Because high rate vascular disease African Americans , aim determine adverse effect triglyceride occur low level African Americans Caucasians . To achieve goal determine difference effect meal triglyceride level vascular function representative cohort African American Caucasian woman . For study enroll 96 woman ( 48 African American 48 Caucasian woman ) . We recruit woman ethnic difference triglyceride even great woman men . We enrol woman age 18 65 year . The study involve several outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center . The first visit screen determine eligibility . At second visit test measure insulin resistance perform . This test call frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test . The third visit test meal . Before 2 , 4 6 hour meal , blood drawn vascular function measure . Vascular function determine take blood pressure measure blood flow arm ultrasound . It possible individual difference diet could affect result vascular study day test meal . Therefore 7 day prior test meal , NIH Clinical Center provide participant meal form either trays meal box . These meal consistent typical American diet 33 % fat , 15 % protein 52 % carbohydrate . In design meal , dietician take account individual food preference . This study perform collaboration Harvard School Public Health , University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Indiana University .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : African American Women : Individuals consider African American selfidentify African American born United States . Further must describe parent African American . Caucasian Women : Individuals consider Caucasian selfidentify Caucasian . Healthy Volunteers : The potential enrollee must self identify normal volunteer confirm screening visit normal complete blood count , glucose , BUN creatinine , liver thyroid panel . Age 18 65 year : This age range choose TG level across lifespan early adulthood postmenopausal status . Weare use 65 year age conventional upper limit . In addition , 65 year age use age category cutoff National Health Nutrition Examination Surveys . Our goal detect ethnic difference pathway allow vascular disease develop . Enrolling woman age 18 65 year , maximize ability detect difference mechanism action truly secondary ethnicity . Weight le 136 kg ( 300 lb ) : This weight restriction necessitate limitation DXA scanner . The DXA platform accommodate subject weigh 136 kg . BMI 20 45 kg/m2 : Women ethnic group recruit across BMI nonobese obese category . Therefore enroll approximately equal number woman ethnic group BMI categories BMI 20 30 kg/m ( 2 ) BMI 30 45 kg/m ( 2 ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Refusal agree use barrier contraception : The DXA scan CT scan perform participant pregnant . In addition , TG level directly affect pregnancy . Even though perform pregnancy test within 7 day visit , also require subject agree abstinence barrier contraception throughout study . Medications affect parameter investigation : Examples include corticosteroid , oral contraceptive , hypoglycemic ( oral injection ) , hypolipidemic , antihypertensive antipsychotic agent . Oral contraceptive , particular , exclusion criterion estrogen component oral contraceptive increase TG level would therefore obscure effect test meal TG level . Medical Conditions affect parameter investigation : Examples include diabetes , thyroid disease , liver disease , pancreatitis , nephrotic syndrome . Hispanics : The relationship TG insulin resistance Hispanic White woman midway African American Caucasian woman . Therefore initial study able determine maximum ethnic difference relationship TG insulin resistance , enroll protocol study woman selfidentify African American Caucasian enroll woman selfidentify Hispanic .</criteria>
