	<brief_title>Surveillance Hospitalizations Due Rotavirus Infections Among Children From Israel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Vaccination rotavirus appropriate mean prevention control rotavirus infection . Israel highly endemic diarrheal disease limit data exist burden &amp; epidemiology rotavirus diarrheal disease . Such data essential assess relevance potential future vaccination rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis Israel . Objectives 1 . To determine burden characteristic rotavirus-associated hospitalization among child five year age northern Israel 2 . To identify potential risk factor rotavirus infection associate hospitalization among Jewish Arab child younger five year age . Methods : Study design : A two-year prospective study nest case control study carry Study population : About 45000 child age less five year , reside catchment area three pediatric ward sentinel hospital ( Laniado - Netanya , Carmel - Haifa &amp; Hillel Yaffe -Hadera ) daily surveillance hospitalization due rotavirus diarrheal diseases two year . The catchment area 3 hospital good representation Jewish Arab pediatric population . During study period expect 400 hospitalization due diarrheal diseases 80 hospitalization due rotavirus gastroenteritis annually , three hospital ( i.e . 480 case rotavirus- diarrheal disease two year study ) . 100 subject hospitalize rotavirus associate diarrhea 100 control match age , gender origin recruit nested case-control study . Collection data : Questionnaires fill demographic characteristic patient data clinical manifestation diarrheal episode lead hospitalization . Stool specimens systematically collect child hospitalize diarrheal disease examine rotavirus bacterial protozoan enteropathogens . Positive sample rotavirus test G P genotype . For nested case control study additional data obtain parent ' interview variable : parent ' education , parent ' age , parent ' occupation , . sibling , age sibling , breastfeed etc . identify potential risk factor rotavirus diarrhea necessitating hospitalization . Data analysis : Methods descriptive statistic / epidemiology apply determine characteristic burden rotavirus-associated hospitalization ( distribution diarrhea associate hospitalization etiology , rate rotavirus diarrheal disease Jewish Arab child , age specific rate rotavirus infection , percentage hospitalization due rotavirus diarrhea month , etc . For nested case control study , univariate analysis first perform use Student test continuous variable chi square test categorical variable study statistical significance predictive factor rotavirus diarrheal disease necessitate hospitalization .
