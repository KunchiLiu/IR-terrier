	<brief_summary>The aim present study evaluate new technique prevention sternal wound infection consist local application collagen-gentamicin addition routine i.v . antibiotic prophylaxis . The technique evaluate previous randomise study . The aim present study evaluate technique introduce clinical practise monitor bacterial antibiotic susceptibility verify suggest reduction sternal wound infection still exit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Collagen-Gentamicin Extra Fixation Sternum Prevention Sternal Wound Infection Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new technique prevention sternal wound infection cardiac surgery study . Local application directly surgical wound aminoglycoside antibiotic ( gentamicin ) bound collagen reduce incidence wound infection 50 % previous prospective randomise trial . As technique introduce clinical practise two question need monitor : - Are sign change bacteria cause wound infection shift time towards gentamicin resistant agent ? - Is effect prophylaxis still comparable see previous study ? Furthermore , result previous study indicate effect local antibiotic better combine extra rigid sternal wound infection , define least one extra steel wire sternal fixation . The study conduct two Swedish cardiothoracic surgery center first study . There thus two objective study : first analyze microbiologic finding sternal wound infection occur , secondly monitor incidence sternal wound infection ( especially deep infection ) local collagen-gentamicin prophylaxis use daily routine combination specific surgical technique optimization strength sternal fixation .</detailed_description>
