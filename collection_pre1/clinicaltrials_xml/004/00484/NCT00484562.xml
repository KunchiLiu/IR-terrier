	<brief_summary>Objectives : The objective study determine difference exist vary mode portable oxygen delivery system include liquid oxygen , portable concentrator , portable device fill home concentrator , medical grade compress oxygen ( either M6 size D size cylinder ) . Hypothesis : Patients prescribe LTOT show similar physiologic response exercise use differ modality portable oxygen delivery system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Comparing Different Modalities Oxygen Delivery During Assessment Functional Exercise Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 900,000 individual currently utilize Long Term Oxygen Therapy ( LTOT ) country . LTOT administer use one combination three basic delivery system : compress gas cylinder , liquid oxygen system , oxygen concentrator . Each base oxygen delivery system unique advantage disadvantage regard operation , function , cost . The majority LTOT user require oxygen ambulation . Within home accomplish 20-50-foot extension tubing . Extending length tube allows user ( patient ) ambulate extend distance base oxygen delivery system . Limitations course , distance , become entangle tube conducive short trip mailbox . Ambulation outside home , however , require use `` portable oxygen system '' . Put simplistically , portable oxygen system miniaturize version base system . Here also , particular delivery system inherent advantage disadvantage . An important development portable oxygen system advent pulse-dose technology . Pulse-dose technology allow gaseous liquid portable system conserve oxygen delivery . During inspiratory phase breathe solenoid control valve open `` dose '' bolus gas flow cannula . Unlike traditional continuous-flow cannula , oxygen deliver inspiratory expiratory cycle , pulse-dose technology delivers oxygen inspiratory phase breathing . Oxygen flow deliver inspiration result less total oxygen consumption . This in-turn allow relatively small portable oxygen system efficient last longer . Such efficiency important patient , also Home Medical Equipment ( HME ) provider . Portable oxygen system incorporate pulse-dose technology typically decrease home visit require deliver replenish patient 's oxygen supply . One portable technology allow patient refill small oxygen device home , use electricity ( battery AC ) functionality , provide economic hardship patient prescribe LTOT . Another portable technology actual portable oxygen concentrator lightweight operate electricity well . By comparison , oxygen deliver patient HME provider , either cylinder liquid form , indirect product liquefaction air . Stringent FDA repackaging production transfilling process must meet . Strength purity testing require `` medical grade '' oxygen least 99.5 % pure . Such medical grade oxygen container typically result 100 % oxygen provide participant .</detailed_description>
