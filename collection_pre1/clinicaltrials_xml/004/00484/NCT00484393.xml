	<brief_title>Tetracaine Compared Placebo Reducing Pain With Palivizumab - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : 1 ) To determine tetracaine 4 % gel ( Ametop ® ) reduce pain intramuscular palivizumab compare placebo pediatric patient 1 month 2 year age . Rationale : Premedication systemic analgesic show effective reduce pain acute localize insult . EMLA tetracaine show decrease pain associate immunization . EMLA require 60 minute application , decrease usefulness busy clinic . Tetracaine quicker onset action therefore may suitable use busy clinic . Efficacy tetracaine prior palivizumab report therefore know reduce pain associate intramuscular palivizumab injection . Setting : Respiratory synctial virus ( RSV ) clinic pediatric outpatient ward Surrey Memorial Hospital . Procedure : A notice post RSV clinic inviting parent contact research staff interested participating study . When parent contact staff study , nurse pharmacist involve study meet parent review eligibility obtain informed consent . Once informed consent obtain subject randomize study pharmacist receive either tetracaine 4 % gel ( Ametop® ) placebo administration next palivizumab injection ( study injection 1 ) ; 4 block randomization design use . At next injection ( study injection 2 ) subject receive either tetracaine placebo , whichever agent receive study injection 1 . The subject serve control . The placebo ( Aquatain ; Whitehall-Robins , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) visually cosmetically similar tetracaine 4 % gel . One gram drug placebo dispense unit dose 5mL oral syrinx , heat seal prevent evaporation store refrigerator one week , discard unused redispensed . Tetracaine commercially available 1.5g tube produce approximately 1g tetracaine . On day immunization arrival clinic , clinic nurse unaware treatment assignment apply 1g tetracaine placebo subject 's thigh cover dressing ( opcit ; Smith Nephew ) . They record time application study gel . The clinic nurse remove dress study gel 30-45 minute record time removal . The gel wipe skin paper tissue . A 4-point scale ( none , mild , moderate , severe ) use assess local skin reaction remove study gel . Immediately injection site clean alcohol swab , dose ( 15mg/kg use current weight ) palivizumab administer use ½ - 5/8 inch 23-25 gauge needle . A RSV clinic nurse inject palivizumab within several minute gel removal ; clinic nurse aware treatment assignment subject . Study injection 1 2 video record . A mirror mount video recorder capture subject 's reaction face mirror image . The videotape continue subject calm follow injection . The subject hold parent injection provide whatever usual comfort measure would provide . Following injection parent ask question determine interpretation subject 's pain response injection factor may affect pain response . Once study injection complete video review pain assessed injection scorer use FLACC pain scale . The scorer one pediatric register nurse competent complete pain analysis infant . The scorer blind dose tetracaine placebo . Data Collection : The data collect include FLACC pain scale , parent assessment patient 's pain , factor affect pain response , well identify adverse effect tetracaine placebo . Sample size statistical Analysis : The number subject informed consent determine sample size . Statistical analysis involve descriptive statistic . Ethics : Confidentiality always maintain . No information identify child place data collection form . Every child assign number facilitate identification researcher . Informed consent obtain . Personnel : A team consist nurse , physician , clinical pharmacist SMH conduct study . All personnel currently involve day-to-day management child require expertise carry project . Timeline : The study submit ethical approval research ethic board , Fraser Health April 2007 . After approval anticipate patient enrolment start November 2007 complete enrolment March 2008 . A 4 month need analyze data prepare manuscript . Expected completion date project July 2008 . Budget : No additional cost expect study .</detailed_description>
