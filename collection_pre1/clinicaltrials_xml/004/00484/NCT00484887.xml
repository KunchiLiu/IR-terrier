	<detailed_description>This study collect large amount hernia mesh explants study change occur material vivo use information help design new mesh make novel material . We evidence current option inadequate lead complication . One main goal convince colleague change surgical practice publish educate data . The objective study establish large collection explanted mesh material country ; demonstrate common test utilized material engineer , vivo exposure mesh oxidant produce phagocytosis may lead chain scission , production free radical , overall degradation material physically chemically ; test mesh material decrease compliance , would account tendency mesh stiffen body reduce abdominal mobility lead chronic pain ; characterize histologic reaction tissue mesh ; utilize de-identified patient demographic identify possible clinical characteristic affect mesh degradation .</detailed_description>
