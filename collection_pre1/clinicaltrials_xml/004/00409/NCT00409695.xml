	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine response toxicity rate day 56 two different dose level thymoglobulin ( ATG ) [ anti-thymocyte globulin ( rabbit ) ] treatment steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate response rate day 28 . - To evaluate overall survival non-relapse mortality 6 month . - To determine toxicity profile thymoglobulin use treatment steroid-refractory aGVHD two dose schedule . - To characterize pharmacokinetic profile thymoglobulin two dose schedule . - To analyze biomarkers cellular drug effect quantify T-cell apoptosis aim find minimal effective dose . - To determine immune-reconstitution administration thymoglobulin patient steroid-refractory aGVHD dose schedule .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GvHD common side effect stem cell transplant . It cause type white blood cell ( lymphocyte ) . ATG design kill lymphocyte commonly use help prevent treat GvHD treat steroid-refractory aGvHD . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You ask question medical history . You complete physical exam . You blood draw ( 2 tablespoon ) routine test check viral infection . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . You also biopsy site suspect affected aGvHD . The study doctor describe type biopsy procedure , depend part body affect disease . If early biopsy perform confirmed aGvHD , need biopsy repeat study . If find eligible participate study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 group . Participants Group 1 receive high dose ATG vein . Participants Group 2 receive low dose ATG vein . You equal chance 1 2 group . Participants group receive dos ATG 4-6 hour , 1 time day every day total 3 dos . During study , able remain steroid drug may receive treatment aGvHD ( tacrolimus cyclosporine ) . You also blood drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) learn effect ATG lymphocytes . You take study , disease stable determine study doctor , disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect . If take study , study doctor discus treatment option . After finish receiving study medication , come clinic regularly schedule follow-up visit . At first , see clinic week 1 month . You also additional blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon ) biomarker test ( test look drug work body ) . After first month follow-up visit , come visit every week study , continue least 2 consecutive ( back back ) evaluation disease status see disease stable . This investigational study . ATG FDA approve commercially available . You and/or insurance provider financially responsible cost ATG study . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients underwent first allogeneic transplant malignancy cell ( bone marrow , peripheral stem cell , cord blood ) donor ( match mismatched relate unrelated ) source . 2 . Biopsyproven , grade IIIV aGVHD follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) source ( bone marrow , peripheral blood cord blood stem cell ) . Enrollment may start prior result biopsy case high clinical suspicion aGVHD . 3 . Early steroidrefractory aGVHD . This define NR PD minimum 3 day 1 week 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone . 4 . Ability sign inform consent . 5 . Ability return clinical followup specify protocol . 6 . Inability taper define patient &lt; = 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone unable taper without resultant increase acute GVHD stage . 7 . Patients reflare GVHD define worsen 1 stage acute GVHD patient initially respond . 1 . Relapsed malignancy . 2 . Acute GVHD result second subsequent transplant donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . 3 . Active , uncontrolled infection . 4 . Patients receive secondline immunosuppressive treatment GVHD beyond corticosteroid calcineurin inhibitor . Topical steroid , oral budesonide extracorporeal photochemotherapy start time steroid allow . 5 . Lifethreatening infusion reaction hypersensitivity formulation ATG past . 6 . Patients pregnant breast feeding .</criteria>
