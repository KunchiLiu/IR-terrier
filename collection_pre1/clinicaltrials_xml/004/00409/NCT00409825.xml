	<brief_title>Study Pharmacology 17-OHPC Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recently complete trial National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) -sponsored Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units ( MFMU ) Network demonstrate intramuscular 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate ( 17-OHPC ) substantially reduce rate preterm birth woman high risk preterm delivery prior spontaneous preterm birth . No strategy treatment prevention preterm birth proven effective . Consequently , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists cautiously support treatment point much information therapy alternative therapy require . Although large body evidence exist safety treatment , almost nothing known pharmacology agent , especially pregnancy . The purpose study define pharmacology 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate pregnancy . This protocol focus pharmacokinetics placental transport provide preliminary data pharmacoepidemiology 17-OHPC . The primary research question study : Do pharmacokinetics 17-OHPC represented area concentration vs. time curve IM injection 250 mg 17-OHPC differ second third trimester pregnancy ? We obtain blood sample prior daily one week injection 17-OHPC ( 8 sample total ) two part study , optional third part eligible subject . Additionally , blood sample collect prior weekly injection study drug time delivery . Approximately 60 subject ( age 18-45 ) accrue one Obstetrical Fetal Pharmacology Research Units ( OPRU ) Network site , 15 Magee-Womens Hospital University Pittsburgh Medical Center . Study treatment administer delivery . The total duration multi-center study 2-3 year .</detailed_description>
