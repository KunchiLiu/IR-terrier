	<brief_summary>There subgroup child autism appear develop typically period time , lose social language skill , regress . A recent study Vargas co-worker Johns Hopkins demonstrate regressive type autism associate chronic brain inflammation show abnormal production inflammatory cytokine among abnormality . This present study test effectiveness minocycline , antibiotic anti-inflammatory property , treat regressive autism . Although behavioral therapy improve symptom autism , medical treatment disorder , many child ongoing behavioral difficulty . A medicine anti-inflammatory property may beneficial child regressive autism . This open-label trial , mean child study receive minocycline . They also receive vitamin B6 reduce possible chance side effect minocycline . Children age 3 12 regressive autism may eligible study . The child take minocycline vitamin B6 daily 6 month . Prior start medication vitamin B6 , child receive comprehensive diagnostic assessment autism well physical examination , medical history , laboratory test . Children receive ongoing assessment monitor behavior , communication , language skill , medical issue 2 week , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month . Children respond treatment receive additional 3 month minocycline vitamin B6 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism neurodevelopmental disorder result abnormalities social language development associate rigid repetitive behavior . Although strong evidence heritability , involve gene identify . The prevalence autism spectrum disorder may common 1 166 . The average concordance rate monozygotic twin 70 % suggest environmental factor play role disease . Subgroups autistic child seem unusually sensitive infection , immunization dietary factor , none factor causally identify disease . Nevertheless , autoimmunity consider play role basis indirect evidence . There evidence-based efficacious treatment autism . There subgroup child autism appear develop typically period time , lose skill , regress . A recent study Vargas co-worker Johns Hopkins demonstrate regressive subtype autism associate chronic brain neuroinflammation exemplify activation microglia astroglia abnormal production inflammatory cytokine growth factor assay tissue sample ( brain bank ) CS . The author remark response similar see neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , chronic microglia activation appear responsible sustained neuroinflammatory response facilitate production multiple neurotoxic mediator . Chronic neuroglial activation could result abnormal persistence fetal development pattern . In scenario neuroglial activation could play role initiate maintain pathology . Alternatively , neuroglial activation may secondary response initiate causal factor ( ) direct effector injury . Since neuroglial activation require nuclear translocation pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B , since inhibitor NF-kappa-B good CNS penetrance available , role neuroinflammation initiate sustain autistic condition probed . The antibiotic minocycline powerful inhibitor microglial activation , apparently blockade NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation . Minocycline neuroprotective mouse model amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) Huntington 's disease recently show stabilize course Huntington 's disease humans 2-year period . To evaluate possibility benefit autistic child , propose conduct open-label trial anti-inflammatory antibiotic minocycline , agent reduces inflammation block nuclear translocation proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa-B . Minocycline Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved treatment variety infection widely use treatment adolescent acne . Minocycline currently phase III trial treatment Huntington 's disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . This proposal initial 6-month , single-arm , label , open-label study ( 3 month extension phase offer responder ) evaluate dose safety efficacy minocycline 10 child , age 3 12 year , primary diagnosis autism history developmental regression . The subject evaluate diagnostic/behavioral assessment , extent neuroinflammation judge CSF cytokine/chemokine profile 6-month treatment . Subjects also give 0.6 mg/kg vitamin B6 twice day prophylactic possible minocycline induce nausea vomit . If result feasibility study encouraging , expect conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled trial minocycline therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The sample child : Diagnosis idiopathic autism regression Age 3 12 year Willingness undergo lumbar puncture evaluation proinflammatory CSF cytokines Stable behavioral plus minus medication therapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Significant prematurity birth ( le 32 week gestation ) ; birthweight significantly normal gestational age ( SGAsmall gestational age ) . Neurologic disorder include cerebral palsy , uncontrolled epilepsy , LandauKleffner syndrome . Evidence renal insufficiency hepatic disease ( reduce incidence sideeffects , since minocycline excrete kidney follow hepatic metabolism ) Increased risk develop lupuslike syndrome minocycline administration ( positive antidouble strand DNA antinucleosome antibody test baseline , presence first degree relative S.L.E . ) Recent ( less two month prior study entry ) initiation behavioral therapy program new psychotropic medication trial . Subjects one medications/supplements list possible interaction high dose B6 supplementation . For family interested study medications/supplements time intake , instructed wean medication appropriate ( work prescribe MD ) , enrol 6week washout period .</criteria>
