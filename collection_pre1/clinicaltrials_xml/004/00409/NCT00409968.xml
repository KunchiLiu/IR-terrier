	<brief_summary>The goal screen study find eligible take part 1 4 different research study . Objectives : This trial refer `` umbrella trial '' . The BATTLE program consist umbrella trial plus four phase II protocols umbrella patient enrol . Patients first enroll BATTLE umbrella trial undergo tumor biomarker analysis use assign one four phase II study . All patient enrol one phase II BATTLE protocols must enrol protocol . The primary objective phase II study : Primary Objectives : â€¢ To determine 8-week progression-free survival rate ( i.e . disease control rate ) patient advance NSCLC fail least one prior chemotherapy regimen . Secondary Objectives : - Determine overall response rate - Determine overall survival - Determine time disease progression - Assess safety/toxicity study treatment ( ) - Assess biomarker modulation tumor tissue serum sample treatment - Assess plasma intra-tumor concentration study treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study `` umbrella '' screen study group 5 study know BATTLE ( Biomarker-integrated Approaches Targeted Therapy Lung Cancer Elimination ) program . In order participate one research study , must first agree take part screen study , use determine eligible . After participate study , may assign study use investigational drug . The investigational drug ( ) use 4 study approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) commercial use setting ; however , FDA permit use research study . If agree participate screening study , complete medical history ( include smoke history ) record physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . You blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You also blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw check blood clot function , thyroid function , lipid ( fat ) level . You urine test , performance status evaluation ( question ability perform everyday activity ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . Your tumor evaluate chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate status disease . You brain MRI . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test receiving study drug . A sample tumor tissue collect biomarker analysis . If tumor tissue reach , able participate research study . To collect tumor biopsy , either CT-guided core biopsy , bronchoscopy , type biopsy ( subcutaneous , cutaneous , lymph node ) . You ask stop take medication affect blood-clotting ( aspirin coumadin ) biopsy procedure . For cutaneous ( skin ) biopsy , give local anesthetic either spray shot numb skin . A small cut make remove piece affected skin . For CT-guided core biopsy lung , subcutaneous , and/or lymph node biopsy , tissue sample withdrawn organ suspect tumor mass use thin needle syringe . The needle guide view physician CT scan . Any site safely biopsied consider collection tissue . Sites commonly biopsied include kidney , adrenal gland , brain . For bronchoscopy , give drug relax , local anesthetic spray nose throat numb area . A slim , flexible tube light place nose mouth lung . A small brush feed tube lung . The brush gently scrape sample lung tissue . Tweezers feed tube collect tissue sample ( biopsy ) . A small amount water spray lung suction tube collect tissue sample mucous sample . For CT-guided core biopsy bronchoscopy , take medication mouth solid food least 6 hour procedure . You also liquids 2 hour procedure . If eligible take part study , assign 1 4 research study base result tumor analysis . You ask read sign separate informed consent take part one research study . You right leave study time . If choose stop participating study , contact study chair and/or research nurse . Your doctor may decide take study medical condition get bad and/or unable comply study requirement . This investigational study . Up 250 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

The patient &gt; /= 18 year age . 12 . The patient sign informed consent . 13 . The patient eligible disease free previously treat malignancy , previous NSCLC , great two year . Patients history prior basal cell carcinoma skin preinvasive carcinoma cervix exempt exclusion . 14 . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month , tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy.Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately.The patient , man , agree use effective contraception abstinence . 15 . Subject must consider legally capable provide consent participation study . 1 . The patient receive prior investigational therapy , chemotherapy , surgery , radiotherapy within 4 week initiate study drug 2 . The patient undergone prior thoracic abdominal surgery within 28 day study entry , exclude prior diagnostic biopsy . 3 . The patient receive radiation therapy measurable tumor within 6 month . Patients allow local irradiation management tumorrelated symptom ( bone , brain ) . However , patient active new disease grow previously irradiate site , patient eligible participate study . 4 . The patient significant medical history unstable medical condition ( unstable systemic disease : congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Functional Classification class II worse ) , recent myocardial infarction within 3 month , unstable angina , active infection ( i.e . currently treat antibiotic ) , uncontrolled hypertension ) .
