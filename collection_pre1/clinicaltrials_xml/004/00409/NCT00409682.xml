	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Adalimumab Pediatric Subjects With Moderate Severe Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>M06-806 ( NCT # NCT00409682 ) Phase 3 , multi-center , randomize , double-blind ( DB ) , efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study design evaluate efficacy 2 dose regimen induction maintenance clinical remission pediatric subject age 6 17 ( inclusive ) moderate severe Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ( define Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index [ PCDAI &gt; 30 ] ) . Subjects must either failed conventional therapy CD previously receive infliximab lose response/had intolerance infliximab . Approximately 186 pediatric subject age 6 17 plan enter study approximately 55 site US , Canada , Europe . At least 80 subject ≥ 13 year old Baseline one-third one-half study population subject previously lose response intolerant infliximab . The duration study 65 week , include 1- 3-week Screening period , Induction period , Maintenance period , 70-day follow-up phone call subject either terminate early study rollover extension study ( [ NCT # 00686374 ] , evaluate long-term maintenance clinical response , safety , tolerability repeat administration adalimumab ) . All subject receive induction regimen administer Baseline ( Week 0 ) Week 2 . The open-label ( OL ) induction dose base subject 's Baseline body weight . Subjects weigh ≥ 40 kg receive 160 mg Week 0 80 mg adalimumab Week 2 . Subjects weigh &lt; 40 kg receive 80 mg Week 0 40 mg adalimumab Week 2 . At Week 4 , subject randomize 1:1 1 2 DB maintenance treatment group ( Low-Dose High-Dose ) , stratify Week 4 clinical responder status ( clinical response define decrease PCDAI ≥ 15 point Baseline score ) , body weight Week 4 prior exposure infliximab . Subjects randomize High-Dose treatment group receive either 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneous ( SC ) every week ( eow ) ( Week 4 body weight ≥ 40 kg ) 20 mg adalimumab SC eow ( Week 4 body weight &lt; 40 kg ) . Subjects randomize Low-Dose treatment group receive either 20 mg adalimumab SC eow ( Week 4 body weight ≥ 40 kg ) 10 mg adalimumab SC eow ( Week 4 body weight &lt; 40 kg ) . Subject 's body weight take Week 26 use readjust maintenance dose regimen subject whose body weight increase &lt; 40 kg ≥ 40 kg study . Subjects expect remain blind eow therapy throughout 48-week study DB Maintenance period . However , start Week 12 study visit , subject experience disease flare ( increase PCDAI ≥ 15 point compare Week 4 absolute PCDAI 30 ) non-responders ( achieve decrease PCDAI score least 15 point compare Baseline score 2 consecutive visit least 2 week apart ) could switch blind eow dosing blind every week ( ew ) dosing , continue blind dose . During blinded ew treatment , subject continue experience flare meet definition non-response follow 8 week course DB ew therapy , switch OL ew therapy . The dosage OL ew therapy 20 mg subject &lt; 40 kg 40 mg subject ≥ 40 kg . This study use PCDAI determine efficacy study drug . The primary efficacy endpoint proportion subject clinical remission Week 26 , measure PCDAI intent-to-treat population . Clinical remission define PCDAI score ≤ 10 . The clinical response indicator include clinical remission define PCDAI score Week 52 clinical response define PCDAI score Week 26 Week 52 . The patient report outcome change Baseline total IMPACT III score Week 26 Week 52 . The safety parameter ( adverse event , laboratory data , vital sign ) assess visit throughout study .</detailed_description>
