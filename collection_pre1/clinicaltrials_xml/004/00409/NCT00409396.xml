	<brief_title>A Study Determine Whether Urinary PGE-M Levels Correlate With Ulcerative Colitis Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The available clinical measure ulcerative colitis activity overly influence functional symptom . Placebo response rate clinical trial high . Several non-invasive biomarkers currently available assess IBD disease activity include erythrocyte sedimentation rate , c-reactive protein fecal calprotectin . Although marker hold promise , performance less ideal . need simple , non-invasive biologic measure UC disease . Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) involve prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) synthesis express epithelial inflammatory condition cancer . We develop assay quantify major urinary metabolite PGE2 , PGE-M. PGE-M previously show elevated urine patient advance colorectal neoplasia relative control . We recently show PGEm sensitive specific marker Crohn 's disease activity ( Accepted publication DDW 2006 ) .</detailed_description>
