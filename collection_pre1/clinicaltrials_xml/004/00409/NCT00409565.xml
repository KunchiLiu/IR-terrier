	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination two new drug , cetuximab ( Erbitux ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) increase effectiveness treatment head neck cancer . Cetuximab recently approve FDA head neck cancer ( locally regionally advanced ) use combination radiation therapy . Cetuximab also approve FDA treatment colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Cetuximab Bevacizumab Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 40,000 new case head neck cancer diagnose annually United States 1 . Squamous cell carcinoma account 90 % head neck cancer case . Patients squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( HNSCC ) usually present locoregionally advanced disease . Initial presentation distant metastasis may occur 10 % patient . However , recurrence disease either local distant sit potentially curative treatment surgery , radiation , and/or chemotherapy occur 50 % patient . Therefore , majority patient HNSCC develop recurrent metastatic disease course illness . These patient dismal prognosis median survival 6-9 month 2-4 . Active single agent head neck squamous cell carcinoma include methotrexate , bleomycin , cisplatin , carboplatin , 5-FU , paclitaxel , docetaxel , CPT-11 . A small randomized study show cisplatin monotherapy prolongs survival compare best supportive care 5 . Response rate single agent range 10-40 % 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 . Combination chemotherapy platinum agent , spite achieve high response rate ( 30 % phase III trial ) , show produce survival benefit compare single agent randomized comparison recurrent/metastatic head neck cancer 2 , 4 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Patients must histologically cytologically confirm Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck either ( ) metastatic ( i.e . American Joint Committee Cancer Staging System , 6th edition , stage IVC ) ( b ) recurrent , judge incurable surgery radiation . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm CT scan ) . RECIST criterion use ( see section 9 ) . Therapeutic history conformance follow : No one prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimen may include biologic/targeted agent . No one prior regimen ( chemotherapy biologic/targeted ) recurrent/metastatic disease ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/L platelet &gt; 75,000/L total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) 5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Urine protein screen urine analysis Urine Protein Creatinine ( UPC ) ratio ( see Appendix ) . For UPC ratio &gt; 0.5 , 24hour urine protein obtain level &lt; 1000 mg patient enrollment . Note : UPC ratio spot urine estimation 24 urine protein excretion UPC ratio 1 roughly equivalent 24hour urine protein 1 gm . UPC ratio calculate use follow formula : [ urine protein ] / [ urine creatinine ] protein creatinine report mg/Dl [ ( urine protein ) x0.088 ] / [ urine creatinine ] urine creatinine report mmol/L All patient baseline tumor tissue available EGFR determination ( therapeutic target cetuximab ) biomarker study . Patients without available tissue baseline may undergo tumor biopsy . Patients provide consent accessible tumor repeat biopsy 14 day ( interval 1216 day acceptable ) post initiation therapy . Priority study entry give patient easily accessible tumor consent repeat biopsy . Study entry restrict patient agree biopsy . If patient enrolls study later refuse biopsy ( exclude diagnostic ) , he/she may remain study . No prior treatment cetuximab bevacizumab EGFR VEGF target agent . Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) biologic/targeted agent within 3 week . At least 3 month elapse prior therapy monoclonal antibody . At least 3 week elapse prior radiotherapy . Patients must history gross hemoptysis ( define bright red blood ½ teaspoon ) coagulopathy . Patients history major tumorrelated bleeding control despite locoregional treatment high risk recurrent tumorrelated bleeding exclude . Patients history thrombosis ( e.g . pulmonary embolism deep venous thrombosis ) therapeutic anticoagulation ( prophylactic use warfarin 1 mg per day allow ) INR le 1.5 registration . Patients history hypertension must wellcontrolled ( ≤150/100 ) stable regimen antihypertensive therapy . Patients tumor invade major vessel ( e.g . carotid ) show unequivocally image study exclude due possibility increase risk tumor bleed bevacizumab therapy . No major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior study enrollment , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . No history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day prior registration . No serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . No unstable angina myocardial infarction within previous 6 month ; uncontrolled hypertension ; symptomatic congestive heart failure ; serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication ; clinically significant peripheral vascular disease ; history CNS cerebrovascular ischemia stroke within last 6 month ; active serious infection . No coexist medical condition would preclude full compliance study . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis increase risk bevacizumab . Patients history prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody . Patients know hypersensitivity Chinese hamster ovary cell product recombinant human antibody . No history prior malignancy , exception curatively treat squamous cell basal carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer , unless 3year diseasefree interval . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use cetuximab bevacizumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Pregnant woman exclude study cetuximab bevacizumab potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother cetuximab bevacizumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated cetuximab bevacizumab . The effect cetuximab bevacizumab develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant study , inform treat physician immediately . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible drug interaction cetuximab bevacizumab . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Inclusion Women Minorities Both men woman member ethnic group eligible trial . The propose study population illustrate table . Inclusion Women Plan : The gender distribution head neck cancer patient detail table .
