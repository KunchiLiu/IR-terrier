	<brief_title>Study Adalimumab Treatment Induction Maintenance Clinical Remission Subjects With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , study design evaluate safety efficacy adalimumab induce maintain clinical remission subject moderate severe Crohn 's Disease . Approximately 1000 subject diagnosis moderate severe Crohn 's Disease ( Harvey Bradshaw Index score &gt; = 7 ) enrol approximately 200 site within Europe . Enrollment dependent meeting screen criterion . Study medication administer subcutaneous injection . At Baseline ( Week 0 ) , subject receive dose 160 mg adalimumab . At Week 2 , subject receive dose 80 mg adalimumab . Starting Week 4 , subject begin receive injection adalimumab 40 mg every week continue every week dose Week 20 except case disease flare non-response . Starting Week 12 , subject experience disease flare ( flare define increase Harvey Bradshaw Index &gt; =3 total Index score &gt; =7 compare Week 4 ) respond adalimumab treatment ( non-response define decrease Harvey Bradshaw Index fewer 3 point compare Baseline ) permit increase study therapy adalimumab 40 mg every week . If subject continue demonstrate lack improvement every week adalimumab therapy , may withdraw study . Prior Week 8 subject allow increase decrease Crohn 's specific concomitant medication except event concomitant Crohn 's treatment-related toxicity assess moderate severe . Changes concomitant medication at/after Week 8 Investigator 's discretion . Subjects evaluate safety efficacy Baseline ( Week 0 ) , Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 20 , unscheduled visit . Efficacy evaluation include HBI , Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( SIBDQ ) , Work Productivity Activity Index ( WPAI ) questionnaire , fistula count , health care resource utilization ( HCRU ) , evaluation CD-related extra-intestinal manifestation ( EIMs ) . Safety assessment include vital sign , physical examination , general laboratory analysis , urinalysis , monitor adverse event ( AEs ) .</detailed_description>
