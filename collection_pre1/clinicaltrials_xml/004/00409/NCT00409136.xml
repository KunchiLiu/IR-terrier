	<brief_title>Multi-Center Human Alert Trial Prevent DVT PE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information Rationale Study : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) often avoidable hospitalized patient proven prevention strategy establish patient risk . North American European prophylaxis guideline widely disseminate . However , despite intensive educational effort , VTE prevention remain underutilized . At Brigham Women 's Hospital , undertook comprehensive program aim increase frequency VTE prophylaxis high risk patient . This novel strategy require : 1 ) devising risk score reliably quickly identify patient high risk VTE , 2 ) conduct randomize control trial high risk patient without prophylaxis randomize intervention control group . The intervention group 's physician receive single alert explain patient high risk , receive prophylaxis , urge prophylaxis select template available pharmacological mechanical option . In contrast , control group 's physician receive alert . Each 8 common risk factor weight accord point scale . At least 4 score point require deem `` high risk '' VTE . 3 8 risk factor consider major assign score 3 point : 1 . Cancer 2 . Prior VTE 3 . Hypercoagulability One 8 risk factor , surgery , consider intermediate assign score 2 . 4 8 risk factor consider minor assign score 1 point : 1 . Advanced age ( &gt; 70 year age ) 2 . Obesity ( Body Mass Index &gt; 29 ) 3 . Bed rest 4 . Hormone replacement therapy oral contraceptive There 2,506 patient randomize controlled trial computer alert : 1255 intervention group 1251 control group . The incidence symptomatic VTE 90 day high : 8.2 % control group . This high incidence validates 8 risk factor point score methodology . The intervention group overall 41 % reduction VTE , without increase major bleed . There 60 % reduction incidence symptomatic pulmonary embolism . Identification Patients Risk Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) : A VTE risk profile compute hospitalized patient use 8 common risk factor . Each risk factor weight accord point score . To included trial , point score must equal exceed 4 point . Minor ( Low ) Risk Factors ( 1 POINT ) : - Advanced Age ( &gt; 70 year age ) - Obesity ( BMI &gt; 29 , presence word `` obesity '' admission exam note ) - Bed rest / Immobility ( relate surgery ) - Female Hormone Replacement Therapy Oral Contraceptives Intermediate Risk Factor ( 2 POINTS ) : · Major Surgery ( &gt; 60 minute ) Major ( High ) Risk Factors ( 3 POINTS ) : - Cancer ( active ) - Prior VTE - Hypercoagulability Increased VTE risk define cumulative VTE risk score 4 , patient least 1 major risk factor ( cancer , prior VTE , hypercoagulability ) plus least 1 additional intermediate risk factor ( major surgery bed rest ) minor risk factor ( advanced age , obesity , hormone replacement therapy/oral contraceptive ) become eligible . In absence major risk factor , patient 1 intermediate risk factor plus least 2 minor risk factor become eligible . Screening Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis : If cumulative VTE risk score ³4 , order review detect ongoing mechanical pharmacological prophylactic measure . Mechanical prophylactic measure include graduate compression stocking intermittent pneumatic compression device . Pharmacological prophylactic measure include unfractionated heparin , enoxaparin , dalteparin , fondaparinux , tinzaparin , warfarin . Randomization : Randomization Envelopes contain statement `` ALERT '' ( Intervention ) `` NO ALERT '' ( Control ) provide Harvard Clinical Research Institute ( HCRI ) , randomize patient meet inclusion criterion . The intervention inform responsible physician : 1 ) patient high risk VTE , 2 ) receiving prophylaxis , 3 ) VTE prophylaxis recommend . For control patient , VTE prevention guideline available , specific prompt provide use . Follow Up : Ninety-day follow-up perform study patient medical record review contact subject 's Primary Care Physician . Data Collection Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint clinically diagnose DVT PE 90 day . Safety endpoint include total mortality hemorrhagic event 30 90 day , respectively . We define major bleed intracranial , intraocular , retroperitoneal , pericardial , bleed require surgical intervention result hemoglobin loss great 3 g/l . DVT diagnose loss vein compressibility ultrasound fill defect CT scan conventional contrast venography . PE diagnose positive contrast chest CT scan , high-probability ventilation perfusion scan , conventional pulmonary angiogram .</detailed_description>
