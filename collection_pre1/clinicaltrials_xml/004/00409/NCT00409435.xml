	<brief_title>A Study Pyridostigmine Postural Tachycardia Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study do outpatient General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Charlton 7 involve two visit . Visit 1 take 3 hour , Visit 2 occur 2 day Visit 1 take 2 hour . You put one two group chance ( flip coin ) . One group take placebo ( inactive substance ) , group 180 mg pyridostigmine time release formulation . Both placebo pyridostigmine look identical take one capsule per day 3 day . Neither study doctor know time treatment whether treatment give active inactive . However , case emergency , information available . For two visit , follow test procedure perform : - When arrive GCRC , general medical neurological examination height weight measurement . - Questionnaires . You ask answer series question autonomic symptom ( rapid heart rate , feel tiredness , cold sweaty hand ) two visit . The questionnaire give first visit take approximately 30 minute complete . The questionnaire give second visit take approximately 10 minute complete . - Autonomic Reflex Screen . An autonomic reflex screen do visit . This consist follow : - Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test ( QSART ) : QSART routine clinical test evaluate response sweat gland drug , acetylcholine . One capsule place forearm three leg foot . The test do pass small electrical current , 5 minute , activate nerve supply sweat gland . You feel slight burn sensation . - Cardiovascular recording : Blood pressure , heart rate , cardiovascular measurement study place electrode chest finger wrist cuff continuous blood pressure recording . - Valsalva maneuver : This involve blow hard bugle ( like blow balloon ) 15 second . - Head-up tilt : Following period rest ( least 5 minute ) , tilt angle 80 degree recording make 30 minute . On Visit 1 , one hour take study medication , test repeat . This test do Visit 2 . - Hormone level measurement : This do visit . An IV insert vein arm approximately one teaspoon blood drawn lie one teaspoon standing . This repeat Visit 1 , one hour study drug give . A total four teaspoon blood draw Visit 1 2 teaspoon draw Visit 2 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis postural tachycardia syndrome use follow criterion : Orthostatic heart rate increment great equal 30 beat per minute ( bpm ) within 5 minute headup tilt . Symptoms orthostatic intolerance . These include weakness , lightheadedness , blur vision , nausea , palpitation , difficulty concentration thinking . Both criterion must fulfil . Pregnant lactate woman Presence failure organ system systemic illness could affect autonomic function patient 's ability cooperate study Hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism Clinically significant coronary artery disease Medications could interfere autonomic test Previous treatment pyridostigmine POTS . Patients must take pyridostigmine past month</criteria>
