	<brief_title>Phase IIa Safety Light Dose-escalation Study Patients With Primary Recurrent/High-grade Glioma Using Litx™ System Confirm Zone Tumor Destruction During Intraoperative Treatment Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Light Infusion Technology ( Litx™ ) locoregional cancer treatment systemically administer light-activated drug ( LS11 ) activate locally illuminate diseased tissue use light-emitting diode ( LEDs ) specific wavelength . The activated photosensitizer reacts endogenous oxygen yield highly reactive specie oxygen cause destruction cellular structure mitochondrion , lysosome cell wall lead irreversible cell damage tissue death . Either twenty-four twelve hour prior surgery , patient receive intravenous dose 1 mg/kg LS11 , give IV slow push 3-5 minute . Following craniotomy , patient undergo intraoperative placement single Light Source , centrally place within tumor , direct visualization prior tumor resection . Following placement light source ( depth end light bar cortical surface calculate pre-operative MRI spiral CT scan , centralize within main tumor bulk ) , light deliver follow predetermined escalation schedule ( either 100 J/cm 200 J/cm ) 20 mW/cm light energy treatment time 1 hour 24 minute ( 100J/cm ) 2 hour 46 minute ( 200 J/cm ) . The Light Source manually remove tumor maximally resect . The resected tumor marginal tissue submit pathology determine depth cell death , extent tumor tissue contain close vessel , evidence vessel closure damage tissue outside project kill zone .</detailed_description>
