	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine amifostine combination IMRT mitigate decrease production saliva submandibular sublingual salivary gland patient HNSCC . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To establish parotid gland dose volume histogram ( DVH ) versus measure flow relationship patient population : - When mean dose &lt; 24-26 Gy ( shift recovery time leave ) - When mean dose &gt; 24-26 Gy ( DVH shift ) 2 . To observe mucositis follow low dose RT area : - Upper lip - Lower lip - Right cheek - Left cheek - Right ventral lateral tongue - Left ventral lateral tongue - Floor mouth - Soft palate - Hard palate . 3 . To observe incidence pattern occipital scalp epilation ; 4 . To observe incidence dysphagia use List Performance Status Scale ( LPSS ) ; 5 . To evaluate safety profile amifostine patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Amifostine design protect cell normal tissue toxicity chemotherapy radiation therapy . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine blood test . Your complete medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , weight , height . You dental exam . You complete questionnaire ask question dry mouth . In addition , ask question diet eating habit . This take long 10 minute . Also , saliva collect simple , in-office oral test measure saliva flow rate 5 minute period . Women able child must negative blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive IMRT Monday -Friday 6-7 week period . In addition , 2-3 hour IMRT , also take pre-medications mouth prevent potential nausea skin reaction ( anti-nausea &amp; antihistamine ) , include drink water.You receive daily IMRT therapy , exclude weekend holiday . The radiation dose design conform 3-dimensional shape tumor control intensity radiation beam focus high radiation dose tumor ( surround normal tissue ) . Thirty ( 30 ) 60 minute every IMRT treatment , receive study drug two injection beneath skin . IMRT take 30 minute complete . Every day receive IMRT ( Monday-Friday ) , ask drug take side effect experience . Your vital sign record . Every week ( Weeks 2-7 ) , complete oral physical exam . You complete questionnaire ask question dry mouth . You ask question ability perform daily activity ( performance status evaluation ) . Your weight also measure . You ask complete symptom survey ( M.D . Anderson Symptom Inventory ) ask rate symptom much symptom interfere daily activity . On last day receive IMRT amifostine ( whichever last ) , complete oral exam complete questionnaire dry mouth . Six ( 6 ) week end therapy , end-of-therapy visit . At visit , complete physical oral exam saliva collection . You complete questionnaire dry mouth . Your weight measure , performance status evaluation . Blood ( ( 2 ) tablespoon ) draw routine blood test . You ask drug take side effect experience . In addition , ask question diet eating habit . You ask complete symptom survey ( M.D . Anderson Symptom Inventory ) ask rate symptom much symptom interfere daily activity every week 2 month end radiation therapy . After point , ask complete symptom survey every month 1 year . You follow-up visit 4 , 7 , 10 , 12 month end therapy . At visit , complete oral exam saliva collection . You complete dry mouth questionnaire . Your weight measure , performance status evaluation ask question diet eating habit . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . Amifostine FDA approve commercially available . Amifostine FDA approve give needle vein FDA approve give needle skin . Up 20 patient take part study . All patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
