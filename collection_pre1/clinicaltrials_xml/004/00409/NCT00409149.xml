An advertisement local newspaper medical center 's web site publish ( appear IRB form ) Recruitment continue overall quota subject ( 50 per group ) meet . Randomization Subjects randomly assign treatment group utilize computerize randomization system . A random list generate study statistician . The random list keep seal envelope study site . The list readily available case emergency . Follow Subjects assess begin end trial 6 month later . Compliance questioner fill several stage trial describe section 8 . Study Population Inclusion Criteria - Adult men woman 18 year . - Patients use anti hypertensive medication mean systolic blood pressure measurements 120-180 mm Hg and/or mean diastolic measurement 70-100 mm Hg determine 24 hour Holter test . - Patients use anti hypertensive medication mean systolic blood pressure measurements 130-180 mm Hg mean diastolic measurement 80-100 mmHg . - Signed informed consent Exclusion Criteria - Cardiovascular event within past 6 month - Inability walk independently 15 less minute . - Poorly control insulin dependant diabetes mellitus Hg A1c measurements 7.5 . - Inflammatory bowl disorder - Acute malignancy life expectancy le 5 year . - Pregnancy lactation - A body mass index 35 . - More 20 alcoholic beverage per weak . - Change anti hypertensive medication within last 3 month . - Planning change smoke habit Treatment subject The CALM group receive weekly 4 hour group coach session 16 week . Each session include follow part : 1 . A group aerobic walk session . Participants reach target heart rate determine advance 60-75 % maximal heart rate expect age accordance physical ability . The group walk last maximum one hour . All participant encourage walk least 3 time per week independently . 2 . A 1 hour weekly Qi Gong session . The class include 45 minute slow movement exercise emphasize relaxation , abdominal breathing visualization stretch meditation . A 15 minute prerecord guided imagery meditation aim reduce blood pressure perform seated supine position . Participants give CD 15 minute mediation encourage use home day . 3 . Dietary counseling cooking instruction form healthy home cook routine base naturopathic rice diet approach . A group meal prepared participant session participant dine together . All participant encourage follow diet home . 4 . Group therapy meet focus stress management technique mind - body balance . Emphasis put develop communication skill base nonjudgmental empathic approach , method deal stress anxiety , discard low self esteem negative thought pattern develop positive thinking pattern . The DASH control group receive group coaching session 16 week . Each session include follow part : 1 . A group aerobic walk session . Participants reach target heart rate calculate advance 60-75 % maximal heart rate expect age . The group walk last maximum one hour . All participant encourage walk least 3 time per week independently . 2 . Dietary counseling cooking instruction accord standard DASH diet . This include diet rich fruit , vegetable low fat dairy product . A group meal prepared participant session participant dine together . All participant encourage follow diet home . Assessment Efficacy Primary end point efficacy assess compare mean BP measurement CALM group mean BP measurements DASH control group . Blood pressure measurement perform 24 hour Holter BP monitoring begin end trial . Secondary end point efficacy assed compare CALM DASH program respect effect use BP medication weight loss . Lab test pulse wave analysis also assess begin end study . Pulse wave analysis Assessment arterial stiffness perform , baseline , end 16 week trial follow 6 month , noninvasive technique use commercially available SphygmoCor System ( AtCor Medical , LTD , Australia ) . All measurement perform S.E patient recombinant position room temperature 25oc . In brief , peripheral pressure waveform record radial artery wrist , use applanation tonometry high-fidelity micromanometer ( Millar Instruments ) . When 20 sequential waveform record , validate 16-18 generalized transfer function apply generate corresponding central aortic pressure waveform . Augmentation index ( AIx ) augment pressure ( AP ) derive calculation , use pulse wave analysis technique . The merging point incident reflect wave ( inflection point ) identify generate aortic pressure waveform . AP calculate maximum systolic pressure minus pressure inflection point . AIx calculate AP divide pulse pressure express percentage . Higher value AIx indicate increase wave reflection periphery earlier return reflect wave result increase pulse wave velocity ( attributable increase arterial stiffness ) , vice versa . Only high-quality recording , define in-device quality index &gt; 80 % ( derive algorithm include average pulse height , pulse height variation , diastolic variation , maximum rate rise peripheral waveform ) curve acceptable upon visual inspection perform one investigator , include analysis . All pulse wave measurement take sit position , quiet , temperature control room ( 23 ± 1°C ) , least 15 minute rest period . Laboratory Tests At begin end study , blood drawn measurement hemoglobin , hemoglobin A1c , creatinine , liver function test , highly sensitive c-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) lipid profile include total cholesterol high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) triglyceride ( TG ) . LDL calculate . Five cc plasma preserve -70oc future evaluation oxidative stress ( oxLDL , MDA ) NO . Life Quality &amp; well questioner Patients fill MOS 36 life quality questionnaire beginning , week 4 , week 10 end trial . In addition specific questionnaire assess dietary cooking lifestyle fill beg end trial . These questionnaire six month follow period . Compliance Compliance questionnaires address three topic : adherence diet recommendation cook instruction home , number exercise session per week frequency use Qi Gong meditation disk home . Questionnaires filled end week 4,10 &amp; 16 ( end trial ) follow meet post 6 month . Assessment Safety No adverse event risk expect participant enrol trial . However , initially , strict dietary program may influence participant overall energy level . Transient symptom dizziness headache may also present early stage study participant couch advance maintain undesired influence . Nevertheless , adverse event report Adverse Event Form along probability adverse event study-related . Decreasing dos cessation BP Medications use BP medication dos change primary investigator patient healthcare physician . The physician charge reduce BP lower medication case systolic blood pressure decrease 110 mmHg participant present symptom low blood pressure weakness , ortostatizm , dizziness , presyncope syncope . Before change BP lowering medication patient encourage get another 24 hour holter BP measurement test . All change BP medication record .</detailed_description>
