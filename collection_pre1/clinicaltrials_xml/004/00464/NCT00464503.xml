	<detailed_description>The proximal tubular cell kidney responsible reabsorption proteins tubular lumen . In study use Opossum kidney ( OK ) cell , receptor-mediated protein endocytosis reduce statin , inhibitor 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA ( HMG-CoA ) reductase , widely use therapeutic reduction plasma cholesterol level ( 1 ) . In subsequent vitro study protein endocytosis human mixed proximal/distal kidney tubular cell investigate presence absence statin explore possible clinical relevance observation OK cell ( 2 ) . The uptake FITC-labeled albumin culture occur selectively proximal tubular cell absent distal tubular/collecting duct cell . Three statin ( simvastatin , pravastatin , rosuvastatin ) significantly inhibit uptake protein concentration-dependent way . This inhibitory effect statin could prevent co-addition mevalonate , product HMG-CoA reductase . This effect result statin-induced cytotoxicity since cell-viability unaffected . These data suggest statins potential inhibit albumin uptake human proximal nephron result inhibition HMG-CoA reductase proximal tubule cell . A reduced prenylation protein critically involved endocytosis put forward underlie mechanism . Knowing data suggest occurrence proteinuria patient treat high statin dos result reduce tubular reabsorption/endocytosis normally filter protein . To explore clinical relevance mechanism , composition urinary proteome statin treatment investigate normal healthy volunteer two-dimensional gel electrophoresis base proteomics analysis .</detailed_description>
