	<brief_summary>We believe baby Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome ( HLHS ) major open heart operation , measure thing like blood pressure , oxygen saturation , heart rate others , may impact development . Studying post-operative condition impact outcomes may help u protect baby well undergo surgery . This study look long-term outcome child HLHS , include mental development quality life . We use information child 's medical record see early oxygen delivery impact later development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Near-infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) Neurodevelopmental Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past twenty year , field congenital heart disease mark globally improve survival complex congenital heart surgery . These improved result clearly multi-factorial include advance diagnostic technology , surgical technique , perfusion strategy , pharmacologic therapy perioperative monitor tissue oxygen delivery . Hypoplastic leave heart syndrome ( HLHS ) represent extreme form complex congenital heart disease infant prolong cyanosis single systemic right ventricle . Staged palliation begin surgery neonatal period common approach infant HLHS . After initial surgical palliation , infant critically ill due ischemia/reperfusion injury cardiopulmonary bypass , coronary ischemia attribute diastolic runoff , reduce total ventricular mass , continue hypoxemia time increase metabolic demand , finally , inherent inefficiency parallel circulation . The presence one physiologic derangement place infant HLHS great risk ischemia , organ dysfunction , circulatory collapse , even , death . Postoperative monitoring venous oximetry , recently , near infrared spectroscopy , identify period impair oxygen delivery ischemia , allow intervention enhance oxygen delivery improve survival cardiac surgery . Although , apparent relationship exist oxygen delivery survival cardiac surgery , little data available relationship oxygen delivery neurodevelopmental outcome ( inclusive neurocognitive neuropsychologic outcome ) . Preliminary data center recently identify reduce venous oximetry associate adverse neurodevelopmental outcome . These initial finding warrant investigation neurologic injury , specifically , morbidity relates perioperative ischemia cerebral oxygen delivery . Hence , purpose study understand relationship perioperative tissue dysoxia long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity child subject oxygen delivery neurodevelopment compromise . Identification critical threshold may devastate child 's neurodevelopment quality life would allow early intervention , goal-directed therapy ultimately , improve outcome .</detailed_description>
