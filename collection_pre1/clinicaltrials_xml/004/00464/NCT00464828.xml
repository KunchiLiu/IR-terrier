	<detailed_description>There data regard success rate incidence carotid puncture central venous cannulation ( CVC ) pregnant patient . We hypothesize anatomical physiological change associate pregnancy , patient high risk procedure failure carotid puncture general population . The purpose study determine success rate incidence carotid puncture use ultrasound-simulated procedure pregnant non-pregnant patient . Pregnant patient adult female volunteer ( control ) recruit . Subjects place supine wedge right hip , head turn 35 degree leave . Two different approach CVC , central landmark palpatory approach use . The ease identification landmark note . CVC simulate use ultrasound probe , pre-marked point . Ultrasound image obtain , within parasagittal plane , direct 30 degree caudad , manner simulate syringe needle would place central venous cannulation . The investigator place probe blind image generate . The vertical cursor ultrasound , serve delineate path needle , place image . If cursor intersects vein , attempt consider successful . If first attempt successful , investigator place probe ask redirect probe second necessary third mark point . This do approach . If cursor intersects carotid artery , attempt consider accident attempt make . In addition determine success rate incidence carotid puncture , relative position vein artery study patient . For approach , best image record , three experience anesthesiologist score image vein artery degree overlapping .</detailed_description>
