	<brief_summary>Cystoid macular edema ( CME ) common cause suboptimal post-operative visual acuity uncomplicated cataract extraction . Over two million cataract extraction perform year , report incidence range 1.5 6.9 % , result estimate 20,000-130,000 new case CME annually . Clinical CME historically associate visual acuity 20/40 bad fluorescein angiographic evidence macular edema classic petaloid pattern . Angiographic CME physiologically signal inflammatory process cause distortion outer plexiform layer , resolve quickly could result non-repairable visual loss . Topical , periocular , intravitreal corticosteroid , despite associate side effect , mainstay pharmacologic treatment patient CME . Their efficacy never demonstrate randomize , control blind study . This open-label , Phase II study intravitreally administer ranibizumab subject cystoid macular edema secondary non-ischemic retinopathy , see follow cataract surgery intraocular lens implantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) know induced hypoxia implicate development iris retinal vascularization . VEGF , however , also know potent mediator vascular permeability tissue may perform function retina . Immunohistochemical VEGF stain identified patient disorder aphakic pseudophakic cystoid macular edema , ocular inflammatory disease infection . VEGF primarily localize within retinal neuron within retinal pigment epithelium case . In addition association role induce neovascularization ( Wet AMD diabetic retinopathy , VEGF may contribute breakdown blood-retinal barrier variety disorder . Ranibizumab pan-VEGF A blocker proven highly effective treatment wet macular degeneration . The underlie pathophysiology cystoid macular edema wet AMD VEGF overproduction . To date ranibizumab approve treat wet ARMD . In study explore ranibizumab treatment cystoid macular edema It hypothesize population show dramatic improvement initial cause VEGF production isolate surgical procedure due fact retinal pigment epithelium healthy population compare macular degeneration counterpart .</detailed_description>
