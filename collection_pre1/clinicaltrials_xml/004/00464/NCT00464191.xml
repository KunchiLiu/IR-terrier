	<brief_summary>Funding : An investigator-initiated trial fund H. Lundbeck AS . Study design : Prospective , randomised , placebo-controlled parallel-group multicenter study . Aim : To investigate efficacy side effect ( especially mood switch ) escitalopram , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , acute maintenance treatment bipolar depression . Hypotheses : 1 . Escitalopram , give addition mood stabilise medication , significantly efficacious , measure response remission rate placebo bipolar depression ( acute phase study ) . 2 . Continuation therapy escitalopram give significantly longer mean time depressive relapse fewer depressive relapse compare placebo ( continuation study ) . 3 . The incidence `` mood switching '' ( define development mixed episode , mania , hypomania accord DSM-IV criterion ) differ significantly escitalopram placebo either acute continuation phase . Patients : In- outpatient receive care specialise psychiatric service Western Norway . The population intend representative patient treat bipolar depression ordinary specialist care . Patients must MADRS score least 20 baseline . Patients ongoing substance abuse dependence , organic mental illness , non-affective psychotic symptom exclude . Medication : Escitalopram 10-20 mg daily placebo addition mood stabiliser . The dose mood stabiliser must constant last six week prior randomisation . Method : Phase 1 eight-week acute treatment trial six clinical assessment . Patients treat escitalopram responded eight week ( define least 50 % reduction MADRS score compare baseline ) leave study . Placebo non-responders treat openly escitalopram repeat phase 1 . Responders re-randomised 32 week maintenance treatment ( phase 2 ) . Phase 2 nine clinical assessment . Patients develop hypomania , mania depressive episode ( define episode meet DSM-IV criterion Major Depressive Episode MADRS score least 20 point ) leave study phase . Patients leave study prematurely offer alternative treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Escitalopram Bipolar Depression : Placebo-controlled Study Acute Maintenance Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims The study two main aim : 1 . To compare efficacy risk `` mood switching '' escitalopram placebo acute phase treatment bipolar depression patient already take mood stabilise medication . 2 . To compare efficacy escitalopram placebo continuation phase therapy bipolar depression use placebo-controlled discontinuation design . The study compare occurrence syndromal subsyndromal relapse , mixed state , mania , hypomania , `` rapid cycling '' seven month ' maintenance study follow response acute phase treatment . Hypotheses 1 . Escitalopram , give addition mood stabilise medication , significantly efficacious , measure response remission rate placebo bipolar depression ( acute phase study ) . 2 . Continuation therapy escitalopram give significantly longer mean time depressive relapse fewer depressive relapse compare placebo ( continuation study ) . 3 . The incidence `` mood switching '' ( define development mixed episode , mania , hypomania accord DSM-IV criterion differ significantly escitalopram placebo either acute continuation phase . Design This multi-center RCT parallel-group design . The study compare efficacy placebo escitalopram , give add-on mood stabilise medication patient bipolar depression without non-affective psychotic symptom accord DSM-IV , baseline MADRS score ≥ 20 point . The study two phase . The acute phase study last eight week compare efficacy escitalopram placebo depressive symptom bipolar depression . Response define least 50 % improvement MADRS compare baseline score . Responders escitalopram re-randomised escitalopram placebo continuation phase placebo responder continue take placebo continuation phase . Patients escitalopram respond acute phase leave study , whereas placebo non-responders treat openly escitalopram repeat phase 1 . Responders open-label treatment re-randomised double blind escitalopram placebo continuation study . The continuation phase study last 32 week . Patients respond placebo acute phase continue placebo usual mood stabilise medication remainder study . Those responded escitalopram re-randomised continue take placebo escitalopram unchanged dos . Patients develop new mood episode ( DSM-IV-defined major depressive episode , mania , hypomania , mixed episode ) MADRS score ≥ 20 point leave study . Method Screening include sociodemographic variable , medical psychiatric history , diagnosis make basis clinical interview verify MINI , symptom intensity measure MADRS , ) , result medical examination laboratory test ( ECG , height , weight , blood pressure blood test ) . Sociodemographic variable include age , gender , previous concomitant disorder , course treatment mental disorder , bipolar disorder type ( I II ) , age onset history psychotropic medication use . Study procedure As soon blood sample analyse , eligible patient randomise . They rat MADRS , Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) , Inventory Depressive Symptoms - Self Report ( IDS-SR ) , Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 ( SF-12 ) , Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) Sheehan Disability Inventory ( SDI ) baseline visit . Study medication dispense . The patient return visit show . Patients receive study medication maximum 40 week . Adverse event concomitant medication record . Assessments The following assessment carry : : 1 . MADRS , GAF , IDS-RS , CGI-I week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 34 40 2 . SDI QLDS week 8 40 3 . Diagnostic criterion Mania Hypomania week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 34 40 4 . Diagnostic criterion Major Depressive Episode week 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 34 40 For acute study , response remission rate assess MADRS primary outcome measure . CGI-Improvement IDS-SR secondary outcome measure . In continuation study , primary outcome measure include emergence major depressive episode mania/hypomania , time spend different depressive symptom level assess DSM-IV diagnostic criterion secondary outcome measure . Definitions Response : least 50 % reduction baseline MADRS score end phase 1 patient complete least four week study . CGI-I 1 2 end phase 1 . Remission : MADRS score 12 less end acute phase patient complete least four week study . New episode : A patient previously respond treatment meet DSM-IV criterion Major Depressive Episode . The patient must score least 15 point MADRS CGI-S score 3 episode . Mania hypomania : DSM-IV criterion .</detailed_description>
