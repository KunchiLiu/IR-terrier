	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive bronchitis chronic inflammatory disease airway , affect many 8 % individual industrialize nation . There increase number woman men suffer COPD . Pulmonary hypertension cor pulmonale common sequela chronic airflow obstruction , precise mechanism increase vascular resistance unclear . Potential cause pulmo-nary hypertension COPD include emphysematous destruction capillary bed , remodel pulmonary vessel hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction . This proposal , new immunomodulatory therapy COPD vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) evaluate . Based preliminary unpublished clinical experimental result , course disease VIP treatment molecular mechanism involve assessed . 34 patient severe COPD treat either VIP inhalation addition conventional therapy inhalation placebo plus conventional therapy period 3 month . The trial conduct double blind , comparative study two parallel group . In absence acute infection acute worsen disease due condition , 2 transbronchial biopsy collect treatment , 3 month treatÂ¬ment assessment regulation ) immune response , b ) extracellular matrix c ) epithelial growth . This assessment perform fully equip experienced laboratory University Vienna .</detailed_description>
