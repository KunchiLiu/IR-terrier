	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether GC1008 , antibody neutralizes TGF-beta , safe treat patient disease call focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . The high dose without excessive side effect investigate . Tests determine long GC1008 body excrete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study GC1008 Patients With Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) Single Doses GC1008 Patients With Treatment Resistant Idiopathic FSGS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cohort receive single dose GC1008 infusion 1 , 2 , 4 0.3 mg/kg body weight . The high dose cohort start first 28 day safety data low dose cohort review independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) . Cohort C D run concurrently patient randomise receive either 4 0.3 mg/kg body weight dose , respectively . After receive infusion GC1008 Day 0 , patient monitor 24 hour follow infusion . Patients return periodically follow 112 day safety evaluation clinical outcome assessment . Blood sample collect evaluate pharmacokinetics single dose administration GC1008 well evaluation marker clinical efficacy</detailed_description>
