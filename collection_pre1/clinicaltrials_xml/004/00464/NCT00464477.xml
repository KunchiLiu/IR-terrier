	<brief_summary>The Division Medical Genetics University Mississippi Medical Center recruit parent child pervasive developmental disorder ( include autism , autistic spectrum disorder , PDD-NOS , Asperger syndrome , childhood disintegrative disorder , Rett syndrome ) participate study help determine potential cause increase prevalence disorder . The study conduct use anonymous on-line survey available parent secure link . The study consist approximately 90 question affect child , sibling , parent , grandparent , take roughly 10-15 minute complete . Several family also invite participate phone interview . Both survey phone interview conduct use self-designated code protect anonymity patient privacy . No identify information name , date birth , address , phone number ask . Only question regard year birth family member ask .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Grandparental Age Risk Factor Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism genetically heterogeneous entity . Although numerous study demonstrate strong genetic basis , clear etiology identify date . Recently , two study demonstrate increase risk autism child bear father age 40 . However , give large male-to-female predominance autism , likely new mutation X chromosome account significant number affect case . Due maternal origin X chromosome male , hypothesize advanced maternal-grandpaternal age may also risk factor autism . Precedence theory exist X-linked disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy Rett syndrome . Additionally , demonstrate maternal psychiatric illness , paternal psychiatric illness , prevalent among parent child autism . Using anonymous survey family autistic child , seek identify age grandparent time parent bear order determine advance maternal-grandpaternal age associate increase risk autism adjust advance maternal paternal age . Additionally , seek sister-pairs order identify statistical significance age maternal grandfather delivery sister . If advanced maternal-grandpaternal age , fact , risk factor , would help direct molecular researcher towards gene X chromosome potential etiology autism . Also , study potential mutagenic exposure environment grandparent may help elucidate reason increase incidence autism recent decade .</detailed_description>
