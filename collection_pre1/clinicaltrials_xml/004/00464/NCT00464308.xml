	<brief_title>A Study Compare Number Patients With Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease ( GORD ) Achieving Heartburn Regurgitation Symptom Resolution After Treatment With Either Rabeprazole Sodium 20mg , Esomeprazole 20mg Esomeprazole 40mg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design conduct realistic General Practice ( GP ) setting , enrol typical Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease ( GORD ) patient present treatment , Proton Pump Inhibitor ( PPI ) would normally prescribe . The study conduct 4-week period basis current GP standard practice treat GORD patient period 4-weeks prior reassessment follow-up require . This study conduct patient GORD - associate heartburn ( without regurgitation ) multiple GP center , treatment assign base chance ( randomize ) , similar toss coin neither doctor patient know treatment receive ( double-blinded ) . Following screen determine eligibility , patient randomize receive oral treatment either , 20 mg rabeprazole , 20 mg esomeprazole 40 mg esomeprazole daily 4 week . This 4-week study encompass 2 protocol-mandated visit ( baseline day 0 final visit day 28 ) . It hypothesize rabeprazole 20 mg less effective ( non-inferior ) esomeprazole 40 mg degree GORD symptom resolution . Patients take one tablet ( rabeprazole 20 mg placebo ) one capsule ( esomeprazole 20 mg , esomeprazole 40 mg placebo ) day 28 day . The study medication take daily morning breakfast , except first dose , take Visit 1 .</detailed_description>
