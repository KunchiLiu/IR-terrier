	<brief_title>Accuracy Safety Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring Before , During After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Strict glycaemic control improve outcome critically ill patient . Real Time Continuous Glucose monitoring System ( RT-CGMS ) novel system provide health care professional real time information blood glucose level without need multiple invasive measurement . Furthermore , continuous monitor possible identify trend glycaemic profile . Its accuracy safety never test population patient admit intensive care unit . Objective : To investigate accuracy safety RT-CGMS patient schedule elective cardiac surgery . Our secondary objective define possible factor interfere reliable adequate glucose measurement investigate effect RT-CGMS glucose control . Study design : Open label , randomise control trial . Study population : Patients schedule elective cardiac surgery . Intervention : After inform consent randomisation , patient RT-CGMS inserted pre-operatively . In one group ( Control group ; 15 subject ) , RT-CGMS blind , information blood glucose value measure store RT-CGMS available care-givers , investigator patient study period . In group ( Active group , 15 subject ) , RT-CGMS blind . The system alert whenever glucose level fall rise preset value . Sensor value intend use directly make therapy adjustment . Whenever value preset value , blood glucose level measure use separate blood analysis therapy adjustment base value do accord ( ICU ) protocol . Study endpoint : Correlation data obtain RT-CGMS conventional method . Degree glucose control defined time spend normoglycaemia , hypoglycaemia hyperglycaemia , record sensor measurement ward measurement . Occurrence significant clinical event effect RT-CGMS .</detailed_description>
