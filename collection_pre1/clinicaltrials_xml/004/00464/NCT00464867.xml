	<brief_summary>Cholera major health problem many develop country mark increase prevalence see continent last decade ( WHO 1998 ) . There great need appropriate vaccine protect child principal suffers endemic country , live threaten consequence cholera . The B subunit-whole cell kill vaccine ( Dukoral ) develop Sweden use field trial world . It license many county world recommend WHO . Protective efficacy kill vaccine demonstrate adult Bangladesh well country , less child ( Clemens et al . 1986 ) . Thus urgency develop strategy improve immunogenicity vaccine especially protection child cholera endemic country world . Different option improve cholera vaccine consider include new improve formulation kill live oral candidate vaccine ( Qadri et al . 2004 , Sack et al . 1997 , Levine et al . 1993 ) well use micronutrient supplementation course immunization ( Albert et al . 2003 , Karlsen et al . 2003 , Qadri et al . 2004 ) . Another option appear promising use probiotic adjunct oral immunization base understanding agent could improve mucosal immune response , innate adaptive help reduce inflammation ( Blum Schiffrin 2003 , Fang et al . 2000 ) . A therapeutic well preventive role probiotic suggest result different study use different probiotic test , usually lactic acid produce bacteria lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium Steptococcus specie . The supplemention probiotic infant may also prophylactic effect acute diarrheal disease . In pediatric population , effect probiotic agent appear significant rotavirus diarrhea , suggest immunological mechanism responsible beneficial effect ( Saavedra , 2000 ) . In present proposal would like examine supplementation probiotic Bifidobacterium breve beneficial role enhance immunogenicity Dukoral child . A two cell study conduct one group child give B. breve every day four week another group give placebo . Two dose oral cholera vaccine administer two week interval follow initiation probiotic/placebo administration . Pre- post- vaccination blood sample collect assayed immune response vaccine . The frequency magnitude immune response vaccine compare among two group child ass whether probiotic treatment enhances immune response vaccine . If probiotic supplemenation positive effect immune response may adopt adjunct enhance efficacy cholera vaccine immunization programme perhaps also enteric vaccine .</brief_summary>
