	<detailed_description>Background The small bowel large blind spot gastrointestinal ( GI ) endoscopy , recently , small bowel accessible conventional endosocopes . Double-balloon enteroscopy ( DBE ) novel endoscopic procedure visualise entire small bowel . The method first describe Yamamoto et al . May et al 2001 2003 , respectively ( 1,2 ) . Since , DBE spread rise number centre around world . Both endoscopic diagnosis ( e.g . biopsy ) treatment easily perform use DBE . The first large series , recently publish , demonstrate DBE feasible scoping large part small bowel , total small intubation possible 30-40 % case ( 3,4 ) . In GI endoscopy procedure mandatory insufflate gas bowel secure good visualisation . All endoscope use GI endoscopy provide gas insufflation unit . The gas pump demand area examine endoscopist via gas tube incorporate endoscope . Currently , air use purpose 90 % centre throughout world . The use air , however , far ideal use insufflation GI endoscopy . After GI endoscopy , significant amount air usually retain bowel segment inspect ( 5 ) . This air pas GI tract exit physiologically rectum . Thus , abdominal pain discomfort examination due retention air show common endoscopic procedure ( 5-9 ) . Carbon dioxide gas ( CO2 ) , unlike air , rapidly absorb bowel . Within minute , several litre CO2 absorb GI tract . The use CO2 show result comfortable examination colonoscopy flexible sigmoidoscopy several randomise trial ( 6-9 ) . In study , CO2 insufflation almost completely reduced procedure-related pain discomfort . To knowledge , research perform investigate use CO2 DBE . DBE long-lasting procedure ( mean examination time 75 minute ( 4 ) ) . Large volume air insufflated procedure , lead significant distension small bowel examination . One main technical difficulty DBE formation small bowel loop scarp angels deep intubation endoscope . These loop angel major restriction deep intubation endoscope . Loops scarp angel pronounce air-distended bowel segment . The aim present study examine whether CO2 insufflation lead reduction abdominal pain DBE patient . Furthermore , want investigate CO2 insufflation facility deeper intubation endoscope thus complete examination small bowel mucosa . Hypothesis 1 . The use CO2 DBE lead reduction abdominal pain patient compare use air . 2 . The use CO2 DBE lead deep intubation compare air insufflation . Methods Study design The study design two-centre randomise control trial . The participate centre Rikshospitalet University Hospital , Oslo , Norway University Hospital Muenster , Germany . Randomisation two treatment group ( CO2 air insufflation ) perform basis individual participant . Equally large group randomise , use block randomisation ( block six patient ) participate centre . Randomisation ( use SPSS statistical software package ) perform independent researcher , part DBE team . Individuals eligible inclusion patient refer DBE trial centre fulfil one follow exclusion criterion : - Age 16 year - Inability understand information participation - Refusal participation All eligible individual inform nature study . All individual provide write informed consent enter trial . Patients wish participate present trial treat accord standard procedure ( use air insufflation ) . All procedure perform experienced endoscopists . Both patient endoscopists blind regard type gas use particular patient . Sedation perform accord current standard centre . Double-balloon procedure DBE perform use DBE endoscope system ( Fujinon Inc , Japan ) , describe literature ( 1-4 ) . The DBE endoscope consist 200-cm long video endoscope outer diameter 8.5 mm flexible overtube length 145 cm outer diameter 12 mm . Latex balloon attach endoscope overtube . These balloon inflate deflated insertion , describe elsewhere detail ( 1,2 ) . Gas insufflation CO2 insufflate use Fujinons equipment ( , specify ) Air insufflate use ordinary air inlet system endoscope rack . The air inlet button hidden view endoscopist prevent unblinding ( technical detail specify cooperation company ) . Evaluation pain discomfort A questionnaire use classify patient pain procedure . Visual analogue scale ( 100-mm ) use quantify abdominal pain examination 1 , 3 , 6 , 24 hour procedure , validate recent study ( 7,8 ) . The questionnaire give every participant procedure , fill next day , mail back respective trial centre use prepaid envelope . Evaluation ERCP examination parameter All procedure parameter interest ( e.g . duration , depth insertion , use sedative ) register endoscopist immediately examination use exist GI lab database . Ethics The regional ethic committee participate centre ask approval study protocol . Power analysis A 15 % reduction mean pain score VAS consider clinically important detect . There study available regard outcome DBE . Therefore , pilot study perform 20 included patient every group ( air/CO2 ) . The result pilot study estimate standard deviation need calculate power thus size study . Ownership Data own respective centre . Publication study result plan peer-reviewed journal . Michael Bretthauer Dirk Domagk co-ordinate study design , data generation analysis first manuscript draft . Michael Bretthauer Dirk Domagk first author plan publication , member study group co-authors . Budget All procedures present study perform ordinary patient , ordinary staff endoscopists . Therefore , extra cost occur personal . For purpose present study , however , technical equipment purchase ( specify ) . Financial funding need meeting study group prepay envelope . References 1 .

Gastrointest Endosc 2002 ; 56:190-4 Information consent Research study : Insuflation carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) double balloon enteroscopy Dear patient You hereby kindly invited participate research study undergo plan endoscopic investigation small bowel ( DBE , double balloon enteroscopy ) During examination , common practice insufflate gas small bowel provide examiner adequate view . At vast majority hospital around world , ordinary room air use insufflation . However , insufflate air produce pain abdominal discomfort patient hour examination . There evidence use carbon dioxide gas ( CO2 ) instead air reduce abdominal pain examination . In study , would like find true . Study participant divide random group receive CO2 DBE examination one group receive air . Both endoscopist patient know gas use . Only endoscopy assistant know type gas use examination . After examination , receive short questionnaire complaint discomfort , would like ask fill home mail back hospital . If decide participate study , examination perform use air insufflation ( standard method ) . The present study approve ethic committee . All information treat strictly confidential research purpose within study . Participation free charge mandatory . You may decline participation time . Yours sincerely Dr. med . Michael Bretthauer ( tlf : ) Written informed consent I hereby declare participation abovementioned research study . I aware participation voluntary .
