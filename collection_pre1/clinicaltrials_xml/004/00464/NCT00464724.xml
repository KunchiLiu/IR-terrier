	<brief_summary>Objectives : The objective study : 1 ) evaluate feasibility 3T MRSI prostate improve spectral resolution , use PFC-filled endorectal coil , 2 ) develop systematic metabolic grade system tumor detection identify abnormal peak area Cho , Cr , Po , Ci prostate carcinoma , specifically PFC-filled endorectal 3T MRSI , 3 ) evaluate efficacy metabolic grading system tumor detection . The long-term goal study provide early prognostic indicator mean monitor biologic status prostate cancer course disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part 1 : Prostate cancer tissue certain difference metabolism ( chemical makeup ) see normal tissue . MRSI type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use type scanner standard MRI . Unlike standard MRI , take picture body region , MRSI show metabolic feature prostate cell . MRSI exams use `` coil '' behind prostate ( inside rectum ) use measure metabolic feature prostate cancer tissue . This show improve accuracy find prostate tumor use standard scanner call `` 1.5T '' scanner . The coil work like antenna , air normally use inside coil inflate . The accuracy endorectal MRSI exam still need improvement . Use PFC instead air inside coil show greatly improve quality MRSI image 1.5T scanner . At first , researcher want learn new , strong ( 3T ) scanner improve quality endorectal MRSI exam combine PFC within coil . PFC clear odorless liquid , oppose air , physically similar human tissue ( prostate tissue ) . This make MRSI image much clear . If agree take part study ( Part 1 ) find eligible , 2 MRSI exam ( one air one PFC ) use endorectal coil . Before inserted , coil inflate air check possible leak . You lie one side , inside 3T MRI scanner , coil ( covered protective nonlatex latex ) insert rectum . Having coil insert similar enema tip insert . The coil fill air , lie back first MRSI exam complete . Once first MRSI exam complete , much air possible remove coil use syringe . The coil fill PFC , second MRSI exam repeat manner . At end exam , PFC remove manner , coil remove rectum . There direct contact PFC air inside coil body . In total , 2 MRSI study take 60 minute . You prostatectomy ( surgical removal prostate ) within 3 month MRSI exam perform . After operation , participation study . This investigational study . The 3T scanner , software , hardware use study FDA-approved use clinical practice . The use air endorectal coil standard procedure . PFC yet approve use endorectal MRSI exam . MRSI scan commercially available FDA-approved routine clinical care . Up 80 patient ( 40 part study 40 Part 2 ) take part study . All enrol MD Anderson . Part 2 : Prostate cancer tissue certain difference metabolism ( chemical makeup ) see normal tissue . MRSI type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use type scanner standard MRI . Unlike standard MRI , take picture anatomy ( body region ) , MRSI show metabolic feature prostate . MRSI exams use `` coil '' behind prostate ( inside rectum ) use measure metabolic feature prostate cancer tissue . This show improve accuracy prostate tumor detection standard scanner call `` 1.5T '' scanner . The coil work like antenna , air normally use inside coil inflate .

At first , researcher want learn new , strong ( 3T ) scanner improve quality endorectal MRSI exam combine PFC within coil . PFC clear odorless liquid , oppose air , physically similar human tissue ( prostate tissue ) . This make MRSI image much clear . If agree take part study ( Part 2 ) find eligible , MRSI exam PFC use endorectal coil . Only PFC use . Before inserted , coil inflate air check possible leak , much possible air remove . You lie one side , inside 3T MRI scanner , coil ( covered protective nonlatex latex ) insert rectum . Having coil insert similar enema tip insert . The coil fill PFC , lie back MRSI exam complete . Once exam complete , PFC remove coil use syringe coil remove rectum . There direct contact PFC inside coil body . The procedure take 30 minute . You prostatectomy ( surgical removal prostate ) within 3 month MRSI exam perform . After operation , participation study . This investigational study . The 3T scanner , software , hardware use study FDA-approved use clinical practice . PFC yet approve use endorectal MRSI exam . MRSI scan commercially available FDA-approved routine clinical care . Up 80 patient ( 40 second part study 40 Part 1 ) take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
