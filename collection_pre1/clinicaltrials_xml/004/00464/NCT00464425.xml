	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus remain significant medical problem colorectal surgery adversely influence patient ' recovery prolongs hospital stay . In fact , substantial portion overall hospitalisation period colorectal surgery attribute time take ileus resolve . Different treatment modality include thoracic epidural analgesia , pharmacological therapy , early enteral feeding , early mobilisation attempt , none establish role specific remedy postoperative ileus . Although laparoscopic colorectal surgery proven associate good short-term clinical outcome include faster return gastrointestinal function open surgery , duration postoperative ileus laparoscopic arm still report long 4 day ( 1 day earlier open arm ) randomise trial . Additional measure thus necessary enhance gastrointestinal recovery laparoscopic colorectal surgery order maximise benefit , acupuncture may one option . Acupuncture widely accept China well throughout world effective treatment option management postoperative nausea vomit various functional gastrointestinal disorder . Its role treat postoperative ileus , however , less clear , data Chinese well Western literature scarce . Besides , heterogeneity study design flaw methodology report study make interpretation data difficult . Results present study provide evidence-based clarification role acupuncture treat postoperative ileus laparoscopic colorectal surgery . If hypothesis proven correct substantiate study , incorporation electroacupuncture fast-track recovery programme laparoscopic , open , even emergency colorectal surgery consider . As laparoscopic colorectal surgery show higher direct cost open counterpart , faster postoperative recovery may help reduce financial burden hospital improve cost-effectiveness procedure . Patients enrol study inclusion exclusion criterion satisfy laparoscopic surgery . Randomisation do shortly surgery . Patients randomise receive either electroacupuncture ( EA group ) , sham acupuncture ( SA group ) , acupuncture ( NA group ) . The medical acupuncturist individual aware treatment allocation ; patient EA SA group blind treatment . The patient randomise EA SA group undergo 1 session acupuncture daily postoperative day 1 till day 4 . Adverse event associated acupuncture include bleeding , dizziness , excessive pain , allergic reaction closely monitor . The acupuncture needle immediately withdrawn event occur . The postoperative management patient standardise . Pethidine 1mg/kg postoperative analgesia give every 4-hourly demand . Early ambulation encourage . Oral feeding resume soon gastrointestinal function return clinically ( nausea vomiting , abdominal distension , passage flatus stool ) . No gum chew allow . Patients discharge tolerate diet fully ambulatory .</detailed_description>
