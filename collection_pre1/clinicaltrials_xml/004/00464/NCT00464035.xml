	<brief_title>The Effect Calcium Postprandial Lipid Profile Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several report find inverse association calcium intake body weight . Intervention study show high calcium diet result great body weight loss low calcium diet . In addition , seem calcium dairy product profound effect calcium supplement . The mechanism additional dairy effect yet clear , one possible explanation could reduce absorption fat gut . The increase fecal fat excretion high calcium diet could due formation calcium-fatty acid soap gut . The long term effect high calcium intake intense investigation , far know acute effect high calcium intake yet examine . A study concern acute effect could help u understand effect calcium absorption fat . After meal triglyceride ( TG ) package cholesterol , lipoproteins lipid particle call chylomicron . Earlier study show fatty acid pattern chylomicron lipid postprandial similar ingest fat . If assume calcium inhibits absorption fat , would expect reduce total plasma triglyceride concentration calcium-rich meal . Appetite involve many different sensation among hunger satiety investigate . Several different hormone involve regulation appetite . Some hormone know respond intake absorption fat . If absorption fat inhibit regulation appetite likely affect . In long term could important increase appetite probably would increase energy intake thereby reduce weight loss otherwise might accomplish reduce absorption fat .</detailed_description>
