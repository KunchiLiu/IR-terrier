	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate evolution memory deficit ( verbal episodic memory , procedural memory , work memory , short-term memory ) Sleep Apnea Obstructive Syndrome ( SAOS ) patient treatment Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment ( CPAP ) . For thus , compare memory test two separate group SAOS patient `` effective `` versus `` ineffective '' ( sham ) CPAP , 6 week begin treatment . Thus assess evolution memory deficit , effectiveness treatment evolution memory deficit 6 week begin treatment `` effective `` versus `` ineffective '' CPAP . We feel result test memory show great memory disorder patient SAOS begin treatment rather six week afterwards . Thus hypothesise , treatment `` effective '' CPAP , patient SAOS great improvement memory disorder treat `` sham CPAP '' .</brief_summary>
