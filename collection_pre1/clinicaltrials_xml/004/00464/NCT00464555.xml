	<brief_title>Strategies Improve Islet Survival</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes commonly treat administration insulin , either multiple insulin injection continuous supply insulin wearable pump . Insulin therapy allow long-term survival individual type 1 diabetes ; however , guarantee constant normal blood sugar control . As result , long-term type 1 diabetic survivor often develop vascular complication , diabetic retinopathy , eye disease cause poor vision blindness , diabetic nephropathy , kidney disease lead kidney failure . Some individual type 1 diabetes develop hypoglycemia unawareness , life-threatening condition easily treatable medication characterize reduced absent warning signal hypoglycemia . For individual , pancreas pancreatic islet transplantation possible treatment option . Unfortunately , insulin independence among islet transplant recipient tend decline time . New strategy aim promote engraftment transplant islet need improve clinical outcome associated procedure . The purpose study determine safety efficacy islet transplantation , combine immunosuppressive medication regimen contain lisofylline ( LSF ) . This regimen intend treat type 1 diabetes individual experience hypoglycemia unawareness severe hypoglycemic episode . This study also seek improve understanding determinant success failure islet transplant type 1 diabetes . Eligible participant randomly assign study Phase 3 islet transplantation study ( DAIT CIT-07 ) . Participants assign study receive LSF . Participants study receive three separate islet transplant regimen immunosuppressive medication include antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) first transplant , sirolimus , tacrolimus , LSF support engraft islet beta-cell mass . All participant begin receive ATG sirolimus 2 day prior transplantation . ATG continue 2 day post-transplant . Sirolimus continue duration study . All participant also receive tacrolimus start one day post-transplant continue duration study . Basiliximab use place ATG subsequent transplant . Participants LSF group begin receive LSF one day prior transplant continue receive LSF 5 day post-transplant . Transplantations involve inpatient hospital stay infusion islet branch portal vein . Participants achieve maintain insulin independence Day 75 post-transplant consider second islet transplant . Participants remain dependent insulin longer 1 month second transplant show partial graft function consider third islet transplant . Basiliximab use place ATG second third transplant , necessary . Participants meet criterion subsequent transplant function graft enter reduce follow-up period . There approximately 15 study visit follow transplant . A physical exam , review adverse event , blood collection occur visit . A chest x-ray , abdominal ultrasound , electrocardiogram , quality life questionnaire , urine collection , glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) test occur visit . Participants also test blood glucose level least five time per day throughout study . A 24-month follow-up period take place participant 's last transplant .</detailed_description>
