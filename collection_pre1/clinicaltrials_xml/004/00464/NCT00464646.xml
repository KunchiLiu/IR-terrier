	<brief_title>Therapy With Bevacizumab ( BEV ) , Epirubicin , Cyclophosphamide Followed Docetaxel Plus Trastuzumab BEV Given Neoadjuvant Adjuvant Therapy Women With Locally Advanced HER2 Positive Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NSABP FB-5 Phase II study woman HER2-positive invasive breast cancer evaluate regimen epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide follow docetaxel plus trastuzumab bevacizumab two patient cohort : - Cohort A : Women unresected locally advanced breast cancer ( clinical Stage IIIA , IIIB , IIIC ) - Cohort B : Women resect pN2 pN3 ( pathologic Stage III ) breast cancer . The primary aim study determine rate cardiac event patient pCR rate breast axillary lymph node Cohort A. Cardiac event define NYHA Class III/IV congestive heart failure cardiac death . For Cohort A , secondary aim study include determine rate pCR breast cCR rate follow neoadjuvant therapy . The secondary aim also include determine value regimen improve 5-year RFS 5-year OS determine non-cardiac toxicity regimen patient . Patients Cohort A receive neoadjuvant therapy consist epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide ( EC ) every 21 day 4 cycle plus bevacizumab give Day 1 Cycle 4 , follow docetaxel every 21 day 4 cycle plus bevacizumab every 21 day initial 3 cycle . Patients also receive weekly trastuzumab begin first cycle docetaxel continue 1-7 day surgery . Patients breast surgery ( lumpectomy mastectomy ) axillary staging . Approximately 4-6 week follow surgery , bevacizumab trastuzumab resume continue every 3 week 13 dos complete one year target therapy . Patients Cohort B receive adjuvant therapy consist EC every 21 day 4 cycle follow docetaxel every 21 day 4 cycle . Beginning first cycle docetaxel , patient also receive bevacizumab every 21 day 4 cycle weekly trastuzumab 3 week last docetaxel dose . Beginning 3 week last dose docetaxel , bevacizumab trastuzumab give every 3 week 13 dos complete 1 year target therapy . Cardiac monitoring conduct cohort . For Cohort A , LVEF assessment conduct baseline , post-EC , 2-4 week follow surgery ( 6 month study entry ) , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 month study entry . For Cohort B , LVEF assessment conduct baseline , post-EC , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 month study entry . The preferred method LVEF assessment 2-D echocardiogram ; however , LVEF assessment MUGA scan permit . Patient follow-up continue 5 year follow study entry . The FB-5 sample size 105 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Conditions eligibility patient LABC ( Cohort A ) : The diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast must make core needle biopsy limit incisional biopsy . Patients must clinical Stage IIIA , IIIB , IIIC disease mass breast axilla great equal 2.0 cm measure clinical exam , unless patient inflammatory breast carcinoma , case measurable disease require . Conditions eligibility patient resect Stage III breast cancer ( Cohort B ) Patients must undergo either total mastectomy lumpectomy . Patients must complete one follow procedure evaluation pathologic nodal status . Sentinel lymphadenectomy follow removal additional nonsentinel lymph node , Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure . The interval last surgery ( breast cancer treatment stag ) study entry must 84 day . By pathologic evaluation , ipsilateral node must pN2 pN3 . For patient undergo lumpectomy , margin resect specimen must histologically free invasive tumor DCIS determine local pathologist . If pathologic examination demonstrate tumor line resection , additional operative procedure may perform obtain clear margin . If tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) , patient must undergo total mastectomy eligible . ( Patients margin positive LCIS eligible without additional resection . ) For patient undergo mastectomy , margin must free gross residual tumor . Patients microscopic positive margin eligible . Conditions patient eligibility ( ALL patient ) The patient must consent participate must sign date IRBapproved consent form conform federal institutional guideline . Patients must female . The patient must great equal 18 year old . The patient 's ECOG performance status must 0 1 . The tumor must invasive adenocarcinoma breast histologic examination . The breast cancer must determine HER2positive prior study entry . Assays perform use FISH require gene amplification . Assays use IHC require strongly positive ( 3+ ) stain score . At time study entry , blood count must meet following criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great than/equal 1200/mm3 . Platelet count must great than/equal 100,000/mm3 . Hemoglobin must great than/equal 10 g/dL . The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function must meet : total bilirubin must less than/equal ULN lab unless patient grade 1 bilirubin elevation ( great ULN 1.5 x ULN ) due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ; alkaline phosphatase must less 2.5 x ULN lab ; AST must less than/equal 1.5 x ULN lab . Alkaline phosphatase AST may great ULN . For example , alkaline phosphatase great ULN less than/equal 2.5 x ULN , AST must less than/equal ULN . If AST great ULN less than/equal 1.5 x ULN , alkaline phosphatase must less than/equal ULN . Patients AST alkaline phosphatase great ULN eligible inclusion study liver image ( CT , MRI , PET scan ) demonstrate metastatic disease , adequate hepatic function . Patients either skeletal pain alkaline phosphatase great ULN less than/equal 2.5 x ULN eligible inclusion study bone scan PET scan demonstrate metastatic disease . Patients suspicious finding bone scan PET scan eligible suspicious finding confirm benign xray , MRI , biopsy . Serum creatinine less than/equal ULN lab .
