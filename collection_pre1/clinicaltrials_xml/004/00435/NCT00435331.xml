	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether addition sapropterin dihydrochloride ( 6R-BH4 ) exist treatment effect patient pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Patients PAH low level substance call nitric oxide ( NO ) . Tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) substance produce body essential requirement formation NO . NO think helpful keep blood vessel lung healthy . 6R-BH4 experimental ( unproven ) medicine make lab much like BH4 body make . The researcher investigate whether 6R-BH4 add safely current treatment PAH whether evidence benefit use . The study take approximately one year complete time recruitment begin . The primary objective study evaluate safety oral 6R-BH4 , administer escalate dos addition standard care , subject pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . The secondary objective study evaluate change biochemical marker endothelial dysfunction nitric oxide synthetase activity ( couple uncouple ) subject PAH receive escalate dos oral 6R-BH4 addition standard care . The third objective study evaluate change biomarkers disease progression , 6-minute walk ( 6MW ) distance , Borg dyspnea score , quality life ( QOL ) measure subject PAH receive escalate dos oral 6R-BH4 addition standard care .</brief_summary>
