	<brief_summary>Background : - In woman , HPV infection cause symptom infection go away . In small percentage woman , HPV infection go away sometimes result cervical precancer cancer . - There several different type HPV . A well understand type related cervical precancer cancer may help guide doctor clinical management woman test positive HPV well understand woman develop disease others . Objectives : - To determine whether certain type HPV risky others , whether warrant separate detection screen cervical precancer cancer . - To determine lasting infection different HPV type carry different risk cervical precancer cancer . - To determine viral genetic factor influence development cervical precancer cancer . - To evaluate new HPV test new biomarkers cervical cancer risk . Eligibility : -Women 30 year age old cervical cancer screen program Kaiser Permanente health plan Northern California . Women test positive HPV random sample woman test negative virus include . Design : - Data participant genetic background type carcinogenic HPV infect analyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The carcinogenicity 15 HPV type carcinogenic potential varies greatly . We wish clarify clinical utility carcinogenic HPV DNA test woman 21 old understanding unique property individual HPV genotypes viral persistence progression . Specifically , seek understand timing determinant viral clearance versus persistence , give persistence , risk progression CIN3/cancer ( great equal CIN3 ) among woman infect type carcinogenic HPV genotype age cancer occur . The relevant natural history data lacking . There NCI cohort question adequately address . Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( KPNC ) routinely use FDA-approved pooled-HPV genotype DNA test carcinogenic HPV ( Hybrid Capture 2 [ HC2 ] , Qiagen Corporation , Gaithersburg , MD ) adjunct cytology cervical cancer screen woman 30 old triage immediate colposcopy woman equivocal Pap result age . We team KPNC create carcinogenic HPV-positive cohort ( HPV Persistence Progression Cohort PaP Cohort ) investigate natural history HPV genotype . Specifically , store approximately 60,000 baseline specimen follow sub-populations : 1 ) approximately 40,000 HPV positive random population sample 4,000 baseline specimen woman age 30 year old ; 2 ) approximately 5,000 HPV-orcytology-positives random population sample 2,000 baseline specimen woman age 25-29 year age ; 3 ) approximately 5,000 HPV-or cytology-positives random population sample 2,000 baseline specimen woman age 21-24 year age . We use efficient sample design achieve high power minimal laboratory analysis , specimen select test base clinical outcome ascertain linkage Kaiser cytology histology databases KPNC active yearly follow-up HC2-positive woman . We plan `` follow '' woman three year enrollment 2007-8 banking residual specimen collect return visit ; long follow-up would likely bias extensive censoring due treatment . Extremely low-cost specimen accrual , computerized follow-up use KPNC database , leveraged funding make cohort highly cost-effective , propose budget $ 1,030,954 5 year . The de novo cost screen population identify approximately 50,000 HPV-positive woman 21 old , perform KPNC part routine screen cost u , approximately $ 50 million . The clinical follow-up , cytology , histologic diagnosis cost million . We obtain genotyping variant test without cost Division Cancer Epidemiology Genetics ( DCEG ) , via collaboration aforementioned Cooperative Agreement . The major cost personnel save handle specimen , extraction clinical questionnaire data , offer woman whose specimen bank opt-out use specimen .</detailed_description>
