	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate mechanism autoantibody production chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . 10-50 % individual HCV symptom mixed cryoglobulinemia ( MC ) . By study B cell HCV-infected individual without MC , well healthy control , hope gain insight mechanism autoantibody production develop new strategy treatment MC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infect approximately 170 million people worldwide . About 10-50 % person HCV MC . MC associate development autoimmune symptom B cell proliferative disorder . We plan study B cell individual chronically infect HCV well healthy control . We sort B cell different type , analyze type differential level gene expression . We test hypothesis certain type B cell subject MC increase expression gene allow increase cell survival . People interested participate study complete history general medical examination begin study . Following screening , procedure call leukapheresis , white blood cell remove , red blood cell return . The procedure take approximately 3 hour similar blood donation . The leukapheresis do day admission hospital outside blood collection company train nurse certified equipment . Some aspect study experimental mean fluid cell collect studied analyzed determine precisely body 's immune system respond virus . These test experimental part usual routine care patient .</detailed_description>
