	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine penetration continuously infused antibiotic steady state , mainly Meropenem , Vancomycin , Linezolid , Piperacillin/tazobactam additionally cefepim ceftazidim , epithelial lining fluid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steady State Serum Epithelial Lining Fluid ( ELF ) Antibiotics Concentrations Under Continous Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe infectious disease may cause admit patient ICU , often constitute complication intensive care turn cause nosocomial pathogen . Nosocomial infection associate high lethality . The appropriate antibiotic therapy determines part outcome patient . Especially antibiotic therapy implicate number problem physician . He ensure choose antibiotic effective common presume pathogen reach concentration antibiotic plasma epithelial lining fluid reliably permanently minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) give pathogen . All antibiotic include clinical trial call `` time dependent '' antibiotic . They effective concentration reach certain level ( MIC ) infect site ( epithelial lining fluid study ) entire period treatment . To achieve aim , many author already suggest continuous infusion might solve problem low antibiotic plasma ELF level . Studies pharmacokinetics continuous infused antibiotic , conduct healthy volunteer patient normal organ function , assign critical ill patient . Rationales statement data plasma tissue level antibiotic critical ill patient highly influenced modify volume distribution , elimination half-life period impair tissue perfusion compare healthy volunteer . These physiological variance implicate response antibiotic treatment remain doubtful . Under pathophysiological condition , data antibiotic plasma ELF level may provide additional information order adjust dose regime antibiotic . Studies conduct critical ill patient show circumstance continuous infused antibiotic , reach level plasma MIC . However little data penetration ELF continuous infuse antibiotic . Our study intend provide data plasma ELF level continuous infused antibiotic steady state , determine penetration coefficient antibiotic ELF compare reach level ELF MIC . To demonstrate efficiency continuous infused antibiotic , conduct quantitative microbiological measurement treatment applicable .</detailed_description>
