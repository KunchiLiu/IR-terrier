	<brief_summary>This human trial study peripheral effect therapeutic botulinum toxin ( botox-A ) . The trial perform healthy normal male . The study comprise two parallel placebo-controlled , double blind study . In experiment 1 intramuscular Botox give corrugator ( one site ) frontalis ( two site ) muscle one side placebo side . Intradermal ( i.d . ) capsaicin injection give side ( two site frontalis injection horizontally ) . Capsaicin-induced pain intensity flare together area hypersensitivity different stimulus modality measure map specific time point use different cutaneous stimulus ( thermal , electrical , tactile , pressure ) . This characterize fibres receptor affect Botox show Botox unilateral effect ( peripheral ) also affect contralateral side ( central effect ) . In experiment 2 intradermal Botox give corrugator ( one site ) frontalis ( two site ) muscle one side placebo side . I.d . capsaicin injection give side ( two site frontalis injection horizontally ) . Capsaicin-induced pain intensity flare together area hypersensitivity different stimulus modality measure map specific time point use different cutaneous stimulus ( thermal , electrical , tactile , pressure ) . This characterize fibres receptor affect Botox . The effect intradermal Botox compare result experiment 1 . The two experiment show intramuscular Botox exert action via leak Botox muscle overlie skin . Antipruritic effect Botox histamine prick test itch also assess parallel experiment 2 . In sub-experiment , 5 Units Botox inject intradermally middle volar forearm . The volume placebo injected side . Histamine prick test induce itch effect intradermal Botox assess compare baseline . Flare area visual analogue scale ( VAS ) rating measure .</brief_summary>
