	<brief_title>Pilot Study Feasibility Palm Pilots Monitoring Smoking Behavior Individuals With Chronic Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim project : 1 . We compare accuracy daily palm pilot recording paper pencil measure . We hypothesize number cigarette smoke accord daily palm pilot recording correlate well salivary cotinine level ( metabolite nicotine ) daily paper pencil recording . That , expect palm recording accurate paper pencil recording . 2 . We compare total number smoke cigarette report daily rating ( paper pencil palm pilot ) participant ' report weekly total . We expect participant tend underestimate number cigarette smoke asked report weekly total . That , hypothesize participant report smoke few cigarette weekly total compare daily report smoke total base daily report correlate strongly cotinine level . 3 . We measure frequency participant access screen Palm Pilot present `` 4 D 's , '' four strategy delay reduce cigarette use . Participants ask access screen experience urge smoke . We hypothesize least participant make use screen . 4 . We assess effect daily monitoring salivary cotinine level . Smoking reduction specific goal program . However , participant access 4D 's coach screen Palm urge may reduce smoke . We hypothesize reduction cotinine level correlate great frequency access 4 D 's screen . That , participant access 4D 's screen often ( 5 time per day ) expect show reduction cotinine level compare baseline participant access 4 D 's screen 5 . We measure participant ' level satisfaction Palm Pilot paper pencil version monitoring form . We hypothesize participant report high level satisfaction Palm Pilot version , high high level satisfaction paper pencil version . 6 . We assess whether participant able complete rating scale Palm Pilot . We hypothesize participant able complete scale . 7 . We assess amount train time require train participant use either paper pencil Palm Pilot version monitor form . Methods Procedures : Ten participant come four , 45-minute assessment , total 3 hour , 3-week period . At visit , smoke behavior assess use either palm pilot paper pencil recording carbon monoxide salivary cotinine measure . Training provide use palm participant `` trial '' record data actual data record . In addition , week participant use Palm Pilots , ask come clinic mid-week visit Palm Pilot charge sync computer . No assessment complete mid-week visit . Subjects serve control study . Participants ask keep track smoke answer question smoke use two format : paper pencil form form program Palm Pilots . For Palm Pilot recording , participant loan Palm Pilot use answer question smoke whenever smoke . Palm record paper pencil recording compare salivary cotinine carbon monoxide level . To control effect one data collection strategy use , subject randomize either paper pencil recording palm recording first . We also teach client basic behavioral strategy ( `` four D 's '' ) cut amount cigarette smoke . The four D 's stand 1 ) deep breathing , 2 ) drink fluid , 3 ) delay , 4 ) something else . The paper Palm Pilot version questionnaires include reminder four D 's encourage participant cut amount cigarette smoke per day . In addition , participant ask fill Hughes-Hatsukami Scale , measure nicotine withdrawal symptom . In summary , participant take part following : 1 . Assessment 1 : Baseline assessment ( week 0 ) include self report cigarette smoke past week , measure salivary cotinine level , expire air carbon monoxide level . The four D 's strategy cut number cigarette smoke introduce . 2 . For Week 1 , subject ask keep daily paper-and-pencil record smoke behavior week follow baseline . Subjects ask report number cigarette smoke , time day smoke , felt smoke , degree crave cigarette . They also ask indicate whether tried four D 's strategy avoid delay smoking . Additionally , fill Hughes-Hatsukami Scale per day . 3 . Assessment 2 : Subjects return assessment end week paper pencil recording . Salivary cotinine carbon monoxide level measure time . Additionally , subject fill satisfaction questionnaire regard satisfaction paper-and-pencil method monitoring smoking . 4 . Subjects train record smoking behavior use Palm Pilot version record form . Subjects loan Palm Pilot program present computerized version smoke behavior monitor form use make paper pencil recording . Subjects ask hit button Palm Pilot whenever urge smoke , complete recording Palm Pilot manner paper-and-pencil recording . However , Palm Pilots set beep 1x per day ( participant 's state wake-up time ) prompt participant make summary recording number cigarette per day complete Hughes-Hatsukami Scale . Additionally , morning questionnaire include reminder screen encourage participant make recording practice four D 's . Subjects practice use Palm Pilot Week 2 . 5 . Mid-week visit 1 : Participants return clinic middle week charge hot-sync ( synchronize computer ) Palm Pilot . No assessment occur visit . 6 . Assessment 3 : Subjects return week practice . Salivary cotinine carbon monoxide level measure , well smoke withdrawal symptom . 7 . Subjects ask record smoking palm pilot another week ( Week 3 ) . 8 . Mid-week visit 2 : Participants return clinic middle week charge hot-sync ( synchronize computer ) Palm Pilot . No assessment occur visit . 9 . Assessment 4 : Subjects return fourth final assessment cotinine carbon monoxide level . Subjects also complete satisfaction questionnaire regard experience use Palm Pilot version monitoring .</detailed_description>
