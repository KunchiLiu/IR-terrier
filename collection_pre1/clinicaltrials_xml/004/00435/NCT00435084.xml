	<brief_summary>This phase I/II study design determine safety tolerability APO866 treatment refractory B-CLL amenable aHSCT . APO866 show induce growth inhibition culture wide variety human hematological malignant cell well model subcutaneously implant human tumor . APO866 consider safe well-tolerated phase I study treat 24 patient advanced cancer . APO866 administer intravenous infusion continuously 96 hour repeat every 4 week . In study patient receive one cycle treatment study endpoint evaluate 4 week start infusion . Patients follow 12 week safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Assess Safety Tolerability APO866 Treatment Refractory B-CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>B-CLL one common type leukemia , remain incurable , limited therapeutic option available include alkylating agent fludarabine . The identification new , selective , non-toxic form therapy patient B-CLL therefore high priority . APO866 novel drug induces cell death specifically inhibit biosynthesis NAD+ niacinamide , essential cellular metabolism , protein modification messenger synthesis . APO866 subject commonly know mechanism MDR . Its activity cell cycle independent . APO866 exert high anti-tumor activity broad range different tumor cell derive human solid cancer leukemias vitro , include CD38- CD38+ cell line , large number human xenograft nude mice rat vivo . Hematologic cancer cell highly sensitive APO866 ( low 6 nM ) . Lymphocytes sensitive normal cell APO866 result lymphocytopenia reticulocytopenia rat monkey . Furthermore , APO866 may anti-angiogenic property show vivo dose-dependent decrease VEGF level patient treat phase I study . It unclear CD38 positivity associate short patient survival poor responsiveness chemotherapy . It possible CD38 expression confers B-CLL malignant cellular phenotype . This seem plausible give antigen important role modulator intracellular signal cross-linking CD38 up-regulates BCL-2 inhibits apoptosis normal mature B cell . Indeed , CD38/CD3l interaction lead increase B-CLL proliferation survival . This study design recruit patient progressive refractory B-CLL , line literature , 50 % CD38+ . We hypothesize CD38+ lymphocytes sensitive APO866 therapy due increase intracellular NAD+ consumption substrate PARP dependent DNA repair ( instable genome , proliferation ) . However , CD38+ CD38- B-CLL cell seem equally sensitive APO866 vitro . In addition , decrease intracellular NAD+ level reduce anabolism cADPR . CD38+ catalyze synthesis cADPR NAD+ hydrolyze cADPR ADP-ribose.85,86,87 The cADPR potent Ca++-mobilizing activator potential endogenous regulator.88 The ability cADPR release Ca++ intracellular pool think part CD38-mediated signalling pathway result cell growth , apoptosis , differentiation . APO866 investigate 24 patient advanced cancer phase I study aim determine DLT MTD . Treatment well tolerate safe . The unique DLT thrombocytopenia . At dose level higher 0.036 mg/m2/hr CTC grade III lymphocytopenia , think clinically relevant , preceded toxicity . The recommend dose phase II study APO866 0.126 mg/m2/hr administer civ infusion 4 consecutive day every 4 week . This dose select safety profile , translational observation Css APO866 MTD similar high compare concentration efficacy establish vitro vivo . In addition , transient decrease serum VEGF level , surrogate marker angiogenesis , observe within 96 hrs start treatment 9 11 patient treat MTD 0.144 mg/m2/hr dose level APO866 This form rationale conduct `` Proof concept '' study APO866 , administer recommend dose patient progressive refractory B-CLL non-eligible aHSCT , either CD38- CD38+ .</detailed_description>
