	<detailed_description>Developing objective methodology assess technical skill paramount superior surgical training . Alternatives traditional apprenticeship model surgical training necessary today 's emphasis cost containment professional competency . Metrics widely employ virtual environment provide yardstick performance measurement . The current method define metric medical simulation remain art science . Many study demonstrate trainee practice laparoscopic skill simulate environment improve mastery skill test environment . Fewer study able document learn curve mastery task virtual reality simulator . This study investigate learn curve task virtual reality laparoscopic simulator .</detailed_description>
