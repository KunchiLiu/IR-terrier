	<brief_summary>In France , 3,700 new case thyroid cancer diagnose year . Differentiated thyroid carcinoma represent 90 % thyroid cancer ; 10-year survival 90-95 % patient . This favorable prognosis result effective primary therapy , consist total thyroidectomy follow radio-iodine ablation 3,7GBq ( 100mCi ) case significant risk persistent disease . Few center investigate possibility administer low dose 131I ( 1GBq , 30 mCi ) , order limit potential long-term adverse complication patient respond radioprotection rule family member medical staff . Radio-iodine ablation require TSH stimulation , historically achieve thyroid hormone withdrawal 3 5 week . During period , patient suffer symptom hypothyroidism . The recombinant human TSH ( rhTSH , Thyrogen® , Genzyme Therapeutics , Cambridge , USA ) approve Europe 2005 alternative stimulation procedure withdrawal ablation . It allow patient remain euthyroid thyroid hormone therapy ( needs withdrawn ) . However , costly drug ( 800 € per patient ) , whose economic efficiency need check .</brief_summary>
