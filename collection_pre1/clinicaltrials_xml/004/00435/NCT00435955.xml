	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether intensified treatment plus Rituximab follow autologous transplantation superior conventional chemotherapy regimen also supplement Rituximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison High-Dose Chemotherapy + Rituximab CHOP + Rituximab High-Risk Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The place intensify regimen autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) poorly define FL diagnosis . Most data arise study perform pre-Rituximab age . According study , ASCT improve overall survival versus standard salvage approach relapse patient high proportion patient achieve durable molecular remission . Data diagnosis less clear . Three study far publish contradictory result . Two study show intensive therapy ensure good disease control although one study significant extra-mortality secondary tumor observe intensified arm . A third study find advantage patient treat intensively . These result lead widespread notion ASCT superior conventional chemotherapy unselected FL patient . Our previous non-randomized experience employ high dose sequential chemotherapy final TBI-free ASCT add clue consideration . Our study employ autografting procedure associate few secondary tumor include total body irradiation . Moreover observed regimen ( name HDS ) particularly effective high-risk patient , suggest specific subgroup appropriate setting intensify regimens The present multicenter open label randomize trial take advantage observation . In addition include Rituximab arm inclusion novel agent expect significantly modify performance available treatment . We thus compare Rituximab-supplemented version HDS ( R-HDS ) regimen six CHOP course supplement identical number Rituximab course . Aim study verify intensify approach could beneficial first line treatment high-risk FL patient Rituximab age .</detailed_description>
