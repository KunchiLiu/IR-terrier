	<brief_summary>Current American-European Consensus Conference ( AECC ) definition ALI ARDS inadequate inclusion clinical trial due lack standardization measure oxygenation defect . We question whether early assessment oxygenation specific ventilator setting would identify patient establish ARDS ( persist 24h ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We design study determine whether standard ventilator setting apply day ARDS identify ( Day 0 ) 24 hour ( Day 1 ) later : ( 1 ) would impact reclassification patient ALI ARDS , ( 2 ) would identify group different clinical outcome . Our hypothesis assessment PaO2/FiO2 standard ventilator setting 24 hour patient originally meet AECC definition ARDS would identify patient establish ARDS ( persist 24 h ) others different degree lung injury . If hypothesis support , would suggest patient good outcome could preferentially enter one group previously conduct clinical trial , result viable therapy prove useless useless therapy proven viable .</detailed_description>
