	<brief_summary>This study determine bone marrow stromal cell use graft regeneration bony defect . These cell ability form new bone support formation blood . Stromal cell identify tissue , dermis ( underside skin ) , spleen , thymus fat , know whether cell make bone support blood formation well bone marrow stromal cell . Patients undergo surgery Suburban Hospital Bethesda , Maryland , bone , dermis , spleen , thymus fat tissue remove may eligible study . For study , small piece tissue remove surgery examination pathologist use research . Stromal cell specimen collect grown laboratory . The gene proteins different cell type compare , ability stromal cell different tissue make bone support formation blood study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : It apparent virtually every human post-natal tissue contain type stem/progenitor cell population responsible tissue turnover repair . Our previous study identify subset human bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSCs ) multi-potent able regenerate bone , cartilage , myelosupportive stroma adipocytes , whereas stromal cell derive human spleen ( SpSCs ) thymus ( TSCs ) form myelosupportive stroma . Recent study suggest human adipose-derived stromal cell ( ASCs ) may similar BMSCs , whereas stromal cell derive human dermis ( DSCs ) none property ( serve negative control experiment vitro vivo ) . How similar dissimilar different stromal cell population yet determine . Molecular profiling need compare different population order elucidate factor control differentiation stromal cell one cell type another . Objectives : Surgical waste ( bone red marrow , dermis , spleen , thymus adipose tissue ) male females vary age undergo clinically indicate surgical procedure use establish stromal cell culture study molecular profile differentiation capacity stromal cell population different tissue characterize regulation gene expression protein synthesis stem/progenitor cell . Eligibility : Any patient undergoing clinically indicate surgery entail removal bone red marrow , dermis , spleen , thymus adipose tissue , : 1 ) history metabolic bone disease , 2 ) form cancer treat chemotherapy irradiation cancer , 3 ) receive agent know affect bone metabolism . Design : Normal surgical waste ( bone red marrow , dermis , spleen , thymus adipose ) procedure perform male female Suburban Hospital place nutrient medium ( provide NIDCR ) send NIDCR establishment cell culture strain . Only age , gender site tissue remove record . The cell culture different tissue use determine phenotypic character differentiation property molecular profiling , study elucidate regulation gene expression protein synthesis . Similarly , portion sample obtain Suburban Hospital use generate histological section normal tissue use screen newly develop antibody molecular probe . In case , RNA extract tissue RT-PCR analysis . These sample ( cell , section , mRNA ) also serve normal control study perform sample obtain patient various disease recruit NIH current NIH protocol ( 97-D-0055 , 97-D-0145 , 01-D-0184 ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Any patient age 18 year undergo clinically indicate elective surgery entail removal bone red marrow , periosteum , dermis , spleen , thymus , muscle adipose tissue . All patient must sign document inform consent indicate understanding specimen collect demographic information provide research purpose . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any patient history metabolic bone disease . Any patient cancer type , treat cancer type . Any patient treat reagent know affect bone metabolism ( bisphosphonates , steroid , vitamin D )</criteria>
