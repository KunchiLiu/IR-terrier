	<detailed_description>Physical inactivity contribute greatly health care burden old adult associate high prevalence functional limitation , morbidity , disability . Rates physical inactivity high among old adult . Older veteran , compare non-veteran older adult , likely physically inactive report limitation physical function . Increasing physical activity among old veteran promise approach reduce burden chronic disease associate functional limitation . The purpose study determine whether 12-month physical activity counsel program , compare usual care , improve physical performance sample old veterans The primary physical performance outcome change gait speed . Secondary objective include examination effect intervention two group ( intervention usual care ) physical activity , self-reported physical function , health-related quality life . We also estimate health care cost two group determine short-term economic impact counsel VHA . Design . Randomized control clinical trial . Data collection . All consent patient receive baseline computer assist interview physical performance test repeat quarterly one-year . The primary outcome change gait speed , highly predictive subsequent institutionalization mortality . Secondary outcome measure include : SF-36 physical function relevant subscales , health-related quality life , physical activity , self-efficacy , personal functional goal . Differences group non-routine outpatient clinic use hospitalization explore . The cost provide intensive intervention ( relative cost usual care ) calculate relative functional change group . Individuals randomize intervention group receive physical activity counsel intervention include four component . We measure assess change endpoint ( 3,6,9 , 12 , 24 month ) determine short long-term efficacy . Secondary analysis include : ( ) effect intervention self-reported physical function , physical activity , personal functional goal , self-efficacy , ( b ) comparison outpatient clinic use hospitalization cost treatment arm relative intervention cost . Duration Four year . Relevance VA. Because approximately 50 % veteran age 74 limiting disability , imperative explore strategy alter course functional decline age veteran .</detailed_description>
