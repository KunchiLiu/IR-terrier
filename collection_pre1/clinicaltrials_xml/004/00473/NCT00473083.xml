	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine rash cause erlotinib successfully treat determine optimal treatment approach . Hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : If incidence rash 50 % erlotinib , prophylactic monotherapy minocycline prevent occurrence 50 % patient . Hypothesis 2 : Treatment rash successful improve rash least one Grade 80 % patient . Hypothesis 3 : In patient untreated rash , rash self-limiting 25 % patient , 65 % grade 1 , 2A , 2b . Ten percent grade 3 require treatment monotherapy intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Erlotinib show prolong survival NSCLC patient longer candidate chemotherapy . In July 2005 , erlotinib approve Canada treatment patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC , follow failure first second-line chemotherapy . Erlotinib 's side effect profile include rash . The incidence rash clinical trial report approximately 50 - 75 % , hypothesise parallel tumour response ( 20 ) . The treatment rash controversial many oncologist believe untreatable self-limiting . The cause rash well understood felt systemic event . Clinical experience investigator suggest minocycline 100 mg orally give twice-daily 4 week clindamycin 2 % hydrocortisone 1 % topical cream moderate severe rash successful treatment . The objective trial well delineate rash feature describe optimal treatment . Since rash often facial distribution therefore lead physical psychological distress patient , dermatology life quality index also complete throughout study .</detailed_description>
