	<brief_title>Contact Lens Pediatrics ( CLIP ) Asian Population Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This bilateral , open-label dispense evaluation two daily lens type . Eligible subject wear study lens 3-months daily wear . 1-Day Acuvue worn spherical subject 1-Day Acuvue Astigmatism worn astigmats . There total 4 study visit ( baseline , contact fit dispensing , 1 week , 1 month 3 month follow-up ) . Tests conduct include manifest refraction over-refraction , keratometry , visual acuity , ACA ratio , lens fit assessment , slit lamp biomicroscopy parent/patient questionaires . Each child provide supply lens last next schedule follow-up visit , unit-dose rewetting drop rinse lens necessary , daily log complete day next follow-up visit . Informed consent obtain subject nature study fully explain . The study gain approval Ethics Committee Singapore Eye Research Institute .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be 811 year age . Signed Written Informed Consent and/or consent parent legal guardian Investigator record Case Report Form ( CRF ) appropriate space . Be neophyte . Require visual correction eye . Require soft contact lens spherical correction +5.00 9.00 DS . Have astigmatic correction 0.00 amd 2.00 DC . Be able wear lens power available study . Be correctable visual acuity 20/25 good eye . Have normal eye evidence abnormality disease . For purpose study normal eye define one : ( ) No amblyopia . ( ii ) No evidence lid abnormality infection . ( eg . entropion , ectropion , chalazia , recurrent stye ) . ( iii ) No clinically significant slit lamp ( eg . infiltrates slit lamp finding Grade 3 : corneal edema , corneal staining , tarsal abnormality , conjunctival injection , vascularisation , abnormal opacity ) . ( iv ) No active ocular disease . ( eg . glaucoma , history recurrent corneal erosion , cornea infiltrates , conjunctiva , lid , intraocular infection inflammation allergic , bacterial , viral etiology . ) Requires concurrent ocular medication . Any systemic illness would contraindicate lens wear medical treatment would affect vision successful lens wear . No clinically significant ( Grade 3 4 ) slit lamp finding include corneal edema , corneal vascularization , corneal staining , tarsal abnormality , bulbar injection , abnormality cornea would contraindicate contact lens wear . Diabetic . Infectious disease ( eg.hepatitis , tuberculosis ) immunosuppressive disease ( eg.HIV ) . PMMA RGP lens wear previous 8 week . Has refractive surgery . Has eye injury/surgery within 8 week immediately prior enrollment study . Abnormal lacrimal secretion . Preexisting ocular irritation would preclude contact lens fit . Keratoconus corneal irregularity . Pregnancy , lactate plan pregnancy time enrollment . Participation concurrent clinical trial .</criteria>
