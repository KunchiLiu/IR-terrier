	<brief_title>Safety Intravitreal POT-4 Therapy Patients With Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness individual fifty-five year age live industrialize world . It affect 5-10 million people US many 30 million worldwide . There two form disease , cause loss central vision . Approximately eighty-five percent patient less severe dry form produce gradual rarely complete vision loss . The remain fifteen percent severe wet , exudative , form cause rapid , disable blindness . Wet AMD characterize choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) , growth macula abnormal blood vessel originate choroidal capillary bed . Research link chronic inflammation form AMD . Only recently , unrestrained complement activation identify genetic study one key mechanism pathogenesis AMD . It also demonstrate complement activation play crucial role development CNV . Therefore , use intravitreal complement inhibitor may beneficial participant subject neovascular AMD . This prospective , uncontrolled , non-randomized , dose-escalating , pilot Phase I study provide initial safety tolerability information intravitreal complement inhibitor ( POT-4 ) therapy AMD patient subfoveal CNV .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Understand sign IRBapproved inform consent document study . Age ≥ 50 year . In study eye , diagnosis exudative AMD define presence drusen large 63 μm . In study eye , presence choroidal neovascular lesion , either predominantly minimally classic occult classic nature , determine Digital Angiography Reading Center ( DARC ) CNV define fluorescein angiographic ( FA ) feature . The lesion must contain visible active CNV , active CNV need fovea . Visual acuity 20/60 worse study eye measure ETDRS chart . Retinal photograph angiography sufficient quality , allow assessment macular area accord standard clinical practice , obtain . Willingness comply protocol . Choroidal neovascularization study eye associate ocular disease pathologic myopia , ocular histoplasmosis posterior uveitis , etc . Decreased vision , study eye , due retinal disease attributable CNV , nonexudative form AMD , geographic atrophy , inherit retinal dystrophy , uveitis epiretinal membrane , vitelliformlike lesion outer retina ( e.g. , pattern dystrophy basal laminar drusen ) , idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasis , central serous retinopathy . Participants additional ocular disease irreversibly compromise , followup , could likely compromise VA study eye include amblyopia , anterior ischemic optic neuropathy , clinically significant diabetic macular edema , severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy , proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Decreased vision , study eye , due significant medium opacity corneal disease cataract , opacity preclude photography retina . Cataract surgery within three month enrolment . Presence hemorrhage great 50 % CNV lesion . Previous PDT treatment study eye ( eye treat ) within 30 day prior enrollment study . Previous extrafoveal juxtafoveal thermal laser photocoagulation study eye ( eye treat ) allow , perform least 30 day prior enrollment study . Previous Macugen ( pegaptanib ) injection study eye ( eye treat ) within 30 day prior enrollment study . Previous Lucentis ( ranibizumab ) injection study eye ( eye treat ) within 30 day prior enrollment study . Previous Avastin ( bevacizumab ) injection study eye ( eye treat ) within 30 day prior enrollment study . Previous corticosteroid injection study eye ( eye treat ) within 180 day prior enrollment study . History peribulbar corticosteroid injection within 6 month prior start trial . History oral steroid use time 30 day prior randomization . Intraocular surgery ( include lens replacement surgery ) within 6 week prior randomization . Participation clinical study receiving , receive experimental systemic treatment AMD ( e.g . : retinoic acid , thalidomide ) investigational new drug within 12 week prior start study treatment . Medical problem make consistent followup treatment period unlikely ( e.g . stroke , severe MI , end stage malignancy ) , general poor medical risk systemic disease active uncontrolled infection .
