	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study evaluate new two-stage approach ( delayed-immediate reconstruction ) breast reconstruction woman may require post-mastectomy radiation therapy . Researchers compare cosmetic outcome complication occur woman receive delayed-immediate reconstruction receive standard approach ( either immediate reconstruction delay breast reconstruction ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed-Immediate Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In woman mastectomy desire breast reconstruction , best timing breast reconstruction depend whether radiation therapy ( XRT ) need . If XRT need , immediate reconstruction offer best cosmetic result . However , XRT need , good delay reconstruction XRT complete . There 2 reason wait . First , presence reconstruct breast interfere delivery XRT , decrease effectiveness treatment . Second , expose reconstruct breast radiation cause poor cosmetic result . Today , many woman offer immediate reconstruction know time mastectomy whether need XRT . Researchers believe woman , new approach call `` delayed-immediate reconstruction '' offer cosmetic benefit immediate reconstruction without potential drawback ineffective treatment . If agree take part study , already schedule skin-sparing mastectomy . However , time routine mastectomy , also tissue expander postoperatively adjustable implant ( fully inflate saline allow remain capacity [ space ] retain breast skin ) place breast . Some patient small biopsy skin , normally discard , do scientist learn change way heal radiation . When final pathology report complete ( 1 week mastectomy ) , radiation doctor and/or surgeon decide whether need XRT . If result show need XRT , tissue expander implant remove standard definitive breast reconstruction , use preserve breast skin 2 week mastectomy . The reconstructive technique use decide base anatomical consideration , surgical factor , personal desire . The postoperative follow-up similar patient standard immediate breast reconstruction . If result show need XRT , tissue expander adjustable implant completely deflate plastic surgery clinic receive standard XRT . Radiation must give either MD Anderson MD Anderson-affiliated site . Deflation tissue expander implant result flat chest wall decrease difficulty radiation delivery occur immediate breast reconstruction . If also require chemotherapy mastectomy , tissue expander implant remain inflated chemotherapy ( additional saline-filling may also perform chemotherapy , require ) . In patient already receive chemotherapy mastectomy require chemotherapy , expander implant remain inflated 4-to-6-week period mastectomy XRT . About 3 week radiation treatment , come plastic surgery clinic follow-up check status implant . Several week completion XRT , tissue expander postoperatively adjustable implant gradually re-expanded 6-months . The internal scar capsule form around tissue expander implant deflation usually allow re-expansion radiation therapy . Re-expansion radiation therapy perform postoperative visit plastic surgery clinic every 2-to-4 week desire size achieve . About 6 month completion XRT , `` skin-preserving '' delay reconstruction preference autologous tissue ( breast implant ) perform . This involve removal tissue expander implant definitive breast reconstruction . At time skin-preserving delayed reconstruction , small biopsy usually throw away radiate breast tissue well sample skin , normally discard , flap ( tissue take back , stomach buttock build breast ) sample implant tissue expander collect laboratory evaluation . Researchers evaluate skin change radiation expansion well internal scar capsule . This compare radiate skin biopsy without expansion biopsy take skin expansion without radiation . Your medical information photograph breast ( ) gather throughout various stage delayed-immediate reconstruction . Delayed-immediate breast reconstruction two-stage approach involve least 2 surgical procedure . This include possibility procedure need modify reconstruct breast , procedure healthy breast make symmetrical ( similar appearance size ) reconstruct breast , nipple reconstruction areolar tattoo may need . If , later , necessary revise reconstruct breast , small skin sample ( small pencil eraser ) collect additional study . This affect outcome surgery way breast look . The postoperative course , follow-up , need additional surgical procedure decide similar fashion standard immediate delay breast reconstruction . This investigational study . The implant study FDA approve skin expansion method breast reconstruction . They specifically approve expansion radiation . About 200 woman take part study . All enrol MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients clinical stage I stage II breast cancer may require postmastectomy XRT . 2 . Patients require receive postmastectomy XRT well breast reconstructive procedure , include subsequent deflation reinflation prosthesis XRT University Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ( UT MDACC ) . 3 . Patients must sign consent form must able withstand two ( 2 ) anesthetic procedure . 4 . Patients stage I breast cancer eligible delayedimmediate breast reconstruction extensive microcalcifications within affected mammography make difficult determine preoperatively extent invasive disease . 1 . Patients stage III stage IV breast cancer know preoperatively require postmastectomy XRT . 2 . Patients stage I breast cancer unlikely require postmastectomy XRT .</criteria>
