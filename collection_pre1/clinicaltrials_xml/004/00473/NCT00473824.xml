	<brief_title>Randomized Phase II Study Hepatitis C Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) , Civacir ( TM ) , Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection lead single cause liver transplantation ( LT ) US Europe . Recurrence HCV infection follow LT almost universal . There currently effective way prevent post-transplantation HCV infection liver graft relate progression HCV-related liver disease . This study design evaluate polyclonal human hepatitis C immune globulin ( Civacir ) give post liver transplantation prevent reduce impact recurrent HCV infection . In open-label trial , 2 subject randomize receive Civacir ( standard care treatment plus Civacir ) every 1 Control subject ( standard care treatment alone ) . Civacir recipient receive 18 intravenous infusion 24 week begin time liver transplantation . Viral load , liver enzyme assessment liver biopsy assessment make schedule interval study last 48 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female , 18 75 year age . Written informed consent . Expectation compliance protocol procedure . If female , negative pregnancy test within 3 day prior randomization use acceptable method contraception least one year postmenopausal surgically sterile . HCV infection identify positive , quantifiable HCVRNA test within 3 month prior transplantation . First time liver transplant recipient . Primary , single organ recipient ( decease donor &lt; 65 year age ) . Normal TSH . Subjects preLT diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) may enrol provide : evidence extrahepatic spread , tumor solitary &lt; 5cm three tumor &lt; 3 cm . Agree receive study medication outline protocol follow study relate procedure conclusion protocol participation . Agree consume alcohol entire study period . Has receive investigational agent within last six week prior liver transplantation . Exceptions include Theraspheres hepatocellular carcinoma rifaximin . Known immunoglobulin A deficiency . Subject weigh 112.5 Kg ( 248 pound ) . Known history cancer , suspect cancer , cancer therapy within 12 month prior administration investigational product , except treatment basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , cancer cervix situ , early stage prostate cancer ( Gleason 's grade 1 2 ) , history malignancy risk recurrence &gt; = 20 % within 2 year . A significant exception hepatocellular carcinoma predefined acceptability ( see inclusion criterion ) . Has condition judge study physician preclude participation study , include psychological disorder , might hinder compliance . History use immunosuppressive immunomodulatory drug within 3 month prior randomization ( except lowdose physiologic replacement glucocorticoid therapy ( &lt; =10 mg prednisone equivalent per day ) . Recipient liver living donor . Subjects whose liver obtain nonbeating heart donor . Subjects schedule receive split liver transplantation . Liver transplant obtain donor across ABO incompatible blood type . Donor liver cold ischemic time great 20 hour . Donor liver hepatitis C positive donor . Evidence unresolved infection unresolved opportunistic infection require treatment . Serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0 time upper limit normal advanced renal disease screening . Neutrophil count &lt; 1500 cells/mm3 , WBC &gt; 20,000 x 109/L , Hgb &lt; 8 g/dL , platelet count &lt; 25,000 cells/mm3 . Planned use Tcell deplete antibody therapy . Hepatitis B ( sAg , cAb IgM ) , hepatitis A ( IgM ) HIV infection . History autoimmune disease ( SLE , scleroderma , RA , etc. ) . Women pregnant breast feeding . The use colony stimulate factor agent facilitate subject 's entry study within 2 week enrollment . History severe psychiatric disease , especially depression . Seizure disorder uncontrolled anticonvulsant ( within last 12 mo ) . History severe cardiac disease , unhealed gastric duodenal ulcer , significant medical disease would put subject risk volume infusion significant risk bleed underlying condition . Evidence alcohol and/or drug abuse within 6 month entry inability/unwillingness abstain alcohol throughout entire course treatment followup . Concomitant medication rifabutin , pyrazinamide , isoniazid , thalidomide , oxymetholone ( Anadrol ) . History thyroid disease poorly control prescribed medication . History evidence severe illness condition would make subject , opinion investigator , unsuitable Civacir treatment .</criteria>
