	<brief_title>The Effect Weight Loss Dietary Protein Intake Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It unclear whether protein intake diet influence bone density . This information important determine optimal nutrient requirement weight loss . This study compare effect weight loss lower-carbohydrate , high-protein ( HP ) diet high-carbohydrate , moderate protein ( HC ) diet bone mass quality postmenopausal woman ( age 50-70 year ) hypothesis bone turnover loss bone reduce HP compare HC weight loss diet . Bone loss partially explain change fat mass estrogen level . Participants randomly assign one 2 group : A ) weight loss recommend level protein intake , B ) weight loss high protein intake . All participant attend regular counseling session ( 50 minute per session ) dietitian approximately 1 year , ask take daily vitamin/mineral supplement . Also , depend usual food intake , may ask take calcium tablet meet recommend intake throughout study period . Bone , mineral , protein lipid marker , hormone influence bone measure . These measurement provide information body composition ( fat , muscle mass , bone mineral density ) . Participants ask attend 8 diet counseling session , opportunity attend total approximately 28 diet counseling session year .</detailed_description>
