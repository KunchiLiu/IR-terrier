	<detailed_description>The incidence in-stent restenosis percutaneous coronary intervention vary 5 35 % bare metal stenting high 19 % implantation drug-eluting stent patient moderate risk . Restenosis due neointimal hyperplasia slow process , suggest therapeutic local drug administration would need prolonged beneficial . Stent-based local drug delivery provide sustain drug release use special release technology like polymer coating . However , cell culture experiment indicate even brief contact vascular smooth muscle cell lipophilic taxane compound inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation long period . In experiment swine , intracoronary delivery paclitaxel contrast medium drug-coated balloon catheter find result vascular tissue concentration capable produce antiproliferative effect , thus lead significant reduction neointimal proliferation . In animal study , pronounce reduction neointimal formation see paclitaxel-coated balloon catheter .</detailed_description>
