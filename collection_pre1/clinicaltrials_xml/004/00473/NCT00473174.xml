	<brief_title>Comparison Awakening Versus Bedtime Dosing Ramipril Subjects With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several attribute cardiovascular system , include blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate ( HR ) , characterize predictable change 24 hour part synchrony rest-activity cycle . During past two decade specific feature 24-hour BP pattern assess potential source injury target tissue trigger cardiac cerebrovascular event hypertensive patient . A grow number study indicate reduction normal 10 20 % sleep-time BP decline ( non-dipper pattern ) associate elevate risk end-organ injury , particularly heart ( leave ventricular hypertrophy myocardial infarct ) , brain ( stoke ) kidney ( albuminuria progression end-stage renal failure ) . Accordingly , grow interest tailor treatment hypertensive patient accord circadian BP pattern . Clinical study demonstrate different effect ACEIs benazepril , enalapril , perindopril , quinapril , spirapril , trandolapril dose morning versus evening . A small trial 33 patient essential hypertension show low dose 2.5 mg/day ramipril effectively reduce daytime BP administer morning effectively reduce nighttime BP administer even . In HOPE ( Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ) study patient active treatment group receive ramipril bedtime . Results small substudy , hypertensive patient evaluate 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) , show mark BP reduction particularly nighttime sleep , thereby reduce prevalence non-dippers . The author conclude effect cardiovascular morbidity mortality see ramipril HOPE study may relate improved effect ( i.e. , increase diurnal/nocturnal BP ratio ) non-dipping BP pattern . In keep documented administration-time dependent effect BP regulation ACEI , prospective chronotherapy trial investigate potential differ efficacy ramipril dose 5 10 mg/day administer , monotherapy either upon awaken nighttime sleep bedtime , diurnally active patient grade 1 2 essential hypertension , evaluate 48-hour ABPM pharmacologic intervention . The benefit trial may extremely important , take account 1 ) high prevalence non-dipping among patient essential hypertension , 2 ) need proper 24-hour BP control particular emphasis regulation nighttime rest BP mean , 3 ) lack information administration-time dependent effect BP ramipril , widely use ACEI dose 5-10 mg/day .</detailed_description>
