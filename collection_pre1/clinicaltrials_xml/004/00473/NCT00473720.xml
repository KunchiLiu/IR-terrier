	<criteria>Patients must histologicallyconfirmed advanced solid tumor . The patient must refractory standard therapy tumor therapy clinical benefit exists . Patients evidence disease progression receive prior therapy . This include development new lesion increase preexist lesion bone scintigraphy , CT , MRI physical examination . Patients sole criterion progression increase biochemical marker , e.g. , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , increase symptom , eligible , exception biochemical marker PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) . No radiotherapy , treatment cytotoxic agent , treatment biologic agent within 4 week prior begin treatment study ( 6 week mitomycin nitrosoureas ) . Patients must fully recover acute toxicity prior treatment cytotoxic drug , radiotherapy anticancer modality ( return baseline status note recent treatment ) . Patients persist , stable chronic toxicity prior treatment ≤ grade 1 eligible . All nonprostate cancer patient need least 2 week hormonal therapy . Prostate cancer patient need maintain castrate level testosterone least 2 week non steroidal antiandrogen , diethylstilbestrol , ketoconazole . At least 2 week must elapse prior surgery . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) . Life expectancy great 3 month .

Such patient steroid minimum two week prior first dose study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition agent use study . Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study investigational agent may potential teratogenic abortifacient effect .
