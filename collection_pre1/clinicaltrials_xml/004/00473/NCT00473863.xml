	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography ( CCTA ) increase patient safety decrease rate miss ACS adverse event patient receive standard care plus CCTA versus standard care alone . Additional goal study determine whether CCTA safely reduce duration ED visit number duration hospital admission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography Emergency Department Chest Pain Patients Intermediate Risk Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification : Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) clinical manifestation acute myocardial ischemia induce coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Although patient present chest pain Emergency Department ( ED ) stratify `` high risk '' `` low risk '' chest pain algorithm , patient `` intermediate risk '' difficult manage . This translate lengthy wait ED repetitive investigation 5.3 % case ACS still miss many patient admit CCU ( false positive rate 14 % ) . CCTA novel , non-invasive method evaluate coronary artery stenosis occlusion . The ability accurately diagnose exclude ACS patient rapid , non-invasive fashion previously lack . If CCTA show clinically useful risk stratification patient population , great potential increase patient safety , reduce ED admission time decrease number duration CCU admission . Objectives : ED admission discharge time , CCU consult decision time duration CCU admission , cardiac risk factor , vital sign , laboratory result , ED disposition plan , CCTA result , coronary calcium score , index hospitalization diagnosis , investigation , revascularization rate well 30-day diagnosis , death , adverse event rate subsequent investigation . Research Method : The study population consist ED chest pain patient intermediate risk ACS . Informed consent obtain CCTA 30-day follow . Patients randomize one two diagnostic arm : standard care plus CCTA versus standard care alone . If patient receives CCTA , test interpret blinded radiologist result provide ED physician enter patient chart . A research nurse collect workflow clinical data enrol patient . Two reviewer , ED physician cardiologist , blind CCTA result , independently review index 30 day clinical data . One follow assign : acute myocardial infarction , definite unstable angina , possible unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome . Alternate non-ACS diagnosis ascertain applicable . Statistical Analysis This proposal represent pilot study demonstrate feasibility identify recruit patient trial , demonstrate feasibility collect follow-up data , provide preliminary estimate outcome measure help determine sample size require definitive study . All analysis descriptive . Recruitment , crossover , follow-up , completion rate determine . Estimates diagnostic accuracy length stay ED determine used inform design definitive study .</detailed_description>
