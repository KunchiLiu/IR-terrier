	<brief_summary>In order improve survival metastatic breast patient , important investigate use novel therapeutic agent combine know active agent treatment breast cancer . This phase I study evaluate maximum tolerated dos toxicity RAD001 combination capecitabine treatment metastatic breast cancer . RAD001 ( INN : everolimus ) novel macrolide , develop antiproliferative drug application immunosuppressant anticancer agent . Phase I trials patient solid tumor show treatment RAD001 well-tolerated minimal side effect profile . Capecitabine ( Xeloda , Roche ) oral fluoropyrimidine approve 1998 treatment patient metastatic breast cancer . The all-oral regimen RAD001 capecitabine attractive approach treatment metastatic breast cancer yet prove curative . We also want find possible benefit combination drug might treat cancer .</brief_summary>
