	<brief_summary>Will metformin improve exercise capacity chronic heart failure patient insulin resistance ( pre-diabetic- mean become diabetic ) ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Insulin Resistant Left Ventricular ( LV ) Dysfunction ( TAYSIDE Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise incapacity one major debilitate symptom heart failure patient . Studies show heart failure patient become insulin resistance ( IR ) vice versa , severity heart failure also correlate severity insulin resistance . A recent study demonstrate correct diabetic patient insulin resistance give drug make sensitive effect insulin , exercise capacity improve . Therefore , think effect might happen heart failure patient identify insulin resistance blood test . Insulin resistance mean yet become diabetic stage diabetic patient go develop diabetes . Therefore , plan use drug call metformin ( diabetic drug ) , give heart failure patient also IR 4 month examine effect 4 month treatment . It double blind control study , therefore , neither examiner patient know drug receive ( either active drug- Metformin , placebo ) . The main objective ass exercise capacity use exercise test call Innocor System . It bicycle base exercise test involve patient breathe mouth piece exercise order machine work maximum oxygen consumption pump power heart . The objective trial look possible mechanism improve exercise capacity . We aim answer follow question follow test : Does exercise capacity improve 1 . The effect metformin heart ? We answer question ultrasound scan heart ( Echocardiography ) 2 . The effect blood vessel ? We plan perform test call flow-mediated dilatation , ultrasound scan artery arm also assess blood flow skin use test call Laser Doppler scan ( small amount medication deliver small electric current blood vessel response assess use laser doppler scan ) 3 . The effect muscle ? We muscle biopsy look enzymes activity muscle take 4 month medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 2580 yr compensate CHF NYHA functional IIII evidence insulin resistance [ fast insulin resistance index value &gt; 2.7 say insulin resistance ] . Documented Left ventricular systolic dysfunction LV ejection fraction &lt; 35 % Elderly patient ( age &gt; 80 yr ) ; Patients decompensated CHF ( NYHA functional class IV /or sign decompensated CHF ) ; Renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine &gt; 160 mmol/L ) ; Patients unable exercise include patient exclude reason safety potential effect exercise performance . Therefore , patient angina cardiac pulmonary symptom potentially limit exercise performance exclude . Systolic blood pressure &gt; 190 mmHg rest &gt; 250 mmHg exercise diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg rest &gt; 105 mmHg exercise also reason exclusion ; Patients underlie disease likely limit life span and/or increase risk intervention exclude i.e. , cancer ; cardiovascular disease .i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension : SBP &gt; 180 mmHg DBP , recent stroke , severe chronic disease ( include renal hepatic disease ) .</criteria>
