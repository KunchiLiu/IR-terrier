In addition , Xrays do determine location osteochondroma . All Xrays review . No new one take unless part patient 's routine care . To complete genetic work DNA analysis do available family member . This entail obtain blood sample family member willing partake study . These blood sample use purpose identify abnormality gene relate osteochondromas .
