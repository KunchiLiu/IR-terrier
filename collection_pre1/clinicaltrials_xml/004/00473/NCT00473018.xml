	<brief_summary>This randomized trial compare effect standard versus enhance risk reduction counsel risk behavior incidence individual receive PEP medication . The study seek 1 ) determine equivalent change incidence self-reported risk behavior , STD incidence , adherence medication individual receive enhance risk reduction adherence counsel receive standard risk reduction adherence counseling ; 2 ) evaluate viral host biological factor involve sexual transmission may either influence PEP efficacy , negatively positively affected administration PEP medication ; 3 ) contribute CDC registry attempt provide crucial data case control analysis establish efficacy PEP sexual injection drug use exposure . The principal outcome change participant ' number unprotected sexual act follow administration PEP . This defined number prior 3-month act high risk unprotected sex , assess 12 month follow course PEP , minus number unprotected act participant report 3 6 month prior begin PEP ( assessed baseline ) . Methods use consist interview data collection , questionnaire , risk reduction adherence counsel source recruitment counseling ( index subject ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS Our group ( include behavioral , epidemiological , basic , clinical scientist UCSF , San Francisco General Hospital , The San Francisco Department Public Health , UCSF-affiliated Gladstone Institute Virology Immunology ) conduct feasibility study Post Exposure Prevention ( PEP ) successfully recruit , retain , assess 400 individual recently substantially expose HIV-1 ( index case ) , well significant number person ( source case ) expose index case HIV-1 . We frequently ask physician public health professional help establish similar program various community . PEP two promise possibility : ( ) may prevent HIV infection ( b ) may viable way attract high risk uninfected individual counsel . But tremendous uncertainty remain integrate PEP exist clinical prevention program . Because felt risk reduction counsel essential prevent disinhibition , provide intensive ( 5 session ) prevention counsel feasibility study . Adherence counseling also essential incomplete adherence could reduce effectiveness medication increase chance infection resistant isolate . However , multi-session counsel resource intensive . The urgent question address PEP whether PEP medication must offer enhanced counseling program , standard HIV pre- post-test counseling routine adherence counsel result equivalent risk behavior follow PEP adherence antiretroviral medication . Thus , propose follow primary aim : 1 . To conduct randomized trial determine whether enhance ( multi-session ) risk reduction adherence counsel equivalent standard ( 2 session ) risk reduction adherence counseling term self-reported risk behavior document STDs adherence PEP medication . In addition , recruit cohort HIV-infected individual engage behavior potentially capable transmit HIV , well HIV uninfected individual recently expose HIV , unique opportunity address follow important aim : 2 . Source ( HIV infect person potentially transmit ) virologic characteristic : To describe compare ( ) HIV-1 RNA level ( b ) antiretroviral resistance mutation prevalence plasma genital secretion source subject . 3 . Index ( expose HIV uninfected ) subject CD8+ T-cell antiviral factor activity response : 1 . To determine whether PEP medication blunt CD8+ T-cell antiviral factor ( CAF ) activity compare change CAF follow HIV exposure person receive PEP medication individual match exposure receive medication ; 2 . To determine whether correlation source plasma genital secretion HIV-1 RNA level index CAF activity . ) 4 . To evaluate safety add 2 dos nevirapine exist medication regimen base two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor Â¬+ protease inhibitor .</detailed_description>
