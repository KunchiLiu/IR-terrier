The aim propose 2-year study gather pilot data feasibility implement nutritionist-delivered low GI intervention , reduce dietary GI patient type 2 diabetes , compare nutritionist-delivered standard American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) diet intervention . Our outcomes recruitment retention rate , well physiological measure ( HbA1c , blood lipid , blood pressure , body mass index ) , dietary GI score acceptability intervention . Primary hypothesis : 1 . Recruitment retention rate low GI intervention satisfactory . Secondary hypothesis : 1 . Participants low GI intervention group show favorable change physiological measure participant ADA diet group . 2 . Participants low GI group successful lower GI diet . 3 .

	<detailed_description>The glycemic index ( GI ) rank carbohydrate contain food accord rate raise blood glucose level eat . A recent meta-analysis randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) suggest choose low GI food small clinically useful effect medium-term glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes . However , review RCTs , patient feed experimental diet therefore still controversy applicability GI clinical setting management diabetes . In addition , evidence long-term consumption low GI diet contribute improve glycemic control people diabetes . Our ultimate goal future large RCT evaluate long-term effect use low GI diet type 2 diabetic . The primary outcome variable future large trial glycosylated hemoglobin level ( HbA1c ) , measure reflect average glycemic level precede 2-3 month . The propose feasibility study recruit 40 patient type 2 diabetes randomly assign one two group : low GI nutrition education group ( low GI group ) standard ADA dietary education group control group ( ADA group ) ( 20 patient group ) . For group , intervention phase last 6 month consist initial group session , individual session , four group counsel session . The follow-up phase six month consist two group booster session , one 8-months another 10-months . The low GI nutritional education primarily target low GI diet . The focus decrease total carbohydrate intake , rather encouraging patient substitute low GI food high GI food . The dietary intervention base patient-centered counseling model demonstrate facilitate health behavior change . Data collection point coincide two phase intervention . Assessments , include demographic , anthropometric measurement , diet physical activity recall , clinical data , conduct baseline , 6 12 month randomization , blood sample collect interval . We track response recruitment , adherence , retention . Quantitative qualitative method use assess acceptability intervention . The aim propose 2-year study gather pilot data feasibility implement nutritionist-delivered low GI intervention reduce dietary GI patient type 2 diabetes . Our outcomes recruitment retention rate , well physiological measure ( HbA1c , blood pressure , body mass index ) , dietary GI score acceptability intervention . By improve glycemic control , many devastate complication diabetes large extent preventable . The use low GI diet improve glycemic control relatively new untested . However , low GI diet may cost-effective approach prevent diabetes-related complication . Testing feasibility program potential impact would important step towards RO1 application NIH .</detailed_description>
