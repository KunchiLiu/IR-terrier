	<detailed_description>Pathogenesis Malaria Anaemia Although pathogenesis malaria anaemia completely understood ( 1 ) , mechanism propose include immune non-immune-mediated hemolysis parasitized non-parasitized red blood cell , bone marrow dysfunction iron delocalisation ( 2-4 ) . Plasmodium falciparum infection associate change cell membrane infect uninfected erythrocyte cause alteration membrane permeability susceptibility early hemolysis . It also associate bone marrow dysfunction probably due malaria-induced abnormality erythroid progenitor , CFU-e BFU-e ( 5,6 ) . Jason et ( l7 ) show malaria exerts pro-inflammatory immune response child associate release cytokine act various level erythropoietic pathway cause anaemia . These cytokine include human tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) ( 8 ) , interleukin ( IL ) -12 , IL-10 , IL-6 IL-4 ( 7,9 ) , interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) ( 9 ) . In addition absolute concentration cytokine , balance oppose anti- pro-inflammatory response may determine clinical characteristic malaria , include level anaemia ( 7 ) e.g . high TNF/IL-10 ratio may contribute reversible bone marrow suppression see malaria patient ( 10,11 ) . Several investigator report persistence fall haemoglobin successful treatment malaria1 ( 2 ) . Although precise mechanism persistent anaemia unclear , likely multifactorial . Studies conduct among Gambian children1 ( 3 ) , French adult ( 14 ) , Thai adult ( 15 ) show cytokine level remain elevated one four week successful treatment malaria ; Camacho et al ( 12 ) report 80 % Thai adult malaria persist anaemia day 7 , 14 , 21 successful treatment , 55 % still anaemic day 28 . On day 28 , 46 % subject hypoproliferative erythropoiesis 7 % ineffective erythropoiesis ( 12 ) . Although study explore mechanism behind finding , likely persist elevation inflammatory cytokine report early worker ( 13-15 ) could contributory . Greenberg colleague ( 16 ) suggest unusually strong prolong Th-1 response conjunction inadequately develop Th-2 response may contribute persistent anaemia clearance parasitaemia . Other worker report persistent microscopically undetectable parasitaemia follow successful treatment antimalarial associate protract bone marrow suppression ( 17 ) . Macrophages Malaria Anaemia Macrophages responsible removal senescent red blood cell body . They process erythrocyte release heme iron transport peripheral tissue include bone marrow . The mononuclear phagocyte system play two major role iron metabolism ( 18 ) - iron recycle senescent erythrocyte serve large storage depot excess iron . This macrophageal recycle account 20-24mg iron require daily haemoglobin production . The cytokine release part body 's response infection Plasmodium cause macrophage release oxygen nitrogen radical lead oxidative damage parasitized non-parasitized red blood cell , enhance removal circulation contribute anaemia ( 19 ) . In addition , malaria-induced inflammation impedes release iron macrophage-monocyte system hamper supply iron erythropoietic tissue . This cause considerable delocalisation iron within macrophage/monocyte system make iron unavailable marrow cell erythropoiesis ( 18 ) . The clinical practice administration iron malaria anaemia result observation serum iron often low patient , demonstrate several animal human study ( 20,21 ) . That hypoferraemia observe malaria could largely due iron sequestration macrophage support report decrease peripheral iron level despite normal increase bone marrow iron ( 22,23 ) . Iron supplementation versus macrophageal iron mobilization The recent controversy regard routine iron supplementation child malaria endemic area high prevalence anaemia highlight need alternative therapeutic regimen child malaria-associated anaemia . The genesis 'iron supplementation controversy ' arose several report increase morbidity mortality malaria infection child malaria endemic region supplement iron . Recent evidence ( review Prentice et al , Position paper WHO Expert Consultation , Lyon , June 2006 ) suggest risk adverse outcomes less anaemic child . However , grow body evidence point poor rationale give iron supplement child mild malaria anaemia . First , acute malaria , reduce iron absorption ( Doherty et al . submit , AJCN , 2006 ) least initially , erythropoietic iron supply likely come reticuloendothelial macrophage rather iron supplement . Secondly , hypoferreamia associate malaria show due iron delocalisation rather absolute iron lack , review 18 . Finally , number study find little benefit give iron supplement child malaria anaemia compare alternative regimen ( 24-27 ) . While management moderate severe malaria anaemia ( Hb &lt; 80g/L ) contention , management mild anaemia remain enigma iron supplementation child , apart provide questionable benefit , might fact harmful . Results large clinical trial routine iron supplementation child area iron deficiency malaria transmission Tanzania show among 24,076 child recruit receive iron folic acid , without zinc , significantly likely die experience adverse event child receive iron folic acid ( 28 ) . Presently , clear guideline management child mild malaria anaemia . Mild anaemia malaria endemic area likely due either malaria iron deficiency distinguish iron delocalization malaria iron deficiency difficult . It important optimize child 's iron nutrition promote optimal cognitive development ( 29 ) ; however iron supplementation group potentially dangerous hence urgent need alternative management strategy common clinical scenario Africa . Such intervention take consideration complex pathogenesis malaria anaemia include mechanism iron flux macrophageal iron delocalization Plasmodium falciparum infection . It likely reduction malaria-induced macrophageal iron sequestration inflammation enhance erythropoietic recovery post-malaria . We hypothesize anti-inflammatory , anti-macrophageal iron load anti-malarial effect chloroquine could make useful drug management mild post malaria anaemia reduce macrophageal iron sequestration interrupt malaria-induced inflammatory process . Chloroquine macrophageal iron mobilization agent Although resistance reduce effectiveness prevention treatment malaria , non-antimalarial pharmacological property chloroquine make potentially useful therapeutic agent condition . Chloroquine antipyretic anti-inflammatory property ( 30-32 ) . Chloroquine exert steroid-sparing effect ( 33 ) , inhibit replication number viruses HSV-1 virus ( 34 ) , HIV-1 several AIDS relate opportunistic microorganism ( 35,36 ) . By inhibit phospholipase A2 tumour necrosis factor , chloroquine act immunomodulator ( 37,38 ) ; also act lysosome-stabilizing agent . Clinically , chloroquine use second line anti-inflammatory drug chronic condition like rheumatoid arthritis ( 39 ) . Chloroquine iron metabolism Although role chloroquine iron metabolism still poorly understood , likely many effect chloroquine result interference intracellular free iron . Chloroquine , weak base , accumulate acid intracellular compartment increase intracellular pH . Legssyer co-worker show chloroquine significantly reduce incorporation iron liver ( 20 % reduction ) , spleen ( 20 % ) alveolar ( 400 % ) macrophages rat load vivo iron dextran40 . Chloroquine post malaria anaemia Chloroquine ( CQ ) may likely three effect different time point erythropoietic response malaria . Firstly may block acute incorporation iron reticuloendothelial macrophage clinical malaria associate haemolysis iron delocalization . Secondly may anti-inflammatory effect . Increased serum level TNF-α , IFN-γ nitric oxide depress erythropoiesis via bone marrow depression , dyserythropoiesis erythrophagocytosis . Continuing inflammation malarial event may contribute slow resolution anaemia ( 13-15 ) chloroquine 's anti-inflammatory effect might useful adjunctive therapy continue utilize initial antimalarial effect . Lastly chloroquine continue direct anti-malarial effect clear microscopically undetectable persistent infection prevent episodes haematological recovery optimize . The anti-anaemic effect chloroquine report number clinical study . Salihu colleagues41 report significant anti-anaemia effect chloroquine give weekly pregnant woman Cameroon compare woman give prophylaxis , even control possible confounders . Other study among pregnant woman Cameroon ( 42 ) , Burkina Faso ( 42 ) , Uganda ( 43 ) Thailand ( 44 ) show significant benefit weekly chloroquine maternal haemoglobin level compare control . Although study carry pregnant woman , likely similar benefit occur child . Aim Study Hypothesis test In explore effect chloroquine post malaria anaemia , hypothesize post-malarial CQ improve erythropoietic recovery standard malarial treatment . We hypothesize post-malarial CQ improve erythropoietic recovery co-artemether treatment , mechanism anti-malarial effect control residual parasitaemia . To test hypothesis , plan randomize child ( age 12 month 6 year ) acute malaria receive either standard anti-malarial treatment ( chloroquine plus sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine ) artemisinine combination therapy . Three day commencement antimalarial treatment , child two arm , whose parasite clear , randomise receive either weekly chloroquine weekly placebo . By compare curve haemoglobin change day 3 day 30 placebo arm two group , test effect chloroquine vs. ACT treatment macrophageal iron load release acute clinical malaria . By compare haemoglobin change day 3 day 90 weekly chloroquine arm weekly placebo arm test longer-term anti-inflammatory anti- malarial effect weekly chloroquine prophylaxis . In addition primary endpoint ( haemoglobin change ) , plan assess potential mechanism action determine parasite clearance PCR detection , peripheral cytokine production ( &amp; marker inflammation ) , indicator monocyte iron loading iron flux . **Additional information : During course study , Gambian Government change antimalarial drug policy make artemisinine first line antimalarial discontinuing use chloroquine . We therefore force alter protocol remove initial chloroquine treatment .</detailed_description>
