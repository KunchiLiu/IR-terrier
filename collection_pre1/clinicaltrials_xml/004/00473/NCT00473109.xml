	<detailed_description>Conventional hemodialysis require transient systemic anticoagulation prevent blot clot contact extracorporeal circuit . However , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) unfractioned heparin contra-indicated dialysis patient risk hemorrhagic complication . In set , several procedure theoretically allow dialysis without systemic heparinization , randomize study compare lack . The gold standard use iterative rise extra corporeal circuit isotonic saline ( `` rise `` ) . Two emerge procedure increasingly use : continuous pre-dilution arterial line ( `` pre-dilution `` ) use specific dialysis membrane ( NEPHRAL 400 ST ) coat heparin immediately use ( `` heparin adsorption `` ) . We propose monocentric prospective randomize open study compare `` rise `` , `` pre-dilution `` `` heparin adsorption `` chronic hemodialysis patient contra-indication use LMWH . Main criteria extra-corporeal circuit clotting , dialysis efficiency tolerance secondary criterion . Comparison make ground `` n-of-1 `` trial , i.e . series randomize cross-over test individual . We plan include 75 patient study , 1050 LMWH-free dialysis session . We hope demonstrate chat comparison wit rise , pre-dilution heparin absorption technique reduce rate extra-corporeal circuit 30 50 % respectively . We also hope show heparin adsorption ( ) well preserve membrane integrity throughout dialysis session , result enhanced dialysis efficiency ; ( ii ) avoids extra fluid infusion ultrafiltration , result well dry weigh achievement well clinical tolerance .</detailed_description>
