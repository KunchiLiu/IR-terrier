	<brief_summary>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) selective destruction abnormal cell light activation photosensitiser presence oxygen . These cell accumulate photosensitiser normal cell . The photosensitiser generate reactive oxygen specie upon illumination . For skin disease , increase interest use precursor endogenous photoactive porphyrin . The commonly used precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) derivative . The present test drug , Metvix® , contain methyl ester ALA , penetrate lesion well show high lesion selectivity . BCC highly frequent skin malignancy , account approximately 75 % non-melanoma skin cancer . It common cancer human . Several non-pharmacological treatment modality use BCC , include excision surgery , curettage electrodesiccation , cryosurgery advance modality like radiation therapy , plastic surgery reconstruction Moh 's surgery . The treatment use depend type , size , depth localisation BCC lesion . Treatment option BCC give good response rate majority patient inadequate small group patient define `` high-risk '' BCC . In particular patient group , even moderate complete response rate good cosmetic result may consider beneficial , since number patient receive advanced therapy possibility high morbidity poor cosmetic outcome reduce . Even partial response clinical interest since remain tumour require less extensive surgery . In case treatment failure , Metvix PDT interfere use treatment modality . The variable `` complete response '' one two Metvix treatment cycle use basis justification sample size . The following hypothesis test : H0 : Complete response rate Metvix le equal 65 % versus alternative hypothesis HA : Complete response rate Metvix great 65 %</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metvix PDT Patients With `` High Risk '' Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , open , multicenter study . The high risk BCC lesion treat Metvix cream . A biopsy confirm diagnosis BCC lesion take within 6 month prior treatment . The patient receive one two treatment cycle consist two Metvix PDT treatments 7 day apart ( Lesion show non-complete response 3 month second PDT treatment cycle ) . The primary end-point histologically confirm complete response rate within patient ( No BCC cell biopsy take 3 month last treatment ) . Secondary endpoint safety evaluation first 13 week 6 month ( two treatment cycle ) first Metvix treatment , cosmetic outcome recurrence rate 12 , 24 , 35 , 48 60 month first Metvix treatment .</detailed_description>

OR • Patients `` highrisk BCC lesion ( ) . A `` highrisk '' BCC lesion define : A large BCC lesion large diameter : Equal great 15 mm extremity , except knee , large diameter equal great 10 mm Equal great 20 mm trunk Equal great 15 mm face , A lesion midface region ( Hzone accord Swanson ) ear In patient 6 eligible lesion , 6 lesion treat randomly choose .
