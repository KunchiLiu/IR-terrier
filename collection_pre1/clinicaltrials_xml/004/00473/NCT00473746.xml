	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate Dose-Escalation Study Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics ( study body drug ) , pharmacodynamics ( study drug body ) , anti-tumor activity abiraterone acetate ( also know CB7630 ) patient HRPC . The study conduct 2 phase ( Phase 1 Phase 2 ) . In first part study ( Phase 1 ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) abiraterone acetate determine use second part study ( Phase 2 ) number patient achieve least 50 % decrease prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) treatment abiraterone acetate assess ( MTD Phase 1 ) . Abiraterone acetate take orally ( mouth ) fed fast patient daily . Doses abiraterone acetate ( start 250 mg maximum 2000 mg ) take 28-day treatment period determine MTD . Patients take MTD abiraterone acetate twelve 28 day cycle ( 12 month ; patient give option stay abiraterone acetate treatment derive benefit ) . In Phase 2 , prednisone dexamethasone administer concurrently abiraterone acetate . Serial pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic sample collect safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
