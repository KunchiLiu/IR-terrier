	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer may cause build-up genetic defect , damage gene within body 's cell . When gene damage , body may unable produce group protein , call cytokine , use immune system fight cancer infection . The investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 contains human gene cytokine interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) special carrier system design enter cell help body produce cytokine . Therefore , purpose EGEN-001 therapy attempt enhance body 's natural ability recognize fight cancer cell . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
