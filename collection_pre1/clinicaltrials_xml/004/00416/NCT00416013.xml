	<detailed_description>Plasma BNP regard sensitive test congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Multiple study show BNP distress hormone release distended leave ventricular myocardium correlate significantly leave ventricular wedge pressure all-cause mortality CHF acute coronary syndrome . BNP also find highly prognostic across wide variety condition include pulmonary hypertension , pulmonary embolism general population mild increase associate stroke heart attack . BNP weakly variably correlate renal function . How much elevation relate renal clearance perturbation circulation uremia , hypertension chronic fluid overload cause speculative . There paucity information BNP level hemodialysis ( HD ) patient . Intuitively , BNP level ideal marker leave ventricular preload dry weight HD population . Furthermore since BNP short half-life 20 minute , serial measurement dialysis would expect rapidly reflect ultrafiltration fluid status . Currently amount fluid remove dialysis define clinically inter-dialysis weight gain , hypertension , edema dyspnea . Accurate assessment ideal dry weight critically important HD patient fluid overload intravascular dehydration fatal consequence frail population . The published article BNP marker adequacy dialysis give conflict data flaw small sample size sequential measurement patient . Cardiac troponins well-established marker myocardial injury . Both troponin I T subtypes regulatory protein help coordinate action actin myosin . Existing cytosol structure myocardium , release believe correlate breakdown actin myosin area myocardial damage . Elevated troponin level also correlate pulmonary embolism source right heart strain . Their use set patient ESRD less clear . Sampling asymptomatic ESRD patient find significant percentage elevate troponins . Proposed mechanisms increase include impaired renal excretion , leave ventricular hypertrophy , endothelial dysfunction , stretch mediate troponin release , leakage cytoplasmic free troponin secondary poor membrane integrity . Regardless mechanism , large study asymptomatic patient find significantly increased mortality increase troponins . While correlation increase troponins mortality show , effect hemodialysis troponin level yet demonstrate publish study . HYPOTHESIS : We believe dialysis patient ideal `` dry '' BNP level accurately reproducibly reflect optimal fluid status . Subsidiary hypothesis baseline BNP troponin , well change BNP troponin dialysis , highly predictive mortality adequacy dialysis .</detailed_description>
