	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together carboplatin work treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together carboplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) 6 month combination bortezomib carboplatin patient previously receive 1 prior regimen metastatic pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective tumor response rate , duration response , time tumor progression , overall survival . II . To evaluate biological effect peripheral blood mononuclear cell . III . To evaluate safety profile combination . IV . To evaluate archival tissue epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) E-cadherin Zeb-1 . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
