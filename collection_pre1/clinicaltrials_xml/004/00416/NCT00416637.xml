	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether anti-vascular epidermal growth factor ( VEGF ) treatment comprise bevacizumab cause change endothelial cell function , measure brachial reactivity , change nitric oxide ( NOx ) , measure plasma/urinary/exhaled NOx level , patient advance solid tumor . - Determine whether anti-VEGF-related change blood pressure correlate change brachial reactivity NOx level . Secondary - Evaluate anti-angiogenic effect bevacizumab neovascular tissue wound angiogenesis model . - Correlate inhibition wound angiogenesis change VEGF-receptor 2 phosphorylation status change NOx synthase expression . - Describe mean associate variability plasma urine marker know associated vascular reactivity , endothelial function , and/or tumor angiogenesis . - Describe , preliminarily , whether change correlate change blood pressure , brachial reactivity , NOx level , wound angiogenesis . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 . After third dose bevacizumab , patient may receive additional bevacizumab combination chemotherapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
