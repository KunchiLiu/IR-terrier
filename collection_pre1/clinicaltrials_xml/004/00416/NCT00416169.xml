	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore safety tolerability efficacy galantamine treatment subject Pick Complex/ Frontotemporal Dementia ( PC/FTD ) . The safety tolerability galantamine therapy assess entire treatment period ( 26 week ) . The 8 week withdrawal period use confirm safety galantamine withdrawal subject group impact symptom improvement achieve first 18 week galantamine treatment ( symptom improvement would expect stabilize decline withdrawal effective therapy ) . The primary efficacy objective explore effect galantamine behavior measure Frontal Behavioral Inventory randomize withdrawal period . In addition , subject primary progressive aphasia ( limited ability language ) , effect galantamine language explore use Aphasia Quotient Western Aphasia Battery , subject Clinical Global Impressions use explore global change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Explore Safety Tolerability Galantamine HBr Treatment Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pick Complex ( PC ) Frontotemporal Dementia ( FTD ) group neurodegenerative dementia , initially characterized frontotemporal lobar atrophy , overlap clinical presentation pathologic finding . Although pathogenesis Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia remain unknown , neurotransmitter change Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia well characterize , evidence decrease cholinergic receptor bind several cortical region decrease serotonin binding hypothalamus , frontal cortex , temporal cortex . Galantamine reversible cholinesterase inhibitor . Recent study indicate galantamine also allosteric modulator nicotinic cholinergic receptor sit . This nicotinic modulation appear potentiate response acetylcholine binding , also modulate release several neurotransmitter , include serotonin . This pilot study explore safety tolerability efficacy galantamine 8 mg 12 mg twice day treatment subject Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia . The study comprise 18 week , open label , galantamine treatment phase follow 8 week , randomize , double blind , placebo control withdrawal phase . The safety tolerability galantamine therapy explore open label randomize withdrawal period . The 8 week randomize withdrawal period use confirm safety galantamine withdrawal subject group impact possible symptom improvement achieve open label period marker efficacy . The expectation subject remain galantamine additional 8 week continue improve remain stable regard behavior , language , cognition , global function , whereas subject assign placebo show decline function . This approach allow assessment effect galantamine treatment ( challenge ) galantamine withdrawal ( de-challenge ) . This study involve maximum 40 subject Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion receive galantamine 4 mg twice day 4 week follow 8 mg twice day 4 week . At 8 week , dose galantamine maintain 8 mg increase 12 mg twice day base tolerability . At end 12 week dose galantamine maintain 8 12 mg twice day reduce 8 mg twice day , base tolerability . The dose fixed remainder open label treatment period . Following 18 week galantamine treatment , subject randomly assign ( 1:1 ) continue treatment galantamine ( dose ) placebo additional 8 week . Subjects caregiver contact phone study encourage contact site time concern . If subject 's symptom appear substantially worsen , investigator determines subject deteriorate , advise subject caregiver possible early completion study ( early escape ) . Subjects elect early escape complete final efficacy safety assessment , discontinue study medication . Once complete study , begin treatment choice consultation physician . Subjects see assessment Visit 1 ( screen ) , Visit 2 ( baseline ) , Visits 3 4 ( 12 18 week start open label galantamine treatment ) , Visit 5 ( 8 week start double blind withdrawal period early escape ) upon premature discontinuation . The subject caregiver return unscheduled visit , judgment investigator , subject require clinical assessment visit . Subject selection criterion ensure inclusion subject clinical diagnosis Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia establish publish consensus criterion support neuroradiologic confirmation . The subject select study diagnosis primary progressive aphasia frontotemporal dementia . Safety tolerability monitor assessment adverse event , electrocardiogram , physical examination , blood pressure , heart rate , weight , laboratory test . Efficacy symptom explore measure change Frontal Behavioral Inventory ( FBI ) , Aphasia Quotient ( AQ ) Western Aphasia Battery ( WAB ) , Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ( MDRS ) , Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB ) , Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) , Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities Daily Living ( ADCS-ADL ) Scale , Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) Scales Severity Change , subscales WAB FBI . Changes result neurologic examination also document . The descriptive analysis perform , hypothesis specify statistical testing . Safety efficacy assessment summarize . Safety Efficacy change calculate screening/baseline galantamine treatment period Week 18 ( open label galantamine treatment period ) Week 26 ( entire study subject randomize galantamine 8 week withdrawal period ) . Comparisons placebo galantamine treatment group use change safety efficacy parameter Weeks 18 26 ( double blind , placebo control , randomize withdrawal period ) . Using flexible dose regimen , subject receive galantamine oral tablet 8 12 mg twice per day 18 week . Subjects randomly assign ( 1:1 ) double blind fashion galantamine dose placebo additional 8 week treatment .</detailed_description>
