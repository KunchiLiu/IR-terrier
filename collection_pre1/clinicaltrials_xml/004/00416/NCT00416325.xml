	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug substance keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use lycopene , substance find tomato , may keep prostate cancer form patient high risk develop prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose lycopene prevent prostate cancer patient high risk develop prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Define toxicity safety lycopene administer food-based delivery system chemoprevention agent patient high risk develop prostate cancer . - Define pharmacokinetics tissue distribution patient receive regimen . - Characterize surrogate endpoint biomarkers ( SEBs ) peripheral blood , buccal mucosa , prostate , provide evidence biological activity relevant chemoprevention effect . - Characterize oxidative stress state individual study DNA oxidation prostate buccal mucosa , well DNA oxidation lipid peroxidation within peripheral blood . - Define effect lycopene food delivery system prostate histology ( prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ) , marker cellular proliferation [ PCNA ] , apoptosis prostate . - Evaluate effect lycopene serum level total prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , free PSA , PSA density . - Provide basic knowledge reference toxicity , pharmacokinetics , SEBs need proceed large phase II III lycopene study patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral lycopene tomato paste olive oil , , twice , three time daily 3 month . Cohorts 6 patient receive escalate dos lycopene maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients undergo buccal scraping blood collection periodically study pharmacokinetics biomarker study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
