	<brief_summary>Mounting evidence support combine use manual physical therapy ( MPT ) exercise patient cervicogenic headache mechanical neck pain . However , insufficient evidence ass effectiveness MPT exercise patient neck disorder radicular symptom . Our purpose study determine effectiveness manual physical therapy exercise program compare minimal intervention approach treatment patient mechanical neck pain , without upper extremity symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior randomization , potential participant underwent standardized history examination cervical spine upper quarter . We collect demographic information include patient ’ age ; gender ; medication use ; image result ; location , nature , duration symptom . Self-report measure include NDI VAS pain scale . Physical exam measure include cervical range motion measurement gravity inclinometer , passive accessory motion test assess cervical spine segmental mobility pain provocation , upper quarter neurological screening , special test commonly use identify cervical impairment . Participants meet inclusion criterion randomize one two treatment group : 1 ) manual physical therapy exercise ( MTE ) 2 ) minimal intervention ( MI ) . Patients MTE group receive manual physical therapy intervention specifically target impairment identified physical examination . Physical therapist choose manual intervention consist thrust non-thrust joint manipulation/mobilization , muscle energy , soft-tissue mobilization/stretching technique commonly reference used clinical practice . We provide patient MTE group standard home exercise program cervical retraction , deep neck flexor strengthening , cervical rotation range motion exercise . Patients MI group receive basic treatment plan consistent general practitioner care . We provide patient basic regimen postural advice , encouragement maintain neck motion daily activity level , cervical rotation range motion exercise , instruction continue prescribe medication use . Minimalist physical therapy treatment consist sub-therapeutic pulsed ( 10 % ) ultrasound 0.1w/cm2 10 minute apply cervical spine cervical rotation range motion exercise . We provide treatment maintain patient ’ expectation physical therapy treatment subsequent improvement , standardize therapist-patient interaction time The intervention period last 3 week group receive treatment twice weekly 6 session . We standardize treatment time group use one-hour initial evaluation treatment session thirty-minute follow-up treatment session . Patients complete six visit symptom fully resolve . The treat therapist instruct supervised exercise ensure proper patient technique understand . We collect outcome measure data baseline patient 's 3-week , 6-week 1-year follow-up . All outcome measure collect physical therapist blind treatment group allocation .</detailed_description>
