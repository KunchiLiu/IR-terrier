	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study determine maximum tolerate dose E2007 . Epilepsy patient refractory partial seizure divide two group 24 patient . One group patient take concomitant inducing AEDs ( anti-epileptic drug ) second group patient take concomitant inducing AEDs . In group , 18 patient receive E2007 ( dose escalate maximum 12 mg per day ) six receive placebo .</brief_summary>
