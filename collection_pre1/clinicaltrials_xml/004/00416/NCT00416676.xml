	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , cisplatin , etoposide , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving combination chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase III trial study well give combination chemotherapy surgery without radiation therapy work treat patient stage 2 stage 3 neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Surgery With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage 2 Stage 3 Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine acute late toxicity local radiotherapy give vincristine , cisplatin , etoposide , cyclophosphamide ( OPEC ) alternate vincristine , carboplatin , etoposide , cyclophosphamide ( OJEC ) chemotherapy surgery follow chemotherapy patient stage 2B 3 neuroblastoma . - Determine response patient treat alternate OPEC OJEC chemotherapy surgery . - Determine local control event-free overall survival patient achieve complete response chemotherapy surgery alone . - Determine local control event-free overall survival patient achieve complete response chemotherapy surgery subsequently receive local radiotherapy . - Determine clinical biological prognostic factor patient stage 2B 3 neuroblastoma treat approach . OUTLINE : This pilot , multicenter study . Patients receive OPEC chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 , cisplatin IV continuously 24 hour day 1 , etoposide IV 4 hour day 3 course 1 , 3 , 5 . Patients receive OJEC chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV , cyclophosphamide IV , etoposide IV 4 hour , carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 course 2 4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 5 course . After 5 course , patient resectable disease undergo surgical resection . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) , either surgery 5 course chemotherapy alone ( surgery possible ) , receive 2 additional course chemotherapy ( OPEC follow OJEC ) . Patients achieve CR undergo radiotherapy 3 week . During first week radiotherapy , patient also receive vincristine IV day 1 etoposide IV 4 hour day 1 2 . Beginning 3 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive 2 additional course chemotherapy ( OPEC follow OJEC ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
