	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , interleukin-2 interferon , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . It yet know whether interleukin-2 give infusion effective interleukin-2 give injection combine interferon treat metastatic kidney cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study interleukin-2 give infusion see well work compare interleukin-2 give injection combine interferon treat patient metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Interferon Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall survival patient metastatic renal cell cancer treat intravenous v subcutaneous interleukin-2 combination interferon alfa . Secondary - Compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare response rate ( complete partial ) patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , parallel-group , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive induction therapy comprise interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) IV continuously day 1-5 , 15-19 , 43-47 , 57-61 ( week 1 , 3 , 7 , 9 ) interferon alfa ( IFN-α ) subcutaneously ( SC ) three time weekly week 1-3 7-9 . Patients undergo restaging . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) receive maintenance therapy comprise IL-2 IV continuously 5 day IFN-α SC three time weekly week 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 . - Arm II : Patients receive induction therapy comprise IL-2 SC twice daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 ( week 1-4 ) . Patients also receive IFN-α SC three time weekly week 1-4 6-9 . Patients undergo restaging . Patients achieve CR , PR , SD receive maintenance therapy comprise IL-2 SC induction therapy IFN-α SC three time weekly week 1-4 8-11 . Quality life assess baseline , end induction therapy , end maintenance therapy . After completion treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 220 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically confirm metastatic renal cell adenocarcinoma More one resectable metastatic site No unresectable lesion local curative treatment ( i.e. , radiotherapy ) In case secondary lesion suspect image ( &lt; 1 cm and/or sparse lesion ) , metastatic disease must confirm biopsy OR disease progression document image perform several week If patient know prior metastatic lesion , progressive disease must confirm within past 3 month noninvasive technique Nephrectomized Measurable evaluable disease No brain metastasis PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Karnofsky performance status 90100 % Hematocrit ≥ 30 % WBC ≥ 4,000/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 120,000/mm^3 Bilirubin normal Creatinine ≤ 1.7 mg/dL FEV_1 ≥ 50 % No severe cardiac dysfunction ( i.e. , grade III/IV heart disease ) , include follow : Congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease Uncontrolled hypertension Severe arrhythmia No active infection require antibiotic treatment No severe neuropsychiatric condition No geographical , psychological , familial condition would preclude study treatment Not pregnant nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective contraception LVEF ≥ 50 % No severe autoimmune disease No known chronic hepatitis No HIV positivity No hepatitis B surface antigen positivity No prior concurrent cancer , except basal cell skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix No severe pulmonary , hepatic , renal condition would preclude study treatment PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics At least 6 week since prior widefield radiotherapy No prior allograft No prior cytokine chemotherapy No concurrent corticosteroid</criteria>
