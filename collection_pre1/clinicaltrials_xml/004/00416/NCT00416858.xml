	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy together combination chemotherapy see well work without surgery treating patient locally advanced esophageal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Combination Chemotherapy With Without Surgery Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare survival patient locally advanced esophageal cancer treat neoadjuvant radiotherapy chemotherapy comprise fluorouracil cisplatin follow surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender , histology ( epidermoid v glandular ) , response induction therapy ( complete vs partial ) , tumor differentiation ( little differentiate v undifferentiated/good v moderately differentiate ) . - Induction therapy : All patient receive induction therapy comprise fluorouracil IV continuously 24 hour day 1-5 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1-5 day 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo radiotherapy twice daily day 1-5 22-26 daily 5 day week 4½ week . Patients achieve complete partial response randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo surgery . Patients may receive 1 course adjuvant chemotherapy ( induction therapy ) undergo additional radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients receive additional fluoroucacil cisplatin induction therapy . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo additional radiotherapy daily 5 day week 2 week . Quality life assess baseline , treatment arm I II , every 2 month ( arm I ) every 6 month ( arm II ) thereafter . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
