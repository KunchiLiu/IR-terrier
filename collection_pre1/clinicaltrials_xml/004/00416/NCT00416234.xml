	<brief_title>Laparoendoscopic Rendez Vous Versus Standard Two Stage Approach Management Cholelithiasis/Choledocholithiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ideal management concomitant cholelithiasis choledocholithiasis know yet . There several option , include one-stage two-stage approach . The commonly used practice two-stage management consist preoperative ERCP , sphincterotomy CBD clearance follow laparoscopic cholecystectomy . However , approach , number patient submit unnecessary ERCP others develop complication , mainly pancreatitis due inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation . Laparo-endoscopic rendez-vous method describe order obtain selective CBD cannulation omit risk post-ERCP pancreatitis . In procedure , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , wire insert cystic duct common bile duct , advance duodenum find endoscopically , grip snare retrieve mouth . The sphincterotome insert wire elective CBD cannulation obtain follow sphincterotomy CBD clearance intraoperatively . The method describe several author small moderate case series , safety proven appear reduce length hospital stay incidence post-ERCP pancreatitis.However , popularize never test standard two-stage management . In hospital , standard approach cholelithiasis choledocholithiasis , well , two-stage ( preop ERCP sphincterotomy follow laparoscopic cholecystectomy ) approach . We initially assess feasibility safety laparo-endoscopic rendez vous pilot study intend compare two method prospective randomize trial .</detailed_description>
