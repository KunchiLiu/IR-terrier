	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect protect early weightbearing ( PEWB ) compare non-weightbearing ( NWB ) surgery Achilles tendon rupture ( ATR ) health relate quality life ( HRQL ) initial six week period surgery , functional recovery time , return work activity complication . We hypothesize PEWB follow ATR repair would result : ) improve HRQL initial postoperative period , ii ) , quick recovery HRQL , strength endurance , iii ) early return work sport , iv ) increase complication , re-rupture compare NWB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Protected Early Weightbearing Versus Non-Weightbearing After Surgery Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achilles tendon rupture ( ATR ) commonly treat open surgical repair . Following surgical repair , variety protocol , range complete immobilization immediate postoperative mobilization early weightbearing . However , clear consensus regard optimal postoperative rehabilitation protocol ATRs exist . Early rehabilitation ATR show beneficial animal human study . Human prospective study randomize controlled trial show early postoperative mobilization pose additional risk compare cast immobilization , trend toward reduction lose work day earlier return sport . However , trial define early postoperative mobilization differently ( i.e . use different combination weightbearing range motion ) . This make difficult determine factor early rehabilitation process play important role optimize recovery . An important component early rehabilitation weightbearing . Comparison : Patients weightbearing early rehabilitation period surgical repair Achilles tendon compare patient non-weightbearing surgical repair Achilles tendon repair . With exception weightbearing status , group perform rehabilitation program .</detailed_description>
