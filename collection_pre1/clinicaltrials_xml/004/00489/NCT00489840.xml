	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy With Open-Label Anecortave Acetate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) disease macula characterize loss vision exudation fluid retina localize posterior pole . Acute central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) define idiopathic detachment neurosensory retina macular region associate focal leak level retinal pigment epithelium fluorescein angiography . This area leakage usually correspond defect retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) . An acute episode CSC usually resolve within 3 month time onset almost total restoration visual acuity . However , severe form disease , chronic central serous chorioretinopathy , diffuse decompensation RPE , recurrent retinal detachment , progressive loss visual acuity . Indocyanine green angiography show diffuse hyperpermeability choriocapillaris layer . This chronic form CSC usually bilateral , often cause severe vision loss impair quality life patient . Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy define basis two factor : 1 ) persistence detachment 6 month 2 ) chronic recurrent acute detachment widespread decompensation retinal pigment epithelium . The standard care acute CSC observation period 3 month . If complete resolution retinal detachment 3 month , focal laser photocoagulation therapy may use treat area leakage . This treatment usually effective stop leakage fluid retina cause resolution detachment . However , laser photocoagulation therapy beneficial treatment chronic CSC single easily identifiable point leakage rather diffuse disease RPE , thus render laser treatment ineffective . Because limitation laser photocoagulation chronic CSC , treatment currently evaluation . Corticosteroids appear intimately related pathogenesis disease . Exogenous corticosteroid show induce disease via variety route , whether oral , intravenous , intranasal , intraarticular . Secondly , patient endogenous hypercortisolism , Cushing 's syndrome type A personality , also increase risk develop disease . The purpose medical research study evaluate Anecortave Acetate approach may benefit patient chronic CSC . Anecortave acetate novel agent , derive steroid cortisone , modify eliminate glucocorticoid effect via removal 11Î²-hydroxyl group , addition double bond C9-11 , addition acetate group C21 increase ocular penetration stability . Anecortave acetate recently show possess anti-glucocorticoid effect eye , block steroid-induced glaucoma . Anecortave acetate treatment eye evaluate disorder , macular degneration , boast outstanding safety record , adverse systemic reaction . Ocular adverse event mild , subconjunctival hemorrhage . The concept protocol Anecortave Acetate block steroid receptor glaucoma prevents steroid-induced glaucoma , perhaps block steroid induced receptor involve pathogenesis central serous chorioretinopathy . If successful , modality treatment may reduce risk progressive visual damage due chronic CSC perhaps even improve visual function without cause destruction overlie neurosensory retina .</detailed_description>
