	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness vaccine prevent avian influenza ( bird flu ) . About 25 50 million case influenza occur year U.S. , lead 150,000 hospitalization 30,000 40,000 death . Globally , pandemic influenza may 1 billion flu case , 3 5 million case severe illness half million death annually . There potential threat pandemic emerge virus strain population little preexisting immunity . Avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) viruses cause serious disease emerge recently , affect domestic wild bird population . Patients age 18 60 good health pregnant breast feeding may eligible study . The study do NIH Clinical Center staff Vaccine Research Center . It last 32 week person . A traditional needle needle-free device call Biojector 2000 use . Intramuscular ( muscle ) subcutaneous ( fat skin ) delivery vaccine via Biojector clear use Food Drug Administration consider investigational . Intradermal ( skin ) delivery vaccine Biojector study deem investigational evaluated human , find safe well tolerated trial . There 10 clinic visit study , important stay schedule . Visits 2 hour , though injection day , visit 4 hour . Injections give day 0 week 4 8 . The vaccine give injection skin upper arm . Clinic staff observe patient 30 minute vaccination . One 2 day first injection , clinic visit . One 3 day second third injection , patient need telephone clinic staff report . Patients complete diary card home , record temperature symptom , look injection site daily 5 day . Patients report side effect one study physicians nurse soon possible . They return clinic 2 week injection . A needle-free system use pressure carbon dioxide , instead needle , inject vaccine skin . Discomfort result either needle-free device needle . There may sting , pain , soreness , swell , bruising , small cut skin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Open-Label Study Recombinant DNA Plasmid Vaccine , VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP , Encoding Influenza Virus H5 Hemagglutinin Protein Given Intradermally</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity recombinant DNA vaccine influenza virus H5 hemagglutinin intradermal ( ID ) delivery . The hypothesis vaccine safe human administration ID delivery either needle/syringe Biojector elicit antibody T cell response H5 protein . Primary objective evaluate safety tolerability vaccine 500 microgram ID administer needle syringe Biojector 1 mg ID administer Biojector two injection different arm healthy adult . Secondary exploratory objective related immunogenicity . Product Description : The vaccine compose single closed-circular DNA plasmid encodes H5 protein CMV/R promoter . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each injection 125 microliters ( 500 microgram ) administer ID deltoid muscle use BiojectorÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) needle syringe . Subjects : A total 40 healthy adult , age 18-60 year enrol . Study Plan : Subjects simultaneously randomize ratio 1:1:1:1 one four group show schema . The protocol require ten clinic visit three telephone follow-up contact . Study Duration : Each participant complete 32 week clinical follow . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety tolerability regimen . The secondary immunogenicity endpoint H5-specific antibody measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) assay H5 neutralize antibody assay Study Week 12 . Other immunogenicity assay timepoints throughout study may also complete exploratory evaluation .</detailed_description>
