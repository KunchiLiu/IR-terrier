	<brief_title>Persistence Study GSK Biologicals ' Tdap Vaccine 1 , 3 , 5 9 Years Following Administration Initial Single Dose Healthy Young Adults Evaluate Immunogenicity Safety Boostrix Second Dose Tdap , When Administered Year 9</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects previously vaccinate either Boostrix control Tdap vaccine ( Sanofi Pasteurs ' Adacel ) study NCT00346073 . Only subject part primary study invite participate study . All subject receive single dose Boostrix Visit 6 ( Day 0 ) subject observe till Visit 7 ( Day 30 ) safety term solicit adverse event ( 4 day post vaccination ) , unsolicited adverse event ( 31 day post vaccination ) serious adverse event ( trial period ) . A blood sample collect subject vaccination ( Visit 6 ) one month vaccination ( Visit 7 ) antibody estimation . This summary update follow Protocol amendment 1 date 09 November 2010 , amendment 2 date 18 February 2014 , amendment 3 date 10 December 2014 . The protocol amend first due follow reason : 1 . The maximum window period allow return subject Year 5 Year 10 follow-up visit ( Visit 5 Visit 6 ) extend ± 5 week ± 8 week . 2 . The contact detail report SAEs clarify . 3 . Text pertain report spontaneous abortion remove protocol . 4 . The number attempt contact subject return schedule persistence visit clarify . The main purpose protocol amendment 2 evaluate immunogenicity safety Boostrix second dose Tdap vaccine administer 8 year initial dose Tdap . The Year 10 time point evaluation persistence cancel longer feasible conduct second dose Tdap vaccine administer Year 8 . The purpose amendment 3 add co-primary objective demonstrate immune response elicit second dose Tdap vaccine , Boostrix ( Boostrix group Adacel group ) non-inferior immune response elicit first dose Tdap vaccine ( Control group ) , respect booster response diphtheria , tetanus pertussis ( PT , FHA PRN ) antigens , one month follow vaccination accord CBER 's input . Accordingly , study start push Year 9 reflect throughout document .</detailed_description>
