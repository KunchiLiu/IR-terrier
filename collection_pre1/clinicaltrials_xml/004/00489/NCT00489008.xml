	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) help control NSCLC . The safety SBRT also study . Objectives : To assess therapeutic efficacy toxicity stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) patient medically inoperable stage I ( T1-2 , N0 , M0 ) , selective stage II ( chest wall T3 , N0M0 ) isolate peripheral lung recurrent non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Primary goal : Improve 2 year progression free survival treat primary tumor site . Secondary goal : 1 . Improve disease free survival , disease specific survival overall survival 2 year . 2 . Decrease grade 3 acute and/or chronic toxicity . 3 . Collect blood future biomarkers study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SRS Study Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stereotactic body radiotherapy design provide image guide , focus , dose escalate radiotherapy shorter time frame ( 1 week rather 7 week ) conventional radiation therapy . The goal SBRT improve tumor control reduce side effect . If find eligible take part study , receive daily SBRT 4 day row 45 minute time period . During treatment , lie still table 45 minute per day position . The machine deliver dose accord plan develop doctor dose control computer . During treatment , see doctor research nurse week evaluate possible side effect . A physical exam medical history do visit . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . You follow-up visit 6 week completion radiotherapy check side effect . You continue follow-up visit decrease frequency time . You image test ( chest CT PET scan ) routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) follow-up visit . This investigational study . SBRT FDA approve treatment lung cancer . About 138 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Cohort 1 : Histologically cytologically document NSCLC . 2 . Cohort 1 : Inoperable stage IA ( T1N0MO ) , IB ( T2N0MO ) selective stage II ( T3 due chest wall involvement , N0M0 ) . Patient refuse surgery eligible . Secondary lung cancer eligible primary cancer cure stable life expectance longer 2 year . If primary cancer lung cancer , patient need lung cancer free 5 year histology 2 year different histology . 3 . Cohort 1 : Patients hilar mediastinal lymph node &lt; = 1cm abnormal hilar mediastinal uptake PET consider N0 . Patients &gt; 1 cm hilar mediastinal lymph node CT abnormal PET ( include suspicious ondiagnostic uptake ) may still eligible directed tissue biopsy abnormally identify area negative cancer . Patient receive induction chemotherapy systemic therapy eligible . 4 . Cohort 1 : Performance score KPS 60100 . 5 . Cohort 2 : Histologically cytologically document NSCLC . 6 . Cohort 2 : Inoperable isolated lung parenchyma recurrent NSCLC without evidence lymph node mediastinal involvement ( clinical stage T12 , chest wall involvement T3 , N0M0 ) surgical resection definitive radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy . Recurrent disease define NSCLC histology , lobe recurs within 5 year initial definitive therapy . Patient refuse surgery also eligible . Patient receive systemic therapy eligible . 7 . Cohort 2 : Performance score KPS 60100 . 8 . Cohort 3 : Histologically cytologically document NSCLC . 9 . Cohort 3 : Previous history NSCLC cure stable . New development inoperable isolate lung parenchyma lesion document histologically cytologically NSCLC without evidence lymph node mediastinal involvement ( clinical stage T12 , chest wall involvement T3 , N0M0 ) eligible cohort 1 recurrent disease define Cohort 2 . This include NSCLC happen within 5 year initial definitive treatment prior NSCLC , and/or locate different lobe . 10 . ( cont . ) Cohort 3 : Possible stage IV disease eligible long meet criterion since definitive way confirm . Patient refuse surgery eligible . Patient receive systemic therapy eligible . 11 . Cohort 3 : Performance score KPS 60100 . 1 . Any tumor involve main bronchus , major vessel , heart , esophagus , trachea , carina , spinal cord . 2 . Any tumor cause collapse lobe lung . 3 . Any tumor malignant pleural effusion . 4 . Direct evidence hilar , mediastinal lymph node distant metastasis base stag work . 5 . Pregnancy . Patients ( men woman ) child bear potential use effective ( ) method birth control throughout participation study .</criteria>
