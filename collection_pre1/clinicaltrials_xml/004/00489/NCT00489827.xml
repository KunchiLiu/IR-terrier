	<detailed_description>Myocardial preservation cardiac surgery mainly focus period heart arrest ( cross-clamp time ) . Today heart arrest 2-3 hour without major consequence . However , spite comparatively short cross-clamp time approximately 10 % patient undergoing coronary surgery sustain significant myocardial injury whereas perioperative myocardial infarction rare aortic valve surgery despite long cross-clamp time . The reason preoperative ischemia , extent postoperative ischemia , remain major risk factor development myocardial infarction patient ischemic heart disease . In light , suggest effort improve outcome reduce permanent myocardial damage focus preoperative postoperative phase coronary surgery . Furthermore , effort institute reduce reperfusion injury minimize permanent myocardial damage long-standing severe myocardial ischemia . Metabolic intervention intravenous glutamate infusion , offer prospect address issue extend myocardial protection pre- postoperative phase . Glutamate important substrate intermediary metabolism heart , particularly association ischemia . The effect glutamate partly relate role malate-aspartate shuttle , transport reduce equivalent across mitochondrial membrane , regulate NAD/NADH balance cytosol cell , thereby enhance anaerobic glycolysis ischemia . Furthermore , glutamate contributes alternative anaerobic pathway regeneration high-energy phosphate , substrate level phosphorylation Krebs cycle . Glutamate also improve clearance metabolic waste produce ischemia lactate NH3 , take part reaction involve transamination pyruvate alanine glutamate glutamine . During reperfusion glutamate contributes replenishment Krebs cycle intermediate lose ischemia , essential recovery oxidative metabolism . Administration glutamate patient stable angina pectoris find increase tolerance stress-induced ischemia . Ischemia onset cardiopulmonary bypass establish major risk factor postoperative myocardial infarction . Patients unstable coronary artery disease may critical ischemia rest particularly vulnerable increase oxygen demand early stage coronary surgery . In pilot study patient operate urgently unstable angina find metabolic sign compatible improve tolerance ischemia surgery improve recovery oxidative metabolism early reperfusion . These result warrant study evaluate potential clinical benefit preoperative glutamate infusion extend early postoperative period . Comparisons : Intravenous infusion 0.125 M glutamic acid solution v saline rate 1.65 ml/hour kg body weight begin institution anesthesia stop 2 hour unclamping aorta patient operate unstable coronary artery disease . Preliminary power analysis ( 80 % power ; p &lt; 0.05 ) suggest 2214 patient require regard primary end-point assume 30 % reduction event occur 12 % untreated patient . Stage I study comprises 800 patients* lead interim analysis report secondary end-points** recalculation sample-size regard primary end-point . An adaptive design regard primary end-point analysis perform external statistician blind investigator use avoid increase risk type I error . *Patient number 800 anticipate enrol summer 2009 practical reason patient enrol end August 2009 comprise interim analysis . **Secondary end-points include analysis marker myocardial injury ( CK-MB , troponin-T ) , marker hemodynamic adequacy ( mixed venous oxygen saturation ) , renal function ( p-creatinine , p-Cystatin C ) , brain injury ( S100B , clinical sign ) . As substudy blind analysis value NT-pro BNP ( obtain immediately surgery , 24 hour postoperatively 3rd postoperative day ) marker postoperative heart failure outcome conduct . NT-pro BNP also relate treatment glutamate placebo . Similar evaluation involve marker troponin-T , p-Cystatin C mixed venous oxygen saturation . For detail see outcome measure . Substudies involve subgroup analyse patient regard combine CABG + valve procedure , severely unstable patient require emergency surgery / intravenous nitrate , preoperative LV-dysfunction patient diabetes .
