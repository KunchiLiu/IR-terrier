	<brief_title>Study Quality Life Prostate Proton Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer tend well control high dos radiation . These high dos may lead side effect . Standard radiation therapy use x-ray , effective may cause extra radiation dose give tissue beyond tumor , rectum bladder . Unlike x-ray , proton ( small positively-charged particle ) deliver radiation dose specific target suddenly deliver much less dose beyond target . This minimize dose normal tissue may lead few side effect , even high dos deliver tumor . If agree take part study , involve complete quality life questionnaire , , proton therapy . You ask tolerate proton therapy , ( ) side effect experience , treatment impact quality life . The questionnaire take 15 minute complete . They may do person , mail , phone . You complete questionnaire proton therapy begin last week therapy . You also repeat questionnaire 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month proton therapy , every 6 month next 3 year , every year next 6 year . If receive hormone therapy , also ask fill questionnaire begin hormone therapy . During radiation course , brief weekly clinic visit assess side effect visit part normal standard practice . Your information compile information people treat similarly , good understand effect prostate proton radiation therapy . Throughout course radiation therapy , brief clinic visit week part standard care . You check side effect . Your participation study mail back last questionnaire . This investigational study . Up 1084 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
