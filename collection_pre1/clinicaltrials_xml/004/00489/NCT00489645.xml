	<brief_title>Effect Hyperglycemia Gastric Emptying Interactions With Pramlintide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postprandial increase plasma glucose concentration mainly determine degree postprandial suppression endogenous glucose production rate appearance ingest glucose . The latter predominantly determine amount glucose take splanchnic bed . Because nutrient absorption depend gastric nutrient delivery , gastric empty rate key determinant early rise plasma glucose postprandially . At mealtime , fast stomach empty rapid rise plasma glucose . Yet , plasma glucose concentration determinant gastric empty rate . In non-diabetic subject , plasma glucose rise approach upper limit normal range ( ~140 mg/dl ) , gastric emptying slows . This likely represent physiological brake mechanism limit excess delivery nutrient , thus avoid excessive appearance glucose plasma . In diabetes , abnormally accelerate gastric empty well delay gastric empty report . These conflict data may explain difference ambient glycaemia . In study undertake diabetic subject patient severely hyperglycaemic , thus report delayed gastric emptying may explain effect hyperglycaemia gastric motility . Indeed , small number study control ambient glycaemia find acceleration gastric empty diabetes suggest diabetes manifest maladaptive acceleration gastric empty likely contribute excessive postprandial plasma glucose excursion . The amylin analog pramlintide potential new therapeutic elicits potent glucose lower effect postprandial period think due suppression plasma glucagon delay gastric emptying . It clear , however , extent pramlintide-induced delay gastric empty offset potential maladaptive acceleration gastric empty diabetes patient study controlled glycemic condition . In theory , every drug reduce hyperglycaemia accelerate gastric emptying , thereby , minimize potential effect postprandial hyperglycaemia . Thus , drug-induced effect amylin gastric motility may great advantage offset effect glycemic induced acceleration gastric emptying .</detailed_description>
