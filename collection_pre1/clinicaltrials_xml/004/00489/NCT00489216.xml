	<brief_title>Efalizumab Treating Patients With Graft-Versus-Host Disease Skin That Did Not Respond Previous Steroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess general safety efalizumab patient cutaneous graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) . - Study feasibility digital imaging objectively quantify cutaneous GVHD . - Evaluate feasibility serial skin biopsy monitor disease response efalizumab patient cutaneous GVHD . Secondary - Assess overall complete response rate patient treat drug . - Assess overall cutaneous response rate ( complete cutaneous response rate partial cutaneous response rate ) patient treat drug . - Assess overall hepatic response rate ( complete hepatic response rate partial hepatic response rate ) patient treat drug . - Assess duration response observe . - Assess effect drug overall patient survival . - Use preliminary efficacy toxicity data collect small exploratory study decide appropriateness large , subsequent phase II trial formally assess toxicity efficacy drug patient population . - Collect pharmacokinetic data drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive efalizumab subcutaneously weekly 8 week ( total 8 dos ) . Digital photograph body region take determination disease involve body surface area . Skin biopsy obtain treatment analyzed lymphocyte function associate antigen ( LFA-1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM-1 ) , cluster differentiation 4 , 8 , possibly 20 ( CD4 , CD8 , CD20 ) immunohistochemistry . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 9 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Skin disease Patients must demonstrate evidence erythematous maculopapular rash felt clinically consistent graftversushost disease . Patients must undergo skin biopsy prior enrollment . Because pathological finding GVHD may equivocal ( 6 ) biopsy felt consistent GVHD consider adequate . Consider sclerodermatous skin change may present adequate enrollment . Patients must exhibit sign active inflammatory rash . 2 . Liver disease • Although hepatic involvement require study participation , patient concomitant GVHD liver encourage enroll . All patient hepatic GVHD must also demonstrate cutaneous disease . Patients liver dysfunction encourage require undergo hepatic biopsy order document liver injury result GVHD . Patients pretreatment serum bilirubin ≥ 2.0 mg/dL biopsyconfirmed cutaneous GVHD assume demonstrate hepatic GVHD cause liver function test ( LFT ) elevation identify . 3 . Age ≥ 18 year 4 . Patients must ≥ 30 day remove allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant order allow engraftment . Patients receive peripheral blood stem cell and/or bone marrow eligible , regardless degree human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) matching . 5 . Steroid refractory disease • All patient must demonstrate evidence steroid refractory graftversus host disease skin liver . In effort conform standard definition steroid refractory disease , base criterion describe large intergroup trial examine effectiveness pentostatin steroid refractory chronic GVHD ( 31 ) . Because present study , however , design include patient acute chronic GVHD base traditional disease classification criterion , require time interval necessary define steroidrefractoriness shorten . Patients consider steroid refractory one follow condition meet : Worsening skin liver disease despite 1 week equivalent 1mg/kg methylprednisolone Failure achieve 50 % reduction body surface area involve GVHD 50 % reduction total serum bilirubin 4 week equivalent least 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone Requirement ≥ equivalent 0.5mg/kg methylprednisolone maintain response 8 week steroid therapy Patients progression cutaneous hepatic GVHD prior history treatment least 8 week corticosteroid require reintroduction corticosteroid ( &gt; equivalent 10mg/day methylprednisolone ) Patients GVHD improve progress alternative immunosuppressive agent eligible steroid refractoriness establish previously 6 . Required initial laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1000/μL Platelet count ≥ 20,000/μL Serum creatinine ≤ 3.0 mg/dL 1 . Nonpregnant nonnursing • Treatment protocol would expose unborn child significant risk . Women men reproductive potential must agree use effective mean birth control . 2 . No HIV infection PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics At least 2 terminal halflives since prior concurrent infliximab , daclizumab , etanercept , rituximab , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , denileukin diftitox</criteria>
