	<brief_summary>An echocardiogram , also call cardiac ultrasound echo , medical test take picture heart use sound wave . It show image structure heart without use radiation . During last year , FDA approve new technology call Speckle Tracking look heart wall motion contraction ( pump squeeze ) abnormality . The study also employ tissue Doppler 3-Dimensional echo use echocardiographic machine use right . The machine upgrade new software application . This new technology currently use adult , unfortunately , almost publish data normal heart function infant child use technology . It known technology develop child 's heart adult . The investigator wish study new technology compare technology currently use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study do primarily software analysis . The investigator wish enroll total 70 patient age newborn 17 year old . The patient divide three group : ( 1 ) 0-2 year ( 2 ) 2-10 year ( 3 ) 10-17 year age . 59 patient normal volunteer - sibling patient receive routine echo sibling patient caregiver Children 's Healthcare Atlanta . The investigator age-match patient twenty patient know suspected heart muscle dysfunction ( work properly ) already schedule routine echo . For patient schedule routine echo , patient parent/guardian approach prior routine echo perform . If consent/assent , take additional 10-15 minute obtain research image routine image obtain . The healthy volunteer screen sibling patient receive routine echo sibling patient caregiver , study explain informed consent/assent obtain . It take approximately 30 minute obtain research image . By study new technology , investigator able find whether able give u useful information heart muscle contract , coordination contraction may indicate new area treatment .</detailed_description>
