	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction New Zealand house relatively poorly construct maintain temperate climate home heat less WHO recommend minimum winter temperature 18°C . Excess winter mortality comparable level Portugal Scotland . The Group ’ previous Housing , Insulation Health Study show insulate exist home lead small significant improvement health energy consumption , raise question whether instal sustainable heating could increase gain . 2 . Study design We enrol 409 household , use either plug-in electric heater unflued gas heating , child asthma , age 6 12 year . In winter 2005 , uninsulated house insulate baseline measure take indoor temperature live room child ’ bedroom , level nitrogen dioxide . Intensive monitoring indoor air quality carry sub-sample 33 home . All member child ’ family fill detailed questionnaire health heads-of -household complete questionnaire characteristic household ’ energy usage . Objective measure also collect household ’ fuel bill , child ’ attendance school family ’ health care utilisation . Households randomise intervention group choice new , efficient sustainable heater ( heat pump , wood pellet burner , flued gas heater ) heat house emit internal emission instal summer . In winter 2006 , follow-up measure take control households receive choice new heater .</detailed_description>
