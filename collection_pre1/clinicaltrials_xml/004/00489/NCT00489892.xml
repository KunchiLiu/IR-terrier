	<brief_summary>This study design examine effect wake-promoting agent ( Modafinil ) work memory ( WM ) person moderate severe TBI utilize double blind placebo control methodology . Our approach evaluate participant BOLD fMRI limit neuropsychological battery examine WM performance pharmacological intervention . Hypotheses 1 . Because increased cognitive effort ( function decrease efficiency TBI ) presume underlie fMRI activation dispersion see central executive WM task , anticipate attenuation cerebral activation prefrontal cortex pharmacological intervention Modafinil compare placebo administration mPASAT vigilance test . 2 . There correlation decrease dispersion fMRI signal scan improvement neuropsychological measure individual Modafinil see take placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Work institution show moderate severe TBI subject demonstrate altered cerebral representation attempt process verbal WM task . Specifically , data show post-TBI pattern activation disperse lateralize right hemisphere , compare healthy control . Taken together , interpret finding mean require cerebral resource TBI subject process task previously automatic . In word , process less efficient . This consistent TBI patient â€™ self-reports need expend great cognitive effort perform task , lab everyday life . Our preliminary data first step understand cerebral substrate difficulty . However , simply indicate individual TBI WM problem enough . The development target intervention ameliorate deficit next step treatment process . The present proposal important implication TBI rehabilitation . One major goal cognitive remediation help TBI patient learn new information accurately efficiently , improve performance activity everyday life . 123 Because WM impairment prevalent TBI , present study help shed light potential treatment alternative potentially devastate problem . In spite prevalence popularity cognitive remediation strategy procedure , remain little empirical support efficacy , virtually understand underlie neurocognitive process facilitate intervention . The ability develop potentially efficacious treatment modality , solid foundation , would immensely beneficial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We include subject sustain moderate severe initial injury , define initial 24hour Glasgow Coma Scale 128 score 13 . In event GCS score available , subject include sufficient medical documentation would allow posthoc estimation initial GCS , confirmatory data ( e.g. , positive anatomic neuroimaging finding , focal neurologic sign ) available . Individuals history prior moderate severe head injury , stroke , seizure , severe psychiatric disturbance ( i.e. , know influence memory performance , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder ) , drug abuse include subject . In addition , score 11 great Mini Mental Status Exam require insure subject participate effectively study protocol . Because potential effect cognition hemodynamic response , subject currently take benzodiazepine , narcotic , neuroleptic , anticonvulsant , antispasticity agent psychostimulants include . In addition , patient medication may interact study medication ( e.g . birth control bill cyclosporin ) . Psychiatric symptoms substance abuse history obtain use structured psychiatric interview , Diagnostic Interview Schedule 129DIS . In addition patient history drug dependency , hypertension control , significant cardiac disease , inability undergo MRI . ( e.g . metalworker , Medtronic infusion pump )</criteria>
