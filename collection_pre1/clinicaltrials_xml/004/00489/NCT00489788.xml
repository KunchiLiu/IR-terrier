	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) non-invasive test look heart without use radiation . An MRI allow doctor look heart order ass well ventricle pump , amount blood pump addition much stretch . An engineer Georgia Tech develop new way look MRI . It believe new way look MRI may better able tell u replace valve child . If new process work , apply able look previously perform MRIs gather information child heart function order help child future . We plan enrol 30 subject study . Some subject enrol MRI strictly purpose study . Some subject already schedule routine MRI heart ask extra image study already .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Pulmonary Valve Replacement - Anatomic Hemodynamic Using MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause morbidity death Western World . Assessment Myocardial function proven clinically relevant method monitoring evaluate outcomes medical therapy surgery structural lesion acquire disease . Tetralogy Fallot ( TOF ) common form cyanotic congenital heart disease prevalence 0.26 0.8 per 1000 live birth The current surgical approach favor primary repair infancy . This decrease necessity palliative procedure low operative mortality . Complete repair often result pulmonary regurgitation ( PR ) , generally well tolerated infancy . Late complication may include ventricular dilatation , tricuspid regurgitation , diastolic systolic dysfunction , arrhythmias sudden cardiac death . Pulmonary valve replacement ( PVR ) require approximately 20 % patient repair TOF 1-4 % peri-operative mortality . Thus , early intervention may reduce irreversible right ventricle injury ; however definitive tool presently available determine patient risk . Myocardial strain analysis critically evaluate determine value predict RV failure . This study investigate practicality accuracy novel mathematical method , develop investigator , analysis cardiac deformation recovery dynamic Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CMRI ) sequence . The propose method require structural MRI data , offer several important advantage exist method . These include reduced requirement image time analysis effort , option use large database prior structural MRI study TOF patient retrospective research . This three-dimensional method mathematically base nearly incompressible tissue deformation . The project propose validation technique , compare result current 'gold standard ' method presently use CMRI myocardial tag phase velocity mapping , pilot study clinical validation strain image TOF patient . The method track movement myocardial tissue throughout cardiac cycle compute strain associate normal clinical disease state . During study customize method software specific use CMRI TOF . We test method normal control TOF patient pre post pulmonary valve replacement .</detailed_description>
