	<brief_summary>Study Objectives : 1 . To document safe effective application F.T.M . Arm Training Program use SaeboFlex inpatient post stroke rehabilitation population . 2 . To compare functional improvement hand UE use achieve F.T.M . program compare generally apply therapeutic treatment approach . 3 . To develop recommendation inpatient retrain protocol could evaluate multi-center trial . 4 . To document retention UE hand improvement SaeboFlex training discontinue well carry gain daily function therapy discontinue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Investigating Feasibility Saebo Arm Training Program Inpatient Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic intervention recovery hand function neurological injury historically limit . A significant body research support use upper extremity retrain approach functional recovery neurological injury . Few therapeutic approach offer intervention specifically focus grasp release retrain . In effort address deficit , SaeboFlex dynamic hand orthosis develop occupational therapist . The F.T.M . Arm Training Program safely use hundred occupational physical therapist one thousand patient outpatient neurological rehabilitation past two year . It currently accept modality treatment management hand paresis acquire brain injury population . During time , two factor , severity initial injury , identify significant affect outcome achieve treatment . They learn non-use soft tissue shorten finger flexor . All treatment deliver subject partake study clinical care research component study assessment outcomes . The purpose study explore proper treatment dosage treatment protocol application F.T.M . Program inpatient post stroke rehabilitation population . Additionally , information functional outcome measure collect compare matched control group undergo standard therapeutic protocol .</detailed_description>
