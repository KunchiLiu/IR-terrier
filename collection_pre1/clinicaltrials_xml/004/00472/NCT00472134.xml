	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Ventral Hernia Repair With Elastomeric Pain Pump</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One outcome great 2 million abdominal operation perform United States year incisional hernia rate 3 % 20 % . As result , approximately 150,000 ventral hernia repair perform annually . The increase number incisional hernia merely reflect evolution surgery ability perform large abdominal operation aortic surgery colectomy . Primary tissue repair unacceptable rate recurrence use large defect . The introduction prosthetic biomaterials revolutionize hernia surgery concept tension-free repair . The subsequent rate recurrence lower less 10 % . However , require dissection wide area soft tissue mesh placement contribute incidence wind infection wound-related complication 12 % great . These problem part impetus develop minimally invasive technique ventral herniorrhaphy . The laparoscopic repair ventral hernia rapidly evolve patient surgeon interest less morbid herniorrhaphies appeal minimally invasive surgery . The technique base open , preperitoneal repair describe Rives Stoppa . The placement large mesh preperitoneal location allow even distribution force along surface area mesh , may account strength repair decrease recurrence rate associate . The minimally invasive approach embrace concept retromuscular mesh repair may durable , although mesh place one layer deep intact peritoneum comparison open technique . The technique incorporate fundamental component open repair wide mesh overlap defect use transabdominal fixation suture spiral tack secure mesh . While laparoscopic approach ventral hernia repair document safe effective , low recurrence rate minimal patient morbidity , patient complain significant post-operative pain 1-3 month surgery . The exact cause postoperative discomfort clearly elucidate . Several hypothesis exist . Some feel extensive adhesiolysis require incisional hernia repair cause significant peritoneal irritation exacerbate placement intraperitoneal mesh . Others implicate spiral tack place mesh peritoneum source persistent discomfort . While others feel transabdominal fixation suture localize site accompany postoperative pain . Transabdominal suture site pain laparoscopic ventral hernia repair uncommon , occur 23 % patient one series.8 The transabdominal fixation suture sit incision suture place secure mesh place laparoscopic ventral hernia repair anterior abdominal wall . The suture place `` clockwise '' manner approximately every 4 5 cm periphery mesh well 5 mm spiral tack hold place fibrocollagenous ingrowth secures mesh abdominal wall . This persistent abdominal pain document minor long-term complication result laparoscopic ventral hernia repair , troublesome patient immediate postoperative period . The effective method manage postoperative pain define . The goal postoperative care minimize amount pain patient experience follow surgery help patient make quick recovery lead short hospital stay free complication earlier return self-reliance . The common treatment pain operation opioid analgesic drug administration . Opioids associate undesirable side effect respiratory depression , nausea vomiting , itch , increased duration postoperative ileus , delay discharge . These side effect decrease reduction amount opioid drug utilize . Additionally , systemic narcotic may optimize pain management specific region body centralized effect . This may lead decreased mentation , reduce mobility , slow return normal activity . Because reduction daily consumption narcotic often associate decrease analgesia , many treatment postoperative pain evaluate . For example , epidural analgesia effective catheter need place preoperatively , fairly invasive method , maintenance epidural treatment time consume expensive . Many study find clinical pain management benefit use local analgesia , measure use less post-operative pain medication favorable rating pain intensity scale . Recently , new method deliver continuous wound infiltration solution local anesthetic indwelling irrigation apparatus use attempt reduce early postoperative discomfort patient thoracotomy , donor nephrectomy , open inguinal hernia repair . These prospective randomized double blind study universally report decrease postoperative discomfort limit usage opioids usage novel catheter . In study , goal minimize postoperative pain post-operative narcotic requirement unnecessary require less frequently . The infusion local anesthetic immediately follow surgical procedure intend allow body tissue react favorably surgical stress reduce early postoperative pain . The primary hypothesis continuous infusion local anesthetic along edge mesh near transabdominal fixation suture spiral tack place secure mesh anterior abdominal wall subjectively objectively improve postoperative pain control follow laparoscopic ventral hernia repair . A secondary hypothesis pulmonary function bowel function postoperatively recover fast use continuous infusion local anesthetic .</detailed_description>
