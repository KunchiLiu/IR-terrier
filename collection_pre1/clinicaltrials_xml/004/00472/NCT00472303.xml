	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether tapentadol ( CG5503 ) effective safe treatment chronic tumor relate pain compare placebo . In addition tapentadol ( CG5503 ) also compare morphine control release , also refer slow release ( SR ) . *Tapentadol prolonged-release ( PR ) term use European Union refer extended release ( ER ) United States .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) Treatment Chronic Tumor-Related Pain Compared With Placebo Morphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Normally chronic tumor relate pain controlled participant receive repeat dos opioid analgesic . However , opioid therapy commonly associate side effect nausea , vomit , sedation , constipation , addiction , tolerance , respiratory depression . Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) , newly synthesize drug prolong release ( PR ) formulation , also act centrally act pain reliever 2 mechanisms action . The aim trial investigate effectiveness ( level pain control ) safety ( side effect ) tapentadol ( CG5503 ) PR compare drug ( placebo ) correspond dose morphine ( opioid commonly use treat tumor relate pain ) . This trial randomize , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment receive ) , active- placebo-controlled , parallel-group , randomized withdrawal design , multicenter trial . The trial include 2 week titration phase start either 40 mg morphine ( PR ) bid ( bid = twice daily dose , one dose morning one dose even ) 100 mg tapentadol ( CG5503 ) PR bid . Based effectiveness side effect subject up-titrate step 50 mg tapentadol ( CG5503 PR ) maximal dose 250 mg tapentadol ( CG5503 ) PR bid 100 mg morphine PR bid . If participant meet stabilisation criterion end titration phase re-randomized either placebo active treatment continue 4 week last dose level maintenance phase . Only participants tapentadol titration phase re-randomized either matching placebo tapentadol . To maintain blinding nature trial participant morphine arm titration phase also re-randomized however remain morphine control release maintenance phase . Placebo match tapentadol tablet , well placebo match morphine capsule , use mask treatment allocation . Participants issue electronic diary ( eDiary ) capture Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) pain intensity . Assessments pain relief include pain intensity numeric rating scale ( NRS ) patient global impression change ( PGIC ) . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test electrocardiograms . Venous blood sample collect determination serum concentration tapentadol ( CG5503 ) .</detailed_description>
