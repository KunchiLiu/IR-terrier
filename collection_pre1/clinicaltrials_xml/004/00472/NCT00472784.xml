	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE : 1 . To study tissue spinal cord injure patient noncompliant bladder well neurologically intact patient normal bladder compliance , analyze quantitative qualitative neural efferent receptor , collagen , smooth muscle content , use RT-PCR electron microscopy . 2 . To explore possible shift bladder neural architecture SCI beta alpha-adrenergic receptor . RESEARCH DESIGN : 25 spinal cord injury patient underwent cystoscopic procedure include study . 25 control patient without spinal cord injury already schedule urologic procedure also include study . METHODOLOGY : Study patient undergo flexible rigid cystoscopy well selective cold cup biopsy posterior lateral wall , trigonal area bladder . Control patent undergo cystoscopy select bladder biopsy precede schedule urologic procedure . Tissue sample freeze later EM RT-PCR analysis collagen , smooth muscle , efferent adrenergic receptor content subtype . Hemostasis achieve cautery electrode . Criteria exclusion include active urinary tract infection identify preoperative urinalysis , presence suspicious lesion see cystoscopy . Suspicious area biopsied patient exclude study . Subjects give preoperative dose Rocephin 1g IM well postoperative 3-day course Cipro 500 mg BID . Control patient give standard perioperative prophylactic/empiric therapy indicate urologic procedure . Patients follow 1-2 week evaluate postoperative course . FINDINGS : Total number subject enrol : 43 . 12-03 : To date encounter problem study health wise subject do fine . No adverse event report . Preliminary Results : The tissue currently analyze - mRNA microchip analysis data still work look correlation gene regulation versus morphological EM finding previously report .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty-five ( 25 ) spinal cord injury patient , part annual cystoscopic screen squamous cell carcinoma , include study . Approximately twenty-five ( 25 ) control patient without spinal cord injury already schedule cystoscopic procedure ( transurethral resection prostate TURP benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH , transurethral resection low-grade superficial bladder tumor TURBT , lithotripsy urinary stone ) include study . Enrollment additional patient necessary increase statistical power demonstrate significant difference study control group . Preliminary result reveal electron microscopy accurate differentiate neurogenic detrusor muscle normal . There strong trend towards increase type I/type III collagen expression SCI patient versus normal , recruitment patient necessary demonstrate unequivocally statistical difference . Patients undergo flexible rigid cystoscopy well selective cold cup biopsy posterior lateral wall , trigonal area bladder . Bladder mapping ( diagram attach ) perform document specific area biopsied . Tissue sample freeze later RT-PCR analysis collagen , smooth muscle , efferent adrenergic receptor content subtype . No anesthesia require SCI study patient . Control group patient undergo anesthesia indicate TURP cystoscopic procedure . Hemostasis achieve cautery electrode . Criteria exclusion include active urinary tract infection identify preoperative urinalysis . Patients low-grade superficial bladder tumor , classic cystoscopic appearance , longer exclude study since direct cold cup bladder biopsy sit away visible tumor ( obtain posterior , lateral wall , well trigone bladder ) consider standard care rule occult carcinoma-in-situ ( CIS ) . Prophylactic perioperative antibiotic employ . Patients follow 1-2 week evaluate postoperative course . Annual cystoscopy spinal cord injure patient screen squamous cell carcinoma well preoperative cystoscopy TURP , TURBT , lithotripsy candidate consider standard clinical care . Selective bladder biopsy normal appear bladder mucosa muscle include part study protocol . Study patient give preoperative dose Rocephin 1 gm IM well postoperative 3-day course Cipro 500mg BD . Control patient give standard perioperative prophylactic/empiric therapy indicate schedule cystoscopic procedure . Study patient schedule two visit . The first visit part annual exam , include cystoscopy , bladder biopsy , last approximately one hour . The second visit , two week later , examine patient 's postoperative course . This visit last approximately 15 minute . Control patient undergo cystoscopy select bladder biopsy precede already schedule cystoscopic surgery .</detailed_description>
