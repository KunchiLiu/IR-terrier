	<brief_summary>The toxicity calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) major factor limit success renal transplantation . This protocol aim replace calcineurin inhibitor , tacrolimus , efalizumab early transplantation patient mild impairment renal function order minimize toxicity CNI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Conversion From Tacrolimus Efalizumab Maintenance Therapy Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last two decade significant improvement renal transplantation due large part decrease incidence acute rejection ( le 20 % first renal transplant ) use calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) cyclosporin tacrolimus . Though proven effective anti-rejection medication use associated adverse side effect , include high blood pressure , post transplant diabetes , high cholesterol , predispose risk factor cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease . Chronic use drug also wag limitation long term survival transplant kidney kidney recipient increase development chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) . There also increase incidence chronic renal failure non renal transplant recipient receive CNI base treatment . The mechanism action reagent know imprecise science seek replace current therapy place less toxic drug specific signal pathway target . In recent year cell surface protein , restrict cell immune system identify mediator rejection response . The activation T cell see activate immune response correlate clinically rejection . Integrins , specifically leukocyte function associate antigen LFA-1 , cell surface molecule play role T-cell activation . LFA-1 make two subunit , know CD11 CD18 . Efalizumab humanize monoclonal antibody CD11 molecule . By bind CD11 T cell system block interaction LFA-1 ICAM-1 , intercellular adhesion molecule also necessary T cell activation , thereby diminish immune response . The blockade form deplete T cell . There preliminary study use efalizumab combination cyclosporine . A low incidence rejection observe group receive efalizumab ( 7.8 % ) . However 3 case post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease see 38 patient . There case lymphomas lymphoproliferative disease report clinical trial evaluate efalizumab treatment psoriasis , suggest combination efalizumab cyclosporine may result immunosuppression . As per standard care , recipient kidney transplant Emory manage combination calcineurin inhibitor Prograf ( tacrolimus ) , Cellcept ( antiproliferative agent ) Prednisone , corticosteroid . For study investigator choose substitute efalizumab place Prograf , 3 month post transplant period incidence acute rejection high . Efalizumab , know trade name Raptiva , approve FDA October 2003 treatment psoriasis . It hypothesize conversion Prograf efalizumab associate improved renal function associate increase risk rejection . The investigator hope address challenge face recipient transplant kidney long course transplant organ 's management favorable alternative .</detailed_description>
