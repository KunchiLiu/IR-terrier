	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety immune response experimental DNA HIV vaccine follow boost either experimental adenoviral vector HIV vaccine serotype 5 35 HIV uninfected adult . This study also determine safety immune response adenoviral vector HIV vaccine serotype 5 follow booster adenoviral vector serotype 35 , vice versa , HIV uninfected adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response DNA HIV Vaccine Followed By Boosting With One Two Serotypes Adenoviral Vector HIV Vaccine Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may control development utilization safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection . Vaccines use DNA plasmid prime response adenoviral vector boost currently develop . Due high prevalence pre-existing immunity adenovirus serotype Ad5 develop world , study evaluate boost different serotype , Ad35 , compare boost Ad5 serotype . This study also test effect order administration recombinant adenoviral vector HIV vaccine administer without DNA plasmid vaccine . Two arm study evaluate safety immunogenicity experimental multiclade , multigene HIV DNA vaccine VRC-HIVDNA044-00-VP , follow similarly structure adenovirus vector vaccine boost ( either VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP ) , HIV uninfected adult . To determine effect pre-existing Ad5 Ad35 immunity , two arm test safety immunogenicity receive either VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP follow VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP , vice versa . Each volunteer participate study least 6 month . Participants randomly assign one four group receive either experimental vaccine placebo vaccination visit . Group 1 participant receive injection adenoviral vector vaccine VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP study entry injection VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP Month 3 . Group 2 participant receive injection adenoviral vector vaccine VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP study entry injection VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP Month 3 . Group 3 participant receive injection VRC-HIVDNA044-00-VP vaccine study entry Months 1 2 , follow injection VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP Month 6 . Group 4 participant receive injection DNA HIV vaccine study entry Months 1 2 , follow injection VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP Month 6 . For Groups 1 2 , 9 study visit . For Groups 3 4 , 13 study visit . Medication history , assessment intercurrent illness adverse effect , HIV pregnancy prevention counsel occur visit . A medical history , physical exam , HIV test counsel blood urine collection occur select visit . Participants also ask complete social impact HIV test history questionnaire select visit . As 11/19/07 enrollment vaccination discontinue . Participants already enrol told vaccination receive followed total 5 year .</detailed_description>
