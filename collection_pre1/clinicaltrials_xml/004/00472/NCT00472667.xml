	<detailed_description>Clinical laboratory sign neither specific sensitive diagnosis sepsis critically-ill patient . Because delay antimicrobial therapy may deleterious , broad-spectrum antibiotic widely use ICU -patients , even need . In addition , well-designed study concern duration antibiotic treatment far publish . Consequently , many patient receive antibiotic ICU stay . Many study show exposure antibiotic , call `` selection pressure '' independent risk factor acquisition resistance individual patient . Therefore , reduce antibiotic use probably necessary control antibiotic resistance . Many clinical study show procalcitonin ( PCT ) able distinguish inflammatory response infection type inflammation distinguish bacterial viral infection . Recent study show PCT guidance substantially safely reduce antibiotic overuse patient low respiratory tract infection . We aim evaluate role PCT reduce use antibiotic ICU adult patient . The study prospective , randomize , control intervention trial conduct 9 center , compare conventional strategy versus PCT-guided strategy start discontinue antibiotic , patient suspect community hospital- acquire infection .</detailed_description>
