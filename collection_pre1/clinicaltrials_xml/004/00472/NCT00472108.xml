	<brief_summary>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) selective destruction abnormal cell light activation photosensitiser presence oxygen . These cell accumulate photosensitiser normal cell . The photosensitiser generate reactive oxygen specie upon illumination . For skin disease , increase interest use precursor endogenous photosensitiser protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) . The commonly used precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) derivative . The present test drug , Metvix , contain methyl ester ALA , penetrate lesion well show high lesion selectivity . In vitro study animal human tissue show significant intracellular formation photoactive porphyrin addition Metvix . The increased photoactive porphyrin level induce cytotoxic effect tumour cell photoactivation . The primary objective compare PDT Metvix cream PDT placebo cream term patient complete response rate base histologically verified disappearance lesion 6 month last treatment cycle . Secondary objective compare two treatment term histological clinical mean patient response weight number lesion within patient , lesion response rate across patient , clinical complete patient response , cosmetic outcome adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) With Metvix Cream 160 mg/g Versus PDT With Placebo Cream Patients With Primary Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A patient randomise PDT Metvix cream PDT placebo cream . All eligible BCC lesion within patient get treatment . All patient get two consecutive treatment one week apart . At 3-months follow-up visit , lesion clinical response progression surgically excise . Lesions partial response ( 50 % great reduction lesion area ) re-treated ; show complete response three month later , surgically excise . Lesions complete response surgically excise 6 month first second PDT cycle . All excise tissue specimen histologically examine .</detailed_description>
