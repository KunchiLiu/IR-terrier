	<brief_title>Do Sulphonylureas Preserve Cortical Function During Hypoglycaemia ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low blood glucose ( hypoglycaemia ) common important side effect insulin treatment diabetes . Most episodes “ mild ” lead symptom alert individual raise blood sugar level consume sugar starch ( carbohydrate ) . The body also respond low blood sugar produce hormone adrenaline cortisol , help restore blood sugar level normal . As brain relies sugar fuel , function properly blood sugar level drop low , result confusion extreme case reduce conscious level . Repeated hypoglycaemia blunt protective symptom hormonal response hypoglycaemia limit patient ’ ability recognise correct hypoglycaemia , put high risk even hypoglycaemia ( Heller Cryer , 1991 ) . Sulphonylureas tablet use treat type 2 diabetes work stimulate pancreas make insulin . They close pore call KATP channel find surface many cell control rate fire cell . In pancreas , close cause cell fire release insulin . However , tissue brain , channel protective function open time lack fuel , lack oxygen sugar , prevent cell fire put rest mode reduces energy requirement ( Dunn-Meynell , Rawson Levin 1998 ) . However , brain cell responsible generate symptom put rest mode , may produce symptom , may contribute hypoglycaemia unawareness .</detailed_description>
