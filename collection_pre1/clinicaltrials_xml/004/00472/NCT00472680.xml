	<brief_title>The Effect Severe Weight Loss Protein Intake Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It unclear whether amount protein diet caloric restriction influence bone density . This information important determine optimal nutrient requirement weight loss . This study examine usual high dietary protein intake severe weight loss follow weight loss surgery bone turnover , mass quality woman , hypothesis high protein intake reduce bone turnover loss , and/or prevent change bone quality associate severe weight loss woman age 18 70 year . Participants randomly assign one 2 group : A ) weight loss recommend level protein intake , B ) weight loss high protein intake . A dietitian provide instruction reduce calorie , well balance diet throughout 12-month study use nutrition-education behavior- modification program . Participants opportunity speak dietitian diet phone , on-site twice per month . In addition ask take daily vitamin/mineral supplement , depend usual food intake , may ask take calcium tablet meet recommend intake throughout study period . Bone , mineral , protein lipid marker , hormone influence bone measure . These measurement provide information body composition ( fat , muscle mass , bone mineral density ) .</detailed_description>
