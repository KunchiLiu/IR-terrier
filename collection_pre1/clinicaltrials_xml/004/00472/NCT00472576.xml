	<brief_summary>Purpose : This study determine whether MK-0657 , selective NR2B Antagonist , quickly improve symptom depressed mood , psychomotor retardation , poor motivation reduce enjoyment thing patient major depression . MK-0657 decrease activity brain receptor call NMDA , chemical glutamate bind , possibly induce rapid antidepressant response . People 18 55 year age major depression least 4 week ' duration help two antidepressant approve major depression may eligible study . Women able child exclude . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center two study phase , follow . Phase I ( 1 2 week ) : Patients taper current medication . Phase II ( 7 week ) : Patients randomly assign take either MK-0657 placebo ( look-alike capsule active ingredient ) mouth 12 day . At point second part phase , patient take MK-0657 switch placebo take placebo switch MK-0657 . Participants undergo follow procedure study : Physical examination twice ( begin end study ) Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) four time Blood test six time Rating scale 28 time assess effect MK-0657 mood think Blood pressure measurement three time day . Study examine effectiveness new medication , target system call glutamate , improve depression compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Even though many antidepressant drug clinical use , clinical trial indicate 30 % 40 % patient major depression fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Furthermore , medication may take week month achieve full effect meantime , patient continue suffer symptom risk self-harm well harm personal professional life . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic treatment-resistant major depression rapid onset action . Recent preclinical study suggest antidepressant may exert delayed indirect effect glutamatergic system , specifically NMDA receptor complex . A recent study group find single intravenous dose non-competitive NMDA antagonist ketamine produce rapid , robust relatively sustained antidepressant effect patient treatment-resistant major depression . Together , data suggest NMDA receptor may play important role mechanism antidepressant action . Unfortunately , ketamine 's psychotomimetic effect preclude use chronic antidepressant ; side effect probably result ketamine 's effect multiple NMDA subunit . Thus , study selective NMDA subunit antagonists depression reasonable next step . The NR2B subunit stand prime candidate test depression . Preclinical data group indicate NR2B subunit involve mechanism antidepressant action indicate change phosphorylation serine residue learn helplessness model depression chronic treatment imipramine . In addition , find NR2B antagonist R0 25-6981 antidepressant-like property force swim test . We propose examine whether selective NR2B antagonist ( MK-0657 ) produce rapid antidepressant effect patient treatment-resistant major depression without cause psychotomimetic effect . Male female patient , age 18 55 year , diagnosis major depression ( without psychotic feature ) , recruit study . This study consist double-blind crossover administration either NR2B antagonist MK-0657 ( 4-8 mg/day ) placebo . The specific aim study assess efficacy 12 day selective NR2B antagonist ( MK-0657 , 4-8 mg/day give orally ) compare placebo improve overall depressive symptomatology patient treatment-resistant major depression . Our primary hypothesis subject treatment-resistant major depression randomize selective NR2B antagonist ( MK-0657 ) rapid superior response compare randomized placebo . This proof concept treatment study . Approximately , 27 subject randomize ; accrual ceiling protocol 60 subject .</detailed_description>
