	<detailed_description>UCDs group rare genetic disease affect protein break body . The cause UCDs deficiency one eight enzyme responsible remove ammonia , waste product protein metabolism , bloodstream . Normally , ammonia convert urea remove body form urine . However , people UCDs , ammonia accumulates unchecked remove body . Toxic level ammonia build cause irreversible neurologic damage affect metabolism , cognition , sensation , movement . This study focus common enzyme disorder among UCDs , ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ( OTCD ) , disorder inherit mother . Using different type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , study evaluate UCD-related neurologic injury affect metabolism , cognition , sensation , movement adult OTCD . Participants study attend initial study visit include review medical history , current symptom , impairment , diet history ; urine blood collection ; physical exam ; full neurological exam ; cognitive motor test . During visit , participant undergo image study additional cognitive motor test 2- 3-day period . This include standard MRI study four session consist functional MRI ( fMRI ) , diffusion tensor imaging , 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy . For fMRI study , participant perform various motor behavioral task image scanner . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) use study evaluate chemical makeup specific brain area . Diffusion tensor image use ass myelination major brain pathway alteration disease state . This study involve one-time participation . There follow-up visit study .</detailed_description>
