	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Training Integrated OPUS Treatment Versus OPUS Treatment-as-usual</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurocognition competence schizophrenia A randomize control trial cognitive training ( CT ) integrate OPUS treatment versus OPUS treatment-as-usual The presence cognitive deficit schizophrenia It well-established fact cognitive deficit play major role functional outcome schizophrenia ( Keefe et al , 2006 ; Gold , 2004 ) . Up 85 % patient demonstrate cognitive dysfunction range 1½-2 SD norm ( Fagerlund , 2004 ; Corrigan &amp; Penn , 2001 ; Heinrichs &amp; Zankanis , 1998 ) . Cognitive dysfunction associate schizophrenia involve attention , information processing , memory , executive function lead difficulty learn poor problem solve ability . Evidence effect rehabilitation everyday competency In spite severely debilitate cognitive dysfunction , relatively large number patient show capable acquire new ability ( e.g . Kern et al , 2005 ; Sartory et al , 2005 ; Ueland &amp; Rund , 2004 ; Krabbendam &amp; Aleman , 2003 , Pilling et al , 2002 , Harvey &amp; Sharma , 2001 ; Tsang &amp; Pearson , 2001 , Danion et al , 2001 , Bell et al , 2003 , Wykes et al , 1999 , 2003 ) . Research show train symptom handling , social proficiency training , supportive provision occupational relation apparently help patient schizophrenia function daily life , learn solve concrete practical social task , manage relatively independently . These improvement enhance self-esteem . Effect study cognitive rehabilitation A Cochrane review do Hayes &amp; McGrath ( 2000 ) include three small randomize controlled trial fails provide conclusive data evidence cognitive training treatment schizophrenia . Krabbendam &amp; Aleman 's review ( 2003 ) 12 controlled study find weighted mean effect size ( Cohen 's ) 0.45 95 % CI , 0.26-0.64 ) , indicate small moderate effect cognitive training ( CT ) patient schizophrenia . In Twamley et al . 's review ( 2003 ) 17 randomise , control study CT , weight mean effect size calculate across study . The weighted mean effect size ( Cohen 's ) 0.32 improvement cognitive performance , 0.26 reduction symptom severity , 0.51 domain everyday functioning . The review author recommend longitudinal design well inclusion real-life outcome measure future trial . Many study CT underpowered ( small sample size ) , limit conclusion draw result improvement ( Ueland &amp; Rund , 2005 ) . The variability outcome measure use also complicate interpretation finding , thus , consensus battery ( MATRICS ) outcome measure suggest future study . Silverstein &amp; Wilkniss ( 2004 ) Bellack ( 2004 ) note result cognitive rehabilitation generally fail secure ecological validity , wherefore CT ought integrate broader psychosocial programme intervention schizophrenia . Other shortcoming earlier study include short-term programme lack sufficient long-sighted follow-up examination well experimental design lack consideration individual ability involvement . A recent review cognitive rehabilitation ( Velligan et al , 2006 ) underscore importance address motivation primary target . Hogarty et al 's ( 2004 ) promise result randomise , control trial ( N=121 ) computer-assisted CT also highlight importance examine extent control condition ( psychosocial treatment ) improve cognitive functioning . Broadly view , sufficient evidence combination CT psychosocial treatment , rather individually appear initiative , great potential promoting treatment outcome ( Bell et al , 2003 ) . There need well-organised sufficiently large randomise clinical trial effect integrate CT psychosocial rehabilitation . In order examine extent CT improve psychosocial rehabilitation facilitate new learning , one must identify compare improvement level neuropsychological performance well level everyday competency ( Reeder et al , 2006 ; Buchanan et al , 2005 ; McKibbin et al , 2004 ) . The present trial employ prospective design 16 week follow follow-up 10 month inclusion , seek CT secure individual adaptation motivation trough continuous evaluation level adjustment patient trainer . Objectives 1 . Primary hypothesis The effect 16-weeks programme computer-based CT integrate OPUS treatment patient ' competency daily life superior standard OPUS treatment . Primary response variable : Total score UPSA-B ( Patterson et al , 2001 Danish version ) . 2 . Secondary hypothesis The effect 16-weeks programme CT integrate OPUS treatment patient ' cognitive functioning superior standard OPUS treatment . Response variable : Scores MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB ) , Trailmaking B WCST-64 ( computerized version ) . 3 . Tertiary hypothesis The effect 16-weeks programme computer-based CT integrate OPUS treatment superior standard OPUS treatment term patient ' association labour market , general health self-esteem . Response variable : Occupational status general functioning measure Rosenberg 's Self-Esteem Scale ( Rosenberg , 1989 ) . Furthermore , want examine association first episode patient ' cognitive function level competency daily life , divide primary secondary objective : Blinding The instructor CT make call participant ' data CTU thereafter inform patient intervention programme allocate . The study blind regard patient , cognitive trainer therapist . The blinding apply raters engage outcome evaluation . In follow-up patient instruct advance reveal type treatment receive . By register type intervention independent assessor outcome believe patient receiving evaluate blinding succeed . The randomised intervention allocation conceal statistical analysis result data complete . Participants Patients recruit OPUS implemented standard treatment programme young adult firstepisode psychosis Copenhagen Århus . The staff OPUS recruit patient project . The independent assessor interview refer patient evaluate follow in- exclusion criterion . Inclusion criteria 1 ) 18 35 year age , 2 ) first episode psychosis within F2 spectrum schizotypal disorder ICD 10 - post-acute phase illness , 3 ) sufficient comprehension Danish , 4 ) write informed consent . Exclusion criteria 1 ) rejection participation , 2 ) organic disorder , 3 ) noticeable misuse psychoactive drug Control intervention group All patient receive treatment usually provide OPUS . Standard treatment OPUS consist affiliation primary contact person , involvement family , possibility psychoeducation social skill train describe detail http : //www.psykiatri.aaa.dk/cent_enh/opus.htm www.opus-kbh.dk . Depending individual need patient offer take part group therapy either social skill train ( SST ) cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . Participation SST CBT might beneficial cognition everyday skill . To ensure comparability patient allocate experimental intervention ( CT ) patient allocate standard OPUS treatment , stratify patient accord group therapy ( SST/CBT ) yes/no . Patients randomize control group receive treatment usual described . Experimental intervention A pilot study OPUS Århus lead completion manual 16-week CT programme patient schizophrenia ( Christensen &amp; Olsen , 2006 ) . One hour twice week 16 week patient engage computer-assisted CT plus one competence dialog every week . Training consist four module : first three module cover area attention , memory executive function , last module focus cognitive area relate task individual patient need prefer work : Thus , content module 4 base patient 's trainer 's judgement . Training contain exercise simple attention , attention span vigilance , planning , problem solving , stimulus-bind perseveration tendency , interaction-based training work memory , verbal visual long-term memory . The CT approach orient towards teach compensatory strategy , simple repetition non-social cognitive task gradually increase level difficulty also part CT program . By 90 % correct task-completion , level increase . Module 1 2 base computertasks ( COGNIsoft ) , whereas follow module 3 4 include practical everyday task . In review Twamley , Jeste Bellack ( 2003 ) stress importance directly target everyday functioning patient . Thus , calendartraining vital part intervention : way address common difficulty memory planning ability . Calendartraining competence dialogue support environmental adaptation transference learning . Training relies errorless learn principle , scaffold , repetition , strategy-learning recommend Wykes &amp; van der Gaag ( 1999 ) . Positive reinforcement , modelling , verbal instruction widely use . Trainers describe structure explain purpose training exercise begin every session provide consistent learning environment . Assessments All assessment except Present State Examination-interview ( PSE , clinical version ) premorbid IQ ( DART : Danish version National Adult Reading Test , Nelson , 1991 ) conduct baseline , 4 month 10 month inclusion , irrespective whether patient follow full training programme ( intention-to-treat principle ) . - Positive negative symptom evaluate Positive Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS ) . - Assessment health occupational general function . - Neuropsychological test functional level 7 cognitive domain . According NIMH-initiative MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery ( MCCB , Nuechterlein et al , 2004 ) include seven separate cognitive area .
