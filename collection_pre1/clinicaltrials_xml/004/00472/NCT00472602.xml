	<detailed_description>Liver fluke infection cause Opisthorchis viverrini ( OV ) major public health problem part East Asia . In Thailand , estimate 6 million people infected OV . Experimental epidemiological evidence strongly implicate OV infection etiology cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) . Studies show 10-20 % OV-infected person advance periportal fibrosis ( HBA ) progress CCA . OV infection may cause inflammation bile duct result DNA damage epithelium subsequent malignant transformation . The primary objective study determine in-vitro level inflammatory cytokine induce crude antigen extract OV associate hepatobiliary abnormality know progress CCA OV-infected adult age 20 60 year age . The secondary objective determine in-vitro level inflammatory cytokine induce crude antigen extract OV adult hepatobiliary abnormality change 12 month treatment praziquantel change associate persistent advanced fibrosis ( grade 2 3 ) determine ultrasonography . The primary outcome measure elevate level inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-alpha ) induce OV infection associate 50 % great risk ( OR = 1.50 ) advance fibrosis ( grade 2 3 ) determine ultrasonography . The secondary outcome measure elevate level inflammatory cytokine 12 month treatment OV infection associate 50 % great risk ( OR = 1.50 ) maintaining advanced fibrosis know progress CCA time period . District health outpost report great equal 20 percent prevalence OV infection among adult identify , whereupon male female , 20 60 year age , screen OV infection . Study sit Thailand district Ban Pai , Chonnabot , Muncha Khiri Kok Pochai , region along drainage Chi River , vicinity regional capitol , Khon Kaen city . A recruitment ceiling 20,000 individual establish screen infection OV , 6,000 enrol observational longitudinal part study . OV-infected individual receive ultrasound examination grade either HBA positive ( advanced fibrosis ) HBA negative ( non-advanced fibrosis ) . Over 24 month period , 1,116 OV-infected individual HBA positive recruit . The first 484 OV-infected individual HBA age sex match OV-infected individual region HBA negative . Blood sample draw volunteer use immunological evaluation OV infection relation HBA status . This constitute observation stage study . The 1,116 OV-infected individual HBA follow additional 12 month , ultrasound exam blood draw . This constitute longitudinal stage study . All volunteer treat OV infection praziquantel .</detailed_description>
