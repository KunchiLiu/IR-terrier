	<brief_summary>Patients immunosuppressive therapy , e.g . organ recipient , high occurrence AK untreated population . Keratotic lesion ( i.e . AK lesion wart ) population highly associate development SCC also 10 time high mortality rate SCC expect . The risk develop skin cancer , predominantly SCC BCC , increase graft survival time length immunosuppressive treatment period . The high risk develop skin malignancy aggressive skin malignancy population , indicate need early removal pre-malignant lesion . In study , two contralateral area ( 5x10 cm2 ) skin lesion within patient compare . One area receive Metvix PDT define interval receive lesion specific treatment discretion investigator . The primary end-point accumulate number new lesion study number AK lesion show complete response 3 month baseline . Secondary endpoint number BCC lesion show complete response , number recurrent lesion , assessment cosmetic outcome safety .</brief_summary>
