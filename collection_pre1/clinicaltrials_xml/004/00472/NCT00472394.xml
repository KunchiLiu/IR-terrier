	<brief_title>Determining Women 's Preferences Medical Abortion Using Willingness Pay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FDA-approved regimen medical abortion specifies treatment oral mifepristone follow 48 hour later oral misoprostol . Women 's experience regimen assess early medical abortion trial precede FDA approval . The majority woman use regimen rat experience satisfactory satisfactory abortion complete ( Newhall 2000 ) . A weakness data collect woman likely priori preference medical abortion demonstrate participation experimental study method . Other factor affect woman 's preference little medical abortion per se ability avoid involvement insurance company participate study method offer free charge ( Clark S , et al . 2000 ) . Since time study perform , multiple investigation evaluate alternative regimen use mifepristone misoprostol medical abortion ( Creinin MD , 2000 ) . Improving efficacy , reduce side effect , increase flexibility time route medication administration driven development alternative regimen ( Newhall EP Winikoff B , 2000 ) . As early study , trial new regimen assess acceptability satisfaction post-treatment . In general , overall satisfaction report high regardless regimen ( Ho PC , 2006 ) . However , ask specific aspect medical abortion treatment , woman 's preference appear nuanced . Route misoprostol administration one example . Shannon , et al . ( 2006 ) compare mifepristone oral vaginal misoprostol find overall acceptability 91 % , regardless route administration . However , specifically ask preference route , odds prefer oral administration greatly exceed odds prefer vaginal ( OR = 13.7 , 95 % CI 6.5-28.7 ) . A preference oral administration also demonstrate comparative trial Schaff , et al . ( 2001 ) , however preference driven great amount pain experience vaginal group . Further insight complexity acceptability satisfaction specific regimen provide pilot study I perform mifepristone buccal misoprostol ( 4 tablet misoprostol dissolve cheek gum 30 minute ) . Detailed information regard acceptability , like , dislike collect pre- post-treatment . As study , 91 % woman survey would choose medical abortion . However , 42 % find experience positive one . When ask specifically buccal route administration , 72 % disliked aspect use misoprostol way . Of note , pre-treatment , half woman would prefer oral administration 13 % buccal . Post-treatment , woman ask route would prefer assume equal efficacy . The majority ( 70 % ) list oral whereas preference buccal drop 9 % . Most woman cite dissatisfaction experience use misoprostol buccally either inconvenient , taste bad , chalky aftertaste . Questions preference usually include assumption factor specific attribute examine equal , may may case . Careful examination specific regimen present part comprehensive scenario join use targeted question may provide insight lack understanding preference . It still unclear , example , decrement efficacy , subsequent need surgical procedure , combination degree expect side effect expect amount pain , route timing administration , woman would find acceptable thus would determine preference option available . The purpose study ascertain woman 's preference different aspect medical abortion treatment . In addition question directly assess preference , economic instrument willingness pay ( WTP ) employ . The technique WTP base premise maximum amount money individual willing pay attribute treatment indicator utility satisfaction attribute ( Donaldson C , 1993 ) . This method use successfully measuring strength preference medical surgical abortion ( Gibb S , et al . 1998 ) , miscarriage management ( Ryan Hughes , 1997 ) , model antenatal care ( Ryan M , et al. , 1997 ) . As opposed `` strength preference '' measure use scale quality adjust life year , involve time trade-off achieve improvement state , WTP value health option place monetary value option ( Gibb , 1998 ) . The maximum WTP take indication preference strength one option another relative WTP value meaningfully compare assume like unit measurement , example oral versus vaginal misoprostol administration . The propose survey address characteristic FDA approved-regimen alternative regimen design studied thus far . The variable include mode misoprostol administration ( oral , buccal , vaginal , sublingual ) , time lapse mifepristone misoprostol administration , medication take ( home compare physician 's office ) , side effect , pain , efficacy . We attempt inclusive possible regard modifiable attribute medical abortion treatment route time medication administration . The survey divide three section . The first section utilize WTP methodology scenario side effect comparison different medical abortion regimen , include single overall comparison medical surgical abortion . With regard medical regimen , FDA-approved regimen , buccal , sublingual , oral alternative regimen compare vaginal regimen commonly use United States today . The value use regimen 's side effect , pain , efficacy profile base gestational age appropriate result clinical trial . For example , FDA-approved regimen use seven week gestation . It , therefore , compare vaginal regimen performs seven week . Similarly , buccal alternative study randomize controlled trial vaginal regimen though eight week gestation . The second section survey ask woman rank rate individual characteristic medical abortion treatment present scenario . The ranking rating question serve two purpose , 1 ) convergent validity determine compare dollar amount give WTP question ( implicit ranking ) compare explicit ranking rating give question 2 ) address individual variable encompass within WTP scenario attempt tease preference certain aspect medical abortion regimen compare aspect might determine preference . The third section collect demographic data , include income level , well pregnancy previous abortion history . New medical abortion regimen test increase frequency ; however woman 's experience regimens explored great degree . Consideration woman 's preference design new regimen may help optimize medical abortion process . This prospective evaluation attempt determine aspects medical abortion treatment woman value , thus prefer , . The information collect study may use guide develop future treatment regimens clinical protocol . Design methodology Women , 18 year age old , present Center Family Planning Research ( CFPR ) Magee-Womens Hospital desire medical abortion invite participate study . The anticipated sample size approximately 200 . The attached survey ( see Attachment 1 ) give subject willing participate study prior screen procedure abortion . All subject introduce survey content , intent , method face-to-face discussion research assistant . The subject give time complete survey independently . Research assistants available technical guidance answer technical question need . Subjects complete one-time survey anonymously . After survey complete subject screen abortion perform . Data analysis Collected data questionnaire compile descriptive statistic generate . Maximum willingness pay ( WTP ) value estimate use mean median . Association difference comparison categorical value make use Chi-square Fisher 's exact test appropriate continuous value use Student 's t-test . Univariable multivariable regression analysis perform determine predictor preference base WTP . Finally , preference demographic data use create regression model evaluate , , discrete factor drive woman 's preference . This model also use adjust WTP value take indication willingness pay ability pay . Number subject statistical power The study population non-probability base convenience sample woman present CFPR medical abortion October , 2006-April , 2007 . It estimate approximately 200 woman able complete survey time . The number estimate base currently ongoing medical abortion trial , include 175 woman , well woman undergo non-trial related medical abortion office . All woman present Center medical abortion inform survey anticipate willing participate . It unclear proportion subject prefer medical abortion attribute . Using conservative proportional estimate .5 , probability sample size 200 give 90 % confidence level margin error 6 % .</detailed_description>
