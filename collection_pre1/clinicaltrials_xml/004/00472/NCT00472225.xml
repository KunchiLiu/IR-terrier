	<brief_summary>Chronic GVHD common late complication follow allogeneic stem cell transplantation . It feature resemble autoimmune disorder scleroderma , primary biliary cirrhosis , bronchiolitis obliterans , chronic immunodeficiency etc . Thus , chronic GVHD lead debilitate complication joint contracture , blindness , end-stage lung disease , etc chronic GVHD major impact survival well quality life . Although pathogenesis still poorly unclear , report since 2000 B cell-mediated immunity may also contribute development chronic GVHD T cell . Thus , target B cell may useful treatment strategy treatment chronic GVHD . The purpose study determine whether rituximab , anti-CD20 monoclonal kimeric antibody effective treatment chronic graft-versus-host disease ( chronic GVHD ) refractory steroid .</brief_summary>
