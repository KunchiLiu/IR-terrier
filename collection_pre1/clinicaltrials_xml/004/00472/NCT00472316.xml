	<brief_summary>This study design cluster-randomized trial . The cluster unit community level . Communities randomize 1 2 study arm : DOTS+ACF DOTS . Communities DOTS+ACF arm receive door-to-door symptom screen entire population health care worker 2 4 time 9-month period . Those community DOTS-arm receive current standard care community ( PCF ) . All study community receive 4 6 visit community health worker annually part program ass follow-up illness household . Households ill resident visit often . The intervention study simply add 3 5 simple question current protocol . For subject respond positively question , result return subject home routine , standard care follow-up diagnostic treatment algorithm follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite free ARV drug free TB treatment , expand DOTS program , TB rate diminish city overall ( 29 ) , suggest DOTS alone sufficient turn tide . Nevertheless , elemental ACF strategy appear work well city . A prior International Collaborations Infectious Disease Research ( ICIDR ) , one area Rio de Janeiro , evaluate use WHO 's directly observe therapy , short course ( DOTS ) strategy versus enhance DOTS strategy ( DOTS-A ) , include household contact investigation mean identifying case . A statistically significant reduction incidence rate DOTS versus DOTS-A community see 2000 2002 ( Figure 2 ) , suggest ACF strategy instrumental reduce incidence rate subject detect treated . Treatment completion rate among new TB case significantly different statistically 2 study arm , however treatment completion rate overall increase 68 % 77 % course study . Overall , DOTS community exhibit little change ( +7 % ) TB incidence 5-year period , DOTS-A community show combined decrease ( -14 % ) ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . The difference suggest large scale ACF campaign intensive level ( ie , door-to-door case find ) could significant impact long-term TB incidence community .</detailed_description>
