	<brief_title>Metabolic Cost Savings Transtibial Amputees Wearing Controlled Energy Storage Return ( CESR ) Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amputees work harder great oxygen cost ambulation compare without limb loss . Therefore , amputees generally walk slow tire easily intact individual . The loss ankle propulsive supportive joint require amputee perform extra muscular work hip , trunk contralateral limb ambulation . This increase muscular activity consume additional metabolic energy mean amputees work harder walk speed intact individual . For amputee , extra effort simply possible , loss functional ambulation lead progressive spiral disuse , reduce capacity disuse . Conversely , great mobility lead great activity even successful return workplace . The health consequence amputees maintain functional ambulation multifactorial costly , term dollar institution commit care , also individual term decrease quality life , increased disability pain . Recent development result design novel prosthetic foot use energy compressive force heel contact , store throughout midstance release optimal instant push-off late stance . This unique design , Controlled Energy Storage Release ( CESR ) develop team University Michigan , Ann Arbor show reduce metabolic cost penalty prosthetic ambulation ( i.e . increase cost normal walk ) 50 % compare standard SACH foot , yet intact individual wear aircast boot equip prosthetic foot study . It likely increase energy saving also observe transtibial amputee . Young , active amputee soon enter VA system follow operation Iraq Afghanistan , energy improvement may benefit new VA patient population . The CESR foot may also provide substantial metabolic cost saving old less active amputee currently VA system . By improve gait efficiency amputee well able keep demand functional ambulation , remain active postpone many debilitate consequence limited mobility . Therefore propose first refine design CESR foot focus energy storage energy release mechanism CESR foot . Several spring characteristic may prove optimal certain subject depend upon weight walk characteristic . This iterative optimization process power generation absorption characteristic CESR foot evaluate use computerized gait analysis lesson use refinement . The second phase involve three week wear-testing trial determine improvement gait economy , reduction fatigue , improvement comfort , increase amount daily walk achieve . A validated questionnaire utilized determine amputee 's comfort fatigue three week trial conventional foot CESR foot . Step count perform individual entire 3 week period conventional foot CESR foot . We collect full body gait kinematics ( motion ) kinetics ( force ) use Vicon 612 system , metabolic measurement use VmaxST calculate oxygen cost 24 transtibial amputee walk CESR foot conventional foot . This permit calculation energy storage release foot inverse dynamic calculate net effect upon metabolic energy cost saving ambulation several speed . If CESR foot successful amputee gait domain , next step perform multi-center study VA motion laboratory , eventually collaborate Ohio Willow Wood , prominent prosthetic manufacturer express interest bring CESR foot market .</detailed_description>
