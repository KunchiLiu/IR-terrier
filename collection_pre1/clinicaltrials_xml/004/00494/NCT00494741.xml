	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The introduction triple-therapy regimen include calcineurin inhibitor , steroid , azathioprine ( AZA ) mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) greatly reduce risk acute rejection renal transplantation . However , long-term use calcineurin inhibitor steroid associate serious toxicity ultimately impact patient graft survival . Minimisation chronic immunosuppression therefore paramount importance improve patient graft survival . Thus , quest strategy induce specific immune hyporesponsiveness even tolerance - ideally via short-term intervention would target pathogenic immune response leave protective host immune response unimpaired - provide `` holy grail '' transplant immunologist . We recently find induction therapy basiliximab low ( one fourth ) conventional dos Rabbit Anti-human Thymocyte Globulin ( RATG ) , combine low-dose CsA MMF maintenance therapy , allow ineffective prevention acute rejection without steroid . Of note , unlike induction protocol `` standard '' RATG dos , regimen extremely well tolerate , avoid risk acute cytolysis reaction , reduce incidence immuno-hemolytic anemia need red blood cell transfusion . Moreover , approach increase risk CMV reactivations lymphoproliferative disorder , even compare standard triple immunosuppressive regimen without induction therapy . The dos CsA employ protocol half dos currently use clinical practice . However , even low dos report significant toxicity , long-term , may adversely affect graft function survival . Thus , implement innovative immunosuppressive strategy allow early safely withdraw calcineurin inhibitor therapy might major clinical implication term improve kidney function long term survival . This would also avoid adverse effect chronic CsA therapy arterial blood pressure , lipid profile blood glucose , altogether , remarkably increase overall cardiovascular risk patient . To purpose , induction therapy basiliximab plus low-dose RATG might help induce condition reduce immuno-responsiveness might allow sequentially withdraw steroid CsA without adversely affect outcome graft . Evidence MMF suppress production anti-HLA antibody , inhibits recruitment mononuclear cell allograft , well proliferation arterial smooth muscle cell , take suggest MMF might play important protective effect development progression CAN . Thus , immunosuppressive regimen base low-dose MMF sole antirejection drug would avoid chronic toxicity steroid , calcineurin inhibitor , would also limit risk CAN , main cause allograft loss long-term . On hand , however , Mycophenolate Steroid Sparing ( MYSS ) trial find AZA effective MMF prevent acute allograft rejection CsA-treated kidney transplant recipient , even steroid withdrawal . Since acute allograft rejection one strong predictor CAN , find take suggest , long-term , AZA might share MMF also similar protective effect development CAN . Moreover , must emphasize chronic CsA nephrotoxicity major component CAN . Thus , prevalence severity CAN may reduce patient CsA-free immunosuppressive regimen . In clinical setting , benefit MMF development CAN might appreciably exceed AZA . Should case , AZA might confer benefit MMF , remarkably low cost since , equivalent dos , AZA 15 time less expensive MMF . Regardless , MMF AZA monotherapy would avoid limit complication chronic immunosuppressive regimen include steroid calcineurin inhibitor , metabolic , osteomuscular cardiovascular disease , cancer opportunistic infection . AIMS Primary To compare incidence CAN 3 year post-transplantation patient receive induction therapy basiliximab low-dose RATG randomize maintenance immunosuppression low-dose MMF AZA monotherapy . Secondary 1. year - To assess overall cumulative incidence ( regardless randomization ) acute rejection tubulitis 1-year histology evaluation - To compare cumulative incidence acute rejection tubulitis two treatment group 2. year - To assess overall cumulative incidence ( regardless randomization ) biopsy-proven acute rejection CsA taper - To compare cumulative incidence biopsy-proven acute rejection two treatment group 3. year - To assess overall incidence ( regardless treatment randomization ) CAN possible relationship histology change 3 year histology finding pre-transplant ( baseline ) kidney evaluation previous acute rejection episode observe CsA withdrawal - To asses global ( vascular , glomerular tubular-interstitial ) score chronic histology change compare baseline study group whole , two treatment arm within two subgroup complete complete CsA withdrawal 4. year - To assess patient graft survival function , incidence CAN , possible relationship histology change 4 year histology finding baseline 3 year post-transplant , previous acute rejection episodes observed CsA withdrawal - To compare overall patient graft survival function , incidence CAN global histology score two treatment group . DESIGN Two-hundred-twenty-four kidney transplant recipient decease donor give induction therapy two 20 mg basiliximab injection 4 day apart , seven-day course RATG ( 0.5 mg/kg/day ) intravenous methylprednisolone six day , randomly allocate 1:1 basis 3-year treatment low-dose MMF AZA , added-on CsA maintenance therapy . At 1 year , rejection-free patient evidence tubulitis kidney biopsy progressively taper/withdraw CsA kidney biopsy 3 year post-transplant evaluating presence severity CAN . Should cumulative incidence acute rejection exceed 15 % CsA withdrawal study stop . Should incidence differ &gt; 30 % two treatment arm , patient give effective treatment follow continue . A final biopsy repeat 4 year post-transplant .</detailed_description>
