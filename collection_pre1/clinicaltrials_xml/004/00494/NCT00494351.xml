	<brief_title>Study Effect NdYag Laser Treatment Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS ) chronic suppurative recurrent disease apocrine gland . Histological study suggest disease follicle apocrine involvement secondary event . There limited efficacy medical treatment high morbidity surgical treatment . Limited data available short long term efficacy laser treatment use HS . 2 . Purpose study : To investigate efficacy NdYag 1064nm laser treatment hidradenitis suppurativa . 3 . Significance : Hidradenitis suppurativa chronic , often suppurative skin condition affect primarily hair follicle . A variety therapy use treat HS , often unsatisfactory result . As Nd Yag laser highly effective laser treatment hair removal well treatment deeper follicular disorder skin associate inflammation , postulate Nd Yag may highly effective decrease inflammation , pain , suppuration frequency recurrence HS . 4 . Study design : - treat patient HS Hurley Stage II one side body long-pulsed Nd : YAG laser . - The control patient 's opposite symmetrical side body . - Pre-treatment assessment perform along Hidradenitis Suppurativa European Research Group ( HISERG ) scale . - The control patient 's opposite symmetrical side body . - Each patient treat monthly basis 4 month , 2 month follow observe long term effect treatment detect relapse . - A study primary investigator treat dissect cellulitis , also follicular disease like HS , long-pulsed Nd : YAG laser aim determination capability limitation modality respect reduce pu formation ; enable termination systemic treatment ; investigate side-effect profile include dyspigmentation scar alopecia ; terminate disease process . The study show one year initiate laser treatment , patient achieve decreased pu formation , reduce reliance systemic treatment , control terminate disease process without dyspigmentation . 5 . Second phase study : - Two monthly laser session perform use long-pulsed Nd : YAG 1064 nm laser new set 19 patient . - Clinical response score use modify Hidradenitis Suppurativa Lesion Area Severity Index ( LASI ) . Histologic change examine treatment , 1 week , 1 month 2 month post-treatment . Histologic control obtain untreated , involved site .</detailed_description>
