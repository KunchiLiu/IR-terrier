	<brief_summary>There 140,000 new case colon cancer diagnose year , 60,000 Americans die colon cancer annually . To date , surgical resection remain mainstay treatment colon cancer . However , 35 % 45 % patient , despite colon surgery , retain unseen tumor cell bloodstream small clump liver tissue . It reason postoperative chemotherapy ( anti-tumor drug ) recommend give patient surgery . Conventional chemotherapy usually start early 4 6 week colon cancer resect . Despite surgery conventional chemotherapy , significant number patient develop cancer recurrence many go die cancer . For reason , investigator continue look new cancer treatment approach . The study consideration propose give colon cancer patient anti-cancer therapy 3 week 3 week undergoing operation remove colon cancer . This time period refer `` perioperative period . '' Presently , around world , doctor administer type anti-cancer therapy perioperative period . It belief investigator carry study period may ideal time fight tumor treatment give time may improve survival reduce cancer recurrence rate . Patients choose receive biologic anti-cancer treatment immediately surgery also receive conventional chemotherapy usual time ( 4-6 week surgery ) . Thus , perioperative anti-cancer treatment would interfere standard chemotherapy regimen use today . The drug give study call Cetuximab ( also know `` Erbitux '' ) . This anti-cancer drug already approve FDA use patient colon cancer . This drug , like anti-cancer drug use treat colon cancer , give either well surgery patient advance disease undergo surgery . What unique St. Luke 's Roosevelt study drug give 3 week surgery first 3 week colon resection surgery . To summarize , Cetuximab humanize antibody EGFR show effective kill tumor cell patient colon cancer . In study Cetuximab give 1 ) surgery , 2 ) immediately operation , 3 ) surgery . Entry study mean operation may delay least 3 week order drug give . Since many patient participate research study wait least long surgery constitute delay . The drug safety profile well tolerate , general . However , since thus far give week immediately prior immediately major surgery safety profile drug perioperative period . The primary goal preliminary study establish safety Cetuximab perioperative period demonstrate preoperative dos actual impact tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Perioperative Use Cetuximab Colon Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab 's tumor growth inhibitory mechanism directly block EGFR . After bind EGFR , antibody block signal transduction receptor subsequent inhibition tumor cell proliferation MMP expression . We hypothesize peri-operative weekly administration Cetuximab , humanize monoclonal antibody EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , 3 week immediately prior surgery 3 week immediately colon cancer surgery safe . This drug demonstrate effective Stage 4 colon cancer patient approve use colorectal cancer patient . Cetuximab never administer month immediately colon surgery . Establishing safety Cetuximab perioperative setting primary objective study .</detailed_description>

Patients Hepatitis B C HIV positive exclude . Patients receive chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 month anticipate surgery eligible . Patients bowel obstruction , emergency indication surgery , eligible . Pregnant nursing patient eligible entry study . All WOCBP must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior first receive investigational product . If pregnancy test positive , patient receive cetuximab eligible entry study . In addition , WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant ( e.g. , miss late menstrual period ) time study participation . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor associate unintentional pregnancy set . In addition , men enrol study understand risk sexual partner childbearing potential practice effective method birth control . ) The Investigator immediately notify IRB Bristol Meyers Squibb event confirm pregnancy patient participate study .</criteria>
