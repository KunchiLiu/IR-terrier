	<brief_summary>Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D ( LGMD2D ) genetic disease affect skeletal muscle . Insufficient level protein alpha-sarcoglycan result muscle weakness worsens time . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness gene therapy treat child adult LGMD2D .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assessment safety intramuscular administration alpha-sarcoglycan deficient subject recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 ( rAAV1 ) -human alpha-sarcoglycan gene ( hαSG ) vector control skeletal muscle creatine kinase promoter . The secondary objective determine dose rAAV1.tMCK.hαSG vector require achieve detectable level alpha-sarcoglycan muscle subject disorder . A recombinant virus vector construct AAV1 alter carry human alpha-sarcoglycan gene express tMCK promoter . The construct show initiate production functional alpha-sarcoglycan protein laboratory animal . This construct reverse dystrophic phenotype alpha-sarcoglycan knock mouse , laboratory animal model clinical disorder . Intramuscular injection rAAV1 restore muscle histology normal increase muscle strength level exceed control knock mouse degree wild-type mouse . The propose human clinical trial phase I , double-blind randomize protocol injection rAAV1.tMCK.hαSG gene vector muscle . Two cohort subject LGMD2D ( alpha-sarcoglycan deficiency ) , proven mutation undergo gene transfer . A minimum three subject enrol cohort . The first cohort receive total 1.5 ml volume study agent two six separate injection select muscle ( extensor digitorum brevis ) muscle appropriate consider individual patient ) dose 3.25 X 10 11 vg 1.5 ml . The anatomical midline point muscle identify skin 2 6 vector injection distribute direction X . The second cohort receive dose deliver muscle accord paradigm . In cohort , one extremity receive vector transgene opposite extremity inject placebo . On day vector infusion , 4 hour gene transfer , patient receive intravenous methylprednisolone 2.0 mg/kg ( exceed 1 gm total ) , repeat dos two consecutive morning . The methylprednisolone specifically give diminish immediate inflammation needle injection , know arouse inflammatory reaction could contribute bring antigen present cell site vector delivery . We previously demonstrate treatment enhances gene expression least 2-fold ( Included part BB-IND-12936 minidystrophin gene transfer ) . Safety endpoint assess include inflammatory reaction vector , evaluate muscle biopsy , change hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis , immunologic response rAAV1 alpha-sarcoglycan , report history observation symptom . The patient 10 12 follow-up visit next 2 year initial infusion .</detailed_description>
