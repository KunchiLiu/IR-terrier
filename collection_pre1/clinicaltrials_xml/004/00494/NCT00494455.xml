	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperglycemia associate complication high morbidity mortality critically ill patient . Therefore , strict glycemic control target blood glucose level 80 110 mg/dl recommend . Intensive insulin therapy require continuous intravenous insulin infusion accord algorithm frequent blood glucose measurement . Implementation intensive insulin therapy increase workload physician especially nurse . Continuous glucose measurement would facilitate blood glucose control critically ill patient . Numerous study show accuracy subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring derive glucose value compare blood glucose measurement diabetic . Studies evaluate subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor inpatient-population especially ICU-setting rare . Therefore aim study prospective evaluation continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring critically ill patient circulatory shock demand norepinephrine therapy compare critically ill patient without shock .</detailed_description>
