	<brief_summary>The middle ear airspace locate behind eardrum consist two connecting compartment . The compartment directly behind eardrum call tympanum contains three small bone middle ear , hammer , anvil stapes , function transfer eardrum movement inner ear hear . Behind tympanum mastoid cavity large airspace subdivide small air cell unknown function . For normal hearing , important air pressure middle ear similar environment eardrum move freely response sound . The air pressure environment constant affect change weather condition ( high low pressure system move area ) change elevation sea level ( fullness ear notice ride elevator airplane ) . The air pressure middle ear also change middle ear gas constantly leak airspace blood flow wall middle ear . These effect ( change environmental air pressure change middle ear air pressure ) independent cause middle ear environmental pressure different . Periodically swallow yawning , exist difference middle ear environmental air pressure reset zero open biological tube ( Eustachian tube ) connect middle ear back nose . This allow gas flow middle ear environment increase decrease middle ear pressure level environment time . Most people open Eustachian tube number automatic opening varies infrequent often population . Whether person 's usual frequency Eustachian opening good enough keep middle ear pressure environmental level depend fast gas lose middle ear gas leakage ( diffusion ) blood . For example , ears slow rate gas loss , Eustachian tube need open frequently keep middle ear environmental pressure . Some researcher believe mastoid compartment function control rate gas loss blood , large mastoid volume associate less rate middle ear gas loss . In experiment , investigator plan test measure mastoid tympanum volume use Computer tomography ( CT ) rate blood middle ear gas transfer use technique involves breathe air contains laugh gas ( Nitrous Oxide=N2O ) measure middle ear pressure change use tympanometry ( technique involve put ear plug ear canal measuring pressure ) . From past study patient undergo short surgical dental procedure , investigator know breathe gas mixture contain N2O increase blood level gas , cause gas go blood middle ear increase middle ear pressure . The investigator predict rate change middle ear pressure breathe gas mixture contain 25 % N2O normal oxygen level ( 20 % ) air less ear large mastoid volume . If investigator prediction correct , able explain ear large mastoid volume well able keep pressure like environment even Eustachian tube open often .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The middle ear ( ME ) pressure balance important contributor maintenance ME health . ME pressure measure number contain gas mole process add remove gas mole relatively fixed volume ME cavity change pressure . Three route ME gas exchange identify ; 1 ) passive , gradient-dependent specie exchange local blood via diffusion across ME mucosa ; 2 ) passive , gradient-dependent specie exchange ambient environment via diffusion across tympanic membrane , 3 ) bolus exchange mixed gas nasopharynx ME transient opening Eustachian tube . Total ME pressure trajectory ME pressure specify condition depend relative rate specie gas exchange across pathway . The ME airspace subdivide two compartment , anterior tympanum posterior mastoid air cell system ( MACS ) . Theory suggest transmucosal gas exchange rate ME ( transMEM ) may different tympanum MACS possibility important implication respect role MACS ME pressure regulation protection ME disease . This study measure rate inert gas exchange across mucosa two ME compartment adult . These data fit model gas exchange parameterized base relative surface area volumes two compartment , hypothesis volume gas exchange across MACS mucosa less tympanum test . The result use reject confirm one mechanism large MACS volume protect otitis medium certain condition .</detailed_description>
