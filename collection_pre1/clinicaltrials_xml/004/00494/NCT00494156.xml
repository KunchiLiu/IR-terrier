	<brief_summary>Originally think rare occurrence , BCVI diagnose approximately 1 % blunt trauma patient . Initially BCVI think unavoidable devastate neurologic outcome . But early report suggest anticoagulation might decrease event . If untreated , carotid artery injury ( CAI ) stoke rate 50 % depend injury grade , increase stroke rate correlate increase grades injury . Current study report early treatment antithrombotics - either heparin anti-platelet agent - patient BCVI markedly reduce stroke rate resultant neurologic morbidity . As report bleed complication alter heparin protocol patient , use antiplatelet agent attractive . Although heparin propose gold standard treatment due initial empiric use , comparative study antithrombotic agent perform . In sum , Grade I-III blunt carotid vertebral arterial injury ( BCVI ) potential stroke , treat . Heparin show clearly improve heal rate compare antiplatelet therapy . The purpose study determine whether systemic anticoagulation alters course Grade I-III BCVI compare antiplatelet therapy . The investigator study hypothesis Grade I-III BCVI heal progress pseudoaneurysm formation , independent systemic antithrombotic regimen , combination aspirin clopidogrel equally efficacious prevent neurologic symptom compare systemic heparin associate Grade I-III BCVI .</brief_summary>
