	<brief_title>Effects Rocking Postoperative Ileus Duration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ileus lack bowel function cause colic , vomit , and/or constipation . Research show bowel function slow possibly stops work short period time surgery , usually 5-7 day . Patients report pain discomfort gas build bowel time bowel begin work properly surgery . During period bowel work surgery , patient leave hospital physician sure bowel function return . The return bowel function usually signal passage gas rectum . The main method use help return bowel function patient get bed , sit chair , begin walk first day surgery increase time sit chair walk every day . However , clear sit chair walk best method assist fast return bowel function . One method show promise help return bowel function abdominal surgery rock rock chair . Rocking chair motion demonstrate early return normal bowel function mother C-Section woman abdominal hysterectomy ( Moore et al.,1995 ; Thomas et al. , 1990 ) . Rocking also use decrease pain , amount pain medication need , time spent hospital abdominal surgery . If agree take part study , randomly assign one two group ( Group A B ) . Participants Group A use rock chair method . Participants Group B use rock chair method . There equal chance assign either group . Before take part study , ask complete survey amount pain currently experience ( Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form ) . It take 10 minute complete Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form . Completing pain inventory surgery allow good comparison pre postoperative surgical gas pain . You ask provide information age marital status record cod data sheet . You also receive instruction sheet describes need order participate study ( Instruction Subjects Sheet ) . The study investigator also demonstrate chosen rock group correct method rock rock chair allow time practice . He also demonstrate correct way wear gait belt pedometer attach . Participants Group A get bed begin first day surgery , sit rock chair ( least twice per day ) , rock backward forward constant rate 1 backward forward rock per second 10-20 minute increment . This do least 60 minute ( 1 hour ) per day . Participants Group A also ask begin walk least twice per day begin first day surgery . Participants Group B get bed begin first day surgery sit non rock chair ( least twice per day ) least sixty minute . Group B also ask begin walk least twice per day . Both group wear pedometer attach gait belt wear around waist order record number step take 24-hour period time . A pedometer also attach rock chair order record number rock 24-hour period . Participants group encourage research staff increase time spent rocking , sit non-rocking chair , walk day . You give pain medication need . All participant give pencil pad note date time first pas gas rectum . A calendar clock available patient room . Every morning , study investigator visit ask pass gas , record number rock step record pedometer , reset pedometer , complete Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form pain evaluation , check total amount pain medication receive last 24 hour . You may increase time spent rock walk desire encourage . If reason , tolerate rock rock chair , sit non rock chair walk discomfort reason , remove study without penalty . There follow-up testing study . The length study first day surgery actually pass gas rectum . This time could range 5 7 day operation . This investigational study . There drug involve study . Rocking , non rock chair , gait belt provide M. D. Anderson pedometer study investigator charge participant study . A total 66 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
