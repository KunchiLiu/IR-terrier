	<brief_title>CEP-701 PH-negative Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : CEP-701 design help prevent certain type molecule ( call mutate JAK2 receptor ) find myelofibrosis cell send continuous chemical signal lead growth cancer cell . Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , take CEP-701 mouth ( liquid form ) 2 time day ( morning evening ) every day 30-day repeating cycle . You take dose 12 hour apart . The study doctor nurse teach and/or caregiver family member prepare dose study drug , well much take time . At study visit , supply enough syrinx , dose cup , study drug last next study visit . For dose , use syringe draw proper amount CEP-701 . You add entire content syringe approve juice 1 provide dose cup . You also drink additional dosing cup juice take drug dose . The following juice ( 100 % juice ) approve use CEP-701 : grape , pineapple , apple , V8 vegetable juice , orange juice . The study drug mixture may store ( area protect light , cabinet ) 1 hour room temperature 8 hour refrigerate ( 35°F 45 °F ) . If miss dose , take another dose next schedule dose . Study Visits : You initially study visit M. D. Anderson month . You need return monthly 6 month , every 3 month side effect previous 3 cycle . After 2 year therapy , visit extend every 6 month . After 6 cycle may either study visit phone call member study staff . If phone call , ask feeling , experienced side effect since last visit , blood test review . During study visit , follow test : - You physical exam . - You ask feel side effect may experience since last visit . - You blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check kidney liver function blood cell count . This do every 2 week 3 month , every 1-2 month . - You bone marrow/aspirate every 3-6 month see respond treatment . After 2 year therapy , extend every 12 month . Length Study : You continue study least 6 month allow time response . If respond study treatment , may continue receive cycle 5 year . If respond study treatment within 6 month , disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , illness keep take study drug , doctor think best interest stop take part study , take study . This investigational study . CEP-701 Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve commercially available . At time , use research purpose study . Up 41 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
