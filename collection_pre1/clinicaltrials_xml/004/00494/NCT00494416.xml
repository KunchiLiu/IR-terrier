	<detailed_description>Pregnant woman susceptible malaria non-pregnant woman , particular first pregnancy . Malaria infection pregnant woman may cause anaemia , illness abortion stillbirth . It may also cause low birth weight placental infection . In Africa burden malaria pregnancy high remote rural area . IPT sulphadoxine - pyrimethamine ( SP ) demonstrate effective preventing pregnancy relate malaria ( anaemia , clinical case placenta infection ) , beneficial baby pregnant woman , increase ANC attendance . In many Sub - Saharan African country , IPT / SP adopt replace chloroquine ( CQ ) chemoprophylaxis show longer efficacious . IPT/SP adopt 2005 The Ministry Health ( MoH ) Burkina Faso replace chemoprophylaxis CQ . The new strategy implement delivery approach define presumably IPT/SP deliver pregnant woman present ANC visit . Although expect compliance well previous CQ weekly regime , would importance ensure good coverage high compliance make new strategy effective . Therefore , order obtain efficient IPT / SP programme good level compliance coverage , several delivery approach beside use ANC alone explore . It hypothesize IPT strategy use SP inefficient chemoprophylaxis CQ effective delivery approach use . General Objective : assess different IPT/SP delivery approach rural Burkina Faso aim improve coverage compliance among pregnant woman . Specific objective : - To implement three approach IPT/SP delivery pregnant woman base health centre distribution , addition community base distribution either health service community member ; - To compare effect approach compliance coverage IPT / SP feasibility . Material &amp; Methods The research implement Burkina Faso . Malaria endemic seasonal transmission responsible considerable ill health among pregnant woman . The study site situate rural area Pissy health district cover western peri-urban zone Ouagadougou city adjacent rural area . There total 25 health facility district ( rural urban ) reference hospital Ouagadougou . In 2004 population district approx . 542000 inhabitant . The estimated number pregnancy 27000 . There generally low attendance antenatal care ( ANC ) 15 % baby bear LBW . In study carry Boromo rural district , 51 % pregnant woman 2 ANC visit delivery ( Coulibaly , personal communication ) . HIV infection prevalence find around 4 % whole country ( MoH , 2005 ) indication different Pissy district catchment area . The study participant include pregnant woman irrespective gravidity reside study area reachable approach apply zone . It prospective comparative study 3 different approach deliver IPT / SP catchment area rural health facility . The approach follow : 1 . Passive health centre base delivery approach ( PHC ) . IPT/SP deliver pregnant woman present health centre either ANC visit care seek consultation . Drugs administer directly observe treatment ( DOT ) . Some collation may give woman refuse take drug eaten . This approach , likely apply MOH , serve control one . 2 . Joint method , advanced strategy delivery approach ( JAS ) . In addition passive delivery health centre , pregnant woman reach preventive activity health staff carry regularly village , immunization , health promotion , even ANC visit . The woman ask present health staff treatment IPT/SP administer DOT . 3 . Community base distribution delivery approach ( CBD ) . In addition passive delivery health centre , pregnant woman reach traditional birth attendant ( TBAs ) representative village woman 's association ( RWAs ) . The IPT/SP deliver also DOT . The two community - directed approach develop workshop health staff , community , resource person adapt local situation . Each approach implement zone constituted catchment area number health centre cover require sample size . The zone select order avoid contamination randomly assign delivery approach . The main outcome measure : ) coverage IPT ( proportion pregnant woman administer treatment ) , b ) compliance ( number administer dos per pregnant woman ) , c ) infection prevalence , ) Hb rate , e ) relevant difficulty constraint approach , f ) acceptability population health staff g ) performance approach deliver IPT /SP . The sample size calculated measure difference group 10 % IPT administration coverage . Assuming require 80 % power ( zβ = 0.84 ) detect significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05 ; zα/2 =1.96 ) intervention increase coverage 10 % , group compose n = 3841 pregnant woman . Assuming design effect 1.5 , n = 5762 woman . The 3 geographical zone define cover 5800 expected pregnancy . Cross sectional survey carry begin , end study period . The first aim ensure study zone comparable regard outcome ) b ) c ) ) later comparison zone . Furthermore , SP measure urine use dipstick compliance measurement . An anthropological component ass part main outcomes e ) f ) health staff , community , pregnant woman . Questionnaires , focus group discussion ( FGD ) in-depth interview ( IDI ) use cross-sectional survey data collection . Data pregnancy IPT record personal ANC book credible . The sample size calculated representative population different village zone . Data IPT / SP delivery also collect record hold health centre TBAs / RWAs measure main outcome e ) . Specific record different health centre 's record open IPT/SP delivery site , include TBAs / RWAs , register information treat pregnant woman . The information personal data ( name , age , village , marital status , profession ) , data current previous pregnancy ( rank pregnancy , child , ANC visit , drug give ) medical history ( previous adverse reaction drug , fever , malaria attack ) , administer IPT/SP dos . As usual , IPT / SP treatment receive recorded woman 's personal ANC book proof use , include cross sectional survey . Quantitative data regularly enter Epi Info software analyse use Stata version 9 . Qualitative data process report produce . Proportions compare ANOVA mean student test . Training session organize caregiver harmonize IPT administration ( yet practice Burkina Faso ) study implementation study zone . The PI undertake monthly supervision zone . During preparation phase , information gather good understand health district centre organization function system regard ANC malaria prevention . Study period The study carry 24 month June 2007 .</detailed_description>
