	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate functional utility general mobility ( walk ) new high power permanent peripheral prism glass , provide visual field expansion device patient homonymous hemianopia ( complete loss half field vision side eyes ) . The efficacy real peripheral prism glass assess relative sham peripheral prism glass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Peripheral Prism Glasses Hemianopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hemianopic field loss unaware object blind ( non-seeing ) hemi-field often experience difficulty mobility navigation , walk obstacle side field loss . In 2000 , Peli ( 2000 ) describe new peripheral-prism design prismatic correction hemianopia , address many inadequacy exist design hemianopic visual aid , produce true field expansion ( i.e . simultaneously see field large device without ) . In collaboration Schepens Eye Research Institute ( Boston , MA ) , Chadwick Optical Inc ( White River Junction , VT ) develop permanent form Fresnel prism segment , make acrylic material embed plastic spectacle lens . These permanent prism offer good cosmesis , optical quality durability temporary 40 prism-diopter press-on Fresnel prism segment use previous evaluation peripheral prism system . In study evaluate new high-power ( 57 prism diopter ) permanent peripheral prism glass . The study employ crossover design participant wear pair real prism glass ( high-power , 57 prism diopter ) pair sham prism glass ( low-power , 5 prism diopter , provide little field expansion ) counterbalance order . The efficacy real prism glass relative sham prism glass assess general mobility ( walk ) . We expect participant prefer real prism glass sham prism glass former helpful obstacle detection walk . Prism glass fit Low Vision Practitioners community-based Vision Rehabilitation Clinics . After wear first pair glass 4 week , participant return in-office follow visit , questionnaire administer record experience wear glass . The second pair prism glass fit . Another questionnaire administer 4 week later record experience wear second set glass . At end period wear second pair prism glass , clinical decision make whether participant continue use real prism glass ( e.g . participant find prism glass helpful obstacle avoidance walk ) . For participant continue prism glass , final telephone follow-up interview conduct 6 month .</detailed_description>
