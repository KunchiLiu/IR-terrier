	<brief_title>Preventing ESRD Overt Nephropathy Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Nephropathy type 2 diabetes lead cause end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Currently , 50 % patient renal replacement therapy US diabetic . The yearly incidence diabetic progress ESRD proportion ESRD patient diabetes progressively increase due progressively increase prevalence type 2 diabetes worldwide . Two large , multinational trial overt nephropathy type 2 diabetes find interruption renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARBs ) reduce incidence ESRD 30 % , appreciable effect cardiovascular mortality . On basis finding , ARB therapy become standard treatment patient type 2 diabetes nephropathy . However , despite ARB treatment , 7 % patient continue progress ESRD 7 % continue die every year . Large-scale randomized trial evaluate nephro- cardio-protective effect RAS inhibition angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor overt nephropathy type 2 diabetes miss . However , study patient type 1 diabetic nephropathy show ACE inhibitor therapy may decrease progression ESRD 40 % cardiovascular mortality 50 % . Similar study non diabetic chronic nephropathy . consistently find 40-50 % reduction risk progression ESRD ACE inhibitor compare non-RAS inhibitor therapy . Moreover , meta-analysis study include type 2 diabetic patient different degree renal involvement show ACE inhibitor ARBs shear similar renoprotective effect , ACE inhibitor significantly decrease cardiovascular mortality . A recent trial non diabetic nephropathy find combined RAS inhibition ARBs ACE inhibitor decrease progression ESRD 50 % compare ARB ACE inhibition alone . Evidence combine therapy effectively ACE inhibitor ARB therapy alone reduce albuminuria proteinuria patient type 2 diabetes , suggest similar renoprotective effect could achieve also overt nephropathy type 2 diabetes . Indeed , short-term proteinuria reduction strong predictor slow progression renal disease reduce cardiovascular mortality long term . A randomized trial power detect reduce incidence ESRD cardiovascular mortality combine ARB ACE inhibition compare ACE inhibition ARB alone would require several thousand patient . However , identify high risk patient may benefit nephro- cardio-protective therapy would allow design adequately powered trial remarkably less patient . By use Bayesian decision-tree analysis identify , among patient include RENAAL study , subgroup high risk patient baseline serum creatinine 1.8 mg/dl spot morning urine albumin creatinine ratio &gt; 1000mg/g . Of note , 3.5 year follow-up , 70 % high-risk patient progress ESRD despite ARB therapy . Thus , incidence ESRD three-fold high high-risk patient ( 20 % ) whole study group ( 6.8 % ) . High risk patient clinical characteristic therefore ideal target randomize clinical trial aim evaluate effect novel nephro- , possibly , cardio-protective treatment overt nephropathy type 2 diabetes . Thus , whether dual single drug RAS blockade reduces need renal replacement therapy high risk patient type 2 diabetes whether ACE inhibitor shear ARBs similar even superior beneficial effect typology patient worth investigate . This could clinical relevance term : 1 . Effective prevention ESRD people type 2 diabetes expect translate remarkable reduction cost renal replacement therapy chronic dialysis kidney transplantation ; 2 . A good definition cost/effectiveness profile different study treatment may help optimize allocation available resource order achieve effective prevention lower cost . 3 . The definition individual risk profile may allow identify subject increase risk may benefit intensified treatment , translate optimization use available resource population level . Moreover , addition verify whether dual RAS blockade combine ACE inhibitor ARB treatment effectively single drug RAS blockade may prevent progression ESRD , present study offer opportunity compare renoprotective effect equivalent dos ACE inhibitor ARBs . Aims Primary To evaluate whether , comparable blood pressure control , dual RAS blockade combine therapy halve dos benazepril ( 10 mg/day ) valsartan ( 160 mg/day ) reduce incidence ESRD effectively single drug RAS blockade full dos valsartan ( 320 mg/day ) give alone high-risk patient type 2 diabetes overt nephropathy . Secondary - To evaluate whether , comparable blood pressure control , dual RAS blockade combine therapy halve dos benazepril ( 10 mg/day ) valsartan ( 160 mg/day ) reduce incidence ESRD effectively single drug RAS blockade full dos benazepril ( 20 mg/day ) give alone high-risk patient type 2 diabetes overt nephropathy . - To evaluate whether , comparable blood pressure control , effect benazepril valsartan therapy similar whether , alternatively , one two treatment offer superior protective effect progression ESRD study population . - To evaluate effect three study treatment incidence fatal non-fatal cardiovascular event , double baseline serum creatinine , GFR decline proteinuria , - To assess relationship , study group whole within treatment group , renal outcome variable ( ESRD , double serum creatinine , GFR decline , proteinuria ) fatal non-fatal cardiovascular event , achieve blood pressure metabolic control renal and/or cardiovascular outcome variable achieve proteinuria reduction residual follow-up proteinuria renal and/or cardiovascular outcome variable . Design This multicenter , Prospective , Randomized , Open label , Blinded End point ( PROBE ) trial 3-year treatment halve dos benazepril ( 10 mg/day ) valsartan ( 160 mg/day ) give combination , full dos benazepril ( 20 mg/day ) , valsartan ( 320 mg/day ) give alone 102 consent patient &gt; 40 year old , type 2 diabetes ( WHO criteria ) , serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dl &lt; 3.5 mg/dl , spot morning urine albumin creatinine ratio &gt; 1000mg/g patient without previous ACE inhibitor ARB therapy &gt; 500mg/g patient previous ACE inhibitor ARB therapy specific contraindication study drug . Primary efficacy variable ESRD primary comparison benazepril plus valsartan valsartan alone group . The analysis 80 % power detect ( p=0.05 , two-side test ) 50 % difference ESRD incidence .</detailed_description>
