	<detailed_description>Autism pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder prominent reciprocal social communication impairment restrict repetitive behavior interest . Based number symptom functional impairment , autistic disorder , Asperger disorder , atypical autism ( PDDNOS ) conceptualize autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Most recent survey estimate prevalence narrow diagnosis autistic disorder around 0.1 % 0.2 % , 0.59 % 0.63 % ASD , four-fold male predominance . Due high heritability ( &gt; 0.9 ) , high family recurrence risk ( Î» = 60 ) , severe impairment without effective prevention treatment available ASD , disastrous disease prioritize molecular genetic study public health perspective . The propose research first systematic approach combine clinical molecular genetic study ASD involve multi-sites three research core : assessment core ( Gau SS Wu YY ) , molecular genetics core ( Chen CH ) , data/statistics core ( Gau SS ) . The long-term objective study establish clinical genetic database autism family etiology study , exploration pathogenesis , develop new treatment . The specific aim : 1. establish psychometric property three Chinese version rating scale ASD : SCQ , SRS , ABC ; 2. collect clinical , neuropsychological , genetic data ASD probands family 3. identify genetic variant close etiological gene ASD Taiwanese sample use candidate gene case-control association study design ( e.g. , Neuroligin gene family , MeCP2 gene , FOXP2 gene , parent trio population-based study ) whole genome linkage analysis multiplex family . After well-preparation instrument , DNA collection procedure , assessor 's training first 6 month , recruit 40 , 170 , 90 ASD family first , second , third year project , respectively . The instrument include ADI-R , ADOS , K-SADS-E , SCQ , SRS , ABC measure autistic psychopathology ; WISC-III , MSEL PPVT cognitive ability ; CPT , CANTAB , WCST neuropsychological functioning , MRI , MRS , DSI brain imaging study . We anticipate establishment database 300 ASD family , completion mutation screen several candidate gene , determination association ASD intermediate phenotype sample . The identification susceptible gene ASD would major breakthrough child psychiatry revelation would facilitate scientific diagnosis autism result , would shed light pathogenesis autism contribute development novel , specific effective treatment devastate disease .</detailed_description>
