	<brief_title>Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Evaluation Three Different Doses Zolpidem Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The consequence sleep deprivation productivity individual society extensive . ( Most clinician patient believe insomnia becomes clinical problem require therapy excessive daytime sleepiness impairs cognition mood , interfere patient 's performance function require alertness . Chronic sleep deprivation often lead adverse personal , medical psychiatric complication , underscore common request patient treatment physician . With increase focus problem sleep deprivation child age , appreciation scope problem expand . It estimate 40 % infant experience difficulty settle frequent nighttime waking sleep disturbance include bedtime resistance , delay onset sleep , disruptive night waking occur 25 50 % preschooler . In school-aged child , parent report incidence bedtime resistance 15 % child . Very limited data exist describe pharmacokinetics zolpidem pediatrics . Colle colleague report zolpidem clearance 3 time great child ( n=6 ) compare young adult ( n=104 ) though Cmax AUC value similar despite high zolpidem dose ( mg/Kg ) child . Unfortunately data raise question answer regard zolpidem disposition relative age highlight need comprehensively determine zolpidem disposition characteristic across broad age range pediatric subject . In summary , although researcher hesitant include child drug study , data indicate pediatric sleep disturbance negative health impact child warrant pharmacologic intervention . Studies identify appropriate drug dosage child age essential address health problem impact child his/her family .</detailed_description>
