	<detailed_description>The short long-term efficiency PCI limit in-stent restenosis ( ISR ) stent thrombosis . Expansion stent target artery induce local injury vessel wall , primarily disruption endothelial lining . Following injury , reparatory mechanism activate leading recovery endothelial coverage stent strut . Disruption endothelium cause activation adherence platelet ( minutes-hours ) recruitment monocyte leukocytes ( hour day ) . The time elapse endothelial disruption cause expanded stent full coverage strut new endothelial cell carry high risk in-stent thrombosis . During time frame , initial event ISR occur , - primarily migration proliferation smooth muscle cell . The key event rebuild endothelial layer stent strut recruitment circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) , adherence attachment surface stent vascular wall strut . The full coverage prothrombotic metal strut new endothelial cell reduce initially high risk thrombosis . The repair process complete 1 month bare metal stent use , 6 month DES implantation . The course event different implantation drug-eluting stent . Recruitment inflammatory cell well smooth muscle cell reduce slow . This effect associate reduce potential neointima formation ( ISR ) , also unfavorable lag reendothelialisation . As show study use angioscopy , thrombus formation DES strut see long 6 month PCI . The effect probably cause inhibitory effect immunosuppressive , antimitotic antiinflammatory drug release stent EPCs adhere place vascular injury strut . The use DES significantly reduce risk ISR , slow prolongation reparatory process may increase risk late in-stent thrombosis well unwanted effect , edge effect formation coronary aneurysm . The risk late thrombotic effect DES mainly associate discontinuation dual antiplatelet therapy , therefore treatment continue least 12 month even indefinitely . The following group patient particularly high risk in-stent thrombosis : acute coronary syndrome , cardiogenic shock , diabetes , procedure-related parameter ( coronary dissection , long lesion , small vessel diameter , use multiple stent ) . On hand , prolong dual anti-platelet therapy associate significant risk ( bleed , thrombocytopenia ) especially patient peptic ulcer disease elderly . Discontinuation therapy also indicate patient undergo surgery , may increase risk thrombotic event . The concept EPC-capture stent . Numerous study show circulate EPCs contribute repair endothelium injury , likely repopulating site stent implantation . The number circulate EPCs consider marker turnover endothelium , well promise marker cardiovascular risk . EPCs identify presence surface marker - CD34 , CD133 - vascular endothelial growth factor type 2 receptor ( VEGFR2 ) identify use label monoclonal antibody . Since EPCs represent pool cell contribute endothelial repair vascular injury , increase home retention cell site stent implantation may increase speed process endothelisation . Introduction bioengineered stent immobilise antibody CD34 antigen bound surface strut represent significant progress prevention thrombotic event . The surface BMS prim obtain biocompatible matrix murine monoclonal antibody human epitopes CD34 attach covalent binding . Animal Models Animal study reveal number EPCs attach stent strut significantly high 1 48 hour post implantation 48 hour , 70 % surface stent strut cover endothelial cell . The cell spindle shape aligned direction blood flow form confluent monolayer disperse stent strut . There also trend towards lesser intensity neointimal formation stenosis area comparison BMS 28 day . More 80 % cell capture monoclonal antibody express marker endothelial cell , 30 % cell positive EC marker surface BMS . The complete endothelial coverage observe 48 hour use EPC-capture stent significant degree endothelialisation present within 1 hour implantation . Clinical Trials EPC-capture stent receive CE mark commercially available since 2005 . So far , result two study carry patient stable CAD publish . First in-man study ( Healthy Endothelial Accelerated Lining Inhibits Neointimal Growth , HEALING-FIM ) demonstrate safety feasibility use EPC-capture stent ( Genous , OrbusNeich ) 16 patient stable CAD 100 % procedural success 6.3 % rate MACE 9-month follow-up . The multicenter HEALING II study include 63 patient stable CAD , 67 % hyperlipidemia , 16 % diabetes , 24 % history myocardial infarction 52 % positive family history CAD . Patients either de novo non-stented restenotic primarily type B2 C lesion target native coronary vessel diameter 2.5-3.5 9.83 mm average length enrol . At 6 9-months follow-up , clinically drive target lesion revascularisation ( TLR ) rate 6.3 % MACE rate 7.9 % . The binary restenosis 0 % late loss 0.48 mm . There additional event additional 18-months follow-up . The dual antiplatelet therapy maintain 1 month thrombotic event record . Importantly , angiographic control , late loss regress 18 % 6 18 month follow-up . Further important data available HEALING IIB ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT00349895 ) multicenter study control angiography 6 18 month complete . This study clarify role combine therapy statins implantation EPC capture stent . All 90 patient receive 80mg atorvastatin least 2 week prior procedure order achieve EPC mobilisation . In addition , manufacturer launch eHEALING real-life registry aim analyse outcomes 5000 patient EPC-capture stent implantation . So far 2500 patient include eHEALING registry . Statins EPC-capture stent Importantly , number circulate EPCs positively correlate favorable clinical outcome . Only patient low number EPC sustain MACE ISR 6 month follow-up , show endogenous capacity mobilise EPC important vascular heal stent implantation . HEALING II patient statins approximately twofold increase EPC number compare patient without statin . The safe efficient way mobilise cell statin therapy significantly increase number EPC , also improve functional capacity . This particularly important issue patient diabetes elderly , number EPCs significantly low comparison young non-diabetic subject . Also , functional capacity EPCs impair patient diabetes multiple CVD risk factor . So far trial addressed use Genous stent patient non ST-elevation ACS . Present randomize study prospectively compare EPC-capture stent bare metal stent concommitant high dose atorvastatin reduction neointimal formation assess quantitative coronary angiography IVUS . Also association function number circulate EPCs angiographic outcomes investigate .</detailed_description>
