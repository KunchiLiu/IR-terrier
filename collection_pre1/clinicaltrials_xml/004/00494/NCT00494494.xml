	<brief_summary>Purpose : Study effect nepafenac ophthalmic suspension 0.1 % prevent post-operative cystoid macular edema follow uncomplicated cataract surgery Participants : Patients cataract surgery UNC meet eligibility criterion Procedures ( method ) : Patients pre post-operative vision measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) testing , also cataract density intraoperative phacoemulsification parameter include ultrasound power ultrasound time measure . Patients randomize two group . Group 1 treat standard post-operative cataract management . Group 2 treat standard post-operative cataract management plus topical nepafenac one month . Post-operative macular thickness study analyze visual acuity OCT measurement two month post surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Nepafenac Post-operative Macular Swelling Following Uncomplicated Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan enroll 80 patient prospective randomized clinical trial . Eligible patient randomize two group . All patient pre-operative Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) vision measure pre-operative OCT ( Humphrey-Zeiss Medical Systems , San Leandro , CA ) eye . OCT measurement include total macular volume , central foveal thickness , average macular thickness . Pre-operatively , cataract grade use LOCS III classification system.10 Group 1 receive pre-operative topical nepafenac maintain intra-operative pupillary dilation standard care cataract surgery . Following surgery Group 1 treat standard post operative cataract treatment , include topical antibiotic topical corticosteroid . Group 2 also receive pre-operative topical nepafenac maintain intra-operative pupillary dilation . Following surgery patient Group 2 treat topical nepafenac , topical antibiotic , topical corticosteroid . Group 2 give 3ml bottle nepafenac take home instruct use three time per day one month . Intra-operative surgical parameter include ultrasound time average percent phacoemulsification power record surgery . All patient see post-operative day one , one week , one month , two month . At two month visit , best correct ETDRS vision OCT repeat eye . The two month visual acuity post-operative OCT analyze evaluate effect nepafenac CME follow cataract surgery . Wilcoxon sign rank test use compare pre-operative post-operative difference visual acuity OCT measurement . The Spearman correlation use compare variable study include cataract density , ultrasound time , average percent phacoemulsification power , OCT measurement .</detailed_description>
