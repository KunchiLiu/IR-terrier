	<brief_summary>There need understand long anesthetic drug last brain surgery ascend aorta aortic arch . Drugs prolong effect blood temperature make cold therefore influence temperature need study . This type surgery allow u answer question anesthetic drug behave give routine portion surgery . Patients provide anesthetic drug surgery heart lung machine . After drug inject heart lung machine deliver brain provide sleep pain relief . Immediately injection anesthetic drug , blood sample take exist intravenous line neck plasma drug concentration measure . This help u understand long drug last brain type surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Pharmacokinetics Opioids Sedative/Hypnotics During Selective Cerebral Perfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study understand disposition sufentanil , midazolam morphine drug introduce arterial circulation brain . Patients undergo surgery ascend aorta aortic arch often require cessation blood flow organ body , maintain degree blood flow brain . In order achieve organ protection circulatory arrest phase surgery , body cool core temperature 28Â°C . Various technique include deep hypothermic circulatory arrest , retrograde cerebral perfusion superior vena cava , partial bilateral antegrade selective cerebral perfusion propose mean protect brain ischemic injury surgery aortic arch . At institution selective cerebral perfusion find success major aortic surgery . This technique devise first employed DeBakey associate , protect brain aortic arch surgery bilateral carotid perfusion [ 1 ] . Selective cerebral perfusion require surgical construction placement Dacron graft onto right axillary artery connect cardiopulmonary bypass machine provide 10 ml/kg/min antegrade flow brain perfusion [ 2 ] . Cerebral cool also decrease oxygen demand brain . In way brain ischemia may minimize . The nature major aortic arch surgery require independent cerebral circulation selective cerebral perfusion finite period time . The cardiopulmonary bypass machine allow perfuse brain indirectly serial flow right axillary artery innominate artery finally right carotid artery . Any anesthetic drug introduce cardiopulmonary bypass circuit deliver way . We take advantage independent circuit safely deliver anesthetic drug brain via right carotid artery surgery . A prior study enrol 6 patient show anesthetic administration safe feasible . Patients problem related anesthesia surgery . All patient leave hospital stable condition .</detailed_description>
