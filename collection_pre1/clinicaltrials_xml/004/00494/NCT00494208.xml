	<brief_summary>TDSM study physiology testosterone woman age 21-60 surgical menopause ( uterus ovary remove ) . Testosterone commonly think `` male hormone '' thus male 's primary hormone . Women produce testosterone much small amount despite , testosterone still play significant role . Fifty percent woman 's testosterone make adrenal gland ( gland sit top kidney ) fifty percent make ovary . When woman ovaries remove thought testosterone level decrease rapidly significantly . This study examine testosterone 's role sexual function , general well , muscle performance , cognitive function , carbohydrate metabolism muscle fat distribution . The study 14 month long weekly monthly visit . The subject place estrogen patch duration study . They also give weekly injection testosterone placebo 6 month . During testosterone treatment phase woman separate 5 group . The group include dose testosterone low , low , medium , high placebo . A placebo look feel similar testosterone ; however testosterone . We use test subject response testosterone think receive testosterone . Neither subject investigator know dose end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TDSM- Testosterone Dose Response Surgically Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In healthy woman primary hormone produce ovary estrogens progesterone , also produce testosterone menopause . Although normal blood level testosterone woman much low men , testosterone think important physiologic effect woman , particularly muscle function , body composition , sexual function cognitive function . When woman require bilateral oophorectomy ( removal ovary ) , subsequently significant drop serum testosterone level . They also frequently experience decrease sense well , decrease sexual function . While treatment testosterone androgens widely promote woman low serum level , little available data effect treatment particularly give physiologic dos ( dos result normal blood level woman ) . Studies demonstrate benefit testosterone woman often used dos testosterone result high normal serum testosterone level . At dos , testosterone androgen produce virilize side effect increase facial body hair , acne , increase size clitoris change voice . It know whether physiologic testosterone replacement provide benefit see high dos woman androgen deficiency without limit , virilize side effect . It assume testosterone dose-response relationship different woman men , clinically significant effect psycho-sexual function , body composition , muscle performance , cognitive function , health-related outcome achieve testosterone dos concentration substantially low require produce similar effect men ; however , assumption test rigorously . Therefore , primary objective study establish testosterone dose-response relationship surgically menopausal woman low testosterone concentration range androgen-dependent outcome , include sexual function , fat-free mass , thigh muscle strength leg power , several domain neurocognitive function , plasma lipid , apolipoproteins lipoprotein particle , insulin sensitivity . The secondary objective determine range testosterone dose subsequent plasma testosterone concentration associate improvement sexual , physical neurocognitive function safely administer woman without significant adverse effect hair growth , voice , sebum production , clitoral size , cardiovascular risk factor . Hypotheses 1 . Testosterone administration surgically menopausal woman low testosterone concentration associate dose- concentration-dependent improvement sexual function sexual activity score , specific domain cognitive function , fat-free mass , thigh muscle strength , leg power . 2 . Testosterone dose-response relationship different different androgen dependent process . While domain sexual function normalize testosterone concentration upper end normal range healthy , young woman , significant gain fat-free mass , thigh muscle strength power would require high testosterone dos require induce change sexual function .</detailed_description>

The woman stable regimen transdermal estrogen replacement least three month . Those estrogen replacement take different mode estrogen replacement include willing switch transdermal estradiol patch ( see ) . A normal PAP smear ( subject cervix ) mammogram precede 12 month . Significant depression , assess Beck 's Depression Scale . Any acute chronic illness , malignant disease fever know unknown origin exclude . Poorly control diabetes mellitus ( hemoglobin A1c great 8.5 % ) Uncontrolled hypertension define blood pressure great 160/100 Severe obesity define body mass index great 40 kg/m2 Current recent ( last 6 month ) user illicit drug ( may affect appetite , food intake , metabolism , and/or compliance protocol ) Any one planning initiate weightreduction diet subsequent six month Alcohol drug dependence currently precede 6 month . Significant liver function abnormality , define SGOT , SGPT alkaline phosphatase value great three time upper limit normal Clinical Pathology Laboratory serum bilirubin level great 1.5 mg/dl exclude . History breast , ovarian , endometrial cervical cancer History hyperandrogenic disorder hirsutism , grade 2 3 acne , polycystic ovary disease . Testosterone administration patient may exacerbate underlying disorder . Intolerance transdermal formulation Women abnormal PAP smear mammograms include unless evaluate gynecologist breast uterine/cervical cancer exclude appropriate test . Women dementia assess minimental state examination Women depression , assess Beck 's Depression Scale . Those disability would prevent participate strength testing ( e.g. , amputation limb , blindness , severe arthritis , neurologic disorder Parkinson 's disease , stroke , myopathy ) . Women heart disease , include angina , congestive heart failure , history myocardial infarction coronary artery angioplasty bypass surgery previous year exclude . Subjects plan initiate weightreduction diet subsequent six month Other Medications . Women receive precede three month drug know affect testosterone production metabolism ketoconazole , Megace , and/or anabolic/androgenic steroid exclude . We also exclude woman take take past three month medication include sexual dysfunction ( e.g. , spironolactone , SSRIs , GnRH agonists ) . Women use medication , device dietary supplement know enhance sexual function include . Women receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy may participate study stable replacement dose Lthyroxine least three month . Intolerance estrogen product skin patch Undiagnosed vaginal vulvar bleed History deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , thromboembolic disorder</criteria>
