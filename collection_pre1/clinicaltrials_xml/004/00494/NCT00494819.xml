	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) among common impair neuropsychiatric disorder worldwide among child adolescent prevalence DSM-IV ADHD range 5-10 % Western country ( Faraone et al. , 2003 ) 7.5 % Taiwan ( Gau et al. , 2005 ) ratio boys girl 3-8:1 . The significance ADHD clinical practice research high prevalence also impairments brings neurocognitive function , academic performance , social adjustment . The DSM-IV ADHD comprise three subtypes , predominantly Inattentive ( ADHD-I ) , predominantly Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ( ADHD-H ) , Combined subtype ( ADHD-C ) . The DSM-IV field trial indicate current subtypes differ significantly variable age onset , gender ratio , level social academic impairment ( Lahey et al. , 1994 ) . Although previous research suggest neuropsychological deficit ADHD associate frontal-subcortical region ( Castellanos , 1997 ) , study address whether DSM-IV subtypes differ neuropsychologically inconsistent result ( Nigg et al , 2002 ) . Many study demonstrate efficacy stimulant treat ADHD . Among , methylphenidate ( MPH ) widely use rigorously study ( eg . Spencer et al. , 2005 ; Stein et al. , 2005 ; Wilens et al. , 2005 ) . MPH also stimulant medication treatment ADHD Taiwan ; prove reduce significantly symptom ADHD , increase self regulation , learn motivation , academic performance , interpersonal ability . Meanwhile , efficacy also observe significant improvement neuropsychological functioning ( e.g. , Konrad et al. , 2004 ) . Given conclusive find neuropsychological function among ADHD subtypes little known neuropsychological deficit three ADHD subtypes Chinese population , present study aim validate ADHD diagnosis ADHD subtypes executive functioning measure . Although efficacy methylphenidate behavioral measure establish Taiwan , information neuropsychological measure . SPECIFIC AIMS : 1. validate ADHD subtype neuropsychological measure ; 2. investigate efficacy methylphenidate improvement executive functioning among child ADHD . HYPOTHESIS : We hypothesize ADHD ADHD subtype validate measure executive function methylphenidate decrease ADHD core symptom also improve executive function among child ADHD . METHOD Participants The sample consist 50 child psychiatric patient ADHD ( 20 ADHD-I , 20 ADHD-C 10 ADHD-H ) 50 normal control , age 7-10 . The inclusion criterion patient clinically diagnosis DSM-IV ADHD confirm K-SADS-E , age 7-10 , IQ &gt; 80 ; whose parent consent study . Participants exclude history brain injury epilepsy , visual/auditory deficit diagnose motor disorder , obsessive-compulsive disorder , mental retardation , depression . In order recruit population pure ADHD ( without psychiatric comorbidities ) , child comorbid oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD ) conduct disorder ( CD ) exclude , though concurrence ODD/CD ADHD high . Normal control recruited local elementary school geographical area . Measurements Considering age group select symptom ADHD , select measurement carefully ensure participant able complete every task without get fatigue distractive task . 1 . Chinese version Kiddie-Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia- epidemiology version ( K-SADS-E ) Development Chinese K-SADS-E carry Child Psychiatry Research Group Taiwan , include two-stage translation modification several item psycholinguistic equivalent relevant Taiwanese culture . The K-SADS-E widely use variety study mental illness child adolescent Taiwan ( Gau et al. , 2005 ) . Mother interview independently two separate interviewer make child 's psychiatric diagnosis . 2 . Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children Short Form ( WISC-III short form ) WISC-III ( Wechsler , 1991 ) well establish scale design ass Full-Scale IQ ( FSIQ ) child age 16 . It include 13 subtests test child 's cognitive ability different dimension . Test result represent Verbal IQ , Performance IQ , Full-Scale IQ . The present research conduct quad combination WISC short form include subtests Symbol Search , Arithmetic , Block Design , Verbal . Previous research suggest mentioned combination good reliability ( rxx = .91 ) validity ( rxx = .90 ) ( Silverstein , 1982 ) , preferred conduct research estimate FSIQ . 3 . Neuropsychological measure Five neuropsychological measure consist 19 task variable use . Cancellation Test ( Rudel et al. , 1978 ) Cancellation Test two-part paper-and-pencil measure visual scanning . Number Cancellation require subject strike three-digit target ( 257 ) intermittently place large array number ; Shape Cancellation require subject strike target shape ( star ) intermittently place file shape . The total number commission error , correct hit , complete time two separate test record . Completion time divide number calculate one index . Digit Span The assessor first require subject repeat orally present digit string ( Digit Forward ) recall digit backwards sequence ( Digit Backward ) . This task represent index sensory selection capacity/focus component , present research . Trail Making Test ( TMT ; Reitan &amp; Wolfson , 1986 ) A brief paper-and-pencil test involve numeric sequencing ( Trail A ) follow alpha-numeric sequencing ( Trail B ) original form . The Trail B modify use Chinese phonic symbol substitute English alphabet apply Chinese participant . Completed time off-target error task orient attentional component sensory selection , response selection , capacity/focus . Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ; Conners , 1995 ) The CPT require tabbing space key character X show screen . There six set total , 20 character within set . The Inter-Stimulus Intervals ( ISIs ) 1 , 2 , 4 second , different ISIs vary set . Each character maintain screen 250 m . Correct hit , omission error , commission error , reaction time collect index response selection capacity/focus . The ' value know discriminate factor one index sustain attention . Circle Tracing Test ( CTT , Bachorowski &amp; Newman , 1985 ) This task require subject trace large print circle ( 20 inch diameter ) index finger measure inhibition ongoing response ( eg . Geurts et al , 2004 ; Scheres et al. , 2003 ) . The word START ( green ink ) print right side line word STOP ( red ink ) print left side . The task administer two condition : first neutral instruction ( 'trace circle ' ) follow inhibition instruction ( 'trace circle , slow time ' ) within 12 minute without subject 's knowledge . The dependent variable task include time 1 neutral instruction , time 2 inhibition instruction , time discrepancy refer time 2 minus time 1 , three-point ( 0-2 ) degree deviation score assess trained observer . The large time discrepancy , good participant able inhibit ( slow ) continuous trace response . 4 . Measures behavior symptom Subjects ' parent complete SNAP-IV train rater observe subject ' behavior rate two behavioral scale task . Swanson , Nolan , Pelham IV scale ( SNAP-IV , Swanson et al. , 2001 ) The SNAP-IV 26-item rating scale consist DSM-IV symptom Inattention ( Item 1-9 ) Hyperactivity/Impulsivity domain ( Item 10-18 ) criterion ADHD , oppositional symptom ( Item 19-26 ) criterion ODD . Several study use different version SNAP , either parent teacher form , outcome measure ass efficacy treatment ADHD ( e.g. , Steele et al. , 2006 ) . Regarding psychometric property SNAP rating scale , Chinese version SNAP-IV show satisfactory test-retest reliability ( intraclass correlation= 0.59~0.72 ) , internal consistency ( alpha=0.88~0.90 ) , concurrent validity ( Pearson correlation = 0.56~0.72 ) , discriminant validity ( Liu et al. , 2006 ) . Clinical Global Impression ( CGI , NIMH , 1976 ) CGI , three-item scale include Severity Illness , Global Improvement , Efficacy Index , use assess treatment response psychiatric patient . The Severity Illness 7-point scale ( 1 = normal 7 = extremely ill ) use study . Behavior Observation Ratings This four-point ( 0 = 3 = extremely much ) rating scale three item assess child 's behavior task . The three target behavior observe `` unsteady remain seat , '' `` murmur task , '' `` give easily '' one dose methylphenidate . Procedure We obtain write informed consent subject child parent . The day prior date receive neuropsychological task , child ask halt medication order obtain test result baseline data make comparison performance treatment MPH . The testing procedure follow : ( 1 ) All child ( ADHD group normal control ) assess IQ series neuropsychological assessment . Their parent complete SNAP-IV scale time . ( 2 ) After , child ADHD take IR MPH ( dose prescription ) rest approximately 45 minute . Meanwhile , parent child ADHD interview K-SADS-E train interviewer . ( 3 ) Children ADHD re-assessed CPT . CGI Behavior observation assess . ANTICIPATED RESULT We anticipate child ADHD non-ADHD group perform differently neuropsychological test deficit neuropsychological function ADHD group . Also , expect methylphenidate improve performance neuropsychological test reduce behavioral symptom ADHD child . Subtypes difference neuropsychological function also expect . CONCLUSION The present research aim inspect effect methylphenidate behavioral measure neuropsychological function among child ADHD Taiwan . Understanding treatment effect among neuropsychological function different behavior may help u clear psychopathology ADHD . Learning possible difference among subtypes regard relationship treatment self-report outcome benefit matter well .</detailed_description>
