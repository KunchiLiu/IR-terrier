	<detailed_description>3.0 Research Design Methods This pilot experimental study design randomize , education control clinical trial mindfulness meditation CLBP . A sample 80 old adult 65 year age older recruit chronic pain clinic , general medicine research registry , post flyer , newspaper advertisement 18-month period . Eligibility determine self-report checklist review potential participant phone . Pre-intervention study participant consent study measure obtain . After consent baseline measure , participant randomize use simple randomization process stratification use software generate randomization plan . After randomization , participant intervention group receive intervention eight weekly 90-minute mindfulness meditation session . Controls receive 8-week health education program . Subject evaluation program occur University Pittsburgh Center Research Health Care ( CRHC ) subject examination area well classroom nearby parking structure . Subjects assess weekly telephone intervention health education program subset measure administer baseline . Immediately post-intervention education program complete set measure administer participant control . Subjects assess monthly telephone five month completion MBSR health education program subset baseline measure . Six month intervention complete , participant ask return CRHC complete entire set measure third time mindfulness meditation intervention group continue home quantify . 3.2 Procedures 3.2.2 Entry Phase : All 40 subject include base upon screen criterion receive identical pre-treatment baseline assessment . Data collect interviewer-administered trained research assistant University Pittsburgh CRHC . After successful telephone screening , write informed consent , baseline examination , eligible research subject enter study randomize one two treatment group ; 1 ) education group ( control ) 2 ) mindfulness meditation ( treatment ) . The randomization process perform use statistical software random-number generator generate randomization list study commences . 3.2.4 Intervention Phase : Participants see group format week 90 minute 8-weeks . All session lead facilitator experience teaching MBSR program undergone teacher train least one intensive ( ≥ 50 hour ) MBSR teacher train program conduct University Massachusetts Medical School Center Mindfulness prior intervention . All session occur University Pittsburgh Center Research Health Care ( CRHC ) . MBSR Intervention : The intervention base work Jon Kabat-Zinn Massachusetts Medical Center . He adapt Eastern method mindfulness meditation Western audience . Three technique mindfulness meditation taught .

Therefore , structure session one hour ( total ) meditation 30 minute discussion . Health Education Control Program : A convince comparison group essential subject recruitment retention well essential control key component MBSR program . Therefore , create comparison group control time , group size facilitator time . We base 8-week health education program successful age curriculum use trial ( 80 , 81 ) . The health education curriculum involve lecture , group interaction homework assignment base health topic discuss . Sessions include topic ( ) medication , ( b ) foot care , ( c ) traveling , ( ) nutrition . Additionally , subject give material promote participation retention program . For example , participant receive `` passport '' health , available Pennsylvania Department Aging . It small booklet senior fill essential health information medical problem medication . Filling passport one homework assignment . The health education group receive ongoing staff attention . This person coordinate present class . The consistent presence class coordinator control facilitator contact MBSR program . This type intervention deem scientifically `` inert '' ( i.e. , affect outcome interest trial ) . Previous trial LIFE-P trial demonstrate excellent retention rate 91.5 % ( 82 ) . 3.3 Data Collection Statistical Considerations 3.3.1 Outcome measure : Outcome measure choose reflect primary aim determine impact MBSR program physical function pain . To reflect secondary aim determine impact MBSR program multidimensional aspect chronic pain , comprehensive psychosocial , sleep appetite measure decide . Outcome measure also choose demonstrated feasibility , reliability , validity old adult chronic pain . Questionnaires administer baseline , completion 8-week program , 6-month follow include 1 ) measure physical ability SF-36 Physical Function Scale ( 49 ) , Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( 51 ) , Short Physical Performance Battery ( 52 , 53 ) ; 2 ) measure pain McGill Pain Questionnaire ( MPQ ) , Short Form ( 54 ) The Pain Thermometer ( 51 ) ; 3 ) measure psychosocial function SF-36 Health Survey ( 55 ) , Geriatric Depression Scale ( 57 ) , Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire ( 58 ) , Multidimensional Pain Inventory ( 60 ) , Catastrophizing Scale Cognitive Strategies Questionnaire ( 61 ) , Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire ( 62 ) , Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale ( 65 ) , Self-rated heath ( SRH ) use standardize method ( 66 , 67 ) ; 4 ) measure mindfulness Kentucky Inventory Mindfulness Skills ( 68 ) Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ( MAAS ) ( 69 , 70 ) ; 5 ) measure stress well-validated Perceived Stress Scale ( 71 ) ; 6 ) measure sleep modify Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( 73 ) ; 7 ) measure appetite evaluate pain-related appetite impairment . 3.3.2 Evaluation Treatment Outcome : Weekly Assessments : To examine process change , brief ( 15 minute ) weekly telephone evaluation major important domain ( pain , physical function , psychosocial function , sleep ) conduct . The measure subset collected baseline measure ( see D.3.3.1 ) . These data allow detailed examination temporal association individual week 8-week MBSR program primary outcome pain physical function well secondary outcome psychosocial function . It also allow detailed examination temporal relationship time frequency meditate primary secondary outcome . All measure collect weekly telephone one-two day treatment session . These measure collect research assistant blind randomization assignment . These weekly dependent measure include assessment pain , physical function , psychosocial function sleep 1 ) SF-36 Physical Function scale , 2 ) self-reported pain past week scale 0-100 , 3 ) short-form Multidimensional Pain Inventory , 4 ) subject ' report pain medication usage ( include OTC ) previous week ( type , dosage , frequency ) , tracked diary , 5 ) five item MAAS , 6 ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ; 7 ) Acute Illness/injury exacerbation comorbidity assess yes/no question answer positively , participant ask describe event .
