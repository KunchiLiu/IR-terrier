	<brief_summary>The aim study : 1 ) identify gene play role human pubertal development reproduction , 2 ) characterize phenotypic spectrum patient gene defect , 3 ) discern mode inheritance disorder cause gene defect . We specifically interested gene cause Kallmann syndrome , idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( IHH ) , precocious ( early ) puberty , delay puberty . Individuals travel Boston participate study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Genetic Causes Kallmann Syndrome Reproductive Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview : Our work divide two main area investigation : 1. discovery new , yet-undiscovered gene condition early ( i.e . precocious ) puberty , delay puberty , absence pubertal development ( i.e . Kallmann syndrome ) well normal puberty accompany alter reproductive system later life ( i.e . hypothalamic amenorrhea woman low testosterone level men ) . Identification new gene require either single large family collection small family . 2. detailed examination gene already implicate cause condition . There several important aspect program : - This analysis detect DNA abnormalities DNA segment screen . The turnaround time process sample approximately 6-9 month . We must receive signed consent form order begin analysis blood sample . - Our laboratory locate Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston MA largely fund National Institutes Health . We research laboratory CLIA certify clinical laboratory . - Even patient member his/her family affect one condition mention , obtain blood sample family member , include parent sibling often important work . - It every individual 's responsibility notify research team he/she would like obtain research result . The patient must sign second consent form receive information . Study Procedures Risks - You ask give approximately 3-5 tablespoon blood research project . There risk bruise small amount bleed associate blood draw . - You ask fill medical history checklist , indicate presence absence clinical feature may associate abnormality pubertal development . - Since absence puberty sometimes associate limited smell ability , may ask try identify odor scratch sniff test . This take 15 minute . - Your family history give u clue determine condition inherit . Therefore , detailed family history , least back grandparent obtain researcher . Benefits : There direct benefit participation study . Some gene condition know , gene yet discover . If study discovers gene responsible , help understand disorder . It possible genetic cause reproductive disorder may learn . This information share request . When contact u , please include message description diagnosis , pubertal history ( age hit pubertal hallmark , e.g. , growth spurt ; body hair ; voice deepen genital growth men ; menstruation breast development woman ) reproductive history .</detailed_description>
