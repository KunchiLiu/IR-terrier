	<brief_title>Sorafenib Plus Carboplatin Paclitaxel Head Neck Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Sorafenib drug design block function important protein cancer cell . These protein , active , part responsible abnormal growth behavior cancer cell . Carboplatin paclitaxel design work stop division cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin receive sorafenib , carboplatin , paclitaxel . On Day 1 , paclitaxel give needle vein 3 hour , follow carboplatin vein 30 minute . On Days 2-19 , take sorafenib mouth stomach tube . You take 2 tablet sorafenib morning , even . Sorafenib take 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water empty stomach ( either 1 hour meal 2 hour meal ) . Sorafenib must swallow whole without chew prepared use instruction provide patient handout prepare sorafenib liquid . If miss dose , skip take next schedule dose schedule time . Every 21 day call study `` cycle '' . You may give medication receive study drug decrease risk nausea allergic reaction . Study Visits : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycle 1 follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw check see well blood clot . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot . Every week first 6 week study treatment , measure record blood pressure . The study staff explain measure blood pressure . The study doctor research nurse review log clinic visit . On Day 1 every odd cycle ( Cycles 3 5 ) , chest x-ray CT MRI scan check status disease . If doctor think need , also bone scan . Length Study : You may receive 6 cycle treatment 3 study drug . However , may continue receive sorafenib long benefit . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Study Visits Sorafenib Treatment Only : If continue receive sorafenib finish 6 cycle treatment 3 study drug , take sorafenib every day . You study visit every 8 week . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( around 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot . - You chest x-ray CT MRI scan check status disease every 2 cycle . End-of-Study Visit : At end study treatment , follow test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam . - Blood ( around 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot . - You performance status evaluation . - You chest x-ray CT MRI scan check status disease . - You also ECG . This investigational study . Sorafenib FDA approve treatment advance renal cell cancer . Its use study , disease , investigational . Carboplatin paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
