	<brief_title>Vacuum Assisted Wound Closure ( VAWC ) Mesh Mediated Fascial Traction - Prospective Study Novel Technique Open Abdomen Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open abdomen treatment often result difficulty close abdomen . Highest closure rate see vacuum assist wound closure ( VAWC ) technique . Failures technique occasionally experience , especially case severe visceral swell needing longer treatment period open abdomen . A novel combination vacuum assist wound closure mesh mediate fascial traction manage open abdomen therefore develop initially test small pilot-like study encouraging result late primary closure abdomen seven patient . In multicenter study prospectively evaluate technique . Inclusion criterion : All patient treat open abdomen 4 participate hospital register , patient commence therapy VAWC mesh mediate fascial traction include study intention treat model . Exclusion criterion : Treatment open abdomen technique . Method : - The first period 2-5 day abdominal VAWC dressing apply . - On day 3-10 polypropylene mesh suture fascial edge , two layer VAWC system , tighten . - The VAWC dress change mesh tighten every 2-3 day , result gradual approximation fascial edge . - Finally mesh remove fascia close . - At closure wound suture length register . Primary endpoint : Frequency primary fascial closure . Secondary endpoint : - study factor associate failure fascial closure in-hospital mortality , - abdominal pressure variation attributable use technique , - duration treatment open abdomen , - frequency incisional hernia one five year . Duration study : 3-5 year . Enrollment open abdomen case . Follow-up schedule patient : - Clinical evaluation 1 5 year . - CT-examination 1 year .</detailed_description>
