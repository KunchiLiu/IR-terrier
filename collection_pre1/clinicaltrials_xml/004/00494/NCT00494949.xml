	<brief_title>Increasing Dose Safety Study Hemospan Orthopedic Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic ( donor ) blood transfusion often require and/or orthopedic hip surgery maintain adequate hemoglobin concentration , prevent tissue ischemia , treat hypotension , compensate fluid shift . For example , hospitalization hip replacement , patient may receive two three unit blood . This amount vary depend technical difficulty surgery , patient 's hemoglobin concentration prior surgery , patient 's clinical status . The limited availability , logistic constraint document risk associate allogeneic blood transfusion prompt search alternative therapy . Autologous ( self-donated ) red blood cell pre-donation use many case age , anemia co-morbidities often preclude use treatment . Cell save re-infusion also prevent blood transfusion , practice also potential problem limited applicability . Over past 75 year various `` blood substitute '' develop potential clinical use . To date show significant toxicity preclinical clinical study regulatory approval synthetic hemoglobin-based product impede safety concern . Hemospan novel polyethylene-modified hemoglobin solution specifically develop perfuse oxygenate tissue risk ischemia hypoxia . As result molecular size oxygen dissociation characteristic , Hemospan selectively off-loads oxygen tissue predispose low oxygen tension . In preclinical study Hemospan find free significant toxicity variety animal specie dose exceed use study . In Phase I safety study normal volunteer , Hemospan well tolerate dos 100 mg/kg ( approximately 200 mL 4g/dL Hemospan solution ) .</detailed_description>
