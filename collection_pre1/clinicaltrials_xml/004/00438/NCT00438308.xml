	<brief_title>Comparison Early Late Therapy Adults With Operatively Treated Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last three decade , operative treatment distal radius fracture become increasingly common compare non-operative treatment . Over last 15 year trend towards invasive , internal plate fixation fracture distal radius . One argument favor internal fixation fracture , similar periarticular fracture , would beneficial allow early movement wrist articulation . There , however , data support statement . In fact , data regard external fixation either immobilizes wrist allows wrist motion suggest early wrist mobilization important overall alignment bone term final wrist motion . This question important patient care decision-making regarding fracture . Additionally , many company use claim marketing point spite lack evidence . We consider good quality data need determine answer issue help resolve relate problem describe .</detailed_description>
