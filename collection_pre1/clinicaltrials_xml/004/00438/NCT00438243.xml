	<brief_summary>This research do look effect Bromfenac , also call Xibrom treatment swell retina ( light sensitive tissue back eye ) call `` macular edema '' occur cataract surgery . Swelling retina lead blurry vision . The commonly use treatment eyedrops decrease inflammation may help stop swell . The investigator want see drug Bromfenac ( Xibrom ) decrease swell retina cataract surgery improve vision patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Effect Topical Bromfenac Ophthalmic Solution 0.09 % Patients With Acute Post-operative Cystoid Macular Edema .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 2.5 million cataract surgery perform yearly United States . Despite advance cataract surgery , cystoid macular edema ( CME ) common cause loss vision cataract surgery , occur approximately 0.3 % 3 % uncomplicated surgery . If surgery complicate , CME occur 20 % patient . In CME , fluid accumulates cystic space within out plexiform layer retina , result decrease vision . Ocular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) widely use treatment CME . NSAIDs decrease inflammation hypothesize decrease production prostaglandins via selective inhibition cyclooxygenase pathway , result CME . The standard care management postoperative pseudophakic macular edema extent remain unclear . There currently FDA-approved therapy prophylaxis treatment postoperative cystoid macular edema . Bromfenac ( Xibrom ) NSAID FDA-approved ocular use treat pain inflammation ocular surgery . Therefore , medication might decrease inflammation effective treating CME . The investigator plan conduct control study investigate effect Bromfenac ( Xibrom ) patient develop CME cataract surgery . The result study may important good understanding pathogenesis treatment acute postoperative cystoid macular edema prevent chronic vision loss .</detailed_description>

Agree 14 day washout period prior enrollment currently use disallow medication . History known hypersensitivity bromfenac , component test agent and/or `` procedural '' medication ( anesthetic , dilate drop , fluorescein , etc ) History preexist macular disease confound and/or precludes evaluation cystoid macular edema ( include limit macular hole , epiretinal membrane pseudohole , diabetic macular edema , neovascular agerelated macular degeneration , acute posterior uveitis ) CME due etiology vein occlusion Use topical ophthalmic prostaglandin analog within 14 day prior enrollment , i.e. , subject agree 14 day washout period prior enrollment .</criteria>
