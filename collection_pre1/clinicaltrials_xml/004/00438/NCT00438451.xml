	<brief_title>Study Treatment Elderly Patients With Older Newer Antiepileptic Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indication : Focal Epilepsy Objectives : To evaluate tolerability efficacy levetiracetam ( LEV ) newly diagnose elderly patient ( age 60 yr ) focal epilepsy compare lamotrigine ( LTG ) carbamazepine slow release ( CBZ ) . Primary Outcome : The primary outcome 58-week retention rate measure number drop out due adverse event seizures day 1 treatment . Secondary Outcome : Proportion patient remain seizure-free week 30 ( Visit 4 ) ; proportion patient remain seizure free week 58 ( Visit 6 ) ; time ( day ) first break-through seizure ( day 1 treatment ) ; absolute seizure frequency maintenance ( 52 week ) phase ; proportion seizure-free day maintenance phase subject enter maintenance phase ; frequency adverse event ( day 1 treatment ) ; QOLIE-31 result V6 ; Portland Neurotoxicity scale V6 ; result cognitive test ( EpiTrack© UCB ) . Trial Design : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter Phase IV study use parallel group design three treatment group . The study consist 6-week titration-phase 52-week maintenance phase . Patients successfully complete trial ( final visit , V6 ) unblinded offer either continue current drug change alternative antiepileptic drug ( AED ) treatment choice . Population : Patients age 60 year new onset focal epilepsy i.e . either least one epileptic seizure last 6 month focal epileptiform discharge EEG relevant lesion CT/MRI total 2 epileptic seizure , one occur last 6 month prior inclusion . Patients acute ( &lt; 2 week ) symptomatic epileptic seizure due acute brain abnormality ( i.e . haemorrhage cerebral infarct ) , contraindication drug trial exclude . Sample Size : 360 patient include , 120 patient per treatment arm . Investigational Medicinal Product ( ) : Levetiracetam , lamotrigine , carbamazepine-slow release Trial Duration Dates : Duration treatment : 6 week titration phase , 52 week maintenance phase . Follow : At end trial subject unblinded may choose continue medication taper trial medication treat alternative drug investigator discretion . The patient receive dosing schedule referral letter his/her physician . Duration trial : approximately 2 year . Start recruitment : January 2007 Projected number centre : 75 Number country : 3 ( Germany , Switzerland , Austria ) .</detailed_description>
