	<brief_summary>The purpose study find best sensitive screening modality ( CT , MRI , EUS ) small pre-cancerous pancreatic lesion treat small lesion turn cancer . Another purpose study search common marker DNA would increase chance someone develop pancreatic cancer , locate protein pancreatic juice indicate tumor development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Pancreas Screening Study ( CAPS 3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer ( PC ) 4th lead cause cancer death U.S. Because seldom diagnose early curable stage , nearly patient die disease . Early detection PC precursor save life . In multi-center , translational prospective control cohort study , propose screen high-risk individual ( member familial pancreatic cancer kindred and/or germline mutation BRCA-2 , p16 , STK-11 ) , use EUS , CT , MRI test panel candidate biomarkers . Patients suspect neoplasms offer surgery resect pancreata examine expert pathologist . Pathological result compare radiologic finding biomarker result . Our study hypothesis screen test detect early curable non-invasive pancreatic neoplasia high risk individual progress invasive cancer . The primary specific aim study determine frequency detectable pancreatic neoplasia individual inherit predisposition pancreatic cancer . Our additional specific aim : 1 ) To test value newly-developed method ( PANCPRO ) calculate risk family develop PC best target might benefit screening ; 2a ) . To compare performance characteristic reliability pancreatic imaging test EUS , CT , MRI/MRCP detection early pancreatic neoplasia ; 2b ) To determine prevalence abdominal pelvic tumor CT MRI individual carry germ-line BRCA2 gene mutation patient Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ; 2c ) To correlate radiologic abnormality histologic finding resect pancreata ; 3 ) . To validate panel candidate DNA protein marker ( CA19-9 , macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 ( MIC-1 ) , DNA hypermethylation , KRAS gene mutation ) pancreatic juice serum indicator prevalent neoplasms high risk individual , compare concurrently enrol control .</detailed_description>
