	<brief_title>The Feasibility Physical Activity Advanced Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information Cancer one lead cause mortality morbidity worldwide [ 1 ] . The resultant morbidity cancer treatment manifold ; common physiologic symptom include pain , muscle weakness fatigue , whereas common psychological symptom include depression , anxiety poor sense well-being . As method cancer detection treatment improve , survival prolong lifetime burden adverse effect increase [ 2 ] . Addressing issue critical towards maximize quality life , multidimensional construct encompass physical psychosocial factor [ 3 ] . Physical activity one potential strategy ameliorate quality life phase cancer treatment [ 4 ] . Increasing evidence indicate role physical activity improve several aspect physical psychological well-being may contribute quality life cancer patient , include muscle strength , functional capacity , mood self-esteem [ 5 ] . Not physical activity prove benefit term physical performance fatigue cancer survivor , may improve capacity basic activity daily live functional independence maintain long possible [ 6 ] . Although demonstrate early stage cancer survivor , limited evidence use physical activity palliation patient actively progressive , advanced incurable cancer [ 7 ] . A study exercise advanced metastatic cancer patient demonstrate benefit quality life outcome , however small sample size limited generalizability large end-stage cancer population [ 8-12 ] . There exist critical need specifically identify exercise programmes target advanced cancer patient ' need , interest preference [ 13 ] . Purpose The purpose pilot study explore physical activity preference interest actively progressive , advanced incurable cancer patient determine association physical activity quality life population . The ultimate aim study provide preliminary data subsequent intervention trial base encouraging result obtain . Objectives 1 . To describe advanced cancer patient 's attitude towards physical activity , self-efficacy physical activity programming preference . 2 . To examine relationship quality life , medical demographic variable , physical activity advance cancer patient . 3 . To identify advanced cancer population would willing able participate physical activity intervention . Study Design This pilot study cross-sectional design , use survey questionnaire combine close open-ended question . After write consent obtain , investigator administer survey questionnaire via face-to-face interview patient time location mutually convenient party . The survey questionnaire one-time assessment , anticipate duration 45 minute completion . The survey questionnaire develop base combination validate physical activity quality life questionnaire , include McGill Quality Life Questionnaire [ 14 ] , Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale [ 15 ] , Late-Life Function Disability Instrument [ 16 ] . Exercise program preference Theory Planned Behavior construct assess use item take previous research assess physical activity cancer survivor [ 17-19 ] . Medical demographic information collect use self-report measure via medical chart review . Date death determine cancer registry . Inclusion Criteria 1 . 18 year age old 2 . Be able understand , provide write informed consent , speak English 3 . Cognitive ability participate ( define normal Folstein 's Mini Mental Status Score patient 's age education level [ 20 ] ) 4 . Diagnosis advance cancer ( define progressive , incurable , locally recurrent metastatic disease ) 5 . Approval treat physician Exclusion Criteria 1 . Any absolute contraindication exercise ( include acute MI within 2 day , symptomatic/severe aortic stenosis , decompensated heart failure , symptomatic/hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmia , unstable angina previously stabilize medical therapy , acute aortic dissection , acute myocarditis/pericarditis , acute pulmonary embolus/infarction ) 2 . Palliative Performance Status level 30 % less [ 21 ] 3 . Any patient , opinion treat physician , within last day hour life Recruitment Patients diagnose advanced cancer ( define progressive , incurable , locally recurrent metastatic disease ) recruit Cross Cancer Institute Capital Health Regional Palliative Home Care Program . Eligible patient identify case manager Capital Health Regional Palliative Home Care Program , study information include ethics-approved Pain Symptom &amp; Palliative Care Research Group study brochure distribute outpatient Cross Cancer Institute research nurse study coordinator . Patient contact make telephone outside Cross Cancer Institute thereafter . Patients accept invitation participate provide write consent prior commence study . Statistical Analysis To detect change 0.5 standard deviation ( medium effect size ) various outcome ( quality life , physical activity ) power 80 % two-tailed alpha value &lt; 0.05 , need 29 participant . Based previous study sample Cross Cancer Institute Capital Health Regional Palliative Home Care Pain &amp; Symptom Palliative Care Research Group , 30 patient could expect recruited nine month period give frailty end-of-life symptom limitation . The study commence enrollment first subject , subsequent subject recruit ongoing basis . Initial analysis provide complete descriptive information demographic medical profile study participant . Primary analysis use multiple regression explore relationship demographic/medical characteristic , physical function quality life variable . Data Safety Monitoring Committee Ethical scientific approval obtain local Institutional Review Boards affiliate Cross Cancer Institute Capital Health Regional Palliative Home Care prior study commencement . All serious adverse event report local IRBs well participant 's treat physician . The project coordinator , supervision principal investigator , responsible report serious adverse event . The local IRBs oversee validity integrity data conduct periodic audit study record .</detailed_description>
