	<detailed_description>Subjects- 105 subject recruit participation study , thirty-five three hearing loss group . Subjects assign three group accord severity hearing loss . Group 1 ( mild ) subject exhibit normal slop moderately severe SNHL , Pure Tone Averages ( PTAs ) 500 , 1000 , 2000 Hz le 35 dB HL . Group 2 ( moderate ) consist subject mild slop moderately severe SNHL PTAs 35 50 dB HL . Group 3 ( severe ) subject exhibit moderately-severe , slop severe-profound SNHL , PTAs great 50 . All subject slop hearing loss define least 20 dB average difference 3000 Hz 500 Hz . ( Due subject drop-out , final data consist 32 subject mild group , 33 moderate group , 29 severe group ) Hearing status assess mean audiometric pure-tone speech recognition test group previous hearing aid user . Normal middle ear function verify mean immittance measure . All subject exhibit absence significant air-bone gap frequency ( &lt; 10 dB ) normal tympanograms define compensate static admittance 0.25 2.5 mmho measure positive tail tympanometric peak pressure -150 +100 daPa . All subject service-connected veteran eligible care amplification VA Audiology service . All subject previous wearer binaural hearing aid , minimum daily usage requirement 4 hours/day . All subject previous user output compression hear aid manufacturer . All subject participate approximately eight ten hour test course four visit . At first visit , subject receive hearing test , unaided speech understand noise measure , aid speech understand noise current hearing aid . Additionally , earmold impression obtain experimental hearing aid . At second visit , subject complete first set subjective measure unaided current ( ) hearing aid condition . Subjects fit digitally programmable user-selectable directional/omnidirectional hearing aid first two experimental setting ( randomly select directional/omnidirectional omnidirectional ) , use approximately one month return next test session . At third visit , subject complete entire test battery experimental hearing aid wear last month . The experimental hearing aid program condition ( directional/omnidirectional omnidirectional ) . At fourth final visit , subject complete entire test battery final hearing aid condition . Additionally , final visit , subject complete preference questionnaire . Speech understanding noise test : The Connected Sentence Test ( CST ) Hearing In Noise Test ( HINT ) administer subject . An investigator room subject score test . The investigator blind experimental setting hear aid control experimenter bias . The CST test speech intelligibility everyday speech present fixed SNR . The test consist 24 pair speech passage produce conversationally . The subject 's task repeat word test sentence . Each passage include 25 key word score correct incorrect . Subject score 1 pair passage average obtain intelligibility score experimental condition . Data Pearsons et al . indicate real-world SNRs relatively noisy environment range approximately +4 dB -1 dB . Consequently , test administer +3 dB SNR , represent relatively difficult real-world listen situation . This SNR chosen minimize floor ceiling effect subject group base previous investigation laboratory , give steep performance-intensity function report CST . The HINT administer second test sentence intelligibility noise . For investigation , two block ten sentence use condition . Listeners require repeat sentence speak male talker presence speech-shaped noise , present fix level 65 dBA . The level speech stimuli adjust adaptively Speech Reception Threshold ( SRT ) determine . The SRT define SNR necessary listener recognize speech material correctly 50 % time . Correct identification sentence base proper repetition word sentence , minor exception . These exception relate fact small substitution verb tense article `` '' `` '' allow without score sentence incorrect . Presentation level sentence adjust base subject ' response ( incorrect response raise level ; correct response lower level next sentence ) . The level vary 4 dB step first 5 trial , 2 dB step final 15 trial . Speech noise test environment : The arrangement speaker speech-in-noise test show figure 1 . Both speech-in-noise test administer conference room ( 5.05 X 4.71 X 2.60 meter ) moderate reverberation ( average reverberation time Rt60 : 482 m , measure octave frequency 250 4000 Hz , experimental condition 2 people room ) . Each subject seat center room eight-speaker configuration presentation speech noise stimulus . Speech present point-source loudspeaker ( Tannoy System 600 , fused-concentric driver ) 0ยบ azimuth . Uncorrelated noise deliver seven bipolar loudspeaker ( Definitive Technologies BP-2X ) space equally listener [ approximately 25 , 76 , 128 , 180 , 232 , 284 , 335 ] . The use bipolar loudspeaker allow diffuse source position comparison standard , front-firing loudspeaker . All speaker equidistant ( 1.5m ) subject 's head . Speech noise level control use Pentium IV class computer eight-channel level controller ( Ashly VCM-88 ) . Hearing aid fitting protocol : Hearing aid gain determine use National Acoustics Laboratory-Revised ( NAL-R ) prescriptive target verify use real-ear ( Fonix 6500 ) measurement . Hearing aid frequency-gain parameter adjust measured real ear aid response match target response closely possible octave frequency 500 4000 Hz omnidirectional directional mode . The match target report result . The processing strategy experimental hearing aid set output compression match subject 's previous hearing aid . Targets match 65 dB SPL composite noise input . A real ear saturation response obtain 90 dB SPL broadband input ensure high-level stimulus exceed listener discomfort level , hear aid output adjust accordingly . In order maintain double-blind experiment , hear aid programming , fitting , real ear measurement perform one investigator record hearing aid set ( omnidirectional directional ) visit . This investigator keep data subject complete aspect study . Furthermore , investigator program fit hearing aid involve data collection subject . Since subject previous user binaural amplification , brief orientation use experimental hearing aid sufficient . Subjects issued remote control volume control three program button . Program 1 set default setting ( directional omnidirectional ) . In order ensure subject safety , omnidirectional program include program two across condition ; however , subject instruct use program two situation necessary hear sound angle equally ( e.g . cross street traffic , etc. ) . Program three remote control set mute , subject could use first two program . Subjects give identical instruction setting ( omnidirectional directional ) investigator give instruction know set currently subject 's hearing aid . Subjects tell hearing aid likely work best noise could position signal interest front interfere noise behind . Subjects instruct cleaning , care , battery usage , volume control adjustment . Subjects ask wear experimental hearing aid much possible waking hour , minimally 6 hours/day . Subjects ask log daily hearing aid use log sheet provide verify meet 6 hour/day . Additionally , subject record much time day spend two program . Subjective measure : PHAB- The investigator administer subjective measure mask experimental setting hear aid . All subject complete Profile Hearing Aid Benefit ( PHAB ) questionnaire condition : unaided , previous aid , experimental directional , experimental omnidirectional . The PHAB 66-item inventory develop research usage generate measure hear aid benefit . Subjects complete 66 item unaided listening aid condition . The test instrument score base benefit provide aided versus unaided condition . SADL- All subject complete Satisfaction Amplification Daily Living ( SADL ) questionnaire three aided condition . The SADL design quantify satisfaction hearing aid . This scale consist 15 item four subscales : positive effect amplification , service cost , negative feature , personal image . Subjects respond question general opinion wear hearing aid . For current study , 3 question cost service omit , subject pay hear aid , wear experimental hearing aid one month complete survey . Preference questionnaire- At conclusion subject 's involvement study , he/she ask hearing aid prefer quiet noisy environment well she/he overall preference three hearing aid condition .</detailed_description>
