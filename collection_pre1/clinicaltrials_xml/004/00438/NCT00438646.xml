	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine feasibility establish method future study investigate association oral bacteria allergic disease child . Rates allergic disease asthma , hay fever , eczema increase U.S. past several decade . One explanation increase Hygiene Hypothesis , contend decrease microbial exposure make population reactive environmental allergen . Reports protective association various infection exposure farm , pet , sibling , day care provide support Hypothesis . Preliminary work NIEHS researcher suggest oral bacterial exposure may beneficial . NIEHS researcher recently report elevated serum antibody concentration two common oral pathogen associate low prevalence asthma , wheeze , hay fever U.S. population . Using mouse model , NIEHS researcher find immune response involve allergic airway inflammation could modulate infection oral pathogen . To investigate association human , NIEHS researcher , collaboration UNC researcher , plan observational study collect saliva sample allergy information child patient UNC-Chapel Hill School Dentistry . Because anticipate several hundred child might enrol , propose test method pilot study 60 child . Twenty child recruit three pediatric clinic . A research assistant obtain parent 's consent child 's assent administer questionnaire parent . The child 's dentist collect one teaspoon saliva child chew piece inert wax spit sterile collection cup . Samples transport NIEHS analyze bacterial specie allergy-related cytokine . The specific aim pilot study : 1 ) identify efficient recruitment strategy , 2 ) estimate response rate , 3 ) estimate distribution allergic diseases among child , 4 ) identify problematic consent form questionnaire item , 5 ) optimize saliva collection laboratory protocol , 6 ) estimate statistical parameter require precise sample size calculation . Information gain pilot study allow u decide whether large study among clinic population feasible design efficient study decide proceed .</detailed_description>
