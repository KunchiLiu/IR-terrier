	<brief_title>A Pilot Study To Evaluate Effectiveness Pulsed Time-Domain Optical Spectroscopy Monitoring Responses Neoadjuvant Treatments Locally-Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy female North America . Around 5-15 % estimate 200,000 new case diagnose year present locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) ( The definition constitute `` LABC '' complex variable . Clinically tumours usually consider great 5cm size and/or extend beyond breast tissue surround skin muscle . Patients mat axillary lymph node ( N2 ) internal mammary node ( N3 ) ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node involvement also consider LABC . In view extensive nature tumours presentation , woman LABC poor outcome term local systemic recurrence . Standard treatment patient usually neoadjuvant systemic ( chemotherapy less frequently endocrine therapy ) follow surgery radiotherapy . Patients hormone receptor positive tumour receive endocrine therapy . With use multidisciplinary therapy , 10-year disease free survival rate 50 % Stage IIIA 33 % Stage IIIB disease report . The impetus undertaking study search image method could potentially serve surrogate indicator pathological response . One modality wish investigate may ultimately useful patient population diffuse optical spectrometry . This modality depend differentiate oxygenate deoxygenated tissue also sensitive change tissue characteristic . It use proof-of-principle study differentiate benign malignant disease hypothesize may useful term monitor tumour response treatment . This non-invasive imaging modality easy administer relatively inexpensive .</detailed_description>
