	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well finasteride work treat patient stage II prostate cancer undergo surgery . Testosterone cause growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy use finasteride may fight prostate cancer lower amount testosterone body make . Giving finasteride surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finasteride Treating Patients With Stage II Prostate Cancer Who Are Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare frequency discriminate molecular marker expression Gleason grade ( GG ) 3 core , adjust Gleason score ( GS ) prostatectomy , patient stage II prostate cancer treat neoadjuvant finasteride v placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare frequency grade 3 grade 4 tumor occur patient . II . Determine frequency discriminate molecular signature expression tissue microarray core segregate GS prostatectomy patient . III . Compare GG 3-appearing area ( tumor rat GS 6 prostatectomy ) patient treat finasteride v placebo . IV . Compare GG 3-appearing area ( tumor rat GS 7 prostatectomy ) patient treat finasteride v placebo . V. Compare GG 4-appearing area ( tumor rat GS 7 prostatectomy ) patient treat finasteride v placebo . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord study site , Gleason score ( 6 vs 7 ) , type prostatectomy ( open v robotic/laparoscopic ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive finasteride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 4-6 week , undergo prostatectomy . Arm II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 4-6 week , undergo prostatectomy . Tumor tissue obtain prostatectomy use make tissue microarrays analyze immunohistochemistry molecular marker expression study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
