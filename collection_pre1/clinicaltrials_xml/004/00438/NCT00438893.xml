	<brief_title>Effects Long Term Dietary Portfolio Sequential Removal Food Components From Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We show 1-month metabolic study dietary portfolio , consist soy product , viscous fiber , almonds plant sterol form margarine , low cholesterol extent first generation statin ( cholesterol-lowering drug ) . However , long-term effectiveness dietary portfolio know . Furthermore , know extent food component contribute cholesterol reduction observe . We wish therefore evaluate long term effect dietary portfolio well effect remove single food component dietary portfolio cholesterol reduction cardiovascular risk factor . We believe removal single food component result reduction cholesterol-lowering effect similar extent predict cholesterol reduction observe food component consume alone . Method : 66 subject recruit 6-month 5 year long-term dietary portfolio study option continuation ( re-consenting ) end 6 , 12 24 month . The active dietary component consist viscous fiber ( include oat bran ) , soy product ( include soy milk ) , almonds plant sterol ( sterol-enriched margarine ) . Lipids , blood pressure , body weight , routine biochemical hematology analysis perform 5 year period , lipid blood pressure measure 2 monthly interval . 40-50 subject long term dietary portfolio study , diet least 1 year , ask remove specific food component regular dietary portfolio 10 week period . After 10 week period , subject asked return normal dietary portfolio food component consume continue long-term dietary portfolio . Bloods take week 0 , 6 10 food component removal period ; 2-monthly interval 20 week prior 10 week period long-term dietary portfolio food component .</detailed_description>
