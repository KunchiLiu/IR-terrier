	<detailed_description>Recent study show encouraging effect fitness train human cognition , brain structure function . Such effect great interest may tell u nature cognitive brain age also public health implication . This study test hypothesis : 1 ) improvement aerobic fitness old adult lead improved performance variety cognitive process , especially process supported frontal region brain ; 2 ) improvement cognitive process due enhance aerobic fitness visible fMRI scan , similar young adult ; 3 ) improvement aerobic fitness , course 1 year intervention , result increase gray white matter volume . One hundred forty sedentary old adult recruit study . Participants randomize aerobic exercise intervention group , stretch tone control group . Aerobic exercise session conduct three time week one year , begin light moderate intensity level first two month progress moderate high level remainder year . The control group meet basis intervention group , participate organize program stretching , limbering , tone whole body specially design individual 60 year age old . During time , participant exercise , keep daily exercise log detail distance walk ( route measure map participant ) , time spent aerobic activity , degree intensity ( rating perceive exertion ) , general level affect exercise , rest exercise heart rate . Participants participate MRI/fMRI , physiological ( cardiorespiratory ) psychosocial test prior begin fitness training intervention , follow 6 month fitness training , conclusion 1 year fitness training .</detailed_description>
