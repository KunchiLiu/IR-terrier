	<brief_title>Alefacept Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose optimal immunologic dose alefacept patient relapsed refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Secondary - Determine antitumor activity drug exist patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive alefacept IV 2-5 minute weekly 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease complete partial response induction therapy proceed maintenance therapy . Cohorts 6 patient receive escalate dos alefacept maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . The optimal immunologic dose define dose exceed MTD , high alefacept level , achieve saturation CD2 receptor . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive alefacept IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 10-12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression maintenance therapy may receive reinduction therapy* comprise 4 weekly dos alefacept . The patient proceeds second maintenance phase absence disease progression . NOTE : *Only 1 reinduction allow . Patients undergo blood tissue collection periodically pharmacological study . Blood serum analyze alefacept concentration , cytokine concentration , CD16 polymorphism , CD2 saturation via flow cytometry . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year periodically thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
