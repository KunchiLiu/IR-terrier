	<detailed_description>Phosphorus mineral find dairy product , nut , meat essential bone health many important function inside body 's cell . The kidney responsible keep blood level phosphorus normal . Healthy kidneys spill excess phosphorus urine . In patient chronic kidney disease , kidney unable spill adequate amount phosphorus excess phosphorus accumulate wall blood vessel lead heart disease , lead cause death . A recently discover hormone call FGF-23 help control blood level phosphorus `` tell '' kidney much phosphorus spill urine . The purpose study learn FGF-23 help kidneys control blood level phosphorus . The ultimate goal use information design improve treatment strategy phosphorus-related problem million patient chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
