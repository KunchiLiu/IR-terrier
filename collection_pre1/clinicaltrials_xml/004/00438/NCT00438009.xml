	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety tolerability two dos Coxsackievirus A21 , administer 48 hour apart superficial melanoma tumour . Injected non-injected tumour observe regard change tumour size . Coxsackievirus A21 ( CVA21 ) naturally occur virus , know cause self limit upper respiratory infection . CVA21 show cell culture infect kill human melanoma cancer cell line . This property CVA21 due specific receptor CVA21 use order attach , infect cell . The 2 receptor CVA21 use infect cell Intracellular Adhesion Molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) Decay Accelerating Factor . Both surface protein express melanoma cell line well human melanoma tumour . Animal model human melanoma tumour demonstrate CVA21 injection either intratumour intravenous cause infection tumour , result reduction tumour size growth .</brief_summary>

Fertile male female must agree use adequate form contraception , eg . Condoms male Negative pregnancy test require female patient child bear potential . Mucosal ocular tumour Presence CNS tumour Radiotherapy injection tumour site . Prior local radiotherapy without subsequent nodule progression Chemotherapy within 4 week screen visit . ECOG score great 1 . Life expectancy le 3 month . Pregnancy breast feed . Primary secondary immunodeficiency , include immunosuppressive dos corticosteroid ( prednisolone great 7.5 mg/day , immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine , azothioprine , interferon , within 4 week prior screen visit . Positive serology HIV , Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus Full dose anticoagulation , history bleeding diathesis , history difficult control bleed month screen visit . Previous splenectomy . Presence uncontrolled infection . Presence unstable neurological disease Any uncontrolled medical condition opinion Investigator likely place patient unacceptable risk study reduce ability complete study Participation another study require administration investigational drug biological agent within last 4 week prior screen visit . Known allergy treatment medication excipients Any medical psychological condition would preclude participation study compromise ability give inform consent .</criteria>
