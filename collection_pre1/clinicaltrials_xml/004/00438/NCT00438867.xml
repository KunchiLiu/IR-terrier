	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether one-time intracoronary infusion Ad5FGF-4 effective reducing time onset myocardial ischemia measure exercise treadmill test improve myocardial blood flow measure SPECT image . Exercise capacity , angina functional class , patient symptom quality life also evaluate characterize efficacy Ad5FGF-4 . Short-term long-term safety Ad5FGF-4 also evaluate .</brief_summary>

ECG change diagnostic myocardial ischemia occur first 10 minute exercise 2 . Variability time onset ECG change diagnostic myocardial ischemia ≤25 % within 60 second time onset myocardial ischemia occurs within first 4 minute exercise determine two consecutive screening treadmill test Evidence stress induce myocardial ischemia adenosine SPECT , define reversible perfusion defect size ≥9 % Willing able comply study requirement include longterm followup Provided write informed consent Patients childbearing potential ( must surgically sterile postmenopausal ) Patients immediate revascularization procedure indicate ( CABG surgery PCI ) Myocardial infarction within past 3 month Unstable angina hospitalization require intravenous antianginal therapy within 14 day prior start screen evaluation Congestive heart failure NYHA Class IV Electrocardiogram precludes accurate assessment exercise induce myocardial ischemia ( e.g. , leave bundle branch block , WolfParkinsonWhite syndrome , atrial fibrillation ) Myocarditis restrictive pericarditis Left main coronary stenosis ≥70 % ( unless patient patent graft collateral vessel supply leave coronary circulation ) proximal stenosis ≥70 % major coronary conduit vessel ( coronary artery bypass graft ) Clinically significant aortic mitral valvular heart disease Coronary ostial stenosis precludes adequate catheter engagement target vessel Coronary artery venous communication , bypass coronary capillary bed Untreated lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmia CABG surgery within past 6 month , unless graft occlude . Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTCA ) within past 3 month , unless dilate vessel ( ) occlude Enhanced external counterpulsation ( EECP ) within 3 month prior start screen evaluation Transmyocardial percutaneous myocardial laser revascularization within previous year Prior treatment cardiovascular gene stem cell therapy . Any intercurrent illness may interfere ability perform maximal ETT Any major organ disease substantially impair life expectancy . History cancer , basal cell carcinoma , patient laboratory physical exam diagnostic procedure find suggestive current malignancy Moderate severe nonproliferative proliferative retinopathy cause ( ETDRS score &gt; 35 ) , clinically significant macular edema , previous panretinal photocoagulation therapy Heparin induce thrombocytopenia history idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura medical condition cause thrombocytopenia SGPT level great 2.0 time upper limit laboratory normal range Bilirubin level ≥2.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL Platelet count &lt; 100,000/μL White blood cell count &lt; 3,000/μL Positive test hepatitis B C Positive test HIV History colon cancer first degree relative ( i.e. , parent , sibling offspring ) unless patient undergone colonoscopy past 36 month negative finding History breast cancer first degree relative Patient family document hereditary cancer syndrome Prior anaphylaxis reaction iodinate contrast agent Patients know immunosuppressed receive chronic treatment immunosuppressive drug Received investigational drug biologic within 30 day screen currently participate investigational drug , biologic device trial</criteria>
