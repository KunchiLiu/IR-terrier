	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , therapeutic autologous lymphocyte , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Cyclophosphamide may also stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell kill tumor cell . Giving therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together cyclophosphamide aldesleukin may effective treatment melanoma . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect give therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together cyclophosphamide aldesleukin treat patient stage IV melanoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Autologous Lymphocytes , Cyclophosphamide , Aldesleukin Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety toxicity cellular adoptive immunotherapy melanoma patient receive autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T cell clone follow cyclophosphamide condition post-infusion IL-2 . II . To assess duration vivo persistence adoptively transfer CD8+ T cell clone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate antitumor effect adoptively transfer CD8+ antigenspecific cytotoxic lymphocyte ( CTL ) clone follow cyclophosphamide condition post-infusion IL-2 . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1of 2 treatment cohort . All patient receive high-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -3 -2 autologous antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte clone IV 30-60 minute day 0 . COHORT I : Beginning within 6 hour T cell infusion , patient receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily day 0-14 . COHORT II : Beginning within 6 hour T cell infusion , patient receive high-dose aldesleukin IV 3 time daily day 0-5 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , 8 week , every 3 month thereafter 1 year .</detailed_description>
