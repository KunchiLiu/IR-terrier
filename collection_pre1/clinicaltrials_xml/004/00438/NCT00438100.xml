	<brief_title>Capecitabine vs. S-1 Unresectable Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence breast cancer increase Japan : 33,676 woman diagnose breast cancer 2001 , make leading cause cancer among woman since 1995 . Statistical database Exel format/outline health welfare statistic Ministry Labor , Health , Welfare show number death breast cancer 9,806 2003 . Because ten-year survival rate ninety percent Stages 0 I breast cancer patient , detection treatment earlier stage lead high survival rate . However , recurrence rate increase disease progress . In addition , thirty percent breast cancer patient believe recurrent disease . Thus , develop treatment recurrence may important task . The Guideline Breast Cancer Treatment , 2004 version , recommend chemotherapy , include anthracyclines taxanes first-line chemotherapy metastatic recurrent ( grade B recommendation ) breast cancer . In second-line therapy recommend metastatic recurrent disease , Guideline report combination capecitabine , 5Fu derivative ( oral chemotherapy pyrimidine fluoride approve 2003 ) docetaxel superior docetaxel alone improve survival . This regimen recommend patient cardiac malfunction treat anthracyclines ( grade B recommendation ) . However , data lack support capecitabine standard regimen second-line therapy ; efficacy need verification study . Accordingly , study design investigate efficacy safety S-1 alone , oral pyrimidine fluoride , indication `` inoperable recurrent breast cancer '' add , first-line therapy patient inoperable recurrent breast cancer compare Capecitabine alone , already approve indication .</detailed_description>
