	<brief_summary>The purpose trial re-evaluate potential role diet modulate cardiovascular risk factor . If potent lipid-lowering effect novel dietary intervention demonstrate , diet may see provide alternative drug therapy primary prevention cardiovascular disease . Aims : - To determine percentage lipid clinic attendee interested make serious dietary change . - To determine extent self select dietary portfolio combine viscous fiber food ( oat &amp; barley β-glucan , psyllium , etc . ) , soy vegetable protein food ( soy milk , soy meat analogue almond ) plant sterol ( sterol margarine ) diet significantly effective reduce LDL-cholesterol marker cardiovascular disease risk conventional dietary advice . - To determine whether effect maximize frequent follow-up , , , would relationship dietary compliance reduction LDL-C .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize parallel study three experimental arm 6 month duration estimate effect portfolio diet real world condition two level advice intensity . Every effort make obtain study blood sample data subject designate time regardless compliance dietary aspect study protocol . All subject use intent-to-treat analysis . Four Canadian Centers involve : Vancouver , Toronto , Manitoba Quebec City . The study partially blind . The investigator technical staff blind dietitian patient , owe difference taste appearance study food . The blinding physicians clinic visit likely difficult due requirement ask question relate diet . All patient refer four collaborate clinic ask whether would prepare modify diet may mean might lower blood cholesterol without use drug . Those checked box `` No '' `` modest dietary change '' would consider . Those checked box `` significant '' `` radical dietary change '' would invite participate , provide high risk ( &lt; 20 % 10 yr risk ) CHD within 30 % target LDL-C concentration accord current Canadian Working Group recommendation i.e. , would normally consider preliminary test diet . The three group would randomize either low saturate fat , low cholesterol diet ( Step 2 ) portfolio diet give routine clinical advice week zero follow 3 6 month intensive advice reinforce ( intensive portfolio ) clinic visit 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 20 week . In routine portfolio , advice therefore consist two half hour session dietitian ( 0 12 week ) , compare seven intensive portfolio ( 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 20 week ) . Prior start diet nature diet explain participant instruction achieve diet goal give . Follow-up visit use go subject ' diet record , record previous 7 day , reinforce original dietary advice . The intensive portfolio participant therefore receive five additional instructional assessment follow visit course study . Trial treatment : The portfolio dietary advice conform current therapeutic diet appropriate hypercholesterolemic subject ( &lt; 7 % energy saturate fat , &lt; 200 mg/d cholesterol ) plus combination viscous fiber , soy protein , plant sterol almonds . The portfolio diet plan include food contribute 8 g/1000 kcal viscous fiber β-glucan ( oat , barley , oat bran bread soup ) psyllium ( cereal ) , 1 g plant sterol/1000 kcal diet ( sterol margarine ) , 22 g soy protein/1000 kcal ( soy burger , dog , link , meat analogue , milk , yogurt cheese ) 22 g almonds/1000 kcal . The Step 2 therapeutic diet encourage similar macronutrient profile use cereal fiber whole grain . All diet emphasize fruit vegetable intake ( 5-10 servings/d ) accord current recommendation . Participants instruct select follow diet provide margarine component portfolio Step 2 therapeutic diet . The Step 2 therapeutic diet group encourage follow diet whole grain food ( brown rice , whole wheat bread , muffin breakfast cereal ) , low saturate fat meat dairy food control margarine . The degree portfolio diet make effective routine instruction compare intensive instruction key issue study . Duration Subject participation sequence duration trial period : Subject participation start screen visit follow week minus 2 visit 4 6 week later . The week minus 2 visit follow week 0 visit . Study duration 6 month , participant option continue another 6 month . Diets self-selected , low-fat , low-cholesterol , NCEP Step 2 diet ( &lt; 7 % saturated fat , &lt; 200 mg dietary cholesterol/d ) . The test control margarine provide free . The oat bran bread provide cost . The control diet encourage low saturate fat intake ( &lt; 7 % ) use low fat dairy product egg substitute ( Fleischmann 's egg beater ) . Fiber increase 17 g/1000 kcal recommend insoluble cereal fiber whole meal whole grain flour cereal product lipid neutral conform current diet guideline fiber intake appear offer protection CHD . This ensure equal total fiber intake NCEP Portfolio diet . The control margarine ( 45 g/d ) fatty acid composition test margarine . The Portfolio treatment diet similar fatty acid macronutrient profile control treatment diet . Low-fat Dairy egg protein source replace soy ( approximately 45 g/d ) protein . Foods include soy dairy food ( milk , yogurt &amp; cheese ) , meat analogue make soy isolate ( dogs burger etc ) tofu product . The fiber include least 15 g viscous fiber daily oat , barley , dried bean , pea , lentils psyllium cereal . Plant sterol ( 1g/1000 kcal diet ) 3g/day recommended test margarine provide consumed quantity 40 g/day . A control margarine quantity ( 25-40 g/d ) provide participant control group . Almonds ( 22g/1000 kcal ) , FDA recommend dose cholesterol reduction ) also include diet . The protein fiber component individualize much possible achieve study goal satisfy individual preference . The portfolio diet prescribe two level reinforcement . In one portfolio cohort , advice general provide 2 occasion 6 month period . For second portfolio cohort , advice much intensive provide 7 occasion ( total 8 visit ) 6 month period . Participants control less intensive portfolio treatment group see week 0 , 12 , 24 optionally 36 52 week . While participant intensive portfolio treatment group see two-weekly interval first month monthly next five month ( final visit 6 month ) two monthly interval thereafter ( study extend 12 month ) ensure diet plan acceptable . Participants , intensive advice group , provide self-taring scale weigh food consume .</detailed_description>
