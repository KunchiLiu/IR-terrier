	<detailed_description>Accruing evidence demonstrate anxiety disorder common associate significant morbidity impairment . Although current first-line intervention effective , many patient remain least somewhat symptomatic , respond , despite initial treatment . For instance , Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) common distress disabling condition affect 5 % population . It typically characterize chronic course associate significant psychosocial impairment decrease quality life ( Simon Pollack 2000 ) .

Although study panic disorder advance recent year , availability grow number treatment report efficacy clinical trial practice , acute longitudinal follow-up study patient panic disorder suggest many individual remain symptomatic despite treatment ( Pollack Otto , 1994 ) . However , systematic data currently available guide treatment patient panic disorder remain symptomatic initial intervention . Thus , one purpose study examine efficacy addition aripiprazole , treatment patient GAD panic disorder remain refractory despite treatment trial anxiolytic ( e.g . antidepressant , benzodiazepine , buspirone ) . Aripiprazole novel antipsychotic agent potent effect serotonergic , well dopaminergic receptor , favorable side effect profile standard neuroleptic , include low potential cause extrapyramidal symptom . The study period 9-week , acute treatment phase . Patients meet inclusion criterion receive aripiprazole 8 week . Treatment initiate 2.5 mg/day baseline visit , 5 mg/day aripiprazole first week flexibly titrate maximum 30 mg/day next six week . Patients see weekly first three week phase treatment , 2-week interval remainder study .</detailed_description>
