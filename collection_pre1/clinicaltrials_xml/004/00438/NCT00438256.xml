	<brief_summary>A standard treatment pancreatic cancer radiation therapy plus chemotherapy surgery . Radiation therapy chemotherapy commonly give six week . Previous research suggest give radiation chemotherapy shorter amount time ( accelerated schedule ) surgery may well tolerate . In research study , different schedule proton radiation therapy use . Each schedule give total dose radiation . However , total dose spread different time period different number session . The purpose find short schedule radiation therapy give without unacceptable side effect . Proton beam radiation use unique ability deposit energy directly tumor , result less radiation normal tissue . A new type PET scan also study see help predict response pre-surgery treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Not everyone participate research study receive schedule radiation therapy . The schedule radiation therapy depend number participant enrol study well tolerate radiation schedule . All patient receive proton beam therapy . - Here propose schedule radiation therapy . If point many subject experience many unacceptable side effect , subject enrol next level . Dose Level 1 : 10 radiation session give Monday-Friday two week . Dose Level 2 : 5 radiation session give Monday , Wednesday Friday Week 1 Tuesday Thursday Week 2 . Dose Level 3 : 5 radiation session give Monday , Tuesday , Thursday Friday Week 1 Monday Week 2 . Dose Level 4 : 5 Radiation session give Monday Friday Week 1 . - In Dose Levels 2 , 3 4 , few radiation session , radiation dose give session slightly high dose give 10 session Dose Level 1 . - Capecitabine give orally ( pill form ) start first day radiation therapy take two week participant receives radiation therapy . - On day 1 , 8 15 study cycle , participant see clinic : physical examination , question side effect ; routine blood test . - After last day study treatment six-week rest period surgery perform . - About three six week participant finish study treatment , follow procedure do : CT MRI , physical examination ; question side effect blood test .</detailed_description>
