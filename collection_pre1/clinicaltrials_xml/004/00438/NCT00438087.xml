	<detailed_description>Facial palsy surgical removal cranial base tumor adherent nerve partly explain inflammation . The purpose study assess efficiency corticosteroid prevent facial palsy surgery identify patient high benefit anti-inflammatory treatment . This study include patient undergoing surgery benign tumor cranial base ( vestibular schwannoma ) . The efficiency high dosage corticosteroid administer intravenously surgery evaluate facial nerve function comparison placebo . Pre operative intra operative data collect analysed order investigate possible predictive factor response treatment . Introduction : After surgical removal cerebella-pontine angle tumor ( mainly vestibular schwannoma ) , despite anatomical integrity facial nerve , immediate delay facial palsy may occur . This palsy may explain ischemia , edema , inflammation , neurotmesis ( ruptured axon intact nerve sheet ) . This phenomenon highly dependent size tumor . In preliminary study , observe immediate facial palsy 16 % palsy occur postoperative day 8 23 % patient operate vestibular schwannoma . Corticosteroids may decrease inflammation edema around nerve reduce incidence postoperative facial palsy . Their efficiency already demonstrate idiopathic facial palsy . In previously publish study , single dose dexamethasone surgery influence facial function outcome . But short period treatment allow definitive conclusion . Objectives : The aim study analyze effect corticosteroid ( methyl prednisolone ) administer intra- postoperatively incidence facial palsy surgery cerebella-pontine angle tumor determine intra operative prognostic factor facial function outcome . Material Methods : A multi center , prospective , randomize , versus placebo , double-blind study undertaken . Four-hundred patient undergo surgery cerebellopontine angle tumor include 23 month . Three university department otolaryngology ( Hospital BEAUJON , CHU de Bordeaux , CHU de Tours ) participate . The pre operative assessment include clinical examination assessment facial function ( 6 grade accord House BRACKMANN ) , audiometry vestibular testing , cranial MRI classification tumor 4 stage accord size . Patients randomized information consent . During surgery , degree nerve stretch ( 4 stage ) , tumor adhesion nerve ( 4 stage ) stimulation threshold facial nerve electromyographic monitoring device ( NIM Response 2 , XOMED MEDTRONICS , Jacksonville , FL ) record . All case facial nerve interruption surgery exclude . In treated group , one IV injection methyl prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day administer intra operatively postoperative day 1 2 . The treatment continue day 3 7 dosage orally . Subsequently , 0.5 mg/kg/day day 8 8 , 0.25 mg/kg/day day 10 11 . The facial function assess postoperative day 1 , 8 30 clinically . Expected result : Considering effect corticosteroid idiopathic facial palsy effect agent edema inflammation , expect decrease incidence immediate delay postoperative facial palsy . The intra operative stimulation threshold may indicate subgroup patient efficiency corticosteroid higher whole series . Conclusion : The facial palsy surgery cerebellopontine angle tumor frequent significant morbidity . Corticosteroids may decrease incidence complication .</detailed_description>
