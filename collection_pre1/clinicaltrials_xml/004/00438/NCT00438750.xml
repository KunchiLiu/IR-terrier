	<brief_title>Comparison Occupational Therapy Home Exercises Adults With Operatively Treated Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Operative treatment distal radius fracture become commonplace last three decade understand relationship alignment distal radius function wrist forearm improve . Over last 15 year trend towards invasive , internal plate fixation fracture distal radius . One argument favor internal fixation fracture would beneficial allow early movement wrist articulation attempt maximize final outcome . There difference opinion among physician importance supervision exercise recovery process . Some physician advocate formal occupational therapy physician believe appropriate instruction home exercise good . A common belief motivation patient play important part recovery . In addition , Psychological personality factor , pain anxiety , catastrophizing , depression strongly relate upper extremity specific health status may also influence recovery . The goal study determine protocol exercise lead well outcome patient treat distal radius volar plate . As secondary goal generate hypothesis late study would like evaluate influence psychosocial factor objective ( motion , grip strength ) subjective ( DASH questionnaire ) measure functional recovery .</detailed_description>
