	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving sunitinib malate surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving sunitinib malate surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give sunitinib malate surgery work treat patient metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Before After Surgery Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine neoadjuvant sunitinib malate achieve clinical benefit 70 % primary renal tumor prior surgery adjuvant sunitinib malate patient metastatic renal cancer . Secondary - Determine time radiological progression patient . - Determine overall survival patient . - Determine proportion patient suitable nephrectomy neoadjuvant sunitinib malate . - Determine translational endpoint . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 3 course . Approximately 2 week later , patient undergo standard radical nephrectomy lymph node dissection . Beginning least 2 week surgery , patient receive oral sunitinib malate day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tissue sample may collect periodically laboratory study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
