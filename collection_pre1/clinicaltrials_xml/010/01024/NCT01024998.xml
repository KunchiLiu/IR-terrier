	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Study AAV2-sFLT01 Patients With Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new treatment neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) investigate . Neovascular AMD sometimes refer `` wet '' form AMD . The purpose Phase 1 clinical research study examine safety ability experimental study drug treat complication disease lead vision loss . The name study drug `` AAV2-sFLT01 . '' This experimental study drug use virus transfer gene ( genetic code ) cell within eye . The gene code protein intended diminish growth abnormal blood vessel retina . The duration gene 's effect currently unknown , might last year . This clinical research study look safety single administration AAV2-sFLT01 inject directly eye . There 2 part study , patient take part one . In first part study , 4 different dos study drug study 4 separate group patient . Patients first part study randomize . In second part study , high dose safe well tolerate study 10 patient . Patients part study may ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) injection 26 week AAV2-sFLT01 injection verify responsiveness anti-VEGF therapy , demonstrate response AAV2-sFLT01 . The initial two part protocol expect complete July , 2013 . All patient inject AAV2-sFLT01 ask participate Extended Follow-Up ( EFU ) program additional 4 year . Participation voluntary strongly encourage allows long term collection safety information well information potential long term effect study drug . Study visit take place site every 6 month . Up thirty-four ( 34 ) patient multiple center take part study United States .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Choroidal neovascular membrane ( CNV ) secondary AMD , confirm patient 's medical history document diagnosis CNV . Distance BCVA 20/100 worse study eye . The fellow eye must distance BCVA 20/400 well . The study eye , i.e. , eye receives investigational product , bad CVA ( As compare fellow eye ) . Subfoveal disciform scar study eye first part study ( doseescalation part ) . Patients may may macular scar study eye second part study ( MTD phase ) . In addition , patient enrol second part study must demonstrate responsiveness antiVEGF therapy within 12 month prior screen patient 's recent treatment antiVEGF therapy . Noted presence intra subretinal fluid . Adequate dilation pupil permit thorough ocular examination test . Must willing sample anterior chamber fluid collect study eye . CNV study eye due reason AMD . History condition study eye Screening might alter visual acuity interfere study test . Active uncontrolled glaucoma . Had intraocular surgery study eye within 3 month enrollment know likely candidate intraocular surgery ( include cataract surgery ) study eye within 1 year treatment . Acute chronic infection study eye . History inflammation study eye ongoing inflammation either eye . Any contraindication intravitreal injection . Received Photo Dynamic Therapy study eye within 60 day , laser photocoagulation within 14 day prior Screening . Currently use use ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) , bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) , pegaptanib sodium ( Macugen® ) within 1 month prior Screening . Currently use use Aflibercept ( Eylea® ) within 4 month prior Screening . Currently use periocular ( study eye ) , intravitreal ( study eye ) , systemic ( oral intravenous ) steroid within 3 month prior Screening . Any active herpetic infection , particular active lesion eye face . Any significant poorly control illness would preclude study compliance followup . Current prior use medication know toxic retina optic nerve . Previous treatment ocular systemic gene transfer product . Received investigational product within 120 day prior Screening .</criteria>
