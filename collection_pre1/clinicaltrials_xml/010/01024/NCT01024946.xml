	<brief_summary>For patient malignant pleural mesothelioma grown despite treatment standard chemotherapy , treatment yet prove beneficial . The purpose study find effect , good bad , everolimus cancer . Everolimus work block protein help cancer grow . The goal clinical research study learn study drug everolimus shrink slow growth mesothelioma . The safety drug also study . The patient ' physical state , change size tumor , laboratory finding take study help u decide everolimus safe effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus ( RAD001 ) Treatment Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma With Merlin/NF2 Loss Biomarker Predict Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open label , phase II study everolimus second third line therapy treatment advance malignant pleural mesothelioma , also evaluate Merlin/NF2 loss biomarker predict sensitivity everolimus . Patients disease progression one two prior chemotherapy regimen eligible . In first stage design , 19 patient accrue . If 6 less patient among first 19 patient show clinical benefit , study terminate declared negative . If 7 patient show clinical benefit , additional 20 patient accrued second stage . At end study , 17 patient show clinical benefit total 39 patient enrol , regimen consider worthy investigation .</detailed_description>
