	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study obtain preliminary data new way image breast combine benefit 3-D anatomical technique ( Digital Tomosynthesis ) functional imaging technique ( Molecular Breast Imaging ) . Combining data 2 modality would provide co-registered functional anatomical information breast , way PET/CT today oncology . This greatly facilitate evaluation biopsy lesion see MBI occult conventional mammography .</detailed_description>
