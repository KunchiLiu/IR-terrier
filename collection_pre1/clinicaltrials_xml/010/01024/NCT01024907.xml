	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy , proton beam radiation therapy , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study best way give proton beam radiation therapy see well work treat patient low grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Beam Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Low Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility proton beam radiation therapy patient low grade glioma . ( Phase I ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess late complication irradiation use proton beam therapy place conventional photon beam therapy treatment low grade glioma . ( Phase II ) II . To assess acute side effect irradiation use proton beam therapy place conventional photon beam therapy treatment low grade glioma . ( Phase II ) III . To compare dose distribution tumor surround normal structure use DVH 's ( Dose Volume Histograms ) generate proton plan use treat patient photon plan generate comparison purpose . ( Phase II ) IV . To monitor rate local control , overall disease specific survival use proton radiotherapy . ( Phase II ) V. To evaluate time progression low grade glioma treat proton . ( Phase II ) VI . To evaluate incidence severity fatigue low grade glioma treat proton . ( Phase II ) VII . To evaluate effect proton beam radiation neurocognitive outcome patient low grade glioma . ( Phase II ) VIII . To evaluate quality life patient treat low grade glioma . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
