	<brief_summary>During minimally invasive surgery case , 5-25mm size incision need make gain access abdomen . One difficult , time-consuming , sometimes unreliable part case closing incision , especially obese patient . This mainly incision small layer need close ( fascia ) rest deep underneath skin fat tissue abdominal wall . Two investigator ( CM BS ) develop Stanford instrument allow easier reliable closure wound . The purpose study test instrument closure laparoscopic wound obese patient undergo laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Evaluate Laparoscopic Fascial Closure Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient enrol study , preoperative postoperative care exactly . The operative procedure also similar modification way port close end surgery fact port 11mm great close ( instead leave 11 12mm port close discretion surgeon ) . Instead use suture-passer place suture fascia , surgeon use new instrument drive suture tissue direct visualization umbilical port camera . The instrument new suture use interrupted stitch usually place close port . The instrument develop investigator 10mm elongated device easily insert port fascial opening . If insert port , trocar slide instrument remove trocar without lose pneumoperitoneum . The instrument two oppose wing open place beyond fascial opening . As surgeon pull device , wing open slide along fascia push away intra-abdominal content may close instrument . Once surgeon assures direct visualization camera wing open side wound intra-abdominal content way ( surgeon would standard technique ) , push plunger drive two flexible nitinol needle shaft instrument , fascia , wing . The needle receive wing set coupler attached suture would use otherwise ( # 0 Vycril ) . The surgeon release wing pull device , leave looped suture place around opening . The surgeon tie suture would normally standard procedure . At time , surgeon reposition remove instrument without place suture . The procedure may repeat many time surgeon considers necessary ( usually 1 close 11 12mm fascial port 2 3 close 25mm fascial port ) .</detailed_description>
