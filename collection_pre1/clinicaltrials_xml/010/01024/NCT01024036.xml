	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate CNTO 328 administer combination best supportive care ( BSC ) superior BSC term durable tumor symptomatic response ( complete response partial response ) among patient Multicentric Castleman 's Disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety CNTO328 Plus Best Supportive Care Multicentric Castleman 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double blind ( neither investigator participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo control ( inactive substance compare study medication test whether study medication real effect clinical study ) , study ass efficacy safety CNTO 328 plus BSC compare BSC patient symptomatic Multicentric Castleman 's Disease . The study mainly consist 3 phase , include : screening phase ( majority assessment perform within 28 day first dose ) , treatment phase ( blind unblinded ) , follow phase . In blinded treatment phase , approximately 78 patient randomly assign 1:2 ratio either 2 treatment group , ie , Placebo + BSC , CNTO 328 + BSC . Participants receive placebo + BSC blind treatment period respond treatment failure option crossover receive siltuximab + BSC unbllinded treatent period . The follow phase 3 month last dose study medication survival follow study end . Safety evaluation adverse event , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram , vital sign , patient-recorded temperature , physical examination monitor throughout study . The total study duration 5 year last patient start study medication .</detailed_description>
