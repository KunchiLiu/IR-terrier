	<brief_summary>The investigator propose ass whether intervention build capacity improve delivery drug diagnostics government-run health facility improve health child quality care deliver , compare 'standard care ' currently available health facility , supplement service provide private sector community-based intervention . The target population divide 20 cluster , define catchment area lower-level public health facility . Clusters randomize health facility intervention ( HFI ) standard care deliver government-run health facility , supplement service provide private sector community-based intervention . The intervention design address barrier deliver quality care health center focus three component : ( 1 ) train in-charges health center management , ( 2 ) provide train health worker fever case management patient-centered service , ( 3 ) ensure adequate supply artemether-lumefantrine RDTs . Outcomes measure three distinct population : ( 1 ) cross-sectional survey child 15 year randomly select household within cluster ; ( 2 ) cohort child five randomly select household within cluster follow 2 year ; ( 3 ) patient attend government-run health facility , include child five caregiver participate exit interview select day every six month .

	<detailed_description>Study overview : We propose evaluate enhance health facility-based care malaria febrile illness child Tororo district use cluster randomize design . The health facility intervention ( HFI ) aim address barrier achieve good quality health care identify formative research . The focus intervention provide RDTs train health worker management malaria non-malarial febrile illness . Study site : The study conduct Tororo district , area high malaria transmission intensity . The estimated entomologic inoculation rate ( EIR ) Tororo 562 infective bite per person-year , prevalence parasitemia among child age 5-9 year 63.5 % . The five sub-counties West Budama North Health Sub-district ( Nagongera , Paya , Kirewa , Kisoko , Petta ) , two sub-counties West Budama South Health Sub-district ( Mulanda Rubongi ) include study population . Study population : Within seven sub-counties , 22 lower-level government run health facility , include 17 level II health center ( HC ) , 5 level III HCs ; 20 include randomization scheme . Randomization : The lower-level government-run health facility study area unit randomization . Clusters define catchment area health center , include household locate within 2km radius facility . The cluster define prior randomization use full census survey database . Households exclude sample frame &gt; 2km health facility . The randomization conduct investigator directly involve project . Health facility stratify level ( HC IIs HC IIIs ) . Because uneven number HC IIs IIIs , one HC IIIs without laboratory 'demoted ' pair HC II ensure even number . Restricted randomization employ ensure balance geographical location . Specifically , restriction apply exclude allocation cluster originate single sub-county , otherwise close geographical proximity allocate arm trial . The Health Facility Intervention : The intervention design address barrier deliver quality care health center focus three component : ( 1 ) train in-charges health center management , ( 2 ) provide train health worker fever case management patient-centered service , ( 3 ) ensure adequate supply artemether-lumefantrine RDTs . 1 . Training in-charges : All in-charges health center randomize HFI train health center management . The purpose training equip in-charges skill tool require effectively efficiently manage health center . The training include three component : ( 1 ) financial management , ( 2 ) supply management , ( 3 ) information management . 2 . Health worker training : A ) Training fever case management use RDTs All clinical staff receive training fever case management . Training base Integrated Malaria Management training package develop Joint Uganda Malaria Training Program ( JUMP ) team , RDT train guideline adopt implemented Uganda 's MoH 'User 's manual : Use Rapid Diagnostic Tests ( RDTs ) malaria fever case management Uganda ' . The training program conduct JUMP train team two week ; first two day focus theory , follow support supervision health facility next week . The training conduct Tororo local health facility , health worker train two small group ensure work health facility continue alongside training . The impact training knowledge assess use pre-and post-training evaluation administer JUMP team . Additional support supervision conduct 6 week 6 month initial train refresher training provide need . B ) Training patient-centered service The purpose Patient-Centered Services ( PCS ) training module identify improve interpersonal interaction health worker patient . The module build result formative research identify several barrier prove good quality health care health facility , include poor interpersonal interaction health worker community member result poor communication skill , discriminatory behavior health worker , poor health worker motivation , lack patient-centered thinking . Through PCS module , health worker learn recognize challenge develop skill communicate interact patient . The PCS module training implement tiered approach ( 1 ) clinical staff , ( 2 ) health center support staff . All clinical staff , include in-charges , receive full PCS training package include self-observation task specific emphasis clinical patient interaction challenge . Support staff include volunteer receive scaled-down PCS training package specific emphasis welcome guide patient health facility . All training activity workshop lead study personnel trainer experience adult learn methodology . 3 . Supply AL RDTs malaria If amount AL provide intervention health center NMS adequate meet demand , procurement AL fails , project supply supplemental AL . In addition , ensure adequate supply RDTs intervention health center . Evaluation procedure : Outcomes measure three distinct population : ( 1 ) cross-sectional survey child 15 year randomly select household within cluster ; ( 2 ) cohort child five randomly select household within cluster follow 2 year ; ( 3 ) patient attend government-run health facility , include child five caregiver participate exit interview select day every six month . 1 . Cross-sectional survey conduct randomly select child under-five , age 5-15 year age . The number child sample weight accord total population cluster achieve harmonic mean 200 age category . A total 8766 child sample survey . Surveys conduct baseline annually year ; new population child select survey . The survey include structure questionnaire administer primary caregiver , clinical laboratory assessment child . 2 . A Cohort child five enrol 25 household randomly select cluster , total 500 household . The cohort dynamic , child within household , age five meet selection criterion , include . A household survey conduct start study . Children undergo clinical laboratory assessment baseline every six month . Primary caregiver ask prospectively collect information clinical symptom participate child expenditures health care use pictorial diary . Study personnel visit household monthly collect diary administer monthly questionnaire . Participants follow approximately 18 month total , equivalent approximately 12 month follow roll-out intervention . 3 . Patient Exit Interviews conduct child five caregiver health facility . The purpose interview evaluate rational prescribing ACTs , determine level satisfaction health facility visit . Three round survey plan . In first two survey , 10 patient select convenience sample facility participate interview ( 200 total per survey ) . In final survey , 50 patient recruit participate ( 1000 total survey ) . In total , 1400 patient participate interview .</detailed_description>
