	<brief_summary>Early walking aid routinely use UK rehabilitation patient knee amputation . The two main walk aid use commonly practice include non-articulated Pneumatic Post Amputation Mobility Aid ( PPAM ) Articulated Amputee Mobility Aid ( AMA ) . There publish evidence whether articulate walking aid improve knee control shorten delivery time . This study design test hypothesis articulate early walking aid benefit transtibial amputee compare non-articulated early walking aid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physiotherapists UK routinely use Early Walking Aids ( EWA 's ) enable low limb amputee start walk early 5 day post amputation ( Lein S. 1992 ) . An EWA many benefit include reduction oedema ( Reith et al , 1992 ) early gait balance training preparation use prosthesis . The two EWA 's commonly use UK transtibial amputee Pneumatic Post Amputation Mobility aid ( PPAM ) Amputee Mobility Aid ( AMA ) . A comparison PPAM aid AMA undertake Longmore T ( 1997 ) report significant difference energy cost , comfort ease use . Scott et al ( 2000 ) find AMA high interface pressure PPAM aid . There however know publish evidence whether articulated EWA improve active knee control follow prosthetic delivery therefore shorten rehabilitation time . In addition know publish evidence effect quality life two different EWA 's . Hypothesis : An articulated Early walking aid benefit transtibial amputee compare non- articulated EWA . The purpose propose research investigate whether benefit patient use articulated EWA . The study use EMG gait analysis determine potential two EWA 's re-educate gait way comparable gait exhibit subject subsequently begin use prosthesis thus shorten rehabilitation time . Quality life indicator use determine impact patient , addition , length time take full rehabilitation consider .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients include trial : Have unilateral transtibial amputation yet receive prosthesis Are expect receive functional prosthesis Are least 18 year age Are able tolerate use early walking aid Are able able walk distance 4 metre Will attend Hull East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust prosthetic rehabilitation . Meet manufacturer recommendation use EWA 's Patients exclude trial : Have major amputation contra lateral limb . Are expect receive functional prosthesis Were unable walk , prior amputation , due medical condition e.g . spinal injury , stroke rheumatoid arthritis Are unable follow instruction and/or participate programme rehabilitation . Do consent participate study . Do meet manufacturer recommendation use EWA 's</criteria>
