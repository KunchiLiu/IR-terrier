	<detailed_description>Double Blinded Randomized control study Conventional Laparoscopic Appendectomy Vs Transumbilical Single Incision Laparoscopic Appendicectomy Introduction : Laparoscopic appendicectomy widely practice HA hospital nowadays short hospital stay less wound complication . Most time , three small wound less 10mm adequate enough completion surgery minimal pain . Recently , concept Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ( N.O.T.E.S ) lead attention single incision laparoscopic surgery ( SILS ) surgical community [ 1,2,3 ] new idea . The first SILS cholecystectomy report 1997 Navarra et al . However , close proximity instrument , limitation triangulation dissection suboptimal exposure surgical field make approach unpopular last decade . Because concept N.O.T.E.S newly design access port , surgeon focus SILS . The Chinese University Hong Kong recently release preliminary result use SILS appendicectomy satisfactory result term less post-operative pain less prominent scar . However , case series limit number patient . In order test advantage SILS management patient acute appendicitis , double blind randomize clinical trial conduct . Statistical Analysis : The primary outcome trial evaluate operative time , post-operative pain wound infection rate . The work alternative hypothesis significant difference umbilical wound infection rate Conventional Laparoscopic Appendectomy Transumbilical Single Incision Laparoscopic Appendicectomy . At least 80 patient ( 40 case group ) need demonstrate 25 % difference umbilical wound infection rate statistical significance level P &gt; 0.05 power 80 % . All analysis comparison two group perform intention-to-treat basis . The Student t-test , Mann-Whitney U test , Chi-square test Fisher exact test appropriate use compare result group . All calculation perform software SPSS Window version 15.0 ( SPSS , Inc , USA ) . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistical significant . Detailed Description : This study seek examine ability single incision laparoscopic appendicectomy reduce post-operative pain increase cosmetic outcome expense long operation time high cost . Patients randomize preoperatively computer generate random allocation either receive conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy transumbilical single incision laparoscopic appendicectomy . Control group : Patients undergo conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy . A 10-mm subumbilical port insert open method . Two 5-mm work port insert laparoscopic view patient 's left lower quadrant suprapubic area . Umbilical fascia close PDS-1 J-shape needle . Local anaesthetic agent , Marcain 0.5 % infiltrated fascial layer well skin layer dosage 20ml . All skin wound approximate 3-0 nylon interrupt stitch cover non-transparent dressing . Compare group : Patients undergo transumbilical single incision laparoscopic appendicectomy . A single incision make umbilicus within margin umbilical skin ring . Peritoneal cavity enter open method fascia layer extend 2.5cm length . A single incision laparoscopic device ( Olympus ) insert . Conventional laparoscopic instrument use . Umbilical fascia close PDS-1 J-shape needle . Marcain 0.5 % infiltrated fascial layer well skin layer dosage 20ml . The umbilicus reconstruct interrupted 3-0 nylon tack skin onto fascia layer . Three non-transparent dressing place conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy do . Randomization : Randomization perform consent surgery . Patients randomly assign mean seal envelope contain computer-generated random number follow group : 1 . Control group ( conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy ) 2 . Compare group ( single port laparoscopic appendicectomy )</detailed_description>
