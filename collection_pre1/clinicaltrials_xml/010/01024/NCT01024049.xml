	<brief_summary>The diagnosis asymptomatic leave ventricular dysfunction difficult general practice since require transthoracic cardiac echocardiography generally perform specialized service . Although blood BNP level monitor help heart failure diagnosis mostly late biomarker secrete upon heart stretch many limitation . Therefore aim study identify new specific blood biomarkers would help asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction diagnosis large population cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recognition asymptomatic leave ventricular dysfunction ( ALVD ) early stage heart failure ( HF ) diagnostic challenge physician . Patient history physical examination may fail provide definitive diagnosis ; additional testing require aid diagnosis . More 20 million people worldwide estimate HF . Despite recent therapeutic advance , morbidity mortality onset heart failure remain high ( 35 % 5 year diagnosis ) . In addition , annual cost heart failure estimate great myocardial infarction cancer combine . Consequently , prevention heart failure identification management risk factor preclinical phase disease priority . Clearly identification asymptomatic patient difficult would prevent development HF initiation early adapt medical non medical treatment . We propose search marker ALVD , patient cardiovascular risk factor . These new biomarkers earlier , specific accurate one already B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , recently , establish . BNP clearly associate HF relatively late stage marker HF specific HF . In addition BNP show poor marker obese diabetic patient . Therefore need early specific biomarkers LVD HF irreversibly initiate strong . We propose compare blood sample 5 group patient carefully define : 1 ) without cardiovascular risk factor ; 2 ) With cardiovascular risk factor without ALVD ; 3 ) With cardiovascular risk factor ALVD . 4 ) chronic heart failure patient ; 5 ) Acute heart failure patient . Groups match risk factor treatment . Three distinct approach perform : - A transcriptomics one monitor white blood cell transcriptome ; proteomic one use high throughput SELDI-TOF profile metabolic profile one use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance .</detailed_description>
