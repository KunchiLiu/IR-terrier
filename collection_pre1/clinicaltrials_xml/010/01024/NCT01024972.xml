	<brief_summary>Subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) devastate acute brain injury due bleed onto brain surface rupture aneurysm . Cerebral vasospasm ( cVSP ; critical narrowing brain artery ) know complication SAH significantly increase disability death SAH . Vasospasm difficult treat lead stroke . Animal study show muscle artery wall play role cVSP . Dantrolene FDA approve extensively use clinical practice muscle relaxant 30 year . It show provide benefit animal study cVSP , well small number human . However , first human study observational short period time . This study evaluate safety tolerability intravenous dantrolene give every 6 hour seven day patient risk cVSP SAH . The goal determine future efficacy study do determine treatment Dantrolene may improve outcome patient cVSP SAH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Dantrolene Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once eligibility criterion meet , patient randomize either dantrolene-IV placebo ( equiosmolar , volume-equivalent sterile water 5 % mannitol dantrolene-IV also contain 5 % mannitol ) . Study subject visit daily study nurse determine side effect , tolerability , record hemodynamic measure laboratory value . Patients daily serum Na , osmolality , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase ( ALK ) measure . In addition , daily bedside transcranial doppler perform blinded examiner . Patients undergo cerebral angiogram per clinical routine . Angiographic measurement arterial narrowing perform blinded radiologist . Specific stop criterion pre-defined .</detailed_description>
