	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. Perform genome-wide scan test locus associate acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) relapse infection risk . II . Validate positive association see genome-wide scan fine mapping approach . III . Perform simulate clinical trial use germline genetic variation data test feasibility use genetic data inform clinical care pediatric patient AML . OUTLINE : Germline DNA obtain previously collect peripheral blood bone marrow sample array-based genotyping study , include genome-wide association study ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) fine map genotyping . Clinical trial simulation perform test clinical applicability use genetic variation data management infectious complication .</detailed_description>
