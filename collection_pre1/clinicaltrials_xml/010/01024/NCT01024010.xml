	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , ofatumumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , pentostatin cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving ofatumumab together pentostatin cyclophosphamide may better way block cancer growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give ofatumumab together pentostatin cyclophosphamide work treat patient untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab , Pentostatin , Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Arm A : To assess rate complete response use pentostatin , cyclophosphamide , ofatumumab patient previously untreated CLL SLL require therapy . II . Arm B : To assess treatment-free survival rate 18 month use pentostatin , cyclophosphamide , ofatumumab induction therapy follow ofatumumab consolidation patient previously untreated CLL SSLL require therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Arm A Arm B : To assess rate overall response patient previously untreated CLL SLL require therapy determine proportion patient achieve minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negative state assess flow cytometry arm independently . II . Arm A Arm B : To monitor assess toxicity patient previously untreated CLL SLL arm independently . III . Arm A Arm B : To determine progression-free survival , treatment-free survival , duration response arm independently . IV . Arm A Arm B : To determine molecular prognostic parameter ( ZAP-70 , CD38 , cytogenetic abnormality identify FISH , IgVH mutation status , etc ) relate response therapy arm independently . V : Arm B : To assess rate complete response use pentostatin , cyclophosphamide , ofatumumab induction follow ofatumumab consolidation patient previously untreated CLL SLL require therapy . VI : Arm B : To evaluate whether consolidation therapy ofatumumab PCO induction improve depth response . OUTLINE : Patients receive ofatumumab IV day 1-2 course 1 day 1 course 2-6 . Patients also receive pentostatin IV 30 minute day 1 , cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 , pegfilgrastim subcutaneously day 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients Arm B receive additional course single agent ofatumumab IV day 1 6 course ( course 7-12 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
