	<brief_title>Does Memantine Improve Verbal Memory Task Performance Subjects With Partial Epilepsy Memory Dysfunction ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients epilepsy frequently demonstrate subtle cognitive difficulty set otherwise normal intelligence . Those left temporal lobe seizure often particular deficit verbal memory ( Blum 2001 ) . These memory difficulty may distress aspect epilepsy patient . Unfortunately , treatment option memory dysfunction limit . Cognitive therapy , example , may help patient cope , treat memory loss address underlie pathologic process . Two study examine pharmacologic management memory dysfunction patient epilepsy use donepezil ( Aricept ) , inconsistent result questionable benefit . A pilot study Fisher et al . ( 2001 ) show promise use drug . The study find improved immediate recall consistent long-term retrieval score Buschke Selective Reminding Test three month open-label treatment compare pre-treatment baseline . A recent randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over trial donepezil , however , show effect memory measure delay recall Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( Hamberger et al . 2007 ) . Use donepezil , acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , may pose risk seizure exacerbation population . Fisher et al . ( 2001 ) report significant increase frequency generalize tonic-clonic seizure donepezil treatment . Cholinergic agent show cause seizures animal model well ( Turski et al . 1989 ) . Given isolated case report seizure associate donepezil use , manufacturer issue advisory note warn possible relationship , although data insufficient establish causality . While increase seizure note Hamberger et al . ( 2007 ) study , seizure exacerbation remain concern regard use drug patient epilepsy . The mechanism postulate effect donepezil unclear . Cholinergic transmission traditionally view contributor hippocampal pathology . It believe excitotoxicity , mediate glutamate act NMDA receptor hippocampus , cause hippocampal sclerosis . This process lead seizures memory dysfunction . Alteration excitotoxic pathway would novel , potentially safer effective , approach treatment memory loss . The possible effect intervention level excitotoxicity support animal data . Such study demonstrate induced seizure rat model epilepsy lead decrement performance spatial memory task , Morris water maze . This memory dysfunction , however , mitigate NMDA antagonist , MK-801 , administer prior seizure induction . The underlie concept NMDA receptor antagonist would block pathway excitotoxicity lead hippocampal injury memory loss ( Kelsey et al . 2000 ) . An NMDA antagonist , memantine ( Namenda ) , prescribed human treatment moderate severe Alzheimer 's disease ( Tariot et al . 2004 , Reisberg et al . 2003 , 2006 ) . Patients Alzheimer 's disease attain significant cognitive improvement use drug , measure Severe Impairment Battery . The time-course benefit less clear , study demonstrate sustained improvement ( Tariot et al . 2004 ) others show transient benefit first several week treatment ( Reisberg et al . 2003 ) . It unknown , however , NMDA antagonist memantine would benefit human memory dysfunction seizure . The propose study test hypothesis treatment memantine would improve verbal memory test performance patient localization-related epilepsy . If beneficial , would provide much-needed treatment option . The study examine primary specific aim : Aim 1 : Improvement memory test performance . The primary aim study evaluate efficacy memantine treatment verbal memory dysfunction subject leave temporal lobe epilepsy . We expect verbal memory task performance , measure Buschke Selective Reminding Test ( SRT ) , improve take memantine , take placebo . Such find would support use memantine treatment memory loss population , well generally support hypothesis NMDA receptor hyperactivity appropriate target intervention . The study examine two secondary specific aim : Aim 2 : Selectivity response . We propose postulated benefit memantine specific verbal memory subject leave temporal lobe seizure , visuospatial memory subject right temporal lobe seizure , rather represent overall improvement cognitive function . We expect improvement cognitive task either memantine placebo group , measure include Digit Span ( sustain attention , immediate span ) , Spatial Span ( visuospatial work memory span ) , Block Design ( visuospatial construction ) , Verbal Fluency , Design Fluency , Stroop Color Word Interference ( executive function ) test . This would lend support hypothesis blockade NMDA receptor hyperactivity hippocampus would lead improved performance cognitive task depend specifically integrity hippocampus , oppose general benefit overall cognition . Aim 3 : Improvement self-reported memory function . We evaluate whether subject localization-related epilepsy memory difficulty subjective improvement memory administration memantine . We expect improvement self-rated memory function Quality Life Epilepsy Patient Inventory ( QOLIE-89 ) memantine , change scale placebo . This measure serve evaluate hypothesis memantine treatment lead clinically meaningful improvement .</detailed_description>
