	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) associate high level low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol low level high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol . CVD result 'hardening artery ' build-up cholesterol wall blood vessel . LDL main carrier cholesterol body . LDL particles responsible transport cholesterol deposit vessel wall . LDL particle also alter structure turn irritant vessel wall . The body respond irritate effect LDL produce substance result inflammation . This sequence event eventually lead vessel become permanently damage . HDL protective role CVD . It associate enzyme paraoxonase protect body damaging effect alter LDL particle . Nicotinic acid ( niacin ) ability lower LDL level raise HDL level thus reduce incidence CVD . Our study aim show niacin good effect cholesterol level also able reduce inflammation . Niacin often poorly tolerate due flush side effect . Tredaptive formulation combine niacin laropiprant , agent reduces flush hence improve tolerability compliance . Patients receive cholesterol-lowering medication whose LDL level reach recommend target recruit study . The study conduct Manchester Royal Infirmary . The study two consecutive 16 week period . In period patient randomise either tredaptive placebo . They attend 5 monitoring visit . Apart first visit , fast blood sample take subsequent visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The design placebo-controlled cross-over study . The study 2 consecutive 16 week period . If patient satisfies inclusion/exclusion criterion consent participate study , he/she enter 4-week placebo run-in period . This follow 12-week treatment period patient assign tredaptive placebo randomly . At end treatment period patient enter second 4-week placebo period go onto second 12-week treatment period . Patients randomise placebo first treatment period receive tredaptive second treatment period vice versa . Thus participate patient receive active medication one treatment period study . Patients continue take statin duration study , ensure cholesterol-lowering benefit usual medication compromise . Patients recruit Lipid Clinic Manchester Royal Infirmary . The study explain fully patient time ask question . Information leaflet give patient encourage take least 1 day discuss study family , friends general practitioner consent . The study comprise 5 visit . At first visit , inform consent take patient . The visit also include history take physical examination . Subsequent visit take place end 4th 16th week . This repeat second 16 week period . Apart first visit , patient require give blood sample 50 ml visit . They ask fast overnight ( 22.00 hour ) day visit blood sample do midday follow day . Blood take experience doctor nurse risk involve may bruise puncture site .</detailed_description>
