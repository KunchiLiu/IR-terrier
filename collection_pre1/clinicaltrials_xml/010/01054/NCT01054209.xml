	<brief_summary>This study demonstrate whether electric warm mattress reduce number patient get cold shiver elective cesarean section . Peri-operative hypothermia ( body temperature 36 ÂºC ) cause post-operative complication patient discomfort . Immediately post-operatively discomfort due increase pain shivering . Patients say time recovery ward stressful prolong become cold ( hypothermic ) shiver . Subsequently , patient suffer increase risk infection delay discharge hospital . For patient ( baby ) Cesarean section important start breast feed soon possible , cold may delay . For type surgery measure put place stop patient become cold thereby reduce number problem . However case patient undergo Cesarean section special blanket hot air blown keep warm inappropriate mother give birth Cesarean section would make difficult mother good skin-to-skin contact new baby immediately delivery - important part bond process . A solution use new warm mattress . This show safe effective type surgery , test Cesarean section . In investigator study , investigator warm group patient undergo planned Cesarean section compare unwarmed group see difference primarily post-operative temperature . Secondarily , investigator also look difference total blood loss , incidence blood transfusion , wound infection , shiver , immediate health baby , time take become fit discharge recovery , length hospital stay time breast-feeding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project randomise control trial compare warm mattress current standard care ( warm ) . Prospective participant invite letter provide information booklet explain study right . Informed consent take writing . Patients randomise use protocol create Trusts Clinical Investigations Research Unit use Internet base randomisation system . The researcher blind logistically feasible . The statistician analysing result blind group receive warm . Study data collect manually standardise data collection sheet . All enrol patient temperature measure specified time observe shiver . Data collection require measure primary outcomes complete time discharge recovery room . Data collection secondary outcome prospective retrospective occur time anaesthesia one month procedure . All patient receive routine post-operative care . To ensure late complication miss interview patient phone one month date procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient undergo elective ( plan ) caesarean section spinal combine spinal epidural ( CSE ) anaesthesia eligible . Exclusion criterion refuse , unable fully understand trial 16 year age present Caesarean section . Those unable understand language issue exclude regret due difficulty obtain interpreter time caesarean section , recovery home telephone interview . Waiting additional interpretation may delay clinical management patient also patient may able convey question concern study mail , email telephone prior attend . Patients 16 year age exclude trial reason consent . Although patient le 16 year age may Gillick competence therefore capacity consent take part trial , minor parent may concern lead refuse trial entry . Child birth minor stressful patient , family clinical team keen add purpose study .</criteria>
