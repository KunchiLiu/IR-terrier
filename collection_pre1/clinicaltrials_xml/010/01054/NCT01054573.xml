	<brief_title>VX-950-TiDP24-C219 : A Roll Over Trial Patients Control Group C216 Study Who Received Telaprevir Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( i.e people involve know identity intervention ) , single-arm , roll-over trial telaprevir combination pegylated interferon ( Peg-IFN ) alfa-2a ribavirin ( RBV ) . The purpose trial provide access telaprevir patient randomize control group VX-950-TiDP24-C216 trial ( refer C216 trial hereafter ) fail therapy virologic reason . The efficacy , safety , tolerability telaprevir combination Peg IFN alfa 2a RBV evaluate . In addition , amino acid change baseline HCV NS3 ( i.e protein associate hepatitis C virus ) protease domain evaluate . The trial consist screen period approximately 28 day , 48-week treatment period , 24-week follow-up period . It expect approximately 120 patient could eligible enrollment . Since C216 trial blind patient reach Week 72 ( discontinue earlier ) , patient enter current trial upon invitation . The investigator receive invitation send unblinded independent virology monitor C216 trial patient C216 trial randomize control group fail therapy virologic reason . Next invitation , patient need fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion current trial order eligible participate . The screen visit current trial occur patient complete assessment C216 trial , include Safety Follow-up Visit . Patients must enter trial later 80 week first dose C216 trial . In current trial , patient receive 12 week telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hour ( q8h ) combination Peg-IFN alfa-2a RBV standard dos , i.e. , 180 microgram weekly 1,000 1,200 mg/day ( weight base ) , respectively , follow 36 week Peg IFN alfa 2a RBV standard dos . Patients hepatitis C virus RNA level &lt; 25 IU/mL undetectable end treatment ( Week 48 discontinue early ) follow 24 week last dose study medication ass sustain virologic response ( SVR ) . Safety/tolerability assessment perform adverse event ( AEs ) , regardless severity , collect continuously Safety Follow-up Visit , schedule 4 week last dose study medication . Thereafter , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) report . All patient receive 12 week telaprevir 750 mg q8h ( orally ) combination Peg-IFN alfa-2a RBV standard dos , i.e. , 180 microgram weekly ( injection ) 1,000 1,200 mg/day ( weight-based ) ( orally ) , respectively , follow 36 week Peg IFN alfa-2a RBV standard dos .</detailed_description>
