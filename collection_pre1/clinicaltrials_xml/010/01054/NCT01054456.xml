	<brief_title>A Multicenter , Open-Label , Single-Arm Evaluation Palonosetron Prevention Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea Vomiting ( CINV ) Subjects Who Have Experienced CINV ( Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea Vomiting ) During Previous Cycle Low Emetogenic Chemotherapy ( LEC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palonosetron currently approve prevention acute delay nausea vomit associate initial repeat chemotherapy induce nausea vomiting ( CINV ) cause moderate highly emetogenic chemotherapy . This study design assess safety efficacy palonesetron prevent CINV ( Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea Vomiting ) administer patient experience either vomit least moderate nausea last cycle low emetogenic chemotherapy . Palonosetron give intravenously approximately 30 minute prior start chemotherapy regimen . Efficacy safety include episode nausea , retch vomit assessed five 24 hour period start Day 1 end Day 6 patient diary . On Day 2 Day 6 FLIE ( Functional Living Index- Emesis ) assessment also complete order help evaluate patient 's quality life start chemotherapy cycle Day 6 .</detailed_description>
