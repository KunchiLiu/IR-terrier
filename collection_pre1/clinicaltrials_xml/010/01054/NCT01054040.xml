	<brief_summary>The study involve cardiac rehabilitation client measure weight , height , waist circumference blood pressure comparison first final visit ( 8 week ) . A control group receive usual care experimental group receive usual care plus portion control plate meal . Patients currently waist circumference , weight , height blood pressure measure first visit ( week 0 ) final visit ( week 8 ) . This study would compare three parameter time ( week 0 week 8 ) control experimental group . The control group would receive usual care experimental group would receive usual care plus give portion control plate week 0 . The hypothesis study subject experimental group average reduction : ( ) waist circumference &gt; 5 % , ( b ) weight BMI &gt; 5 % , ( c ) systolic diastolic blood pressure &gt; 10 % . The subject control group hypothesize show average less targets experimental group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Portion Plates Weight Loss Cardiac Rehabilitation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Canada , 6.8 million adult overweight additional 4.5 million obese , translate 58.3 % Canadian adult overweight obese . The overall cost obesity British Columbia ( 2006 ) estimate $ 563 million dollar . An increase food portion size sedentary lifestyle Canadians contribute imbalance caloric intake usage . Obesity lead risk factor many chronic disease link directly increase incidence heart disease hypertension . Cardiac Rehabilitation ( CR ) Phase I involve rehabilitation patient cardiac disease outpatient set Richmond Hospital . It 8-week interdisciplinary program involve exercise , group education , individual counselling . Currently , patient refer cardiologist CR program parameter like blood pressure waist circumference measure first final visit . Over past year , average change blood pressure first last day ( 8 week ) reduction 12.2 systolic blood pressure 3.1 diastolic blood pressure . The average waist circumference change 0.88 cm . Patients offer optional individual visit dietitian require attend weekly nutrition education class . Weight Loss Portion Plates Portion size essential determine amount calorie consume meal time . When large portion consume , great amount calorie ingest . The Canadian Community Health Survey ( 2004 ) find average adult consumed 2732 kilocalorie daily , increase average 2356 kilocalorie 1991 . One randomize control study look impact portion control tool ( portion plate ) weight change diabetic patient find significantly great weight loss patient use tool versus control group . No study find measure efficacy tool cardiac patient . Hypertension Weight Reduction Body mass index ( BMI ) common tool use compare height weight , calculate weight ( kg ) divide height square ( m² ) . A person acceptable body weight BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/ m² . Obesity define BMI 30 kg/ m² . Increased body weight high BMI risk factor hypertension . A reduction BMI non-pharmacological method like caloric reduction physical activity significantly improve cardiac risk factor study . Routine physical activity show reduce blood pressure . Studies blood pressure exercise show improvement 10-20 % . Systolic blood pressure reduce 1.6 mm Hg systolic 1.1 mm Hg diastolic every 1 kg weight lose overweight patient . Studies demonstrate reduction 100 mmol/day dietary sodium associate decline 5-7 mmHg/2.7 mmHg hypertensive subject . Based literature , experimental group hypothesize reduction 10 % systolic diastolic blood pressure ( systolic decrease 13 mm Hg , diastolic reduction 8 mm Hg ) versus &lt; 10 % reduction control group . Waist Circumference Weight Loss Waist circumference indicative increase risk disease , include coronary heart disease 88 cm woman 102 cm men . Reducing waist circumference weight loss lower person 's risk hypertension coronary heart disease . Using waist circumference combination BMI useful determine person 's health risk , especially person normal BMI high waist circumference . Elevations BMI waist circumference independent risk factor heart disease , increase heart disease risk factor 2-4 fold . Purpose Study : The purpose study determine use portion control tool ( portion plate ) could improve waist circumference , weight loss blood pressure patient within cardiac rehabilitation program . If tool show statistically improve outcome compare control group receive usual care , tool may add usual care patient long term . Objectives Research Question This randomize control study ask : How portion control plat impact weight , blood pressure waist circumference patient cardiac rehabilitation program ?</detailed_description>
