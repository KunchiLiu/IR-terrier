	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether NEC device effectively occlude intracranial aneurysm carotid/vertebrobasilar fistula maintain parent vessel patency</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurovascular Embolization Cover Treatment Intracranial Aneurysms Carotid/Vertebrobasilar Fistulae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAH ( subarachnoid hemorrhage ) devastate medical emergency . As many 60 % patient afflict die first 30 day result SAH , remain severely disabled bleed . Existing treatment option include : medical management ; endovascular therapy surgical therapy . Endovascular technique use detachable coil refine include stent serve prevent coil mass dislodging . Further improvement believe possible NEC create seal exclude aneurismal lumen blood flow without need coil . This study involve endovascular placement NEC across aneurysm neck order treat subset aneurysm without coil .</detailed_description>
