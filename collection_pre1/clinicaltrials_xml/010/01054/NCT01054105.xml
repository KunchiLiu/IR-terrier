	<brief_title>Effect BMPR-2 Gene Mutations Hemodynamic Response Iloprost Inhalation Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) consist group vascular abnormality elevate pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary vascular resistance . Idiopathic familial PAH progressive several year believe fatal without treatment . ( 1-2 ) The result Endothelin Antagonist tRial mildly symptomatic PAH ( EARLY ) indicate early diagnosis treatment PAH might improve time clinical worsen emphasize PAH need diagnose treat early stage . ( 3 ) Germline mutation bone morphogenetic protein receptor ( BMPR ) -2 , member transform growth factor ( TGF ) -β superfamily , find familial sporadic form idiopathic PAH , ( 4-6 ) appetite-suppressant PAH . ( 7 ) The BMPR-2 gene , chromosome 2q33 , 13 exon . Exons 1-3 encode extracellular domain , exon 4 encodes transmembrane domain , exon 5-11 serine/threonine kinase domain , exon 12 13 large intracellular C-terminus unknown function appear unique BMPR-2 . ( 8 ) Mutations familial PAH report exon except 5 13 . ( 9 ) About 10-25 % sporadic case idiopathic PAH think BMPR-2 mutation ( 10 ) rare case PAH associate congenital heart disease , connective tissue disease drug induce PAH report . ( 11-12 ) It likely genetic predisposition exist base normal variation gene may influence pulmonary circulation . However , study regard prevalence BMPR-2 gene mutation Korean patient perform . In previous study , family member familial PAH patient show increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure ( PASP ) rise exercise assess echocardiography . ( 13-14 ) In study , relatives idiopathic/familial PAH patient display enhanced frequency pulmonary hypertensive response exercise response associate mutation BMPR-2 gene . ( 15 ) These result suggest asymptomatic gene carrier , absence manifest pulmonary hypertension , might enhance PASP exercise risk develop rest pulmonary hypertension future compare patient without gene mutation . Therefore , treatment response variable vasodilator ( ex . calcium channel blocker , endothelin antagonist prostacyclin analogues.. ) may different base presence BMPR-2 gene . In present study , want investigate prevalence BMPR-2 gene mutation Korean PAH patient ( Step-I ) test PAH patient treat iloprost inhalation solution ( Ventavis® ) would show hemodynamic response , especially assessed exercise echocardiography ( Step-II ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient age 20 80 year 2 . Newly diagnose WHO category I PAH patient : Patients meet follow criterion within 3 month obtain right heart catheterization ( mean PAP 25 mm Hg rest mean pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ( PCWP ) leave ventricular enddiastolic pressure 15 mm Hg le ) echocardiography ( peak PAP 40mmHg mean PAP 30mmHg ) . 3 . Previously diagnose PAH patient refractory conventional treatment except iloprost inhalation solution ( Ventavis ) : Patients meet echo criterion ( peak PAP 40mmHg mean PAP 30mmHg ) treat PAH medication except iloprost inhalation solution ( Ventavis ) diagnose WHO Group 1 PAH base prior RHC data ( criterion ) refractory . 4 . The patient able undergo low intensity exercise test ( low dose bicycle walk ) 1 . The patient leave heart disease ( category II WHO classification pulmonary hypertension ) ; ex . Congestive HF , cardiomyopathy , significant valvular heart disease , significant arrhythmia , suspicious elevate PCWP . 2 . The patient category III , IV V WHO classification pulmonary hypertension : Pulmonary hypertension lung disease and/or hypoxemia Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Interstitial lung disease Sleep disorder breathe Alveolar hyperventilation disorder Chronic exposure high altitude Developmental abnormalities Pulmonary hypertension due chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease Thromboembolic obstruction proximal pulmonary artery Thromboembolic obstruction distal pulmonary artery Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism ( e.g . tumor parasitic ) Miscellaneous disorder affect pulmonary vasculature Patients contraindication Ventavis ; ( Hypersensitive Ventavis , High risk bleeding , increase use Ventavis ( e.g . active peptic ulcer , trauma , intracranial hemorrhage ) Severe coronary disease Unstable angina History Acute myocardial infarction within 6 month Uncompensated heart failure close medical monitoring Severe arrhythmia Suspected pulmonary congestion Cerebrovascular disease within 3 month ( e.g . transient ischemic attack , stoke ) Pulmonary hypertension due venous occlusive disease , valvular defect dysfunction cardiac muscle , independent pulmonary hypertension ) Pregnancy Women high probability pregnancy Breast feeding Renal failure ( creatinine clearance : le 30mL/min ) 3 . The patient concurrently use pulmonary vasodilator ( ex . Inhaled NO , endothelin antagonist ) except PDE5 inhibitor 4 . The patient poor echo window unavailable accept echo data 5 . The patient exercise 6 . The patient change medication administer ventavis treatment 7 . The patient allergic reaction ventavis 8 . The patient systemic disease ( ex . Leukemia , MM , Sickle cell anemia , significant liver disease )</criteria>
