	<brief_title>Study Single Agent Lenalidomide Older Adults With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary : Patients start study drug , lenalidomide Day 1 , Cycle 1 . Lenalidomide capsule take orally ( mouth ) . If patient 's disease progress 2 cycle therapy , low dose dexamethasone add . If patient 's disease stable 2 cycle therapy , use alternate corticosteroid ( prednisone ) add lenalidomide therapy receiving . Dexamethasone prednisone tablet form take orally ( mouth ) . However , patient minimal response additional 2 cycle lenalidomide therapy , therapy continue disease progress . See intervention description detail .</detailed_description>
