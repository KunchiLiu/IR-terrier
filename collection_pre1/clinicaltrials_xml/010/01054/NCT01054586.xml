	<brief_summary>APV10017 pharmacokinetic study evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability fosamprenavir/ritonavir ( FPV/RTV ) reduce dos 14 day HIV-infected subject mild moderate hepatic impairment ( HI ) . Based data , two new regimen recently approve EMEA FDA patient group ; FPV 700mg BID/RTV 100mg QD mild HI ( Child-Pugh score 4-6 ) FPV 450mg BID/RTV 100mg QD moderate HI ( Child Pugh score 7-9 ) . The Committee Medicinal Products Human Use ( CHMP ) request longer-term safety data among hepatically impair HIV-infected population receive recently update FPV/RTV dose regimen . An observational cohort study conduct use routinely collect data three European HIV patient cohort high proportion hepatitis co-infected individual . Patients receive FPV/RTV follow address follow objective . Primary : To assess safety tolerability FPV/RTV-based ART subject mild moderate hepatic impairment . Secondary : A ) . To compare safety tolerability FPV/RTV-based ART subject mild moderate hepatic impairment compare FPV/RTV-based ART hepatitis B ( HBV ) hepatitis C ( HCV ) co-infected subject normal hepatic function . B ) . To compare safety tolerability FPV/RTV-based ART lopinavir/ritonavir LPV/RTV-based ART subject mild moderate hepatic impairment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV infect patient without hepatic impairment coinfected HBV HCV start FPV/RTVbased therapy January 1 , 2008 . The FPV/RTV expose patient stratify four group analysis ( see intervention AD label/description ) , accord degree baseline hepatic impairment , define accord FPV/RTV dose receive ( APRI score intervention A D ) . The LPV/RTV intervention group must start therapy approve standard dos January 1 , 2008 . Receipt FPV/RTV LPV/RTV within year precede baseline visit .</criteria>
