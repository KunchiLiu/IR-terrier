	<detailed_description>PURPOSE Rationale : Placing stent esophagus may relieve dysphagia cause inoperable esophageal cancer rapidly improve quality life . But recurrence neoplastic stricture remain challenge solitary stent placement . Brachytherapy option palliation symptom due esophageal stricture , however , relieve dysphagia rapidly . So novel esophageal stent load 125I seed combine advantage immediate relief esophageal dysphagia stent placement radiation therapy brachytherapy . Purpose : A small-sample unicentric clinical trial author ' institute certificate novel esophageal stent load 125I seed intraluminal brachytherapy relieve dysphagia cause advanced esophageal cancer rapidly improve quality life . This multicentric randomized clinical trial study novel esophageal stent load 125I seed see well work compare conventional covered stent patient malignant dysphagia cause advanced esophageal cancer . OUTLINE : This multicentric , randomize , control study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo placement novel esophageal stent load 125I seed day 1 . - Arm II : Patients undergo placement conventional covered stent day 1 . - Health-related quality life assess baseline , I , 3 6 month . Condition : Esophageal Cancer Intervention ( Procedure ) : Esophageal stent placement , dysphagia score , complication therapy , survival time therapy Phase : Ⅲ DISEASE AND PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Criteria Inclusion Criteria : - Endoscopically histologically confirm cancer esophagus , - Progressive dysphagia cause esophageal cancer , dysphagia grade level Ⅲ level Ⅳ [ STOOLER stand ] , - In barium meal esophagus , severe stricture cancer make barium difficult pas superior normal esophagus broaden , - The bulk shape oesophageal cancer display CT three-dimensional reconstruction , - Patients clear consciousness，Cooperation，ECOG performance status 0,1 3 , - Informed consent : authorization signature . Exclusion Criteria : - Poor general status , ECOG performance status 4 , - Dysphagia cause esophageal cancer , - Noncooperation authorization signature . - The superior border cancer high seventh cervical vertebra - Ulcerative esophageal carcinoma - Esophageal fistula , - WBC le 3000/mm3 - Severe hepatic inadequacy renal inadequacy , Exit Termination Criteria : Patient Exit : - Patient ask exit actively , - Patient collaborate relative test effect date collection , - Receiving therapy without permission , , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , etc. , - Occurring disease severe complication simultaneously make patient need rescue immediately effect trial . Termination : - Severe safety question , follow-up death stent insertion , - Severe lapsus trial design lead ro difficulty efficacy evaluation stent , - Severe bias practice trial lead ro difficulty efficacy evaluation equipment . Case exfoliation : Definition : participant sign entered trial insist end.The reason may : - The participant cooperate design test receive therapy without permission , - The participant exfoliate trial follow-up lost , - Severe adverse reaction , event complication make participant keep treatment . Exfoliation handle : - Inquest reason supply date telephone follow-up visiting , - Corresponding method adapt handle adverse reaction , adverse event complication , - Store primitive date exfoliate participant full analysis set（FAS）statistics . Case rejection : - Misdiagnosis wrong enrollment , - Consistent exclusion criterion , - No test record , - Can evaluate efficacy receive therapy without permission , Any reject case supply reason quit curative effect statistical analysis.However , record treat least one time include adverse reaction analysis . RANDOMIZATION Trial design : - Multicentre : patient come sixteen hospital disseminate China , - Completely randomized：Number completely randomize form depend SAS statistic software administer sponsor , every collaborator apply number participant enrol choose treatment arm accord random number . - Single Blind : participant unaware treatment take - Active Control : treatment arm . Arm I : patient undergo placement novel esophageal stent load 125I seed . Arm II : patient undergo placement conventional cover stent . - Sample estimation : It demonstrate preclinical trial median survival time advanced esophageal cancer patient self-expandable esophageal radiation stent insertion 7 , conventional cover stent insertion 4 m. Considering enrollment time 3 ( T1 0.25y ) , whole trial time 1.5y.and α 0.05 ( test two-sided ) 0.10 ( test one-sided），the least sample number 152.If exfoliated case consider , least sample number 186 ( increase 20 percent ) . Case diffusion Be send one two arm accord random number randomize formed SAS statistic software . Radiation dose estimation : After balloon dilation ( special balloon producted esophageal dilation Nanjing MicroInvasive Medical , Nanjing , China ) participant [ balloon diameter 16mm superior segment esophagus 18mm midpiece inferior segment esophagus ] , CT scan esophagus balloon performed.Then image send Treatment Planning System ( TPS , Nanjing MicroInvasive Medical , Nanjing , China ) , bulk oesophageal cancer calculate accord CT three-dimensional reconstruction images.At last , radiation dose estimate ( radioactivity 0.7mCi accord preclinical study ) . Choice stent seed fixation : The esophageal irradiation stent combine self-expandable covered esophageal stent ( MTN ; Nanjing MicroInvasive Medical , Nanjing , China ) load ( load ) 125I radiative seed ( CIAE-6711 ; Chinese Atomic Energy Science Institution , Beijing , China ) chose.The diameter varies 16 18mm ( 16mm superior segment esophagus 18mm midpiece inferior segment esophagus ) , length length disease additional 20mm . The seed ( number decide accord radiation dose estimate advance ) fix around stent , cover superior inferior border cancer ( distance seed vary 10mm 15mm distance seed inlet/outlet less than10mm ) . Post-operation Care Participants lie back waist raise stent insertion , common treatment include hemostasis , infection prevention , mucous membrane esophagus stomach protection.No cold diet , except eat fluid slowly . Follow-up Calling visiting patient every month test insertion . Objectives : [ Time Frame : Follow-up interval 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month stent placement ] Primary : - Overall survival - Median Survival Secondary - Quality life [ ECOG performance status ] - Dysphagia grade [ STOOLER stand ] - Change oesophageal cancer [ RECIST standard ] - Restenosis degree [ esophagus visualization ] - Pathologic change cancer , - Successful rate stent placement , Safety - Immune function ( IgA , IgG , IgM , CD3 , CD4 , CD4/CD8 ) - Myelosuppression - Distribution attenuation isotope [ ECT PET ] - Adverse event [ CTCAE v3.0 standard ] Determine individual rate complication associate type esophageal stent patient . Statistical analysis : All primal date store completely precisely submit special date administrator time Internet.Before enter date special database two people independent , submit data must review , verified ensure accuracy , currency ( accord primal date ) . Statistical analysis software SAS 9.0 adapt . Test two-sided , P ≤0.05 , significant difference . Mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , median , maximum minimum value use describe measurement data two group ; rank sum test use valuate relief dysphagia ; log-rank test use compare survival curve two group draw Kaplan-meier method.At last median survival obtain compare test rank sum test . Constituent ratio use describe numeration data two group ; u test use valuate difference survival rate ; reason restenosis analyse Fisher ` exact test chi-square ( X2 ) test . The balance-analyses fundament data ( population data others ) : test chi-square ( X2 ) test chose . Esophageal Cancer PURPOSE Rationale : Placing stent esophagus may relieve dysphagia cause inoperable esophageal cancer rapidly improve quality life . But recurrence neoplastic stricture remain challenge solitary stent placement . Brachytherapy option palliation symptom due esophageal stricture , however , relieve dysphagia rapidly . So novel esophageal stent load 125I seed combine advantage immediate relief esophageal dysphagia stent placement radiation therapy brachytherapy . Purpose : A small-sample unicentric clinical trial author ' institute certificate novel esophageal stent load 125I seed intraluminal brachytherapy relieve dysphagia cause advanced esophageal cancer rapidly improve quality life .
