B ) Phase 2 : To determine whether addition high-dose lenalidomide ASCT follow maintenance standard-dose lenalidomide improves response rate duration response relapse multiple myeloma ( RMM ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm relapse , primary refractory , relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Patients must measurable disease define International Uniform Response Criteria , define follow : serum Mprotein &gt; = 500mg/dL urine Mprotein &gt; = 200mg/ 24 hour involve free light chain &gt; = 10mg/dL provide serum free light chain ratio abnormal Patients must receive least one prior line therapy . Age &gt; = 18 year . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status &gt; = 2 . All study participant must register mandatory RevAssist program , willing able comply requirement RevAssist . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : ANC &gt; = 1,000/uL platelet &gt; = 50,000/uL total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 X upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 2.5 X upper limit normal Cardiac Ejection Fraction &gt; = 45 % Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min Patients must adequate number CD34+ stem cell collect allow transplantation . This number define â‰¥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cell / kg body weight . If previously collect store , patient must willing undergo stem cell mobilization collection per standard practice . The effect lenalidomide develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown ; however , show teratogenic primate . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 day within 24 hour prior prescribe lenalidomide ( prescription must fill within 7 day ) must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . The treat physician follow adverse reporting guideline outline detail pregnancy . Lenalidomide show carry risk thromboembolic event , especially use combination either corticosteroid alkylating chemotherapeutic agent . All patient participate study must willing able tolerate prophylactic anticoagulation lowmolecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) require date treatment protocol . Patients also must able tolerate lowdose aspirin , 81 mg daily , maintenance phase treatment protocol . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients myeloma therapy within 14 day prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Patients may receive bisphosphonate therapy part routine myeloma care time prior study entry . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition lenalidomide ( include thalidomide ) melphalan . Known positive HIV infectious hepatitis , type B C. Uncontrolled illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study risk unborn fetus potential risk nurse infant unknown . History thrombosis thromboembolic event within last 60 day prior study entry .</criteria>
