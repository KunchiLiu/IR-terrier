	<brief_summary>The investigator try investigate benefit early administration ( immediately urethral catheter removal ) sildenafil nerve-sparing RALP 3 month . The investigator compare potency rate 2 year nerve-sparing RALP men on- demand sildenafil 100mg dose early postoperative period ( immediately urethral catheter removal ) delay postoperative period ( 3 month RP ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Various study use animal model CN neuroparaxia clinical trial demonstrate somewhat beneficial effect PDE-5 inhibitor smooth muscle cell corpus cavernosum . PDE-5 inhibitor include sildenafil demonstrate effectiveness management postprostatectomy ED . In animal experiment , PDE-5 inhibitor lower severity fibrosis corpus cavernosum rat CN cut . In clinical trial , on-demand dose routine dose PDE-5 inhibitor improve potency rate men receive NSRP , improvement potency rate appear statistically different among two dose regimen . But , study potency rate accord start time administration PDE-5 inhibitor ( eg . early vs. delay post-operative dosing ) . At present , conclusive whether nerve-sparing RALP provide high potency rate conventional surgery men prostate cancer . But , precise dissection CN , robotic surgery appear chance maintain potency men receive RP .</detailed_description>
