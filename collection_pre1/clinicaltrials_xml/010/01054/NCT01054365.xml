	<brief_title>Same Day Discharge After Coronary Stenting Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single center prospective , randomize , non-inferiority study four-hundred patient stable unstable angina ( CCS class I-IV ) , type A , B , C lesion ( ) , single multivessel disease undergo single multivessel coronary artery stenting . All patient screen consented prior coronary artery stenting procedure . All patient receive oral bolus thienopyridine pre-treatment immediately stent implantation . All patient anticoagulated bilvalirudin heparin procedure . Common femoral angiography perform end procedure via side-arm sheath ipsilateral oblique view ( 20-40Â° ) . In patient visible atherosclerotic disease small common femoral artery angiography size and/or degree stenosis measure quantitative angiography . Hemostasis femoral-arteriotomy access site facilitate deployment hemostatic closure device ( StarClose ProGlide ) . Patients screen consented prior cardiac catheterization . If stenting procedure perform without complication hemostatic closure device successfully deploy patient evaluate four hour completion procedure ; complication patient able ambulate , he/she randomize enrolled either early discharge group ( EDG ) delay discharge group ( DDG ) . Subjects consider enrol study successfully randomize either EDG DDG group . Patients early discharge group ( EDG , n=200 ) dismiss hospital six hour hemostatic closure device deployment vital sign stable , bleeding complication present , ambulatory , electrocardiographic change suggestive myocardial ischemia and/or arrhythmia free chest pain . Patients delayed discharge group ( DDG , n=200 ) dismiss hospital procedure discretion attend cardiologist sooner 24 hour PCI . Patients indication extend hospital stay discharge regardless randomization . A detailed screening log keep track number patient screen consented include reason screening failure ( exclusion criterion , procedure related complication , closure device failure , access complication , chest pain , arrhythmia , hemodynamic instability , etc .</detailed_description>
