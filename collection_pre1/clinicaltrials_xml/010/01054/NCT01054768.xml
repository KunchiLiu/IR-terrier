	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether alpha-lipoic acid acetyl-L-carnitine low systemic inflammation patient Sickle Cell Disease reduce oxidative stress , result decrease frequency vaso-occlusive pain episode improve quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antioxidant Therapy Reduce Inflammation Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People sickle cell disease inflammation ( response body tissues injury irritation ) people without sickle cell disease . This inflammation measure blood check level protein call CRP well change see blood due inflammation ( change platelet cell ) . There even inflammation sickle-related complication ( like pain acute chest syndrome ) . We want test inflammation people sickle cell disease reduce use antioxidant compound . Antioxidants nutrient ( certain vitamin , mineral enzyme ) counteract effect oxidative stress arise free radical cell . The formation free radical normal cell process , uncontrolled oxidative stress cause problem u . One harmful problem inflammation . We know research study antioxidants help condition related inflammation . In study antioxidant test combination alpha-lipoic acid acetyl-L-carnitine , natural part many food eat need cell make energy food .</detailed_description>
