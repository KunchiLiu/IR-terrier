	<brief_summary>Currently technique produce thin ( 0.004-0.01 mm ) serial section large fresh tissue specimens suitable high-resolution situ protein/gene expression study without ice artifact fixation-induced molecular damage . Traditional frozen section preserve protein nucleic acid structure , inherent ice artifact precludes reconstruction protein mRNA expression pattern 3-dimensions . Since limitation exist section technique result fact rely mechanical cut turn require tissue stiff , suggest new approach cut tissue via electro erosion process utilizes focus radio frequency ( RF ) .</brief_summary>
