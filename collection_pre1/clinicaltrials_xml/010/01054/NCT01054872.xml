	<brief_title>Examining Role Genetics Determining Immune Response HIV Vaccine HIV-Uninfected Adult Twins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genetics may play role immune response HIV vaccine . It remain unknown , however , exactly genetic influence immune response may . This study examine gene affect strength immune response produce HIV vaccine gene influence different immune response . In study , participant receive two HIV vaccines—a DNA HIV vaccine ( VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP ) recombinant adenoviral serotype 5 ( rAd5 ) vector HIV vaccine ( HIVADV014-00-VP ) . Both vaccine experimental , use previous clinical trial without serious side effect . Comparing immunological response HIV vaccine trial complicate various genetic environmental factor . This study enroll pair twin grow common childhood environment . This provide researcher participant similar background role genetics examine control environmental variable . The purpose study examine gene may influence immune response DNA HIV vaccine follow rAd5 HIV vaccine . This study enroll pair healthy , HIV-uninfected monozygotic dizygotic adult twin . Participants receive DNA vaccine baseline Months 1 2 , rAd5 vaccine Month 6 . Both vaccine inject upper arm . At vaccination study visit , participant undergo medical history medication history review , physical exam , blood collection . Participants also complete questionnaire social impact assessment . They receive counsel HIV testing , risk reduction , pregnancy prevention . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic least 30 minute observation monitor side effect . For 3 day vaccination , participant record temperature side effect symptom log . In addition vaccine study visit , additional study visit occur Weeks 2 , 6 , 10 ; 1 , 3 , 7 day Month 6 visit ; Months 7 , 9 , 12 , 18 . Various study procedure , include physical exam , blood collection , counseling , repeat visit . At end 18 month , participant contact study researcher year 3 ½ year follow-up health monitoring .</detailed_description>
