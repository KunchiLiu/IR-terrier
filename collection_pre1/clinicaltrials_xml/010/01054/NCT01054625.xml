	<brief_summary>This study support current future Zalutumumab study increase Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) knowledge drug . PK study drug absorbed ( take ) , distribute ( move around ) , metabolise ( break ) excrete ( remove ) body , relation time . The first PK trial go 8 mg/kg , , indication PK profile high low dos different , need evaluate . Furthermore , need PK data dose 16mg/kg . The aim study therefore evaluate PK profile different dos Zalutumumab amount drug blood different time point single multiple dos . The result study , combine data complete ongoing Zalutumumab study , enable u provide patient effective treatment option may significantly prolong survival and/or improve quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zalutumumab Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck ( SCCHN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study look Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Zalutumumab patient Head Neck Cancer . 26 participant treat study drug Zalutumumab 4 different dos . Zalutumumab give day 0 , day 14 , day 21 day 28 . Blood sample ( PK check participant 's safety ) take drug give . Blood sample PK take directly drug give treatment visit also +3hr +12hrs day 0 day 28 may require overnight stay . Blood sample PK also take day treatment . After treatment day 28 , eight blood sample take 3 week . On day 49 participant may enter optional extended treatment period receive drug weekly longer appropriate participant ( doctor/participant decision cancer advance ) . Dosing extended treatment period start 16mg/kg . The correct dose participant check visit look presence severity skin rash . This common side effect medicine like Zalutumumab block Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor . The severity skin rash use guide dose . A mild rash could mean medication need , severe rash mean participant need break medication . End study 8 week last dose Zalutumumab blood sample take +4weeks +8weeks last dose drug .</detailed_description>
