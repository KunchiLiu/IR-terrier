	<brief_title>A Single Multiple Dose Study Explore Safety JNJ-38224342 Healthy Patients Patients With Seasonal Allergies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A four-part , single multiple dose study investigate safety JNJ-38224342 versus placebo healthy patient patient seasonal allergy . Volunteers ( patient ) randomly assign one four treatment group Parts . Part 1 2 randomize ( study drug assign chance ) double-blind ( neither physician volunteer know identity assign drug ) . In Part 1 patient receive single oral dose either 25 , 100 , 300 , 600 , 1250 2000 mg JNJ-38224342 placebo .

Part 3 ( male volunteer ) open-label ( people involve know identity assign drug ) , 2-period crossover ( mean volunteer receive treatment different time ) study effect food JNJ-38224342 . Participants give single 100 mg oral dose ( either solution capsule formulation ) . Part 4 patient seasonal allergy . The dose JNJ-38224342 determine base information collect Parts 1 - 3 . Patients participate part 4 study also nasal passage flush salt water content collect . Patients ask remain clinic either 5 day 18 day depend part study participate . A physical exam perform medical history collect . Safety evaluation include adverse event monitoring , blood pressure measurement , ECG lab work require blood urine sample various time point throughout study .
