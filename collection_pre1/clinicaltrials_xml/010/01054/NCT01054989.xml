	<brief_summary>The combination impair insulin sensitivity insulin secretion think basis type 2 diabetes . Increased free fatty acid level impair insulin action muscle liver , also systemic inflammation process play role development insulin resistance . This study compare effect fat inflammation insulin sensitivity , systemic inflammation , energy metabolism , vascular system neural function healthy human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A dysregulation lipid metabolism increase level free fatty acid ( FFA ) know represent one key mechanism pathophysiology insulin resistance , subsequently know basis development type 2 diabetes . But also inflammatory process , also know subclinical inflammation , show independently associate insulin resistance diabetes development . The aim study analyse causal relationship FFA inflammation induction insulin resistance healthy human . It known parenteral application lipid 4-6 hour result increase FFA subsequent induction transient insulin resistance peripheral tissue . Whether oral fat intake similar effect still unknown . On hand oral intake high fat meal acutely increase intestinal permeability thereby level bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) bloodstream . LPS known potent stimulator immune response subclinical level accompany elevated level immune mediator , turn impair insulin receptor signal pathway lead insulin resistance . Thus , study effect fat , oral parenteral fat load , short-term LPS-infusion simulate postprandial systemic LPS peak compare control infusion ( glycerol ) insulin resistance analyse . Insulin resistance hepatic glucose production determine hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp include glucose tracer . To detect effect immune system different level , measure 1 ) circulating level immune mediator ELISA bead-based mulitiplex assay , 2 ) gene expression leukocyte , 3 ) subfractions circulate leukocyte FACS 4 ) stimulatory capacity isolate lymphocytes monocyte vitro . Moreover , effect fat inflammation function autonomic nervous system vasculature study . A second focus impact intervention signal transduction mitochondrial function muscle well metabolism inflammation subcutaneous adipose tissue muscle fat biopsy .</detailed_description>
