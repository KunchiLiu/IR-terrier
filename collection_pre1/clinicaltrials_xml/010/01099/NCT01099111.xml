	<brief_summary>This clinical trial hypothesize Gut Microbiota ( bacteria , virus , fungi ) play major role occurrence progression many chronic gastrointestinal disease like Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Colo-Rectal Cancer . Hence , aim study spectrum microbiota patient compare normal subject , utilize metagenomic technique rather cultural method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The term intestinal `` microflora '' `` microbiota '' refer microbial ecosystem colonize gastrointestinal tract . Recently develop molecular biology instrument suggest substantial part bacterial community within human gut still describe . Intestinal bacteria play essential role development homeostasis immune system . Most important microbiota unculturable significantly limited understand bacterial-host crosstalk . Among method design gain access physiology genetics uncultured organism , metagenomics , genomic analysis population microorganism , emerge powerful technology . Metagenomics study genomic content complex mixture microorganism . Direct isolation genomic DNA environment circumvents culture organism study . The two primary goal approach develop consensus population microorganisms present identify role microorganism within specific environment . Metagenomics sample find nearly everywhere , include several microenvironments within human gut , soil sample , extreme environment deep mine various layer within ocean . Therefore , diversity microorganism think range hundred million great ten trillion specie . Among mysterious microenvironment human gastrointestinal tract harbor great thousand million microbial specie ( least 1014 ) , include 2000 specie dominate anaerobic bacteria . Many gastrointestinal even disease ( metabolic obesity , autoimmune allergy ) involve primarily human gut microbiota accord specific change microbiota equilibrium certain effect occur either bowel motility ( irritable bowel syndrome : IBS ) , homeostasis GI immune system ( inflammatory bowel disease : IBD ) , mucosal cell proliferation ( adenoma - colorectal cancer : CRC ) . These chronic disease affect nation worldwide represent significant public health burden . They see among child , adolescent , adult . Currently medical cure IBS , IBD CRC develop . The complex interaction microbial , genetic , immune , environmental factor seem play important role pathogenesis IBS , IBD CRC . Lately , post infectious - IBS gain increase focus , extent whole pathogenesis IBS might attribute specific trigger factor microbiota imbalance . The prevail theory IBD relate alter mucosal barrier deregulate immune response direct specific modification normal microbiota lead alteration equilibrium . The etiology IBD therefore conceptualize aberrant immunologic response modify component component gut microbiota potentially follow environmental insult . Likewise , CRC development process normal mucosal surface adenoma finally CRC ; probably relate gut microbiota . The prevalence disease document go obvious increase Saudi Arabia last 3 decade . This would represent unique model study role GIT microbiota metagenomics modification response environmental dietary factor community go urbanization fairly recently , analyze causative relation focus disease . Here , propose perform comprehensive analysis gastrointestinal tract microbiota contribution gut homeostasis normal subject patient IBS , IBD CRC use state art metagenomics technology . This do Saudi population sample believe represent unique model . Our specific objective project : - Characterize microbiota composition ( microbes virus ) mucosa Saudi patient IBS , IBD CRC . - Characterize mobile GI metagenomics Saudi patient IBS , IBD CRC . - Compare metagenomics IBS , IBD CRC patient normal subject population . Expected outcomes Significance research : Altogether , result aim 1 2 provide first time comprehensive in-depth analysis mucosa-associated microbiota adult patient IBS , IBD CRC Saudi population . The propose study define microbiota `` fingerprint '' Saudi norm , IBS , IBD CRC . The contribution virome mobile metagenome disease development and/or health maintenance assess first time thus potential reveal new paradigm . In addition , study virome mobile metagenome help u understand selective force could contribute alteration evolution microbiota community thus could important implication treatment disease . Certainly , work propose pave way toward future hypothesis-driven research could lead design therapeutic strategy aim manipulate microbial community .</detailed_description>
