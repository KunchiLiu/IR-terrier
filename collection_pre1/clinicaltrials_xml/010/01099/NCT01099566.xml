	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis still carry high mortality rate despite advantage intensive care medicine antimicrobial therapy . The inflammatory procoagulant host response infection intricately link interaction platelet , leukocytes endothelium play central role pathogenesis septic shock disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) . Interestingly , one key player cell coagulation , i.e . platelet , somewhat neglected position pathogenesis coagulation abnormality sepsis . However , thienopyridines , irreversible platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist , e.g . prasugrel , could potentially provide beneficial anticoagulatory antiinflammatory effect : P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist reduce TF-induced coagulation activation various ex vivo vitro model . Moreover , various line evidence indicate thienopyridines may block platelet leukocyte interaction thereby reduce propagation coagulation inflammation process . LPS-infusion healthy volunteer provide standardized model safely study non overt DIC document possible effect therapeutic prophylactic intervention . The investigator hypothesize thienopyridines , irreversible platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist , may blunt TF-triggered coagulation activation human , study TF-dependent coagulation model human .</brief_summary>
