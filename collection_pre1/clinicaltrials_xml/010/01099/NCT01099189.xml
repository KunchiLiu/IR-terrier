	<brief_summary>Patients whose kidney fail need receive dialysis treatment , commonly dialysis machine . In order connect machine operation often perform join artery vein arm . This form know arteriovenous fistula . The fistula cause increase flow blood vein vein react become big thicker , make easy connect patient machine . The success rate operation relatively low approximately 65 every 100 operation still work year . It think one factor may cause problem fistula ability vein stretch response increase blood flow . Previous research show vein kidney failure patient look different people whose kidney work view microscope . The investigator aim study structure vein use make fistula microscope also test engineering laboratory see much stretch . The investigator hope gain information structure vein ability stretch help determine vein affect well work part fistula . This information may help surgeon select best possible vein give patient give best chance work fistula future .</brief_summary>
