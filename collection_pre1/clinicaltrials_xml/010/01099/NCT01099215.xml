	<brief_title>Study PVS-10200 Treatment Restenosis Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease ( TRIUMPH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label dose escalation safety study PVS-10200 30 subject peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) require balloon angioplasty stent placement superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) . The study complete sequentially two dose cohort 10 subject ( low dose group , Cohort A ) 20 subject ( high dose group , Cohort B ) . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) conduct regular safety review . Each subject receive one treatment PVS-10200 deliver ultrasound guided injection perivascular region ( external vessel ) stented target lesion . The treatment administer within 24 hour balloon angioplasty/stent placement .</detailed_description>
