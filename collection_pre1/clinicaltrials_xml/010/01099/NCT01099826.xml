	<brief_title>Increasing Colorectal Cancer ( CRC ) Screening In Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular screening reduces morbidity mortality colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Screening rate , however , remain low suggest need innovative research design increase screen behavior . The purpose study compare effectiveness two intervention ( Tailored Health Communication [ THC ] Motivational Interviewing [ MI ] ) increase CRC screen behavior . Both intervention base strong conceptual framework derive Health Belief Model ( HBM ) Transtheoretical Model ( TTM ) , allow u explore underlie mechanisms intervention impact behavior change . The primary aim study compare CRC screen test use among 804 participant randomly allocate control intervention condition ; participant recruit two site ( Chicago , IL , Nashville , TN ) . The 3 study group receive ( 1 ) standard care , ( 2 ) tailor health communication , ( 3 ) motivational interviewing . Eligibility criterion study participant include 50 year old , CRC , average moderate risk CRC . Study participant survey telephone CRC-related belief pre-intervention ( Time 1 ) , 1 month postintervention ( Time 2 ) , 6 month postintervention ( Times 3 4 , respectively ) . Dichotomous behavioral outcome ( screen test ) stag CRC screen test adoption ( base TTM ) assess , well sociodemographic belief predictor screen behavior . Binomial multinomial logistic regression model use evaluate screen test use stage test adoption . Sociodemographic belief variable use covariates , intervention group primary independent predictor . Descriptive statistic ANOVA employ assess intervention difference amenable belief . Path ( mediation ) analysis perform explore underlying mechanism THC MI may differentially affect CRC screen behavior .</detailed_description>
