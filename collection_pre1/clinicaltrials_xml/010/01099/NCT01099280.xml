	<brief_summary>Prelabor rupture membrane ( PROM ) commonly define rupture membrane onset labor occur 8 % term pregnancy . A prolonged interval rupture membrane delivery associate increase incidence chorioamnionitis neonatal sepsis . The management term patient PROM , especially unfavorable cervix , remain controversial . Management option choose immediate induction labor versus delayed induction expectant management . Several report detail increase maternal neonatal morbidity expectant management , whereas active management lead short interval PROM delivery , reduce risk postnatal infection . In addition , active management preferred patient . The investigator know , neonatal intensive care admission , variable deceleration , primary cesarean delivery rate positively correlate long admission-to-labor-onset interval woman PROM . So , reduce induction delivery time , concurrent oxytocin infusion dinoprostone vaginal pessary use labor induction woman PROM may beneficial . Several study show short induction-to-delivery interval concurrent oxytocin infusion prostaglandin agent initiation labor . However , study , paucity information PROM labor induction . Only one randomize control trial compare efficacy concurrent dinoprostone oxytocin oxytocin alone woman term PROM . This study indicate concurrent vaginal dinoprostone intravenous oxytocin confer advantage intravenous oxytocin alone outcomes interest , include length labor patient satisfaction risk cesarean delivery . Unfortunately , study limit small sample size . The aim randomize study compare two protocol ( oxytocin vs. sustained-release dinoprostone follow six hour later oxytocin ) induction labour woman PROM term unfavorable cervix .</brief_summary>
