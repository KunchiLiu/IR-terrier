	<brief_summary>Arbovirus term use refer group viruses transmit blood-feeding arthropod . The word arbovirus acronym ( Arthropod-Borne virus ) . There hundred show cause disease human . The incubation period short usually limit 1 15 day . Among case symptom appear , common clinical feature infection 4 : algo-eruptive ( dengue , chikungunya , Zika virus disease ... ) , hemorrhagic fever ( dengue , yellow fever , Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever ) , neurological ( West Nile virus disease , Zika virus disease , Japanese encephalitis . ) arthritic affliction , ( Chikungunya , O'nyong nyong… ) . Dengue mosquito-born viral disease cause four different serotypes dengue virus ( DENV ) . Dengue fever ( DF ) define sudden onset fever associate non specific constitutional symptom , recovery occur spontaneously three seven day . The infection sometimes progress dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) , disease characterize transient increase vascular permeability provoke plasma leakage syndrome . DHF complicate shock internal hemorrhage . Other rarer potentially life-threatening complication include encephalitis , hepatitis , rhabdomyolysis , myocarditis . There currently way predict outcome DF DHF , World Health Organisation ( WHO ) classification lack sufficient sensitivity specificity recognize guide management severe form dengue . The pathophysiology severe form also poorly know , involve host characteristic ( immunological facilitation case new infection different serotype , genetic factor ) , viral factor . . Since early 2000s , French West Indies French Guiana become hyperendemic dengue , simultaneous circulation four serotypes , regular large outbreak , severe dengue include fatality . Chikungunya re-emerging alphavirus cause massive epidemic Africa , Indian Ocean , Southeast Asia . The first autochthonous case chikungunya describe French Antilles November 2013 . The disease typically consist acute illness like dengue fever , characterize abrupt onset high-grade fever , follow constitutional symptom , poly-arthritis skin involvement . Usually , illness resolve within à week : four six week . However , severe clinical form early stage ( encephalopathy , exacerbation previous complaints.. ) may appear chronic form incapacitate arthralgia affect 40 60 % patient confirm chikungunya . In France , others arbovirus may cause severe emerge re-emerging infectious disease like Zika West Nile . In non-immunized population emerge disease may cause outbreak specific severe clinical complication arbovirus ( polyradiculoneuritis Zika virus infection , encephalitis West Nile virus infection… ) West Indies- French Guiana French interministerial mission emerge infectious disease , coordinate Professor Antoine Flahault , recommend study underlined excellent situation Guyana type study , interface clinical basic research . This epidemiological situation call large prospective multicenter cohort study characterize severe form arbovirus infection , seek predictive factor , investigate pathophysiology disease .</brief_summary>

Secondary objective To identify demographic , clinical , biological , virologic , immunologic genetic factor predictive alter quality life confirm acute arbovirus infection . Onset specific complication : - Hemorrhagic fever ( dengue : WHO criteria.. ) - Neurological disorder ( West Nile virus infection , Zika virus infection , Japanese encephalitis… ) - Chronic chikungunya ( persistent musculoskeletal symptom three month symptom onset )</detailed_description>
