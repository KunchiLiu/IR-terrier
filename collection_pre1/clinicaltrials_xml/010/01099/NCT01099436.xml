	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , docetaxel , zoledronic acid , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective give together zoledronic acid treat patient breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give doxorubicin hydrochloride together cyclophosphamide docetaxel see well work without zoledronic acid treat patient large resectable locally advanced breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy ( TAC ) With Without Zoledronic Acid Treating HER2-negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine value neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , docetaxel without zoledronic acid patient HER2-negative large resectable locally advanced breast cancer . Secondary - To correlate clinical response pathological response treatment arm . - To evaluate disease-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - To evaluate safety tolerability add zoledronic acid neoadjuvant chemotherapy . - To evaluate heterogeneity ER/PR HER2 measurement core biopsy surgical specimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , cyclophosphamide IV , docetaxel IV day 1 . Patients also receive zoledronic acid IV 15 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , cyclophosphamide IV , docetaxel IV arm I . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
