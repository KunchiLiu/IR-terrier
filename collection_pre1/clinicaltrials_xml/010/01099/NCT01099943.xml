	<brief_summary>Hypotheses Specific Aims : The continued emergence antibiotic-resistance outpatient set underline need responsibly manage antimicrobial prescribing . It context seek test effective strategy reduce inappropriate use antibiotic primary care office practice . Our overall objective identify effective efficient strategy decrease contribution primary care clinician emergence antimicrobial-resistant bacteria community disseminate widely strategy find effective sustainable . We hypothesize implementation clinician decision support system , active education component , reduce inappropriate use antibiotic primary care office practice . Our hypothesis base premise inappropriate prescribe result multiple factor include difficulty distinguish benign , self-limited viral infection serious bacterial infection ; overdiagnosis bacterial infection case clinical uncertainty true nature illness ; constraint time available clinician explain patient nature illness reason antibiotic indicate . The focus proposal compare impact clinical decision support active education intervention enhance appropriate use antimicrobial common outpatient infection . In randomized control trial , primary care provider participate intervention arm receive active education couple implementation clinical decision support tool , provider control arm intervention . At end study , provider control arm receive thorough analysis antibiotic prescribing pattern suggest opportunity improvement , well access intervention tool study end . Our interdisciplinary team integrate novel method implementation science clinical laboratory expertise infectious disease , antimicrobial stewardship , primary care , information technology , performance improvement , health service research , biostatistics . The Specific Aims construct validate hypothesis primary care set demonstrate two result intervention strategy : 1 . Reduced use antibiotic treat condition drug know effective 2 . Decreased prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotic treat common bacterial infection . The degree impact term prescription per 100 visit target outpatient infection compare active education clinical decision support versus intervention . The study able measure value clinical decision support active education inform future effort disseminate outpatient antibiotic stewardship intervention .</brief_summary>
