	<brief_summary>This project propose measure delay admission Intensive Care ( ICU ) . Delays United Kingdom NHS widely report possibly few ICU bed many develop health care system . Patients inevitably admit severe illness . Scores measure severity use research benchmarking . However , although patient deteriorate time , severity probably neither directly linearly relate duration illness . Instead likely characteristic severity change time . In sepsis good biological evidence early pro-inflammatory stage follow later change metabolic , neuroendocrine , immune system . In addition examine effect duration illness prior ICU admission , investigator also therefore investigate severity change time . SPOT ( Light ) prospective observational study . Treatment modify anyway . Patients evaluate ward critical care outreach team , subsequently admit critical care eligible . Severity illness time initial evaluation eventual admission compare , effect duration illness 90 day survival investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It useful consider time critical illness two perspective . The first begin logically onset pathology . With exception condition myocardial infarction trauma moment mark classic symptom external event , define time zero difficult . For reason , organisational frame reference , hospital admission time referral specialist team , commonly use . Delay follow organisational time important often modifiable factor regard delivery health care . However , pathophysiological timing remain relevant disease process dynamic ( part hypothesis study ) determine phenotype disease particular moment . This project propose measure delay admission Intensive Care ( ICU ) use organisational pathophysiological timing . Delays United Kingdom NHS widely report { McQuillan:1998p127 , Hillman:2001p90 } possibly few ICU bed many develop health care system . { Wunsch:2008p121 } We intend measure chronological time moment patient 'referred assessed require Critical Care ' , actual time admission . We determine often delay occur , whether affect outcome . Requirements critical care , however , absolute . Importantly , assessment prospective patient make isolation . If ICU bed already fully occupy , decision maker must organise transfer another unit ( risks patient ) , organise premature discharge another patient , defer admission . We also therefore consider deferment alongside delay , impact survival . In addition , project consider pathophysiological timing . This particular importance sepsis current biological model suggest phase response infection . { Riedemann:2003p82 } In case , possible patient admit critical care different phase disease ; moreover , phase may clinically relevant affect response treatment . pathophysiological delay estimate use concept illness trajectory ( also may biological correlate ) { Osuchowski:2006p2107 } . This mean patient slowly deteriorate likely ill longer . In word , pathophysiological time zero early another patient rapidly deteriorate . This illness trajectory estimate measure change severity illness ward assessment ICU admission . The effect illness trajectory , therefore pathophysiological timing ICU admission , evaluate particular attention severe sepsis .</detailed_description>
