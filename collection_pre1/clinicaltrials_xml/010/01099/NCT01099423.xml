	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving sunitinib malate surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving sunitinib malate surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether undergo immediate surgery surgery sunitinib malate effective treating patient metastatic kidney cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study immediate surgery see well work compare surgery sunitinib malate treat patient metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Surgery Surgery After Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine immediate versus defer nephrectomy effect disease control patient resectable , synchronous , metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat sunitinib malate . - To identify potential response criterion base histopathology molecular research tumor tissue . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord WHO performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , number metastatic site ( 1 vs 2 ) , institution . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( immediate nephrectomy ) : Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy . Beginning 4 week surgery , patient receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment sunitinib malate repeat every 6 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( deferred nephrectomy ) : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . About 1 day completion sunitinib malate , patient undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient undergo tumor tissue collection baseline time surgery ass possible difference gene expression . Patients also undergo blood sample collection periodically evaluate potential impact serum proteins clinical outcome . Samples store future study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
