	<brief_summary>The study examine potential biological genetic mechanism lead hiatal paraesophageal hernia formation predispose individual . It expect patient defect normal production maturation collagen connective tissue protein , thus lead weakness diaphragm may allow spontaneous herniation . Comparison tissue blood sample patient ( study group ) make individual undergo low esophageal surgery develop concurrent hernia ( i.e . esophageal myotomy achalasia laparoscopic gastric bypass laparoscopic adjustable gastric band morbid obesity - control group ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diaphragmatic herniation common medical problem characterize protrusion abdominal viscera directly ( 95 % case ) , adjacent ( 5 % case ) , esophageal hiatus . Individuals suffer so-called hiatal paraesophageal hernia experience symptom regurgitation , heartburn , early satiety , extreme case , respiratory compromise visceral strangulation ischemia . Unless hernia small , symptom generally refractory medical management require surgical correction , approximately 40,000 antireflux surgery perform year United States . The hernia repair procedure , may perform either laparoscopic open fashion , involve reduction intrathoracic viscera back abdominal cavity closure diaphragmatic defect . Generally , closure hernia accomplish primarily , use nonabsorbable suture approximate edge defect . Unfortunately , recurrence rate type repair unacceptably high range 10-40 % . Furthermore , instance particularly large hernia , edge defect may far apart primarily bring together , necessitate use strategy relax incision patch bridge gap . Although precise recurrence rate complex repair clear , expect even higher diaphragmatic hernia close primarily . The genetic biologic factor predispose individual form hernia well understood . Several small series suggest ventral inguinal hernia formation may due weakness abdominal wall , possibly secondary defect collagen deposition metabolism . Certain study show high ratio Type III collagen ( immature ) Type I collagen ( mature ) , protein mRNA level , patient abdominal hernia compare without . Furthermore , report indicate difference level mature collagen might due underlie difference ion expression certain matrix metalloproteinase ( MMPs ) , largely responsible collagen remodel . MMPs -1 , -2 , -3 , -9 , -13 show upregulated connective tissue injury , alteration MMP-2 fibrillar collagen interfere normal wound healing . Furthermore , Bellon et . al . show overexpression MMP-2 fibroblast patient direct inguinal hernia , Zheng 's group detect MMP-13 overexpression tissue sample patient recurrent inguinal hernia . So far , study address role collagen deposition MMPs formation hiatal paraesophageal hernia . Preliminary work institution , however , show great 50 % reduction elastin content phrenoesophageal gastrohepatic ligament ( `` PEL '' `` GHL '' , respectively ) patient hiatal hernia compare without herniation . Additionally , elastic fiber PEL GHL frequently display fragmentation distortion despite lack visible inflammatory response . ( J.A . Curci N.J. Soper , unpublished result ) Nevertheless , neither early work , study outside institution look way screen patient ( i.e . via blood sample ) detect high risk hernia occurrence . Currently , new MMP-inhibitory drug study method potentially block slow development MMP-dependent condition abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . Along line , patient genetic/biologic predisposition hernia formation could readily identify , present potential point medical intervention prevent future hernia development . Research procedure : Patients enrol study standard referral group primary care physician specialist feel surgical correction diaphragmatic hernia achalasia necessary . Additionally , patient refer practice weight reduction surgery also consider eligible enrollment . Consent participate study occur time consent surgical procedure obtain PI attend surgeon within minimally invasive surgery group . This occur surgeon 's office/clinic , hospital patient in-house consult , several day week prior schedule surgery . Following informed consent process , patient appropriately place either study control group . At time surgery ( hernia repair , bariatric procedure , esophageal myotomy ) , 30 ml venous blood sample drawn store later test analysis . The appropriate standard surgical procedure perform per surgical attending judgment , however , operation , small ( approximately 1 cm2 ) piece tissue excise 3 anatomic site : 1 ) leave diaphragmatic crus , 2 ) PEL , 3 ) GHL . After removal abdomen , tissue sample divide 2 piece set aside test late time . This excised sample represent minute amount tissue compare overall size diaphragmatic crus surround ligamentous attachment , removal expect cause foreseeable problem patient . In fact , hiatal hernia repair often necessitate dissection much large crural connective tissue piece order obtain complete reduction abdominal viscera chest subsequent closure hernia defect . Following removal small tissue sample , hernia repair , esophageal myotomy , gastric bypass/banding complete standard fashion . Inclusion Criteria : Any patient undergoing paraesophageal hernia repair , esophageal myotomy , laparoscopic gastric bypass , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding .
