	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease major cause mortality worldwide responsible one three global death . A main characteristic cardiovascular disease impair blood flow formation blood clot . Platelets clot-forming cell responsible prevention bleeding . However , disease condition may overly activate , promote blood clot blockage blood vessel . Consumption diet rich fruit vegetable decrease mortality cardiovascular disease number mechanism , include prevention platelet clot aggregation . There evidence suggest platelet aggregation may modulate group compound know flavan-3-ols , find various food , especially cocoa . However , mechanisms compound affect platelet function yet fully understood . We design human study assess mechanism flavan-3-ols cocoa beneficially affect platelet function platelet proteome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) primary cause premature death worldwide , incidence rate United Kingdom , particularly Scotland , amongst high worldwide . Thus identification dietary component effectively prevent CVD potentially wide public health benefit . Consumption diet rich plant-based product protect development CVD . Such effect ascribe part polyphenols , non-nutritive , potentially bioactive secondary metabolite ubiquitous find fruit , vegetable , herb , spice , teas wine . The beneficial effect polyphenols CVD believe mediate , least part , though improve platelet function . At least 10 human intervention study find consistent robust beneficial effect cocoa product platelet function , unfortunately study use one two method assess platelet function , therefore get limited insight complex physiological behavior platelet . In addition , none study assess potential mechanism flavan-3-ols may inhibit platelet function . Schramm et al . show consumption chocolate rich flavan-3-ols oligomers ( procyanidins ) lead increase production prostacyclin , strong platelet inhibitor . This finding also observe aortic endothelial cell treat procyanidins vitro . Thus stimulation prostacyclin production endothelial cell may reflect one pathway flavan-3-ols indirectly inhibit platelet activation . Many potential mechanism discuss literature far evidence mechanism limit non-existing . In study assess effect consumption chocolate enrich flavan-3-ols platelet function measure platelet aggregation , also vitro coagulation platelet activation healthy human . In addition , examine effect consumption flavan-3-ols regulation platelet proteome elucidate pathway bioactive cocoa compound affect platelet function . HYPOTHESIS Acute consumption moderate amount dark chocolate enrich flavan-3-ols result decrease platelet activation aggregation decreasing level thromboxane A2 produce endothelial cell . OBJECTIVES The main objective propose study determine whether consumption 60 g dark chocolate enrich flavan-3-ols result decrease platelet activation aggregation decreasing level thromboxane A2 , well assess mechanism could involve . The specific objective propose study determine : 1. whether acute intake 60 g dark chocolate enrich flavan-3-ols , compare standard dark chocolate low flavan-3-ols white chocolate contain flavan-3-ols , affect platelet aggregation , thromboxane A2 formation upon aggregation , vitro bleed time , P-selectin expression , activation fibrinogen receptor ; 2. whether acute intake 60 g dark chocolate enrich flavan-3-ols , compare standard dark chocolate white chocolate , affect platelet proteome , thereby potential new biomarkers platelet function , well protein level anti-oxidant enzyme ; 3. identity concentration flavan-3-ols metabolite plasma and/ urine 2 6 h acute intake 60 g dark chocolate enrich flavan-3-ols , compare standard dark chocolate white chocolate .</detailed_description>
