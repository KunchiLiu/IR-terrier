	<brief_title>Endotrol-tracheal Tube Assisted Endotracheal Intubation During Video Laryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction laryngoscope clinical anesthesia practice , innovator anesthesia attempt improve upon perfect design laryngoscope blade . The goal innovation improve visualization laryngeal structure increase likelihood successful tracheal intubation . Unfortunately , despite modification , occasionally intubation trachea accomplish facility , even patient anatomy predict difficult intubation . It estimate endotracheal intubation perform 8 million patient per year United States . Of endotracheal intubation , approximately 80 % perform direct laryngoscopy transoral placement endotracheal tube ( ET ) trachea . There fairly uniform report incidence fail intubation literature ; occur approximately 0.05 % 1:2230 surgical patient approximately 0.13 % 0.35 % , 1:750 1:280 , obstetric patients.1,2 The incidence unsuspected difficult intubation estimate high 3 % . One factor contribute difficult intubation poor visualization airway . Video laryngoscopes relatively new edition armamentarium airway device available airway manager . Although instrument expensive traditional direct laryngoscope , offer several advantage may justify expense . Although clinician may espouse routine use video laryngoscopy , provider reserve anticipate difficult situation `` plan B '' fail intubation direct laryngoscopy ( DL ) . There several advantage video intubation technique compare direct laryngoscopy . The video laryngoscopes show provide superior view traditional laryngoscopy well difficult intubations.3-5 Video intubation technique , allow tracheal intubation monitoring , show improve safety procedure increase intubation success . If laryngeal manipulation require improve visualization laryngeal structure , intubator person assist coordinate movement observe , simultaneously , image video display . In contrast , use conventional laryngoscopy , anesthesiologists `` keyhole '' view airway structure ; view may obscure attempt pass ET . McGrath video laryngoscope design provide clear view vocal cord intubation little change laryngoscope technique , simplify intubation difficult airway , less traumatic minimize lift force require intubation6 . The device consist laryngoscope handle modify provide video image airway structure screen , conveniently locate directly front anesthesiologist . The device extremely easy learn use anesthesiologist familiar use Macintosh blade . GlideScope design optimize visualization present operator enlarge video image airway structure . The GlideScope consist digital camera , call video baton , fit plastic laryngoscope blade light source side provide video image airway structure screen , conveniently locate directly front anesthesiologist . The GlideScope show provide superior view traditional laryngoscopy potentially advantageous direct laryngoscopy difficult intubations.7 The GlideRite rigid stylet conforms GlideScope blade angulation , , eliminate need manually shape stylet fit airway improves maneuverability endotracheal tube placement . The GlideRite rigid stylet work GlideScope system reduce patient trauma . It reusable clean easily use autoclave . It note several report publish describe trauma upper airway ( anterior tonsillar pillar , soft palate ) intubation video laryngoscopes.9-14 This risk underscore importance maintain direct visual contact , blade ET initially insert oral cavity past uvula . Recently , several report use endoflex15-17 tube ( similar endotrol tube ) show considerable usefulness normal direct laryngoscopy video laryngoscopy ( use glidescope ) well . The purpose study compare safety efficacy Endotrol Tube ( Covidien , Colorado , USA ) compare conventional endotracheal tube conjunction GlideRite stylet videolaryngoscopy assist endotracheal intubation . INSTRUMENTS : McGrath Video Laryngoscope ( MVL ) - A video-based system tracheal intubation utilize video camera embed `` camera stick '' . A disposable transparent sterile blade cover camera stick , easily adjust position use simple ratchet mechanism . The result video image display small color Liquid Crystal Display ( LCD ) attach top handle device , adjust obtain best view . The unit power single easily-replaced AA battery feature single electronic control : on/off switch locate top unit . The device available adjustable curve MAC blade ( size 3 5 ) . Also , device feature sterile disposable transparent blade sheath prevent cross infection . The unit use much manner conventional laryngoscope exception introduce mouth centimeter , attention direct LCD display . There usually need lift force . It easy use , even patient ordinarily difficult intubate `` anterior larynx '' . This ease use base fact direct line sight need establish get good view glottis MVL employed . As image transfer LCD display , anesthesiologists able view key anatomical landmark early possible time , facilitate navigation . Also , case require external laryngeal manipulation , assistant see effect maneuver monitor simultaneously anesthesiologist quicker , efficient intubation . GlideScope Video Laryngoscope ( GVL ) - The GlideScope commercially introduce 2001 . The 1- piece handle blade make medical- grade plastic . It vertical profile 14.5 mm , midblade bend 50-60 degree , video camera light-emitting diode house toward distal end blade . The image capture camera transfer attach cable color liquid crystal display ( LCD ) . A heating element cover camera lens ensures effective antifogging device turn 15- 30 second . The blade sterilize reuse , available 3 size : large ( adult ) , midsize ( pediatric ) , small ( neonatal ) . More recent version GlideScope include Ranger , Compact , battery- base portable unit ; Cobalt , feature reusable internal video baton placement within large ( adult ) small ( pediatric ) disposable blade . Use GlideScope require styletted tube facilitate tracheal tube passage , either regular ( e. g. , Satin-Slip ) stylet dedicate GlideScope rigid stylet , preform conform shape scope blade ; equally effective.18 As image transfer LCD display , anesthesiologists able view key anatomical landmark early possible time , facilitate navigation . Also , case require external laryngeal manipulation , assistant see effect maneuver monitor simultaneously anesthesiologist quicker , efficient intubation . Endotrol Tracheal Tube ( ETT ) ( Covidien , Colorado , USA ) - A sterile , single lumen , disposable ET built- flex mechanism standard 15 mm connector . The tube provide directional tip control via operator- activated ring loop incorporate self- seal valve attach pilot balloon . The ETT specifically design use case difficult intubation aid directional tip control . Due Hi-Lo cuff design , ETT acceptable oral/nasal intubation trachea anesthesia case intubation duration expect 24 hour unpredictable . The special way hold ETT place thumb right hand end 15 mm connector index finger ring loop . Pulling ring loop cause tip turn anteriorly towards tracheal opening . Several report publish describe trauma upper airway ( anterior tonsillar pillar , soft palate ) video laryngoscope guide intubation use styletted tracheal tube.9-14 We believe Endotrol tacheal tube ( Covidien , Colorado , USA ) may safer alternative styletted tracheal tube regard upper airway injury . GlideRite Stylet- The GlideRite rigid stylet make stainless steel . It design use endotracheal tube 6mm large . It reusable 250 time 1 year easy clean sterilize autoclave . The angle GlideRite rigid stylet complement unique GlideScope angle , , eliminate need manually shape stylet fit airway , improve maneuverability , facilitate quick placement endotracheal tube . The GlideRite rigid stylet work GlideScope system reduce patient trauma . METHODOLOGY : A . General Study Design- The study include total 60 patient . Patients randomize 2 group 2 subgroup group , computer generate randomization schedule . Patients group A ( N= 30 ) intubate use MVL patient group B ( N= 30 ) intubate use GVL . Patients group divide 2 subgroup . Group A ( N= 30 ) - Subgroup A1 ( N=15 ) - Patients intubated use Endotrol Tracheal Tube without stylet ( Covidien , Colorado , USA ) . Subgroup A2 ( N= 15 ) - Patients intubated use styletted endotracheal tube Gliderite ( Teleflex Medical , Hudson RCI/ Sheridan/ HBT ) . Group B ( N= 30 ) - Subgroup B1 ( N=15 ) - Patients intubated use Endotrol Tracheal Tube without stylet ( Covidien , Colorado , USA ) . . Subgroup B2 ( N= 15 ) - Patients intubated use styletted endotracheal tube Gliderite ( Teleflex Medical , Hudson RCI/ Sheridan/ HBT ) . In operating room , standard monitoring device apply include pulse oximeter , 3 lead ( least ) , ECG blood pressure cuff ; latter could invasive non-invasive depend nature surgery . Baseline measure BP , pulse , oxygen saturation , CO2 , make . The time noted sedation anesthesia administer . Vital sign record every minute time induction anesthesia begin five minute patient intubate , five-minute interval thereafter fifteen minute . General anesthesia induce bolus administration propofol ( 2mg/kg ) fentanyl ( 1mcg/kg ) , maintain inhalational agent . Rocuronium ( 0.6 mg/kg ) administer provide muscle relaxation mixture sevoflurane isoflurane nitrous oxide utilized maintenance anesthesia ability mask ventilate confirm . The lung mechanically ventilate semi-closed circle system maintain end-tidal CO2 near 35 mmHg . Patients ' lung ventilate via anesthesia mask 100 % oxygen patient completely relax . All investigator train base manufacturer recommendation resident perform least 3 intubation McGrath laryngoscope 3 intubation Cobalt GlideScope ( total 6 intubation ) prior enlist patient study . The CA-2 CA-3 resident perform intubation . The external neck pressure may apply assistant attempt improve exposure larynx . The ease intubation record term number attempt ( measure either reinsertion blade endotracheal tube ) intubation time ( time laryngoscope blade enters mouth 1st capnograph breath ) record . If 2 attempt need , third attempt make device use group . If still unsuccessful , direct laryngoscopy/ flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy perform intubate trachea case deem failure . The subjective level difficulty ( 0 = Extremely Easy 5 = Extremely Difficult ) performance intubation also record . An alternative technique use case intubation fails . 1 . Use Glideride stylet use Endotrol tracheal tube , Endotrol tracheal tube able get towards cord . 2 . Use regular stylet instead Glideride especially McGrath Glideride able help intubation 3 . Use macintosh miller appropriate blade styletted Endotrol tube intubation videolaryngoscope difficult 4 . Use LMA similar device case intubation difficult previous device application difficult airway protocol . B. Measurements- We record morphometric characteristic patient . The quality airway evaluate use Mallampati Wilson score system , thyromental scoring system Patil , interincisor gap distance , neck mobility sternomental distance .
