	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PLAN / BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Tumors originate neuroendocrine system , although relatively rare , may life threaten . In case disease metastasize , 5 year survival poor . 131I meta-iodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) 90Y DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-Octreotide ( DOTATOC ) two radiopharmaceutical show promise therapeutic agent patient metastatic neuroendocrine tumor . However , deliver sufficient radiation dose tumor obtain objective anti-tumor response cure radiopharmaceutical challenge allowable dose limit impose radiation damage normal tissue . Organ biodistribution kinetics 90Y DOTATOC 131I MIBG substantially different , lead different critical organ agent , kidney Y90Y DOTATOC red marrow 131I MIBG . We propose investigate mechanism increase radiation dose deliver tumor without exceed `` critical '' radiation dose normal organ combine 90Y DOTATOC 131I MIBG . AIMS / OBJECTIVES : The primary aim project determine , fraction individual neuroendocrine tumor would show substantially improve tumor dosimetry combine agent therapy compare `` best '' single agent therapy determine magnitude potential tumor radiation dose increase . METHODS : To achieve , plan perform serial scintigraphic imaging procedure measure patient specific bone marrow , kidney , tumor biodistribution kinetics 111In Pentetreotide 131I-MIBG adult child neuroendocrine tumor . Then , use program already develop , input individual dosimetry measure bone marrow , kidney tumor determine optimal amount administer radioactivity combination 131I MIBG plus 90Y DOTATOC 131I MIBG alone .</detailed_description>
