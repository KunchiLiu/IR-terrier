	<brief_title>Asthma Disparities Latino Children : Acculturation , Illness Representations &amp; CAM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Racial ethnic disparity asthma health outcome increase United States . These disparity strike researcher public health official issue call action understand occur . Compared non-minority child , minority child use controller medication less often , less continuity care , visit emergency department frequently . Especially noteworthy increase prevalence asthma among Latino ( primarily Puerto Rican ) child . Individuals Mexican Puerto Rican origin constitute 73 % Latino population U.S. although two group share similar historical origin cultural value , significant heterogeneity exists . Researchers tend study Latinos single group recent descriptive asthma research confirm difference among Latino subgroup related prevalence , mortality morbidity , illness belief , asthma healthcare practice . Puerto Rican child exhibit high rate asthma prevalence mortality among ethnic group Mexican child low rate . Asthma disproportionately affect Puerto Rican child : adjust odds ratio lifetime diagnosis compare non-Latino white child 2.33 . Genetic , environmental , healthcare system provider factor totally explain difference outcome two group . Not well examined role culture , acculturation , illness representation ( way parent interpret health illness influence he/she manage child 's asthma ) may play parent ' asthma treatment decision ultimately , child 's asthma control . Parental illness representation may account difference use complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) , inhaled oral corticosteroid , leukotriene antagonist observe Puerto Rican Mexican family . Acculturation may also play role asthma health outcome . Less-acculturated Mexican family , even know risk factor poor health outcome , good outcome acculturated family . Emerging evidence suggest acculturation opposite effect Puerto Rican versus Mexican child asthma . U.S. birthplace high acculturation among Mexican child associate great risk asthma wheeze , high acculturation may protective Puerto Rican child term diagnosis asthma medication adherence . The past three decade see shift approach study health illness behavior disease-oriented medical model integrate bio-psycho-social model . The factor lead asthma health disparity Mexican Puerto Rican child complex well understood . Illness representation , associate treatment decision ( CAM controller medication use ) , influence acculturation process , three factor require additional scrutiny . The Common Sense Model Illness Representation integrate model take account environmental , social , cultural factor well patient ' belief health illness . Because parent gatekeeper child 's healthcare ultimately make final treatment decision , parent ' representation child 's illness influence treatment decision child 's asthma health outcome . Before develop intervention target asthma health disparity among diverse group Latino family , necessary gain thorough understanding interaction individual characteristic , cultural experiential factor , social-environmental context , healthcare system factor . The investigator also need examine interaction factor impact parent ' illness representation , use CAM controller medication , child 's asthma health outcomes . This innovative study move research descriptive study individual construct contexts test integrate , multi-factorial model . Targeted intervention , aim reshape illness representation , develop implement integrate family 's ethnomedical belief system ( medical system base cultural belief specific ethnic group ) biomedical model . The propose interdisciplinary multi-level study address gap evidence base expand framework assess disparity asthma health outcome among Latino child . This one-year longitudinal , multi-site study among sample Mexican Puerto Rican parent child age 5-12 asthma . This age range select child age group typically assume daily control manage asthma . The finding study contribute knowledge base similarity difference exist Mexican Puerto Rican family regard asthma illness beliefs management strategy , acculturation influence factor . Healthcare provider , regardless practice setting , best treat child asthma understand belief parent hold cause asthma , nature asthma symptom , course action ( chronic versus episodic ) , medication alternative therapy use treatment , expectation symptom resolution . If parent ' belief discordant HCPs ' belief address devise management plan , increase risk nonadherence . Healthcare provider would also well educate CAM therapy parent use treat child 's asthma . By , take lead elicit information CAM use contact parent ensure safety therapy use , educate parent advantage disadvantage individual CAM therapy , provide culturally competent care , improve adherence prescribe medication regimen . If parent feel part decision-making process regard treatment child 's asthma , may likely adhere prescribed medication regimen . Healthcare provider opportunity intervene individual level effect change aim improve adherence prescribe treatment regimen improve communication , education ( parent ) , partnership family . THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK : A presentation theoretical underpinnings conceptual model study present provide framework discussion literature review . The Common Sense Model ( CSM ) Illness Representation provide theoretical framework investigate disparity asthma control pathways parental IR use CAM controller medication . The model describe cognitive processing system include situational stimulus ( perception child 's symptom ) , objective representation health threat ( illness representation ) treatment decision ( CAM controller medication use ) appraisal outcome ( asthma control ) success failure treatment decision . The model contain feedback loop IRs potentially change time parent gain experience manage child 's asthma . The three tenet model parent active problem solver ; IR central cognitive construct drive parent ' treatment decision appraisal outcomes ; IRs individualize may agreement medical fact . The process IR , treatment decision , appraisal outcome shape parent 's prior history manage child 's asthma , personality trait , social cultural context . The social cultural context individual life play important role illness representation two way : '' 1 ) culture provide label categorize events/symptoms define illness ensures culturally common view give disease illness ; 2 ) culture provide social personal contact parent use construct IR also develop action plan cop disease threat . '' Prior experience child 's asthma management generates store memory success failure choose treatment strategy , influence parent perceive child 's symptoms current episode treatment decision . There five distinct attribute illness representation : 1. identity - disease label somatic symptom parent associate disease . 2. cause - parent 's ideas cause disease . 3. consequence - parent 's perceive short long term effect disease , physical , social , emotional , economic consequence disease . 4. time-line - parent 's expectation disease duration : acute , chronic , episodic/cyclical . 5. controllability - parent 's idea cure recovery either action medical intervention . DESIGN : This longitudinal study parental illness representation CAM controller medication use among diverse sample 300 Latino family ( primarily Mexican Puerto Rican ) child asthma age 5-12 . This age range select child age group typically assume daily control manage asthma . We use structured interview parent , conduct short interview child , obtain objective measure lung function child , review child 's medical record . Interviews child assessment conduct five time period : enrollment , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month enrollment , total data collection period 12 month . This assessment schedule allow u capture seasonal variation child 's asthma symptom well conform recommendation NAEPP child daily controller medication follow-up visit every 3 month . Medical record abstraction take place 12-month follow-up . Figure 1 . Conceptual framework propose relationship Sample Setting : To ensure diverse representation Latino family healthcare setting , sample recruit two school-based health clinic one clinical practice site Phoenix , AZ , two inner-city hospital asthma clinic Bronx , NY . A multisite study warrant neither site alone sufficient number Mexican Puerto Rican family conduct research independently . It also preferable interview assessment conduct simultaneously among two population minimize seasonal variation asthma symptom severity control maximize standardization survey administration across time sample . Approximately 300 family recruit enrol asthma/allergy general pediatric clinic ER Jacobi Medical Center North Central Bronx Hospital ( N= 150 ) , Phoenix Children 's Hospital Breathmobile ( N= 75 ) , two school-based health clinic Phoenix ( N= 75 ) . These clinical partner site provide adequate population inner-city , poor Mexican Puerto Rican child asthma recruit study sample , thus anticipate problem recruit enrol 300 family . Prescreening : Approximately 400 parent child asthma age 5-12 year old invited participate study meet eligibility criterion . Our previous research study yield refusal rate range 15 % 30 % . We assume conservative 20 % refusal rate , yield approximately 300 family agree participate study . Eligibility criterion : ) The child must 5 12 year age , b ) diagnosis asthma ( describe ) obtain child 's medical record , c ) family Latino ( English Spanish speaking ) self-identified primary caregiver , ) child significant pulmonary condition ( e.g. , cystic fibrosis ) , e ) participate parent primary least equal responsibility day-to-day management child 's asthma , f ) cognitive learn disability could interfere parent 's child 's ( determined parent ' report ) ability comprehend interview question . All recruitment sit computerized data system allow participant identification diagnosis , age , ethnicity . If documentation diagnosis asthma find medical record asthma suspect , potential participant offer appointment bronchodilator test child . Prior test date , potential participant instruct withhold short-acting β2- agonist medication ( e.g. , albuterol ) , caffeine , medicine drink contain methylxanthines ( e.g. , root beer ) , long-acting bronchodilator medication ( e.g. , salmeterol , formoterol ) , combination agent ( e.g. , Advair , Symbicort ) 24 hour . Herbal preparation ( e.g. , kanpo , ding chan tang ) over-the-counter medication ( e.g. , Primatene™ mist ) affect pulmonary function also restrict accordingly . Multiple Children One Family : It explain primary caregiver one child may participate study . If one child meet criteria interested , RA put name child interested hat randomly pull one name hat identify subject . INFORMED CONSENT : The goal enroll parent assume primary least equal responsibility day-to-day management child 's asthma . Written consent obtain RNA parent ( ) conduct parental interview , ( b ) abstract pre-identified data child 's medical record data , ( c ) obtain permission interview child child perform spirometry maneuver . Verbal assent child complete interview spirometry maneuver also obtain RNA . Subjects inform free withdraw study anytime , nonparticipation affect child 's healthcare , names appear study material . We use unique 4-digit number code data provide confidentiality . All consent assent material available English Spanish . Parents decide language prefer . STATISTICAL MODELS AND METHODS OF ANALYSIS : Eligible participant decline participate compare enrolled demographic characteristic check sample bias . Descriptive statistic use identify distribution data total instrument scale score study survey . Means standard deviation examine continuous variable proportion categorical variable . Linear regression ( SAS ) use examine Aim 1 study . A growth model time vary covariates ( use MPlus ) use examine Aim 2 study . Growth model allows examination individual time one outcome variable ( e.g. , IRs , treatment decision , asthma control ) . Random effect specify model capture individual difference development . MPlus uses multivariate approach maximum likelihood estimation type model . The time score slope growth factor fix 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 define linear growth model equidistant time point . The zero time score slope growth factor defines intercept growth factor , coefficient intercept growth factor fix one , residual variance outcomes estimate allow different across time , residual correlate . Illness representation , CAM , controller medication use time vary variable model . Data reduction : Psychometric analysis conduct AIRS© , C-ACT , P-CASCL/CASCL scale separately ethnic group determine factor structure ( construct validity ) , internal consistency ( reliability ) , external validity replicate original instrument across Latino subgroup . Internal consistency scale assess use Cronbach 's alpha . Factor analysis conduct specify varimax rotation minimum eigenvalue 1 . External validity AIRS© instrument assess test hypothesis original development work show score AIRS© instrument differ ethnicity , education , poverty differentiate child appropriate versus suboptimal medication regimen . Missing Data : We recognize drawback analyze case complete data . Our primary strategy minimize attrition great extent possible . Growth model allow miss data dependent variable use full maximum likelihood ( FIML ) method assume data miss random dependent variable score tend correlate previous measure earlier data collection point . When predictor variable miss , investigator use multiple imputation . For multiple imputation , investigator utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo method impute enough data monotone miss data pattern . Once investigator monotone miss data pattern , investigator employ imputation approach appropriate type data ( continuous , dichotomous , low frequency count data ) . We perform sensitivity analysis ensure result similar various assumption . Ultimately , investigator determine whether imputation valid sufficient add value data justify complexity involve reporting analysis . Non-normal Distributions : Full attention give distributional property variable regression diagnostics . We employ negative binomial error assumption make adjustment outlying data point . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Aim # 1 : Are difference illness representation Mexican Puerto Rican parent due social contextual factor ( i.e. , acculturation , education , parental age , poverty , child 's illness duration , household member asthma , parent-healthcare provider relationship ) ? Ethnicity ( 0=Mexican 1=Puerto Rican ) healthcare set ( 1=school-based 2=Breathmobile 3=hospital-based ) enter classification factor regression model covariates examine difference total AIRS© score well individual subscale score . The interaction acculturation ethnic group include assess potential mediation effect acculturation IR . Aim # 2 : Are disparities asthma control Mexican Puerto Rican child due difference parent ' treatment decision ( CAM controller medication use ) change illness representation one year period control effect acculturation , social contextual factor , environmental trigger , advice receive others ? There maximum 5 observation subject sample ( 5 time period ) . The primary interest regression asthma control time assessment . The model include regression parameter assume fix ; fix regression specify separately ethnic group . The test homogeneity regression primary research interest . Non-homogeneity regression would suggest ethnic group difference relationship time asthma control . Individual regression asthma control time subject also include model . These regression random associate level random factor ( subject ) . They regard deviation overall fixed regression . Henderson202 discuss method random regression assumption regard ; analysis mixed model ( fix random effect ) type , test homogeneity regression mixed model . Because investigator hypothesize level acculturation could potentially influence result , include covariate model . Following convention outline Kline , Byrne , Cudeck &amp; Browne , criterion assess adequacy fit : chi-square df ratio less 2 , comparative fit index ( CFI ) Tucker-Lewis Index ( TLI ) .90 , root mean square error approximation ( RMSEA ) .08 . Examination Mediation . We examine mediation model structural equation , test significance direct indirect effect equality . Testing delta method bootstrapping . While test involve indirect effect primary interest , investigator case carry priori test reflect Mackinnon 's recommendation . Mediation test first showing X ( e.g. , ethnic group ) associate M ( e.g. , illness representation ) Y ( e.g. , treatment decision ) . Second , path model estimate simultaneously regress ( ) Y M X , ( b ) M X . This repeat specify X=illness representation , M=treatment decision , Y=asthma control . The paths X M M Y must statistically significant criterion , addition significance indirect effect . If path X Y drop zero , full mediation suggest . Partial mediation suggest extent X still predict Y mediator ( ) simultaneously enter . These first-stage test also result model estimation use test indirect effect . In model estimation , investigator use full information method ( e.g. , FIML ) unless clear indication OLS adequate . Henderson Ceci describe delta-test method moderation mediation .</detailed_description>
