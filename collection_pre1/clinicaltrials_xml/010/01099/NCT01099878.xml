	<brief_title>Cycling Exercise With Functional Electrical Stimulation Improves Postural Control Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients stroke frequently result secondary complication neuromuscular system . For post-stroke patient , vary deficit sensation , muscle strength , muscle tone associate reaction paretic limb often affect activity daily live . Cycling exercise commonly suggest improve cardiovascular fitness functional mobility patient stroke . ( Janssen , 2008 ; Holt , 2001 ; Potempa 1995 ) Cycling exercise require less balance capacity exercise intensity control . The kinematic pattern cycle similar walk one important motor function recover stroke patient ( Ferrante , 2008 ) . Others study report repetitive passive movement spastic muscle increase range motion reduce stiffness hypertonic joint stroke patient ( Bressel , 2002 ; Yeh , 2007 ) . Above study ( Bressel , 2002 ; Yeh , 2007 ) suggest leg cyclic movement may possible therapeutic modality reduce hypertonia one factor disturb functional activity stroke patient . The application functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) usually use physical therapy assist paretic limb perform functional task ( 5-7 ) . The previous study report functional task hemiplegic hand improved electrical stimulation treatment ( Wu , 2006 ; Santos , 2006 ) . FES also use improve walk ability subject stroke ( Bogataj , 1989 ; Yan , 2005 ; Salm , 2006 ) . Clinical study central motor neuroplasticity also support role goal-oriented , repetitive , active movement therapy paretic limb enhance motor recovery relearn stroke patient . ( Ferrante , 2008 ) In first half 1980s , FES apply cycle exercise paretic leg people spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The beneficial effect cycle exercise via FES evidence increase muscle strength endurance , increase bone density , suppression spasticity , improvement cardiopulmonary function , many physiological psychological effect benefit SCI patient ( Donaldson et al. , 2000 ; Gfohler Lugner , 2000 ; Gfohler et al. , 2001 ) . Recently , similar FES assist cycling device also use stroke patient ( Janssen , 2008 ; Ferrante , 2008 ) . They report FES assist training provide increase aerobic capacity functional performance . However , one study ( Janssen , 2008 ) functional performance evaluate clinical scale reflect change affect limb influence training exercise . It worthwhile realize effect affect leg change postural control FES-cycling training . A new FES-cycling device ( Figure.1 ) , modify previous prototype ( Chen , 2004 ) , use study . This device combine FES cycling system equip ankle-foot orthoses . The FES stimulate quadriceps hamstring affected leg sweep past specific angle . The aim study determine whether short-term FES-cycling program stroke patient reduce muscle tone affect leg immediately influence postural control subject .</detailed_description>
