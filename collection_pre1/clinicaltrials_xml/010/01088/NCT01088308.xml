	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Differentiation Tachycardia Episodes Using Tissue Perfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct evaluate feasibility detect hemodynamic change induce supra-ventricular ventricular tachycardia ( SVT VT ) use tissue perfusion . Patients standard indication either electrophysiological study implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) implant include study . Tissue perfusion arterial blood pressure monitor record throughout electrophysiological procedure ICD implant testing . The study conduct two consecutive phase . After completion study phase I study phase II commence . Study phase I acute non-invasive study patient indication electrophysiological study , tissue perfusion measure non-invasively epi-cutaneous tissue perfusion sensor . Phase II acute invasive study patient indication implantation ICD , tissue perfusion sensor place surgically prepared device pocket muscular pectoralis muscular pectoralis major muscular pectoralis minor .</detailed_description>
