	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate inherit genetic factor play role development familial pulmonary fibrosis identify group gene predispose individual develop pulmonary fibrosis . Finding gene cause pulmonary fibrosis first step develop good method early diagnosis improve treatment pulmonary fibrosis . The overall hypothesis inherit genetic factor predispose individual develop pulmonary fibrosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Genetics Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis ( FPF ) sub-category idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IIPs ) . IIPs progressive lung condition , limited treatment option unknown etiology . Though IIPs associate genetic risk factor environmental exposure , molecular mechanism underlie disease progression remain poorly understood . This investigation seek identify group genetic locus play role development familial interstitial pneumonia ( FIP ) FPF , 2 case IIP see within family .</detailed_description>
