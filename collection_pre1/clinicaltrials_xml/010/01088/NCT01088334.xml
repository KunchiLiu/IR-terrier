	<brief_summary>Background Patients idiopathic venous thromboembolism ( IVTE ) appear risk approximately 10 % symptomatic malignancy within 3 year IVTE . It clear extensive screening malignant disease lead survival benefit patient IVTE . The SOMIT study learn feasible screen patient IVTE malignancy screen mean computer tomography ( CT ) chest abdomen plus mammography woman potential cost-effective . The SOMIT study could show survival benefit due design study . Primary objective : cancer related mortality Methods : The Trousseau study design multicenter , prospective concurrently control cohort study . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Proven first symptomatic deep venous thromboembolic event ; 2 . Without : know risk factor venous thromboembolism . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Proven deep venous thromboembolic event medical history , age 40 year ; 2 . Patients without sign malignancy routine investigation ( medical history , physical examination , laboratory investigation chest X-ray ) include . Depending standard care hospital interest , one group patient screen mean CT-chest abdomen plus mammography , group additional investigation . Follow-up aim 3 year group ( 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 36 month thromboembolic event ) . Data like mortality rate , morbidity due screening procedure , additional investigation , number cancer patient detect extensive screening , number cancer patient three year IVTE , number kind investigation perform information cancer treatment hospitalization collect . If information indicate survival benefit data enable u perform cost-effectiveness analysis . Endpoint : Mortality . Statistics : Based prevalence occult malignancy VTE patient , nature stage malignancy , expect mortality , anticipate detection cancer early treatment related decrease mortality need , order detect true difference size 80 percent power two-tailed certainty five percent , 750 patient group . Therefore , total 1500 patient require study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : Although randomize design ideal study prefer multicenter , prospective concurrently control cohort study design study . This base experience SOMIT study , two member executive committee ( MH Prins , JMMB Otten ) involve . The SOMIT study originally suppose conduct eight country . Medical ethical committee country however consider unethical conduct randomize study . Either fact study contain control arm , screen arm ( thus study ) consider unethical . Patients well physician find difficult let fate decide whether patient would screen cancer , even though clear screen life-saving . Moreover , SOMIT study , physician notice patient IVTE cancer detect early screening group . This make even difficult withhold additional screening procedure patient routine group . Many physician show strong preference one arm study . Therefore include many patient could . With prospective cohort design expect avoid problem . Per hospital participates Trousseau study physician hospital treat patient accord local preference screen screen . All hospital match regard population much possible . Statistics : The prevalence occult cancer time thrombotic episode patient IVTE estimate 10 % . Based nature stage malignancy , expect half patient occult malignant disease die 3 year follow-up , result cancer-related mortality 5 % . In addition , approximately half patient malignant disease survive 3 year , residual recurrent cancer present . Therefore , cancer-related mortality residual recurrent cancer present 75 % patient occult malignant disease presentation , i.e. , 7-8 % patient study cohort . We anticipate approximately 80 % occult malignancy detect extensive screen early treatment result 50 % 75 % reduction 3-year incidence cancer-related mortality residual recurrent malignancy .</detailed_description>
