	<brief_title>Study IMC-11F8 Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , open-label , single-arm , Phase 1 study enroll 18 participant maximum . The actual size vary depend dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) observe resultant size cohort . Participants receive IMC-11F8 administer intravenously , every 2 week Days 1 8 every 3 week 6 week ( 1 cycle ) . All infusion administer within ± 1 day schedule administration date . After 1 cycle treatment , participant objective response stable disease may continue receive IMC-11F8 dose schedule disease progression withdrawal criterion meet . A minimum 3 participant enrol cohort . Dose escalation successive cohort occur participant complete 1 cycle therapy . Participants enrol sequentially cohort . A complete participant either participant completes initial 6-week treatment period ( Cycle 1 ) participant discontinues therapy IMC-11F8-related toxicity Cycle 1 . Participants complete first 6 week treatment reason IMC-11F8-related toxicity replace . Toxicity data cohort review prior dose escalation . Upon completion require safety evaluation initial 6 week , next cohort new participant treat next high dose level use dose escalation scheme .</detailed_description>
