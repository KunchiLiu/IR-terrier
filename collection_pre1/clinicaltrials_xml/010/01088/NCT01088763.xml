	<brief_title>Gamma-Secretase Inhibitor RO4929097 Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors , CNS Tumors , Lymphoma , T-Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 administer orally child relapse refractory solid tumor lymphoma two schedule : daily orally 3-day on/4-day weekly schedule ( schedule A ) daily 5 consecutive day weekly schedule ( schedule B ) . II . To define describe toxicity drug administer schedule child relapse refractory solid tumor , lymphoma , T-cell leukemia . III . To estimate MTD recommend phase II dose gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 administer dexamethasone . IV . To define describe toxicity gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 administer dexamethasone . V. To characterize pharmacokinetics gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 child refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 child solid CNS tumor lymphoma within confines phase I study . II . To obtain initial efficacy data antitumor activity gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 combine dexamethasone child relapsed-refractory T-cell leukemia ( T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ ALL ] ) . III . To study effect gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 Hes1 ( hairy/enhancer split ) component Notch signal pathway peripheral blood mononuclear cell and/or T-ALL blast . ( exploratory ) IV . To examine archival tumor sample expression JAGGED1 , JAGGED2 , cleave NOTCH1 , HES1 , HES5 IHC amplification NOTCH1 NOTCH2 use FISH analysis . ( exploratory ) V. To preliminarily assess change follow treatment gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 use FDG PET image . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 follow phase II study . Patients enrol sequentially group A B . GROUP A : Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 , 22-24 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP B : Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may also receive concurrent oral dexamethasone twice daily day gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 administration . Once MTD recommend phase II dose RO4929097 plus dexamethasone child solid tumor , include CNS tumor , lymphoma identify , dose use patient relapsed-refractory T-ALL ( phase 2 portion study ) evaluate RO4929097 combination dexamethasone use one studied schedule . Blood , plasma , bone marrow , tumor tissue sample may collect baseline periodically first course correlative lab tumor study , include pharmacokinetics . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . *NOTE : This trial intend Phase I/II , trial never continue Phase II portion .</detailed_description>
