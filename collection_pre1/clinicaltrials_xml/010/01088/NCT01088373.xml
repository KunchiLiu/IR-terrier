	<brief_summary>Higher risk MDS del ( 5q ) carry poor prognosis , show response azacitidine Lenalidomide single agent . The combination Lenalidomide Azacytidine currently test non del 5q MDS patient . Preliminary result recently present ASH meeting ( Sekeres et al , 2007 ) . Overall , combination Lenalidomide Azacitidine well-tolerated early result suggest efficacy advanced MDS without del 5q . In trial , combine Lenalidomide Azacytidine high risk MDS del ( 5q ) . Patients receive azacitidine ( 75mg/m2/day 5 day every 28 day ) combine escalate dos lenalidomide ( start relatively low dose ) . For patient hematological CR , PR , HI marrow CR cycle 2 4 , mandatory continue Azacitidine + Lenalidomide long unacceptable toxicity overt progression , schedule yield response . In patient still respond 52 week , drug continue supply , follow death continue patient .</brief_summary>
