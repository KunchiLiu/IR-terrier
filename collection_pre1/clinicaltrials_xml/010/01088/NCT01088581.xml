	<brief_summary>Several adjuvant therapy attempt reduce uni-centric , intra- extrahepatic recurrence curative surgical resection hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . However , efficacy adjuvant therapy remain unclear , standard postoperative therapy . The investigator investigate whether adjuvant hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) cisplatin reduces recurrence HCC curative resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Hepatic Arterial Infusional Chemotherapy After Curative Resection Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common malignancy world . In particular , global occurrence rate HCC rank first male fourth female . Despite advance diagnosis medical , surgical management , HCC still consider difficult disease cure high recurrence rate , even surgical resection . The cumulative 3-year recurrence rate resection curative aim approximately 80 % .1 Portal vein invasion satellite nodule important factor predispose patient recurrence resection.2 More importantly , recurrence resection usually result high rate mortality.3 Uni-centric intrahepatic metastatic recurrence usually indicate metastatic spread primary tumor generally distinguish multi-centric recurrence short interval resection recurrence ( 12 month primary tumor spread vs. 3 year multi-centric recurrence ) .4,5 In regard , several adjuvant therapy use attempt primarily reduce uni-centric , intra- extrahepatic recurrence curative surgical resection HCC . However , efficacy adjuvant therapy curative resection still clear , recommendation postoperative therapy exist . Several chemotherapeutic agent , include doxorubicin , epirubicin , mitomycin C , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , cisplatin deliver hepatic artery via implant port system first-line regimen adjuvant therapy curative resection HCC.6-8 A recent study report repetitive short-course hepatic arterial infusion 5-FU cisplatin show significant anti-tumor effect advance HCC.9 With hypothesis post-operative chemotherapeutic agent deliver via hepatic artery may eliminate residual cancer cell liver , design prospective study determine whether adjuvant hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy ( HAIC ) 5-FU cisplatin reduce incidence recurrence HCC improve overall patient survival curative resection .</detailed_description>
