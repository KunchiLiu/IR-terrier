	<brief_summary>The TReatment ADP receptor iNhibitorS : Longitudinal Assessment Treatment Patterns Events Acute Coronary Syndrome ( TRANSLATE-ACS ) study prospective , observational longitudinal study evaluate real world effectiveness use prasugrel ADP receptor inhibitor therapy among myocardial infarction ( MI ) participant treat percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) index hospitalization . Participant management treatment decision discretion care team per routine clinical practice . Approximately 17,000 participant enrol approximately 350 site United States . Follow-up conduct 15 month approximately 15,650 participant . TRANSLATE-ACS complement result randomize controlled clinical trial current registry address real world treatment pattern clinical outcome MI participant manage PCI initiate ADP receptor inhibitor therapy . In addition determine effectiveness prasugrel comparison ADP receptor inhibitor , study also determine factor associate initial ADP receptor inhibitor selection longitudinal pattern use , evaluate safety , describe compare resource use medical cost associate ADP receptor inhibitor . Additionally , study generate continuum information inpatient outpatient setting provide comprehensive picture participant treatment outcomes currently available novel ADP receptor inhibitor .</brief_summary>
