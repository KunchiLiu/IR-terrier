	<brief_title>Hedgehog Inhibitors Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence new small molecule capacity block Hedgehog signal pathway provide novel therapeutic approach pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat primary tumor , stroma , systemic metastasis pancreatic cancer stem cell hedgehog pathway inhibition . This phase 2 clinical trial evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) patient previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . We hypothesize combination cytotoxic agent ( gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel ) Hedgehog inhibitor GDC-0449 may increase PFS . This study include correlative study attempt understand stem cell biology mechanism observe clinical benefit use Hedgehog inhibitor GDC-0449 . These include change hedgehog pathway change pancreatic cancer stem cell marker pre post treatment biopsy . The safety GDC-0449 combine chemotherapy gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel also assess evaluate adverse event rate . Following determination eligibility patient receive follow treatment : 1 . One cycle Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 nab-Paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 day 1 , 8 , 15 ( 28 day cycle ) 2 . Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 nab-Paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day cycle combination oral GDC-0449 150 mg daily Patients may continue treatment regimen experience progressive disease unacceptable toxicity , require palliative radiotherapy , withdraw consent physician feel longer best interest continue treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient histologically cytologically confirm metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . Patients islet cell tumor exclude . Biopsy within 14 day start treatment . 2 . Patient measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . 3 . Patient NOT receive previous radiotherapy , surgery chemotherapy investigational drug therapy treatment metastatic disease . If patient receive radiotherapy , chemotherapy investigational therapy adjuvant set complete 3 week prior enrollment . If patient receive gemcitabine adjuvant setting , tumor recurrence must occur least six month complete last dose gemcitabine 4 . Age &gt; 18 year . 5 . Life expectancy great 1 month . 6 . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % ) . 7 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function 1 . Patient receive chemotherapy radiotherapy metastatic disease 2 . Patient receive investigational agent . 3 . Patient known brain metastasis , unless previously treat well control least three month ( define clinically stable , edema , steroid stable 2 scan least 4 week apart ) 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition GDC0449 agent use study . 5 . Patients take medication narrow therapeutic index metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) , include warfarin sodium ( CoumadinÂ® ) ineligible . 6 . Uncontrolled illness include , limited , ongoing active infection require IV antibiotic , symptomatic congestive heart failure control medication , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Pregnant woman exclude 8 . Patient undergone major surgery , diagnostic surgery ( i.e . surgery do obtain biopsy diagnosis without removal organ ) within four week prior Day 1 treatment study . 9 . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render patient high risk treatment complication</criteria>
