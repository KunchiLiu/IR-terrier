	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety feasibility long term boost vaccination lethally irradiate , allogenic pancreatic tumor cell vaccine transfected granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene alone give combination either single intravenous dose daily metronomic oral dos cyclophosphamide treatment patient surgically resect adenocarcinoma head , neck , tail uncinate process pancreas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Boost Vaccinations Pancreatic Tumor Cell Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : 1 . To evaluate safety feasibility long term boost vaccination lethally irradiate , allogeneic pancreatic tumor cell vaccine transfected GM-CSF gene give alone combination either single intravenous dose daily metronomic oral dos cyclophosphamide treatment patient surgically resect adenocarcinoma head , neck , uncinate process pancreas . Secondary Objective : 1 . To assess effect boost vaccination long-term treatment immune modulate dos cyclophosphamide number , repertoire avidity peripheral mesothelin-specific CD8+ T cell . 2 . To estimate disease-free overall survival surgically resect pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient treat vaccine boost without low dose cyclophosphamide . Eligible subject receive intradermal administration pancreatic tumor vaccine consist two irradiated , allogeneic pancreatic tumor cell line transfected granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene without low dose cyclophosphamide . Study participant recruit prior three arm neoadjuvant vaccination without low dose cyclophosphamide trial vaccine naive patient . The vaccination boost offer continuation care . Patients J0810 study remain arm J0810 study receive parental vaccine . The first vaccine boost give sooner six month ( +/- 1 month ) last prime vaccination . The vaccine administer arm every six month ( +/- 1 month ) previous vaccine ten year pass , subject long meet eligibility criterion , long wish participate study , vaccine supply exhaust . Arm A participant receive pancreatic cancer vaccine alone . Arm B participant vaccinate receive single low-dose cyclophosphamide ( 200 mg/m2 ) intravenously one day prior vaccination . Participants Arm C receive cyclophosphamide 50 mg day start 28 day prior day 1 vaccination till 28 day post vaccination . Vaccine naive patient first receive three prime vaccine one month apart combination single low-dose cyclophosphamide ( 200 mg/m2 ) intravenously one day prior vaccination . Then receive boost vaccine participant Arm B J0810 study .</detailed_description>
