	<brief_summary>Chemoradiotherapy become standard care woman locally advanced cervical cancer . The available data support 30 50 % reduction risk death cervical cancer woman locally advanced disease undergo radiotherapy ( RT ) concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy compare RT alone . Despite fact currently best treatment locally advanced cervical cancer , 5-year overall survival still 52 % . The fully human , agonist monoclonal antibody mapatumumab bind Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Receptor 1 ( TRAIL-R1 , DR4 ) induce cytotoxicity multiple tumor cell line vitro vivo . In multiple phase I phase II study , mapatumumab appear safe single agent combination chemotherapy , include cisplatin . In cervical cancer cell line , mapatumumab induce apoptosis 51 % cell . Mapatumumab combination irradiation increase apoptosis 83 % . In phase 1b/2 study , investigator evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy mapatumumab combination cisplatin radiotherapy patient locally advanced cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
