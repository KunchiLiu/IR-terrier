	<detailed_description>Clinical decision make require two distinct skill : ability classify patient ' condition diagnostic management category permit application `` best evidence '' guideline , ability individualize - precisely - contextualize care patient whose circumstance need require variation standard approach care . Most assessment medical education place heavy emphasis biomedical decision-making little emphasis incorporate contextual factor may essential plan patient ' care . The goal project demonstrate provide validity evidence innovative standardize patient ( SP ) method assess medical student clinical year ability detect respond individual contextual factor patient encounter overcomes aforementioned challenge .
