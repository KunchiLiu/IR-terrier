	<brief_summary>This research do try reduce radiation side effect happen standard radiation method . Generally surgery , radiation therapy , sometimes chemotherapy standard treatment people squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx . The study look give slightly small dose radiation ( de-intensification ) see regularly expect late toxicity ( two year receive treatment ) reduce . This study also try see small dose radiation equally effective treating cancer see improve quality life . Along radiation treatment plan participant study surgery tumor receive chemotherapy ( cisplatin carboplatin ) . The possible surgery chemotherapy participant 's doctor . Study participant test Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) . This tissue test require study . Some study suggest HPV-related cancer biologically clinically different compare non-HPV-related cancer . Some study find patient HPV-related oropharynx cancer well response treatment . This test help researcher learn HPV-related cancer .</brief_summary>
