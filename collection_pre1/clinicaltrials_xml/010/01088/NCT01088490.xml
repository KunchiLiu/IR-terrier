	<detailed_description>Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , good know poisonous gas , lately emerge third gaseous transmitter mammal , next nitric oxide ( NO ) carbon monoxide ( CO ) . H2S present human tissue concentration 50 μM . Most synthesized brain , cardiovascular system , kidneys liver . In human tissue H2S synthesize L-cysteine two enzymes cystathionine-γ-lyase cystathionine-β-synthase . H2S work stimulate ATP sensitive potassium channel involve regulation vascular tone , myocardial contractility , insulin secretion neurotransmission . In numerous animal model , H2S deficiency show arterial pulmonary arterial hypertension , Alzheimer 's disease liver cirrhosis . Increased production higher serum concentration show inflammatory disease , septic shock stroke . Most study far conducted animal already show therapeutic potential . In available literature study human focus H2S concentration critically ill prognostic value . Hypothesis We test hypothesis high serum H2S concentration admission ICU link high mortality patient shock reason . Serum H2S concentration related treatment support vaso-active drug ( noradrenalin , epinephrine ) . Material method In study include adult patient admit medical ICU due shock reason . Shock define systemic arterial pressure lower 90mmHg drop systemic arterial pressure least 40mmHg 15minutes elevation serum lactate value . Patients include basis clinical appearance shock - hypotension need vasopressor , brady- tachycardia , sign peripheral hypo perfusion , oliguria change mental status . Exclusion criterion : patient young 18years patient shock From blood sample draw admission ICU measure H2S concentration . H2S concentration measure spectrophotometrically5 first describe 19496 refined 19657 . Spectrophotometrical determination H2S concentration tissue plasma previously use many researchers.3,8-11 Blood sample centrifuge quickly collection obtain plasma . 200 μL plasma mixed pre-prepared solution 100 μL 10 % ( wt/vol ) trichloroacetic acid 60 μL 1 % ( wt/vol ) zinc acetate , trap dissolve H2S . The mixture freeze 20 C analysis . After sufficient number sample obtain , measure H2S concentration series . 40µL 20 µM N , N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate 7,2 M HCl 40µL 30 µM FeCl3 v 1,2 M HCl add unfrozen sample . After 10-20 min incubation room temperature final mixture centrifuge 9000 rpm 5 minute remove precipitate . After centrifugation absorption 670 nm measure spectrophotometer . All analysis do duplicate . Calibration curve absorbance versus sulfide concentration obtain know concentration Na2S ( 0,699 µM - 69,93 µM ) concentration H2S plasma calculate . Impact plasma H2S concentration admission ICU ICU mortality observe trough nonparametric statistical analysis . Expectations We hypothesize high serum H2S concentration admission ICU patient shock cause indicator severity shock cardiovascular deterioration , related treatment support vaso-active drug ( noradrenalin , epinephrine ) . Thus high serum H2S concentration expect well prognostic factor ICU mortality patient shock currently establish lactic acid .</detailed_description>
