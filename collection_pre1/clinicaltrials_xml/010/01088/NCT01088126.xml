	<brief_summary>The end point catheter ablation complex fractionate atrial electrograms ( CFAE ) establish yet . Furthermore , incomplete CFAE ablation may potential develop atrial tachyarrhythmias ( AT ) . The investigator hypothesize linear ablation extend cluster CFAE would better strategy focal ablation individual CFAE site .</brief_summary>
