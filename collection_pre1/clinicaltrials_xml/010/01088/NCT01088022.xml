	<brief_title>Aprepitant Prevention Acute Delayed Nausea Vomiting Patients Receiving High-emetogenic Dose Cyclophosphamide Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Harvesting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background rationale Increasing demand apheresis service make efficient harvest peripheral blood stem cell ( PBCS ) essential . To reduce hospital stay autologous peripheral blood stem cell collection recently start out-patient regimen highly emetogenic , intermediate dos cyclophosphamide ( 3 g/m2 ) 1 . Despite prophylaxis 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 ( 5-HT3 ) receptor antagonists dexamethasone , chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( CINV ) remain major problem . Aprepitant ( EMEND ) first commercially available drug new class agent , substance P/neurokinin NK-1 receptor antagonist . Oral aprepitant , combination 5-hydroxytriptamine-3 ( 5-HT3 ) serotonin receptor antagonist dexamethasone , recommend highly emetogenic chemotherapy 2-5 . Since aprepitant moderately inhibit CYP3A4 , concomitant administration aprepitant cyclophosphamide might decrease cyclophosphamide clearance , consequently , reduce exposure active metabolite 6 , thus impair efficacy autologous stem cell mobilization . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study design demonstrate , without impact upon toxicity stem cell harvesting , aprepitant-palonosetron-dexamethasone regimen well palonosetron-dexamethasone therapy prevention CINV 2,7 . 2.1 Objectives 2.1 Primary objective The objective single centre , randomize , double blind , placebo control phase III trial confirm extend preliminary data efficacy safety combine aprepitant , palonosetron dexamethasone prevent CINV high emetic therapy cyclophosphamide 3 g/m2 compare palonosetron dexamethasone regimen . 2.2 Secondary objective Peripheral blood stem cell harvest . 3 . Eligibility 3.1 Inclusion Criteria - Male female patient ≥ 18 year age - Patient able understand study procedure agree participate study give write informed consent . - Patient schedule receive highly emetogenic cyclophosphamide IV chemotherapy ( 3 g/m2 ) autologous PBSC harvest - Patient Karnofsky score ≥60 - Normal laboratory value - Normal ECG - HBV- , HCV- HIV-negative - Negative urine pregnancy test woman childbearing age 3.2 Exclusion criterion - Serious accompany disorder impair organ function ( particular impair leave ventricular function severe cardiac arrhythmia ) - Platelets &lt; 100 000/mm3 , leukocytes &lt; 2 500/mm3 - Known hypersensitivity medication use - Known HIV-positivity - Active hepatitis infection - Pregnancy lactation period - Not application inclusion criterion 4 . Trial design Eligible patient randomize receive oral dos Aprepitant ( 125 mg day 1 , 80 mg day 2 3 ) , dexamethasone ( 8 mg day 1 3 ) single intravenous dose palonosetron ( 0.25 mg day 1 ) versus placebo plus dexamethasone ( 8 mg day 1 3 ) single intravenous dose palonosetron ( 0.25 mg day 1 ) . The study conduct accordance ethical principle Helsinki Declaration , GCP applicable regulatory requirement ( ) . 5 . Therapeutic regimen Regimen Study medication First day Second day Third day Dose Dose Dose Aprepitant Aprepitant 125-mg capsule 80-mg capsule 80-mg capsule Palonosetron 0.25 mg i.v . Dexamethasone 8 mg i.v . 8 mg os 8 mg o Control Aprepitant 125-mg placebo capsule 80-mg placebo capsule 80-mg placebo capsule Palonosetron 0.25 mg i.v . Dexamethasone 8 mg i.v . 8 mg os 8 mg os 6 . Assessments tool 6.1 Efficacy Efficacy data obtain use patient 's daily diary ( day 1 5 ) reporting episode retch vomiting , severity nausea ( use categorical scale none , mild , moderate severe ) , overall quality life . The FLIE8 questionnaire complete day 1 ( start chemotherapy ) 6 ( chemotherapy ) . 6.2 Safety data Safety parameter : medical history , physical examination weight , vital sign , laboratory test ( hematology , chemistry , urine analysis urine pregnancy test woman childbearing age ) . All side effect attribute combination therapy record use patient 's daily diary . 7 . Criteria evaluation - Complete response ( CR ) : emetic episode rescue medication first 120 hour post-chemotherapy - Complete control ( CC ) : emetic episode , use rescue medication mild nausea 8 . Statistical consideration 8.1 Sample size Sample size define assume cumulative incidence rate primary endpoint 68 % treatment group 41 % control group ( see reference 2 7 ) . With balanced allocation two group , consider two sided test α=0.05 ß=0.20 total 110 patient need . As withdrawal drop-outs expect total 120 patient enrol . 8.2 Statistical analysis plan Intention treat approach use efficacy analysis . The primary endpoint analyse binomial logistic model . The dependent variable vomit yes/no first 120 hour chemotherapy . Anti-emetic treatment , gender age enter explicative variable . Dichotomous secondary endpoint also analyse binomial logistic model . Multinomial logistic model analyze severity nausea , stratify 4 class . Generalized Linear Models investigate quantitative variable number retch vomit episode peripheral blood stem cell harvest . In test , p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . No interim analysis plan . 8.3 Endpoints Primary endpoint : complete response ( CR ) rate define number patient emetic episode rescue medication first 120 hour post-chemotherapy . Secondary endpoint : - CR rate acute ( 0-24 h ) delay ( 24-120 h ) phase ; - complete control rate ( CC ) define emetic episode , use rescue medication mild nausea ; - number emetic episode ; - severity nausea ; - impact CINV daily life measure Functional Living Index-Emesis ( FLIE ) ( total score &gt; 108 = impact ) ; - peripheral blood stem cell harvest ; - tolerability ( adverse event , drug-related adverse event , serious adverse event ; discontinuation treatment due adverse event ) . Adverse event classify use NCI Common Toxicity Criteria . 9 . Adverse event ( Definitions ) AE : An Adverse Event define untoward medical occurrence patient clinical trial subject medicinal product administer necessarily causal relationship treatment . An adverse event therefore unfavorable unintended sign ( rash enlarge liver ) , symptom ( nausea chest pain ) , abnormal laboratory finding ( include blood test , x-rays scan ) disease temporarily associate use protocol treatment , whether consider related investigational medicinal product . AR : An Adverse reaction investigational medicinal product untoward unintended response investigational medicinal product dose . All adverse event wich either reporting investigator sponsor judge reasonable causal relationship medicinal product qualify adverse reaction . The expression reasonable causal relationship mean convey general evidence argument suggest causal relationship . UAR : An Unexpected Adverse Reaction adverse reaction , nature , severity consistent applicable product information ( e.g . investigator 's brochure unapproved investigational product summary product characteristic ( SmPC ) authorise product ) . When outcome adverse reaction consistent applicable product information adverse reaction consider unexpected . Severity : The term `` severe '' often use describe intensity ( severity ) specific event . This `` serious , '' base patient/event outcome action criterion . SAE : A Serious Adverse Event define undesirable experience occur patient , whether consider related protocol treatment . SAR : A Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) consider related protocol treatment define Serious Adverse Reaction An Adverse Event Adverse Reaction consider serious : - result death , - life-threatening ( i.e . event subject risk death time event ; refer event hypothetically might cause death severe ) - require hospitalisation prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalisation , - result persistent significant disability incapacity , - result congenital anomaly birth defect . - result major medical condition ( i.e . important adverse reaction immediately life threaten result death hospitalization may jeopardize patient may require intervention prevent one outcomes list ) . SUSAR : Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions . 10 . Informed consent All patient inform - aim study - possible adverse event - procedure possible hazard patient expose - mechanism treatment allocation - strict confidentiality patient data - medical record possibly review trial purpose authorize individual treat physician . The template patient 's informed consent statement give appendix protocol . The informed consent document submit Ethics Committees approval . The competent Ethics Committee institution must approve informed consent document center join study . It emphasize patient information sheet participation voluntary patient free refuse participation protocol whenever he/she want . This impact patient 's subsequent care . Documented informed consent must obtain patient include study register and/or randomize . The write informed consent form must sign personally dated patient patient 's legally acceptable representative .</detailed_description>
