	<detailed_description>Primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) , devastate insidiously progressive cholestatic liver disease , result advance inflammation , fibrosis obliteration intra- extrahepatic bile duct , lead cirrhosis end-stage liver disease . PSC uncommon disorder ( prevalence US 8-14/100,000 even low prevalence child ) . Although prognosis child may somewhat better , approximately one third pediatric patient require transplantation adulthood . Other transplantation , date therapy conclusively proven improve long-term outcome . Ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) improve biochemical marker liver disease , although high dos clearly improve long-term outcome adult . Furthermore , recent large adult trial high-dose UDCA therapy suggest high incidence serious adverse event poor outcome UDCA treatment , lead many center discontinue UDCA therapy adult patient . Childhood PSC different adult disease include strong association autoimmune marker histologic feature trend high transaminase diagnosis . Furthermore , response intermediate-dose UDCA therapy , strike prompt improvement biochemistry compare adult . In light prompt normalization liver enzymes fact UDCA well tolerate child , pediatric hepatologists reluctant generalize adult UDCA study result child stop UDCA therapy . This present significant dilemma : Should UDCA therapy stop pediatric PSC patient avoid possible adverse influence long-term prognosis risk lose possible beneficial effect disease progression child ? Additional factor child PSC/autoimmune hepatitis ( AIH ) overlap long-term adverse effect corticosteroid azathioprine use . If UDCA therapy effective monotherapy , complication may avoid . Therefore , propose preliminary UDCA withdrawal reinstitution trial pediatric PSC patient collect data support design large , longer-term randomize , placebo-controlled trial UDCA therapy childhood PSC . This pilot study , utilize infrastructure participate center STOPSC ( Studies Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ) consortium , test follow hypothesis : 1 ) UDCA therapy yield rapid biochemical response child PSC , thus withdrawal would lead increased biochemical evidence disease . 2 ) UDCA therapy suppress liver biliary inflammation child PSC , thus withdrawal therapy would result burst inflammatory activity increase serum cytokine biomarkers , 3 ) Biochemical control childhood PSC histologic feature AIH dependent upon treatment immunosuppression addition UDCA , therefore childhood PSC without histologic feature AIH worsen significantly UDCA withdrawal compare PSC histological feature AIH .</detailed_description>
