	<brief_summary>Obesity increase problem worldwide . Over 20 % people western society obese ( BMI &gt; 30kg/m2 ) 1-2 % morbidly obese ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) . According recent study 6.6 % Finns severely obese ( BMI &gt; 35kg/m2 ) 2.0 % morbidly obese ( BMI &gt; 40kg/m2 ) . Because conventional treatment often fail induce sustain weight loss obesity surgery increase rapidly many country . Currently , &gt; 300000 procedure perform US year . Thus many European country , include Finland , need obesity surgery rapidly increase . The important risk factor also obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) obesity , thus effective treatment obesity first-line treatment OSA . However , Reliable information prevalence OSA morbidly obese patient still lack . The current knowledge base small study , demonstrate prevalence OSA may higher believe , even 70-80 % morbidly obese patient . There definite need large , well-designed , prospective clinical study evaluate effect weight reduction OSA co-morbidities related obesity .

	<brief_title>A Study Surgical Weight Loss Treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance become public health concern modern society , affect million people . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) one common sleep disturbance . Obstructive sleep apnea affect mostly middle-aged work force , cause negative impact public health since increase mortality morbidity . In Finland , approximately 150,000 OSA patient , 15,000 patient severe , 50,000 moderate 85,000 mild form disease . The number patient assume strongly underestimate estimate one five adult least mild OSA . OSA tightly link metabolic abnormality contribute increase morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease . In addition , accident daytime sleepiness deteriorate person 's quality life work capacity . The important risk factor OSA obesity , thus effective treatment obesity first-line treatment OSA . In recent study observe lifestyle intervention early weight reduction curative treatment mild OSA . However , regardless promise result weight reduction treatment OSA still underestimate . Particularly alarm explode prevalence morbid obesity , estimation predict group patient increase rapidly . Unfortunately , conventional lifestyle weight reduction intervention proven ineffective long-term follow-up patient . In contrast , permanent weight reduction achieve bariatric surgery find favourable effect diabetes , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , also OSA . The treatment OSA demand patient physician . There simple treatment modality . Thus , exist definite need improve exist treatment modality search new one . The golden standard treat patient OSA nasal continuous airway pressure ( CPAP ) . It find effective , somewhat poor adherence ( 40-50 % ) treatment certainly major limitation . Moreover , little evidence possible beneficial metabolic effect CPAP . Considering rapid increase obesity unsatisfactory adherence CPAP treatment , bariatric surgery offer interest viable option alongside conventional treatment modality OSA . Reliable information prevalence OSA morbidly obese patient still lack . The current knowledge base small study , demonstrate prevalence OSA could higher believe , even 70-80 % morbidly obese patient . There definite need large , well-designed , prospective clinical study effect weight reduction OSA co-morbidities related obesity . Ever increase research data show strong link obesity OSA OSA major risk factor development cardiovascular disease provoke concept improve well clinical guideline diagnostics treatment risk group , obese patient .</detailed_description>
