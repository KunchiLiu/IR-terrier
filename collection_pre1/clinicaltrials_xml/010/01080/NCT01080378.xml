	<detailed_description>There exponential rise prevalence type 2 diabetes obesity Singapore coincident rapid nutritional socioeconomic transition . Differing birth weight , even normal range , predispose individual risk type 2 diabetes obesity . We aim examine causal pathway , developmental contribution effect weight loss intervention differential evaluate hypothesis genomic , birth weight , developmental , lifestyle environmental factor contribute variation phenotype observe adult obesity metabolic syndrome . Although many large study examine effect birth weight expression obesity metabolic syndrome phenotype , study usually lack in-depth physiological epigenetic/genomic study due large sample size . We therefore aim explore detailed aspect physiological epigenetic/genomic profile small statistically power sample , focus evaluate body composition , nutritional metabolic phenotype relationship epigenetic/genetic marker developmental history . In addition , examine effect weight loss intervention parameter . This assist weigh importance developmental genetic pathway contribute individual risk response efficacy intervention .</detailed_description>
