	<detailed_description>Assessment leave ventricular function essential determinant overall hemodynamics heart function therefore central interest intra-operative transesophageal echocardiography . Currently , frequently use method quantification leave ventricular function fractional shortening ( FS ) fractional area change ( FAC ) . These parameter assess transgastric mid papillary short axis view ( TG SAX ) quantify leave ventricular systolic function . Limitations method experience investigator - experienced investigator reliable reproducible data , load dependency method geometrical assumption one-dimensional measurement assessment three-dimensional contracting leave ventricle . Therefore , LV-function either over- underestimated influence segmental wall motion abnormality miss . Radial strain allow reliable reproducible evaluation leave ventricular function also allow assessment myocardial deformation representative segment wall left ventricle . Myocardial strain describe relative deformation myocardial fiber , normalize original length : L1-L0/L0 ( % ) . Strain positive ( radial thickening ) L1 &gt; L0 negative ( longitudinal shorten circumferential thinning ) L1 &lt; L0 . Radial strain sensitive change contractility le influenced loading condition occur frequently anaesthesia wide spectrum non-cardiac surgery result blood loss loss hemodynamic autoregulation due anesthetic drug . Therefore want ass leave ventricular function radial strain , fractional shortening ( FS ) fractional area change ( FAC ) non-cardiac patient non-cardiac operation . The aim study show radial strain reliable FS FAC leave ventricular function assessment robust change preload afterload condition . Study hypothesis The aim study compare fractional shortening ( FS ) fractional area change ( FAC ) radial strain TG mid SAX use TEE anaesthetized patient undergo non-cardiac surgery . Furthermore want investigate influence change load condition parameter anaesthetize non-cardiac patient undergo non-cardiac surgery . Therefore patient examine zero position , trendelenburg- anti-trendelenburg-position . Hypothesis : - Radial strain correlate FAC FS assessment leave ventricular function patient undergo non-cardiac surgery . FAC primary interest several advantage : easy calculate , itÂ´s consider surrogate ejection fraction , several study show excellent measure leave ventricular function even patient heterogeneity regional function . - The parameter radial strain , fractional shorten fractional area change correlate change load condition ( zero-position , trendelenburg- anti-trendelenburg-maneuver ) . Study design : prospective cohort study Inclusion criterion - Planned non-cardiac surgery minimum duration 60 minute , intubation indicate - Age 18 year - Signed informed consent Exclusion criterion - No patient 's consent - Subjects able understand study procedures - Contraindications transesophageal echocardiography ( oesophageal- , gastric disorder , hematologic disorder increase bleed incidence , ENT-surgery , surgery oesophagus stomach ) - Medical history kind heart disease , dyspnea angina pectoris - Hypertension ( medically treat ) - Diabetes - Atrial fibrillation Study protocol One day prior surgery patient screen invited participate study principle investigator . If consent principle investigator physical examination take medical history . On day surgery patient receive premedication usual . Arriving operate room patient monitor ECG , pulse oximetry blood pressure ( either invasive insertion arterial catheter , indicate , non-invasive blood pressure ) . A peripheral venous line need induction anaesthesia . Induction maintenance anaesthesia perform use standard protocol . After induction anaesthesia insertion need catheter ( central venous catheter , bladder catheter , arterial catheter , eventually pulmonary artery catheter ) transoesophageal probe , cover special condom , insert . The examination do principle investigator ( Dr. Ulrike Weber ) supervision expierenced investigator . Intraoperative TEE-Examinations ( T1 , T2 , T3 ) At T1 , T2 , T3 TEE-study examination perform zero position , Trendelenburg position , anti-Trendelenburg position . Positioning follow random order accord blind randomization list . Trendelenburg-position shall define study 10cm head-down horizontal position , anti-trendelenburg position 10cm head-up ( horizontal position ) . After position examination start 3 min delay reach steady-state loading condition . T1 - induction anesthesia After insertion probe transesophageal echo examination ( TEE ) perform - include complete routine clinical examination ( T1 ) : T2 - Intraoperative TEE , 3min position Positioning ( zero position , Trendelenburg , anti-trendelenburg ) perform accord randomization . 3min positioning , stable hemodynamics , recording HR , blood pressure , FS , FAC , Radial strain T3 - Intraoperative TEE , 3min position Positioning ( zero position , Trendelenburg , anti-trendelenburg ) perform accord randomization . 3min positioning , stable hemodynamics , recording HR , blood pressure , FS , FAC , Radial strain The following measurement take study ( 3 time sinus rhythm ) : - FS transgastric short axis mid papillary view - FAC transgastric short axis mid papillary view - Radial strain transgastric short axis mid papillary view Recordings 2D-mode image TG SAX shall take triplicate 3 heart cycle per store clip . The image store digitally EchoPAC-raw data format . Analysis data perform offline dedicate work station ( EchoPAC , GE Vingmed , Horten , Norway ) . Three different investigator analyse data two time two different time point . Expected study population : 33 patient</detailed_description>
