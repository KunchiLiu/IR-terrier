	<detailed_description>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) non-invasive mean brain stimulation produce change brain excitability . Following series daily rTMS session , modulation neural circuit distant effect may help motor neuropsychiatric symptom PD month time . Recently , FDA approve daily rTMS prefrontal cortex treatment medication-refractory depression demonstration efficacy sham-controlled trial safety profile . Among several small pilot study rTMS PD patient , rTMS either motor cortex prefrontal cortex report show beneficial effect motor mood ( depression ) symptoms serious adverse event . However , relative effectiveness rTMS motor , prefrontal , region mood motor symptom , yet establish PD patient . We propose conduct four-center , blind , sham-controlled , randomize , parallel-group study fixed-dose , high-frequency rTMS 160 PD patient experience depressive symptom despite adequate trial least one antidepressant . Subjects randomize receive rTMS either motor cortex , prefrontal cortex , , neither ( sham-rTMS ) . Subjects receive rTMS 25 minute either prefrontal cortex ( brain region associate mood depression ) , and/or primary motor cortex ( associate motor control ) , and/or sham-rTMS . After 10 day rTMS ( sham ) treatment 2-week period , subject undergo comprehensive assessment motor , mood , cognition quality life first work day last rTMS treatment , 1 , 3 6 month post-treatment . This study directly address expansion rTMS alternative treatment depression PD population provide evidence whether motor cortex stimulation provide additional and/or separate benefit motor symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis PD accord UK Brain Bank Criteria , confirm neurologist expertise movement disorder . Minimum 3 year since formal diagnosis PD , require dopaminergic therapy ( minimum , levodopa and/or dopamine agonist therapy ) . Minimum baseline OFF score motor UPDRS 15 point . Lack feature suggestive atypical parkinsonism , early prominent cerebellar , pyramidal , autonomic dysfunction ; supranuclear gaze palsy ; fall within first year symptom ; hallucination prior initiate dopaminergic agent . No history neuroleptic drug induce parkinsonism past 60 day . Currently optimally treat medication , view treat neurologist , unlikely require antiPD medication adjustment next 6 month . On stable dose medication 30 day ( except antidepressantsâ€” stable least 90 day ) . Lack dementia , view enrol investigator , patient able give proper inform consent . In addition , patient must score least 26 30 screening MMSE . HAMD score &gt; 12 first 17 question scale , despite current use antidepressant ( ) least 90 day , documentation adequate trial antidepressant ( i.e . least 6 week optimal dose ) , documentation intolerability antidepressant . Untreated depression stable dose antidepressant 90 day ( untreated patient need try least one antidepressant past ) . Age 21 year old . Patient meet criterion depressive disorder base either MINI interview ( major depression ) SCID ( minor depression , dysthymia ) . Intracranial metallic body ( e.g . prior neurosurgical procedure ) . Signs symptom increase intracranial pressure . Implanted pacemaker , medication pump , vagal stimulator , deep brain stimulator , TENS unit ventriculoperitoneal shunt . History seizure unexplained loss consciousness . Possible pregnancy . Family history medication refractory epilepsy . History substance abuse within last 6 month . History known structural brain abnormality . History exposure repetitive TMS past ( minimize risk unblinding sham condition ) . History exposure ECT past . Patients suicidal ideation deem investigator significant enough render individual suicidal risk . Patients history hospitalization suicidal ideation/attempts . Patients require hospitalization depression within past six month allow study . If participate subject 's depression worsen study degree hospitalization deem necessary , subject develop significant suicidal ideation , he/she withdrawn study refer psychiatrist treatment . Patients bipolar affective disorder whose depression characterize psychotic feature . Patients history spontaneous hallucination delusion well underlie psychotic disorder ( e.g. , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , delusional disorder ) . The presence visual illusion hallucination deem enrol physician clearly related antiparkinsonian medication allow enrol physician believe stable unlikely require change medication ( i.e. , addition antipsychotic reduction antiparkinsonian drug dosage ) . Patients delusion exclude . Subjects judge clinician investigator dementia ( DSMIV MMSE criterion ) exclude . Subjects judge clinician investigator dementia ( MoCA criterion ) exclude . Subjects unstable medical condition diabetes , cardiac disease , hypertension . Subjects brittle severe motor fluctuation cause severe discomfort OFF medication test Baseline , immediately postTMS , Months 1 , 3 , 6 . Excessive alcohol use take one follow exclusionary medication : Imipramine , Amitriptyline , Doxepin , Nortriptyline , Maprotiline , Chlorpromazine , Clozapine , Foscarnet , Ganciclovir , Ritonavir , Amphetamines ( MDMA , ecstasy ) , cocaine , phencyclidine ( PCP , angel 's dust ) , ketamine , gammahydroxybutyrate ( GHB ) , theophylline , haloperidol .</criteria>
