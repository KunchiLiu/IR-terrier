	<brief_title>Caffeine/Propranolol Intervention Acute Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There screen exam find potential subject eligible main part study . Screening include obtain demographic , migraine history , migraine characteristic , verification subject 's migraine satisfy International Headache Society criterion , migraine medication history success failure rate , medical history . If subject female , need confirm extent medically possible pregnant . Female subject must agree urine pregnancy test do begin research study . If subject woman able become pregnant , expect use effective method birth control prevent expose fetus potentially dangerous agent unknown risk . They must accept risk pregnancy could still result despite responsible use reliable method birth control . They agree notify Dr. Cho soon possible failure proper use birth control method , become pregnant , either may result withdrawn study . Subjects also undergo liver function test well EKG make sure eligible study . Once subject eligibility determine , randomize one 3 study group describe . Neither subject doctor choose group subject subject doctor know group subject . They one three chance place group . Two group active treatment either 400 mg caffeine 40 mg propranolol 1000 mg caffeine 40 mg propranolol . The third group placebo group active medication . Subjects give study kit , include caffeine/propranolol placebo oral medication , treatment booklet , migraine headache diary , pen stopwatch . The study coordinator instruct accurate method diary completion use oral medication placebo pill . Their final visit schedule within 60 day enrollment . They instruct treat one moderate severe migraine attack study medication . They instruct take study medication aura onset presence another adult . In absence aura , instruct take study medication headache onset . Another adult present take study medication ensure safety . In event migraine occur alone , subject instruct take study medication wait next headache adult supervision available . They allow use non-steroidal , anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen naproxen sodium , non-prescription analgesic acetaminophen aspirin , narcotic analgesic oxycontin , oxycodone , triptan ergotamine medication derivative ( Cafergot® , D.H.E. , 45® [ dihydroergotamine mesylate ] , Efcaf® , Ergomar® , Ergostat® , Migranal® , Nasal Spray , Sansert® [ methysergide ] , Wigraine® ) within 24 hour prior dose study medication . Subjects also instruct use caffeine coffee , tea , caffeine contain soda , caffeine contain medication ( Cafcit® , Caffedrine® , Enerjets , Lucidex , No Doz® Maximum Strength , Vivarin® ) within 6 hour prior dose study medication . Subjects record severity headache associate symptom baseline 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 120 minute dose . If migraine resolve worsen 2 hour , allow take # rescue medication # prescribed physician . Subjects continue record severity headache associate symptom 4 , 12 , 24 hour initial dose . Following last entry subject diary 24 hour , ask complete treatment satisfaction questionnaire . They also ask contact Dr. Cho # office review diary completion confirm date final visit . If subject call report migraine within month ( ±7 day ) enrollment , Dr. Cho someone research staff call determine treat migraine . If migraine treat , Dr. Cho study staff interview determine diary appropriately complete ensure adequate information record . Their final visit confirm occur within 30 day treat migraine . If treat migraine study medication within first 30 day enrollment , final visit reschedule within 60 day enrollment date ( ± 7 day ) . At final visit , study coordinator review subject diary completeness accuracy . All study material need return visit . Subjects second EKG make sure medication n't negative effect cardiac function . Subjects give voucher pay parking expense . In addition , data safety monitoring unblinding event first 15 patient complete study . All serious non-serious adverse event analyzed regardless investigator ' assessment causality . Adverse event result death , hospitalization , permanent disability threat life classify serious . The Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) use categorize report adverse event . Someone directly relate research team conduct safety monitoring . If serious adverse event study , study discontinue .</detailed_description>
