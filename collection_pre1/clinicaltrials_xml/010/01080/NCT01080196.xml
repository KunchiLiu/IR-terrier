	<brief_title>Reducing Falls With RENEW Older Adults Who Have Fallen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle atrophy weakness accompany age contributes greatly increase risk incidence fall . Over one-third individual 65 year age old experience fall [ 1,2 ] . In 2006 review [ 3 ] 16 control ( prospective retrospective ) study [ 4-8 ] major factor affect risk identify influential risk factor muscle weakness , deficit balance gait . The rate muscle de-conditioning accelerated inactivity , muscle disuse co-morbid condition [ 9-12 ] . Older individual deficit muscle size , strength power become mobility-limited simply walk mailbox upper limit physical capacity [ 9 ] Hence , improve muscle condition elderly individual high fall risk may decrease risk incidence fall [ 13-18 ] . Muscle condition often require considerable effort , yet many elderly individual lack energetic reserve require high-intensity exercise . Consequently , elderly woman men catch `` downward-spiral '' muscle de-conditioning accelerates myriad risk fall incidence life-threatening fall . We explore safety feasibility high-intensity Resistance Exercise via Negative , Eccentrically-induced Work ( RENEW ) multiple group de-conditioned elderly male female , many characterize at-risk fall due impaired muscle condition , balance , mobility confidence . Compared traditional resistance exercise ( TRAD ) , RENEW novel advantageous RENEW : high-intensity exercise muscle , yet require little effort ( result high level adherence ) ; induces unprecedented muscle conditioning ( size , strength power ) ; lower fall risk ( balance , mobility confidence ) [ 19-23 ] . This study unique timely unknown RENEW 's amplified muscle conditioning translates decrease incidence fall , particularly high risk injurious fall , i.e . fall . Further , RENEW 's long-term sustainability explore . This phase II clinical trial compare effect RENEW vs. TRAD part multi-component exercise fall-reduction program ( MCEFRP ) muscle conditioning ( muscle size , strength , power ) ; fall risk ( balance , mobility confidence ) ; well fall incidence . We anticipate muscle conditioning mediate effect RENEW fall risk fall incidence . As well , sustain benefit RENEW explore . Objective # 1 : Test whether RENEW 's effect different TRAD 's effect muscle conditioning , i.e. , muscle size , strength power . • H1a : RENEW result great increase ( relative TRAD ) whole muscle volume , isometric strength concentric power leg extensor muscle , specifically quadriceps . Objective # 2 : Test whether effect RENEW fall risk mediate muscle conditioning . - H2a : RENEW decrease fall risk ( impaired balance , mobility confidence ) TRAD . - H2b : RENEW 's effect fall risk mediate great muscle conditioning . Objective # 3 : Determine RENEW lower fall incidence TRAD . • H3a : The RENEW intervention result lower fall incidence ( fall near fall ) TRAD via direct influence muscle conditioning via indirect influence decrease fall risk .</detailed_description>
