	<brief_title>Changes Brain Function Patients With Stage I , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To describe change cognitive function among patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer receive front-line chemotherapy measure web-based assessment cognitive function measure HeadMinder Customized Research Tool ( CRT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient experience possible probable acute persistent impairment cognitive function receive chemotherapy measure web-based assessment cognitive function measure HeadMinder CRT . II . To explore association patient-reported neurocognitive function measure Patient Assessment Own Functioning ( PAF ) scale web-based assessment cognitive function measure HeadMinder CRT . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship patient-reported quality life measure FACT-O cognitive function measure web-based patient-reported assessment , respectively . ( Exploratory ) II . To explore whether patient-reported cognitive function web-based assessment cognitive function associate anxiety depression measure Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale . ( Exploratory ) III . To explore change cognitive function use web-assessed ( CRT ) self-reported ( PAF ) assessment , respectively , among patient advanced ovarian cancer ( stage III-IV , optimally debulked disease enrollment ) receive IV compare intraperitoneal treatment . ( Exploratory ) IV . To explore whether cognitive impairment measure web-based assessment associate patient age , hemoglobin , platelet count , patient-reported neurotoxicity symptom measure FACT/GOG-Ntx subscale , body weight . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive standard chemotherapy . Treatment repeat 6 course . Patients complete neurocognitive evaluation ( Patient Assessment Own Functioning scale HeadMinder Custom Research Tool ) quality-of-life assessment ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , FACT-O , FACT/GOG-Ntx subscale ) baseline , fourth course chemotherapy , 3 week sixth course chemotherapy , 6 month sixth course chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
