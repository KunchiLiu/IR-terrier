	<brief_summary>This study do see new approach repair perforate ulcer stomach ( hole stomach ) first part intestine possible . Traditionally , either open operation ( large single incision ) laparoscopic operation ( multiple small camera-guided incision ) use repair perforated ulcer . Over last ten year , surgeon use endoscopic equipment assist perform procedure . It unknown perforated ulcer repair do use endoscope main instrument ( flexible tube video camera insert stomach esophagus ) `` patch '' plug perforation . We patch perforation use standard method use tissue outside stomach . A laparoscopic camera also use assist view . This study intend feasibility study demonstrate endoscopic technique safely perform Hypothesis : The primary outcome successful completion procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Translumenal Endoscopic Omental Patch Closure Perforated Viscus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perforation dangerous complication gastroduodenal ulcer disease . It account 70 % death associate peptic ulcer disease . In addition age concomitant disease , intervention related complication statistically significant predictor death hospital stay . Age , time presentation comorbidities factor influence . If would possible reduce impact procedure relate complication `` second hit '' , may lead decreased morbidity mortality . This pilot clinical study evaluate safety feasibility endoscopic translumenal omental patch closure . Patients clinical diagnosis perforate viscus schedule undergo surgical exploration recruit . Endoscopic translumenal omental patch attempt first patient contraindication . Should prove unsuccessful , surgical team proceed conversion laparoscopic open standard surgical therapy indicate .</detailed_description>
