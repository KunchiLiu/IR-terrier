	<brief_title>Evaluation Noninvasive Diabetes Screening Device Subjects Risk Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial prospective , multi-center , paired data , cohort screen trial . Up 960 subject complete study determine relative accuracy SCOUT DS compare FPG HbA1c test screen abnormal glucose tolerance . All method compare 2 hour value OGTT . An algorithm utilizes skin optical modeling well spectral blood assay data accumulate initial phase study produce risk score abnormal glucose tolerance . This algorithm calculation score integrate SCOUT DS prospective testing . The design require three patient visit clinical site total seven measurement SCOUT device .</detailed_description>
