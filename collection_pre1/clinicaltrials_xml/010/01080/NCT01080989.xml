	<brief_summary>The study project divide two part : ( 1 ) health screen community ( 2 ) clinical diagnosis treatment patient National Referral Hospital ( NRH ) Solomon islands . The health screen include questionnaire , stool parasitic screening blood laboratory test . A total 800 subject participate study . The collected sample venous blood ( 20 ml/per subject ) stool order conduct related test mention . As collection target patient , KMUH cooperate NRH collect two kind blood sample : blood sample confirm malarial case case suspicious Flaviviral , Alpha-viral , Rickettsial , Leptospiral infection . The expected receive case 600 year . The venous blood sample ( 20 ml/per subject ) use conduct related test mention . At time , subject also fill related questionnaire include height , weight , waist line , heath behavior habit , past history , etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>KMUH plan series medical service Solomon Islands expectation health medical standard Solomon Islands improve medical interaction use high-tech medical instrument . By collect data Solomon Islands , KMUH well understand health need , characteristic disease , basic health information Solomon Islanders strategy operation goal improvement explicit KMUH 's medical team . The medical service study project divide two part : ( 1 ) health screen community ( 2 ) clinical diagnosis treatment patient NRH . The health screen include questionnaire , stool parasitic screening blood laboratory test . In questionnaire , height , weight , waist line , health behavior habit , past history investigate . In laboratory test , parasite screening , Malaria rapid check , Flavivirus include dengue virus Japanese virus , seroprevalence Rickettsia , HIV test , Diabetes , gout , cardiovascular risk factor , fungal infection include . A total 800 subject participate study . The collected sample venous blood ( 20ml/per subject ) stool order conduct related test mention . As collection target patient , KMUH cooperate NRH Solomon islands collect two kind blood sample : blood sample confirm malarial case case suspicious Flaviviral , Rickettsial , Leptospiral infection . The expected receive case 600 year . The blood sample confirm malarial case use pathogen identification drug resistance analysis . The blood sample suspicious Flaviviral ( dengue virus , Japanese encephalitis virus ) , Alpha-viral ( Chikungunya virus , Ross river virus ) , Rickettsial , Leptospiral infection use follow test either one , include ICT ( immuno- chromatographic test ) rapid test , ELISA , PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) isolation identification pathogen . The venous blood sample ( 20ml/per subject ) use conduct related test mention . At time , subject also fill related questionnaire include height , weight , waist line , heath behavior habit , past history , etc . For confirmed malarial case , frequency blood draw start diagnose day , 3rd , 7th , 14th , 21st , the28th day treatment , total six time sample . The blood sample use identify malaria pathogen type conduct drug resistance analysis .</detailed_description>
