	<criteria>Patient must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Patient must metastatic disease amenable surgical resection . Patient must measurable disease ( RECIST criterion ) , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension . Patient may previously untreated disease may previously treat meet follow criterion : receive adjuvant gemcitabine therapy &gt; 6 month prior enrollment progression therapy receive prior radiation therapy &gt; 4 week prior study enrollment measurable tumor mass outside radiation field receive prior radiation therapy &gt; 4 week prior study enrollment , measurable tumor mass outside radiation field , receive 5FU radiation sensitizer &gt; 4 week prior study enrollment Patient must &gt; =18 year old . Note : pazopanib contraindicate pediatric population due potential effect epiphyseal growth plate . Patient must ECOG performance status 01 Patient must normal organ marrow function within 14 day study initiation define : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ; patient may transfusion within 7 day screen assessment Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L PT INR ≤ 1.2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) PTT ≤ 1.2 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ; &gt; 1.5 mg/dL , calculate creatinine clearance must ≥ 50 mL/min Urine protein creatinine ratio &lt; 1 ; ≥ 1 , 24hour urine protein must assess must &lt; 1 g order patient eligible Patient must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Eligible patient reproductive potential ( sex ) must agree use adequate contraceptive method . Exclusion Criteria Patient treat agent antagonizes VEGF receptor . Patient receive investigational agent &lt; 28 day prior enrollment . Patient known brain metastasis ; patient exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . In addition , patient brain metastasis may higher theoretical risk cerebral hemorrhage take pazopanib . Patient history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pazopanib , gemcitabine , agent use study . Patient increase risk hemorrhage receive thrombolytic agent within past month , unstable dose anticoagulation , know bleed diathesis . Patient clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may increase risk GI bleeding : Active inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intra abdominal abscess ≤ 28 day prior begin study treatment Patient history one follow cardiovascular condition within past 6 month : Cardiac angioplasty stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease Class III IV congestive heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Patient prolong QT interval , take antiarrhythmic take medication prolong QT Patient poorly control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90 mmHg ) . Note : initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . Patient history cerebrovascular accident , pulmonary embolism , untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month . Patient major surgery , trauma , nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer within 28 day prior first dose gemcitabine and/or study drug ( procedure catheter placement consider major ) OR minor surgery within 14 day prior first dose gemcitabine and/or study drug . Patient significant proteinuria evidence urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1 Patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , cardiac arrhythmia , active second malignancy , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patient pregnant breastfeeding . Pregnant woman exclude study preclinical reproductive toxicity study pazopanib demonstrate reduced female fertility teratogenic effect . Patient known HIVpositive . These patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Patient known alcohol , cocaine , IV drug abuser within 6 month prior enrollment . Patient receive treatment follow anticancer therapy : Radiation therapy , surgery , tumor embolization within 4 week prior first dose pazopanib OR Chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , investigational therapy , hormonal therapy within 28 day five halflives drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose pazopanib . Patient experience ongoing toxicity prior anticancer therapy &gt; grade 1 and/or progress severity . Inclusion Women Minorities Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial .</criteria>
