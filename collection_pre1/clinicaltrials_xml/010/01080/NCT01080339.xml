	<detailed_description>Childhood obesity increasingly common predictive adult type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Recent pediatric study suggest exercise reduces cardiometabolic risk factor . Despite evidence benefit , exercise train prescribed pediatrician traditionally vague , developmentally inappropriate , and/or fraught psychological , financial practical barrier . There recent interest use interactive technology , also term `` exer-gaming '' way translate know positive benefit exercise increase physical activity youth . Initial adult study demonstrate benefit , yet study exer-gaming involve child increase CVD risk . This project involve partnership Children 's Hospital Boston GoKids Boston Youth Fitness Research Training Center UMass Boston , feature interdisciplinary team researcher clinician pediatric cardiology , prevention , nursing , exercise physiology , behavior change . Participants eligible substudy base enrollment pilot project evaluate effect state-of-the-art exercise training facility incorporate late technology-based exercise game ( `` exer-games '' ) Boston Public School elementary child .
