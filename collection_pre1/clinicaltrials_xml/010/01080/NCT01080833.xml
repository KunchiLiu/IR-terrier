	<brief_title>Effect ERCP Mechanical Simulator ( EMS ) Practice Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis # 1 : Trainees offer simulator training addition routine training ( study group ) demonstrate improve clinical outcome compare undergoing routine ERCP training ( control group ) . Hypothesis # 2 : Trainees initially control arm , receive simulator train initial 30 procedure ( delay intervention ) significantly great improvement clinical outcome second phase study ( steep learn curve ) compare initial period . STUDY DESIGN &amp; OUTCOMES - Controlled randomized observational study . - Immediate intervention ( simulator training begin prior trainee ' ERCP rotation ) delay intervention ( simulator training 30 clinical procedure ) study - Primary outcome : diagnostic biliary cannulation deep biliary cannulation success rate Secondary outcome : cannulation time , subjective competency score ( 5-point scale ) grade supervise physician .</detailed_description>
