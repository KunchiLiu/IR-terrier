	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy combination treatment VX-222 telaprevir administer 12 week without peginterferon-alfa-2a and/or ribavirin . The subject enrol study chronically infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype 1 previously receive treatment HCV infection . This study include Investigational Phase Extension Phase . These phase contain Treatment Period Follow-up Period . All subject enrol Investigational Phase study . Subjects fail treatment Investigational Phase option enter Extension Phase point eligible receive peginterferon alfa-2a ribavirin total 48 week . Based evaluation on-treatment safety , pharmacokinetic antiviral data patient arm trial , Vertex may elect enroll two additional treatment arm ( Treatment Arm E Treatment Arm F ) evaluate telaprevir/VX-222-based combination therapy . The component treatment regimens arm select base clinical data emerge four initially-studied regimen . If enact , 25 patient expect enroll additional treatment arm . If Treatment Arm E Treatment Arm F discontinue subject meet certain criterion option enter telaprevir-containing Rollover Phase .
