	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux event generally happen relaxation low esophageal sphincter . This relaxation reflex trigger gastric stimulus . The investigator hypothesize abnormal relaxation gastric wall meal may lead reflux event . To test hypothesis , study design measure gastric accommodation patient undergoing esophageal impedance monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux event happen relaxation low esophageal sphincter relate swallowing , call transient . These transient low esophageal sphincter relaxation ( tLESR ) generally trigger gastric distension physiological purpose vent stomach . The gastric accommodation physiological process gastric fundus actively relaxes meal order accommodate . This study drive hypothesis impairment gastric accommodation may facilitate trigger tLESR , therefore , reflux event . We aim evaluate relation gastric fundic relaxation number gastroesophageal reflux event child . We also aim evaluate relation gastric empty number reflux episode .</detailed_description>
