	<brief_summary>Neurological dysfunction common complication late stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) peripheral nerve system often involved complication . Sensory disturbance paresthesia hypoesthesia predominant symptom uremic polyneuropathy traditionally think uremic polyneuropathy mainly involve large-diameter sensory nerve . However uremic patient abnormal thermal threshold , sensory symptom like numbness , burning , paradoxical heat , cold freezing , pain , frequent symptom autonomic dysfunction suggest small-fiber neuropathy clinical entity patient CKD . But still investigation emphasis change small-fiber nerve CKD , little known characteristic mechanism small-fiber neuropathy CKD . Skin biopsy evaluation epidermal nerve density morphology epidermal nerve subepidermal nerve plexus effective minimally invasive test assessment small-fiber neuropathy . Contact heat evoke potential ( CHEP ) record brain response evoke contact heat stimuli skin non-invasive technique investigate thermo-nociceptive pathway mediate small-fiber nerve . In current study , use integrate approach combine skin biopsy , quantitative sensory testing , autonomic function test , CHEP investigate pathological , psychophysical physiological aspect small-fiber neuropathy patient CKD . The aims current study address follow issue : ( 1 ) change small fiber nerve uremia CKD different stage ; ( 2 ) correlation skin innervation clinical manifestation , thermal threshold , autonomic function ; ( 3 ) influence dialysis therapy , type dialysis therapy , renal transplantation small fiber neuropathy uremia ; ( 4 ) role blood chemical substance , metal , endocrine profile development small-fiber neuropathy ; ( 5 ) relationship small-fiber neuropathy pruritus restless leg syndrome ; ( 6 ) pathological physiological correlate painful symptom skin biopsy CHEP CKD relate neuropathy . The result study provide important insight understanding pathogenesis , prevention new treatment small-fiber neuropathy CKD .</brief_summary>
