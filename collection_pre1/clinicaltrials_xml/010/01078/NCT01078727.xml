	<brief_summary>Improving upper extremity movement function patient stroke one primary goal patient rehabilitation professional . Thermal stimulation ( TS ) first find domestic research group effective facilitate sensory motor recovery patient stroke within month . However , immediate long-term effect TS mechanism brain plasticity patient stroke three month ( golden recovery stage ) remain unknown . Thus , design single-blind randomized control trial investigate immediate long-term effect TS patient stroke subacute chronic stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Thermal Stimulation Upper Extremity Motor Recovery Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study assessor-blinded randomize controlled clinical trial . Participants UE impairment 3 month poststroke randomly assign either experimental ( EXP ) group control group . All participant receive regular conventional rehabilitation program . The EXP group receive additional UE-TS protocol 30 minute day ( 3 days/week 8 week ) ; control group receive TS protocol low extremity ( LE ) . The Brunnstrom 's recovery stage , Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) , Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment Movement ( STREAM ) , Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) , Barthel Index ( BI ) outcome measure administer baseline , 4 week 8 week post inception , one-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
