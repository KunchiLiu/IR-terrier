	<brief_title>Effect Febuxostat Joint Damage Hyperuricemic Subjects With Early Gout</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gout cause high level uric acid body , associate broad range comorbidities include heart disease , chronic kidney disease additional risk factor like obesity high blood pressure . Hyperuricemia , define elevation serum urate level , develop gout urate crystal form supersaturated body fluid settle joint organ . Urate-lowering therapy use treat hyperuricemia patient gout . Current treatment focus initiate urate-lowering therapy hyperuricemic gout patient experience multiple acute gout flare within past year . However , joint damage cause crystal deposition may occur much earlier previously consider . Monosodium urate crystal find present joint people hyperuricemia symptom . The presence monosodium urate crystal would indicate crystal form , stay within joint serum urate level reduce . Lowering uric acid level maintain may reduce acute gout flare episodes possibly halt reduce joint damage patient gout . This study evaluate effect febuxostat joint damage hyperuricemic patient early gout . All patient receive gout flare prophylaxis first 6 month study . Gout flare may also treat throughout study . A variety image technique use evaluate gout . Plain radiograph ( x-rays ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Dual Energy Computed Tomography ( DECT ) utilize study . The modified Sharp/Van Der Heijde score method ( name Drs . Sharp Van Der Heijde ) assessment x-rays validated patient chronic gout use study evaluate erosion joint space narrowing . Participants expect 15 visit include plain radiographic examination 5 visit , 3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) examinations 3 DECT procedure select site .</detailed_description>
