	<brief_summary>Background : - Two important property distinguish heal process skin wound wound mucous membrane mouth ( oral mucosa ) . Although skin oral mucosa tissue similar nature , oral mucosa rapid heal lack scar tissue formation . However , oral wound heal general poorly study , information need determine specific aspects oral environment affect heal process . - Researchers interested identify various factor contribute oral wound heal . Studying process would help researcher explore procedure accelerate heal critically-sized oral lesion form trauma , surgery , radiation therapy , infection , damage mouth . In addition , research scar-free healing could apply mucosal site promote heal minimize unsightly scar may compromise tissue . Objectives : - To identify specific factor enable rapid nearly scar-free heal oral mucosa . Eligibility : - Healthy male volunteer 18 40 year age . - Regular cigarette , cigar , pipe smoker ; occasional smoker smoke 1 day week smoke prior month ; user chew tobacco betel nut ; heavy drinker ( three alcoholic drink per day ) exclude . Design : - Participants medical history examination , provide blood sample start study . - Participants provide oral mucosa sample inside cheek , take use dermal punch . At time , participant provide skin biopsy sample approximately size . After skin oral mucosa sample take , participant divide three group follow-up procedure . - Group 1 : No sample collect . This group help document normal heal process . - Group 2 : A second , slightly large biopsy , include area first biopsy , take day 3 . Both skin oral mucosa biopsy take . - Group 3 : A second , slightly large biopsy take day 6 , similar way describe Group 2 . Both skin oral mucosa biopsy take . - Wounds photographed digital camera day 3 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 15 ; heal monitor schedule clinic visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Two important property distinguish process heal oral mucosa wound skin : rapid heal absence scar tissue formation . This remarkable give apparent similarity two tissue . There , however , prominent difference heal environment , hydration , growth factor availability , inflammatory response , microbial exposure . Knowledge causal contribution factor differential heal response two epithelium mostly anecdotal , oral wound heal generally poorly study . This study seek provide global molecular definition oral wound heal comparison skin . The overall aim identify specific factor enable rapid nearly scar-free heal oral mucosa . Identification physiological molecular determinant widespread implication human oral health . Among others , would provide venue target exploration procedure accelerate heal critically-sized oral lesion form trauma , surgery , radiation therapy , infection , oral pathology , , untreated , lead permanent disability dysfunction . Moreover , pathway and/or molecule identify study may facilitate rapid , scar-less healing could consider application non-oral mucosal site promote heal minimize unsightly scar , may also compromise functional integrity tissue . Hypotheses : - There significant difference gene protein expression wound heal skin oral mucosa . - The recruitment inflammatory cell associate large up-regulation inflammation-associated gene , include cytokine chemokines , epithelial cell skin wound may account difference . - There specific gene program explain presence significant scar skin tissue oral mucosa . OBJECTIVES : The overall objective pilot study proposal establish gene protein expression profile early stage ( 1-6 day ) normal oral wound repair . By compare profile cutaneous wound heal , may able identify molecule exclusive oral wound repair could represent biomarkers heal process serve new therapeutic target pathological wound heal cancer . One specific hypothesis test level expression pro-inflammatory gene network wound-infiltrating keratinocytes constitutes significant difference human oral cutaneous wound transcriptomes . The specific hypothesis develop data obtain recent complementary oral skin wound heal study animal . ELIGIBILITY : Healthy male volunteer age 18 40 enrol study . DESIGN : Oral mucosa sample : A sterile 3-mm dermal punch use create uniform , full-thickness biopsy mucosa cheek occlusal plane . Circular piece tissue approximately 2 mm depth remove day biopsy ( day 1 ) . These subject subsequently randomly group follow : Group 1 : sample collect ; picture take day 3 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 15 ( see Timetable ) . This group help document normal heal process condition present study , include lack scar area select initial wound oral mucosa compare skin . Group 2 : second biopsy take day 3 , include area first biopsy sterile 5 mm punch , follow procedure describe day 0 ; picture take accord schedule set Timetable . This second biopsy enable sample heal area induce first biopsy . By select punch size two millimeter wider take sample concentric first one , assure complete removal area interest . Group 3 : second biopsy take day 6 , respectively , similar way describe Group 2 ; picture take accord Timetable . Skin sample : In parallel oral biopsy , skin biopsy similar size depth oral biopsy subject obtain axillary region follow schedule procedure , include second biopsy group 2 3 . Wounds photograph digital camera healing monitor clinic visit per schedule . The excised tissue case immediately bisect ice ; half sample fix 4 % formaldehyde/PBS embed paraffin standard histology immunohistochemistry , remain half place OCT-filled plastic base mold , flash frozen liquid nitrogen , store 80 ( Infinite ) C process genomic proteomic analysis .</detailed_description>
