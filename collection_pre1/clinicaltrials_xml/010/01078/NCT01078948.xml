	<brief_summary>The project investigate use novel neuromodulatory technique , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) treatment patient major depressive disorder . Hypothesis 1 : Active tDCS improve depressive symptomology significantly great degree sham treatment . Hypothesis 2 : Active tDCS well tolerate free major side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Treatment Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression disorder major clinical economic significance locally internationally . It disorder high prevalence result substantial disease burden health-care cost . Critically , significant percentage patient , usually estimate around 30 % , fail respond standard treatment ( Fitzgerald 2003 ) . Techniques , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , investigate widely treatment disorder , considerable success recent year ( Fitzgerald , Benitez et al . 2006 ; Hasey 2001 ) . However , TMS equipment expensive require specialized application . Additionally , TMS associate side-effects ( e.g . seizure ) . Given depression occur culture country , would considerable value develop low-cost , non-invasive technique apply wide variety setting already show efficacy MDD ( Boggio et al . 2007 ) . The propose study randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled ( i.e. , sham stimulation vs. active tDCS ) , longitudinal , treatment outcome trial . Individuals MDD randomize 1 2 treatment condition . These : 1 . Active 2mA tDCS : condition , 1 stimulator use anodal stimulation leave prefrontal cortex cathodal stimulation right prefrontal cortex . The placement anodal stimulation propose enhance activity leave frontal cortex ; cathode aim reduce activity right prefrontal cortex . 2 . Sham treatment : system setup identical active tDCS , stimulator turn 30 second . A total 15 treatment administer participant 3 week ( one per work day ) . Individuals randomize computer-generated list . Clinical raters patient blind treatment condition . Clinical rating well conduct prior treatment course ( i.e. , 3 week ) . All subject randomize sham treatment offer active treatment end acute treatment phase .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Competent consent Have diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder currently experience Major Depressive Episode confirm SCIDIV Treatment resistant , defined failure achieve clinical response , inability tolerate , least two trial antidepressant medication sufficient dose least 6 week Aged 18 75 . Concomitant medication include : benzodiazepine , mood stabilizer antidepressants anticholinergic allow . Since carbamazepine show interfere effect anodal tDCS , potential participant take suitable inclusion trial .
