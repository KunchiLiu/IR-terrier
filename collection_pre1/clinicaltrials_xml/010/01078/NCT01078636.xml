	<brief_summary>The purpose study build upon information obtain original Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( ADNI1 ) , examine brain image technology use test measure progression mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . ADNI-GO seeks define characterize mild symptomatic phase AD , refer study early amnestic MCI ( EMCI ) . This information aid early detection AD , measure effectiveness treatment future clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project continue work ADNI1 , goal test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , biological marker , clinical neuropsychological assessment combine measure progression mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The goal study determine relationship among clinical , cognitive , image , genetic , biochemical biomarker characteristic stage AD spectrum precedes MCI , mild symptomatic phase AD , refer EMCI . The ADNI-GO model posit AD begin amyloid β ( Aβ ) deposition cortex , lead synaptic dysfunction , neurodegeneration , cognitive/ functional decline . Some leading-edge technology study brain-imaging technique , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , include FDG-PET ( measure glucose metabolism brain ) ; PET use radioactive compound ( F-AV-45 ) measure brain beta-amyloid ; structural MRI . Brain scan show scientist brain 's structure function change AD start progress . Biomarkers cerebrospinal fluid revealing change could identify patient MCI develop Alzheimer 's . Scientists look level beta-amyloid tau cerebrospinal fluid . ( Abnormal amount amyloid tau protein brain hallmarks Alzheimer 's disease . ) All participant ADNI1 normal MCI stage continue follow ADNI-GO . The next step scan analyze brain people EMCI ; 200 EMCI participant enrol narrow gap cognitively normal ( CN ) `` late MCI ( LMCI ) '' participant currently enrol ADNI . The overall impact study increase knowledge concern sequence timing event lead MCI AD , development well clinical imaging/fluid biomarker method early detection monitor progression condition , facilitation clinical trial treatment slow disease progression , ultimately contribute prevention AD .</detailed_description>
