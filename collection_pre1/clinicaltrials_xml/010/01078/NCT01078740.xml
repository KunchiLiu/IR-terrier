	<brief_summary>This pilot study . The purpose study facilitate development new biomarker cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) function use rectal tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) Activity Rectal Tissues From Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CF research advance point small molecule agent develop overcome underlying genetic defect cause CFTR mutation . There critical need develop new sensitive biomarkers CFTR function biochemistry use early phase clinical trial demonstrate biologic effect investigative agent vivo . Intestinal Current Measurement ( ICM ) rectal biopsy sample assay proven sensitive specific CFTR function . This method site investigation particularly attractive , since CFTR express high level rectum , alter disease manifestation , tissue study ex vivo , provide flexibility nature technique detect quantify CFTR activity . This study aid development new biomarkers human rectal tissue use CF clinical trial . Testing compound design restore function disease-causing CFTR gene protein provide opportunity improve standardize technique acquisition measurement CFTR activity rectal biopsy specimen .</detailed_description>
