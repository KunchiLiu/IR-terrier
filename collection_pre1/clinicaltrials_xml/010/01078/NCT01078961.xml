	<brief_summary>This research study involve use two investigational drug : sorafenib bortezomib . Sorafenib design stop growth cell cause change associate cancer . Bortezomib design stop cancer cell get rid waste product . This cause cell build toxic level waste lead cell death . In laboratory , combination sorafenib bortezomib show fight cancer cell well either drug alone . We look determine combination sorafenib bortezomib safe treatment patient advance melanoma . The effectiveness combination also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Expanded Cohort Trial Bortezomib Sorafenib Advanced Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant melanoma , everyone participates receive dose study drug . The dose participant get depend upon number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . - Each treatment cycle last 28 day . Participants take sorafenib orally twice day receive bortezomib out-patient intravenous injection Days 1 , 8 15 every cycle . - At end treatment cycle , participant examine determine whether disease worsen , improve stayed , see experience side effect treatment . The following test do visit : physical examination , vital sign , blood test scan ( repeat every 2 month ) . - Once maximum tolerate dose sorafenib bortezomib determine , additional 12 participant enrol study . This call expansion cohort study . Participants enrol cohort require undergo biopsy tumor lesion start study treatment additional biopsy start study treatment .</detailed_description>
