	<brief_summary>A key challenge management patient Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) early identification patient risk develop severe destructive disease . A good understanding prognostic factor anti-CCP anti-MCV biomarkers , need order well identify patient early Rheumatoid Arthritis risk develop aggressive disease . At present time prevalence one biomarker , namely anti-MCV , unknown Irish Rheumatoid Arthritis population . This study establish prevalence anti-MCV population . A second challenge management Rheumatoid Arthritis patient determination best treatment strategy tailor individual patient 's need . In routine practice , treatment approach base patient history availability clinical parameter , positive anti-CCP status , associate bad prognostic . At present time , impact positive anti-CCP status patient ' management formally study Ireland The propose study provide data prevalence anti-MCV Irish RA population use anti-CCP clinical parameter currently use routine care . In addition , present study evaluate impact know anti-CCP status patient ' management . Associations anti-CCP anti-MCV status clinical outcome measure assess . The result present study significant implication individual patient also societal perspective , since enhance overall understanding application different treatment approach base individual patient ' profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Prevalence Modified Citrullinated Vimentin Anti-body ( Anti-MCV ) Irish Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Population Assess Impact Anti-MCV Anti-cyclic-citrullinated Peptide Antibody ( Anti-CCP ) Status Management Irish Patients With Early RA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results clinical study suggest approximately 73 % patient Rheumatoid Arthritis present evidence erosion within 2 year diagnosis . Early intervention Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug ( DMARD ) therapies show reduce progression disease . Significant difference mean Sharp score observe two year initiation treatment regimen . These data support existence `` therapeutic window '' , rheumatoid process stop retard order prevent articular damage . Importantly , observation constitute premise subsequent research aim evaluate benefit TNF inhibitor patient early aggressive rheumatoid arthritis . The detection soluble biomarkers indicate occurrence active change underlie disease process . Recently , OMERACT group undertake task develop validation criterion biomarkers . Validated biomarkers consider reliable surrogate measure radiological endpoint . C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) recently validate use newly develop criterion ( ACR 2006 ) . Noteworthy , association CRP damage endpoint appear vary base use different anti-rheumatic medication . Other soluble biomarkers , use routine care , soon evaluate criterion . Several biomarkers interest , include serum MMP-3 , urinary CTX-II , serum OPG/RANKL , serum CEC , CPII/C2C ratio , extensively evaluate various clinical study . A recent study evaluate antibody modify citrullinated vimentin ( anti-MCV ) . Predictors/prognostic marker indicate presence change underlie disease process . However , value mainly related reliability predict future change , clinical onset disease , severity disease associate complication . In respect , early indicator future event . Rheumatoid factor ( RFs ) autoantibody direct towards Fc portion IgG . RFs find multiple immunoglobulin isotypes ( IgE , IgM , IgA IgG ) , however , IgM isotype preferentially measure clinical assay . RFs long associate development severity RA . The sensitivity specificity RF diagnosis RA show close 60 % 79 % , respectively . This rather low comparatively prognostic marker . This mainly RF also detect normal healthy individual well various infection rheumatological illness . As result , individual diagnostic value appear unsatisfactory . This may issue patient early undifferentiated arthritis . In regard , IgM RFs show positive 19.3 % RA patient prior onset symptom . Antibodies target determinant result deamination peptidylarginine peptidyl citrulline residues recently receive great deal attention . These include antibody direct cyclic citrullinated peptide ( anti-CCP ) antibody target vivo citrullinated protein , anti-keratin antibody , antiperinuclear factor , anti-citrullinated ( pro ) filaggrin anti-Sa/citrullinated vimentin . The prognostic predictive value anti-CCP antibody extensively review elsewhere . These result indicate anti-CCP antibody highly predictive future development RA healthy individual patient undifferentiated arthritis . A recent study evaluate sensitivity , specificity , prognostic value determination level anti-MCV compare anti-CCP inception cohort patient early RA The finding show analysis anti-MCV yield great sensitivity unchanged specificity compare analysis anti-CCP . And also appear perform good anti-CCP identify poor radiographic prognosis patient early RA . These observation suggest different antibody target citrullinated agent may differ ability predict poor outcome . Collectively , observation indicate predictive value various predictor may enhance combine predictors/prognostic marker disease . Primary Objectives - To describe prevalence anti-MCV Irish RA population - To assess association anti-MCV RF anti-CCP population . - To assess impact know anti-CCP status ( positive negative ) anti-MCV clinical decision-making management patient recently diagnose RA .</detailed_description>
