	<brief_title>A Comparative Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Safety Study Azilsartan Medoxomil Children With Hypertension Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within past 10 year , incidence high blood pressure ( hypertension ) child adolescent increase world . This increase connect part grow number people overweight eat right exercise enough . In young child though , high blood pressure common consequence underlying disease , renal disease . This study look blood pressure medicine call TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) see works child hypertension . Azilsartan medoxomil prodrug convert TAK-536 ( azilsartan ) , blood pressure lower medicine test child . To eligible take part study , child diagnosis hypertension ( primary secondary ) must age 1 year 16 year old ( 17th birthday ) . Each child give one dose azilsartan medoxomil , follow number blood test assessment within 24 hour take azilsartan medoxomil see medication work . Adults hypertension also take part study provide comparison . This study take place 9 site UK USA . A total 20 child hypertension 9 adult without hypertension participate study . This study last 43 day . This include 28 day screen period , 2 day treatment phase follow period . Each participant take part study may request remain hospital one overnight stay course study . Each participant contact telephone 6 day 15 day take azilsartan medoxomil . Takeda decide close Cohort 3 ( participant 1 6 year age hypertension ) enrollment early end study agreement US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Pediatric Committee ( PDCO ) European Medicines Agency . Requests FDA PDCO submit close study without completion enrollment Cohort 3 due difficulty enrol particular patient population . Takeda propose alternative option collect PK data age subset utilizing PK model determine appropriate dos child 1-5 year age lieu complete Cohort 3 . The FDA PDCO agree approach .</detailed_description>
