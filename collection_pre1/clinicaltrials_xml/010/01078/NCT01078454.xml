	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study melphalan dexamethasone see well work without bortezomib treat patient previously untreated systemic amyloidosis . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan dexamethasone , work different way stop growth plasma cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth plasma cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give melphalan together dexamethasone effective without bortezomib treat systemic amyloidosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan Dexamethasone With Without Bortezomib Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Systemic Light-Chain Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare hematologic overall response ( partial response [ PR ] , good PR , amyloid complete hematologic response [ ACR ] , stringent complete response [ sCR ] ) 3 course therapy patient previously untreated systemic light-chain amyloidosis treat melphalan dexamethasone v without bortezomib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ACR rate 3 course therapy completion therapy . II . To evaluate organ response rate 3 course therapy 6 , 9 , 12 month . III . To evaluate treatment-related mortality . IV . To evaluate toxicity . V. To evaluate progression-free overall survival . VI . To evaluate PR good completion therapy . VII . To evaluate time hematologic organ response . VIII . To evaluate duration hematologic organ response . IX . To assess quality life ( QOL ) baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 month therapy , completion therapy , 3 6 month therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine prognostic impact ( 11 ; 14 ) translocation cyclin D1 overexpression response overall survival . II . ( Correlative ) To compare sCR rate determine impact sCR outcome . III . ( Correlative ) To perform descriptive analysis amyloid type proteomic composition amyloid tissue . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord amyloid cardiac stage ( stage I/II vs. good risk stage III ) randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A ( Mel-Dex ) : Patients receive melphalan 0.22 mg/kg orally ( PO ) dexamethasone 40 mg PO day 1-4 every 4 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B ( B-Mel-Dex ) : Patients receive melphalan 0.22 mg/kg PO dexamethasone 40 mg PO day 1-4 bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 every 4 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2 cycle . Patients receive melphalan PO dexamethasone PO day 1-4 bortezomib IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 every 5 week . Treatment repeat every 5 week 6 cycle absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood , urine , bone marrow , fat sample may collect periodically laboratory analysis . Health-related quality life assess periodically , , therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
