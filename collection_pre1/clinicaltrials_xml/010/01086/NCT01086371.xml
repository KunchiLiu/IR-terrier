	<brief_summary>The study conduct determine home-based walk program us RAS ( Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation ) viable effective treatment gait instability people MS.We hypothesize RAS-based home walk program demonstrate significant improvement regular exercise exercise . To test hypothesis compare group difference baseline three week intervention 3 quantitative gait measure 1 standardize MS measurement follow 3 group : RAS walking , RAS walk Other : Walking exercise The secondary goal study determine carry-over effect RAS gait parameter ambulatory patient MS. We hypothesize RAS produce sustain change gait pattern due entrainment process . To test hypothesis , compare gait parameter two week follow cessation intervention baseline last week intervention . The third goal study determine RAS-enhanced exercise transfer improve area upper extremity function and/or cognitive function . We hypothesize participate RAS-based home walk program demonstrate improvement domain area , cognitive upper body function . To test hypothesis compare result Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite ( MSFC ) take baseline end treatment phase three group .</brief_summary>
