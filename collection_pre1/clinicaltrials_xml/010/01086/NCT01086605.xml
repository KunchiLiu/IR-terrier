	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , pixantrone dimaleate , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving pixantrone dimaleate different way may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well pixantrone dimaleate work treat patient HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pixantrone Dimaleate Treating Patients With HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess proportion confirm tumor response dose level pixantrone Secondary - To describe distribution progression-free survival ( PFS ) time patient receive pixantrone - To assess 6-month PFS rate patient receive dose level pixantrone - To describe overall survival distribution patient receive pixantrone - To assess adverse event profile pixantrone treatment patient metastatic breast cancer . - To evaluate quality life patient-reported symptom patient receive study regimen OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize accord prior doxorubicin treatment ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive pixantrone dimaleate IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive pixantrone dimaleate IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study circulate tumor cell analysis CellSearch System mRNA isolation assay . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire use Linear Analogue Self Assessment ( LASA6 ) Patient-Reported Outcomes Version Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( PRO-CTCAE ) baseline periodically study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
