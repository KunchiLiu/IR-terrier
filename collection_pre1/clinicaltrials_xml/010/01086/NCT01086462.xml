	<brief_title>Intravenous Microdose Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Study With 14C-GSK2239633</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The different shape pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile follow administration GSK2239633 rat dog make difficult reliably predict human PK profile . This microdose study provide early readout distribution clearance profile drug man use model potential clinical oral dos . The study conduct use open-label , single dose design one group healthy male volunteer . Each subject receive single intravenous infusion 100ug GSK2239633 ( contain approximately 10kBq [ 14C ] -GSK2239633 ) , administer 15 minute . Subjects attend screen visit within 30 day prior Day 1 receive single dose infusion study drug Day 1 . Blood urine sample take 48 hour pharmacokinetic total radioactivity analysis , safety tolerability monitor . Subjects discharge Day 3 follow-up telephone call make 4-10 day post-dose .</detailed_description>
