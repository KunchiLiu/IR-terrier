	<brief_summary>Background : - Paclitaxel chemotherapy drug commonly use treat different type cancer . However , cancer tumor become resistant paclitaxel , result fail accumulate sufficient concentration paclitaxel kill cancer cell . Researchers interested study whether tumor become resistant paclitaxel , must possible see much paclitaxel absorb tumor cell . - 18F-Fluoropaclitaxel ( FPAC ) form paclitaxel modify slightly radioactive order show positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . By inject small amount ( much less used treat tumor ) radiolabeled drug body , researcher hope use PET scan evaluate amount drug absorb solid tumor . Because FPAC best use study tumor locate diaphragm , subject study tumor near diaphragm . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness FPAC radiological evaluation chemical . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose breast , adrenal , renal , lung cancer tumor locate someone body least 1 centimeter diaphragm . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , blood test , image study direct study researcher . - Participants receive single dose FPAC , follow series PET scan . Regular scan perform 3 hour dose FPAC . - Participants also single dose conventional radiotracer , follow series PET scan . The result two set scan compare information previous image study participant ' tumor ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study F-18 Paclitaxel ( FPAC ) PET Evaluating Drug Delivery Solid Tumors Breast , Lung , Renal , Adrenal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Paclitaxel commonly use chemotherapeutic tumor become resistant failing accumulate sufficient concentration agent lethal cell . - A noninvasive imaging test could determine uptake paclitaxel tumor - The ability non-invasively predict chemotherapeutic uptake solid tumor could help select patient likely respond treatment , estimate drug concentration within tumor possibly aid development improve drug delivery system drug resistance evasion strategy . - The PET department NIH develop efficient procedure fluorination paclitaxel [ 18F ] -labeled paclitaxel ( FPAC ) study biodistribution rat mice . - Initial preclinical data show biodistribution FPAC similar paclitaxel . It propose uptake kinetics FPAC vivo use PET image representative uptake kinetics paclitaxel - First human study perform PI ( Kurdziel , KA ) Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond VA three normal volunteer three breast cancer patient adverse event . Human dosimetry estimate obtain . - PET/CT image FPAC permit quantitation solid tumor uptake agent , turn parallel paclitaxel solid tumor kinetics . - The physiological distribution agent limit use diaphragm . Thus , lung breast cancer , tend sensitive taxanes , target tumor study . Adrenal renal tumor , tend insensitive taxanes include negative-control tumor . Primary Objectives : - Determine FPAC uptake tumor different uptake normal background tissue - Determine safety FPAC administration Eligibility : - Subjects must 18 year old inclusion study - Subjects must histologically prove breast , adrenal , renal lung cancer lesion outside abdomen pelvis great equal 1cm - Subjects may receive investigational agent 24 hour follow FPAC injection . - Subjects must ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) - Subjects must NOT pregnant - When applicable , documented history prior chemotherapy radiation therapy responses treatment must available . Design : In protocol , plan stratify enrollment 2 group , enrol 15 subject arm : subject tumor type historically sensitive paclitaxel therapy ( lung breast cancer ) subject tumor generally responsive paclitaxel therapy ( adrenal renal ) . Subjects undergo regional dynamic FPAC PET/CT follow static whole body image . All participant undergo FDG PET/CT ( outside study permit submit DICOM format ) Follow-up FDG PET/CT may perform . ( follow least 1 cycle therapy ) , applicable . If target lesion surgically resect , post-treatment scan perform . Subject expect progress standard investigational therapeutic intervention ( define protocol ) . Data regard clinical imaging response therapy collect available . If previous biopsy specimen available , IHC know drug transporter also perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must history histologically cytologically confirm breast , lung , adrenal renal cancer tumor diaphragm great equal 1 cm Subjects must 18 year old inclusion study . Subjects must sign write informed consent document accordance institutional guideline . If female , subject must postmenopausal minimum two year , surgically sterile , negative pregnancy test within 24 hour prior tracer injection There study relate limitation regard previous radiation chemotherapy . Subjects must ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) Subjects must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within less equal 2.5 time institutional limit OR &lt; 3.0 mg/dl patient Gilbert syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( &lt; 5 time ULN patient know hepatic metastasis ) When applicable , documented history prior chemotherapy radiation therapy responses treatment must available . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects may receive investigational agent 24 hour prior follow FPAC injection Subjects must NOT receive radiation therapy target lesion less equal 8 week prior FPAC injection Subjects must NOT surgery near target lesion less equal 4 week prior FPAC injection Subjects history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition F18 fluoropaclitaxel ( i.e . Taxol ) Subjects severe claustrophobia ( relieved oral anxiolytic ) condition would make unable lie still duration study Subjects uncontrolled intercurrent illness psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Subjects pregnant lactate suspect might pregnant . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother FPAC , breastfeed discontinue mother receive FPAC .</criteria>
