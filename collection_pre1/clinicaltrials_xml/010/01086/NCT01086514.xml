	<brief_summary>Breast tumor normally see mammography ultrasound without use dye size extent tumor may hard see . Currently , initial mammography , many patient undergo bilateral breast MR stage local tumor . It able detect anatomic abnormality also evaluate change development new blood vessel , occurs development cancer . MRI extremely sensitive detects unsuspected disease 25 % patient , affect treatment . It also detect unsuspected cancer breast patient . However , MRI expensive , always available , patient unable undergo MRI due presence pacemaker , clip , claustrophobia . Dual Energy Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography ( DE CEDM ) investigational procedure use non-standard contrast regular digital mammography exam change give need dual energy image . DE CEDM FDA approve . It hope DE CEDM also able detect unknown tumor also detect new blood vessel . It less expensive MRI , could available patient , do patient pacemaker clip . Claustrophobia problem . We plan see ( DE CEDM ) help u good see breast tumor size breast tumor . We also want see DE CEDM detect additional unsuspected disease breast know tumor breast without know tumor .</brief_summary>
