	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiosurgery send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth glioblastoma block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy irinotecan hydrochloride work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiosurgery together bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give radiosurgery together bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride work treat patient recurrent glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiosurgery Plus Bevacizumab Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival patient recurrent GBM treat bevacizumab , irinotecan radiosurgery SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity combination bevacizumab , irinotecan radiosurgery . II . To evaluate progression-free survival patient treat bevacizumab , irinotecan radiosurgery . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30 minute day 1 15 . Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV day 1 15 begin course 2 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo radiosurgery 10-14 day begin bevacizumab . After completion study treatment , patient follow 18 month .</detailed_description>
