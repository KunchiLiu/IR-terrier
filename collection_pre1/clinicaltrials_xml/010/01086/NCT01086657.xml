	<brief_summary>Background : - New vaccine avian influenza , also know `` bird flu , '' develop require test determine safe effective whether side effect . Researchers interested test two experimental avian influenza vaccine see whether safe , side effect vaccine , body 's immune response differs response different vaccination schedule . One vaccine inactivate vaccine ( make kill weakened influenza ) one DNA vaccine allow body use vaccine make immune system response specific part avian influenza protein . Objectives : - To determine safety potential side effect two experimental vaccine avian influenza . - To evaluate whether time two experimental vaccine injection affect immune response vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 60 year age . Design : - Participants randomly divide ( chance ) six group receive two injection vaccine different interval . One group receive inactivate vaccine , group receive DNA vaccine follow inactivated vaccine different interval ( e.g. , 4 week , 8 week , 12 week , 16 week 24 week later ) . - Participants remain clinical center least 30 minute vaccination . A day injection , participant contact staff telephone clinic visit . Participants also ask complete diary card home 5 day keep track temperature change , injection site skin change , effect . - Four week first injection , participant return clinic visit provide blood sample test . - Two week second injection , participant return clinic visit provide blood sample ( collect apheresis ) provide information immune response vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An Open-Label , Randomized Phase I Study Healthy Adults Safety Immunogenicity Prime-Boost Intervals Monovalent Influenza Subunit Virion ( H5N1 ) Vaccine , A/Indonesia/05/2005 ( Sanofi Pasteur , Inc ) , Administered Alone Following Recombinant DNA Plasmid ( H5 ) Vaccine , VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP ( VRC , NIAID ) Study Design : This Phase I , randomize , open-label study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity prime-boost vaccination regimen influenza virus hemagglutinin H5 . One group receive A/Indonesia/05/2005 ( inactivate H5N1 ) vaccine prime boost , group receive VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP ( DNA ) vaccine prime inactivated H5N1 boost various boost interval . The VRC 310 study provide data different prime-boost schedule identify whether homologous heterologous schedule result good antibody response well interval time vaccination associate best immune response . The hypothesis study regimens safe human administration elicit antibody T cell response H5 protein . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability investigational vaccine regimen , dose 4 mg DNA vaccine 90 microg inactivate H5N1 , healthy adult . Secondary exploratory objective relate immunogenicity study vaccine regimens identification interval prime boost high frequency strong immune response . Product Description : The inactivated H5N1 vaccine monovalent subunit virion vaccine , A/Indonesia/05/2005 clade 2 , manufacture Sanofi Pasteur , Inc ( Swiftwater , PA ) . Vaccine vial supply 90 microg/0.5mL . The VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP vaccine develop manufactured VRC , NIAID compose single closed-circular DNA plasmid encodes H5 protein CMV/R promoter . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each vaccination administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle use needle syringe H5N1 vaccine Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) DNA vaccine . Subjects : A total 60 healthy adult , age 18-60 year enrol . Study Plan : Subjects simultaneously randomize equally one 6 group . Subjects clinicians blind group assignment Day 0 follow completion enrollment . At point enrollment randomly assign regimen become known subject clinician . Subjects receive two injection schedule show schema . The protocol require 5 6 clinic visit , depend upon group , telephone follow-up contact first study injection 24 week second study injection . Additional optional visit may conduct study week 48 72 collect blood evaluation immune response durability . Study Duration : Each participant complete clinical follow 24 week second vaccination . Duration expect time study vary 28 48 week depend upon Group , may extend 72 week enrollment subject agree complete optional research blood drawas .</detailed_description>
