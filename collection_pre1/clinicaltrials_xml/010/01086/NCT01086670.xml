	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people cerebral palsy ( CP ) spastic diplegia , affect legs cause difficulty leg movement walking . Research show exercise help CP learn move arm well , research need determine whether exercise program improve leg movement people CP . - Walking treadmill help physical therapist improve treatment outcome individual spinal cord injury . Many child CP already physical therapy still trouble walk leg coordination . Two kind exercise machine , stationary bicycle elliptical machine , use home , may able help child CP walk good move legs well . Objectives : - To see child cerebral palsy ( CP ) move legs differently child without CP . - To see exercise program improve leg coordination child CP . Eligibility : - Children 5 17 year age either spastic diplegia CP healthy volunteer . Design : - Children able willing magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan start end study . - During Part I study , participant demonstrate leg muscle function follow test : - Measurement leg size movement - Combined camera motion study electrical impulse evaluation assess well participant walk ( without assistive device , need ) - Leg movement test exercise bicycle elliptical machine - Tests leg muscle strength , stiffness , effectiveness - Ultrasound scan leg muscle - Parents participant complete computer-based questionnaire child motor ability . - A small group participant continue Part II study , involve regular exercise 20 minute day , 5 day week , 3 month , stationary bicycle elliptical trainer . Half group start exercise program immediately first part study , half wait 3 month begin exercise program . - During Part II , participant return clinical center two set test evaluation perform Part I .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Our primary objective : 1 ) characterize compare lower extremity motor coordination child cerebral palsy ( CP ) across mobility level child without CP ; 2 ) evaluate effect two home-based exercise program motor coordination , well physical , functional neurological outcome child CP . We hypothesize child CP exhibit significant coordination deficit compare without CP exercise program lead significant improvement outcomes . Study Population : Objective 1 include 60 ambulatory child spastic diplegic CP ( 20 three mobility level ) 20 child without CP within age range . Forty ( 40 ) child CP participate Objective 2 ; 20 exercise group . Design : In Objective 1 , multiple measure take single point time compare across three CP control group . Children CP Objective 1 invite consecutively participate exercise program ( Objective 2 ) , enrollment complete . Participation Objective 2 last 6 month . Subjects randomly assign use one two novel low extremity exercise device : motor-assisted cycle elliptical trainer . Children exercise 20 minute , 5 day week 12 consecutive week . The major goal increase ability cycle step rapid pace ( target goal 40 RPM ) , resistance add speed goal attain thereafter progress gradually . The timing exercise period ( immediate vs. delay 3 month ) also randomly assign allow assessor mask group assignment . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome difference ( Objective 1 ) pre post-exercise change ( Objective 2 ) coordination measure fast active ( voluntary ) cadence device . Additional coordination measure include cadence free speed , variability cadence , EMG reciprocation vs. synchronization . Selective Control Assessment Lower extremity ( SCALE ) , strength spasticity test ultrasound measure muscle size assessed time point . These compare across group two exercise program . Functional outcome include gait speed two validate computer-based questionnaire . Neural outcome include select measure gray white matter connectivity assess fcMRI DTI , respectively .</detailed_description>
