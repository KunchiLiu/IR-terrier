	<brief_summary>Omacor®/Lovaza® effective , safe mix PO-3A , drug currently approve Federal authority drug management post-infarction patient high blood triglyceride . Given grow length CAD progression , pertinent many patient yield extra benefit Lovaza® top aggressive antiplatelet regimens statin due severity vascular disease . Therefore , mild antiplatelet property PO-3A highly desirable attractive commodity medication . The investigator believe Omacor®/Lovaza® ideally position chronic management CAD safe , efficient , `` gentle '' agent harmful interaction statins aspirin . The investigator hypothesize addition Omacor may add mild antiplatelet protection CAD patient . The study objective : - To assess ex vivo effect Omacor® platelet function patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . - To compare ex vivo platelet-related effect 7 14 day therapy Omacor statin combination versus statin alone patient chronic stable coronary heart disease . - To establish relation change platelet activity ( ) lipid profile prove additional benefit Omacor® top statin aspirin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In term incidence , prevalence , morbidity , economic cost , coronary artery disease represent number 1 public health concern . Omacor®/Lovaza® effective , safe mix PO-3A , drug currently approve Federal authority drug management post-infarction patient high blood triglyceride . Despite significant progress prevention treatment vascular disease Western World past two decade , national statistic indicate incidence prevalence heart disease increase steadily . Given grow length CAD progression , pertinent many patient yield extra benefit Lovaza® top aggressive antiplatelet regimens statin due severity vascular disease . Therefore , mild antiplatelet property PO-3A highly desirable attractive commodity medication . We believe Omacor®/Lovaza® ideally position chronic management CAD safe , efficient , `` gentle '' agent harmful interaction statins aspirin . Also consider low clinical incidence aspirin-induced interaction class drug , Lovaza® may fit nicely standard cocktail diabetes , hypertension , depression , arrhythmia , heart failure management CAD patient , expand drug utilization . However , platelet-related effect Lovaza® top aspirin statin patient stable coronary disease know , may important due high incidence aspirin resistance heavy burden thrombin activation patient . We large pool patient document CAD ( 300-350/annum ) , able enroll relatively large amount quality patient fast .</detailed_description>
