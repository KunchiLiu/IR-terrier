	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension ( SSc-PAH ) serious , life-threatening manifestation systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) , autoimmune disease connective tissue characterize scarring ( fibrosis ) atrophy skin , joint tendon , skeletal muscle , internal organ , immunological disturbance . One-year survival patient SSc-PAH range 50-81 % . There currently cure SSc-PAH treatment limit vasodilator therapy use form PAH . In recent study , immunotherapy show effective treat SSc-interstitial lung disease , another serious , life-threatening manifestation SSc . In addition , compel pre-clinical data anecdotal clinical report suggest modulation immune system may effective strategy treat SSc-PAH . To test approach , trial determine rituximab , immunotherapy , mark beneficial effect clinical disease progression , minimal toxicity , patient SSc-PAH compare placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Treatment Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( SSc-PAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center , randomized trial evaluate effect rituximab disease progression subject SSc-PAH receive concurrent stable-dose standard medical therapy prostanoid , endothelin receptor antagonist , and/or phosphodiesterase 5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor . The study focus assessment clinical response safety measure longitudinally . In addition , effect treatment rituximab underlie immune mechanism associate B-cell dysregulation pathogenic autoantibody response disease investigate . 1000 mg rituximab placebo administer two IV infusion give two week apart . Clinical assessment sample collection occur monthly visit Week 48 . If participant recover B cell Week 48 , B cell study conduct quarterly reconstitution document 2 year initial treatment . This trial include sub-study , entitle `` Right Ventricular Response Rituximab Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sub-study '' ( RESTORE Sub-study ) . The objective RESTORE sub-study evaluate therapeutic effect rituximab right ventricle patient SSc-PAH . Changes right ventricular end diastolic volume index ( RVEDVI ) stroke volume ( SV ) determine cardiac MRI use surrogate right ventricle function prognosis . Enrollment RESTORE sub-study parallel main trial . Twenty patient treatment arm , distribute among participate site , recruit sub-study . Each patient study baseline ( i.e . prior initiation study drug ) 24 week time discontinuation . In addition data collection test specify main trial , participant RESTORE undergo comprehensive cardiac MRI evaluation . All main trial study inclusion exclusion criterion apply , well additional exclusion criterion pertain RESTORE sub-study : 1 ) know hypersensitivity Gadolinium ; 2 ) inability tolerate cooperate MRI ; 3 ) morbid obesity ; 4 ) presence metallic object pacemaker .</detailed_description>
