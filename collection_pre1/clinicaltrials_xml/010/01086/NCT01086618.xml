	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether chemotherapy effective give alone together surgery treat patient colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II/III trial study well chemotherapy work compare surgery follow chemotherapy treating patient metastatic colorectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Surgery Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine whether overall survival improve patient asymptomatic , unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer treat chemotherapy alone versus surgery follow chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( control arm ) : Patients receive systemic chemotherapy accord standard local practice . Patients develop symptom primary tumor receive treatment require include surgery , indicate . - Arm II ( experimental arm ) : Patients undergo surgery discretion surgeon . Beginning 8 week completion surgery , patient receive chemotherapy accord standard local practice . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) baseline periodically completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .
