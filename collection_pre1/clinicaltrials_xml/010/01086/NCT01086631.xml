	<brief_summary>Background : - Autoimmune retinopathy ( AIR ) inflammatory condition patient immune system attack eye cause vision loss . Patients AIR generally treat immunosuppressive agent treat eye inflammation ; however , standard treatment disease still develop . - Rituximab , immunosuppressive agent , monoclonal antibody direct part immune system may important cause AIR . Rituximab approve treatment non-Hodgkin lymphoma rheumatoid arthritis , approve treatment AIR . Researchers interested determine whether rituximab may use treat AIR . Objectives : - To investigate safety , tolerability possible efficacy rituximab treatment AIR . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose AIR visual acuity 20/200 good least one eye . Design : - Before start study , participant screen medical history , immunization record , series eye examination , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram , blood test . - Participants receive maximum two cycle rituximab 18-month study . Each cycle involve two separate intravenous infusion rituximab give 2 week apart . - Participants return clinic 6 week first cycle rituximab safety visit , include routine eye physical examination . They also provide blood sample study . - After safety visit , participant return every 3 month follow-up visit . - At 6-month visit , participant successfully partially respond rituximab receive another cycle treatment . Those respond receive another cycle , continue monitored end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Autoimmune retinopathy ( AIR ) ophthalmic disorder autoantibody damage retina component , cause progressive vision loss . AIR establish treatment , systemic immunosuppression show favorable response . Rituximab immunosuppressive agent bind specifically B lymphocytes . The objective study investigate safety rituximab effective treatment AIR . Study Population : Five participant AIR visual acuity 20/200 good least one eye receive rituximab . AIR must confirm immunohistochemical demonstration serum anti-retinal antibody normal , unfixed , frozen rhesus monkey human retina , well visual field electroretinography ( ERG ) change . Up seven participant may enrol , order obtain five participant include analysis participant withdraw prior receive rituximab . Design : The study duration 18 month . Rituximab administer cycle consist two separate rituximab infusion 1,000 mg , two week apart . Participants receive first rituximab cycle baseline evaluate second cycle six month later . Treatment success define experience great 25 % improvement ERG response amplitude great 3 decibel ( dB ) improvement mean deviation Humphrey Field Analyzer [ HFA ( 30-2 ) ] improvement threshold value great 0.5 log exist scotoma great 25 % improvement area scotoma Goldmann Visual Field ( GVF ) assessment compare baseline . As result , participant could receive maximum two cycle study . Participants return clinic 6 week 3 month first infusion cycle safety visit . Study visit continue every three month study duration . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome number participant meet definition treatment success within six month baseline . Secondary efficacy outcome include change visual acuity , number treatment successes 9 12 month , number partial responder 6 , 9 12 month , change ERG visual field demonstrate HFA ( 30-2 ) GVF , change optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , change fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , change serum anti-retinal autoantibody anti-retinal antibody staining , change color vision , positive visual symptom nyctalopia change participant quality-of-life assess NEI visual function questionnaire . For participant great equal 2 ERG measurement available prior enrollment , attempt make compare rate decline pre-study period rate decline post-enrollment period . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity , adverse event , infection proportion participant loss great equal 15 ETDRS letter score .</detailed_description>
