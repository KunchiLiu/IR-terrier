	<brief_summary>Background : - National Cancer Institute Protocol 04-C-N191 , also know Costa Rica Vaccine Trial , double-blind control study effectiveness experimental human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine prevent cervical cancer young woman Costa Rica . Costa Rica part first large study show association HPV cervical cancer , study contribute greatly understanding association . The woman participate vaccine trial Costa Rica reach end follow-up period offer vaccine trial protocol , result offer chance complementary vaccination HPV , hepatitis A , hepatitis B . Objectives : - To offer participant Costa Rica Vaccine Trial vaccine receive mask portion trial ( HPV vaccine hepatitis A vaccine ) hepatitis B vaccination . - To collect information exposure know suspected risk factor HPV infection cervical cancer woman receive vaccination HPV crossover . Eligibility : - Women participate National Cancer Institute Protocol 04-C-N191 . Design : - All participant offer vaccination hepatitis B . - Women receive hepatitis A vaccine trial offer vaccination HPV . - Women receive HPV vaccine trial offer vaccination hepatitis A . - Appropriate vaccination ( include combine hepatitis A hepatitis B vaccine ) available reduce number injection participant ask receive . - All vaccine give accord manufacturer 's specification appropriate length time vaccine dos .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crossover Vaccination Women Previously Randomized Into Protocol 04-C-N191</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since mid 1980 , Division Cancer Epidemiology Genetics National Cancer Institute collaboration investigator Costa Rica conduct study regard cervical cancer HPV infection . The first effort case control study Costa Rica one Latin American country include , first large epidemiological study show association HPV cervical cancer . The second study , consist 10,049 woman population-based cohort , Guanacaste cohort , carry 1993 2004 , greatly contribute understanding natural history HPV infection relationship precancerous cervical lesion . The profound knowledge natural history HPV infection cervical neoplasia Guanacaste , Costa Rica together promise result different HPV vaccine trial lead National Cancer Institute , collaboration investigator Costa Rica , launch community-based randomized phase III clinical trial evaluate efficacy virus-like particle HPV vaccine ( henceforth refer Costa Rica Vaccine Trial ( CVT ) ) . The main objective Costa Rica Vaccine Trial evaluate efficacy candidate vaccine prevent persist HPV-16/18 infection relate histopathologically confirm CIN2+ lesion among accord protocol subcohort overall population enrol study . In contrast , objectives protocol aim offer beneficial complementary vaccination woman enrol trial additional objective collect biological specimen woman receive HPV-16/18 vaccine complement information obtain mask phase trial . As additional objective , propose collect information regard exposure know suspected risk factor HPV infection cervical cancer biological specimen crossover phase complement collect masked phase Costa Rica Vaccine Trial . Collection risk factor information biological specimen crossover phase restrict woman receive vaccination HPV 16/18 crossover . These sample permit complete comprehensive evaluation vaccine immunogenicity . Also , specimen allow ancillary analysis study ( e.g. , natural history HPV infection acquisition/clearance ) assist ongoing effort evaluate longer-term impact HPV-16/18 vaccination .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible receive crossover vaccination , participant must fulfill follow inclusion criterion : Participation Status : Women previously randomize HPV16/18 vaccine trial 04CN191 , also know Costa Rica Vaccine Trial . Planned Residence : Residents Guanacaste Puntarenas Province willingness visit one study clinic participation . Consent : Written inform consent obtain prior enrollment crossover protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The follow criterion check potential participant time enrollment . If apply , participant include study . History ( ) allergic reaction ( e.g. , difficulty breathe ) receipt vaccine , ( b ) hypersensitivity latex . History vaccine related adverse event vaccination phase , discretion investigator , preclude vaccination crossover phase . Are receive vaccination Cervarix , sexually experience childbearing potential ( i.e. , surgically sterilize ) , unwilling use effective method birth control 30 day vaccination 60 day last Cervarix vaccination ( approximately 9 month ) . Acceptable form birth control include abstinence , surgical sterilization , hormonal contraceptive ( e.g. , oral , injectable , implant , patch ) , intrauterine device , diaphragm condom . History chronic condition per attend doctor opinion precludes receive vaccination ( e.g. , proper treatment available participant unwilling stay proper treatment ) . The participant diagnose autoimmune illness ( per specific requirement INCIENSA IRB ) . The vaccine vaccine participant interested receiving contraindicate case .</criteria>
