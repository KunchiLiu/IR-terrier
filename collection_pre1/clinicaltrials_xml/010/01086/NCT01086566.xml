	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety compare body react 2 different strength Clade ( specific type H5N1 virus ) 2 H5N1 flu vaccine give single vaccination high dose ( 90 mcg ) low dose ( 15 mcg ) volunteer receive least 2 dos Clade 1 H5N1 vaccine , previous National Institute Health study never receive H5N1 vaccine ( naïve ) . Previously vaccinate subject ( study 04-0063 , 05-0090 , 05-0127 ) receive either 15 90 mcg H5N1 vaccine . Multiply boost volunteer participate study 05-0043 receive Clade 1 3 vaccine , receive dose ( 15mcg ) . Vaccine naïve subject receive 2 dos vaccine ( 15 90 mcg ) separate 28 day . Blood sample collect . 115 volunteer age 18-64 may participate study related procedure approximately 7 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cellular Humoral Immune Response Primary Secondary Immunization With Subvirion H5N1 Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In response steadily increase number report human infection avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) viruses , world-wide effort develop test potential candidate vaccine avian virus pandemic potential . The study conduct laboratory blind assessment humoral cellular immune response A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine three population : healthy adult previously receive clade 1 H5 vaccine Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) -sponsored study ; healthy adult recipient prime-boost regimen represent two clade ; healthy adult previous H5 vaccination risk H5 exposure . Primed subject randomize receive single dose either 15 mcg 90 mcg A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine . Multiply boost subject participate study 05-0043 , previously receive A/HK/97 ( Clade 3 ) A/VN/04 ( Clade 1 ) vaccine . Because small number subject available , randomized receive dose vaccine . Unprimed subject randomize receive 2 dos 15 mcg 90 mcg A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine separate 28 day . In group , sera peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain prior day 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 dose . Primed multiply boost subject also sera PBMC obtain day 56 . All group make final study visit 6 month follow last dose vaccine ( day 180 prim boosted subject day 208 unprimed subject ) . Approximately 115 subject age 18 64 participate study . The primary objective determine safety administration A/Indonesia/05 subvirion vaccine administer healthy , prim unprimed adult . The secondary objective : determine effect prim clade 1 vaccine antibody responses revaccination clade 2 vaccine . The tertiary objective determine effect prim repertoire phenotype B T cell generate response vaccination ; evaluate whether pre-existing immunity seasonal influenza virus impact specificity magnitude cluster differentiation marker ( CD ) 4 T cell response H5 vaccination describe kinetics cellualr immune response subvirion H5N1 vaccinatin prim unprimed individual . The primary endpoint reactogenicity , adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) information , solicit in-clinic via memory aid . The secondary endpoint : level HAI antibody recognize A/Indonesia/05 ( Clade 2 ) , A/Vietnam/04 ( Clade 1 ) representative Clade 2 subclade virus , level neutralize antibody assessed neutralization test use rgA/Indonesia/5/05 virus prior Days 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 vaccination . This study link DMID protocol 04-063 , 05-0090 , 05-0043 05-0127 .</detailed_description>
