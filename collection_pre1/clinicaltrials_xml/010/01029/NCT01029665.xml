	<brief_title>Early Childhood Follow-up Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) relatively rare malformation , see approximately 1 3000-5000 live birth . The overall survival infant bear CDH range 50-70 % despite continuing advance prenatal diagnosis post-natal medical surgical care . Infants CDH remain one complex group patient care - intensive care nursery hospital discharge . Several study show CDH survivor predictable pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiac , neurologic morbidity . In particular , CDH survivor increase risk growth nutrition difficulty , include feed problem , symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux , failure thrive . They also likely suffer chronic lung disease , bronchial hyperreactivity , pulmonary hypertension . In addition , significant number CDH survivor show evidence neurocognitive delay , hear impairment , behavioral disorder follow-up study . Most outcome study CDH survivor focus 18-36 month follow-up period . However , paucity literature longer-term , school-age outcome child . In order might better understand impact current CDH management protocol , imperative determine whether cognitive delay morbidity note patient early age transient nature , persist throughout childhood . It also crucial develop predictive model understand patient CDH undoubtedly develop long-term neurodevelopmental impairment . Collecting share knowledge broad community Neonatal Intensive Care provider manage infant CDH ultimately help guide therapeutic strategy intensive care nursery parent make informed decision aggressiveness care may optimize outcome unique patient population .</detailed_description>
