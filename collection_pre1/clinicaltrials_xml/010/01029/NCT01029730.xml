	<brief_summary>The goal multi-center Phase II study add bortezomib highly active regimen bendamustine rituximab . In study , bortezomib administer weekly schedule ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 ) add bendamustine/rituximab give 4-week cycle . This combination use standard bendamustine dosing schedule , convenient 5-week regimen 3 drug currently study .</brief_summary>

The biopsy must fulfill one follow criterion : Follicular lymphoma , grade 1 2 Marginal zone lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma ( circulate lymphocyte count must &lt; 5,000 ) Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 2 . At least one follow criterion must meet : Presence symptom related lymphoma . These include classic Bsymptoms ( fever [ &gt; 38°C ] unclear etiology , night sweat , weight loss great 10 % within prior 6 month ) lymphomarelated symptom ( fatigue , pain , etc. ) . Large tumor mass ( bulky disease ) characterize lymphomas diameter 3 cm three region lymphoma diameter &gt; 7 cm one region Presence lymphomarelated complication , include narrow ureter bile duct , tumorrelated compression vital organ , lymphomainduced pain , cytopenia related lymphoma/leukemia , splenomegaly , pleural effusion , ascites Hyperviscosity syndrome due monoclonal gammopathy 3 . The lymph node biopsy lymphoma pathology specimen CD20+ Bcells . 4 . AnnArbor Stage 2 ( noncontiguous ) , 3 , 4 disease . 5 . No previous systemic treatment lymphoma . Patients may single course radiation therapy limited field ( i.e. , exceed two adjacent lymph node region ) . 6 .

An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 . 8 . Adequate hematologic function ≤7 day prior start study treatment : Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000/µL Platelet count ≥75,000/µL . If low count attributable bone marrow infiltration hypersplenism due lymphoma , ANC must ≥750/µL platelet ≥50,000/µL . 9 . Calculated measured creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min ≤7 day study enrollment ( use CockcroftGault method ) . 10 . Adequate hepatic function ( ≤2.5 x upper limit normal [ ULN ] alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] , alkaline phosphatase total bilirubin within normal limit ) . 11 . Patients must ≥18 year age . 12 . Women childbearing potential must agree use medically acceptable method birth control ( e.g. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study 12 month last dose rituximab . Men must use acceptable method/form contraception duration treatment 3 month end treatment . 13 . Patients must able understand investigational nature study give write informed consent prior study entry . 1 . The patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia . 2 . The patient transform lymphoma . 3 . History , clinically apparent , central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma leptomeningeal lymphoma . 4 . The patient receive corticosteroid treatment lymphoma . Chronic , lowdose corticosteroid ( e.g. , prednisone ≤20 mg/day ) allow treatment us lymphoma complication lymphoma . 5 . Peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE v3.0 grade 2 , ≤14 day study enrollment . 6 . Myocardial infarction ≤6 month prior study enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormalities screen must document medically relevant . 7 . History solid organ transplantation , posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder . 8 . Patients known history hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Hepatitis B surface antigen must test . 9 . The patient know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . 10 . Active , clinically serious infection &gt; grade 2 . Patients may eligible upon resolution infection . 11 . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . Confirmation female patient childbearing potential pregnant must establish negative serum pregnancy test ≤7 day prior start treatment . 12 . Known hypersensitivity bendamustine , bortezomib , boron , mannitol , rituximab . 13 . Concomitant active malignancy require therapy . 14 . Diagnosis treatment another malignancy within 3 year enrollment , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy . 15 . Treatment investigational agent ≤14 day prior study enrollment . 16 . Any disease ( ) , psychiatric condition , metabolic dysfunction , finding physical examination clinical laboratory test result would cause reasonable suspicion disease condition , contraindicate use study drug , may increase risk associate study participation , may affect interpretation result , would make patient inappropriate study .</criteria>
