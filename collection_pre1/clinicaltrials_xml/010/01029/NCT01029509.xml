	<brief_title>Study Assess OPB-31121 Advanced Leukemias Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : In study perform animal , OPB-31121 show stop certain change proteins body . Stopping change may effect tumor cell . How OPB-31121 work fully know . Study Groups : The first 3 participant enrol study receive low level OPB-31121 . Each additional group 3 4 participant receive dose level dependent upon previous group respond study drug . You may 13 study `` cycle '' ( 273 day ) . During 28 day study cycle , receive study drug 21 day `` rest '' ( study drug ) 7 day . The cycle 28 day , 21 day drug , 7 day rest . Study Drug Administration : The study drug pill take time day . You drink 8 ounce ( 1 cup ) room temperature , non-carbonated water take study drug . You eat snack meal within 30 minute take study drug . You remain sit upright stand least 30 minute take drug . Study Visits AML , ALL , MDS participant : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Urine collect routine test . - Women able child urine pregnancy test . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon total ) drawn 10 time . These blood draw routine test , heart , thyroid testing , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) testing , genotyping . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Genotyping test test look piece DNA call gene . These test look specific gene may predict body may break certain type drug . A small needle call `` heparin lock '' may insert vein make multiple blood draw easy . On Day 2 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw heart , PK , biomarker test . On Days 8 , 15 21 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine , heart , thyroid testing . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon total ) also draw PK test . Blood drawn total 10 time , last blood draw 10 hour receive study drug . - Blood ( 1/2 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker test ( Day 21 ) . On Day 22 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn 2 time PK test . On Day 23 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) draw 1 time PK test . On Day 28 Cycle 1 , follow procedure perform : - You ECG . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You bone marrow aspiration sample take check status disease . This sample take take study drug end odd cycle . On Day 1 Cycles 2-13 , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1-1/2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine , heart , thyroid test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Women able child urine pregnancy test . - On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 , blood ( le 1 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker test . - You MUGA scan . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy . Study Visits CLL CML participant : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 8 tablespoon total ) also draw total 10 time routine , heart , thyroid , biomarker , genotyping , PK test . The last blood draw 24 hour receive study drug ( Day 2 ) . A small needle call `` heparin lock '' may insert vein make multiple blood draw easy . - Women able child urine pregnancy test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy . On Day 2 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw 24 hour study drug dose heart PK testing . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw routine PK testing . On Days 21 Cycle 1 , ECG . Blood ( 8 tablespoon total ) drawn 8 time PK , routine , heart , thyroid , biomarker test . On Days 22 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn 2 time PK test . On Day 23 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) draw 1 time PK testing . During Cycles 2-13 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn every 2 week routine , heart , thyroid test . On Day 1 Cycles 2-13 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG MUGA scan . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine , heart , thyroid , biomarker test . - Women able child urine pregnancy test . - During Cycles 2-3 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker test . End-of-Study Visit : Once study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw routine , heart , thyroid , PK test . - Urine collect routine test . - If AML , ALL MDS , blood ( 1-1/2 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . Follow Up : Your doctor study staff call 30 day final visit see feeling . The phone call take 5-10 minute . This investigational study . OPB-31121 FDA approve commercially available . At time , OPB-31121 use research . Up 48 patient take part multi-center study .</detailed_description>
