	<brief_title>Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , approximately 180,000 new case breast cancer occur annually , 40,000 death . More 150,000 case develop year Canada European community together , result 60,000 death breast cancer . The vast majority patient die breast cancer succumb metastatic disease . Endocrine therapy chemotherapy ( use either sequential single agent combination regimen ) remain principal treatment woman metastatic breast cancer . A wide variety class chemotherapeutic agent activity single agent . Median survival remain approximately two year woman metastatic breast cancer , le 3 % patient experience long-term survival treatment . The development new treatment strategy therefore essential improve outcome patient metastatic breast cancer . The population select study previously receive , appropriate , drug clearly define survival advantage ( anthracyclines , taxanes , trastuzumab , hormonal therapy ) . Patients metastatic non-small cell lung cancer consider incurable . Palliative chemotherapy , platinum-based doublet , Taxotere Pemetrexed Erlotinib ( epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase ) proven improve symptom , survival patient good performance status . Despite treatment , median survival metastatic non-small cell lung cancer one year . Therefore , urgent need develop novel therapy patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm metastatic breast cancer Stage IIIb IV nonsmall cell lung cancer . Must measurable disease define least one target lesion RECIST criterion irradiate . Progressive disease prior chemotherapy patient refusal chemotherapy option . Breast Cancer Patients receive two prior line chemotherapy . This include prior anthracycline taxane therapy , either adjuvant metastatic setting . HER2 positive breast cancer receive Trastuzumab , either adjuvant metastatic setting . Estrogen Receptor positive breast cancer receive least one prior hormonal therapy , either adjuvant metastatic setting . Nonsmall cell lung cancer patient receive least platinum base chemotherapy adjuvant , neoadjuvant metastatic setting . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X ULN &lt; 5 X ULN presence live metastasis . Creatinine &lt; 1.5 X ULN Recovery baseline , , grade 1 drugrelated toxicity due prior chemotherapy , radiation , hormonal therapy , molecular target therapy , except alopecia . Ejection fraction MUGA scan echocardiogram must within normal range . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test woman men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry , duration study participation 30 day last dose study therapy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , molecular target therapy , radiotherapy within 4 week prior receive first dose DCA . An exception make palliative radiation bone must complete 10 day prior first dose DCA . An exception also make HER2 positive BC continue receive Trastuzumab therapy DCA . Patients recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , molecular target agent . Active CNS metastasis . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition DCA . Due possibility peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy DCA , presence grad peripheral neuropathy due prior medical condition ( multiple sclerosis ) , medication , etiology . Any psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition permit medical followup compliance study protocol . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( require parenteral antibiotic ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction DCA . 2 year must elapse since initial curative procedure malignancy , except situ cervical cancer , nonmelanoma skin cancer , localize prostate cancer curative therapy surgery , radiation . Patient history inflammatory bowel disease , malabsorption syndrome , condition cause chronic diarrhea require active therapy substantial amount small bowel stomach remove may impair absorption DCA . Therapeutic anticoagulation allow Heparin LMWH Coumadin . Any history nephrolithiasis possible increase urinary oxalate DCA correlation nephrolithiasis .</criteria>
