The way find certain compare child give antibiotic heparin coat catheter give standard one clinical trial . Because know type catheter best , type catheter child receives study decide randomly chance . Each child trial chance get three catheter : - Standard central venous catheter ( coat ) . - Heparin coated central venous catheter . Heparin medicine stop blood clotting might stop tube blocked infection blood . - Antibiotic coated central venous catheter . Antibiotics use kill bacteria cause infection . The aim study see three type catheter compare reduce amount blood infection child . We also look cost involve . We hope recruit 1200 child UK 2 year . We hope information get study guide policy purchasing impregnated Central Venous Catheters across NHS thereby improve treatment child future .</brief_summary>
