	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial Intubation , Comparing Pentax AWS Against Macintosh Laryngoscope .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General anaesthesia often require trachea protected intubation . This involve placement cuffed endotracheal tube trachea , onset unconsciousness muscle relaxation . Usually require anaesthetist obtain direct view patient 's vocal cord via mouth , use laryngoscope Macintosh laryngoscope . The endotracheal tube guide vocal cord trachea . Difficult fail intubation , potentially serious occasionally life threaten complication . This unexpected inability place endotracheal tube correct place . The common cause failure achieve adequate view vocal cord laryngoscopy . Failed difficult intubation significantly delay establishment secure airway therefore lead major morbidity hypoxia and/or aspiration gastric content . Other morbidity also ensue delay procedure emergency situation airway trauma due various device use force required secure intubation . Whilst anaesthetists assistant trained deal difficult fail intubation , disaster occur . For example , obstetrics , previous Confidential Enquiry Maternal Deaths report five six death directly due anaesthesia related intubation difficulty . The Pentax Airway Scope AWS-S100 ( Pentax AWS ) , Rigid Video Laryngoscope Intubation new self-contained video laryngoscope integral colour-viewing screen mount handle . A camera tip transmits indirect image , obviates need obtain direct view vocal cord . It require prior set-up equipment intuitive use anyone already competent traditional direct laryngoscopy . Previously conduct evaluation scope present show intubation secure within clinically normal time span various grade anaesthetists various clinical situation . Authors currently suggest role back-up device difficult intubation train . One obtain Foresterhill site purpose . RATIONALE The simplicity use intuitive function Pentax AWS suggest may wider role back-up could possibly first-line laryngoscope situation difficulty intubation likely hazardous . The incidence difficult fail intubation individual anaesthetist related experience , decrease experience increase . The purpose trial evaluate Pentax AWS use relatively inexperienced anaesthetist . Inexperienced anaesthetists likely encounter difficulty thus practice carry high risk . Therefore , set would particular benefit patient safety effective tool successful timely completion tracheal intubation . METHODS The study compare intubation use Pentax AWS vs. usual Macintosh laryngoscope sample patient 1st 2nd year specialist trainee anaesthesia ( ST 's ) perform intubation . There change routine practice purpose trial . Specifically , trial recruit population patient ST 's routinely schedule intubate anyway . They work direct supervision consultant senior specialist registrar ( SpR ) , time . Initially , data relate routine intubation Macintosh laryngoscope collect . We conduct train method use Pentax AWS ST 's , pre-determined level ( see ) collect compare learn data , routine clinical work laryngoscope . Following , determine effectiveness Pentax AWS patient undergo routine tracheal intubation . 4 ST 's perform intubation within trial . They fulfil experience criterion require study , begin anaesthetic training August 2010 August 2011 , reach require Royal College Anaesthetists ' level competency practice intubation approve anaesthetise indirect supervision . Prior commencement recruitment study , necessary ST anaesthetist demonstrate safe level ability Pentax AWS . This order compromise safety patient randomize undergo intubation Pentax AWS . They train use Pentax AWS principle investigator ( PI ) , initially use airway train manikin normal clinical practice . After gain basic skill Pentax AWS , intubation scope time . Supervised training Pentax AWS continue ST anaesthetist able intubate clinically safe timeframe ST anaesthetist require perform successfully without trainer input ten consecutive procedure . Once assessed competent Pentax AWS PI eligible intubate patient enter trial .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adults ( 18 year ) schedule elective surgery whose anaesthetic plan would normally include oral intubation use Macintosh laryngoscope blade junior anaesthetist give valid informed consent . Patients require special technique intubation awake fibreoptic intubation . Unconscious critically ill patient . Emergency situation . Vulnerable patient include patient : learning difficulty , terminal illness , mental illness , dementia , prisoner could consider particularly dependent relationship investigator ( medical student ) .</criteria>
