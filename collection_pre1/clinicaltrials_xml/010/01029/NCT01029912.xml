	<brief_summary>Ankle dorsiflexor weakness ( paresis ) one frequently persist consequence stroke . The purpose exploratory study compare two different treatment -- Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( CCNMES ) Cyclic Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( cNMES ) -- improved recovery ankle movement well walk stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation Recovery Ankle Dorsiflexion Chronic Stroke Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankle dorsiflexor weakness result inefficient unstable gait . While routine physical therapy beneficial , many individual remains limited effectiveness , consequently many stroke survivor difficulty walk safely remain non-ambulatory . Ankle-foot-orthoses ( AFOs ) often prescribe provide ankle stability , limit ankle mobility may actually inhibit recovery dorsiflexion . Advanced rehabilitation technique emphasize active , repetitive , goal-oriented movement impair limb produce measurable functional improvement , yet significant degree low extremity disability often remain . In addition , emerge therapy difficult administer applicable patient retain least degree ambulation . Thus , need alternative treatment . This exploratory study innovative neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) treatment restore low extremity motor control follow stroke . We investigate whether stroke survivor chronic footdrop recover voluntary ankle dorsiflexion novel treatment NMES . Surface electrodes deliver stimulation dorsiflex ankle intensity proportional amount dorsiflexion unimpaired ankle . Thus , voluntary dorsiflexion unaffected ankle produce stimulate dorsiflexion affect ankle . We refer stimulation paradigm Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( CCNMES ) . In contrast exist peroneal nerve stimulators , CCNMES intend use assist ambulation ; rather intend solely motor retrain paradigm may reduce low extremity impairment improve ambulation . The primary objective propose study obtain pilot data estimate make efficacy CCNMES reduce low extremity impairment improve ambulation . Twenty-six chronic stroke survivor ( &gt; 6 month post-stroke ) randomize either CCNMES cyclic NMES , intervention provide electrical stimulation ankle dorsiflexors , preprogrammed timing intensity . For group , treatment last 6 week follow 3-month follow-up period . Assessments ankle impairment ambulation make baseline , post-treatment , 1-month 3-months post-treatment . This study first randomize control trial CCNMES restore ankle dorsiflexion patient chronic hemiplegia .</detailed_description>
