	<brief_title>Comparison Intravenous Cefazolin Plus Oral Probenecid With Oral Cephalexin Treatment Cellulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skin soft tissue infection ( SSTIs ) common reason presentation Emergency Department ( ED ) Canada . Although many patient mild SSTI able manage home oral antibiotic , mild-moderate infection often treat parenteral antibiotic . Current practice pattern Canadian EDs indicate patient population often treat intravenous cefazolin daily along oral probenecid return ED ambulatory set daily medication administration assessment . This parenteral regimen find result success rate comparable study evaluate treatment success oral antibiotic patient population ( 89-97 % ) . Although successful outcome achieve approach , often inconvenient patient return ED/ambulatory care unit daily contribute overall ED/ambulatory care visit volumes overall health care cost . Unfortunately , never study evaluate relative efficacy safety oral antibiotic aforementioned parenteral approach patient population thus remain significant knowledge gap must address change current practice explore . The objective study determine whether oral cephalexin equivalent intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid treatment uncomplicated SSTIs patient present ED . This study prospective , multi-centered , randomize control non-inferiority trial compare cephalexin 500 mg orally four time cefazolin 2 g IV plus probenecid 1 g orally , patient present ED presumed diagnosis SSTI . The primary outcome compare proportion patient fail therapy cellulitis 72 hour antibiotic treatment oral cephalexin IV cefazolin/oral probenecid 1 g daily . Secondary outcome include clinical cure rate 7 day , percentage patient require hospital admission , percentage patient step oral antibiotic day 7 therapy , percentage patient require additional antibiotic prescription day 7 , frequency adverse event .</detailed_description>
