	<brief_summary>This Pilot/Phase I , single arm , single center , open label study determine safety , efficacy cellular kinetics CART19 ( CTL019 ) chemotherapy resistant refractory CD19+ leukemia lymphoma subject . The study consist three Phases : 1 ) Screening Phase , follow 2 ) Intervention/Treatment Phase consist apheresis , lymphodepleting chemotherapy ( determine Investigator base subject 's disease burden histology , well prior chemotherapy history receive ) , infusion CTL019 , tumor collection bone marrow aspiration lymph node biopsy ( optional , depend availability ) , 3 ) Follow-up Phase . The suitability subject ' T cell CTL019 manufacturing determine study entry . Subjects adequate T cell leukapheresed obtain large number peripheral blood mononuclear cell CTL019 manufacturing . The T cell purify peripheral blood mononuclear cell , transduce TCR-Î¶/4-1BB lentiviral vector , expand vitro frozen future administration . The number subject inadequate T cell collection , expansion manufacturing compare number subject T cell successfully manufacture primary measure feasibility study . Unless contraindicate medically advisable base previous chemotherapy , subject give condition chemotherapy prior CTL019 infusion . The chemotherapy complete 1 4 day plan infusion first dose CTL019 . Up 20 evaluable subject CD19+ leukemia lymphoma plan dosed CTL019 . A single dose CTL019 ( consist approximately 5x10^9 total cell , minimal acceptable dose infusion 1.5x10^7 CTL019 cell ) give subject fraction ( 10 % , 30 % 60 % total dose ) Day 0 , 1 2 . A second 100 % dose CTL019 initially permit give Day 11 14 subject , provide adequate tolerance first dose sufficient CTL019 manufacture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : 1 . To evaluate safety feasibility single target dose 5 time 10e9 total cell , acceptable range 1.5 time 10e7 5 time 10e9 total cell comprise autologous CART-19 cell express TCR zeta 4-1 BB costimulatory domain . Secondary objective : 1 . Proof mechanism : determine 2nd generation CAR express 4-1BB costimulation domain improve persistence patient . 2 . Proof concept : determine effect CART-19 CD19 expression vivo . 3 . Proof bioactivity : Evaluate change systemic soluble immune factor patient 4 . Proof bioactivity : Evaluate impact CART19 treatment tumor burden 5 . Explore whether CART-19 cell retain anti-tumor activity vivo . 6 . Determine host immunity develop CART-19 . 7 . Characterize relative subset CART-19 T cell ( Tcm , Tem , Treg ) . 8 . Describe survival response rate</detailed_description>
