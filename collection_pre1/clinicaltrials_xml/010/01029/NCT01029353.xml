	<brief_summary>This trial compare effectiveness two surgical procedure -laparotomy versus drainage - commonly use treat necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) isolate intestinal perforation ( IP ) extremely low birth weight infant ( ≤1,000 g ) . Infants diagnose NEC IP require surgical intervention , recruit . Subjects randomize receive either laparotomy peritoneal drainage . Primary outcome impairment-free survival 18-22 month correct age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparotomy vs. Drainage Infants With Necrotizing Enterocolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) condition , generally affect premature infant , intestine become ischemic ( lack oxygen and/or blood flow ) . NEC occur 5-15 % extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infant . Isolated focal intestinal perforation ( IP ) less common condition , affect estimate 4 % ELBWs , hole develop intestine leak fluid abdominal cavity . Outcome infant NEC and/or IP poor : 49 % die half survive infant neurodevelopmentally impaired . Surgical option NEC IP include two possible procedure : peritoneal drainage , tube place abdominal cavity small incision fluid drain ; laparotomy , incision make abdomen necrotic intestine remove . Drainage may follow laparotomy . The Neonatal Research Network 's observational study 156 ELBW infant NEC IP ( Pediatrics . 2006 Apr ; 117 ( 4 ) : e680-7 ) show comparable outcome two procedure hospital discharge , suggest advantage laparotomy drainage 18-22 month correct age lower rate death neurodevelopmental impairment . However , infant underwent laparotomy mature ; infant drain small premature . We hypothesize initial laparotomy may improve infant 's long-term neurodevelopmental outcome , potentially reduce maximum severity duration inflammation . This study randomize control trial compare effectiveness laparotomy versus drainage treat NEC IP extremely low birth weight infant . Target enrollment 300 infant diagnose NEC IP randomization receive initially either laparotomy drainage . Subsequent laparotomy may perform infant either group , condition continue deteriorate . Surviving infant return follow-up assessment 18-22 month correct age . This trial use comprehensive cohort design add conventional randomized trial design , secondary specific aim . In addition collect detailed information randomize infant , also collect information non-randomized infant NEC/IP officially enrol preference cohort .</detailed_description>
