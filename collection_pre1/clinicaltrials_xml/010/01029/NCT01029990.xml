	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Study Interventions Increase Participation Cervical Cancer Screening Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Cervical cancer today consider disease large extent preventable . In Sweden cytological screening ongoing since 60 : make cervical cancer rare disease . Several new , costly , method like HPV-testing vaccination claim reduce cancer incidence , scientifically proven far . A recent audit Swedish screen program ( Andrae 2008 ) find foremost risk factor cervical cancer context program non participation . Women participate well protected cervical cancer . A Swedish study evaluate different strategy increase participation find telephone contact defaulter superior intervention ( Eaker 2004 ) . This study do region Sweden low coverage ( Sparén 2007 ) less emphasis effort increase participation . A study Kalmar , Sweden , high coverage find extended yield request non-participating woman cost effective ( Oscarsson 2007 ) . Self test HPV advocate effective method kit commercially available ( Stenvall 2007 ) . The procedure use routine Uppsala county market county . Aim To study two possible intervention increase participation Design Randomised control trial two intervention control arm Hypothesis Intervention ) supportive telephone contact , midwife , woman smear register two screen round increase participation , increase uptake precancerous lesion ( CIN2+ ) cost effective . b ) selftesting oncogenic papillomavirus ( HPV ) increase participation cost effective . Method : selection study base Selection do random among woman age 29 - 63 pap-smear register within two recent screen round . Women exclude invitation due total hysterectomy woman could identify immigrated region period exclude randomisation . July 1 2008 52362 woman fulfil first criterion ( exclusion ) identify Register Prevention Cervical Cancer West Sweden . 8800 selected woman include randomised one three arm distribution 5:1:5 Methods : Intervention Arm A : 4000 randomise woman fulfil inclusion criterion receive letter informing contact midwife phone , offer appointment take smear . They stage decline contact wish return contact information ( telephone number ) . A week later woman decline call midwife offer appointment take smear . Abnormal smear follow referral gynecologist concordance normal screen routine . Arm B : 800 woman send offer HPV-self sampling ( Aprovix , Uppsala , Sweden ) . By regular mail woman order test kit , return laboratory sampling . The sample test Hybrid Capture II high risk HPV . A negative result communicate woman . A positive result send gynecological clinic responsible work abnormal cytological screening smear area woman live . The afflicted woman get information clinic appointment colposcopy cytology . Further investigation conduct clinical routine . Reminders send woman order kit return sample . In order evaluate effect primary reminder woman respond primary offer within 60 day receive reminder . Arm C ( control ) 4000 woman control . No specific action take within study outside routine screen program ( yearly write reminder smear find database ) Methods : Data collection All data cytology , colposcopy biopsy treatment CIN register routine West Sweden Registry Cervical Cancer Prevention data extract registry . Data HPV-testing transfer registry Aprovix laboratory Uppsala . Man-time needed cost material analysis different intervention register base health economic assessment . Primary outcome : Frequency test ( cytology arm A C HPV-test arm B ) . Frequency assessment abnormal test ( arm ) . Secondary outcome : ( Arm A v arm C ) Frequency abnormal smear . Frequency treat CIN , ( CIN1 , CIN2 CIN3 , group low grade ( CIN1 ) high grade ( CIN2 , CIN3 , AIS invasive cancer ) . Number invasive cancer FIGO stadium . Cost intervention . Cost per CIN2+ find . The study power find 30 % difference primary outcome base expect 20 % participation rate control group 80 % power significance level 5 % intervention ( A B compare C ) . An expected rate abnormal smear 7 % among woman smear record 6 year give 80 % power find 60 % relative difference number abnormal smear ( RR=1,6 ) intervention arm A compare control arm C. The result work abnormal test arm A consider representative arm B well , give level abnormality . The cost per participant per biopsy CIN find calculate . The cost per find treat high grade CIN compare reference estimate €3500 ( preliminary figure ) per CIN2+ eradicate . Methods : Statistical analysis All analysis base intention treat . Pearson 's Chi2 Fischers exact test use compare distribution categorical variable group . One way variance use test difference mean group continuous variable . The cumulated probability outcome vs. follow time calculate Kaplan-Meier analysis . Multiple Cox regression use determine relative risk . 95 % confidence interval use throughout level significance calculate two side 5 %</detailed_description>
