	<detailed_description>Endovascular treatment intracranial aneurysm detachable coil widely use since introduction GDCs 1991 proven effective prevent rebleeding aneurysmal rupture . The clinical angiographic result endovascular coil occlusion intracranial aneurysm positive , initial final overall complete occlusion rate 35.9 % -76.8 % 38.3 % - 87.8 % . In mid- long-term , however , aneurysm recanalization may occur many one-third case . The natural history aneurysm recurrence coil treatment often benign , bleed incompletely coil aneurysms well-documented threat , moreover , degree aneurysm occlusion treatment strongly associate risk rerupture . Even 100 % occlusion aneurysm initial treatment obtain immediate postembolization angiography , still relatively high recanalization rate ( 26.4 % ) long-term follow-up angiography . In recent study , confirm still aneurysm perfusion aneurysm sac complete occlude aneurysm matter initial follow-up rotate digital angiography . In addition , author demonstrate endothelialization aneurysm orifice follow placement GDCs occur ; however , appear exception rather rule . To overcome disadvantage , Willis cover stent , specially design intracranial vasculature , develop institution MicroPort Medical Company ( Micro-Port , Shanghai , China ) . Our preliminary result demonstrate good flexibility efficacy Willis cover stent treatment cranial internal carotid artery aneurysm ( CICA ) patient without extremely tortuous ICA ( Radiology 2009 ; 253:470-7 ) , also cover stent proved effective re-coiling regard complete occlusion recurrent aneurysm ( J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2009 ; 16 : [ Epub ahead print ] ) . Since 2005 , perform nonrandomized prospective trial endovascular treatment CICA aneurysms cover stenting coil embolization . So , evaluate whether implantation primary Willis cover stent yield angiographic clinical result superior currently recommend approach coil embolization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Definite CICA aneurysm , either rupture unruptured , demonstrated arterial angiography ; 2 . Parent artery diameter 3.05.0 mm ; 3 . Good tolerance BOT ; 4 . At least one control angiogram take &gt; 6 month initial treatment 1 . An extremely tortuous vessel proximal parent artery and/or lack appropriate accessible route , thereby render patient unsuitable endovascular treatment ; 2 .
