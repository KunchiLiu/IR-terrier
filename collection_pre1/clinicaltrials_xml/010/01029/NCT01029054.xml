	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Lenalidomide With Dexamethasone Combination Newly Diagnosed , Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Phase I portion clinical trial , dose Revlimid® carfilzomib increase best safe amount ( dose ) identify combination standard dose Revlimid® dexamethasone . `` Investigational '' mean drug combination still study research doctor try find safe dose use , side effect may cause effective Revlimid® carfilzomib dexamethasone investigational combination treat newly diagnose multiple myeloma . In clinical trial look high dose combination give safely see well work combination newly diagnose patient . The drug , carfilzomib , yet approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) . Revlimid® Dexamethasone approve FDA . The drug approve combination use type cancer type cancer . Carfilzomib research treat multiple myeloma . Dexamethasone commonly use , either alone , combination drug , treat multiple myeloma . Revlimid® currently approve US FDA combination dexamethasone treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least 1 prior therapy . After Phase I clinical trial defines safest dos Revlimid® carfilzomib dexamethasone take together , research study move second portion , Phase II clinical trial . The Phase II portion clinical trial test clinical effectiveness best dose combination three drug .</detailed_description>
