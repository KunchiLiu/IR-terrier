	<brief_summary>Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome ( CAPS ) rare condition life-threatening blood clot form multiple organ simultaneously lead multi-organ system failure death . The cause CAPS entirely understand , CAPS episodes often trigger stressful event infection , surgery , trauma . For patient survive episode CAPS , permanent kidney failure uncommon kidney organ system frequently affect CAPS . Kidney transplantation treatment choice end-stage kidney disease , patient history CAPS exceptionally high-risk kidney transplant recipient chance surgery could trigger life-threatening transplant-threatening episode CAPS significant . As result , patient CAPS generally consider candidate transplantation . Despite , patient severely decrease life-expectancy dialysis long-term survival quality life would greatly increase successful kidney transplant . In trial , drug call eculizumab test ability prevent CAPS kidney transplantation patient prior history CAPS . Eculizumab inhibitor complement system , believe important generate inflammatory environment lead diffuse clot blood vessel CAPS . The investigator hypothesize block complement cascade use eculizumab , conjunction block coagulation system , kidney transplantation safely successfully perform patient history CAPS .</brief_summary>
