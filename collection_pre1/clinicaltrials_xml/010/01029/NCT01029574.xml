	<brief_summary>Repair rotator cuff high rate re-rupture ( 20-54 % ) , despite good clinical result . Several way improve heal tendon-bone currently study , among use use growth factor . The platelet-rich plasma source several growth factor , already use various orthopedic procedure . The aim study evaluate effectiveness platelet-rich plasma improve tendon-bone heal arthroscopic rotator cuff repair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff repair ( RCR ) procedure widely perform shoulder surgery , give high prevalence type injury population . Regardless approach employ , procedure consist rehabilitation rotator cuff bed . Despite clinical result highly satisfactory ( success rate around 85 % ) , study use ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) show rate re-rupture surgery 20 54 % . These level re-injury suggest sub-optimal heal bone-tendon interface . Attempts improve heal place RMR extensively study orthopedic literature . One use growth factor ( GF ) , cytokine play important role chemotaxis , cell proliferation differentiation , well synthesis extracellular matrix , theoretically could beneficial role tissue repair . The Platelet-Rich Plasma ( PRP ) one study source GF . It easy prepare non-immunogenic ( do patient 's blood ) , advantage presence several FC ( include PDGF , bFGF , TGF-B , VEGF , EGF , CTGF IGF ) . This fact important disease different effect different receiver various stage heal . The use PRP bone heal evaluate several study conflict result . There preclinical study demonstrate beneficial effect PRP tendon ligament repair . However , publish paper show effectiveness use PRP tendon-bone interface . The aim study evaluate effectiveness PRP enhance heal tendon-bone repair injury RC . Will operate patient complete injury ( full thickness ) rotator cuff , divide two group randomly . The use PRP decide seal envelope , 20 individual group . The subject assess pre postoperatively accord criterion Constant UCLA help MRI , unknown evaluator group patient belongs .</detailed_description>
