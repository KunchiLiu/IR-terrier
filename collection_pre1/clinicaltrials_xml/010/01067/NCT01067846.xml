	<brief_summary>For project , investigator interest explore new way extend maintain drug abstinence people addict crack cocaine . This study combine medication call D-Cycloserine ( DCS ) weekly cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) ass whether combination enhance people 's ability stay clean ( drug free ) long period time . One great risk drug relapse drug craving . Oftentimes drug craving occur person confront stressor reminder past drug use behavior . DCS show enhance learn new information . By administer DCS prior learn new technique cope drug crave drug-use reminder , possible patient successful living drug free life longer period time . In addition explore model behaviorally , investigator explore change may occur brain therapy/medication intervention . A technique call MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) use identify area brain activate attention task . Areas neural activation assess study entry , end therapy ( 4-week endpoint ) one month follow completion treatment program .</brief_summary>
