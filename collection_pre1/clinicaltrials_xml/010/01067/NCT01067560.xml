	<brief_summary>This study determine level glucose ( sugar ) CSF ( fluid surround spinal cord ) 30 subject spinal anesthesia cesarean section use bedside glucose meter . Spinal anesthesia do inject drug needle CSF . Subjects 1/10 tsp CSF remove time spinal anesthesia measure level glucose . Glucose meter measure glucose , usually blood , use operating room . This study see whether glucose meter easily measure level glucose CSF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) Glucose Levels Patients Under Going Elective Cesarean Section With Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description Spinal anesthesia consist put drug cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , fluid surround spinal cord . This allow subject awake `` numb '' chest operation . Spinal anesthesia do insert small needle ( spinal needle ) subject 's back space ( subarachnoid space ) contain CSF . Once spinal needle subarachnoid space small amount fluid ( CSF ) see come spinal needle , confirm needle right space . The anesthesiologist injects local anesthetic CSF freeze numb area surgery pain medication , morphine , relieve pain operation . CSF contain glucose ( sugar ) presence glucose fluid come spinal needle confirm fluid CSF . If spinal anesthesia use cesarean section follow fail epidural anesthesia ( may happen woman epidural labor pain relief need cesarean section ) may difficult tell whether fluid come spinal needle CSF local anesthetic use epidural . In word , needle may epidural space instead subarachnoid space spinal anesthetic would work . A simple bedside test confirm fluid CSF could potentially prevent situation . Local anesthetic contain glucose test fluid glucose could help determine needle proper space spinal anesthesia . The study determine normal level CSF glucose use three different glucose meter ( Nova Stat Strip , Abbott Precision Xtra Roche Accucheck Inform 2 bedside device measure glucose ) . A glucose meter use people diabetes check blood sugar level use drop blood . The result study hopefully provide basis study would look whether possible distinguish CSF epidural fluid spinal anesthesia do follow failed epidural anesthetic . This could help prevent failure spinal anesthesia situation . This prospective , observational study . The Cesarean Section spinal anesthesia continue per usual practice BCWH . Consenting subject receive drug aspect anesthetic care except two difference . The first , anesthesiologist collect small amount CSF ( 0.5 mL 1/10 teaspoon ) measure amount glucose . This test do operating room three glucose meter ( Nova Stat Strip , Abbott Precision Xtra Roche Accucheck Inform 2 ) laboratory ( use one two machine : 1 ) Vitros 9 2 ) Vitros 5,1 FS ) . Secondly , blood sugar level test take three drop blood pinprick subject 's toe compare CSF glucose level .</detailed_description>

Age 19 year old Understand write oral English Women emergency Cesarean section Women epidural , combine spinal epidural general anesthesia Women contraindication spinal anesthesia Women le 19 year age Women abnormality glucose metabolism diabetes mellitus , gestational diabetes Women receive dextrose intravenously prior surgery Women technical problem anticipate insertion spinal ( scoliosis ) ot may hematological abnormality If technical difficulty insertion spinal increase chance trauma , result blood enter CSF ( bloody tap ) . This could potentially source glucose . Women hematological abnormality increase bleeding may increase chance blood CSF .</criteria>
