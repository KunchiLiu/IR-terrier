	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Studies evaluate response bronchodilation flow-volume spirometry and/or force oscillation technique ( FOT ) , conduced subject ( child adult ) obstructive airways disease . Less known bronchodilation response , assess spirometry FOT healthy young subject . PURPOSE The purpose present study 1. determine range bronchodilation response term change PEF , FEV1 , FEF25 , FEF50 , FEF75 , FEF25-75 , healthy non-smoking young adult , identify normal response inhale bronchodilatory agent versus placebo , anthropometric spirometric determinant 2. determine range characteristic bronchodilation response use pseudorandom FOT healthy non-smoking young adult , identify normal response inhale bronchodilatory agent versus placebo , anthropometric oscillometric determinant . 3. compare correlate eventual change spirometric oscillometric parameter . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study conduce Laboratory Respiratory Functions University Hospital Patras , Patras , Greece . Healthy , non-smoking young adult ( medical student resident ) voluntary include . Participants assess eligibility structure interview include question regard respiratory symptom ( wheeze , attack shortness breath , sputum production , dyspnea rest exertion ) , diagnose respiratory disease , use pulmonary medication . A subject consider non-smoker he/she never smoke discontinue smoke least 5 year prior enter study . Anthropometric data obtain enrollment . All oscillometric spirometric measurement perform morning hour ( 09:00 12:00 ) . Subjects advise refrain consume coffee tea , engage heavy eat 2 hour . Respiratory impedance spectrum ( Zrs ) , yield resistance ( Rrs ) reactance ( Xrs ) function frequency , obtain use commercially available device ( i2m , Chess Medical , Belgium ) , accordance ERS 2003 guideline . The forced oscillatory signal pseudorandom signal consist frequency component 4 48 Hz measurement period 8 sec . During measurement subject seat comfortably upright neck neutral position arm rest comfortably side . The cheek low jaw subject firmly supported staff member measurement . Participants connect device via mouthpiece incorporate bacterial filter instruct breathe normally nose clip place . Five technically acceptable measurement obtain . A measurement consider unacceptable coherence &lt; 0.95 2 frequency Zrs show obvious artifact . The calibration device check daily know resistance . All measurement perform trained respiratory physician . Spirometric measurement always follow FOT measurement . Spirometry complete flow-volume device ( MasterScreen IOS , Viasys/Jaeger ; Höchberg , Germany ) , subject seat , use ATS 1994 criterion perform maneuver . Nose clip disposable bacterial filter use . At least three technically acceptable measurement record maximum eight effort . All measurement perform trained respiratory physician . The calibration device check daily 3-L calibration syringe ( Viasys/Jaeger ; Höchberg , Germany ) . The subject inhale 0.4mg salbutamol ( Aerolin , GlaxoSmithCline , London , UK ) spacer device ( Volumatic , GlaxoSmithCline ) , placebo inhaler ( Allen &amp; Hanburys LTD , Greenford , UK ) similar spacer . Special measure take ensure blindness participant regard receive inhaler . Respiratory function measurement ( FOT follow spirometry ) repeat ( describe ) 15 min inhalation . Subjects remain seat without consume beverage water . Each subject two session baseline post-inhalation measurement ; one receiving salbutamol one placebo . These session perform one day apart . The respiratory physician perform measurement unaware regard receive inhaler . All technically acceptable Zrs measurement average mean Rrs Xrs 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 44 , 46 , 48 Hz calculate . The resonance frequency , average Rrs 4-24 Hz ( Rrs 4-24 ) 4-48 Hz ( Rrs 4-48 ) , frequency dependence Rrs 4-24 Rrs 4-48 also assess . Absolute relative change bronchodilation placebo examine . Spirometric variable use analysis include PEF , FEV1 , FEF25 , FEF50 , FEF75 , FEF25-75 . Absolute relative change bronchodilation placebo examine . Multiple linear regression analysis perform determine individual effect follow factor absolute relative bronchodilatory response : age , sex , height , weight , BMI , baseline lung function . The Pearson correlation use assess association oscillometric spirometric variable . All analysis perform use SPSS 17 window ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
