	<brief_title>Reversal Obese/Diabetic Cardiomyopathy After Gastric Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes major risk factor heart failure . Moreover , patient diabetes heart failure bad survival without diabetes . We know patient diabetes alter heart metabolism , structure , function . It unclear alteration ameliorate weight loss . We would like learn whether cardiac metabolism , structure , function diabetic patient heart failure symptom improve marked weight loss gastric bypass surgery . Study Day 1 . Screening . We screen subject know diabetes high likelihood diabetes undergo gastric bypass surgery . We approach patient Bariatric Surgery clinic regard enrollment study . If agree participate , answer simple questionnaire : medical history , obesity information , MRI/MRS exclusion ( see Appendices ) . We obtain permission review medical chart . Study Day 2 . Screening include physical examination phlebotomy complete blood count , oral glucose tolerance test , &amp; comprehensive metabolic profile screen rest stress echocardiogram . The rest stress echocardiogram use exclude cardiac abnormality diastolic dysfunction . Optisonâ„¢ Definity use need echocardiograms . We determine subject ' fat fat-free mass use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) image Center Applied Research Sciences unit . Study Day 3 . Baseline Imaging Studies . Subject preparation . We expect 30 subject complete study 's screening test meet study criterion . The evening image Study Days 3 &amp; 4 , subject admit The Center Applied Research Sciences Intensive Research Unit order standardize metabolic milieu myocardial fat image study . At 1800 , subject ingest standard meal contain total ~700 kcal subject . Carbohydrate , fat , protein represent 55 , 30 , 15 % , respectively , total energy intake . At 2000 , subject ingest define liquid formula snack contain 250 kcal , 40 g carbohydrate , 6.1 g fat , 8.8 g protein ( Ensure , Ross Laboratories , Columbus , OH ) . After snack , subject fast completion study follow day . Subjects give lunch complete image study . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Subjects place gantry scanner . Examinations perform 1.5T scanner use ECG gating , breath-hold , chest array coil This scanner use 1H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . The MRS protocol base free-breathing , point-resolved spectroscopy ( PRESS ) sequence ECG two-dimensional respiratory gate optimize accuracy robustness . Subject care . All subject give lunch , prepared Intensive Research Unit image complete . All image complete 12PM . If physician monitoring subject determines subject would benefit furosemide 20mg , p.o . x 1 , KCl , p.o . - 10 day course may provide ( follow-up K+ check ) . Patients ' physician would notify change . We request subject stay medical regimen throughout test period . We recognize may possible subject . Gastric bypass . Subjects undergo surgery Study Day 3 . The surgeon ( J.C.E . ) perform bypass procedure use standard technique . Briefly , small ( ~20 mL ) proximal gastric pouch create stapling across stomach , 150 cm Roux-Y limb construct transect jejunum 30cm distal ligament Treitz create jejunojejunostomy 150 cm distal transection . Study Day 4 . Imaging Studies - 3 month surgery . Subjects undergo image study condition order Study Day 3 except subject Day 4 also undergo rest echocardiogram diastolic function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject type 2 diabetes risk type 2 diabetes BMI &gt; 30kg/m2 . Subjects must age 35 70 year , order limit confound affect age endpoint . 23 Subjects must also meet follow definition diastolic dysfunction : 1 ) meet Framingham criterion heart failure ( see Appendix ) , 2 ) ejection fraction &gt; 45 % base rest portion screen echocardiography , 24 To determine potential subject meet criterion , 1 ) interview , 2 ) clinical chart review , research study coordinator and/or PI , 3 ) undergo history physical PI ( Study Day 2 ) undergo screen study . Subjects &lt; 35 &gt; 70 year , current smoker , obese , unstable , able lie flat imaging study , ambulatory , unable give inform consent , pregnant , lactate exclude . Those condition may masquerade diastolic heart failure ( e.g . constrictive pericarditis ) exclude base screen echocardiogram ; atrial flutter fibrillation , evidence major systemic disease ( e.g. , cancer ) , ejection fraction &lt; 45 % , &gt; class I hypertension take 1 medication ( diuretic ) hypertension exclude . We exclude patient sleep apnea data suggest affect leave ventricular ( LV ) diastolic function , ask questionnaire well phenotyping subjects.25 We exclude patient significant pulmonary hypertension ( peak artery pressure &gt; 55mmHg ) , since patient diastolic dysfunction pressure lower , pressure great may indicate cardiopulmonary pathology .</criteria>
