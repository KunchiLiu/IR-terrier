	<brief_title>Continuous Hemodialysis With Enhanced Middle Molecule Clearance Membrane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In sepsis , removal middle molecular weight molecule cytokine ( also call blood purification ) , show great interest intensive care last decade . Indeed , cytokine involve development multi-organ failure syndrome patient septic shock . There evidence suggest extracorporeal therapy ( hemofiltration-hemodialysis ) interesting tool modulate inflammatory response restore immune homeostasis . However , hemodialysis use `` conventional '' membrane allow removal middle molecule . Conversely , high-volume hemofiltration appropriate therapy lot drawback due high ultrafiltration rate ( removal beneficial small molecule , technical economical issue due use large amount fluid replacement ) . Finally , high cut-off hemofiltration report associated significant albumin loss . Therefore , continuous `` enhance middle molecule clearance '' hemodialysis could interest alternative , make possible removal middle molecule without significant albumin loss theoretical advantage ( reduce cost due possibility produce dialysate water circuit , decrease nursing workload ) . The aim study assess clearance different kind molecule ( small , middle large ) continuous enhance middle molecule clearance hemodialysis apply septic patient .</detailed_description>
