	<brief_title>Comprehensive Cardiothoracic Dual Source CT Early Triage Patients With Acute Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Undifferentiated chest pain one common complaint acute care set , account five million emergency department ( ED ) visit U.S. year . Moreover , early accurate triage patient remain difficult neither chest pain history , single set biochemical marker myocardial necrosis , initial 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , alone combination , identify group patient safely discharge without diagnostic testing . As result , patient present ED undifferentiated chest pain often evaluate multiple examination exclude presence myocardial infarction ( MI ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , and/or aortic dissection ( AD ) . While contrast-enhanced spiral compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) become standard procedure evaluation presence PE AD , within past year noninvasive detection coronary artery stenosis CTA become feasible . Coronary CTA proven effective tool rule CAD report sensitivity 93-99 % specificity 95-97 % compare invasive coronary angiography . Recent data Rule Out Myocardial Infarction Computer Assisted Tomography ( ROMICAT ) study indicate coronary CTA accurately rule acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient acute chest pain therefore may enhance diagnostic work chest pain patient ED . Moreover , study demonstrate distribution several CT-angiographic pattern CAD may change management subject inconclusive initial ED evaluation admit hospital . For example , CTA demonstrate absence CAD 50 % patient . None subject without CAD CTA develop unstable angina MI index hospitalization . Furthermore , none patient MACE next six month , confirm previous observation ACS patient . These data suggest 50 % hospital admission could save . Another recent study group demonstrate individually tailor ECG-gated CT protocol single contrast injection permit simultaneous visualization coronary artery , thoracic aorta , pulmonary artery excellent image quality . The recent introduction dual source CT ( DSCT ) technology offer two-fold improvement temporal resolution compare standard 64-slice CTA use study ( 83ms vs. 165ms , respectively ) . This significant improvement temporal resolution allow acquisition diagnostic image high irregular heart rate , preclude need intravenous beta blockade . Given improved temporal resolution faster acquisition time , amount radiation exposure markedly reduce many patient . With need improve triage patient undifferentiated chest pain advantage offer DSCT technology , several observational case series suggest feasibility comprehensive thoracic DSCT ( CT-DSCT ) simultaneously evaluate coronary artery , thoracic aorta , pulmonary artery . Whether result improvement patient management test utilization remain unclear compare standard ED evaluation protocol need evaluate . Thus , purpose research determine efficiency single CT-DSCT protocol establish exclude MI , PE , AD compare individual protocol . Endpoints aim compare rate ED discharge , length hospital stay , diagnostic image test utilization , cost comprehensive standard protocol strategy patient undifferentiated chest discomfort shortness breath component chest discomfort .</detailed_description>
