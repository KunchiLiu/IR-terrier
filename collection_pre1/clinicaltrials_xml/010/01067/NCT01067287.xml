	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety CT-011 alone , well combination Dendritic cell fusion vaccine CT-011 , autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . We also try find effect combination disease , include successful prevent delay disease come back , compare treatment autologous transplantation alone . ASCT standard therapy multiple myeloma often successful significantly decrease amount cancer body . CT-011 investigational monoclonal antibody . Monoclonal antibody type drug give infusion vein know target specific cell ( case , cell immune system ) . The dendritic cell fusion vaccine investigational agent try help immune system recognize fight cancer cell . Unlike standard vaccine use prevent infection , cancer vaccine study see fight cancer already body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- There two group study : Group 1 : All participant study group receive infusion CT-011 start one three month follow autologous transplant . Participants group receive total 3 dos CT-011 6 week interval . Group 2 : All participant group receive infusion CT-011 start one three month follow autologous transplant . Participants group receive total 3 dos CT-011 6 week interval . In addition , receive vaccination Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine one week follow infusion CT-011 . - All participant ( Group 1 Group 2 ) receive follow procedure : 1 ) Initial therapy multiple myeloma : All participant receive standard therapy reduce number multiple myeloma cell body . 2 ) Prior stem cell mobilization participant undergo physical exam , medical history , blood test measure blood count , liver kidney function , multiple myeloma protein level , research test measure immune response multiple myeloma cell . A small amount bone marrow remove participant hip . Participants also undergo skin test call `` delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) . 3 ) Prior autologous stem cell transplant , harvest stem cell participant blood store future transplant process call leukapheresis . 4 ) Within week successful stem cell collection , participant admit hospital high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . 5 ) Approximately 1-3 month follow ASCT , participant undergo additional test assess eligibility proceed treatment CT-011 alone ( group 1 ) combination CT-011 vaccination ( group 2 ) . - If post-transplant eligibility result meet study requirement participant receive 3 infusion CT-011 6 week interval . Prior infusion CT-011 , participant undergo follow procedure : blood test , urine sample , physical exam EKG . Participants see weekly review side effect , medication take , blood test physical exam . - For Group 2 participant : Prior autologous transplant , Group 2 participant undergo several procedure make Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine . 1 ) Dendritic Cell Collection via leukapheresis 2 ) Tumor cell collection participant bone marrow . One week receive CT-011 infusion , Group 2 participant receive study vaccine total 3 vaccine . - After final treatment Group 1 Group 2 participant receive tumor DTH injection DTH Candida skin . At one , three six month follow last study treatment participant blood test , urine test , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy skeletal survey . At two , four five month , participant blood test .</detailed_description>
