	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether bevacizumab , capecitabine oxaliplatin effective safe first line treatment elderly patient metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy/Safety Study Bevacizumab , Capecitabine , Oxaliplatin Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Elderly Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy determine objective response rate follow RECIST criterion . In several clinical trial Bevacizumab , demonstrate elderly patient benefit well young combination therapy chemotherapy plus Bevacizumab , result come subgroup analysis trial specifically design test effect combination elderly . This clinical trial specific elderly patient expect confirm benefit demonstrate clinical trial elderly patient number reduce . This clinical trial include 3 substudies : - Assessment tumor response CRC liver metastases treatment Avastin combination Capecitabine Oxaliplatin first line treatment dynamic ultrasound contrast . Main objective : Assess performance dynamic contrast ultrasonography ( CEUS , Contrast Enhanced UltraSound ) quantification tumor perfusion evaluation tumor response liver metastases colorectal carcinoma treatment Avastin combination Capecitabine Oxaliplatin . -Evaluation antiangiogenic activity bevacizumab combine oxaliplatin capecitabine first line treatment use MDCT perfusion study liver metastasis colorectal cancer patient 70 year . Main objective : Determine whether observe change perfusion CT study perform 2 week start treatment compare baseline significant predictor free time disease progression patient trial define time since start treatment objective progressive disease RECIST criterion . -Characterization resistance bevacizumab colon cancer elderly patient . Main objective : To evaluate involvement serum marker marker primary tumor resistance bevacizumab .</detailed_description>
