	<brief_title>ApoA-I Synthesis Stimulation Intravascular Ultrasound Coronary Atheroma Regression Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-third US population , almost 80 million adult , cardiovascular disease mortality associate heart disease still remain leading cause death around world . The major risk factor cardiovascular disease associate atherosclerosis dyslipidemia , characterize high level low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and/or low level high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) . The widespread use statins patient risk cardiovascular disease lead low LDL level little effect HDL level . HDL well establish role atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease protection . HDL mediate removal cholesterol atherosclerotic plaque elimination body . The major component HDL consist apolipoprotein A-I ( ApoA I ) . Recent intervention study synthetic HDL particle recombinant ApoA-I show HDL capacity reverse coronary atherosclerosis . Increasing ApoA-I likely favorable effect atherosclerotic plaque stability size cardiovascular disease . RVX000222 member novel class small molecule candidate treatment dyslipidemia increase plasma level HDL increase ApoA-I transcription .</detailed_description>
