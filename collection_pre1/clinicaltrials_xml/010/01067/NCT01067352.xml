	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluate Correlation Between Spontaneous Catch-up Growth , Clinical Response Saizen ( Recombinant Human Growth Hormone , r-hGH ) Gene Expression Profiling Children Small Gestational Age ( SGA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open , multicentric , randomize , control study plan identify gene activate hGH SGA child responder treatment ( make possible near future good identify SGA child likely benefit hGH treatment ) . Furthermore , study would hopefully allow verify gene responsible spontaneous catch-up growth child diagnosis SGA birth third percentile height age 24 month , gene activate hGH treatment participant responder . Sixty child born term ( i.e . 37th complete week gestation ) diagnosis SGA ( define length less tenth percentile accord Italian reference table publish Bertini Fabris ) plan enrol study . Forty participant ( group A ) still less third percentile height ( accord Tanner reference table ) age 24 month , remain 20 ( group B ) equal third percentile ( thus show spontaneous catch-up growth ) . Group A randomize receive Saizen daily dose 0.067 mg/kg ( Group A1 ) treatment ( Group A2 ) two year . All participant undergo full clinical examination blood chemistry baseline visit visit 1,6,12,18 24 month period two year . Gene expression analysis use Clontech Atlas Human Array perform participant baseline one year order identify possible correlation catch-up growth ( either spontaneous drug-induced ) expression gene . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To evaluate correlation gene expression profile catch-up growth ( either spontaneous drug induce one year treatment ) SGA child . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate percentage participant treat show spontaneous catch-up growth two year observation . - To assess safety tolerability early treatment Saizen</detailed_description>
