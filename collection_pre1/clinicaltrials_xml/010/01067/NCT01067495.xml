	<brief_summary>Despite similarity heart disease stroke term disease process elevate risk recurrent event , exercise-based program akin cardiac rehabilitation available people stroke . The purpose study examine 1 ) feasibility adapt cardiac rehabilitation individual stroke , 2 ) effect program aerobic capacity , walking , risk factor , community integration quality life . The investigator anticipate cardiac rehabilitation may appropriately adapt accommodate individual stroke range functional ability , program effective improving aerobic capacity , walk ability stroke risk factor . The investigator also anticipate participant demonstrate improve community integration quality life follow program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adapted Cardiac Rehabilitation After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There many parallel heart disease stroke , include cardiovascular etiology , presence co-morbidities similarity risk factor . Cardiac rehabilitation well-established successful model care individual heart disease focus exercise risk factor modification . Yet analogous secondary prevention program stroke program readily available . The main research question : What feasibility effect cardiac rehabilitation individual follow stroke ? The objective : 1 . To determine stroke survivor able willing participate cardiac rehabilitation program . Specifically , determine feasibility cardiac rehabilitation program individual follow stroke determine compliance attendance training requirement . 2 . To determine cardiac rehabilitation program meaningful benefit , among chronic stroke survivor , : - walking capacity ability : consider functional capacity [ endurance / distance ] quality [ neuromotor control ] , - community integration : consider quantity [ activity monitor ] quality [ index reintegration normal living ] activity - health-related quality life : determine stroke specific index - risk factor subsequent stroke : include exercise capacity , blood pressure , blood lipid profile</detailed_description>
