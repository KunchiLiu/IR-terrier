	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Single Versus Double Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation Young With Acute Leukemia Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale : Unrelated cord blood transplantation ( UCBT ) use several year HLA identical sibling unrelated donor . During year 2007 , 218 783 unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( 28 % ) carry France UCBT . This proportion 37 % child ( 58/157 ) . Clinical outcome UCBT strongly depend transplant cell dose . Since recent publication encourage result transplantation two UCB unit , number double-transplantations increase significant way . Thus 121/218 UCBT perform France 2007 double-transplantations ( 55 % ) whereas proportion 81/180 ( 45 % ) 2006 , 30/144 ( 21 % ) 2005 , 5/77 ( 6 % ) 2004 0/44 2003 . However , currently prospective study compare reliable way double-transplantation single-transplantation result . Study design : The investigator propose prospective randomize study compare result single versus double unit UCBT child young adult ( &lt; 35 yr ) acute leukemia remission . This open , multicenter study carry allogeneic transplant center French society hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cell therapy ( Société Française de Greffe de Moelle et de Thérapie Cellulaire , SFGM-TC ) . Objectives : The primary objective compare incidence transplantation failure two treatment arm . Transplantation failure , primary endpoint study , define occurrence one follow event : transplant-related death , second allogeneic transplantation autologous backup infusion primary engraftment failure , autologous recovery . The financial impact double-transplantations date unknown , project also include cost-effectiveness study , effectiveness criterion decrease transplantation failure incidence . The secondary clinical endpoint : overall survival disease-free survival , relapse incidence , transplant-related mortality , incidence severe infection GvHD . The secondary biological endpoint : hematological immunological recovery , post transplant chimerism . Methods : Transplantation method : Myeloablative condition regimen include , accord patient age , either total body irradiation , fludarabine cyclophosphamide GvHD prophylaxis base cyclosporine A mycophenolate , association busulfan , cyclophosphamide anti-thymocyte globulin GvHD prophylaxis cyclosporine A steroid . Statistical method : The experimental schedule base multiple testing procedure , use method describe O ' Brien Fleming . This offer possibility stop trial end inclusion significant difference two arm occurs . In trial , two sequential analysis plan : interim analysis 18 month final analysis 36 month . Probabilities survival DFS estimate accord Kaplan-Meier method . In presence one several competitive risk , cumulative incidence event estimate accord method Gray . Thus , relapse compete risk transplantation failure study primary endpoint evaluation . Comparisons two treatment arm carry Log rank test Kaplan-Meier estimate Gray 's test cumulate incidence . The intent treat analysis ( accord random allocation ) prefer per-protocol analysis additional analysis . An independent committee make order control decision study continuation stopping time interim analysis . Sample calculation , study feasibility duration : In set sequential trial include one interim analysis , cumulate incidence transplantation failure hypothesis 40 % single-transplantation 20 % double-transplantation arm ( alpha risk , 5 % , power , 80 % , 5 % non evaluable patient ) , estimate sample size 99 group , i.e . total 198 . Taking account UCBT activity France ( data French biomedicine agency ) , enrolment phase study plan last 30 month . Minimum post-transplant follow-up duration 6 month , duration study 3 year .</detailed_description>
