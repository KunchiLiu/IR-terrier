	<brief_summary>Scientists believe happen dietary fat eat , especially clear blood , affect risks heart disease diabetes important measure blood fat overnight fast . Little known happen 6-8 hour eat common oil available Canada soybean , canola , olive , sunflower flax oil . Vegetable oils different type fatty acid . This study gather information happen fatty acid eat meal . The purpose research show clearance fat blood varies type vegetable oil meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose present study show type vegetable oil meal alter postprandial lipaemia transport n-3 fatty acid . The hypothesis meal low 18:2n-6 high monounsaturated fatty acid 18:1n-9 18:3n-3 result lower postprandial lipaemia high long chain n-3 fatty acid unesterified fatty acid compare meal either high 18:2n-6 low 18:3n-3 . The specific objective determine magnitude duration increase plasma TG fatty acid composition chylomicron , LDL HDL unesterified fatty acid 8 hour follow intake standard meal approx 35- 40 % energy fat contain different vegetable oil . The objective show amount balance 18:1n-9 , 18:2n-6 18:3n-3 meal important determinant extent duration postprandial lipaemia , appearance 18:3n-3 metabolite TG unesterified fatty acid . We use test meal prepare different amount common fat oil provide vary 18:2n-6 , 18:3n-3 18:1n-9 . All meal provide less 10 % energy saturate fatty acid approx 35 % total energy fat . We also aim identify useful single time point show difference plasma post-prandial lipaemia fatty acid use study sequential , repeat blood sample post meal phase practical . Subject characteristic baseline parameter present use descriptive statistic . Differences TG response among subject different fat oil assess use ANOVA , use ANCOVA . Differences fatty acids time point among diet compare use ANOVA . Prior analysis , data check display non normal distribution . A P-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
