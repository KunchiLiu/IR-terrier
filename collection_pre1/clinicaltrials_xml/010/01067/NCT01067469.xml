	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination bevacizumab lomustine help control glioblastoma . The safety combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Dose Bevacizumab Versus Low Dose Bevacizumab Plus Lomustine ( CCNU ) Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel . Lomustine design damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) tumor cell , may cause tumor cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance either group . - If Group 1 , receive high dose bevacizumab . - If Group 2 , receive lomustine low dose bevacizumab Study Drug Administration : Each treatment cycle 42 day . If Group 1 : On Days 1 , 15 , 29 every cycle , receive bevacizumab vein 90 minute . If Group 2 : - On Days 1 22 every cycle , receive bevacizumab vein 90 minute . - On Day 3 every cycle , take lomustine mouth 1 time day . You take lomustine bedtime 1 hour 2 hour last meal day 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Study Visits : If Group 1 2 , every 6 week : - You ask drug may take side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . - You MRI scan . - If anti-seizure drug , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure amount anti-seizure drug blood . If Group 1 : - During Weeks 1-6 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test 1 time week . - After Week 6 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test every 2 week . - On Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , every 6 week , urine collect check kidney function . If Group 2 : - During Weeks 1-6 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test 1 time week . - After Week 6 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test every 3 week . - On Weeks 3 6 , every 6 week , urine collect check kidney function . Length Study : You may stay study treatment lomustine and/or bevacizumab 1 1/2 year . After , may continue take bevacizumab long study doctor think best interest . You take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End Study Treatment Visit : After study treatment , end study treatment visit . At visit , may follow test procedure perform : - You ask drug may take side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . Long-Term Follow-up : After end study treatment visit , study staff call every 3 month check . Each phone call take 5 minute . This investigational study . Bevacizumab lomustine FDA approve drug commercially available treatment brain tumor . The use drug combination investigational . Up 102 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
