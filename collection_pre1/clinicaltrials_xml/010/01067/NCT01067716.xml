	<criteria>Male female , race , least 21 year old time preoperative examination sign consent form . The refractive error , base manifest refraction spectacle plane , : MRSE 15.00 D manifest cylinder 0.00 6.00 D ; MRSE +7.00 D , manifest cylinder 0.00 6.00 D ; Manifest cylinder ( 1.0 6.0 D ) great magnitude sphere , manifest cylinder sphere opposite sign . BSCVA 20/20 better . UCVA 20/40 worse . Manifest refraction sphere within ± 0.75 D cycloplegic refraction sphere ( vertex distance ) . Anticipated postoperative stromal bed thickness least 250 micron , base preoperative central corneal pachymetry minus maximum treatment depth ablate intend flap thickness , confirm intraoperative central corneal pachymetry . Anticipated postoperative keratometry value ( base preoperative manifest refraction keratometry ) appropriate . A stable refractive error , base exam ( prescription ) least 12 month prior preoperative examination compare preoperative manifest refraction Subjects worn contact lens operative eye must discontinue lens wear least three ( 3 ) consecutive week prior preoperative examination . If , upon review preoperative measurement , Investigator determine corneal topography within normal limit , surgery may schedule ( within 60 day ) , contact lens wear permitted prior surgery . Willing capable return followup examination duration study ( 6 month ) . Women pregnant , breastfeeding , intend become pregnant course study , determine verbal inquiry . Concurrent use topical systemic medication may impair heal , include limited : antimetabolite , isotretinoin ( Accutane® ) within 6 month treatment , amiodarone hydrochloride ( Cordarone® ) within 12 month treatment . History follow medical condition , condition could affect wound healing : collagen vascular disease , autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency disease , ocular herpes zoster herpes simplex , endocrine disorder ( include , limited unstable thyroid disorder diabetes ) , lupus , rheumatoid arthritis . Subjects cardiac pacemaker implant defibrillator . History prior intraocular corneal surgery ( include cataract extraction ) , active ophthalmic disease abnormality ( include , limited , symptomatic blepharitis , recurrent corneal erosion , dry eye syndrome , neovascularization &gt; 1mm limbus ) , retinal detachment/repair , clinically significant lens opacity , clinical evidence trauma , corneal opacity within central 9 mm , risk develop strabismus , evidence glaucoma propensity narrow angle glaucoma . Evidence keratoconus , corneal dystrophy irregularity , abnormal videokeratography . Known sensitivity inappropriate responsiveness medication use postoperative course . Subjects one eye meet inclusion criterion fall within approved indication treatment use VISX® STAR S4 IR® Excimer Laser . Participation clinical study .</criteria>
