	<brief_summary>Primary Hypothesis : There difference efficacy iron replacement oral intravenous route Inflammatory Bowel Disease patient . Iron deficiency anaemia common problem people inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patient excessive blood loss bowel heavy menstrual loss . Treatment option include blood transfusion , oral iron ( Ferrograd ® ) intravenous iron replacement iron sucrose ( Venofer® ) . Iron deficiency anaemia associate poor quality life , poor concentration span low energy level . Blood transfusion may improve symptomatic anaemia quickly risk transfusion reaction blood bear infection transmission . Moreover , pack cell scarce resource therefore use need carefully prioritize . Oral iron supplement widely use purchase counter , however , efficacy know IBD population . Oral iron poorly tolerate side effect include altered bowel habit , nausea darken stool , make difficult adhere . In contrast , intravenous iron therapy Venofer® show replenish iron store improve anaemia quickly . To date , safety Venofer® use support post marketing surveillance . Limitations intravenous iron replacement include need medical supervision set limited healthcare resource ; need patient take multiple day work cost Venofer® . Currently uncertain method iron replacement well . The purpose study compare efficacy cost oral intravenous iron replacement set iron deficiency anaemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.1 Literature Iron deficiency anemia common major management issue Inflammatory Bowel disease [ 1-3 ] . Moreover , factor identify predict recurrent iron deficiency anemia [ 4 ] . Iron deficiency anemia well recognize cause fatigue , poor concentration decrease energy level impact one 's quality life ability maintain employment managing activity daily live [ 2 , 5 ] . Iron deficiency anemia multi-factorial origin cause divide disease patient origin . Disease factor include active blood loss gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration , impairment iron absorption disease affect proximal small bowel history extensive small bowel resection . Iron absorption utilization may also influence inflammation inducible production hepatic origin peptide hormone call hepcidin [ 5 ] , Interleukin 10 ( IL10 ) [ 6 ] interleukin 6 ( IL 6 ) [ 7 , 8 ] . Inflammatory cytokines Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha ( TNFa ) IL-6 show cause anorexia animal model [ 9 ] . The major patient factor dietary aversion certain food order avoid exacerbation exist symptom [ 10 , 11 ] . Iron replace either orally intravenously . To date five study directly compare oral versus intravenous iron therapy patient inflammatory bowel disease . Three study suggest intravenous iron superior [ 12-14 ] , one suggest oral iron superior [ 15 ] one show difference [ 16 ] . This confusion evident retrospective review gastroenterology outpatient clinic 's experience detect manage iron deficiency anaemia IBD non IBD patient [ 17 ] . Furthermore , study advocate concurrent use Erythropoietin make difficult draw definite conclusion . Studies show iron deficient without anaemia associate reduced cognitive performance reversible iron supplementation . ( 18 ) 19 ) In combination non specific symptom fatigue poor concentration span , many clinician treat iron deficiency anaemia occur . Moreover , World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate number iron deficient people twice diagnose anaemic people , ( 20 ) therefore , appropriate use iron deficiency inclusion criterion . This contrast clinical trial examine iron replacement therapy use iron deficiency anaemia inclusion criterion . The approach stratify route iron replacement therapy degree anaemia logical evidence base . This study seek investigate efficacy intravenous iron versus oral iron replacement iron deficient patient . Bone marrow biopsy stain iron store gold standard assess iron store invasive , therefore surrogate serum marker ferritin iron saturation use clinical practice show accurate . ( 21 ) Low ferritin level associate high ( 78 % -100 % ) specificity low iron saturation high sensitivity iron deficiency ( 59 % -88 % ) . ( 22 ) Moreover , anaemic IBD population , low ferritin level &gt; 90 % specificity iron deficiency . ( 23 ) Given IBD patient 'functional ' iron deficiency elevate ferritin CRP low iron saturation , decide use iron saturation &lt; 16 % ferritin le 100ug/L indicate iron deficient state . This cut consistent laboratory standard University Alberta Hospital . 1.2 Oral Iron Therapy 1.2.1 Oral Iron Adverse Events Oral iron replacement often poorly tolerate evident publish study adverse reaction rate report high 80 % [ 12 ] , discontinuation rate 25 % [ 16 , 18 ] . Less half patient able tolerate prescribe dose oral iron [ 14 ] . Some report suggest oral iron therapy associate worsen IBD disease activity [ 12 ] , although consistently [ 14 ] . Finally , controversy regard whether oral iron replacement could exacerbate underlying disease increase oxidative stress [ 18 ] . 1.2.2 . Oral Iron Efficacy Semrin et al demonstrate oral iron absorption significantly impair context active Crohn 's disease compare inactive disease state [ 7 ] . In literature , efficacy oral iron replacement often define improvement haemoglobin level 20g/L baseline report high 89 % [ 15 ] . It worth note baseline haemoglobin oral replacement cohort study Gisbert et al significantly higher intravenous cohort . When use iron study endpoint , 60 % oral iron treatment group iron deficient 5 month tolerate dose oral iron replacement [ 14 ] . 1.3 Intravenous Iron Therapy 1.3.1 Intravenous Iron Adverse Events The alternative oral iron intravenous iron replacement formulation change time . Chertow et al review US FDA intravenous iron adverse event data 2001-2003 confirm 20 time higher rate life threaten adverse event high molecular weight iron dextran iron sucrose [ 19 ] . Iron sucrose ( 1.4+/- 0.5g ) show increase HB 20g/L and/or normalize haemoglobin 91 % cohort within 12 week treatment [ 20 ] . Studies show intravenous iron therapy well tolerate oral iron , low discontinuation rate [ 13 ] definite improvement serum ferritin [ 16 ] . Intravenous iron replacement ensure adequate total iron replacement n't issue compliance independent intestinal absorption . Iron sucrose show efficacious oral iron replacement inadequate intolerable [ 20 ] . The disadvantage intravenous iron include time consume patient , much expensive oral formulation ancillary cost . It uncertain true cost intravenous iron replacement without factor efficacy , compliance lack side effect . Intravenous iron usage show cost effective chronic renal failure patient dialysis insufficient iron store maximum tolerated oral supplement [ 21 ] . 1.3.2 Intravenous Iron Efficacy There five direct comparative oral versus intravenous iron replacement study . The early comparative study involve small number subject , 19 patient , short treatment duration 2 week [ 12 ] 6 week [ 16 ] one study , baseline entry criterion two group different [ 15 ] . Appendix one summarise study . 1.4 Potential Aggravating Effects Iron Therapy Inflammatory Bowel Disease . The role oral iron cause intestinal oxidative stress subsequently increase risk colorectal dysplasia controversial one . Lund et al use 18 healthy volunteer demonstrate unabsorbed dietary iron associate 40 % increase stool free radical formation carcinogens production [ 22 ] . The hypothesis dietary iron serve catalyst formation highly reactive radical via Fenton reaction [ 23 , 24 ] thereby cause cellular damage [ 25 ] contribute carcinogenesis demonstrate animal model [ 26 , 27 ] . A recent mouse model Seril et al demonstrated superiority intraperitoneal iron supplementation replenish splenic iron store without increase colorectal dysplasia rate compare mouse feed oral iron supplement [ 28 ] . Interestingly , conflict report regard role intravenous iron replacement increase plasma oxidative stress [ 12 , 29 ] significance data unknown . Currently , limit human literature available address issue . HYPOTHESIS : Primary : There difference efficacy iron replacement oral intravenous route IBD patient . Secondary : There difference tolerability oral intravenous iron therapy . The route iron replacement impact colonic bacterial flora composition , underlie IBD state oxidative stress colonic mucosa determine colonic biopsy analyze endoplasmic reticulum stress . Oral iron replacement therapy cheap efficacious way replace iron compare intravenous replacement . 2 Trial Design 2.1 Primary Endpoint Change iron saturation week 8 post initiation treatment . 2.2 Secondary Endpoints To describe change haemoglobin , ferritin , IBDQ , HBI partial MAYO score patient iron replacement . To describe change colonic endoplasmic reticulum indicator oxidative stress . To describe change urinary metabolomics iron replacement To describe change faecal bacteria composition pre post iron replacement . 2.3 Study Design/Type Open label Randomised Control Trial observer blind . 2.4 Randomization Eligible comer randomize either IV PO iron therapy 1:1 ratio . Randomization perform externally hold EPICORE centre . EPICORE centre maintain randomization code . 3.1 Trial Treatment/ Duration 3.2 Dose determination : - Total amount intravenous iron give calculate Ganzoni Equation : Iron dose ( mg ) = body weight ( kg ) x ( ideal Hb - actual Hb ) x 0.24 + 15mg/kg iron depot 3.3 Iron Sucrose : Administered IV infusion ( dilute 5 mL ( equiv . Fe 100 mg ) 100ml NaCl 0.9 % ) . Maximum amount iron sucrose 300mg per infusion per week . 3.4 Oral iron : 200mg equivalent elemental iron give twice day 3 month . 3.5 Discontinuation - withdrawal consent - Significant adverse event hypersensitivity reaction , dyspnoea myalgia iron sucrose . ( see appendix 2 ) - Recurrent intolerable non hypersensitivity reaction fatigue GI disturbance . 3.6 Product Accountability Iron tablet pill count take place monthly review . 3.7 Data Identification Appendix 3 : Trial activity Schedule .</detailed_description>
