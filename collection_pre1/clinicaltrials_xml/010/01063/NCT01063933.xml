	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Safety Evaluation Intravenous Peramivir Children With Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants young child great risk mortality epidemic influenza . Influenza medication currently approve use United States administer orally via inhalation . Availability parenteral influenza medication could great importance medical public health response seasonal pandemic influenza . Peramivir experimental parenteral influenza drug advance stage clinical development . The primary objective study define pharmacokinetics ( PK ) peramivir child confirm influenza . The secondary objective : ass safety tolerability intravenous ( IV ) peramivir child influenza ; assess viral dynamic function drug PK ; assess virus susceptibility peramivir . This study prospective , open-label , age-stratified PK/pharmacodynamic ( PD ) safety evaluation investigational IV peramivir hospitalize child influenza infection unable receive fail least three day oseltamivir zanamivir therapy . A minimum 63 child confirm influenza enrol 1 7 age cohort : Cohort I ( &gt; = 12 year &lt; 18 year ) ; Cohort II ( &gt; = 6 year &lt; 12 year ) ; Cohort III ( &gt; = 2 year &lt; 6 year ) ; Cohort IV ( &gt; = 181 day &lt; 2 year ) ; Cohort V ( &gt; = 91 day &lt; 181 day ) ; Cohort VI ( &gt; = 31 day &lt; 91 day ) Cohort VII ( Birth &lt; 31 day ) . Only hospitalized child enrol . At study onset , Cohorts I , II III ( child &gt; =2 year &lt; 18 year age ) enrol initially . When PK safety data 9 total subject enrol Cohort I , Cohort II and/or Cohort IIII available review study 's Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , Cohorts IV-VII open enrollment . The initial dos select use base modeling recently complete clinical trial study fix dose ( 10 mg/kg ) peramivir pediatric patient influenza . In current study , PK data obtain real time basis , dose cohort may modify target exposure [ area curve ( AUC ) 24 ] fall outside pre-specified range . Additional enrollment may allow dose require modification give cohort . In event public health emergency , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , DSMB , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) may cohorts open enrollment . Subjects receive IV Peramivir daily 5 day day hospital discharge , whichever come first , PK blood draw obtain around second dose . In addition PK PD , study carefully assess clinical disease course adverse event ( AEs ) , include neurologic AEs . Safety evaluation also include neurologic assessment , general physical assessment , AE serious adverse event ( SAE ) reporting . Sequential nasopharyngeal specimen obtain virologic assessment , include viral culture , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) viral ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) ( quantitative ) , analysis antiviral resistance .</detailed_description>
