	<brief_summary>Background : - The CB1 receptor protein brain target active ingredient cannabis ( marijuana ) . Brain system react cannabis may involve cause symptom schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . For instance , research study show number CB1 receptor may different people schizophrenia , may differences receptor . Researchers interested use positron emission tomography ( PET ) study CB1 receptor people without schizophrenia , use chemical tracer attach specifically CB1 receptor . Objectives : - To determine whether CB1 receptor brain protein different people without schizophrenia . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age either diagnose schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants study must previously enrol National Institute Mental Health protocol A Neurobiological Investigation Patients Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Their Siblings ( 95-M-0150 ) . - Participants provide blood sample test gene contains information specific type CB1 receptor participant . - Participants PET scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . - The PET scan last approximately 2 hour . Participants receive injection small amount chemical tracer improve quality image take scan . - The MRI scan last approximately 1 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia debilitate mental disorder complex multifactorial etiology . The exact pathophysiological mechanism remain elusive , large body evidence point toward abnormality number brain neurotransmitter system : dopamine , glutamate , gamma-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) . Pharmacological study show acute exposure cannabis able induce psychotic symptom healthy individual exacerbate symptom patient establish psychotic illness . In addition , epidemiological study establish cannabis use early adolescence associate increase risk develop schizophrenia later life . Together , evidence suggest neural system target cannabis may involve pathophysiology schizophrenia . The brain endocannabinoid ( EC ) system recently discover brain neurotransmission system , involve endogenous cannabinoid agent ( ECs ) act upon specific receptor ( CB1 CB2 ) . CB1 receptor abundant human brain act inhibitory modulator classical neurotransmitter . ECs CB1 receptor appear involve pathophysiology schizophrenia . EC level elevate cerebrospinal fluid patient schizophrenia , post-mortem study show increased density radioligand bind brain CB1 receptor . To extent CB1 receptor involve pathophysiology schizophrenia live human brain currently unknown . The lack suitable method reliably quantify CB1 receptor live human brain date hinder progress field . In protocol , outline study aim elucidate role CB1 receptor schizophrenia use positron emission tomography ( PET ) recently develop radiotracer CB1 receptor , [ 18F ] FMPEP-d ( 2 ) . The aim project explore CB1 receptor abnormality human patient schizophrenia . The primary hypothesis CB1 receptor density increase patient schizophrenia comparison healthy subject . Insight role CB1 receptor function schizophrenia may help guide future development pharmacotherapies .</detailed_description>
