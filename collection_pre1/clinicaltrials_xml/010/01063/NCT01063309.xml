	<brief_summary>Background : - Atherosclerosis , arterial plaque blockage cause heart disease , develop many people time mid-20s . The rate atherosclerosis patient immune system disorder well study , may different general population . - Patients chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) produce less group molecule know free radical , help fight infection may play role development atherosclerosis . Patients CGD may develop atherosclerosis much slowly people without CGD . On hand , carrier mother child genetically-linked CGD often problem autoimmune problem addition problem make free radical . Patients immune system disorder also different response infection , many also autoimmune-like problem may change risk develop atherosclerosis . Objectives : - To study prevalence atherosclerosis patient immune system disorder , compare healthy individual . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age either diagnose immune system disorder healthy volunteer . Design : - The active part study involve one two visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center series image test scan . - Participants follow test active part study : - ( 1 ) CAT scan obtain image chest artery measure amount calcium artery wall . - ( 2 ) Magnetic resonance image scan obtain image coronary carotid artery chest neck . - ( 3 ) Electrocardiogram provide data current heart function . - ( 4 ) Blood sample provide data heart , kidney , immune system function . - Participants contact every 2 year future 30 year determine whether developed heart disease . Researchers ask participant provide contact information two people may likely know get touch participant future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart disease kill half million people U.S. year . Atherosclerosis , major cause heart disease , think relate dysregulated inflammation cardiac blood vessel possibly result production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . The rate atherosclerosis patient disorder immune system well characterize likely dramatically different see general population . Specifically , patient Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) may protect develop atherosclerosis due reduce superoxide ROS production phagocytic cell . We hypothesize patient CGD decrease risk develop atherosclerosis . The primary objective study determine prevalence atherosclerosis inflammatory characteristic patient in-born disorder immune function . The primary objective assess use image technique measure coronary artery calcium score presence absence soft plaque . Secondary endpoint include physiologic characteristic blood pressure well circulate biomarkers associate heart disease C-reactive protein lipid profile . This study may lead improved understanding pathophysiology atherosclerosis , specifically role free radical stress , could lead novel therapy atherosclerosis may benefit patient immune disorder general population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients identify protocol enrol exist protocol study patient disorder immune system volunteer participation list exclusion criterion . Patients remain enrolled exist protocol . Normal volunteer enrol control protocol . They recruit normal volunteer office provide list volunteer include age allow inclusion control approximate study population . All patient enrol protocol age 18 may male female accrue without regard religion , race sexual orientation . They must able understand sign inform consent document comply study procedure include undergo CT scan MRI scan . Patients unable unwilling complete one study exclude . The available data include appropriate analysis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For Participation MRIBased Studies Only : 1 . Subjects contraindication MRI scanning . These contraindication include limited following device condition : 1 . Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator 2 . Cochlear Implants 3 . Ocular foreign body ( i.e. , metal shaving ) 4 . Embedded shrapnel fragment 5 . Central nervous system aneurysm clip 6 . Implanted neural stimulator 7 . Medical infusion pump 8 . Any implanted device incompatible MRI 2 . Patients whose medical condition refer physician estimation , could tolerate MRI scan . Examples medical condition would accept would include unstable angina dyspnea rest . 3 . Subjects condition preclude entry scanner ( e.g . morbid obesity , claustrophobia , etc . ) require sedation anxiety associate MRI study . 4 . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study excessive exposure develop human fetus child radiation and/or intravenous contrast agent detrimental . 5 . Subjects severe backpain motion disorder unable tolerate supine position within MRI scanner hold still duration examination . For GadoliniumBased MRI Studies Only : 6 . History severe allergic reaction gadolinium contrast agent despite use premedication antihistaminic and/or corticosteroid . 7. eGFR less 60mL/min 8 . Serum creatinine great 3.0 mg/dl For IodineBased Contrast CT Studies Only : 9 . Contraindication use iodine base CT contrast agent : 1 . Serum creatinine great 1.4 mg/dl 2 . History multiple myeloma 3 . Use metformincontaining product le 24 hour prior contrast administration 4 . History significant allergic reaction CT contrast agent despite use premedication antihistaminic cortisone . For Coronary CT Angiography Only : 10 . Contraindication use CT contrast agent : 1 . Creatinine value great than1.4 mg/dl 2 . History multiple myeloma 3 . Use metformincontaining product le 24 hour prior contrast administration 4 . History significant allergic reaction CT contrast agent despite use premedication antihistaminic cortisone . 11 . Subjects contraindication preclude use beta blocker necessary perform coronary CT angiography . These include : 1 . Severe , uncontrolled asthma 2 . Active bronchospasm 3 . Moderate severe COPD 4 . 2nd 3rd degree AV block 5 . Decompensated cardiac failure 6 . Allergy beta blocker 7 . Systolic blood pressure less than100 mm Hg 8 . Pregnancy nurse Participation Minors : Atherosclerosis disease generally affect young child . This protocol involve exposure low dose radiation . As radiation exposure may increase risk malignancy , prudent avoid child . Therefore , patient age 18 consider enrollment protocol . Participation Women : Excessive radiation exposure develop human fetus detrimental . For reason , woman childbearingage pregnancy test prior undergo study procedure . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , immediately inform study staff primary care physician . Pregnancy : Pregnant woman exclude study excessive exposure develop human fetus radiation detrimental . Coenrollment Guidelines : Coenrollment trial restrict . Medical Exclusions : Patients current atrial fibrillation consider enrollment protocol . Patients medically unstable ( e.g . severe sepsis , acute myocardial infarction ) and/or would require active , acute medical management order medically stable enough participate protocol enrol . Xlinked CGD Cohort : Patients cohort must Xlinked CGD demonstrate DHR genetic screening . Patients undergone bone marrow transplant may enrol cohort analysis . AutosomalRecessive CGD Cohort : Patients cohort must autosomal recessive CGD ( p47phox , p67phox , p22phox deficiency ) demonstrate DHR genetic screening . Patients undergone bone marrow transplant may enrol cohort analysis . Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort : Patients enrol cohort may diagnose CGD . Normal Volunteer Cohort : Patients cohort may diagnose CGD , Inflammatory Bowel Disease , another primary disease immune system .</criteria>
