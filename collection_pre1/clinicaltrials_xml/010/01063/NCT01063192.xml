	<brief_summary>The primary end point evaluate time progression gemcitabine alone versus Gemcitabine-based combination induction chemotherapy follow concurrent chemoradiotherapy locally advanced pancreatic cancer . The secondary end point evaluate disease control rate , overall survival time , toxicity profile compliance induction chemotherapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy well disease control rate inductional chemotherapy alone locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Translational research include pharmacogenomic study biomarker study also do concomitantly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients randomize two study arm stratify resectability status ( borderline resectable unresectable ) enrollment . Eligible patient randomly assign 1:1 basis either two study group , use central randomization procedure stratification accord NCCN criterion resectability . After randomization , induction chemotherapy ( ICT ) administer 3 cycle ( 3 month ) . Patients radiological evidence distant dissemination shift salvage chemotherapy . Patients responsive , stable disease well localize progressive disease ICT receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) 3-4 week last dose ICT . Surgical evaluation perform 4-6 week completion CCRT . Patients respectable disease undergo surgical resection . Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy 3 cycle ( 3 month ) give consider curative resection . Patients still unresectable disease non-curative resection receive systemic chemotherapy till disease progression unacceptable toxicity . For Arm 1 , ICT gemcitabine ( fix rate 10mg/m2/min , 1000mg/m2 day 1,8,15 every 28 days/cycle ) administer 3-week-on-one-week-off weekly basis . For Arm 2 , ICT GOFL ( 800mg/m2 gemcitabine fix rate 10mg/m2/min follow 2-hour oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 48-hour 3000mg/m2 5-FU 150 mg/m2 leucovorin day 1 15 every 28 days/cycle ) give biweekly . After three 3 cycle ICT , patient without distant metastasis give CCRT gemcitabine 400mg/m2 2 hr RT day1,8,15,22,29,36 . Radiation give 180cGy per day , 5 day week 28 fraction totally 5040cGy . If complete surgical resection feasible , optimal surgery perform 4-6 week CCRT . If complete surgical resection impossible , biopsy without bypass surgery may perform . Patients curative surgical resection receive additional 6 cycle ( 6 month ) adjuvant chemotherapy ( Arm1 , gemcitabine alone ; Arm 2 , GOFL ) within 4 week surgery follow tumor progression . Patients feasible curative resection , receive continue chemotherapy ( Arm1 , gemcitabine alone ; Arm2 , GOFL ) 3-4 week CCRT complete . The regimen continue till disease progression .</detailed_description>
