	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study Short-term Effects Gastric Bypass Glucose Homeostasis Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1987 Pories et al . ( 1 ) publish gastric bypass 99 % morbidly obese patient become remained euglycaemic time . However , interest observation author ( 1 ) patient convert euglycaemia within 10 day operation , even require large dos insulin . Thereafter , ( 2-6 ) well Authors ( 7,8 ) find mainly malabsorptive bariatric mainly restrictive surgery effective produce early improvement/resolution type 2 diabetes , also normal weight ( 9 ) overweight-obese subject ( 10 ) . Until mechanisms bariatric surgery operate improve insulin sensitivity , consequently , diabetes control elucidate . To complicate picture fact bariatric surgery patient allow eat time longer entity abdominal trauma increase . In fact , laparoscopic bariatric surgery patient re-alimented 3rd post-operative day open surgery time length re-alimentation 7 day . Although centre patient receive parenteral nutrition cover energy need remain rest , centre re-hydrated . Thus , might hypothesise fast contribute improvement glucose disposal . The data literature counteract possibility many Authors ( 11-15 ) demonstrate very-low calorie diet ( VLCD ) essentially unable improve insulin sensitivity least short run , weight loss minimal . In regard , Jazet et al . ( 11 ) find glucose control amelioration diabetic subject undergo 2-day VLCD reduction hepatic glucose production rather improvement whole-body glucose disposal . Similarly , Christiansen et al ( 12 ) observe increase glucose metabolic clearance rate ( MCR ) apparent day 20 energy restriction , weight loss become significant . In another study , diabetic patient 4-day energy-restricted diet ( provide 4620 ± 1050 kJ/d ) deterioration basal glucose MCR insulin-stimulated glucose disposal ( 13 ) . Recently , Laferrère et al ( 16 ) compare late ( 1 month ) effect equivalent weight loss RYGB diet two group match morbidly obese patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . The glucose area under-the-curve ( AUC ) oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) glucose level 120 ' significantly low RYGB compare diet ( P = 0.014 P = 0.001 , respectively ) . Another important aspect weight loss modulation lipolysis . Many study show obese subject insulin resistant level adipose tissue , ie , despite high plasma insulin level lipolysis FFA release suppress . It therefore interest study change lipolysis surgery also ability insulin ( e.g. , euglycemic , hyperinsulinemic clamp ) suppress peripheral lipolysis . By infuse deuterated glycerol able estimate glycerol rate appearance , best available index lipolysis . In fact intracellular triglyceride ( TG ) hydrolysis result release one mole glycerol 3 mole FFA . While FFA re-esterified intracellularly , thus appear systemic circulation , glycerol re-esterified since adipocyte lack glycerol kinase . Thus , glycerol derive intracellular TG hydrolysis release circulation trace deuterated glycerol . We use technique previously diabetic subject ( 17 ) , subject NASH well obese subject VLCD ( 18 ) . In latter study show VLCD improve adipose tissue IR . As far know , data available literature compare effect RYGB purely restrictive bariatric procedure order take account simultaneously effect surgical trauma reduce food intake early post-operative period . The main goal study determine immediate effect Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery glucose homeostasis , factor confound effect surgical approach ( incl . laparoscopy ) post-operative fasting . To purpose , patient two bariatric surgery group ( Roux-en-Y gastric bypass gastric banding ) match far feasible . Primary parameter insulin resistance ( assess Matsuda index ) . Further BMI inclusion criterion apply group ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 &lt; 55 kg/m2 ) . While age , gender BMI within specify range also expect influence read-out , match baseline characteristic foreseen due feasibility issue . Patients receive oral food typically day 3 4 laparoscopic bariatric surgery . This post-operative food intake restrict 800 - 1000 kcal/day , usually divide 6 small meal , follow composition 55 % carbohydrate , 30 % lipid 15 % protein ; saturate lipid ~ 10 % . A similar caloric intake restriction impose 1-week diet period prior Visit 3 , do 10 +/- 2 week operation order allow patient complete recovery his/her body weight must keep constant next study order avoid methodological bias .</detailed_description>
