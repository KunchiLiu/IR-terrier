	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate long term effect exercise therapy patient education compare patient education individual hip OA , evaluate predictive factor change hip osteoarthritis clinically x-ray . Main hypothesis H01 : There significant long term ( 2 year ) differences hip function , quality life , physical function radiological change individual go patient education program 12 week exercise therapy program compare patient education program . Material Methods : 109 patient radiographically verify hip OA include randomize control trial ; randomize 12 week exercise therapy program patient education ( n=55 ) patient education program ( n=54 ) . Data collect 2 year complete intervention period original RCT , 6 month 2 year postoperatively patient undergone total hip arthroplasty . The main outcome : The Disease Specific WOMAC-Index . Secondary outcome measure : Hip X-ray , SF-36v2 ( quality life ) , PASE ( activity score ) , Self-efficacy pain , isokinetic muscle strength test , 6 minute walk test , Åstrand 's bike test , range motion . Status : This study prolongation on-going RCT ( 3a-2005-NAR ) . The inclusion , intervention follow-up include 1 year follow-up complete . 2 year post-intervention follow-up complete 2010 , 2 year follow-up postoperative patient undergoing total hip artroplasty continue throughout 2011 . The study carry : NAR-Orthopedic Centre , Ullevaal University Hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims Aim 1 To evaluate long-term effect patient education program 12 week exercise therapy program ( IG ) compare patient education ( CG ) hip function , quality life physical function patient hip OA eligible total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) time inclusion Aim 2 1 . To examine difference radiographic change individual go patient education program 12 week exercise therapy program ( IG ) compare go patient education program ( CG ) 2 year inclusion . 2 . To examine predictive factor radiographic change change hip function 2 year follow-up inclusion . Aim 3 1 . To evaluate hip function , quality life physical function patient go total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) 2 . To examine difference hip function , quality life , physical function patient prior surgery go patient education program 12 week exercise therapy program ( IG ) compare patient go patient education program ( CG ) 6 month THA . Material method Design : This study prospective , randomized clinical trial examine long term effect two different intervention patient hip OA . The long term follow-up base ongoing study ( 03a-2005-NAR ) short term outcome . Patients : 109 patient recruit Orthopaedic Center , Ullevål University Hospital , NIMI , Diakonhjemmet Hospital , Oslo April 2005 till October 2007 . Inclusion Criteria : Patients 40 80 year old uni- bilateral hip disability eligible hip surgery recruit Orthopaedic Centre , Ullevål University Hospital , NIMI , Diakonhjemmets Sykehus ( Hospital ) , Oslo . Inclusion criteria subject : - Harris Hip Score ( 35 ) 60 95 , hip pain 3 month . - Radiographic verified hip OA , classify orthopaedic surgeon ( LN ) , accord Danielsson 's criterion radiographic hip OA . Exclusion Criteria : Patients exclude history resent trauma functional impairment low limb disease might interfere participation ( rheumatoid arthritis , cancer , osteoporosis , severe back pain , knee OA ) . Patients co-morbidities tolerate physical activity exclude . Interventions : The intervention describe registration concern short-term follow-up study ( 03a-2005-NAR ) . Outcome Measurements : The primary end point Aim 1 3 WOMAC ( hip function ) , primary endpoint Aim 2 radiographic change use Danielsson 's criterion minimal joint space . Pain Functional Activity : The primary ( main ) outcome measurement self-reported functional outcome measure , disease-specific questionnaire Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) . WOMAC find valid , reliable responsive outcome measure patient hip OA . The self-reported Physical Activity Score Elderly ( PASE ) use record individual activity level prior inclusion follow-up interval . Hip pain record visual analogue scale ( VAS ) rating 0 100 mm ; 0 represent `` pain '' 100 represent `` much pain he/she possibly imagine '' . The pain record 6 minute walk test ( se ) . Six minute walk test ( Enright , 2003 ) : Observed functional capacity cardiovascular fitness assess six minute walk test . This test reliability estimate old adult validate old adult individual total hip arthroplasty . Health related quality life pain management : Quality life assess use self-administered generic questionnaire 36-item short-form health survey ( SF-36 ) version 2 . Muscle strength : Isokinetic muscle strength test Technogym REV 9000 ( Gambettola , Italia ) measure peak torque 60°s-1 hip flexion/extension , knee flexion/extension ankle flexion/extension . Cardiovascular Fitness ( Åstrand &amp; Rodahl , 1986 ) : Tested sub-maximal bicycle ergometer test accord method describe Åstrand &amp; Rodahl . The load adjust subject . Results correct age gender express ml O2 / kg / min . Range motion : Measured plastic goniometer . Flexion , abduction , adduction register supine position , fixation contralateral leg . Internal external rotation register prone position fixation buttock . Extension register accord Thomas test . Radiographic examination : Hip X-rays take inclusion 2 year follow-up , classify orthopaedic surgeon ( LN ) , accord Danielsson 's criterion radiographic hip OA . Data Collections Follow-Up : Data collect inclusion , 12 week intervention period , follow-ups 6 month , 1 year 2 year . Data outcome measurement collect patient follow-up , except 1 year follow-up , questionnaire include . Radiographic examination include inclusion 2 year follow-up . Power Calculations : The WOMAC Index main outcome measurement . Power calculation base standard deviation 23 mm , minimum clinically important difference 15 mm group calculate need 49 patient group . To account drop-outs , total 109 patient include RCT . Blinding : Personnel responsible intervention involve data collection . Physical therapist collect data blind patient ' group allocation . A research coordinate person , involve part study intervention data collection , responsible randomization procedure ( give subject information group allocation ) Statistical Analysis : Data randomize control trial analyze accord intention treat principle additional analysis compliers adhere exercise protocol cut-off value 24 training session . Registration Complications , Drop-Outs Compliance : Complications drop-outs register person responsible data collection . There used intention treat analysis . Compliance patient education exercise protocol register physical therapist responsible treatment . Ethics : All patient control subject receive write oral information study sign inform consent inclusion . The project perform accord recommendation Helsinki Declaration . Approval obtain Regional Committee Medical Research Ethics .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Between 40 80 year old uni bilateral hip disability Harris Hip Score ( 36 ) 60 95 . Harris Hip score ( 0100 point ) widely use assessment hip function patient hip OA . Harris Hip Score 60 use regularly institution one criterion hip surgery ( arthroplasty ) . Patients include 3 month hip pain . Patients radiographic verified hip OA ( Danielson 's criterion radiographic OA : Danielsson 's criterion minimal joint space : &lt; 4 mm &lt; 70 year , &lt; 3 mm ≥ 70 year , 1 mm difference hip ) .
