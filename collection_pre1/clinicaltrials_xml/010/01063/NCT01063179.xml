	<brief_title>Velcade , Melphalan , Prednisone And Thalidomide Versus Velcade , Melphalan , Prednisone Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III study represent prospective randomize open label multicenter trial evaluate whether combination VELCADE , Melphalan , Prednisone Thalidomide ( V-MPT ) , induction treatment newly diagnose elderly MM patient , improve outcome compare combination VELCADE-MP . Subjects randomize 1:1 allocation : Arm A : 250 patient : V-MPT treatment Arm B : 250 patient : V-MP treatment Patients exclude randomization register Arm C. Patients randomize arm A ( Thalidomide base ) enrol sub-study DVT prophylaxis . Patients evaluate scheduled visit 3 study period : pre-treatment , treatment long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) . 1 . Pre-treatment period : Screening visit , perform study entry . After provide write informed consent participate study , patient evaluate study eligibility After registration subject randomize . 2 . Treatment period : Subjects Arm A receive : 1 . Induction therapy : nine 5-week course VELCADE/Melphalan/Prednisone/Thalidomide ( V-MPT ) 2 . Maintenance therapy : Thalidomide combination VELCADE Subjects Arm B receive : 1 . Induction therapy : nine 5-week course VELCADE/Melphalan/Prednisone ( V-MP ) 2 . No maintenance therapy schedule At end induction treatment time discontinuation study drug , patient attend study center visit every 6 8-week basis , development confirm Progressive Disease ( PD ) 3 . LTFU period : After development confirm PD patient follow survival every 3 month via telephone office visit .</detailed_description>
