	<brief_title>Low Glycemic Index Diet Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject randomize one 3-year treatment two-treatment parallel design . Treatments : 1. low glycemic index dietary advice ( e.g . eat intact grain cereal , parboil rice , crack wheat , pasta , pea , bean , lentil , bake good make legume flour ) ; 2. high cereal fiber diet emphasize whole grain . Duration : The study consist approximately two month recruitment patient selection , time estimation individual caloric requirement assess , 3 year treatment period assign . Study Details : Fasting blood sample obtain screening , week -2 , month 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 27 , 30 , 33 36 study period . HbA1c assess visit . A carotid ultrasound ( CUS ) ( screen , month 0 , 12 36 ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( month 0 , 12 36 ) technology use assess arterial wall thickening change nature carotid plaque . Twenty-four hour urine urinary C-peptide analysis obtain immediately prior begin study end 3 year treatment phase . At end 3 year treatment period , subject wish undertake alternate treatment give appropriate instruction .</detailed_description>
