	<detailed_description>In oncology , clinical experience RAD001 base number phase I II study single agent RAD001 well phase Ib II study RAD001 combination chemotherapeutic molecular target agent , include paclitaxel , gemcitabine , erlotinib among others . More recently , phase III trial single agent RAD001 patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma fail therapy VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor complete . Clinical experience indication oncology come single dose study healthy volunteer , study solid organ transplant patient , RAD001 administer immunosuppressive agent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC type Disease stage . Patients unresectable stage II , stage III , Mx eligible . This include patient consider surgical candidate induction chemoradiation . Patients Mx M1 disease whose lifespan prognosis felt dominated locoregional disease chest candidate chemoradiotherapy also eligible . Patients pleural effusion transudative , cytologically negative non bloody eligible radiation oncologist feel tumor encompass within reasonable field radiotherapy . If pleural effusion small size thoracentesis possible , patient eligible Patients malignant pleural pericardial effusion eligible Patients eligible without measurable evaluable disease . Patients measurable evaluable disease evaluate criterion measurable disease Measurable disease define accord RECIST criterion Evaluable disease define lesion apparent CT fit criterion measurability . Ill define mass associate post obstructive change Mediastinal hilar adenopathy measurable one dimension Age ≥ 18 year ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Life expectancy &gt; 6 month Adequate lung function define 02 saturation ≥ 90 % room air Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN , ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) , INR PTT ≤1.5 . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose LMW heparin &gt; 2 week time randomization . ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Informed consent must obtain patient prior begin therapy . Patients ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Radiation therapy requirement : Patient must complete treatment plan approve protocol review team Patients receive prior radiation chemotherapy current diagnosis NSCLC ( patient receive surgery prior NSCLC eligible current diagnosis felt represent new primary , PFT 's would allow concurrent chemoradiation ) Patients , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , breast DCIS , may include diagnosis within 3 year . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis A known history HIV seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleeding diathesis</criteria>
