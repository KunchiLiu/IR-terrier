	<brief_summary>There two type external radiation treatment ( proton beam photon beam ) . As part participant 's treatment , receive radiation entire central nervous system ( CNS ) ; know craniospinal irradiation ( CSI ) . In past , photon radiation therapy use CSI . In study examine effect proton beam radiation therapy . Studies suggest kind radiation cause less damage normal tissue photon radiation therapy . The physical characteristic proton beam radiation let doctor safely deliver amount radiation deliver tumor normally deliver standard therapy spare normal tissue process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Before begin radiation therapy , participant scan do order prepare radiation treatment . Doctors use information gather scan plan best way deliver radiation tumor . - The following procedure perform either radiotherapy : Hearing exam ; neurocognitive exam ; blood test cerebral spinal fluid test . - Not everyone participates study receive amount proton radiation therapy . The length time amount radiation receive depend upon condition participant 's disease . Radiation treatment give day , 5 day week ( Monday-Friday ) . The overall treatment course approximately 6 week .</detailed_description>
