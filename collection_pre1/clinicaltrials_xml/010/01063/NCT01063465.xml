	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure mechanical property heal Achilles tendon human early control weightbearing , compare control group randomize , single-blinded trial . The mechanical property measure use radiostereophotogrammetic x-ray ( RSA ) . Hypothesis : Early weightbearing improve mechanical property heal Achilles tendon .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Mechanical Properties Healing Achilles Tendon With Without Early Weightbearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient acute Achilles tendon rupture come local emergency room ask participate study . Patients 18 60 year must contraindications surgical treatment . Patients interested participate study receive oral write information study main investigator study ( Thorsten Schepull ) . Patients agree participate study register surgery . All patient operate way local anaesthesia within 5 day injury . We go use conventional open technique dorso-medial approach . Tendon end go adapt resorbable suture go implant 2 Tantalum bead ( size 0.8 mm ) distal part tendon 2 Tantalum bead size proximal part . A short leg cast go applied foot equinus position . Randomization early weightbearing control group do postoperatively Group 1 ( control group ) : The short leg cast go applied operation foot equinus position remove 3.5 week new cast apply ankle neutral position another 3.5 week . The new cast remove 3.5 week ( cast treatment total 7 week ) . Physiotherapy start cast removal , follow previous hospital routine . Full activity , include sport , allow approximately 5 month . We go perform RSA 7 week ( within 15 minute cast removal ) , 19 week i.e . 12 week cast removal , 52 week ( 12 month ) . A certain frame use allow u apply pedal forefoot load weight . The first force apply pedal 25 N second 150 N. The day CT scan injured Achilles tendon take . Group 2 ( early weightbearing ) : The cast surgery remove 2 week replace removable Air Cast Walker . The patient provide special training pedal pedal resistance increase treatment period . The patient use Air Cast Walker 5 week ( cast treatment total 7 week ) , suppose remove cast twice day suppose use training pedal . Follow-ups 7 ( cast removal ) , 19 52 week use RSA CT perform group 1 .</detailed_description>
