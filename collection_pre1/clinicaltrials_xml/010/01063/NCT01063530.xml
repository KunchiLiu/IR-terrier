	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : The purpose study confirm clinical effectiveness safety topical diammine silver fluoride ( DASF ) tooth desensitizer adult compare application sterile water . Design : This blind , randomize clinical trial two group . The study 1 week duration . Study Sites : The study conduct two different site Peru ( Cayetano University Universidad Andina del Cusco ) . Cayetano University major private university South America . It recipient Fogerty International Center fund NIH history successful collaboration US university , include University Washington . Dr. Castillo , principal investigator , receive training orthodontics University Washington familiar US clinical trial procedure . Subjects : Participants 144 adult ( 18 50 year ) . Males female include . Each site ( Cayetano Cusco ) recruit 72 subject . Inclusion Criteria : To include subject must least one vital maxillary mandibular cuspid premolar cervical defect buccal surface clinical hypersensitivity response air score less 15 VAS pain ( describe ) . The individual generally healthy gum tissue surround tooth ulceration , leukoplakia ( white change ) gingival tissue . Exclusion Criteria : Excluded subject use type commercially available tooth desensitizer , receive fluoride varnish treatment within last month , take prescription medication kind , take aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug habitually , woman pregnant . Individuals use smokeless tobacco exclude . Individuals know sensitivity silver heavy-metal ion exclude . Subject Recruitment : Subjects recruit patient population Cayetano University School Dentistry Universidad Andina del Cusco School Dentistry . Subjects offer small financial incentive participation , pay $ 10 US second visit ( 24 hour ) $ 20 US 1-week check . Protection Human Subjects : The Institutional Review Board Cayetano University review protocol , inform consent participant obtain . The Cayetano IRB familiar US procedure NIH level work conduct . Treatment Conditions : Subjects randomly assign topical application DASF sterile water . The randomization stratify study site baseline sensitivity score 5-second blast pressurize air 2 cm distance tooth ( see description measure ) . Odor threat blind smell detectable clinically use small quantity . Taste threat study mg amount material apply , tooth air-dried application . The random treatment assignment generate project statistician . The randomization two treatment do stratification study site baseline pain score ( &lt; 37 ≥37 ) , block ensure two treatment group balance across study period within stratum . The stratification 37 chosen literature ( Ritter et al. , 2006 , paper append ) ensure balance . A pretest VAS 10 pretest subject Peru confirm mean response range . Block size equal 2 4 , choose randomly 2/3 1/3 probability , respectively . The randomization list prepare use `` sample '' function R statistical software ( Version 2.7.1 , The R Foundation Statistical Computing , 2008 ) . The assignment record slip paper number consecutively within stratum place inside seal envelope sequentially number stratum . The statistician retain master list , code break data analyze . The clinician open envelope apply agent . The agent ( active control ) package identical bottle label A B . The packaging do investigational pharmacy Cayetano University . Diammine silver fluoride ( Saforide , Toyo Seiyaku Kasei Co. Ltd. Osaka , Japan ) use . Saforide clear colorless liquid weak odor ammonia . It solution diammine silver fluoride [ Ag ( NH3 ) 2F ] . It include le 24.4w/v % 26.8 w/v % silver ( Ag ) , less 5.0 w/v % 5.9 w/v % fluorine ( F ) . Measures : Primary Outcome-Clinical Reduction pain ( sensitivity ) —The teeth isolated cotton gauze , subject report tooth pain 100-mm VAS ( Ritter et al. , 2006 , paper append ) treatment treatment 5-second blast pressurize air 2 cm distance tooth . The VAS anchor `` pain '' `` intolerable pain . '' The follow-up test repeat 24 hour 1 week later . The assessment conduct Spanish ( form append ) . We pretested scale sure descriptor translate properly . The term `` sensitivity , '' `` dentin sensitivity '' `` pain '' use interchangeably literature . For subject multiple test teeth , VAS score average produce one score per subject time point . The primary end-point 1 week treatment . The study test application diammine silver fluoride single visit previous work show single application physically block dentinal tubule additional application necessary , sensitivity reduce significantly . The clinical procedure disposable microbrush dip small drop diammine silver fluoride control apply surface 1 second , do clinically . Then surface gently air-dried procedure repeat . Safety Damage Gingiva—Tissues photograph application agent establish normal baseline condition . Gingival tissue surround tooth treat examine clinically immediately treatment , 24 hour one week later . A photograph assignment envelope ID take time sure photo properly account . The primary safety measure erythema . It assess visually without magnification use standard dental light . Erythema ( red change ) rat 1 3 scale , 1 redness 3 severe change . For subject one test tooth , score average test teeth . The Gingival Index ( Löe,1967 ) also use measure gingival inflammation . White change , ulceration , stain secondary measure . White change rat present absent . Ulceration rat present absent . Staining ( localize argyria ) cervical gingival tissue rat present absent . The perioral area also assess argyria , present absent . Quality Assurance : There two examiner ( Drs . Roccio Lazio Shirley Rivera , role aspect study blind study aim group assignment . The examiner train clinically assess sensitivity safety assessment , use standard photograph . As part training examiner rate 10 patient part randomize study , intraclass correlation ( ICC ) calculate . Each examiner test patient . Each examiner rate gingival tissue erythema , white change , ulceration staining also take clinical photograph gingival tissue examination . Training rating erythema : Trainees view standard photograph show redness , redness , severe redness . They examine rate 10 training patient independently , choose represent range severity . They allow refer standard photo rating . The intraclass correlation calculate two examiner . Examiners train achieve agreement ICC=0.8 well Training Gingival Index : Examiners instruct clinically GI . Then assess bleed around premolar 5 patient choose randomly 10 assessed . Scores calculate Wkappa calculate two examiner . Examiners train achieve agreement ICC=0.8 well An independent examiner , Dr. Tar Chee Aw , blind study condition , separately rate post-treatment photograph gingival tissue erythema , white change , ulceration stain manner clinical examiner without access earlier rating . The photograph mask avoid bias tooth staining presented examiner random order . The intraclass correlation ( ICC ) ass between-examiner reliability calculate . Case-report form develop local staff train use . Original form photograph kept site notebook , store locked cabinet , readily available audit . All entry black ink , sign date . Copies make send data coordinate center University Washington entry analysis . Clinical Procedure : All tooth surface meet entry criterion treat individual 's mouth limit 3 surface per patient . All surface individual receive treatment . The surface isolated cotton roll gently dry cotton gauze . A disposable dental microbrush ( Kerr Quiktips ) dip small drop diammine silver fluoride water apply surface 1 second , do clinically . Then surface gently air-dried . Then procedure repeat . At point two examiner , blind aim study treatment condition , begin assessment sensitivity safety . The follow-up assessment conduct 24 hour 1 week . Analysis : The data two site analyze separately demonstrate treatment effect tooth pain . To confirm reduction pain ( sensitivity , clinical indication ) , average difference score pretreatment post- treatment VAS score individual calculate time point ( immediately treatment , 24 hour 1 week treatment ) t-tests use compare change . The primary end point 1 week . GEE linear regression use secondary analysis compare reduction pain across three time point , outcome sensitivity three time point , baseline pain covariate , robust standard error use account multiple observation per subject . In addition , separate analysis covariance do time point compare reduction pain due active treatment two study site , outcome pain particular time point , baseline pain enter covariate , treatment site , well treatment group site interaction , enter factor . Fisher 's Exact Test use assess whether subject erythema score &gt; 1 diammine silver fluoride group versus control group . ( The test conduct separately time period , immediately treatment , 24 hour 1 week . ) Initially test conduct separately site , combine site increase statistical power detect difference safety measure . The primary end point assess 24 hour . A t-test test ass difference Gingival Index . Any white change , ulceration staining ( argyria ) report . Power Analysis : The data two site analyze separately , power describe separate site analysis . Reduction Tooth Sensitivity ( clinical indication ) : The primary end point assess 7 day post-treatment . In similar desensitization study compare several device include predicate device ( Ritter et al. , 2006 , paper append ) pain air-blast report Duraphat drop 36.9 ( SD=26.2 ) baseline 20.8 ( SD=4.3 ) 24 week post-treatment . We expect similar much large drop 7 day DASF , base unpublished work University Hong Kong ( data append ) little drop application sterile water . The Hong Kong data suggest achieve much great reduction tooth sensitivity observe Ritter study . Thus sample size 31 group allow detection effect size 0.64 ( calculate Duraphat work ) upwards alpha 0.05 power 0.8 ( one-sided test , online calculator : http : //www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calc47.aspx ) . To increase statistical power detect small difference , outcome data also analyze site combine . We expect ( least low ) attrition short time period study , account possible attrition , sample size inflate 144 72 per site . Based Fisher 's Exact Test separate analysis site 25 subject per group power 86 % detect difference proportion subject gingival inflammation score &gt; 1 10 25 ( 40 % ) versus 1 25 ( 4 % ) 85 % detect difference 8 25 ( 32 % ) versus 0 25 ( 0 % ) . To increase statistical power detect small difference , safety outcome also analyze site combine . Based Fisher 's Exact Test 50 subject per group power 84 % detect difference 9 50 ( 18 % ) versus 1 50 ( 2 % ) 80 % detect difference 4 50 ( 8 % ) versus 0 50 ( 0 % ) ( Bertil Olofosson , StudySize , Version 2.0.4 , CreoStat HB , 2007 ) . Note : recent study report gingival inflammatory change , expect see .</detailed_description>
