	<detailed_description>Premature ejaculation ( PE ) erectile dysfunction ( ED ) form sexual dysfunction men . An objective measurement PE clinical study intravaginal ejaculatory latency time ( IELT ) , time take man ejaculate sexual intercourse ( measure stopwatch ) . This multicenter , double-blind ( neither physician study participant know identity treatment assign ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) efficacy safety study dapoxetine compare placebo ( sugar pill ) men premature ejaculation currently treat ED phosphodiesterase 5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor sildenafil , vardenafil , tadalafil . A maximum 656 men 18 year old ( hereafter refer study participant ) receive treatment PDE-5 inhibitor least 3 month prior study entry enrol . The study last approximately 18 week include 4-week screening period , 12-week treatment period , follow-up telephone contact approximately 2 week end treatment . Both study participant partner require attend screen visit sign inform consent form document understand agree requirement study . After initial screening procedure complete , study participant qualify study enter 4-week screening period . During 4 week , study participant partner provide stopwatch time record IELT attempt sexual intercourse . At next scheduled clinic visit Day 1 double-blind treatment period , study participant continue qualify study assign chance ( like flip coin ) receive 1 2 study treatment ( dapoxetine placebo ) 12 week addition prescribe treatment PDE-5 inhibitor . Study participant instruct take study drug without food least 1 full glass water approximately 1 3 hour sexual activity ( 1 dose take within 24-hour period ) . During 12-week treatment period , study participant partner ask time record IELT attempt sexual intercourse Treatment Event Logs provide . Study participant return clinic 4 , 8 12 week treatment routine safety assessment ( include review Treatment Event Logs return ) dispense study drug . Following 12 week treatment ( time early withdrawal study ) end-of-treatment safety efficacy evaluation perform final clinic visit . Approximately 2 week later , follow telephone call make study participant collect information adverse event may occur concomitant therapy receive since time last clinic visit . The primary outcome measure study average IELT , measure stopwatch , sexual intercourse end treatment period ( Week 12 ) . Safety monitor study evaluate adverse event , physical examination finding , result clinical laboratory test , concomitant medication usage . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) establish monitor safety efficacy study participant study . In addition , interim ( preliminary ) analysis perform study monitor safety efficacy approximately 268 men complete 12 week treatment ( also include study participant complete treatment withdraw early study ) . Study participant receive either dapoxetine match placebo tablet dose 30 mg prn ( need ) take orally ( mouth ) without food least 1 full glass water approximately 1 3 hour sexual activity ( take every 24 hour ) . At Weeks 4 8 , dose dapoxetine match placebo may increase maximum 60 mg prn specific predefined criterion meet subsequently decrease 60 30 mg Weeks 4 8 .</detailed_description>
