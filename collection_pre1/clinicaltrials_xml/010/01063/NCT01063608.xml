Moreover , may help answer question relate use vaccine influenza virus variant emerge French population : 1 . Before vaccination : - What status residual anti-H1N1 seasonal virus immunity anti-A ( H1N1 ) v immunity population stratify age take account multiplicity prior seasonal vaccination ? - What level cellular humoral cross-reactivity different H1N1 strain ? 2 . After vaccination : - What intensity anti-vaccine immune response function age population ad prior seasonal vaccination ? - What level cellular humoral cross-reactivity vaccination function age population multiplicity prior seasonal vaccination ?</brief_summary>
