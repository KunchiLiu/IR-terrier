	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer major health problem Chinese woman . It estimate nearly 100,000 new cervical cancer case occur China every year , account 20 percent global new case . Surgery radiotherapy two major radical treatment method IB-IIB cervical cancer . Unlike United States country , operable woman IB-IIB cervical cancer receive radical surgery radiotherapy China . Patients recurrence risk factor ( lymph node metastasis , deep stromal invasion , positive lymphatic vascular space , et al . ) also receive adjuvant therapy surgery , radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy recommend NCCN guideline . However , China substantial part patient especially admit tertiary hospital receive several course chemotherapy instead radiotherapy recurrence risk factor . In previous study , find patient intermediate risk factor ( deep stromal invasion , positive lymphatic vascular space , bulky tumor &gt; 4cm ) good disease-free survival recurrence-free survival receive chemotherapy compare radiotherapy . The objective study investigate whether advantage postoperative chemotherapy result circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) patient intermediate risk factor .</brief_summary>
