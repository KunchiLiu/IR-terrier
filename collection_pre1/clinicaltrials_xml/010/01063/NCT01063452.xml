	<brief_title>Impact Atkinson Product Design Urinary Slide Valve Versus Standard Catheter Drainage System Social Functioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several indication exist urologic practice urinary drainage via urethral catheter require estimate 4 million patient United States undergo urinary catheterization per year . ( 1 ) Though common urine continually collect bag attach catheter plastic tubing , catheter valve offer alternative method store void urine . Catheter valves small device fit external end urethral catheter . Rather continuous drainage , urine store bladder empty regular interval open valve . This method drainage may offer several benefit include preserve bladder capacity , function tone , reduce catheter blockage case urine bacterial colonization , decrease traction force bladder neck remove downward weight collect bag . ( 2-4 ) The use catheter valve may offer improvement social functioning mobility . ( 5 ) Studies date suggest catheter valve well tolerated patient , study use non-standardized questionnaire assess overall quality life . ( 5 , 6 ) Additionally , may associate cost benefit utilizing catheter valve compare drainage bag . ( 5 ) Further study area , focus quality life social functioning , enable clinician good counsel patient risk benefit various method urinary drainage .</detailed_description>
