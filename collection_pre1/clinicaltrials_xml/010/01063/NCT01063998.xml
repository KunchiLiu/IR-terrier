	<brief_title>A Urinary Tumor Marker ( Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ) Detection Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States 38,900 case 12,840 death renal cell carcinoma 2006 . Renal cell carcinoma represent 2 % cancer worldwide . The majority kidney tumor discover incidentally investigation unrelated complaint . However , nearly 30 % patient present metastatic disease time diagnosis 30-40 % patient clinically localized kidney cancer recurrence . The diagnosis monitoring kidney cancer require expensive frequent imaging examination . There significant need find diagnostic prognostic biomarkers screen , diagnose , monitor renal cancer . A reliable urinary assay kidney cancer would major implication tumor screen high risk patient , selection patient adjuvant therapy , surveillance prognosis possibly surrogate marker response therapy . Human kidney injury molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) find sensitive specific biomarker identify kidney injury . The urine level KIM-1 increase patient kidney failure major type kidney tumor . The purpose study investigate urine KIM-1 routine blood marker renal failure ( creatinine ) distinguish kidney tumor non-tumor kidney injury . The ultimate goal project develop simple non-invasive method screen patient potential kidney tumor .</detailed_description>
