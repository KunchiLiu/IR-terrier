	<brief_title>A Long-term Safety Study With Tapentadol ER Oxycodone CR Patients With Moderate Severe Pain Due Chronic , Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy ( DPN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , active-controlled , multicenter study evaluate safety profile orally administer tapentadol , use extended release tamper-resistant formulation ( TRF ) , dosages 100 250 mg twice daily patient moderate severe pain due chronic , painful DPN . The study consist 1 ) 13-day screening period , 3-7-day washout period ( patient stop take pain medication ) , 1-day pretitration pain-intensity evaluation period ( patient record 24-hour pain intensity ) , 3-week , open-label titration period ( patient receive either tapentadol ER oxycodone CR study drug 3 1 ratio ) , 2 ) 49-week , open-label maintenance phase , 3 ) posttreatment phase approximately 10 14 day . The study evaluate safety tolerability orally administer tapentadol ER vital sign , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , opioid withdrawal scale , assessment patient-reported constipation , standardize neurologic examination monitor adverse event . Assessments pain relief include pain intensity numerical rating scale , patient global impression change scale ( PGIC ) . The total duration study drug treatment patient approximately 52 week . Titrate tapentadol ER 50 mg twice daily oxycodone CR 10 mg twice daily patient 's optimal dose range 100 mg 250 mg twice daily 20 50 mg twice daily , respectively . All dos study medication take orally without food maximum timeframe 52 week .</detailed_description>
