	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect treatment NAC , compare treatment placebo , cue- methamphetamine ( MA ) -induced crave MA subjective effect non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human volunteer . We also aim determine effect treatment NAC , compare treatment placebo , reinforce effect MA measure MA self-administration non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAC Potential Treatment Methamphetamine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>N-acetyl-l-cysteine ( NAC ) treatment associate reduced susceptibility reinstatement cocaine seek behavior rat ( Baker et al 2002 ) reduce cue-induced crave cocaine-dependent human volunteer ( LaRowe et al 2006 ) . We propose aim evaluate potential NAC treatment methamphetamine ( MA ) dependence : Specific Aim 1 : To determine effect treatment NAC ( placebo , 1800 3600mg daily ) , compare treatment placebo , cue- MA-induced craving MA subjective effect non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human volunteer . We hypothesize treatment NAC reduce crave MA report following exposure MA cue reduce crave MA subjective effect report follow non-contingent administration MA ( 0mg,9mg , 30 mg , IV ) . Specific Aim 2 : To determine effect treatment NAC ( placebo , 1800 3600mg daily ) , compare treatment placebo , reinforce effect MA measure MA self-administration non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human volunteer . We hypothesize treatment NAC reduce number choice make MA choice session .</detailed_description>

Have hematology chemistry laboratory test within normal ( +/ 10 % ) limit follow exception : ) liver function test ( total bilirubin , ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase ) &lt; 3 x upper limit normal , b ) kidney function test ( creatinine BUN ) &lt; 2 x upper limit normal . Have baseline ECG demonstrate normal sinus rhythm , normal conduction , clinically significant arrhythmia . Have medical history brief physical examination demonstrate clinically significant contraindication study participation , judgment admit physician principal investigator . Adult ADHD allowable , long symptom interfere participation . Have previous medically adverse reaction MA , include loss consciousness , chest pain , epileptic seizure . Have neurological psychiatric disorder , : a. episode major depression within past 2 year assess MINI ; b. lifetime history schizophrenia , psychotic illness , bipolar illness assess MINI ; c. current organic brain disease dementia assess clinical interview ; d. history current psychiatric disorder would require ongoing treatment would make study compliance difficult ; e. history suicide attempt within past year and/or current suicidal ideation/plan . f. history psychosis occur absence current MA use . Meet DSMIV criterion abuse dependence alcohol drug , except nicotine . Meet DSMIV criterion dependence marijuana . Have evidence clinically significant heart disease hypertension , determine PI . Have evidence untreated unstable medical illness include : neuroendocrine , autoimmune , renal , hepatic , active infectious disease . Have HIV currently symptomatic , diagnosis AIDS , receive antiretroviral medication . Be pregnant nursing . Other female must either unable conceive ( i.e. , surgically sterilize , sterile , postmenopausal ) use reliable form contraception ( e.g. , abstinence , birth control pill , intrauterine device , condom , spermicide ) . All female must provide negative pregnancy urine test study entry , upon hospital admission , end study participation . Currently use alpha beta agonist , theophylline , sympathomimetics . Have illness , condition , use medication , opinion P.I . and/or admit physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion study . Have sulfur allergy . Criteria Discontinuation Following Initiation : Participants discharge positive urine toxicology breath test indicate illicit use drug Research Commons , comply study procedure , tolerate MA . MA administer participant continue meet inclusion criterion list study physician believe may reason withhold MA . Rationale Subject Selection Criteria : Participants require used MA intravenous route order avoid expose participant new route administration . Participants asthma take medication asthma exclude due potential adverse interaction treatment medication MA . Participants use alcohol heavily exclude due potential withdrawal symptom hospital . Participants active HIV disease exclude avoid potentially exacerbate underlie illness .</criteria>
