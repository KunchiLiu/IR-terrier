	<brief_summary>The goal research assess percentage non-responders ≥ 2 NSAIDs candidate biological therapy could adequately respond treatment etoricoxib This study confirm result previous study wider similar population . Basing previous result , response rate assess ASASBIO criterion . The efficacy treatment etoricoxib 90 mg assess week 4 population patient AS n't respond adequately previous therapy ≥ 2 NSAIDs . Those patient , base ASABIO criterion , achieve sufficient clinical response follow week 24 ass maintenance study drug effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Response Etoricoxib Patients With Ankylosing Spondylitis Inadequate Response ≥2 NSAIDs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Etoricoxib oral , selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor approve symptomatic treatment ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) Spain . Etoricoxib market product indicated relief symptomatic osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis , pain sign inflammation associate acute gouty arthritis . In ankylose spondylitis , recommend dose 90 mg daily . Clinical pharmacology study demonstrate Etoricoxib induce dose-dependent inhibition COX-2 without inhibit COX-1 , 150 mg daily dose . Etoricoxib inhibit gastric synthesis prostaglandin effect platelet function . Cyclooxygenase responsible prostaglandin synthesis . Were identify two different isoforms cyclooxygenase , COX-1 COX-2 . It show COX-2 major enzyme responsible synthesis prostanoid mediator involve pain , inflammation fever .</detailed_description>
