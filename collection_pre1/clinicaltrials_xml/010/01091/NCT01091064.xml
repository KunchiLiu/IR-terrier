The majority patient present mild symptom treat safely home parent . Every year October thru April emergency department North America overwhelm patient wait see mild respiratory infection , bronchiolitis .

	<brief_title>Impact Of A Health Care Protocol For Patients Suffering Symptoms Of Mild Acute Viral Bronchiolitis On Early Release In The Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute viral bronchiolitis constitutes principal cause acute low respiratory tract infection infant child Nord America . Every year 11 % infant young 1 year 6 % 1 2 year affect . Acute viral bronchiolitis characterize first episode respiratory distress associate rhinorrhea , cough fever , symptom vomit , use accessory intercostal muscle irritability present . Mild symptoms presentation bronchiolitis common , patient require treatment testing , appropriate information ameliorate respiratory symptom well list alarm sign parent frequently enough send patient home . Increasing workload ED national worry last 20 year . Between October April , phenomenon see year due cold influenza season . From economic perspective along lack human resource , new strategy implement reduce duration cost office visit emergency department . Since mild bronchiolitis require specific treatment , hypothesize patient liberated triage mild acute viral bronchiolitis would rate office re-visits mild acute bronchiolitis emergency department . Our principal objective compare group infant mild acute viral bronchiolitis use hospital resource within fist 15 day recruitment . Specific objective compare 2 group rate office re-visit , ED fist 15 day recruitment , severity respiratory symptom re-visits , follow 2-4 day , 6-8 day 13-15 day , patient parent satisfaction first visit follow 2-4 day , 6-8 day 13-15 day . This research project rapid direct effect quality health care infant acute viral bronchiolitis parent , well important repercussion workload wait room EDs allow physician concentrate patient need rapid attention . This project carry two high concentration specialize hospital province Quebec , Canada .</detailed_description>
