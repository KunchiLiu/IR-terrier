	<brief_summary>The incidence distal radius fracture ( DRF ) increase age , thus , improve life expectancy , fracture set become common . Fractures distal radial metaphysis know strongly related osteoporosis , result , management distal radius fracture elderly patient beset difficulty . Recently , aggressive fracture fixation elderly become topic interest , hope increase rate recovery preserve ability live independently . Many elderly patient remain active well eighth ninth decade , example , pursue activity , , golf tennis , daily basis . The introduction volar lock plat system increase interest . This system , use fix angle principle , propose effective maintain good anatomic reduction , even elderly . However , still concern remain metaphyseal defect reduction osteoporotic DRF . Injectable calcium phosphate bone cement ( CPC ) use augment remain metaphyseal defect fracture reduction include DRF , specially osteoporotic old patient . The purpose randomize , prospective study investigate additional CPC augmentation benefit volar lock plate fixation unstable DRF patient old 65 . The null hypothesis difference wrist functional outcome , radiographic outcome , complication treatment volar lock plate alone calcium phosphate bone cement well volar lock plate unstable DRF patient old 65 .</brief_summary>
