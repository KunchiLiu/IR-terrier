	<brief_summary>Background . Exercise intolerance one devastating consequence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Abnormalities peripheral muscle function weakness reduction oxidative enzyme activity commonly find patient may contribute exercise intolerance.To evaluate whether systemic weightlift exercise may improve exercise capacity well endurance training , combine training effective , investigator compare three different train regimen , endurance training alone , systemic weightlift train alone combination endurance weightlift training . Methods.36 patient stable COPD evaluate 4 month training program . Each evaluation include stepwise exercise test ergocycle individual maximal capacity minute ventilation ( VE ) , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production ( VCO2 ) , arterial lactic acid concentration measure peripheral muscle strength determine one repetition maximum eight different muscle group . Percutaneous needle muscle biopsy M.vastus lateralis perform training period order determine fiber-type proportion . Patients assign one follow three group ( 1 ) endurance training consist 20 min exercise session calibrate ergocycle two time week , target training intensity 60 % individual maximum oxygen uptake , ( 2 ) systemic weightlift training two time week eight different exercise , session consist 15 repetition muscle group , ( 3 ) combination endurance train systemic weightlift training . Statistical analysis . Baseline data patient enrol study compare one-way analysis variance three study group . Results train analyzed two- way analysis variance .</brief_summary>
