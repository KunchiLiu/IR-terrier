	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus leave cell liver bound type fat . An component grapefruit could block fat thus low amount virus blood stream . We propose treatment ingredient , call naringenin , could use block fat HCV person infect hepatitis C .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Grapefruit Flavonoid Naringenin HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hepatitis C virus actively secrete liver infected patient bound low density lipoprotein ( vLDL ) . The grapefruit flavonoid naringenin could use block vLDL secretion lower circulate viral titer . Hypothesis : Treatment naringenin block vLDL HCV secretion person infect HCV . Primary Objective To study safety pharmacokinetics single-dose naringenin Secondary Objectives 1 . To study change circulate HCV titer transition fast fed state . 2 . To study change circulate HCV titer administration grapefruit flavonoid naringenin . 3 . To study effect naringenin vLDL secretion . This single-arm , cross study placebo administer transition fast fed state , protocol repeat single dose naringenin plus cyclodextrin , use previous measurement his/her control</detailed_description>
