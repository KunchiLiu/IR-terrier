	<brief_title>Brostallicin Cisplatin Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify clinical efficacy brostallicin cisplatin treatment breast cancer patient triple negative ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] /progesterone receptor [ PR ] /HER2 negative ) phenotype , measure progression-free survival ( PFS ) 3 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe confirmed tumor response rate patient measurable disease receive brostallicin cisplatin . II . To describe duration response patient measurable disease receive brostallicin cisplatin . III . To describe 6-month progression-free survival patient receive brostallicin cisplatin . IV . To describe overall survival ( OS ) patient receive brostallicin cisplatin . V. To evaluate adverse event profile study regimen ( adverse event grade use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program [ CTEP ] Active Version Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 brostallicin IV 10 minute day 2 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
