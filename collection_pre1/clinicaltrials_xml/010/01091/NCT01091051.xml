	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Ustekinumab Patients With Palmo-Plantar Pustular Psoriasis With Palmo-Plantar Pustulosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patient active Palmo-Plantar Pustular Psoriasis ( cohort A ) twenty patient active Palmo-Plantar Pustulosis ( cohort B ) include placebo-controlled double-blind study.Patients cohort randomize ( 1:1 ) receive either ustekinumab S/C ( Sub-Cutaneous ) ( 45 mg patient weight 100 kg less , 90 mg patient weight 100 kg ) placebo . Patients randomized ustekinumab ( 10 PPPP 10 PPP ) receive ustekinumab Day 0 , Weeks 4 16 placebo Week 20 whereas patient randomize placebo ( 10 PPPP 10 PPP ) receive placebo Weeks 0 4 ustekinumab Weeks 16 20 . Patients see screen , Day 0 , Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 20 , 24 28 . The PPPASI ( Palmo-Plantar Pustular Area Severity Index ) , PPPGA ( Palmo-Plantar Physician Global Assessment ) , PPSA ( Palmo-Plantar Surface Area ) use evaluate severity DLQI ( Dermatology Life Quality Index ) , WPAI : PSO ( Work Productivity Activity Impairement Questionnaire : Psoriasis ) PPQoLI ( Palmo-Plantar Quality Life Index ) use evaluate quality life . Safety assess physical examination , evaluation adverse event laboratory analysis . High quality digital medical photograph palm sol take Day 0 , Weeks 4 , 16 28 . In addition , one optional skin biopsy palm sole perform Day 0 Week 16 pu collect pustule palm and/or sol Day 0 Week 16 . Finally , blood collect Day 0 genetic analysis every patient consent DNA blood sampling .</detailed_description>
