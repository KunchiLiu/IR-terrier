	<brief_title>Work Related Injuries Among Prehospital Emergency Medical Staff , Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Background : Staff emergency medical mission high risk work-related injury . Over 8 % emergency medical staff report victim work-related injury , leading time away work 9.4 % . Others report rate 5 - 25 accident per 100'000 flight hour 55 per 100'000 road ambulance transport . A ten year retrospective analysis US public roadway identify 331 accident 405 fatality 838 injury . Speed work , unknown work surroundings , difficult work condition poor light tight work environment may contribute injury . While mishap unintentional injury cause incident , frank assault pose additional threat medical staff . In US injury rate EMS worker higher rate report department labour industry . Most commonly reported injury include strain sprain , however , permanent disability fatal injury report . Even though medical profession 's first duty harm , innocent bystander repeatedly victim ambulance crash . In fact , one study report great burden injury person ambulance . While emergency medical work pose intrinsic risk patient worker , several risk factor identify associate increased risk incapacitate fatal injury , e.g. , position rear ambulance improper restrains , young EMS professional sleep problem non-emergency travel . Inadequate restrains pose particular risk paediatric emergency transport . No data work-related injury report prehospital medical crew Europe . Aims : The primary aim study assess incidence ( number new injury per 100'000 emergency mission per 1'000 fly hour ) type work related injury among prehospital emergency personal . The secondary aim identify risk factor associate work related injury compare risk injury group professional hospital nurse , policeman fire-fighters . Setting : Prehospital emergency medical service ( EMS ) Switzerland , include ground , air water-related ambulance service . All certify ambulance service air , traffic water accident eligible participation contact invited participate . Additional support rescue company rescue squad Swiss Alpine Club ski resort well lay rescuer include analysis . All accident medical mission prolong period analyse . Depending available data different ambulance service , study period may extend least one year maximum 10 year . Methods : Incidents define : - unintentional ( i.e . accident ) intentional ( i.e . assault ) injury emergency medical mission lead leave work , include : - EMS personal , - innocent bystander - additional injury patient transport ; - needle stick injury , even lead leave work ; - leave work due severe psychological distress emergency mission , e.g . death child Medical reason ( e.g . common flu , chronic back pain ) result leave work consider incident include . Severity injury stratify accord KABCO classification suggest previously ( K : kill , A : incapacitating injury , B : non-incapacitating injury , C : possible injury , O : apparent injury ) . Incidents analyse accord parameter related ambulance organisation , type emergency mission injury patient , EMS personal innocent bystander . Since prevalence accident near miss expect low , large number emergency mission large time span must investigate . To allow timely analysis , data gather retrospectively . The data victim ( case , i.e . ambulance worker ) collect anonymously . Cases identify use accident number ( Schadennummer ) UVG ( Unfallversicherungsgesetz ) insurer . Personal data thus anonymous study centre Bern . Data evaluation statistic : In first step total incidence work-related injury ( number new injury divide number mission divide number fly hour ) determine primary endpoint among street , air sea ambulance service Switzerland . Descriptive statistic use . Risk factor , i.e . secondary endpoint , analyze use univariable multivariable multilevel linear regression model three level : 1. ambulance organization , 2. ambulance mission 3. victim . Possible risk factor may include : - ambulance organization : - type ambulance organization , ( ground , air , sea ) - geographical region ambulance organization ( German , French , Italian-romansch speak region Switzerland ) - rural - urban set - hospital association ambulance service - number collaborator ambulance service - number mission per year - mission : - time day - weekday - time year - weather condition - duration mission - type accident ( unintentional accident , assault , psychological `` injury '' ) - phase mission ( approach , site accident , way hospital , hand-over / hospital ground , way home ) - type mission ( primary mission , i.e . direct approach accident , secondary mission ( interhospital transfer ) . - / without special signal , i.e . signal light - Victim associate : - Age time accident - gender - year job experience - role accident-related rescue mission ( driver , paramedic , pilot , … ) , position time accident ( driver compartment , patient compartment , … ) - part-time , fulltime employment - number mission per collaborator per year - patient characteristic ( patient transport suffer additional injury , patient escort e.g . parent child-patient , member rescue team , bystander ) - degree injury ( decease , permanent injury , non-permanent injury , possible injury , uninjured ) - duration leave work - position time accident ( driver compartment , patient compartment , outside vehicle , / vehicle ) - innocent bystander - patient transport In second step comparison professional group , e.g . hospital nurse , policeman fire-fighters perform . The data first step allow perform sample size calculation future research . Objective Aims : The primary aim study assess incidence ( number new injury per 100'000 emergency mission per 1'000 fly hour ) type work related injury among prehospital emergency personal . The secondary aim identify risk factor associate work related injury compare risk injury group professional hospital nurse , policeman fire-fighters . Methods Prehospital emergency medical service ( EMS ) Switzerland . All certify ambulance service air , traffic water accident eligible participation contact invited participate . All accident medical mission prolong period analyse . Incidents define : - unintentional ( i.e . accident ) intentional ( i.e . assault ) injury emergency medical mission lead leave work , include : - EMS personal , - innocent bystander - additional injury patient transport ; - needle stick injury , even lead leave work ; - leave work due severe psychological distress emergency mission</detailed_description>
