Using randomize , control intervention ton trial , propose study address three primary one secondary hypothesis : 1 ) A previously test validated exercise promotion intervention ( c.f. , Marcus et al. , 1998 ) successful help sedentary individual initiate maintain moderate intensity physical activity regimen , compare health wellness control intervention , 2 ) Increases positive attitude , perceive normative support , self-efficacy , intention exercise mediate effectiveness intervention , 3 ) That increase positive mood , good temperature , stress , lactate regulation immediately exercise challenge ( assessed laboratory ) moderate effectiveness intervention , 4 ) Secondarily , test whether gender , race/ethnicity , two recently suggest genetic factor ( BDNF OPRM1 ) moderate effectiveness intervention . The rigorous assessment exercise promotion intervention effective provide information future development intervention strategy content , well allow target exercise content individual likely effective .</brief_summary>
