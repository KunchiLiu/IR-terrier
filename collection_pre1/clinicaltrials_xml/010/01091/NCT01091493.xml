	<brief_summary>COPD one important cause morbidity mortality suppose sanitary problem Europe USA . Patients COPD usually 1-2 episode acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) per year , principal cause hospitalization , respiratory problem medical visit . After episode AECOPD , majority patient develop transitory ( permanent ) worsen quality life 50 % require new hospitalization . Globally , 75 % &amp; exacerbation might associate respiratory tract infection , among , 50 % might relate bacteria 45 % evidence viral infection could document . Even though antibiotic treatment might useful majority patient AECOPD , generalize use ( almost 85 % series ) hospitalize patient . The non-controlled use antibiotic AECOPD result expensive disease raise rate resistance bacteria . The available literature show 's relation exacerbation infection , base sputum sample . In summary , well know least 50 % episode AECOPD might associate pathogenic bacteria low respiratory tract . Prescription antibiotic wide generalize hospitalized patient . Clinical trial show correlation AECOPD sputum purulence ( correlate presence bacteria ) , however 've include NON-purulent AECOPD , even though 're significative group patient hospitalize cause . It 's necessary evaluate efficacy security antibiotic treatment group patient well design trial .</brief_summary>
