	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see GE reflux event associate increase level pepsin spit sample . Pepsin special protein call `` enzyme '' make stomach . It normally find throat . Pepsin break food protein eat form nutritional building block body use grow . An enzyme substance help break protein . Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) common infant child , result serious health problem accurately diagnose . The investigator currently definitive test use standard diagnose pediatric GERD . Measurement pepsin , enzyme normally produce stomach , use non-invasive way detect gastric aspiration ( reflux stomach fluid airway ) adult child , use pepsin detect reflux test . Since pepsin present normal esophagus respiratory tract , always present reflux fluid stomach , investigator believe GE reflux investigator detect , high level pepsin investigator see fluid collect mouth . If patient GE reflux , swallow problem alone food liquid go airway , investigator expect patient pepsin fluid collect mouth . The investigator test hypothesis measure pepsin level mouth fluid compare number GE reflux event investigator find use pH/impedance ( MII ( multichannel intraluminal impedance ) ) test . Since investigator interested pepsin level type reflux - acid non-acid -the investigator study child whether acid block medicine . The investigator also look pepsin level patient whose pH/MII normal , aspiration alone investigator find modified barium swallow ( MBS ) study . The investigator measure pepsin level healthy child reflux symptom swallow problem investigator control . The investigator anticipate study show positive correlation GE reflux event presence oropharyngeal pepsin , may allow u use pepsin way test reflux .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Pediatric patient birth 18 year ( include premature infant ) deem clinically require 24 hour esophageal pH/impedance . 2 . Pediatric patient ( newborn 18 year ) undergo MBS pH/MII monitoring within 6 month . 3 . Patients ' parent legal guardian provide write informed consent protocol . When appropriate , patient assent obtain . 1 . Patients anatomic facial anomaly facial discomfort preclude nasal intubation pH/MII catheter . 2 . Patient unable complete 24 hour pH/MII study . 3 .
