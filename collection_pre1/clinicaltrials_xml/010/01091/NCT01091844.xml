	<brief_title>Efficacy Retrograde Fill Vs Spontaneous Fill Assess Voiding Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects enrol study present UNC gynecology outpatient clinic surgical preoperative evaluation . After surgery , woman undergo void trial ass urinary retention surgery . This currently perform patient undergo surgery involve prolapse incontinence . At UNC usually perform allow bladder spontaneously fill , allow patient void afterward catheterize patient check postvoid residual ( `` spontaneous fill '' technique ) . In study , also assess bladder empty separately fill bladder retrograde catheter already place 300 mL saline remove catheter allow patient void ( `` retrograde-fill '' technique ) . We determine postvoid residual indirectly subtract void volume 300 mL infused volume . No catheterization perform technique . Both technique perform . The order two technique perform randomized . We compare outcomes two technique void trial see equivalent assess urinary retention . Of note , retrograde fill technique standard institution consider experimental .</detailed_description>
