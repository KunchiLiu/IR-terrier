	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Immunogenicity Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine ( LAIV ) Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomize , double-blind study design demonstrate immunologic noninferiority Q/LAIV compare FluMist child 2-17 year compare strain-specific post-dose geometric mean titer hemagglutination inhibition antibody . Children randomize 3:1:1 receive Q/LAIV one two FluMist vaccine . Subjects 9-17 year age receive single dose , 2-8 year age receive two dos one month apart . Serum obtain 1 month dose 1 except influenza vaccine-naive subject 2-8 year old , obtain dose 2 . Safety tolerability also assess .</detailed_description>
