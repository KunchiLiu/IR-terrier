	<brief_title>Irinotecan Bevacizumab Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accumulating data suggest angiogenesis play critical role formation development number solid tumor include ovarian cancer . For woman ovarian cancer , direct relationship vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression tumor vascularity document . In vivo vitro data demonstrate increased angiogenesis microvessel density negative prognostic factor woman ovarian cancer . These observation fuel interest incorporate anti-angiogenic agent ovarian cancer treatment regimens . Several phase II trial irinotecan patient epithelial ovarian cancer show drug efficacy chemotherapy-naïve patient previously treat standard therapy , include platinum-based compound , radiation , . Combination bevacizumab , antibody VEGF , irinotecan study colorectal cancer malignant brain neoplasm . In trial , combination show safe effective . The purpose study evaluate efficacy toxicity irinotecan treatment woman recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer primary peritoneal cancer combine bevacizumab . In phase II open-label study patient treat bevacizumab 15 mg/kg irinotecan 175mg/m^2 every 3 week . Patients undergo pre-treatment evaluation within 4 week enrol study . Clinical laboratory evaluation perform every 3 week . Imaging study CA-125 measurement use assess response treatment .</detailed_description>
