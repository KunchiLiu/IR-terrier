	<brief_summary>The incidence cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) rise significantly patient ' survival improves . Early diagnosis CFRD crucial prevent unnecessary deterioration lung function nutritional status , affect patient 's overall survival . The oral glucose tolerance test ( OGGT ) accept method detect CFRD . The Cystic Fibrosis Trust guideline ( 2004 ) recommend patient CF age twelve year screen annually . Most hospital use annual OGTT . Performing OGTT CF patient inconvenient may cost effective , patient starve overnight need spend extra 2 hour hospital addition annual review test . In centre , selective approach use . If patient abnormal random blood glucose /or abnormal glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and/or symptom hyperglycaemia unexplained weight loss OGTT perform . The aim study 1 . To compare clinical efficiency screen CFRD two different method : ) selective approach , ii ) unselected annual OGTT patient . 2 . To compare cost effectiveness two approach screen CFRD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CFRD affect 30 % patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) age twentyâˆ’five . Early diagnosis CFRD crucial prevent unnecessary deterioration pulmonary function nutritional status , affect patient 's overall survival . The selective approach take less patient time less expensive . If equally accurate use routinely . The oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) accept method detect CFRD Cystic Fibrosis Trust guideline recommend patient CF age twelve year screen annually . Yung et al , question approach argue perform OGTT CF patient inconvenient may cost effective , patient starve overnight need spend extra 2 hour hospital addition annual review test . In study , selective approach perform OGTTs screen CFRD use ; include use combination clinical biochemical criterion abnormal random blood glucose /or abnormal glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and/or symptom hyperglycaemia , weight loss .</detailed_description>
