	<brief_title>Investigation Safety HIV-1 Vaccine Given Intra-muscularly Intra-nasally Healthy Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current treatment HIV aim delay disease process body infect virus . HIV treatment prevent spread virus uninfected people . Prevention HIV infection could realize vaccine . An effective vaccine could slow world wide epidemic . None potential vaccine investigate past 20 year could provide protection HIV . All vaccine aim stimulate immune reaction blood . A new theory raise protection HIV take place site virus case enters body sexual contact , vagina rectum . Mymetics Corporation , sponsor clinical trial , develop new vaccine , base so-called virosome technique . This vaccine able induce local immune reaction mucosa vagina rectum . Investigations laboratory animal show newly develop vaccine safe well tolerated local immune reaction mucosa could establish . The next step investigate concept mucosal immunity also apply human . Therefore trial design investigate newly develop vaccine also safe well tolerate healthy subject . In addition , investigated vaccine induce immune response mucosa vagina rectum . The vaccine investigate first time man . The vaccine consist small part HIV 1 virus , couple carrier , virosome . The vaccine also contain two protein influenza virus . These need stability vaccine activation immune system general . There two group 12 healthy female subject . In total 24 subject participate study . The first group vaccinate low dose vaccine ( 10 microgram peptide ) . If vaccine assess safe safety review , second group vaccinate high dose vaccine ( 50 microgram peptide ) . Safety tolerability high dose also assess two safety review . Each subject vaccinate four occasion , separate eight week . The first two vaccination give muscle third fourth vaccination give nose order enhance immune response mucosa . In group , eight subject vaccinated real vaccine four subject vaccinate carrier ( placebo ) . Nor investigator neither subject know vaccination receive . It so-called double-blinded study . Safety tolerability assess local systemic adverse reaction . In addition , blood urine investigated subject physical examination include vital sign measurement . At home , subject complete diary card registration local systemic adverse event . The immune response blood measure . For investigation mucosal immune response , smear mucosa vagina rectum take investigated four visit . This perform special sponge painless procedure . Total duration study subject 32-34 week . HIV infection due vaccination possible .</detailed_description>
