	<brief_summary>The specific aim project determine impact daily intake one half ounce lyophilize meat 6-18 month age ( 0.5 oz 6-12 mo ; 0.75 oz 12-18 mo ) linear growth velocity , zinc iron intake status , brain growth neurocognitive development , infectious disease morbidity population traditionally dependent non-micronutrient fortify plant food complementary feeding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Bites : Complementary Feeding - A Global Network Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inadequate inappropriate complementary feed major factor contribute excess morbidity mortality young child . Prominent among nutrient inadequacy iron zinc . While huge campaign mount fortify complementary food distribute supplement , effectiveness program generally uncertain reach million rural poor . By comparison , little support give local food-based solution . These require diversity plant food appear require inclusion meat achieve zinc iron requirement . Local supply meat achievable concert international local effort . To justify effort require multi-site efficacy study , result , positive , leave doubt effort require provide sustainable local source meat complementary feed worthwhile . The principal hypothesis test daily intake beef ( 1 oz/d 6-12 mo 1.5 oz/d 12-18 mo ) add usual primarily plant-derived complementary feed plus select repetitive nutrition education message result great linear growth velocity micronutrient ( include Zn Fe ) fortify equi-caloric cereal/legume supplement plus educational message . Participants four site Global Network stunt rate &gt; 20 % , i.e . Guatemala , Pakistan Zambia randomize cluster receive either Â½ oz lyophilize beef ( equivalent 1 oz cook beef ) /d equi-caloric micronutrient-fortified plant-based supplement ( increase 50 % age 1 year ) . Both group receive three repetitive message deliver study coordinator local health system part integrate health care . These : provide thick puree/gruel ; fee complementary food least three time per day ; maximize dietary diversity . These intervention precede message promote exclusive breast feed 6 month start complementary feed promptly time far possible . The meat fortify cereal supplement provide daily group set cluster ; necessary food intervention message deliver home assign community coordinator alternate . Outcome measure , obtain separate group local , trained assessment worker , include : longitudinal linear growth 6-18 month ( primary outcome ) ; weight head circumference ; assessment dietary variety diversity 6,9,12 , 18 month ; index iron , zinc Vitamin B12 status 18 month ; neurocognitive development 18 month ; incidence diarrhea lower respiratory infection . A positive multi-country , multi-culture outcome trial demonstrate efficacy regular intake meat commence age 6 month achieve nutritionally complete complementary feeding provide strong rationale global effort enhance local supply meat achieve acceptance meat complementary food .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion cluster : Each cluster rural community characterize inhabitant low income serve one community health center . A primary criterion national available statistic indicate prevalence stunting ( mean length age Zscores second year &lt; 2 ) least 20 % young child . Inclusion criterion individual family : Infant age 34 month ; Primarily exclusively breast feeding intent continue breast feed least 1 year . Exclusion criterion individual family : Exclusion criterion include population/family receive likely receive free subsidize complementary food ( infant formula ) health system NGOs ; individual family feed intend feed fortify infant formula micronutrientfortified commercial complementary food . Exclusion criteria infant : Infants meet follow criterion exclude participation : 1. know congenital anomaly ; 2. infant multiple birth ; 3. know neurological deficit apparent time enrollment ( include seizure ) .</criteria>
