	<detailed_description>60 patient , 18 year old , diagnose newly symptomatic multiple myeloma ( standard diagnosis criterion ) renal failure , previously untreated chemotherapy , include . It multi centric , national open study design order determine efficacy combination bortezomib dexamethasone multiple myeloma patient renal failure . The trial consist two part : pre-treatment treatment . Pre- treatment phase : include enrolment visit order determine patient eligible participate study . The patient give Informed Consent Form order participate study , detailed information treatment , benefit risk . Treatment phase : include treatment consist , , 12 cycle Velcade Dexamethasone ( induction extension ) . During period , patient come centre study visit evaluate , day receive Velcade® cycle . Once clinical trial finish , patient monitor short long-term period progression free survival overall survival evaluate .</detailed_description>
