	<brief_summary>The objective study determine men evidence progressive prostate cancer chronic androgen ablation ≥ 1 year duration exhibit clinical response follow administration parenteral testosterone oral etoposide . Treatment Plan : Eligible patient continue androgen ablative therapy luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( i.e . Zoladex Lupron ) surgically castrate . Patients receive intramuscular injection testosterone cypionate dose 400 mg every month total 3 injection ( i.e . 3 month therapy ) . This dose select base data demonstrate produce initial supraphysiologic serum level testosterone ( i.e . &gt; 3-5 time normal level ) eugonadal level achieve end two week . Beginning day testosterone injection , patient also receive oral etoposide 100 mg/day divide dos ( 50 mg q 12h ) x 14 day 28 day per cycle . After 3 month therapy , patient repeat prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) bone/computed tomography ( CT ) scan establish effect combine testosterone etoposide treatment parameter ( i.e . `` testosterone effect baseline '' ) . Patients sustain elevation PSA ≥ 50 % pre-testosterone treatment PSA level initial three month testosterone etoposide therapy receive continue therapy come study . Patients PSA level less peak serum PSA level see three month period ( PSA decline ) patient PSA ≤ 50 % pretreatment baseline receive second 3 month course monthly testosterone etoposide therapy evidence disease progression . Disease progression define PSA increase PSA level obtain 3 month testosterone treatment two successive measurement 2 week apart evidence new lesion progression bone/CT scan compare baseline study . Patients respond initial treatment testosterone etoposide show sign progression option retreatment testosterone alone period 3 month great original therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Based preclinical data , high level androgen lead significant growth suppressive effect prostate cancer cell vitro vivo . Mechanistic data vitro model suggest growth suppression may due accumulation androgen induce TOP2B mediate double strand break AR target sit occur stimulation prostate cancer cell high level androgen . Provocatively , number double strand break significantly increase ( Figure 3 B ) cell treat etoposide , agent lead formation double strand break TOP2 target site , concurrently high-dose androgen stimulation . We hypothesize co-administration testosterone etoposide could produce high level double strand break prostate cancer cell , overwhelm DNA repair survival mechanism lead cancer cell death growth arrest . To test whether possibility hold promise therapy advanced prostate cancer , propose follow clinical trial parenteral testosterone therapy combination oral etoposide men evidence progressive prostate cancer chronic androgen ablation .</detailed_description>
