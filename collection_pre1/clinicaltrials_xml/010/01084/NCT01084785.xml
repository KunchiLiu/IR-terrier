	<detailed_description>It already know long time cancer genetic disorder development illness complex interaction genetic surround factor . Also response therapy development seriousness side effect stipulate complicated collaboration genetic surround factor . Moreover DNA play important role also system control protein level . At moment lot question remain answered till study rather restrict statistic strength frequently inconsistent date moreover retrospective . Major retrospective study necessary distinguish relationship DNA/protein pattern clinical relevant endpoint like prognosis toxicity broad possible patient group monitor . For reason want take blood sample MAASTRO clinic patient lung cancer store encrypt perform DNA protein analyse future correlate result survival toxicity treatment .</detailed_description>
