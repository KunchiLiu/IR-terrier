	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , ixabepilone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide stop spread . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving ixabepilone together vorinostat may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I trial study side effect , best way give , best dose vorinostat give together ixabepilone treat patient breast cancer spread another place body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability combination vorinostat ixabepilone . II . To determine best schedule delivery drug combination . III . To recommend phase II dose vorinostat combination ixabepilone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate and/or clinical benefit rate . II . To assess toxicity profile . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collecting circulate tumor cell pre post-treatment study deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) somatic mutation methylation assay introduction histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) inhibitor ixabepilone . II . To determine whether administration vorinostat ixabepilone alter pharmacokinetics vorinostat . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I ( Cohort A ) : Patients receive oral vorinostat daily day 1-14 ixabepilone intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 2 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II ( Cohort B ) : Patients receive oral vorinostat daily day 1-7 15-21 . Patients also receive ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 2 , 9 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
