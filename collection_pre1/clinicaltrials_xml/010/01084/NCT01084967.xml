	<detailed_description>Obesity become major worldwide challenge public health , owe interaction obesogenic environment strong genetic contribution.Previous study find genetic factor determine 40 % -70 % obese phenotype.Under circumstance , screen obesity susceptibility gene particularly important society family take measure prevent obesity . Recent extensive genome-wide association study ( GWASs ) identify numerous single nucleotide polymorphism associate obesity , loci together account small fraction know heritable component.Two study 2010 Nature , first time , put rare copy number variation ( CNV ) association severe early-onset obesity.Their significance lie discovery pathogenic gene severe early-onset obesity , importantly , provide new strategy find gene cause complex disease . Obese patient healthy lean control prove series blood biochemical examination enrol study.The present study intend use technique enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR , gene chip , construction viral vector , transfection , take advantage establish database , mean serum assay functional test , associate copy number variation obesity phenotype explain root cause obesity.Meanwhile biomarkers genetic risk factor evaluate study subject .</detailed_description>
