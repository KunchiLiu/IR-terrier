	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare pharmacokinetic profile colchicine primary metabolite plasma urine follow single 0.6 mg oral dose colchicine healthy adult normal renal function , patient mild , moderate severe renal impairment , patient end-stage renal disease hemodialysis . An additional objective study study clearance colchicine metabolites hemodialysis . Secondary objective include evaluation safety tolerability colchicine study population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>40 male female subject enrol study stratify one five group base renal status determine creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) estimate use serum creatinine ( sCR ) Cockcroft-Gault Modified Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation follow : Treatment group 1 - healthy adult normal renal function ( CrCL/eGFR &gt; 90 mL/min ) ; Treatment group 2 , 3 4 - patient mild ( CrCL/eGFR 60-89 mL/min ) , moderate ( CrCL/eGFR 30 59 mL/min ) , severe ( CrCL/eGFR 15 29 mL/min ) renal impairment , respectively ; Treatment group 5 - subject end-stage renal disease require hemodialysis . On study day 1 , participant Treatment Groups 1 4 administer one colchicine 0.6 mg tablet 8 a.m. standard fast condition . Blood sample collect participant dose blood urine sample collect 120 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine primary metabolite . There two study period treatment group 5 ; Period 1 dialysis Period 2 dialysis 14 day washout period two study period . On study day 1 , participant treatment group 5 administer one colchicine 0.6 mg tablet standard fasting condition immediately follow dialysis . Blood sample collect participant dose 70 hour post-dose time sufficient adequately determine pharmacokinetics colchicine primary metabolite . All adverse event evaluate investigator report participant 's case report form .</detailed_description>
