	<detailed_description>The exposure tobacco relate carcinogen highly dependent upon dose well interindividual characteristic metabolism . Risk assessment carcinogenic profile nicotine individual metabolite complicate interindividual variation nicotine metabolism associate quantitative nicotine exposure , gender , genetic polymorphism , behavioral environmentally induced difference nicotine metabolize enzyme activity . Consequently , difference smoke behavior tobacco use correlate difference nicotine metabolism result cessation strategy base upon tobacco use , nicotine dependence , behavioral modification . Cotinine show reliable marker nicotine exposure reflective recent rather acute nicotine use well assessment baseline nicotine level . Therefore , subject blood sample draw weekly radiation cotinine analysis . Radiation therapy efficacy know dependent tissue oxygen status . Since therapeutic treatment less efficacious patient poorly vascularized/ hypoxic tumor , desirable identify target patient special treatment . Recent magnetic resonance imaging compute tomography investigation show significant blood flow change radiation chemo-radiation therapy , suggest early blood flow may prognostic value . Among method oxygen blood flow measurement , near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) benefit merit non-invasive , portable , fast test , inexpensive . Our instrument system combine near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ( DRS ) diffuse correlation spectroscopy ( DCS ) capable monitoring tissue oxygen blood flow simultaneously . This hybrid diffuse optical instrument already use monitor therapeutic effect ( e.g. , radiation therapy , chemotherapy ) tumor human head &amp; neck breast . In study , use hybrid instrument investigate hemodynamic response different therapy ( radiation alone , radiation + chemotherapy ) patient different nicotine level . Baseline measurement tissue oxygen saturation , total hemoglobin concentration blood flow use hybrid optical instrument ( DRS oxygen measurement DCS blood flow measurement ) . A hand-hold optical probe connect hybrid instrument place head/neck tumor 3-5 minute , move normal arm muscle control purposeTumor oxygenation flow measurement perform begin every week treatment period . During monitor process non-invasive blood pressure monitoring also occur . Weekly optical measurement obtain treatment.In study investigate hemodynamic response different nicotine level different therapy ( radiation alone , radiation + chemotherapy ) .</detailed_description>
