	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : Phase 1 : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /maximum administer dose ( MAD ) SAR650984 ( Isatuximab ) . Phase 2 ( stage 1 ) : To evaluate activity single-agent Isatuximab different doses/schedules select dose regimen evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) Isatuximab single agent combination dexamethasone . Phase 2 ( stage 2 ) : To evaluate activity term overall response rate ( ORR ) Isatuximab select dose/schedule stage1 , single agent ( ISA arm ) combination dexamethasone ( ISAdex arm ) . Secondary Objectives : Phase 1 : - To characterize global safety profile include cumulative toxicity . - To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile Isatuximab propose dose schedule ( ) . - To assess pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , immune response , preliminary disease response . Phase 2 ( stage 1 ) : evaluate follow objective Isatuximab single agent : - Safety - Efficacy measure duration response , clinical benefit rate , progression free survival , overall survival . Phase 2 ( stage 2 ) : evaluate follow objective arm ( ISA ISAdex ) : - Safety - Efficacy measure duration response , clinical benefit rate , progression free survival , overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 study duration individual patient include screen period inclusion 2 week , treatment Isatuximab QW ( every week ) Q2W ( every 2 week ) unless discontinue earlier due safety disease progression . Patients follow minimum 30 day follow last use study drug 30 day case unresolved toxicity , initiation another anticancer treatment . The Phase 2 study duration individual patient include screen period inclusion 3 week , treatment period follow period . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable adverse reaction reason discontinuation . Patients follow every 3 month follow last use study drug death study cutoff whichever come first .</detailed_description>
