	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Immune Response Investigational Dengue Type 1 Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dengue virus cause approximately 50 million case dengue fever 1.5 million case severe disease dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHS ) dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ) every year . There four subtypes virus , infection one offer protection infection others . In fact , case DHS DSS occur people infect one subtype . In area world multiple subtypes dengue common , vaccine must develop subtypes dengue virus . This study examine safety immune response investigational vaccine prevent infection DEN1 . Participation study last 6 week . Participants randomly assign inject either investigational study vaccine placebo . Participants five six chance receive vaccine . The first study visit take place vaccination day , participant undergo physical examination , blood draw , pregnancy test , receive vaccine . Participants give thermometer temperature card , tell record temperature three time per day 16 day vaccination . Participants come follow-up visit every day 16 day vaccination , 3 , 4 , 6 week vaccination ( Days 21 , 28 , 42 ) . Assessments complete visit include questionnaire participant feeling , pregnancy test , review temperature card , blood draw , physical exam . Blood drawn analyze check participant ' health , determine amount vaccine antibody blood , test marker white blood cell gene , look proteins important fight dengue infection .</detailed_description>
