	<brief_summary>The incidence malaria , include incidence pregnant woman , decline many African country . Thus , need re-examine efficacy cost effectiveness give intermittent preventive treatment sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine pregnancy ( SP-IPTp ) several occasion pregnancy , intervention threaten increase resistance SP . Possible alternative SP-IPTp need explore . This apply especially area highly seasonal malaria transmission woman risk short period year . The goal project determine whether pregnant woman sleep long lasting insecticide treat bed net , screen treatment schedule antenatal clinic visit effective protecting anaemia , low birth weight placental infection SP-IPTp . Primigravidae secundigravidae present antenatal clinic study site four West African country ( Burkina Faso , Ghana , Mali The Gambia ) randomise one two group . All woman give long lasting insecticide treat bed net first presentation antenatal clinic . Women group 1 ( reference group ) receive SP-IPTp accord current WHO guideline . Those group 2 screen rapid diagnostic test schedule antenatal clinic visit treat parasitaemic . Approximately 5000 woman recruit , 2500 group . Women encourage deliver hospital maternal haemoglobin birth weight record placental sample obtain . Those deliver home visit within week delivery maternal haemoglobin infant weight record . Mothers infant see six week delivery . Also delivery peripheral maternal blood sample obtain diagnosis malaria use RDT , microscopy PCR . The primary end point trial birth weight anaemia 38 week ( +/-2 week ) gestation . The study power show non-inferiority group 2 compare group 1 . The cost cost effectiveness intervention evaluate . In light recent evidence suggest malaria infection pregnancy , particularly last trimester may influence infant 's risk malaria , propose follow infant bear mother recruit Navrongo site Ghana receive either IST IPTp pregnancy throughout whole first year life beyond six week originally propose . We receive approval ethic committee Kwame Nkrumah University Science Technology , Ghana Health Service Navrongo Health Research Centre . The aim obtain information incidence symptomatic asymptomatic malaria infection infant follow infant . The study provide information national malaria control program whether alternative , safe effective method SP IPTp regimen reduce burden malaria pregnancy .</brief_summary>
