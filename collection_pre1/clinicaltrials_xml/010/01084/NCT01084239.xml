	<brief_summary>The grow availability cardiac compute tomography ( CT ) * emergency department ( EDs ) across U.S. expand opportunity clinical application , also heighten need define appropriate use evaluation patient acute chest pain . To address need , perform randomize diagnostic trial ( RDT ) determine whether integrate cardiac CT , along information provide coronary artery disease ( CAD ) leave ventricular ( LV ) function , improve efficiency management patient ( i.e . shorten length hospital stay , increase direct discharge rate ED , decrease healthcare cost improve cost effectiveness safe ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Rule Out Myocardial Infarction Cardiac Computed Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients acute chest pain normal non-diagnostic electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) represent cohort whose management notably inefficient diagnostically challenge . Because less 30 % EDs diagnostic testing ( e.g . nuclear imaging , echocardiography , exercise treadmill ECG ) would allow physician rule occurrence myocardial ischemia perform part initial evaluation , patient hospitalize 24 36 hour exclude presence acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Of six million acute chest pain patient admit year U.S. condition , le 10 % ultimately receive diagnosis ACS discharge . Moreover , inpatient care negative evaluation impart economic burden excess $ 8 billion annually . Since acute myocardial ischemia necrosis rare absence coronary artery disease , technology reliably identifies CAD may allow physician discharge chest pain patient directly ED . Cardiac CT safe , high-speed , noninvasive imaging technique accurately detect coronary atherosclerotic plaque stenosis , also allow physician assess global regional LV function . Observational study demonstrate approximately 40 % acute chest pain patient evidence atherosclerosis cardiac CT , additional 30 % evidence hemodynamically significant ( &gt; 50 % ) coronary artery stenosis . Both criterion powerful predictor absence ACS major adverse cardiovascular event ( negative predictive value [ NPV ] 98 % ) . The specificity cardiac CT increase global regional LV function normal . Several study demonstrate cardiac CT , high NPV , effectively use rule ACS , little known willingness ability ED physicians use information augment patient management . We therefore perform trial 9 clinical site randomized 1000 patient acute chest pain normal non-diagnostic ECGs , receive either standard ED evaluation ( intervention ) cardiac CT ( experimental ) evaluation acute chest pain emergency room . ( Rule Out Myocardial Infarction use Computer Assisted Computed Tomography [ ROMICAT II ] ) .</detailed_description>
