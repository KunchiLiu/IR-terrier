	<detailed_description>To date standard non-surgical treatment strategy treat un-ruptured intracranial aneurysm use either coil self-expandable stent . The flow diverter stent concept base upon hemodynamic exclusion aneurysm sac , without coil eventually place within sac . The primary objective post-market clinical investigation demonstrate use CE-marked , commercially available SILK Artery Reconstruction Device indication approve , notably treatment ( occlusion ) intracranial aneurysm , anatomical result superior compare standard treatment commercially available intracranial coil ( use eventual balloon remodel and/or stent necessary ) . It prospective , randomize , unblinded , multi-center post-market clinical investigation . The patient population comprise maximum 160 subject least one document untreated , unruptured intracranial aneurysm suitable occlusion intracranial device . Subject enrollment require maximum 18 month . Enrolled subject follow 12 month treatment .</detailed_description>
