	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate FDA-approved drug nelfinavir ( NFV ) oncologic agent adenoid cystic cancer head neck . Specifically , subject ask take 1250 mg twice daily follow-up medical oncologist clinically indicate take medication . Subjects would evaluate quality life issue utilize EORTC QLQ-C30 2-page questionnaire . Subjects would also evaluate clinically oncologist determine NFV anti-neoplastic effect . The study remain unfunded . Therefore , potential subject must willing provide self-travel study site . This study require screen visit , initial study visit , monthly follow-up . Subjects reimburse time , travel , physician cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis study nelfinavir , inhibit Akt MAPK pathway , inhibit adenoid cystic carcinoid growth . These cancer heavily dependent signal pathway . Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) rare account 1 % head neck cancer . They stem salivary gland know tendency spread along nerve sheath ( perineural spread ) . ACC know prolonged clinical course , multiple recurrence delay onset distant metastasis . The median/mean age presentation 47-56 . Although 5 year disease free survival ( DFS ) 65-70 % , 15 year DFS drop 30-40 % . If follow long enough , 35 % patient eventually develop metastatic disease . The common treatment ACC surgery follow post-operative radiotherapy . When ACC recur , management option often limited morbidity low efficacy re-irradiation repeat surgical resection . Reported response rate chemotherapy low occurs , duration response short live . In effort explore possible targeted therapy patient recurrent ACC , Dr. Gupta 's lab examine activation 3 signal protein ( EGFR , Akt , MAPK ) 9 different paraffinized tissue block . Initial indication vitro study demonstrate NFV tumoricidal clinically achievable concentration . To explore clinical benefit FDA-approved medication , seek implement label use patient fail therapy therapeutic option leave .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological diagnosis adenoid cystic carcinoma . Cancer stag recurrent endstage with/without metastasis fail therapy . Age ≥ 18 year ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky ≥ 50 % , see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mm3 absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3 total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl OR stable decrease bilirubin patient undergone placement intrabiliary stent AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . No known HIV infection . Since NFV use HIV patient , want interfere therapy patient may already . Not pregnant . The effect NFV develop human fetus study HIV positive woman ( 21 ) . We , however , know risk along radiation . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition NFV . Uncontrolled diabetes . Hemophilia A &amp; B increase bleed protease inhibitor therapy report ( 22 ) . Patients may receive investigational agent . concomitant medication counterindicated use nelfinavir Pregnant lactate woman : The effect NFV develop human fetus study HIV positive woman ( 21 ) . In addition , chemotherapy deleterious fetus . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction NFV .</criteria>
