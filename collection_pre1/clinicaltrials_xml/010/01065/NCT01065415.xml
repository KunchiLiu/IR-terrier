	<brief_summary>The accurate stag essential part treatment prognosis non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Whole body MR image prove effective stag NSCLC much PET/CT . And organs strength modality detection metastasis . Therefore , integrate approach use whole body MR PET would beneficial accurate stag lung cancer improve diagnostic efficacy reduce radiation exposure . The aim project evaluate diagnostic efficacy side-by-side reading whole-body magnetic resonance imaging/ positron emission tomography ( MRI/PET ) compare whole-body magnetic resonance imaging ( WB MRI ) alone integrated PET/CT determine stage NSCLC . Patients pathologically-proven NSCLC prospectively enrol , consider surgical candidate treatment lung cancer conventional method stag , i.e . history taking , physical examination , blood test , bronchoscopy , enhance chest CT scan . PET/CT routinely perform stag lung cancer institution . For purpose study , whole body MRI perform patient within 3 day date acquisition PET/CT . The result TNM stag modality collect prospectively efficacy calculate base reference standard . Reference standard T N stag surgically confirm . And M stag confirm biopsy , image modality , follow-up 6 month . Diagnostic efficacy coregistered MRI/PET evaluate comparison consecutive two-arm enrollment random assignment control group study group follow : - control group : routine stag work-up chest CT , PET/CT , brain MRI - study group : routine stag work-up plus whole body MRI Coregistered MRI/PET</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 75 80 % lung cancer , currently lead cause tumor-related death ( 1 ) . Optimal lung cancer treatment relies accurate disease staging , base tumor size extent , regional nodal involvement , presence metastasis . Although thoracic CT consider standard modality choice assess intrathoracic spread lung cancer ( 2 ) , consensus reach concern metastasis evaluation . [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) introduce develop integrated modality accurate nodal stag metastatic lesion detection whole body ( WB ) ( 3-9 ) . Currently , integrate PET/CT , provide morphologic metabolic feature , appear achieve well efficacy stag lung cancer CT alone PET alone ( 8 , 10 ) . Whole body magnetic resonance imaging ( WB MRI ) become feasible enables fast scan throughout body ( 11-13 ) . This technique base real-time gradient-echo imaging slide table platform ( roll table concept , eliminate time-consuming reposition patient surface coil ) . MRI scanner late generation use high field MRI unit &gt; 1.5 Tesla ( T ) , report upgraded capability term temporal spatial resolution due improve signal-to-noise ratio ( SNRs ) high magnetic-field strength condition ( 14 , 15 ) . Because integrated PET/CT WB MRI provide WB imaging , modality use stag patient malignant condition . According report ( 16 ) , diagnostic efficacy PET/CT superior WB MRI T N stag similar WB MRI detect metastasis . However , accord another study ( 17 ) , WB MRI show good sensitivity PET/CT detect metastatic lesion . In study ( 16 , 17 ) , 1.5T MR unit use , regional nodal metastatic lesion various type primary malignancy wide range tumor stage . Recently publish paper regard diagnostic efficacy comparison determine TNM stage integrate PET/CT 3T WB MRI patient NSCLC ( 18 ) . In study , find PET/CT 3T whole body MRI appear provide acceptable accuracy comparable efficacy non-small cell lung cancer staging , M stage determination , modality advantage . Namely , WB MRI useful detect brain hepatic metastasis , whereas PET/CT lymph node soft-tissue metastasis . Therefore , suggest whole body MR/PET future image modality NSCLC stag especially M stag . Although PET/CT scanner quickly become establish , development MRI/PET slower , due additional challenge develop dual-modality system avoid deleterious interaction cause high magnetic field environment MRI scanner radiofrequency ( RF ) interference PET MRI system . At moment , MRI/PET still development use small animal study ( 19 ) . Thus , purpose research provide clinical corroborating data show effective future MRI/PET human use especially patient NSCLC provide efficiency side-by-side reading WB MRI/PET compare PET/CT .</detailed_description>
