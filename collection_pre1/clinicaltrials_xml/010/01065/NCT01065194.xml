	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Pulsed Infusions Levosimendan Outpatients With Advanced Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Significant advance make treatment congestive heart failure ( CHF ) past year . Neurohumoral therapy ACE-inhibitors , ß-blockers aldosterone antagonist establish significantly reduce morbidity mortality . However , despite advance modern therapy advance CHF remain syndrome poor prognosis . Additionally , syndrome associate poor quality life lead progressive debiliation cardial cachexia . Repeat hospitalization acute heart failure common among severe CHF patient . Besides discomfort patient hospital admission constitute lion 's share health expenditure heart failure syndrome . Inotropic support provide patient suffer acute heart failure refractory neurohumoral therapy . This approach perform accord AHA/ACC- well ESC Guidelines therapy CHF . Inotropic therapy target hemodynamic stabilization , improvement functional status , reduction rehospitalization . Moreover , many centre treatment inotropes dobutamine milrinone integral part apply bridge transplant concept severe heart failure patient . In fact , continuous pulse inotropic support severe heart failure patient test repeatedly small clinical study . Intermittent ambulatory low dose administration dobutamine versus conventional therapy improve functional capacity DICE-Trial . By contrast , several case series different dose regimen dobutamine indicate improvement functional status . TRIAL RATIONALE Based pharmacologic profile Levosimendan appear promising treatment severe chronic heart failure functional NYHA class III/IV improve quality life physical activity reduce hospital admission acute heart failure . Repeat drug administration may superior single shot therapy maintain beneficial long-term result . For economical reason sake patient comfort drug administration ideally manage outpatient basis rather hospital . Therefore practical reason , time period six hour drug administration might reasonable . Dosing drug base experience Russlan Trial small case report Martys . In latter study serial administration levosimendan 6 hour ( bolus 12 mcg/kg follow continuous infusion 0,1 μg/kg/min 50min 0,2 μg/kg/min next 5 hour ) induce significant fall BNP . In outpatient setting , however , bolus give safety reason .</detailed_description>
