	<brief_title>Patients Infected With HIV Since More Than 10 Years With Plasma Viral RNA &lt; 400 Copies / mL Absence Any Treatment : Study Mechanisms Involved Controlling Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study virological immunological feature patient , consortium research team set . Several result obtain ( cf publication ) : HIC infect replication-competent virus , HIV infect HIC CD4 T cell ex vivo CD8 T cell fully control viral replication . This study lead set national observatory HICs . This observatory , set May 2006 May 2008 , allow identify include 86 HIC patient France ( one hundred report ANRS center ) . When patient include , clinical data collect biologic collection set use genomic study . The main characteristic patient include observatory median age diagnosis HIV infection 29 year ( range 1-49 ) , median age inclusion 45 year [ 19-78 ] , 42 % woman , 87 % caucasian . The median year HIV diagnosis 1989 ( 1983-1999 ) , median 18 year know HIV infection . The CD4 median 1986 2008 762 CD4/mm3 [ IQR:589-962 ] , 3 % 1368 measure ≤ 350 /mm3 ; 23 % patient CD4 T cell count &lt; 500/mm3 6 % &lt; 350/mm3 inclusion consultation . The CD4 slope period show slow decrease estimate -13 [ -15 , -11 ] CD4/mm3 per year . Between 1989 2007 , 2 % viral load measure ≥ 1000 RNA copies/mL . The viral load inclusion &gt; 400 RNA copies/mL 4 % . Median viral DNA inclusion observatory 1 , 75 [ 1 , 44-2 , 07 ] log copies/millions PBMC . The transformation observatory cohort CO 18 several goal . The first one allow long-term follow-up HIV controller . Epidemiological , clinical , virological , immunological data collect . The outcome patient major question : patient could loose HIC status either drop CD4 T cell count level 200/mm3 without major viral replication viral replication become detectable . To understand mechanism involve control viral replication HIC implies study patient viral control lose compare HIC control preserve . Therefore major importance follow patient include observatory prolonged time . To increase frequency loss control , patient virus control least 5 year less 10 year include increase diversity HICs . Clinical event neoplasias collect . The genomic study continue benefit new inclusion european collaboration develop . The question quality-of-life patient HIC study .</detailed_description>
