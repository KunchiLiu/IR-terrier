	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety combination two drug cediranib temsirolimus high dos two drug give combination people safely . Cediranib drug may stop blood supply tumor therefore help keep cancer cell grow . Temsirolimus drug may stop cancer cell grow . These drug use research study ovarian kidney cancer study suggest drug may help keep cancer grow research study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD2171 Temsirolimus Patients With Advanced Gynecological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- We look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant recurrent gynecological cancer . Not everyone participate research study receive dose study drug . - There sample blood take measure additional effect study drug look marker participant 's particular type cancer . Blood take certain point study evaluate interaction two study drug , cediranib temsirolimus give together . These call pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample . About 6 teaspoon blood take PK sample total 34 sample take . - Participants give study medication diary treatment cycle . Each cycle last four week ( 28 day ) . Temsirolimus give day 1 , 8 , 15 22 cycle . Cediranib wil take orally daily morning . - Participants ask monitor blood pressure daily basis home keep blood pressure diary . - The following test procedure perform specific time period course study : medical history ; side effect assessment ; physical exam ; vital sign ; blood test ; CT scan ; MUGA ECHO ; EKG urine test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients metastatic endometrial cancer Patients recurrent ovarian , fallopian peritoneal cancer Patients recurrent cervical cancer Patients may either measurable nonmeasurable disease Up one prior line chemotherapy recurrent set allow . Biologic therapy consider prior line hormonal therapy count . No prior VEGF inhibitor therapy allow . Toxic side effect relate prior chemotherapy hormonal therapy must resolve less equal grade 1 baseline ( exclude alopecia ) , peripheral neuropathy less equal grade 2 . Subjects may begin AZD2171 temsirolimus least 3 week last dose chemotherapy hormonal therapy , assume otherwise eligible . 18 year age old At present , potential AZD2171 clinically significant drug interaction involve CYP isozymes unknown . Eligibility patient receive medication substance know affect teh potential affect activity PK AZD2171 determine follow review case principal investigator . Subjects treat limited stage basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ breast cervix eligible otherwise meet eligibility . Subjects stage I II cancer treat curative intent also eligible evidence recurrent disease . No evidence preexist uncontrolled hypertension . If patient hypertension , must medically control prior start AZD2171 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior study entry . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . No therapeutic anticoagulation . The use low dose warfarin , intermittent dos TPA , heparin flush prophylaxis central venous catheterassociated clot permit . ECOG Performance status 02 Patients must normal organ marrow function define protocol Patients chemotherapy , radiotherapy , major surgery within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent participate investigational trial within past 4 week . Prior bevacizumab allow . Patients may receive medication may markedly affect renal function . NSAIDs avoid possible . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . A CT head require prior entry study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AZD2171 . Mean QTc 470msec great screen electrocardiogram history familial long QT syndrome . Greater +1 proteinuria two consecutive dipstick take less 1 week apart Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited hypertension , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Inability take absorb orally administer medication . Pregnant woman . Breastfeeding discontinue . Major surgical procedure medical interference peritoneum pleura within 4 week baseline CA125 assessment . This exclude need paracentesis .
