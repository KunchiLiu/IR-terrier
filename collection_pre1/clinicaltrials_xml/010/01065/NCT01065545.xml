In chemotherapy study , small percentage ( 30 % 40 % ) patient achieve CR still disease-free 5 year later . The outcome older adult even less favorable . Approximately 75 % elderly patient achieve CR relapse 2 year less toxicity see treatment significant . A number study show chemotherapy give old adult remission improve outcome ; therefore new treatment need investigate . Clofarabine drug study old adult achieve CR . The treatment find few side effect consolidation therapy . This study give participant drug longer period time see extend cancer remission .
