	<brief_summary>1 . Balloon-assisted enteroscopy ( BAE ) new tool investigate small intestinal disease . 2 . Deep enteroscopy make possible balloon expansion manipulation small intestine . 3 . However , whether intestinal barrier injure BAE predispose patient bacteremia clinical relevant infection study . 4 . We also examine relevant patient factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The newly develop balloon-assisted enteroscopy system allow insertion enteroscopy deeply small intestine fixation soft , redundant small intestine inflatable balloon tip overtube . However , inflation balloon might stimulate intestinal mucosa , deep manipulation intestinal segment might also compromise intestinal barrier function . According preliminary experience balloon-assisted enteroscopy ( among first group Taiwan ) , experience significant case suspect post-procedural bactermia patient . Besides , also publish case report UK report Streptococcus milleri bacteremia suspect bacterial translocation balloon-assisted enteroscopy . However , currently original study focus intestinal barrier / permeability defect bacterial translocation . This timely novel research topic current develop era balloon-assisted enteroscopy .</detailed_description>
