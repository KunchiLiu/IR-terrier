	<brief_summary>Use lay language . Background : Heart failure increasingly frequent current pathology due population age improvement acute chronic heart failure management . Heart failure patient poor quality life symptom ( asthenia , dyspnea… ) frequent hospitalization . Heart failure expensive disease : 1.5 % health expense , 85 % hospital cost 200 000 hospitalization France per year . Previous study multidisciplinary intervention realistic daily practice general practitioner . The aim project integrate therapeutic education heart failure patient current practice . The patient become competent manage disease identify acute heart failure sign . Main objective : Improve therapeutic education efficiency life quality heart failure patient general practice . Second objective : Describe heart failure patient 's hospitalization . Methods : Cluster randomize controlled clinical trial compare intervention control group follow 19 month patient . A therapeutic education program propose heart failure patient primary care . The intervention group GP follow workshop concern therapeutic education concept intervention . Endpoints : Life quality evaluation ( SF-36 Minnesota scale ) number hospitalization patient group . Population : Heart failure patient stag I , II , III NYHA primary care . Cluster randomize surgery Auvergne ( France ) . Expected result : The therapeutic education allow patient improve quality life , able detect illness sign worsen early manner , contact doctor need . This would limit acute heart failure due treatment adaptation life habit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General organisation study - Recruitment GP : 3 month ( January March 2010 ) - Training intervention group GP two day workshop April 2010 therapeutic education intervention expert team - Patient Inclusions GP : 10 month ( April 2010 January 2011 ) . The included patient follow 19 month . Some patient potentially recruit 10th month inclusion , follow-up period 29 month . - First consultation use inclusion : - Information patient collection patient write agreement ( without inform intervention objective control group ) . - Evaluation life quality group SF-36 scale ( general ) Minnesota scale ( HF specific ) write patient his/her main caregiver ( wife husband , friend ... ) wait room consultation thanks close envelope give GP contain questionnaire pre-paid envelope . - Intervention general practitioner patient scope therapeutic education program : - In intervention group : first session ( M1 ) dedicate educative diagnosis one month . Then 4 session standardize therapeutic education adapt patient three month one year . One session M19 dedicate synthesis patient learnt intervention . - In control group : patient follow consultation deadline without particular intervention M1 , M4 , M7 , M10 , M13 , M19 . - Life quality evaluation group 0 , 7 , 13 , 19 month begin inclusion fill patient his/her main caregiver ( husband wife , friend ... ) thanks close envelope give GP ( end consultation ) contain questionnaire pre-paid envelope . These document fill wait room first consultation home 7 day follow consultation . The life quality evaluate inclusion time ( M0 ) , intervention ( M7 M13 ) distance ( M19 ) end intervention . The Minnesota score ( 22 , 23 ) chosen validate specific life quality HF patient . The SF-36 score also retain permit generic global evaluation life quality reliability , validity responsiveness establish ( 24 ) ( 25 ) ( 26 ) . SF-36 widely evaluate quality life measure 1990 1999 ( 27 ) . - Collection number duration hospital readmission worsen heart failure cause hospital readmission total number day hospitalisation follow-up period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Investigators : volunteer randomize general practitioner Auvergne region France . The GPs randomize cluster , GP recruit least five patient . If several doctor part surgery , randomize group ( intervention control ) . The randomization GPs stratify department . The GP commit talk study . Each GP know group study belong intervention group comprise train seminar objective study know GPs control group . All general practitioner Auvergne ( except homeopath , acupuncture ... ) contact mail inform study invite participate . The volunteer GPs return write agreement via prestamped envelope investigator center coordinate . They randomize group ( intervention control ) . After formation , GP intervention group would recruit least five patient see consultation , could include give write agreement . Each week inclusion period , GP recruit first patient eligibility criterion inclusion least five patient . The anonymity patient guarantee participation contract . The data anonymized investigator GP submit French electronic data liberty commission ( Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés ( CNIL ) ) . The patient could quit study time . Patients : Systolic diastolic HF patient stag I , II III NYHA follow primary care . These patient recruit randomized GP intervention control group . Patients 50 year old ( age limit expel patient particular pathology ) . • Are include stage IV , short life expectancy , low efficiency hope test measure , . The systolic diastolic HF patient distinguish possible efficiency intervention HF type dependent priori . Dementia Alzheimer disease diagnose GP . Already include another study Incapacity follow education session ( language problem ... )</criteria>
