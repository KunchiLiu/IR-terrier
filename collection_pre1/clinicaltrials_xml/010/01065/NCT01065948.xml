	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn new minimally invasive glucose monitoring device call Fluorescence Affinity Sensor ( FAS ) . In study , FAS use determine effectiveness glucose monitoring . Researchers want find device performs two different body site ( forearm abdomen ) 4 hour . The safety comfort level device also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study Assess Critical Aspects Fluorescence Affinity Sensor ( FAS ) Performance Safety Over Several Hours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FAS glucose monitoring system minimally invasive glucose monitoring device yet approve FDA . The FAS system use study monitor glucose level glucose tolerance test ( GTT ) perform Dr.Orzeck practice . The FAS measure glucose level skin tissue forearm abdomen depth less 1 mm insert small needle-like device . During 4-hour GTT , needle-like FAS leave skin tissue . The FAS performance indicate prior experiment stable competitive commercial glucose-sensing device . Due unique design , glucose response accurate , less affected certain drug ( pain medicine ) .</detailed_description>
