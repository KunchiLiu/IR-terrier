	<brief_summary>The goal research study learn new type PET scan ( 18F-FLT ) help well detect change tumor growth rate ( active ) esophagus cancer . Researchers study time treatment 18F-FLT PET scan give get best result . A Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan type scan us radioactive solution locate cancer cell inside body . Using PET scan , doctor locate solid tumor collect information `` active '' cancer cell . For study , new type solution , [ F-18 ] fluoro-L-thymidine ( FLT ) , use . FLT detect actively grow tumor , researcher hope FLT may able help provide information well esophagus cancer treatment work . This information could use help predict cancer respond treatment . All enrolled subject receive 4D-PET/ CT image pre-chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) post-CRT prior esophagectomy . At time 4D-PET/ CT procedure , subject receive injection FLT investigational pharmaceutical label radioactive fluorine . Each scan process might take 45 60 minute . The 4DPET/ CT image pre-CRT post-CRT compare evaluated pathological assessment surgical specimen . Participation pilot study change patient normal chemotherapy , radiation treatment , surgery recommend patient physician part standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Prediction Pathologic Complete Response ( pathCR ) With Fluoro-L-Thymidine ( FLT ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study obtain preliminary data initial estimate FLT ability ( FluoroLThymidine ) -PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) identify pathCR ( pathologic complete response ) patient esophageal carinoma undergo Chemo-RT prior surgery . Despite improvement surgical management , long-term survival rate patient esophageal cancer change dramatically . Achievement pathCR pre-operative CRT ( chemoradiotherapy ) associate improved patient outcome ; however , effective method predict pathological response surgery . Thus , patient pathCR , esophagectomy may unnecessary , still undergoes surgery face prohibitive side effect surgical procedure . Additionally , CRT associate considerable morbidity tool predict avoid ineffective therapy lacking . Because deregulated proliferation one hallmark cancer proliferation rate associate aggressive biologic behavior response therapy , image proliferative state cancer cell noninvasive functional imaging great interest . Recently 18F-FLT ( 3'deoxy33'-18F-fluorothymidine ) report promising PET radiopharmaceutical imaging cancer proliferation validate several vitro &amp; vivo model . However , study address role depicting change cancer proliferation assess response CRT , none study focus esophageal cancer . We propose conduct pilot study learn optimal FLT PET image timepoint early course CRT high predictive value pathCR patient esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
