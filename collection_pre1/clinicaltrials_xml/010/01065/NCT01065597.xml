	<brief_summary>This study involve pilot test modified version proven treatment mental illness . The treatment , electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) use treat 100,000 Americans yearly . ECT effective treatment major depression , disorder affect approximately 5 8 percent adult US population yearly . It also effective treatment mania mixed mood state associate bipolar disorder schizoaffective disorder . The aim ECT induce seizure , think responsible therapeutic adverse cognitive effect . The propose modification consist reduce ECT electrical stimulus dose amount necessary induce seizure adverse cognitive effect , confusion memory problem , minimize . The investigator intend determine whether ECT-related cognitive impairment reduce without diminish therapeutic effect ECT . In addition distressing patient , ECT-related cognitive impairment significant public health consequence . These include increased morbidity mortality among severely ill individual refuse ECT due concern adverse cognitive effect well increase fall among elderly receive ECT . Elderly patient far likely receive ECT also vulnerable ECT-related cognitive impairment . They often require hospitalization ECT long hospital stay great space treatment minimize adverse cognitive effect . The hypothesis drive research electrical brain stimulation apply manner standard ECT , low dose , therapeutic effect few adverse cognitive effect without induce seizure . This hypothesis base following : 1 ) investigator clinical experience patient improve ECT despite one seizure , 2 ) animal study show electrical brain stimulation induce antidepressant like effect animal without induce seizure , 3 ) report 1950s `` subconvulsive '' `` nonconvulsive '' electrotherapy effective patient , 4 ) recent approval US Food Drug Administration use transcranial magnetic stimulation -- technique us magnet induce electrical current brain without induce seizure -- treatment medication resistant major depression . The primary aim research conduct proof concept , open trial investigate therapeutic efficacy safety nonconvulsive electrotherapy ( NET ) . The investigator plan enroll 16 subject , minimum number subject need show therapeutic effect NET well would expect placebo . If investigator show therapeutic effect NET exceeds expect placebo induce significant cognitive impairment , investigator go propose blind , randomize , control clinical trial definitively test investigator ' hypothesis . The investigator would use information gather pilot trial estimate number subject need definitively test efficacy safety NET . The secondary aim study find whether NET affect blood level brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . BDNF substance important nervous system may relate treatment like ECT possibly NET improve symptom . The investigator would draw blood sample NET treatment ass .</brief_summary>
