The study approval Institution Research Board . The sample size 200 patients.100 patient arm . Patients triaged moderate severe bronchiolitis evaluate eligible patient admit short stay unit manage usual . History full physical examination do attend physician nurse check 02 sat. , respiratory rate pulse rate . The Bronchiolitis clinical severity score assess guardian eligible patient approach explain purpose treatment modality . Patients include obtain verbal write consent . A CXR RSV test do study patient upon recruitment . The attend physician complete data collection sheet A computer generate randomization code prepared statistician . A pharmacist prepare study medication placebo . Patients randomize either one two treatment : - Ventolin-Dexamethasone group : Oral Dexamethasone 1mg/kg give first day 0.6mg/kg next 4 day addition Ventolin nebulizations .
