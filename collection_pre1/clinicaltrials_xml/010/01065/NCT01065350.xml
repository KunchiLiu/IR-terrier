	<brief_summary>This pilot study compare hemodynamic change occur induction novel drug combination know ketofol ( propofol ketamine admixture propofol alone ( prototypic anesthesia induction agent ) . Propofol ketamine widely use induction agent effect patient hemodynamics well know . Some drug-induced hemodynamic change undesirable lead deleterious effect patient hemodynamics . We seek investigate hemodynamic change associate novel drug combination know ketofol ( ketamine/propofol admixture ) induction compare propofol .

	<brief_title>A Comparison Ketofol ( Ketamine Propofol Admixture ) Versus Propofol Induction Agents Hemodynamic Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study compare hemodynamic change occur induction novel drug combination know ketofol propofol . Propofol ketamine widely use induction agent effect patient hemodynamics well know . Many drug-induced change undesirable use alone sometimes lead hemodynamic effect opposite end spectrum , ie . hypotension ( propofol ) hypertension ( ketamine ) . We investigate hemodynamic change associate drug combination refer `` ketofol '' ( ketamine/propofol admixture ) induction compare propofol gold standard induction agent use widely anesthetic practice . If validate change produce ketofol admixture favorable , test use wider set patient population include emergency department intubation trauma set . Background : Propofol non-opioid , non-barbiturate , sedative-hypnotic agent rapid onset short duration action . It possess many favorable effect antiemetic effect reliably produce sedation amnesia ( Felfernig Jour Royal Naval Medical Service , '06 ; White International Anesth Clinics , '88 ; Willman Ann Emer Med , '07 ) . However , several undesirable side effect cardiovascular respiratory depression . In addition , Propofol sole agent analgesic property . These drug-induced side effect lead alternative drug use hope favorable side effect profile . Ketamine example one drug . Ketamine phencyclidine derivative commonly classify dissociative sedative fairly rapid onset short duration action ( Felfernig Jour Royal Naval Medical Service , '06 ; White International Anesth Clinics , '88 ; Willman Ann Emer Med , '07 ) . It cause little respiratory cardiovascular depression unlike propofol , pain relieving property . Ketamine single induction agent , however , limited emergence phenomenon include postoperative dreaming hallucination , however attenuate administration benzodiazepine . Also ketamine induction dose 1-4.5 mg/kg undesirable effect hemodynamics ( opposite propofol ) certain patient population include ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) , patient increase intracranial hypertension intracranial pressure ( ICP ) . Effectiveness two agent combination recently demonstrate new combination could allow novel induction agent favorable effect hemodynamics ( Felfernig Jour Royal Naval Medical Service , '06 ; Hui Jour Amer Soc Anesth , '95 ; Willman Ann Emer Med , '07 ) . To date , combination know ketofol use extensively procedural sedation Emergency Department yet standardize induction agent . We obtain fund pilot study validate use ketofol induction agent .</detailed_description>
