	<detailed_description>Prompt , sustain complete reperfusion myocardium supply infarct related artery ( IRA ) remain cornerstone therapy treatment ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Although reperfusion achieve use fibrinolytic agent , generally accept primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) preferable , caveat perform promptly experience personnel . It observe 74 % patient STEMI evidence multi-vessel disease ( MVD ) angiography . The presence MVD independently associate bad clinical outcome presence MVD time STEMI predictive need future revascularization within 1 year , half repeat procedure drive development unstable coronary syndrome 8 . However , retrospective analysis determine immediate intervention upon non-culprit vessel ( NCV ) addition IRA associate bad clinical outcome compare strategy intervene upon IRA alone . Furthermore , small study show increase mortality associate strategy delay ( 7 day ) intervention NCV compare strategy intervene IRA alone . Accordingly , consider inappropriate intervene upon non-culprit artery absence demonstrable ischemia follow successful revascularization IRA set STEMI 11 2007 ACC/AHA STEMI guideline give Class IIb recommendation delay intervention upon hemodynamically significant NCV &gt; 24 hour index STEMI . However , guideline provide guidance regard define hemodynamic significance NCV , speak exact time NCV revascularization perform initial 24 hour . Indeed , ambiguity reflect local practice within Vancouver Coastal Health Authority ( R. Boone , personal communication ) , interventional cardiologist perform NCV revascularization index hospitalization prior patient discharge , others bring patient back within 6-8 week index STEMI `` stag '' , elective revascularization NCV . Finally , cardiologist defer NCV revascularization entirely absence recurrent ischemia . There remain significant doubt appropriate treatment strategy STEMI patient find MVD . Unfortunately , clinical dilemma make difficult observation angiographic clinical assessment NCV remain imprecise STEMI setting . It remain unclear whether traditional angiographic assessment NCV reliable time follow index myocardial infarction , use reliably guide decision make revascularization NCV set STEMI . In one study , 10 % lesion judge visual assessment coronary angiogram require NCV PCI follow STEMI , note angiographically significant quantitative coronary angiography time index angiogram 12 . Finally , prior study demonstrate severity non culprit lesion find significantly exaggerated use traditional angiography time index MI . A study 548 patient acute MI MVD reveal 21 % NCV lesion initially think &gt; 50 % time index MI find &lt; 50 % time subsequent angiography . Accordingly , significant interest find alternate mean assess clinically angiographically significant lesion set stable unstable coronary syndrome . Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) simple , reliable reproducible physiological index lesion severity . It define ratio coronary artery pressure distal stenosis aortic root pressure , measure follow maximal dilation distal coronary resistance vessel . FFR reliable index maximal achievable coronary flow . An FFR &lt; 0.8 identifies ischemia-causing coronary stenosis &gt; 90 % accuracy . Conversely , lesion deem nonsignificant FFR safely treat medically annual rate death myocardial infarction &lt; 1 % . Recently , FFR guide strategy elective PCI find superior strategy coronary intervention guide angiography alone . FFR also find reliable modality hemodynamic assessment coronary lesion set acute myocardial infarction , similar correlation FFR percent diameter stenosis coronary vessel acute infarct setting compare FFR amongst match control undergo elective PCI . Additionally , FFR correlate well identification residual reversible perfusion abnormality shortly follow index myocardial infarction ( MI ) . However , remain unknown abnormal FFR NCV remain stable follow acute STEMI . We propose study determine precision stability FFR measure lesion severity NCV patient undergo clinically indicate revascularization culprit vessel set STEMI . Our hypothesis FFR remain stable time within myocardium subtend infarct related artery . We believe FFR potentially serve reliable safe angiographic tool guide delay revascularization decision non-culprit vessel amongst STEMI patient MVD . STUDY SCHEMA Following successful revascularization IRA , patient deem appropriate delay revascularization procedure NCV ( ie index hospitalization ) undergo FFR NCV index catheterization . Consent FFR obtain prior successful revascularization IRA . Patients NCV stenosis bring back planned elective revascularization NCV lesion ( ) , accord usual clinical practice follow revascularization culprit lesion , undergo repeat FFR NCV prior plan revascularization . Patients deem appropriate undergo intervention NCV index hospitalization clinical reason eligible inclusion analysis . ENDPOINTS The primary endpoint study comparison initial repeat FFR NCV amongst STEMI patient MVD deem appropriate delay revascularization NCV . This study stipulate timing NCV revascularization ; decision make treat interventional cardiologist . However expect patient undergo NCV revascularization within 4 8 week follow index hospital stay . Patients require in-hospital revascularization NCV index hospitalization enrol study . Secondary endpoint trial comparison baseline repeat FFR digital subtraction quantitative angiography NCV . Tertiary endpoint evaluation major adverse cardiac event amongst enrol patient repeat procedure . CLINICAL IMPACT We believe result propose study could result significant change management STEMI . A potential finding FFR durable method assess severity NCV setting STEMI could lead shift towards use technology guide decision make revascularization acute coronary syndrome , similar paradigm shift see elective PCI follow publication FAME trial . Furthermore , study expand upon understand angiographic behaviour nonculprit vessel set STEMI , may serve change future recommendation regard revascularization decision amongst patient MVD present acute myocardial infarction</detailed_description>
