	<brief_title>Plerixafor Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) Combination With Azacitidine Treatment Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The interaction normal stem cell bone marrow microenvironment mediate number factor . These interaction implicate protect malignant hematopoietic cell spontaneous apoptosis genotoxic stress chemotherapy . Key element CXCR4 , express normal stem cell leukemic blast , ligand , stromal derive factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) express bone marrow stromal cell osteoblast . The CXCR4/SDF-1 axis essential homing , retention mobilization stem cell bone marrow microenvironment . Plerixafor bicyclam small molecule inhibitor CXCR4 extensively study group others potent stem cell mobilization agent combination G-CSF alone ( 25 , 62 ) . Plerixafor currently investigate phase I/II trial combination salvage chemotherapy relapse AML attempt sensitize leukemia stem cell chemotherapy . The goal study determine optimal dose plerixafor treatment patient high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination G-CSF azacitidine . We hypothesize plerixafor combination G-CSF detach MDS blast bone marrow microenvironment result increased proliferation sensitivity azacitidine ; thus , improve complete partial response rate ( CR/PR ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm MDS 520 % blast bone marrow aspirate time study enrollment AND least one cytopenia . MDS define WHO criteria Previous therapy decitabine azacitidine allow patient must least 4 week prior chemotherapy radiation . Age &gt; =18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use plerixafor combination GCSF azacitidine patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study ; however , eligible future pediatric phase II combination trial . Life expectancy great 2 month . ECOG performance status &lt; = 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; =60 % ; see Appendix 1 ) . Patients must normal organ function define : total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ≤ 2.0 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; =60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Ability patient ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Females child bear potential must agree abstain sexual activity use medically approve contraceptive measure/regimen 3 month treatment period . Women child bear potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test time enrollment . Acceptable method birth control include oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , transdermal/implanted injected contraceptive abstinence . Males must agree abstain sexual activity agree utilize medically approve contraception method 3 month treatment period . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients untreated 5q minus syndrome MDS Patients GCSF GMCSF within 2 week start study Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis . ( These patient exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . ) History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition plerixafor , azacitidine , GCSF , mannitol . History sickle cell anemia . ( GCSF may initiate pain crisis . ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study plerixafor , GCSF , azacitidine agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother azacitidine , GCSF , plerixafor , breastfeed discontinue . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Known HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction plerixafor . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients advance malignant hepatic tumor History cardiac arrhythmia</criteria>
