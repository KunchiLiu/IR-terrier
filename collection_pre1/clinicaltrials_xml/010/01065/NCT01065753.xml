	<brief_title>Multi-faceted Evaluations Following Weight Reduction Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity , particular central obesity , one important document risk factor development diabetes cardiovascular disease . Recent re-delineated various version definition metabolic syndrome , fuel critical involvement central adiposity disorder several facet , include many increase circulate pro-inflammatory cytokine , directly indirectly link visceral adipose tissue expression . Although lots effort devote study central obesity and/or metabolic syndrome , much remain unknown obesity affect cellular well cardiac function , central regulation one 's body weight , measure fat visceral organ precisely . Weight loss undisputed way improve cardiovascular metabolic disorder . Both recent review article data u demonstrate weight loss 5 % initial weight universally deliver benefit obese individual . However , little integrated research team different discipline share common weight reduction protocol look different aspect weight reduction non-diabetic individual metabolic syndrome . The significance proposal plan target explain detail sub-proposal . However , would like make briefing description . 1. . Rho kinase ( ROCK ) serine/threonine kinase mediate downstream signal small guanosine triphosphate- binding protein , Rho , actin cytoskeleton . In mostly animal model , inhibition ROCK ameliorate many cardiovascular condition , include hypertension , atherosclerosis , myocardial fibrosis , stroke . Recent study Taiwan show ROCK activity increase patient metabolic syndrome . 2. . Obese overweight individual increase level arterial stiffness measure aortic large vessel distensibility compliance . Weight loss could induce significant reduction sympathetic activity blood pressure . However , little known whether weight loss improve arterial stiffness , central aortic blood pressure relate hemodynamics . 3. . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , recently report related Alzheimer 's disease , present brain tissue extensively . It also note low circulate level BDNF associate impair glucose metabolism , might associate high BMI body fat . We interesting effect weight reduction circulate BDNF value non-diabetic subject metabolic syndrome . 4. . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) heart frequently use provide accurate reproducible measurement LV mass , volume , systolic function aortic pulse velocity . Although echo-cardiography apply study effect weight loss cardiac function , study use cardiac MRI measure cine image cardiac function relate variable weight reduction non-diabetic subject metabolic syndrome . In order accomplish integrate proposal , formulate research team include endocrinologist , cardiologist , radiologist , data center , coordinate PhD researcher ( infra-structure described ) . We recruit 40 non-diabetic individual metabolic syndrome ( fulfil criterion IDF , 2006 DOH Taiwan ) . Twenty-five age , sex match non-diabetes lean serve control . Written inform consent obtain subject enrol study approval IRB Taichung VGH , Taichung , Taiwan . This weight reduction program assist experienced dietician sport expert , collaborate publish article previously . This program last 12-16 week every participant join together course 4 hour per week . Each participant introduce dietary plan base caloric reduction 1200 Kcal/day value think necessary maintain usual weight . Subject ask follow dietary advice eat habit review dietician time weekly visit . Activity level encourage reach 30 min day least 5 day week . During visit , weight participant record announce . Meals replacement may consider get much improvement weekly monitoring since recent report indicate meal replacement may provide certain help reduce body weight . We confident adequate weight reduction ( least 5 % initial weight ) good compliance achieve give previous experience . In aggregate , study investigate effect weight loss ( 1 ) Rho kinase activity obtain peripheral leukocyte ( 2 ) . Aortic stiffness , central aortic pressure hemodynamic noninvasive technique ( 3 ) Brain function specifically reflect circulate BDNF level ( 4 ) . Aortic elastic property leave ventricular function use MRI examination , non-diabetic individual metabolic syndrome . Findings integrate proposal provide valuable information mild moderate weight loss ( 5 % initial body weight ) cellular , cardiac central nervous system additional well-known effect lipid , inflammatory cytokine insulin resistance non-diabetic subject metabolic syndrome . Follow up- Subjects receive physical check , fast blood test OGTT 6 12 month end study .</detailed_description>
