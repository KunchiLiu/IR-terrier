	<brief_summary>Although conventional risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) identify routinely use determine risk CHD general population , systematic approach determine population-specific risk CHD perform prospectively SCI . CHD lead cause death spinal cord injury , occur young age able-bodied population . Conventional risk factor CHD high serum concentration low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , low serum concentration high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , positive smoking history , positive family history premature CHD . Coronary calcification ( CAC ) commonly occur phenomenon necessarily indicate significant obstructive disease . Studies show strong association exist coronary calcification coronary heart disease . The purpose study compare CAC score person SCI historical control group able-bodied person national data base match conventional risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) determine relationship CAC score conventional emerge risk factor CAD .</brief_summary>
