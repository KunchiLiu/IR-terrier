	<brief_title>Training Clinicians Motivational Interviewing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New evidence-based treatment slow adopt routine practice addiction treatment , traditional training method limit effectiveness . In study , propose continue development method train clinician Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) , base principle live supervision . Live supervision ( supervisor trainee see patient together ) common basic training , rarely use continue education . In initial funding period develop Teleconference Supervision ( TCS ) , implement live supervision expert teleconferencing technology , harness principle context-dependent learning , differential reinforcement immediacy feedback , model . Clinicians interview standard patient home clinic , Supervisors listen via telephone . The clinician wear earpiece , Supervisor provide immediate feedback coaching design differentially reinforce shape MI skill . In randomized controlled trial community clinician ( N= 100 ) , TCS produce superior overall MI skill , compare control condition clinician receive Workshop training , standard tape-based supervision . Findings encourage yet proportion clinician achieve expert proficiency limit , trend toward loss skill follow-up , suggest longer train need maximize sustain MI skill . In new funding period , propose build improve upon TCS test extend model Teleconference Supervision ( TCS-Plus ) , preserve element live supervision expert supervisor also provide 4 session enhance tape review supervision bi-weekly basis initial TCS training . Using telephone technology , enhance tap review allow Supervisor Clinician listen tap session together discuss session . Practice session increase 5 9 spread 8 16 week . Providing TCS enhance tape review supervision maximize supervision style advantage . While offer context dependent learning , TCS provide model differential reinforcement immediacy feedback , enhance tape review provide ample time role play discus technique . TCS-Plus compare standard Tape Review supervision . The propose project StageI trial , intent maximize gain already detect TCS model . We assess TCS-Plus produce superior MI skill standard Tape Review supervision randomize trial 130 community based-clinicians . It hop , successful , TCS-Plus could model remote train supervision community treatment program , promote adoption variety evidence-based treatment substance use disorder routine practice .</detailed_description>
