	<brief_summary>Dialysis patient usually peripheral muscle weakness due metabolic disturbance ( increase protein catabolism ) fatigue . This muscle weakness may decrease functional capacity quality life . It also serve increase cardiovascular risk factor end stage renal disease patient . Peripheral muscle strength train shall combat physical inactivity dialysis . In investigator trial , investigator hypothesis peripheral muscle training might regulate protein catabolic rate , renal function , cardiovascular risk factor , improve functional capacity quality life endstage renal disease patient undergoing dialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance Training Intradialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End stage renal failure patient undergoing dialysis profound muscle wasting , reduce functional capacity quality life due uremia , steroid , frequent dialysis fatigue . During dialysis , physical inactivity deteriorate patient 's functional capacity . Aerobic strength training may combat physical inactivity . It may also improve functional capacity quality life . Recent study claim benefit resistance exercise improve functional capacity . But documented effect kidney function ( electrolyte urea kinetics ) muscle waste ( protein catabolic rate ) . In trial , attempt study effect resistance train improvement renal function muscle waste apart functional capacity quality life dialysis patient</detailed_description>
