	<brief_summary>Background : - Individuals schizophrenia significantly likely smoke general population , lead increase smoking-related illness high rate nicotine dependence . Research suggest high rate smoke nicotine addiction people schizophrenia relate fact nicotine temporally improve performance several cognitive task , include sensory gating , long-term memory , visual tracking-all affect schizophrenia . - Smoking among schizophrenia patient may form self-medication , since nicotine may temporarily treat improve cognitive deficit cause schizophrenia . Researchers interested study effect nicotine brain activity individual schizophrenia good understand nicotine affect brain region connect memory , visual tracking , attention . Objectives : - To identify specific brain region involve anticipatory learn deficit find schizophrenia patient smoke . - To determine whether nicotine enhances performance region . Eligibility : - Smokers ( least 10 cigarette per day ) 18 50 year age either healthy volunteer diagnose schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder . Design : - Participants ask avoid consume alcohol restrict consuming caffeinated beverage 24 hour study day . Participants provide urine breath sample start study test chemical may interfere study . - The study require two four visit , two fMRI session visit clinical interview training . Participants train session possible mock MRI scan learn task track eye movement measure ability pay attention . - During fMRI scanning session , participant receive either nicotine patch placebo patch without nicotine . After patch place , participant perform task receive MRI scan . The scan take 2 hour . - Participants provide blood sample finish MRI session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>fMRI Study Nicotinic Effect Neurophysiology Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence rate smoking among schizophrenia patient high 88 percent . This associated 2-fold increase death due smoke related diseases-compounded high rate nicotine dependence low abstinence rate follow cessation program . Converging line evidence suggest high rate smoke nicotine addiction among schizophrenic patient influence presence disease-related abnormality brain function . Genetic post mortem study show patient exhibit abnormality neuronal nicotinic receptor , involve number cognitive function . Pharmacological study show nicotine temporally improve performance several cognitive task include sensory gating , long-term memory , visual tracking . These data support grow consensus smoking among schizophrenic patient form self-medication , suggest success target smoke cessation program depend , part , find alternative mean treat underlie cognitive deficit . One reproducible neurocognitive biological change schizophrenia abnormal visual tracking , smooth pursuit eye movement . Preliminary data show previously report deficit visual tracking related anticipatory learn deficit nicotine enhances performance patient temporarily treat learn deficit . A good understanding process may lead good behavioral and/or pharmacological therapeutic intervention excessive nicotine abuse recidivism clinically vulnerable population . In order identify brain region underlie learn deficit propose compare brain activation 30 healthy control 30 patient schizophrenia anticipation target motion use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . In order identify brain region involve nicotine-induced enhancement anticipatory learn compare activation patient condition unexpected anticipate target motion follow administration nicotine placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects ( schizophrenia patient healthy control smoker ) must age 1850 good health base history physical exam . Age restriction base agerelated decline ( usually occur age 5558 ) eye track performance . Schizophrenia patient person DSMIV AxisI diagnosis schizophrenia , base bestestimate diagnosis Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV ( SCID ) supplement family informant medical record , do MPRC . Those nicotine protocol must demonstrate experienced user base upon exhaled CO must smoke minimum 10 cigarettes/day duration use least 1 year . Subjects may users alcohol and/or marijuana may meet criterion dependence either may use either least 24 hour prior scan . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude unable undergo MRI scan due pregnancy , implant metallic device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part ) claustrophobia . Subjects also exclude 1 ) major medical illness include , limited , uncontrolled high blood pressure high blood sugar , cardiovascular disease , asthma , peripheral vascular disease , coagulopathies , history superficial deep vein thrombosis , HIV , infectious disease ( e.g . Hepatitis B ) , 2 ) mood anxiety disorder , substanceinduced psychiatric disorder , 3 ) neurological illness include , limited , seizure disorder , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history head trauma , CVA , CNS tumor , condition cause neurocognitive sequela , 4 ) significant alcohol drug use , nicotine dependence , 5 ) T1 weight image reveal gross structural abnormality and/or , 6 ) history syncope . Urine pregnancy test perform female volunteer childbearing age experimental session . Subjects positive drug nicotine marijuana exclude . Subjects nicotine protocol may actively seek engage smoke cessation treatment . If subject require change antipsychotic medication exacerbation psychotic symptom , subject consider clinically unstable his/her participation discontinue . Patients AxisI mood disorder substanceinduced psychiatric disorder exclude . We also exclude patient significant alcohol illicit drug use , nicotine dependence . This operationally define SCID/DSMIV AxisI substance dependence past 6 month , current substance abuse . Exceptions occasional use marijuana .</criteria>
