	<brief_summary>We propose evaluate use Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) patient undergone Video-Assisted Thoracotomy Surgery ( VATS ) aim determine : - Nurses able apply TENS effectively timely manner post VATS patient . - Use TENS immediately thoracic surgery first 48 hour add patient 's pain control . - Tens reduce medication use . - Tens reduce nausea vomiting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Postoperative Pain After Video-Assisted Thoracotomy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Video-Assisted Thoracotomy ( VATS ) patient 's post procedure pain significant problem may delay recovery thoracic surgery patient . Without adequate control pain , patient 's mobilization ability participate bronchial hygiene compromise increase risk pulmonary complication inhibit body 's natural healing ability . When acute post VATS pain poorly control , incidence chronic post VATS pain six month longer surgery increase . Post-operative pain control largely use pain medication deliver variety route include : epidural , intravenous , able , oral . Medications use include opioids side effect nausea , dizziness , drowsiness constipation may delay patient 's recovery prolong hospital stay . Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) method pain relief use cutaneously apply electrode deliver electrical signal peripheral nerve intact skin . Treating pain TENS result patient reduce perception pain . The effectiveness TENS base two mechanism : 1 ) gate control theory pain relief stimulation myelinated sensory fiber disrupt neuronal processing substantia gelatinosa spinal cord , 2 ) stimulation-induced release endogenous opioids , central nervous system general circulation . The present practice obtain apply TENS unit patient pain relief require consultation Physical Therapy come assess patient apply TENS unit make recommendation setting therapy . This process limit response daytime often result delay initiation treatment . After provide education training anticipated nurse could successfully apply TENS unit initiate therapy early immediate post operative period . The timely application TENS unit post VATS patient could improve pain management outcomes population . Patient 's primary area postoperative pain determine nursing personnel . Four electrode place around area maximum pain nurse train TENS therapy . The TENS unit turn , 1 5 frequency pattern select impulse turned patient could feel impulse . The 5 program option available include : # 1 . Alternate Ramped Burst ( ARB ) ( Rate = 100 pps ; Ramp Up Time = 0.5s ; On Time = 5 ; Off Time = 6 ) . # 2 . Simple Modulated Pulse ( SMP ) ( Rate = 125 pps ; Cycle Time = 12 ; Span Percentage = 40 % ; Rate stay 2-10 pps range 1/3 cycle time ( 4 second ) rate modulates 2 pulse per second ( pps ) back . # 3 . Modulated Amplitude ( MA ) ( Rate = 125 pps ; Cycle Time = 1 ; Span Percentage = 60 % ) . # 4 . Simple Modulated Pulse ( SMP ) ( Rate = 125 pps ; Cycle Time = 12 ; Span Percentage = 40 % ; Rate stay 2-10 pps range 1/3 cycle time ( 4 second ) rate modulates 2 pulse per second ( pps ) back ) . # 5 Modulated Amplitude , MA ( Rate = 125 pps ; Cycle Time = 1 ; Span Percentage = 60 % ) . The location electrode , pattern , and/or intensity TENS unit adjust patient achieve maximum comfort sensation . Five minute initiation TENS therapy every hour - patient awake- total 48 hour , patient reassess nursing staff TENS setting adjust patient comfort pain control .</detailed_description>
