	<brief_summary>Research DXA show pattern bone remodelling around implant . The baseline reference value calculation first measurement operation . The baseline measurement perform different time study study . If rapid bone loss first week operation , influence reference value result . To evaluate DXA method decide set study 3 DXA measurement within first 2 week . Our hypothesis rapid bone loss first 2 week operation time first post operative measurement influence later result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Early Bone Loss Around Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) become used proven precise method investigate change bone mass density ( BMD ) . Research DXA show pattern bone remodelling around implant . Results implant study often present change BMD function time . The baseline reference value calculation first measurement operation . The pronounced bone loss implantation hip prosthesis usually come within 3 month . The baseline measurement perform different time study study . If rapid bone loss first week operation , influence reference value result . To evaluate DXA method decide set study 3 DXA measurement within first 2 week . We include 23 patient operated total hip prosthesis ( THP ) . They measure DXA 1 , 5 14 day , 3 12 month operation . Results give percent ( +/-SD ) Gruen zone . There change bone density first 3 measurement . In zone , except zone 1 , low BMD measure 3 month . We conclude DXA measurement do within 14 day operation use reference measurement later follow ups .</detailed_description>
