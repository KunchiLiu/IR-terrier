	<brief_title>SIDAMI - Sildenafil Diastolic Dysfunction After Acute Myocardial Infarction ( AMI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) characterize regional myocardial damage may lead systolic diastolic dysfunction subsequent risk leave ventricular ( LV ) remodeling , local systemic neurohormonal activation , vascular dysfunction development heart failure . The pathophysiology prognosis LV systolic dysfunction AMI focus research several decade . Insights study lead several therapeutic intervention improve outcome . In addition depress systolic function , clinical radiographic evidence heart failure consistent powerful predictor outcome patient follow AMI . Pulmonary congestion AMI reflect raise LV filling pressure frequently see appear minor myocardial damage . The pathophysiological mechanism incompletely understood may involve impaired active relaxation myocardium increase LV chamber stiffness , hence , abnormalities diastolic function . Abnormal LV diastolic function especially chamber stiffness increase characterized disproportionate increase filling pressure exercise inadequate increase cardiac output . During ventricular diastole leave atrium act conduit leave ventricle pulmonary vein . Thus case increase filling pressure leave atrial pressure elevate expose pulmonary vascular bed increase pressure . In accordance pulmonary artery pressure frequently increase AMI , even systolic function preserve . Several recent study demonstrate Doppler echocardiographic index suggestive increase filling pressure increase pulmonary arterial pressure associate excess mortality morbidity AMI . The optimal management large group patient unknown , theory lower preload improve cardiac output especially exercise lower pulmonary arterial pressure could relive symptom improve exercise capacity . Sildenafil potent selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor suppress degradation cyclic GMP . In pulmonary bed lead pulmonary vasodilation , addition sildenafil show improve endothelium dependent vasodilation thus augment abnormal vascular tone . In patient systolic heart failure sildenafil demonstrate low pulmonary wedge pressure , improve cardiac index lower pulmonary arterial pressure without cause systemic hypotension . Thus theory sildenafil may beneficial effect patient high risk heart failure . Hypothesis : In patient Doppler echocardiographic sign elevate LV fill pressure despite preserved LV systolic function AMI treatment phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil 40 mg three time daily 9 week compare placebo 1 . Improve rest LV fill cardiac hemodynamics . 2 . Improve exercise capacity . 3 . Improve fill pattern cardiac hemodynamics exercise . Specific aim Primary aim : Among 70 patient recent AMI randomize treatment sildenafil 40 mg three time daily compare placebo 9 week compare 1. mitral filling pattern , diastolic E/e´ ratio leave atrial volume , 2. pulmonary wedge pressure , cardiac index pulmonary artery pressure , rest submaximal exercise . Secondary Aims Among 70 patient recent AMI randomize sildenafil 40 mg three time daily compare placebo compare exercise capacity judge bicycle ergometer test . Among 70 patient recent AMI randomize sildenafil 40 mg three time daily compare placebo compare change NT-pro BNP . Among 70 patient recent AMI randomize sildenafil 40 mg three time daily compare placebo compare change diastolic E/e´ ratio submaximal exercise . Among 70 patient recent AMI randomize sildenafil 40 mg three time daily compare placebo compare regional systolic function assess tissue track . Tertiary aim To assess correlation diastolic E/e ' Doppler assess cardiac index rest exercise pulmonary wedge pressure cardiac index respectively . To assess association exercise capacity diastolic E/e ' , LA volume , nt-proBNP . Among 70 patient recent AMI randomize sildenafil 40 mg three time daily compare placebo compare prevalence atrial arrhythmias 9 week treatment . Methods Design The study prospective single center randomize double blind study . Eligible patient randomize either conventional management sildenafil 4 month ; conventional management placebo treatment . Inclusion criterion - Age &gt; 50 year - Recent AMI ( within 21 day ) define accord ESC/ACC guideline - Doppler echocardiographic sign elevate fill pressure define - diastolic E/e ' ratio &gt; 15 , - diastolic E/e ' ratio 8-15 leave atrial volume index &gt; 32 ml/m2 - Preserved LV systolic function ( EF &gt; 45 % ) - Written inform consent Exclusion criterion - Ongoing myocardial ischemia - Ongoing treatment nitrate . - Poor echocardiographic window - Inability exercise - Permanent atrial fibrillation pace rhythm - Planned coronary artery bypass graft - Other noncardiac condition expect survival less 6 month - Unwilling participate - Known intolerance sildenafil Study procedure In possibly eligible patient screen echocardiography perform hospitalization coronary care unit 2144 3141 HS Rigshospitalet , Denmark . If eligible consent obtain hospitalisation ambulatory exercise Doppler echocardiography simultaneous invasive record pulmonary wedge pressure , pulmonary artery pressure cardiac index 6 min walk test maximal exercise test perform 1 week revascularization . Patients randomize 1 1 fashion placebo sildenafil 20 mg three time daily . If tolerate dosage titrate every 2'nd week outpatient clinic target dose 40 mg three time daily . After 9 week treatment exercise echocardiography 6 min walk test repeat , addition conventional maximal ergometer test perform . Screening echocardiography 2 dimensional echocardiographic obtain parasternal apical window . Pulsed Doppler measurement mitral inflow obtain transducer apical four-chamber view , 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume place tip mitral leaflet diastole . Tissue Doppler imagine mitral annulus obtain apical 4-chamber view 1.5-mm sample volume place medial mitral annulus . All Doppler echocardiographic examination do horizontal sweep set 100 mm/s . At least 3-5 cardiac cycle measure . LA volume obtain apical 4 2 chamber view zoom image leave atrium . Clinically indicted echocardiogram perform echolab may use screen echocardiogram . - Wall motion index semiquantitatively use descend score previously validate . - Maximal left atrial volume measure end-systole use two orthogonal apical view . - From pulse wave mitral inflow signal , peak E wave velocity measure . - From tissue Doppler assessment medial mitral annulus early ( E ' ) diastolic velocity record . Diastolic E/e ' ratio calculate . Resting echocardiography Doppler echocardiography perform GE medical Vivid 7 ultrasound machine single investigator . Images obtain parasternal apical window . M-mode recording do parasternal long-axis view . Pulsed Doppler measurement mitral inflow obtain transducer apical four-chamber view , 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume place tip mitral leaflet diastole . Tissue Doppler imagine mitral annulus obtain apical 4-chamber view 1.5-mm sample volume place medial lateral mitral annulus . All Doppler echocardiographic examination do horizontal sweep set 100 mm/s . At least 3-5 cardiac cycle measure . Finally color cod real time tissue Doppler image acquire apical window , low possible depth small angle . - End-systolic , end-diastolic volume ejection fraction calculate accord Simpson modify biplane method . - Wall motion index semiquantitatively assess accord recommendation American Society Echocardiography . - Maximal left atrial volume measure end-systole use two orthogonal apical view zoom leave atrium . - From pulse wave mitral inflow signal , peak E wave velocity , peak A wave velocity , mitral E-wave deceleration time measure . - From peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity size inferior v. cava pulmonary arterial systolic pressure estimate . - From tissue Doppler assessment medial mitral annulus early ( E ' ) diastolic velocity record .

Exercise echocardiography Exercise echocardiography perform cardiac intensive care unit 2143 . Before exercise Swan Ganz catheter introduce seldinger technique right jugular vein . Simultaneous rest echocardiography pulmonary artery pressure , leave atrial pressure , cardiac index pulmonary wedge pressure record . Patients exercised supine bicycle increase workload 100W increment 25W every 2'nd min . At 100W echocardiography repeat simultaneous assessment pulmonary artery pressure , leave atrial pressure , pulmonary wedge pressure cardiac index . Neurohormonal analysis Prior surgery follow-up visit venous blood sample draw analysis plasma N-terminal proBNP , plasma N-terminal ANP concentration .
