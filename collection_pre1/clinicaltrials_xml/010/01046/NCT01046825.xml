	<detailed_description>1 . This study perform transcriptional profile genome-wide analysis DNA copy number abnormality loss-of-heterozygosity use DNA microarrays child newly diagnose diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) small non-cleaved lymphoma different part world . 2 . This study describe type frequency mutation ARF-HDM2-TP53 pathway , `` non-endemic '' B-cell lymphoma ( United States ) find select geographic region world . 3 . This study describe expression ARF-HDM2-TP53 PUMA-associated pathways B-cell lymphoma ( United States ) find B-cell lymphoma select geographic region world . 4 . This study describe pattern frequency XLP gene mutation present B-cell lymphoma United States select geographic region . 5 . This study describe frequency EBV-positive B-cell lymphoma United States select geographic region world : describe pattern EBV protein gene expression ( e.g. , EBNA 3 ) EBV-positive lymphoma study compare pattern EBV protein gene expression clinical , laboratory outcome data . Secondary Objective : To estimate complete response rate , event-free survival , overall survival rate patient Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) , Burkitt leukemia/B-cell acute leukemia ( B-ALL ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) treat stage-adapted regimen base St. Jude B-cell II protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>St. Jude Participants : 1 . Participant must histologic diagnosis mature B cell lymphoma ( e.g. , Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia , atypical Burkitt lymphoma , diffuse large Bcell lymphoma , mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma , mature Bcell lymphoma NOS ) define WHO classification . 2 . Participant must previously untreated , ( 72 hour steroid and/or emergency radiation ) 3 . Participant must &lt; 22 year age time diagnosis 4 . For Group B participants mediastinal large B cell lymphoma ( MLBCL ) disease ( receive rituximab ) All participant MLBCL assign Group B must hepatitis screen prior enrollment . Participants whose result indicate carrier hepatitis B still treat per Group B NOT receive rituximab . This screening must do eligibility BUT result need prior enrollment : Hepatitis B immunization status ( vaccination Yes No ) HBsAg AntiHBs antibody AntiHBc antibody . All participant must screen prior enrollment . Participants whose result indicate carrier hepatitis B still treat per Group B NOT receive rituximab . 5 . HIV test obtain within 42 day . Participants test positive HIV enrol therapeutic part study , still eligible biology study . 6 . Informed consent must obtain accord St. Jude guideline enrollment study Participants Collaborating Sites Participating Biological Objectives Only : 1 . Participant must histologic diagnosis mature B cell lymphoma ( e.g. , Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia , atypical Burkitt lymphoma , diffuse large Bcell lymphoma , mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma , mature Bcell lymphoma NOS ) define WHO classification 2 . Participant must &lt; 22 year age time diagnosis 3 . Informed consent must obtain local PI his/her designee accord ICH/Good Clinical Practice local guideline enrollment study Participants Collaborating Sites Participating Therapeutic Biological Objectives : 1 .
