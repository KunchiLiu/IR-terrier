	<brief_summary>Hypothesis There difference incidence pin tract infection pin loosen case low extremity external fixators self-drilling schanz pin use without pre-drilling . Primary Objective The primary objective determine whether pre-drilling hole external fixation pin insertion superior pre-drilling hole external fixation pin insertion regard incidence pin tract infection pin loosening . Secondary Objective If difference find two technique , quantify qualify difference . The incidence pin site infection pin loosen general determine also stratify site size pin . An attempt identify risk factor pin site infection make observe effect secondary prognostic factor like mode injury , diabetes , smoking , compartment syndrome , peripheral vascular disease , neurovascular injury . Interobserver reliability grade system pin infection also determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The application external fixation commonly perform emergency procedure orthopaedics temporary stabilization well definitive treatment fracture . External fixation require metal pin place bone either side fracture . The pin connect external frame , thus stabilize fracture . There debate optimal technique insertion pin regard need pre-drill pilot hole prior pin insertion . The technology behind external fixation evolve greatly past thirty year . The original external fixation pin , `` Shanz pin , '' essentially metal rod thread trocar point . A pilot hole need pin capability create hole path bone . Recent advance lead creation self-drilling/self-tapping pin , decrease number step necessary place pin thereby decrease operative time . The external fixators usually place temporary measure allow improvement soft tissue condition definitive open reduction internal fixation . Since many external fixation device place patient critically ill , decrease operative time important . While save operative time essential also important device serf purpose without lead complication short term . The major complication relate external fixation pin site infection pin loosening . The literature clear high temperature create pin insertion lead bone necrosis surround pin , increased infection , increase rate loosen . It unclear new generation self-drilling pin create amount necrosis old generation pin . Lab study show increased temperature direct drilling pin compare pin insertion drilling pilot hole dedicate drill bit . It unclear increased temperature result increase rate loosening pin site infection clinical practice . A thorough literature search reveal randomize controlled study support use pin without drilling pilot hole insertion . The current standard care undefined leave surgeon preference . Our study aim provide guideline schanz pin insertion external fixator application , may help reduce number pin tract infection suffer patient improve outcome . Study Design Treatment Plan This prospective , randomize , within-subject , single-blind trial conduct Temple University Hospital . Patients determine require external fixation procedure low extremity due fracture dislocation consider enrollment accord inclusion criterion . Standard care treatment fracture provide . Once patient provide informed consent enrollment study , pin randomize paired design accord computer generate randomization schedule . There two type pin , pre-drilled non pre-drilled . A standard external fixation device require two pin side fracture . Each pair pin one pre-drilled pre-drilled pin , accord randomization schedule . Therefore , patient two pre-drilled pin two pin insert without pre-drilling . Some surgeon may prefer three pin side fracture/dislocation immobilize . We randomization protocol situation well . The computer generate randomization algorithm place secure location seal opaque envelope . The operating surgeon open envelope prior pin insertion follow randomization schedule prescribe envelope . A standard technique follow . IV antibiotic administer within 60 minute start skin incision . Pin insertion do standard technique . This involve 1 cm incision , blunt dissection . 4.0 mm ( calcaneal metatarsal ) , 5.0 mm ( tibia ) 6.0 mm ( femur ) pin inserted one two technique : ( 1 ) self drill pin inserted power drill directly bone ; ( 2 ) standard twist drill bit utilized power drill create pilot hole , follow insertion self-drilling pin power drill . Soft tissue relaxation incision make accord standard technique external fixation assembly , need . The pin care protocol consist daily pin site clean use dilute hydrogen peroxide dry dressing . Patients suspect pin site infection treat Keflex 500mg po q 6hr . Patients allergy Keflex receive Clindamycin 300mg po q 6hr .</detailed_description>
