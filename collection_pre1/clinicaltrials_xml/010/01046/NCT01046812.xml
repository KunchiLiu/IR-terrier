	<brief_title>Halitosis Devised Questionnaire Evaluating New Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Halitosis common symptom affect people age . It may decrease self confidence social interaction . Oral halitosos consequence microbial ( mainly Gram negative bacteria ) breakdown food debris , cell , saliva , blood . The agent give rise halitosis include especially volatile sulphur compound ( VSC ) , diamine , short chain fatty acid VSC detect clinical setting , make detection halitosis often hard . The common cause oral halitosis poor oral hygiene due gingivitis periodontitis . Other cause include bacterial accumulation posterior tongue , tonsillitis others . Dry mouth implicate potential cause halitosis . Due lack quantitative objective measure severity halitosis especially face subjective nature halitosis occur commonly subjectively measurement necessary . As current QOL exist measurement halitosis formulation questionnaire enable measurement subjective halitosis change observe time intervention . We intend treat halitosis novel approach target mouth dryness- factor rule measure outcome halitosis questionnaire . We treat mouth dryness Caphosol- solution indicate mouth dryness act locally mouth wash . As supersaturated phosphate solution mineral alien body side effect practically negligible . Quality life ( QOL ) questionnaires ( SNOT20- sinonasal outcome test ) common medicine , however questionnaire exists halitosis . We devise specific QOL questionnaire halitosis . This questionnaire consist 20 question cover functional limitation , physical discomfort , psychological discomfort , physical disability social disability . The answer base common scale 5 answer depend severity range never bother symptom symptom worse . Formulation questionnaire assist measure subjective halitosis change observe time intervention . Treating halitosis challenge due multitude factor . However , treatment , mainly form nasal saline irrigation oral solution chlorine base triclosan exist . Mouth dryness , although implicated factor , target yet . Improving salivary flow may reduce stasis saliva thus reduce concentration protein bacteria dwell well good degradation oral food debris . Caphosol topical oral agent supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse indicate dry mouth clinically proven shorten duration severity mucositis relieve dry mouth use fluoride . Caphosol indicate dryness mouth throat ( hyposalivation , xerostomia ) , regardless cause regardless whether condition temporary permanent . Caphosol also indicate adjunct standard oral care treat mucositis may cause radiation high dose chemotherapy . It extremely high safety profile salt alien body , thus swallow accidentally , adverse effect expect . No known drug interaction exist .</detailed_description>
