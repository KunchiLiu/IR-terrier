	<brief_title>Bortezomib , Dexamethasone , Rituximab Previously Untreated Patients With Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia ( WM ) distinct B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterize primarily bone marrow infiltration lymphoplasmacytic cell , along demonstration IgM monoclonal gammopathy . This condition consider correspond lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma define REAL2 WHO classification system . WM rare disease , incidence le frequent multiple myeloma , account approximately 2 % hematologic malignancy . The age-adjusted incidence rate 3.4 per million among male 1.7 per million among female US , geometrical increase age . Despite continuing advance therapy WM , disease remain incurable median survival 5 8 year time diagnosis thereby necessitate development evaluation novel therapeutic . Overall response rate ( ORR ) 30-70 % complete response ( CR ) rate 10 % report use alkylator agent ( e.g . chlorambucil ) , nucleoside analogue ( cladribine fludarabine ) , monoclonal antibody rituximab therapeutic agent upfront therapy WM median duration response average 2-3 year . Higher response rate include CR rate 20 % report study combine nucleoside analogue rituximab , and/or alkylator agent . Importantly , individual patient include presence cytopenia , need rapid disease control , age , particular candidacy autologous transplant therapy take account make choice first line therapy . For patient candidate autologous transplant therapy , therapy seriously consider , exposure alkylator nucleoside analogue therapy limit . Monoclonal antibody successfully use treat patient Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia ( WM ) . Most effort date focus use rituximab , chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody target CD20 , antigen widely express WM . Several study employ standard dose rituximab therapy demonstrate major response ( &gt; 50 % reduction serum IgM ) rate 30 % , duration response 8 months13-17 . More recently , use extend schedule rituximab evaluate . Time response rituximab slow exceed 3 month average . In many patient transient increase serum IgM may occur immediately follow initiation rituximab . Such increase herald treatment failure patient return baseline serum IgM 12 week . However , patient baseline serum IgM level &gt; 50g/L may particularly risk hyperviscosity-related event . Bortezomib small molecule proteasome inhibitor develop Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , ( MPI ) novel agent treat human malignancy . Bortezomib currently approve US FDA European EMEA treatment multiple myeloma . By inhibit single molecular target , proteasome , bortezomib affect multiple signal pathway . The anti-neoplastic effect bortezomib likely involve several distinct mechanism , include inhibition cell growth survival pathway , induction apoptosis , inhibition expression gene control cellular adhesion , migration angiogenesis . Thus , mechanism bortezomib elicit anti-tumor activity may vary among tumor type , extent affect pathway critical inhibition tumor growth could also differ . The mechanism anti-tumor activity NHL known ; however , bortezomib inhibits growth various human lymphoma cell line , well survival primary WM cell . Bortezomib administer patient WM context prospective study . Chen et al administer bortezomib 16 patient either untreated pretreated WM receive ≤3 prior regimen . Six 13 evaluable patient ( 46 % ) achieve partial response . Dimopoulos et al administer bortezomib 10 patient relapsed refractory WM . Six patient achieve partial response occur median 1 month . The median time progression respond patient expect exceed 11months . The common toxicity mild moderate thrombocytopenia , fever fatigue ; peripheral neuropathy occur 3 patient . The WM Clinical Trials Group ( WMCTG ) conduct Phase II Study ( DFCI Protocol 03-248 ) single-agent bortezomib 27 patient relapsed refractory WM . In interim analysis , safety efficacy result 15 patient complete least 2 cycle therapy reported.37 Eight 7 patient relapsed refractory disease , respectively . With median 3 complete cycle ( range 2-8 ) , 12 15 ( 80 % ) patient demonstrate response 5 partial response ( &gt; 50 % decrease serum IgM ) 7 minor response ( &gt; 25 % decrease serum IgM ) observe . Three patient remain stable disease . Therapy generally well tolerate great grade II adverse event follow : neuropathy ( n=3 ; 20 % ) ; neutropenia ( n=3 ; 20 % ) ; thrombocytopenia ( n=1 ; 7 % ) ; rash ( n=1 ; 7 % ) . Adverse event generally reversible return baseline hold dose modify study drug . Bortezomib ( velcade ) combination Rituximab show act synergistically vitro vivo model . Bortezomib plus Rituximab combination use phase 2 clinical study previously treat patient indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients receive either Bortezomib 1,3mg/m2 d1,4,8,11 q21 day ( Group A ) , Bortezomib 1,6mg/m2 weekly d1,8,15,22 q35 day ( Group B ) . Rituximab 375mg/m2 administer weekly 4 week patient . Response rat similar group A B , patient Group B ( weekly bortezomib increase dose ) experience less toxicity . Furthermore , glucocorticoid acte synergistically Rituximab induce apoptosis various malignant NHL B cell line . A single dose dexamethasone administer immediately rituximab adequate synergistic effect . Furthermore , test sequence vivo context prospective trial dexamethasone , rituximab cyclophosphamide previously untreated patient WM . This combination induce response 74 % patient . Based investigate combination bortezomib , dexamethasone rituximab ( BDR ) primary treatment patient WM . The following point importance : A ) Only patient indication treatment include exclude asymptomatic patient . This one multicenter trial design specifically WM patient predefined indication treatment . B ) By avoid stem cell toxic agent , believe able collect adequate number blood stem cell patients≤70 year age . These stem cell could use support high dose therapy time relapse BDR . C ) Our previous experience single agent bortezomib indicate median time response one month . Thus , start treatment bortezomib alone , believe abrogate `` IgM flare '' phenomenon occur almost 50 % patient receive single-agent rituximab . D ) We limit use dexamethasone one dose ( 40mg ) administration rituximab base vitro data . In contrast multiple myeloma , evidence dexamethasone essential treatment WM . Furthermore repetitive administration dexamethasone may associate increase risk opportunistic infection . E ) We plan administer 5 cycle bortezomib order avoid increase incidence neuropathy usually occur exposure bortezomib . Subsequently patient follow treatment evidence progressive disease .</detailed_description>
