	<brief_summary>Background : - Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChRs ) primary target action nicotine . In addition involve tobacco dependence , also involved variety brain disorder , include Alzheimer 's Parkinson 's disease . Researchers interested develop good way study action nAChRs improve treatment smoke cessation problem affect receptor . These new study method may involve different radiotracers , drug help show brain activity positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . Objectives : - To evaluate feasibility use radiotracer , 2- [ 18F ] F-A-85380 , PET scan brain . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 21 45 year age use tobacco . Design : - Participants ask avoid consume alcohol use number over-the-counter medication , include antihistamine , cough medicine , nasal decongestant , 5 day study day . Participants provide urine breath sample start study test chemical may interfere study . - Participants visit clinical center morning day scan session provide blood urine sample require . Participants return admit overnight stay later afternoon evening . - On day study , participant receive single dose radiotracer 2- [ 18F ] F-A-85380 , series PET scan next 7 hour provide blood sample time . Participants spend night clinical center leave morning end study . - Participants return follow-up visit 2 week 1 month end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChRs ) mediate variety brain function implicate pathophysiology Alzheimer 's Parkinson 's disease , CNS disorder ( Tourette 's syndrome , epilepsy , etc . ) , nicotine dependence . These receptor primary target action nicotine , believe cause tobacco dependence . The availability suitable agent could image nAChRs PET human would allow scientist monitor nAChRs vivo purpose determine role pathogenesis neurodegenerative disease nicotine dependence . Scientific Goals : The immediate goal propose study evaluate feasibility use radiotracer , 2- [ 18F ] F-A-85380 , develop scientist NIDA Brain Imaging Center external imaging nAChRs human brain . Study Population : Healthy adult participant , male females 21 45 year age , recruit study . The goal complete study 7 male 7 female subject . Experimental Design Method : After medically clear give informed consent , participant receive single dose radiotracer , 2 [ 18F ] F A 85380-Injection , undergo series PET scan acquire next 7 hour injection . The PET scan use determine time course distribution inject radioactivity organ expect receive high radiation exposure brain . Benefits participant and/or society : This protocol provide direct benefit research participant routine medical screen attention research staff . The knowledge gain study may lead availability agent external monitoring nAChRs use PET . This agent would valuable tool determine role nAChRs pathogenesis neuropsychiatric disease , include nicotine dependence develop medication diseases respond nicotinic agonist . Risks participant : There risk attendant PET scan general , involve exposure radiation , arterial catheterization venous catheterization . In addition , risk relate administration radiopharmaceutical , give human first time study . Medical supervision provide throughout study . A plan monitor potential side effect radiotracer give .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age : Subjects male female volunteer age 21 45 year . All subject must stable point contact must agree return 2 4 week PET study laboratory screen follow evaluation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Psychiatric disease : DSMIV criterion use ( DSMIV , APA , 1994 ) . No subject current axis I diagnosis allow . No subject know claustrophobia allow . 2 . History Drug Abuse : Volunteers report current significant history illicit drug abuse ( single illicit substance use 10 time lifetime give substance , except marijuana ) exclude study . Volunteers report current use nicotine exclude nAChRs usually elevated smoker , purpose protocol determine feasibility measure nAChRs vivo . Including smoker time may provide result variable may overestimate ability measure receptors nonsmoker . Subjects may use moderate amount alcohol caffeine smoke occasional marijuana cigarette . Moderate alcohol use define less ten drink liquor ( 1.5 oz ) equivalent beer ( 12 oz ) wine ( 5 oz ) per week . Moderate caffeine use define less 500 mg caffeine per day , 100 mg equivalent 1 serve coffee ( 5 oz serve ) , 2.5 serving ( 12 oz serve ) caffeinated soft drink , 2.5 serving tea ( 5 oz serve ) . Occasional marijuana use define less equal two marijuana cigarettes/month . 3 . Current Medication Use : Volunteers may currently use chronic ( daily 10/14 day last month ) prescription counter medication , ( include , limited , antihypertensive , antiallergy , pain ) . Over counter prescription medication may use occasional basis ( treatment selflimited condition , occasional headache , musculoskeletal discomfort , allergic symptom pain ) . All medication discontinue least 5 day experimental session . 4 . CNS disease : History know structural brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasm , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , history head trauma ( define document loss consciousness &gt; 5 min injury require hospitalization ) , history seizure adult , sleep apnea . 5 . Cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic disease : Repeated ( measure three separate occasion ) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg , systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg , know arrhythmia , symptomatic know coronary artery disease ; history endocarditis , cerebral embolism , obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , active tuberculosis , know endocrine disease ( derangement adrenal , thyroid , bone reproductive function ) know chronic renal hepatic dysfunction , know HIV seropositive , know current autoimmune disease involve CNS , type I diabetes mellitus , current gastrointestinal disease , gastritis ulcer . 6 . Special consideration female subject . Female participant currently pregnant nursing allow participate study . Female subject give serum pregnancy test ( quantitative beta HCG ) within 24 hour PET session . 7 . Miscellaneous exclusionary criterion : Body mass index less 20 great 29 . Hematocrit &lt; 39.0 male &lt; 35.0 female . 8 . Radiation exposure : Any subject participate research study he/she receive radiation exposure would result combination present study , total effective radiation exposure ( research study ) exceed 3.0 rem 13week period 5.0 rem year . 9 . Novocain allergy . 10 . Test hand cubital artery patency subject . 11 . Women pregnant lactate child age 21 exclude avoid unnecessary exposure radiation population . 12 . The presence within body metallic implant material could move magnet MRI scanner : pacemaker , surgical implant , aneurysm clip , dental brace , bullet ( ) metallic material .</criteria>
