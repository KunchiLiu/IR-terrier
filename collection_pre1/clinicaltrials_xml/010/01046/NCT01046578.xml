	<brief_summary>A single center , open label randomize clinical trial design examine ovarian follicular dynamic follow attempted atresia induction late follicular early luteal phase menstrual cycle use aromatase inhibitor . We hypothesize administration aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) biologically important time natural menstrual cycle cause ovulatory failure woman preovulatory follicle failure luteogenesis woman recently ovulate . It propose atresia dominant follicle formation anovulatory structure associate arrested endometrial development shorten interval menstrual bleeding ( 3 day ) . We anticipate provide u information facilitate development new method emergency contraception great understanding human folliculogenesis . The rationale propose research project base ovarian synchronization concept develop documented bovine model Reproductive Science Medicine Research group University Saskatchewan combine novel human ovarian wave concept folliculogenesis first elucidate Women 's Health Imaging Research Laboratory ( WHIRL ) Department Obstetrics , Gynecology Reproductive Sciences .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In clinical practice emergency contraception ( EC ) intend suppress follicular development , ovulation , ability conceptus implant . Exogenous steroid , estrogen progestin , use various formulation accomplish suppression . Though EC available 'over-the-counter ' Canada many country around world ; ovarian response unpredictable EC inhibit ovulation critical time menstrual cycle . In 2002 approximately 120,000 450,000 pregnancy Canada end elective pregnancy termination . In US 49 % 3.5 million annual pregnancy unintended 54 % unintended pregnancy result elective termination . Current hormonal contraceptive regimen , pre post coital , base traditional theory follicular development state single group antral follicle recruit late luteal phase growth . Recent documentation show human ovarian folliculogenesis occur 2-3 wave like pattern menstrual cycle . Wave emergence document occur early luteal phase final wave ovulatory . The new model follicular wave dynamic well establish support experimental evidence bovine equine model . Traditionally hormonal medication take 72 120 hour know suspected barrier contraception failure unprotected intercourse . The two standard steroidal EC method Plan BTM , contain 0.75 mg levonorgestrel ( LNG ) , Yuzpe method , contain 0.1 mg ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) 0.5 mg LNG . Ovarian follicular development ovulation woman study EC use ; however , mechanism underlie follicular growth , regression , ovulation EC use remain poorly elucidate . The mechanism action differs EC regimen well dependent upon relative timing dosing , intercourse , ovulation . Previous study show EC effective use dominant follicle diameter small ( 4 5 day prior ovulation ) , however , time interval intercourse less likely result pregnancy whether EC administer . All current emergency contraception ( EC ) option guide traditional theory follicular development . Based finding unpredictable response ovary EC treatment , occurrence ovulation treatment EC , finding follicle growth 2-3 wave pattern , need reconsider phase menstrual cycle treatment give emergency contraception . Aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) prevent enzymatic conversion androgens estrogen . This significantly lower serum estrogen level . AI administer around time menses ovulation induction ovulation see follow 10 12 day later . The rationale induce atresia dominant follicle stem observation . Acute estradiol deprivation theoretically initiate atresia viable follicle cohort result emergence new follicle wave without ovulation event occur .</detailed_description>
