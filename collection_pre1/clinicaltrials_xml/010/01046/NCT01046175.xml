	<brief_summary>Respiratory complication continue one leading cause morbidity mortality people spinal cord injury , especially among cervical high thoracic injury . Both inspiratory expiratory function often severely decrease , lead respiratory complication , atelectasis , pneumonia ventilatory failure . The prevention respiratory complication need begin immediately injury . To achieve effective expel secretion form mucus plug , essential improve patient ability cough . Manually assist cough one way increase cough flow , effective cough also require adequate lung volume . The emphasis therefore expansion lung cough . One way expand lung air-stacking . In air-stacking insufflation stack lung maximally expand . Cough value measure Peak Cough Flow ( PCF ) . By combine air-stacking manually assist cough PCF increase sufficiently . The aim study compare effect two different air-stacking technique PCF , air-stacking respirator versus air-stacking manual resuscitator .</brief_summary>
