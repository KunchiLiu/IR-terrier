	<brief_summary>The patient pediatric haemato-oncology high risk novel H1N1 influenza infection general population , strongly recommend receive novel H1N1 vaccination . However , previous data answer efficacy effectiveness novel H1N1 vaccination patient pediatric haemato-oncology . This study design investigate antibody titer novel H1N1 influenza vaccination patient . Titer H1N1 influenza virus antibody determine hemagglutinin inhibition assay ( HAI ) . A HAI titer 4-fold rise great define seroconversion . Study subject seroconversion regard responsiveness vaccination . Meanwhile , patient present influenza-like symptom , perform throat swab nasal swab influenza rapid test , viral isolation , novel H1N1 influenza PCR confirm diagnosis . After study , able know whether current novel H1N1 influenza vaccination schedule adequate efficient pediatric haemato-oncology patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibody Titer Analysis After H1N1 Vaccination Pediatric Haemato-oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence novel H1N1 influenza 2009 great impact society Taiwan worldwide . The patient pediatric haemato-oncology high risk novel H1N1 influenza infection general population , strongly recommend receive novel H1N1 vaccination . However , previous data answer efficacy effectiveness novel H1N1 vaccination patient pediatric haemato-oncology . This study design investigate antibody titer novel H1N1 influenza vaccination patient . Thus two blood sample draw . The first sample collect vaccination second one collect three week vaccination ( If patient young 9 year old , third sample collect three week booster vaccination ) . Titer H1N1 influenza virus antibody determine hemagglutinin inhibition assay ( HAI ) . A HAI titer 4-fold rise great define seroconversion . Study subject seroconversion regard responsiveness vaccination . We analyze seroconversion rate well . Meanwhile , patient present influenza-like symptom , perform throat swab nasal swab influenza rapid test , viral isolation , novel H1N1 influenza PCR confirm diagnosis . After study , able know whether current novel H1N1 influenza vaccination schedule adequate efficient pediatric haemato-oncology patient .</detailed_description>
