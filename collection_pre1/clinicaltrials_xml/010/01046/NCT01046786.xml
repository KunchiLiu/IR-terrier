	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility Umbilical Cord Blood Cell Transplant Into Injured Spinal Cord</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose-escalating clinical trial . Three group four patient receive transplant increase dos HLA-matched umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell spinal cord . In fourth group , transplant high volume cell increase neurological deficit along single bolus 30mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate . In fifth group four subject , inject volume cell plus bolus intravenous dose 30mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate 6-week course oral lithium carbonate titrate 0.6-1.0 mM serum level . All subject encourage stand walk one hour day cell transplantation . The neurological walking outcome assess 1 , 2 , 6 , 24 48 week transplantation . The outcomes five treatment group compare analysis variance , possible , correlation cell dose . Efficacy safety analyze comparing neurological change score amongst five different treatment group . Loss motor ( &gt; 5 point ) sensor score ( &gt; 2 point ) baseline pre-treatment level would consider deleterious . Increases score baseline would consider beneficial .</detailed_description>
