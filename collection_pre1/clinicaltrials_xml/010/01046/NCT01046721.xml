	<brief_summary>Exenatide new drug lower blood sugar ( glucose ) level people type 2 diabetes . It significant advantage treatment insulin cause weight loss group people generally overweight . Data study involve exenatide show also effect blood pressure . The mechanism blood pressure lower effect know investigate previously . Exenatide may effect blood vessel throughout body gut reduce blood pressure . 12 healthy men ( 18-45yr ) study 2 occasion . Limb blood flow , skin blood flow , gut blood flow , blood pressure , heart rate measure half hourly 4 hour . Blood sample ( 3ml ) insulin glucose determination take via cannula 3-way tap time point . A dose either 5μg exenatide saline inject skin abdomen breakfast provide study . A urine collection make duration study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Looking Cardiovascular Effects Exenatide , Its Blood Pressure Lowering Effect Its Mechanisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) incretin hormone secrete L-cells gut follow meal ( 1 ) . GLP-1 multiple mode action , include augment usual rise insulin release decrease glucagon follow carbohydrate ingestion ( 2 ) . GLP-1 therefore play part glucose homeostasis . GLP-1 secretion reduce patient type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) extended-action GLP-1 agonist mimetics currently introduce use glucose lowering medication . The peptide exendin-4 considerable homology GLP-1 resistant degradation enzyme Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-IV ) much long duration action . The synthetic exendin , 'Exenatide ' , novel GLP-1 mimetic recently license treatment T2DM show effective glucoregulatory agent administer twice- daily subcutaneous injection ( 11 ) . GLP-1 agonist give low risk significant hypoglycaemia effect insulin glucagon largely glucose-dependent . In addition , considerable weight loss often observe GLP-1 agonist clinical practice , drug currently consider treat obesity , even outside context diabetes . A moderate blood-pressure ( BP ) lower effect GLP-1 agonist also note secondary outcome measure large clinical trial patient T2DM . In one study , Exenatide associate reduction systolic/diastolic BP 5/2 mmHg The mechanism apparent hypotensive effect know . An infusion GLP-1 agonist induces natriuresis , may contribute reduction BP . Aims : The aim study ass cardiovascular effect Exenatide young , healthy , non-obese male subject . We propose compare effect Exenatide vs. placebo study cardiovascular effect number non invasive technique . Experimental protocol method : 12 healthy male subject age 18-45 year BMI 20-27 kg/m2 recruit . Subjects attend initial screen visit initial assessment . This enable familiarization room equipment use . On arrival laboratory , subject ask void bladder urine collection commence . Subjects ask wear short study rest semi-supine hospital bed . They place hand heat hand warm unit intravenous cannula insert , arterialize venous blood sampling , . Subjects rest 1hour receive either Exenatide placebo injection . Measurements Limb blood flow ( venous occlusion plethysmography ) ; skin blood flow ( laser Doppler ) ; blood pressure , heart rate ( HR ) cardiac output ( Finometry™ ) ; regional blood flow ( ultrasound imaging flow velocity measurement superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) take place every 30minutes . Blood sample insulin glucose carry every 15minutes throughout study . Subjects rest 120 minute injection measurement every 30 minute blood sample every 15 minute 120 minute post injection . Subjects receive high carbohydrate breakfast 60 minute post injection . Urine collect study ass urinary sodium excretion . Measurable end points/statistical power study : Our primary end point measure meal induce change superior mesenteric ( SMA ) blood flow 2 group ( Exenatide vs . placebo . ) Secondary endpoint measure include : BP , HR , Limb Blood Flow , Skin Blood Flow , peripheral resistance response fast eating- ( Exenatide placebo group ) . From previous study calculate SMA blood flow rest = 346 ( 27 ) ml/min peak SMA blood flow high carbohydrate meal = 611 ( 80 ) ml/min . With 12 subject , reduction blood flow 71ml/min , follow Exenatide injection , would require powered 80 % .</detailed_description>
