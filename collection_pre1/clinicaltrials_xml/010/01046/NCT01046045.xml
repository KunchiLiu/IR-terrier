	<brief_summary>Despite remarkable improvement short-term patient graft survival among recipient kidney transplant , progressive renal dysfunction ( chronic allograft dysfunction ) accompany chronic interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy , vascular occlusive change glomerulosclerosis remain chief cause graft loss . As result damage immunologic non-immunologic injury , long-term survival kidney transplant change little past decade . And , among non-immunologic factor , calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity show common factor lead long-term graft damage progression graft failure . This support previous find long-term use calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy lead deterioration kidney function , even recipients non-renal organ transplant . The grow interest calcineurin inhibitor minimisation protocol optimize renal transplant outcome offer new therapeutic option management patient chronic allograft dysfunction . Recently , mammalian target-of-rapamycin inhibitor ( mTOR inhibitor ) include everolimus show achieve improvement long-term function early modulation immunosuppressive regimen . In aspect , percutaneous renal graft biopsy represent important diagnostic tool allow visualization lesion chronic allograft dysfunction therefore ability delineate potential improvement introduction everolimus . Histologic morphometric finding protocol-mandated biopsy obtain renal transplant recipient suffer chronic allograft dysfunction treat everolimus need provide clinical blueprint drug 's efficacy , confirm .</brief_summary>
