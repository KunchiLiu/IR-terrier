	<brief_summary>Patients Intensive Care Units often extremely thirsty due medicine , illness , treatment medicine receive . This study test whether patient receive easy implement intervention thirst great relief thirst group patient receive intervention . The study also identify important factor make ICU patient thirsty future research study test relieve factor and/or make intervention thirst readily available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study test efficacy innovative , inexpensive , resource-efficient treatment thirst -- one pervasive , intense , unrecognized , under-treated symptom suffer critically ill patient Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) . The first aim single-blinded , randomized clinical trial test non-pharmacologic intervention thirst ICU patient . The intervention combination therapy treatment ( CTT ) thirst include use sterile water mouth spray , sterile water swab , menthol-based lip tongue moisturizer . The second aim study examine demographic , environmental , health illness factor increase ICU patient 's risk profile thirst . Aim # 1 hypothesis : ( 1 ) Thirst intensity distress decrease significantly ICU patient receive CTT thirst compare receive research team observation . ( 2 ) Subjective ( e.g. , dry mouth ) objective ( e.g. , cracked lip ) thirst-related characteristic decrease significantly ICU patient receive CCT thirst compare receive research team observation . Aim # 2 hypothesis : ( 1 ) A significant association find presence thirst certain risk factor thirst , e.g. , serum osmolality , hydration status , administration certain medication , e.g. , opioids . ( 2 ) A significant association find intensity thirst certain risk factor thirst , e.g. , serum osmolality , hydration status , administration certain medication , e.g. , opioids . The sample 245 ICU patient one Experimental two Control group . Those thirst randomize either Experimental Control 1 group . The Experimental group receive CTT ; Control 1 group receive research team observation . The Control 2 group patient report thirst compare Control 1 group characteristic associate presence intensity thirst . Multilevel linear regression model employ test difference linear change trajectory treatment control group . Multiple logistic regression analysis multiple linear regression analysis use determine association risk factor presence intensity thirst , respectively . Results contribute empirical data need stimulate far overdue nursing practice change treatment thirst ICUs . Results also identify risk profile thirst important target future research thirst ICU patient .</detailed_description>
