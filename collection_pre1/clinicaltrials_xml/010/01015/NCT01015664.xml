	<brief_summary>This study accrue two `` phase '' . During first `` phase '' study , optimal dose temsirolimus combination cisplatin cetuximab determine . It expect 9-12 patient need dose finding phase . Once optimal dose determine , additional 41 patient enrol second `` phase '' study . The primary purpose second phase study learn effect , good and/or bad , temsirolimus combination cisplatin cetuximab recurrent metastatic head neck cancer . Collection additional blood tissue specimen make possible special test , provide u information tumor respond chemotherapy , body break process drug , difference genetic makeup person affect drug may work process body , drug affect proteins cell body . We hope determine result specialized test do blood help predict patient likely benefit use drug use study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Cisplatin , Cetuximab Temsirolimus Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) pathway key molecular pathway pathogenesis SCCHN . Cetuximab , therapy target EGFR pathway , show great promise SCCHN . The EXTREME study find combine cetuximab regimen cisplatin 5-fluorouracil , PFS could extend 5.6 month 3.3 month , overall survival increase 10.1 month versus 7.4 month . While study prove survival benefit addition cetuximab , high rate Grade 3 4 toxicity chemotherapy backbone high dose cisplatin 5-fluorouracil . The mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway activated condition favor cellular growth proliferation . The PI3K-Akt pathway one key modulators activation mTOR . Phosphorylated Akt detect majority SCCHN tumor immunohistochemistry . Temsirolimus mTOR inhibitor show synergistic effect cisplatin carboplatin tumor model . Due minimal toxicity associate temsirolimus clinical study date , ideal agent use combination chemotherapy . There limited experience combination EGFR inhibitor mTOR inhibitor human subject . These agent combine suggest synergistic effect preclinical model colon cancer xenograft cell line non-small cell lung , pancreas , colon , breast cancer . Cetuximab safely combine everolimus ( oral mTOR inhibitor ) human subject . There sufficient evidence suggest addition mTOR inhibitor , temsirolimus , may increase cytotoxicity see platinum-based chemotherapy well augment effect EGFR pathway inhibition cetuximab , possibly provide clinical benefit . It hypothesize combination cisplatin , cetuximab , temsirolimus effective , well tolerated regimen patient R/M SCCHN .</detailed_description>
