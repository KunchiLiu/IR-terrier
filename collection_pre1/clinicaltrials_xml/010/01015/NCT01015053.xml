	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain After Pediatric Umbilical Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study adult patient ' perception hospital care show improvement need pain management ( Jha , Orav , Zheng , Epstein ) . The use regional anesthetic technique block specific peripheral nerve adult patient increase recent decade alternative general anesthesia decrease opioid use surgery . Decreased postoperative complication observe , few ambulatory patient require prolonged recovery room stay and/or costly unplanned hospital admission ( Chan , Peng , Kaszas , Middleton , Muni , Anastakis , Graham ) . Regional anesthetic technique widely perform pediatric patient challenge require child report paresthesias needle placement . However , pediatric anesthesiologist recently begin use ultrasound identify anatomy , guide needle insertion local anesthetic infiltration , thereby enable peripheral nerve block perform safely child general anesthesia . Several study illustrate umbilical nerve block ( Jose Maria , GÃ¶tzens , Mabrok ) rectus sheath block ( Willschke , Bosenberg , Marhofer , Johnston , Kettner , Wanzel , Kapral ) use safely effectively ultrasound guidance pediatric outpatient surgery . To date , study explore whether ultrasound-guided regional block abdomen child desire outcome reduce postoperative pain and/or decrease opioid use . The use ultrasound guide deposition local anesthetic posterior sheath rectus muscle contain peripheral nerve innervate abdomen may decrease postoperative pain , opioid non-opioid analgesic consumption , well minimize opioid-related complication . Currently , Children 's Hospital Boston , common regimen pain control umbilical hernia repair perform general anesthesia ( i.e . standard care ) surgeon-administered nonspecific local anesthetic infiltration wound conclusion surgery , follow opioids Post-Anesthesia Care Unit oral opioid/acetaminophen combination post-discharge . In sporadic case past year , several pediatric surgeon collaborate anesthesiologist pain service allow ultrasound-guided bilateral rectus sheath block perform patient undergo umbilical hernia repair , usually prior surgical repair , often concomitantly surgeon-administered local anesthetic infiltration wound . Because anecdotal nature practice , specific conclusion regard improvement post-operative pain decrease need post-operative opioid use drawn . However , anecdotal report parent time outpatient post-operative follow-up visit encourage regard perceived success achieve adequate post-operative pain control patient receive regional block . We propose interdisciplinary , prospective , randomize , single-blinded clinical trial use ultrasound-guided bilateral rectus sheath block versus local anesthetic infiltration pediatric population patient undergo ambulatory umbilical hernia repair Children 's Hospital Boston Children 's Hospital Boston Waltham .</detailed_description>
