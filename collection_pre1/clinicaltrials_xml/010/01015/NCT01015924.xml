	<brief_title>Plate Osteosynthesis Versus ESIN Displaced Midclavicular Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clavicular fracture one common fracture , account 4 % fracture . Midshaft fracture account approximately 80 % . Traditionally , midshaft fracture think good prognosis even substantially displace , treat nonoperatively sling figure eight bandage . Early study Neer Rowe 60´s demonstrate low non-union rate , av prevalence 4 series 566 patient , 3 nonunions 2235 another . On basis , general view vast majority even severely displaced midshaft fracture heal uneventfully , low nonunion rate good functional result . Operative result report hand bad result , especially concern risk infection . Recent study , however , conclude differently , suggest outcomes displaced fracture might favourable think . Hill show series 52 completely displaced midclavicular fracture nonunion rate 15 % ( 8 52 patient ) 31 % ( 16 52 ) patient satisfied end result . This correlate shorten 2 cm . In prospective study 222 patient Nowak , 42 % ( 93 222 ) find persist symptom 6 month wheras 15 % find nonunion . These symptom seem persist even 9 - 10 year report 29 % 208 patient pain activity 9 % pain rest . 46 % consider fully recover . Similar result find systemic review 2144 fracture . 15.1 % ( 24 159 ) nonoperative treat dislocated fracture result nonuion , whereas 2,2 % ( 10 460 ) 2 % ( 5 152 ) nonunions find fracture treat operatively either plate intramedullary pin . On basis , become evident conservative treatment give much inferior result compare earlier report result . The operative approach midclavicular fracture traditionally plate osteosynthesis intramedullary nailing . Poigenfürst 1992 show series 122 patient low nonunion rate good functional result plat . Likewise , intramedullary nailing describe alternative technique good result . Kettler demonstrate en series 87 patient good functional result union 97,7 % ( 85 87 ) infection . Similar result fond Rehm 2004 , one nonunion 136 fracture treat constant score one year implant removal 97 . Operative treatment displace midclavicular fracture thus show reliable good result compare earlier report result . In 2007 , Canadian Orthopedic Trauma Society publish prospective randomise control trial 132 patient , randomise either conservative treatment sling , plate fixation . The operative group show clear superiority Constant DASH score , reduction risk develop non-union , early return work . With intramedullary nail use ESIN technique , Smekal et al demonstrate superior result operative group prospective randomise control trial 60 patient . 30 patient opereated elastic stable intramedullary nailing , 30 patient randomise conservative treatment sling . The operative group few complication , short time union well functional outcome . It seem , reasonable offer operative treatment active adult displace fracture middle third clavicle due risk develop symptomatic non- malunion . Both plate fixation intramedullary nailing displace fracture describe safe method operative treatment . To knowledge , never conduct prospective randomise control trial compare different form former mention operative alternative . On basis , plan contuct prospective randomise control trial compare operative plate fixation intramedullary nailing TEN .</detailed_description>
