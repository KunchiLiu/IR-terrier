	<brief_summary>Assess whether postoperative antibiotic cholecystectomy acute lithiasic cholecystitis little moderately severe , effective therefore justify . The main objective compare occurrence postoperative infectious complication include surgical site infection ( SSI ) remote infection early cholecystectomy ( perform within 5 day onset symptom ) acute lithiasic cholecystitis ( ALC ) little moderately serious ( without organ dysfunction ) without postoperative antibiotic . The secondary objective : - Rates infectious complication accord duration preoperative antibiotic - Influence surgical drainage surgery occurrence postoperative infectious complication - Analysis nature infectious complication ( surgical site infection , remote surgical site infection ) - Comparison germ find bile postoperative infectious complication - Duration hospitalization - Readmission rate surgical site infection - Rate reoperation surgical site infection - Overall mortality rate 30 day - Mortality rate specific 30 day</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Place Antibiotics Postoperative Acute Lithiasic Cholecystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicentre national , comparative , randomize , uncontrolled , non-inferiority , unblinded ( open ) . Two group patient compare ( postoperative antibiotic versus antibiotic postoperatively ) ratio ( 1:1 ) , intention treat . The international consensus conference hold Tokyo , define precisely ALC ( acute lithiasic cholecystis ) distinguish several stage severity . For study , definition degree severity use . ALC define association local sign : - Murphy 's sign - mass - pain - defense right upper quadrant - systemic sign ( fever , leukocytosis , elevate C-reactive protein ) . When diagnosis ALC clinically suspect , image procedure ( ultrasound , CT MRI ) need confirm diagnosis . The morphological evidence diagnosis ALC : - thicken gallbladder wall ( &gt; 4 mm ) - gallbladder distention ( &gt; 8cm 4cm long axis minor axis ) - presence stone debris bile ( sludge ) - infiltration fat perivesicular - presence effusion perivesicular . In work , early ALC define disease duration symptom less 5 day . This period define early onset abdominal pain / fever . These criterion collect case report form . Because event ALC may range mild disease confine gallbladder disease , fulminant life-threatening , new classification severity ALC establish . This classification 3 level : - ALC mild , - ALC moderately severe - ALC severe . - ALC mild ( Grade I ) ALC mild ( Grade I ) correspond ALC patient good general condition , without organ dysfunction , mild inflammatory sign . At stage criterion higher stage ( Grade II III ) . - ALC moderately severe ( Grade II ) ALC moderately severe comprises least one follow criterion : - Leukocytosis great 18,000 leucocytes/mm3 - Tense palpable mass clinical examination right hypochondrium - Duration symptom exceed 72 hour - Presence local sign inflammation ( biliary peritonitis , perivesicular abscess , liver abscess , gangrenous cholecystitis , emphysematous cholecystitis ) - ALC severe ( Grade III ) ( non-inclusion criterion study ABCAL ) ALC ( Grade III ) accompany dysfunction one following : - Dysfunction Cardiovascular : hypotension require treatment dopamine ≥ 5μg/kg per minute whatever dobutamine dose . - Neurological dysfunction : alteration consciousness - Respiratory dysfunction : report PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 - Renal dysfunction : oliguria , creatinine &gt; 176μmol / l - Hepatocellular dysfunction : INR &gt; 1.5 - Hematologic dysfunction : platelet count &lt; 100 000/mm3 Patients include age suffering : - acute lithiasic cholecystitis confirm morphological examination - low moderately severe ( confined gallbladder ) - require early cholecystectomy ( progression symptom &lt; 5 day ) - sign consent participation The patient inform existence protocol consultation ask indication cholecystectomy acute cholecystitis . The medical examination imaging procedure prior study correspond routine practice ( additional cost ) : A clinical examination collection demographic data ( gender , age , weight , size ) note . All co-morbidities well situation potential risk infection ( diabetes type 2 steroid ongoing chronic renal failure , body mass index 30 , age 65 year , recent surgery , serum albumin less 35 , chronic obstructive bronchitis , tobacco wean unweaned ? coronary insufficiency ) note ( CRF ) . A review image vesicular confirm diagnosis acute cholecystitis , may base habit ultrasound CT / MRI . All patient select check inclusion criterion non-inclusion offer participate study . They orally inform progress study various examination , information form issue . The day surgery , period reflection varies date result surgery , inclusion visit conduct include : - The verification inclusion criterion non-inclusion - A clinical examination - The organization 's planning examination specific study . When inclusion patient , investigator inform proponent fax inclusion submit Form Inclusion form ( see report form ) . Patient monitor - Preoperative support Preoperative prescription antibiotic systematic patient include study . The preoperative antibiotic association include : amoxicillin-clavulanate ( Augmentin ® 2gx3/jour generic dosage equivalent ) . In case allergy beta-lactam antibiotic , patient exclude study . Patients include study , either hospitalization ( use emergency shelter ) , either patient hospitalize department ( gastroenterology , geriatrics , internal medicine , etc.. ) . A proportion patient already start antibiotic ( prescribed physician , department patient hospitalize ) . The history antibiotic receive patient collected case report form analyze . For patient , inclusion study prior cholecystectomy , antibiotic arrest replaced amoxicillin - clavulanic acid dose 2gx3/jour , absence beta-lactam antibiotic allergy . The total duration preoperative antibiotic depend time surgery last , case , less 5 day ( inclusion criterion ) . The total duration antibiotic therapy amoxicillin - clavulanate analyze . - Postoperative support The intraoperative antibiotic identical antibiotic start preoperative ( amoxicillin clavulanic acid ) . A skin preparation surgery ( antiseptic shower ) surgical ( debridement antisepsis operative field ) perform . The intervention begin thorough exploration entire peritoneal cavity gallbladder confirm macroscopic diagnosis CAL . The treatment consist cholecystectomy complete choice surgical approach leave discretion operator . The laparoscopic route prefer . The realization systematic sampling biliary compare germ find gallbladder germ find postoperative complication . The achievement intraoperative cholangiography leave discretion surgical team . The need surgical drainage ( aspiration ) leave local condition custom service . The operating time record analyze . These variable collect statistical analysis ( CRF ) . In wan intervention , patient bile peritonitis stone bile duct discover intraoperative cholangiography include study . - Randomization Randomization perform operate theater immediately surgery . The randomization do draw lots patient 's statement via Internet . It stratify center ensure good balance , block equal size many patient randomize either treatment , use center . - Postoperative management - Monitoring Visits - Choice postoperative antibiotic Prescription postoperative antibiotic , determine randomization . Before administration antibiotic , patient include questioned existence possible allergy beta-lactam antibiotic ( CRF ) . The postoperative antibiotic therapy identical preoperative antibiotic therapy include follow antibiotic : amoxicillin - clavulanate ( Augmentin ® 2gx3/jour ) . Antibiotic treatment issue pharmacy center investigator . The combination nitro-imidazole allow study . The route administration ( intravenous oral ) date relay orally depend clinical biological postoperative patient collect case report form . The introduction antibiotic perform hospital surveillance tolerance drug . The duration postoperative antibiotic treatment 5 day . - Support postoperative hospitalization Patients clinically monitor daily surgical team . All patient blood test blood count day operation ( CRF ) . Other blood test may perform accord clinical biological patient evolution . Patients may leave service surgeon deem necessary , 2nd postoperative day . The antibiotic treatment Augmentin ® issue pharmacy center investigator . Antibiotics store dispensed pharmacy center . Antibiotics issue patient ( 1 gram packet ) output entire duration 5 day .</detailed_description>
