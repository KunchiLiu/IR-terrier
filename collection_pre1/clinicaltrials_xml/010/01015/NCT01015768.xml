	<brief_title>Corneal Staining Physiological Compromise After Eight Hours Soft Contact Lens Wear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation evaluate corneal stain epithelial barrier function eight hour contact lens wear , past peak staining time typical daily lens wear time . A silicone hydrogel lens multipurpose solution combination show induce significant corneal staining ( e.g . equivalent Grade 3 Grade 4 scale ) use evaluate potential corneal compromise . The study prospective , single-center , double-masked , contralateral , daily wear investigation adapt soft contact lens wearer . After three day washout period ( without lens wear , lenses worn one day eight hour . Corneal stain barrier function determine regimen saline control situation subject . Staining grade use Efron Grading Scale , permeability data estimate fluorescein penetration rate , Pdc nm/sec test control condition .</detailed_description>
