	<brief_summary>Aim : This longitudinal cohort study ass long-term clinical outcome patient admit institution first episode uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis . Methods : All patient diagnose first episode sigmoid diverticulitis evaluate inclusion study , pending informed consent . Those patient evidence complicate diverticulitis ( fistula , abscess ) receive recommendation undergo elective sigmoid resection , simple attack recruit cohort . Follow-up perform yearly interval telephone interview patient . The duration study expect last 10 year ( 2010-2020 ) , &gt; 50 new patients/year , total &gt; 500 patient . Endpoints : 1. occurrence second episode diverticulitis 2. severity outcome recurrent diverticulitis 3. evolution digestive symptom quality life ( QoL ) 4. need subsequent elective emergency sigmoid resection Rationale : This study help determine risk/benefit current approach common condition , manage patient conservatively antibiotic adopt wait-and-see attitude . Specifically , follow event assess quantitatively : - rate relapse urban community . - burden common disease QoL digestive function - percentage patient may need emergency surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Sigmoid Diverticulitis : The Geneva Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonic diverticulosis increasingly common condition Western society ; country , third population affect 6th decade two-thirds 9th decade . Fortunately , majority patient diverticulosis remain asymptomatic ; diverticulitis , common presentation diverticular disease , estimate incidence 10 patient per 100,000/year . The diagnosis sigmoid diverticulitis usually suspect clinically patient present acute lower abdominal pain , associate inflammatory syndrome elevate CRP and/or leukocytes count . The preferred imaging modality establish definitive diagnosis computerize tomography ( CT ) scan triple ( oral , intravenous intra-rectal ) administration contrast . CT scan may also influence management demonstrate whether sigmoid diverticulitis simple ( phlegmonous , show infiltration pericolic fat thicken intestinal wall ) complicate ( abscess , fistula peritonitis ) . A majority patient present simple diverticulitis , conservatively successfully manage antibiotic alone . Full colonoscopy perform eventually , order rule associate condition , notably cancer Crohn 's disease . Colonic diverticular disease usually restrict sigmoid colon , conservative treatment antibiotic indicate case first attack uncomplicated diverticulitis , rationale majority patient treat first episode acute inflammation eventually recover problem . Elective sigmoidectomy currently recommend follow clinical situation : - Patients two episode uncomplicated diverticulitis . - Patients one episode complicate ( perforate ) diverticulitis , either pericolic pelvic abscess ( Hinchey stage I II respectively ) , fistula formation and/or stenosis . These guideline , however , reflect expert consensus rather scientific evidence ; currently , way predict patient risk develop subsequent complication recurrence . Thus , important question determine whether conservative approach simply delay definitive treatment expose patient additional complication alteration quality life . 3 . OBJECTIVES The main objective study assess natural history sigmoid diverticulitis cohort patient live urban community , radiological endoscopic evidence diverticular disease , benefit initially adequate antibiotherapy , receive dietary counselling , follow long period time . In order , ass prospectively follow variable : 3.1 . Primary endpoint - Annual rate recurrent diverticulitis - Severity time recurrent episode - Quality Life gastrointestinal symptom assess GIQLI questionnaire 3.2 . Secondary endpoint - Risk undergoing emergency surgery - Surgical morbidity/mortality</detailed_description>
