	<brief_title>Dasatinib , Bevacizumab , Paclitaxel Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Dasatinib design decrease activity one proteins responsible uncontrolled growth tumor cell . This may cause tumor cell die . Bevacizumab design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . Methylnaltrexone design block constipate effect opioid analgesic gastrointestinal tract . It also capable block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Study Groups : Dose escalation : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level dasatinib , bevacizumab , paclitaxel base join study . Up 8 dose level dasatinib , bevacizumab , paclitaxel test . Three ( 3 ) 9 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination dasatinib , bevacizumab , paclitaxel find . The high tolerable dose combination dasatinib , bevacizumab , paclitaxel find give combination methylnaltrexone 6 participant . If intolerable side effect occur , next group 6 participant receive low dose methylnaltrexone dose combination dasatinib , bevacizumab , paclitaxel . Dose expansion : Once high safe dose combination dasatinib , bevacizumab , paclitaxel without methylnaltrexone find , 14 additional participant enrol receive study drug dose level combination . Participants tumor type ( 14 tumor type ) respond study drug combination receive study drug dose level , well . Study Drug Administration : Each study `` cycle '' 28 day . Everyday , take dasatinib mouth 1 time day . You take time day food cup water ( 8 ounce ) . On Days 1 15 cycle , receive bevacizumab vein 90 minute . If first dose well tolerate , receive next dose 60 minute . If second dose well tolerate , receive next dos 30 minute . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , receive paclitaxel vein 60 minute . On Days 1 15 , paclitaxel dose give bevacizumab dose . About 30 minute schedule dose paclitaxel , also receive medication ( dexamethasone ) low likelihood experience allergic reaction . If receive methylnaltrexone , receive injection skin either upper arm , upper thigh , stomach time 2 time every day . The study doctor nurse teach give injection . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask current health condition , drug may take , experienced side effect . Around Days 8 28 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Around Day 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Around Day 28 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 4 week , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn urine collect pregnancy test able become pregnant . Every 8 week , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . If study doctor think need , perform often . Length Study : You may stay study long disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest . End-of-Study Visit : About 28 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure may perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . This investigational study . Dasatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic myeloid leukemia . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal , breast , lung , brain cancer . Paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment breast , lung , ovarian cancer Kaposi 's sarcoma . Methylnaltrexone FDA approve commercially available treatment constipation patient advance illness receive palliative care . The combination drug give patient advanced cancer investigational . Up 218 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
