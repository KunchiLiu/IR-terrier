	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer death United States associate poor prognosis . The average life expectancy diagnosis approximately 5 8 month . At present , successful surgical resection curative therapy improve long-term survival . However , achieve tumor detect early stage . Unfortunately , due non-specific symptom associate pancreatic cancer , commonly detect later stage disease . The investigator hypothesize pancreatic cancer could detect measure change early increase blood supply ( EIBS ) find surround normal-appearing duodenal tissue . The investigator test device call Four-dimensional Elastic Light-Scattering Fingerprinting ( 4D-ELF ) . The device use study consider investigational , mean either approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) routine clinical use use describe study . However FDA allow use device research study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Increase Blood Flow ( EIBS ) Duodenum Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According field effect theory , detect microvasculature change early increase blood supply surround tissue neoplastic lesion identify distance . The objective study determine feasibility efficacy fiberoptic probe contain novel Polarization Gating Spectroscopy ( PGS ) technology identify patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PAC ) field effect theory . EIBS marker , deoxyhemoglobin concentration ( DHb ) , average blood vessel radius ( BVR ) evaluate patient PAC versus control . During subject ' esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) upper endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) , new optic probe insert inside endoscope advance tip endoscope prior scope withdrawn . As scope withdrawn , light optic probe use examine approximately 5 section small bowel : 1 ) directly ampulla , 2 ) approximately 5 mm proximal ampulla , 3 ) approximately 5 mm distal ampulla , 4 ) 1 cm proximal ampulla , 5 ) 1 cm distal ampulla . Spectroscopy measurement obtain four time five peri-ampullary location . The rest EGD upper EUS endoscopy procedure complete clinically indicated . During procedure , visualize mucosal abnormality record photographed .</detailed_description>
