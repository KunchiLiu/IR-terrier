	<brief_title>Efficacy Study T2 Versus AZA Maintain Clinical Endoscopic Remission Postoperative Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease characterize inflammation ulceration small intestine colon . Patients commonly experience abdominal pain , diarrhea，malnutrition malaise result decrease quality life increase risk chronic disability unemployment . Surgical resection require approximately 70 % patient time . However , recurrence disease operation occur majority patient serious limitation surgical management . Patients ' quality life often severely diminish . Currently available therapeutic option maintenance remission Crohn 's disease inadequate . A clear need exist well-tolerated drug reliably reduce risk disease relapse . AZA classical immunomodulator , often apply hematologic disease immune-related disease , also commonly use drug maintenance remission Crohn 's disease , indicate steroid resistant dependent patient , whose frequency relapse &gt; 1 per year , patient induction remission IFX , patient whose remission induce surgical resection . However , AZA may cause adverse effect , serious adverse effect leucopenia , develop suddenly unpredictably , though rare ( around 3 % ) . T2 chloroform/methanol extract Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F ( TWHF ) , traditional Chinese medicine , use rheumatoid arthritis nephritis . It immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory activities.Our previous animal study reveal major component T2 , triptolide , could prevent development chronic colitis interleukin-10 deficient mouse . The phase I clinical trial institute also demonstrate T2 , combine enteral nutrition , efficient induction remission patient active Crohn 's disease.The common adverse effect T2 leucopenia , liver renal toxicity , oligospermia amenorrhea .</detailed_description>
