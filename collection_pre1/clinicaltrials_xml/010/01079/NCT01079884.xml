	<detailed_description>The implication sleep relate physiology pathogenesis number diseases recently ignore . With evolution sleep laboratory , emerge recognition relationship sleep various gastrointestinal disease particular gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . Twenty five ( 25 ) patient meet entry criterion compare 25 matching historical control patient GERD symptom sleep disturbance . Patients record heartburn symptom GERD-associated sleep disturbance diary card . These patient evaluate baseline functionality GERD symptom score , PSQI , drive simulator , bed partner questionnaire ( optional ) receive 40 mg daily Nexium® 4 week . Primary outcome variable drive simulator performance relief nighttime heartburn last 7 day trial record patient diary card . Secondary outcome variable include change baseline week 4 PSQI score , percentage patient complete resolution sleep disturbance , relief sleep disturbance , percentage day without GERD-associated sleep disturbance . Assessment patient complete resolution daytime , night time , 24-hour heartburn symptom , percentage patient relief daytime 24-hour heartburn symptom . The driving simulator performance compare baseline 4 week therapy Nexium® . Also , available , bed partner PSQI compare baseline follow treatment primary patient Nexium® 4 week .</detailed_description>
