	<brief_title>Initiation Colon Cancer Screening Veterans `` Start Screening Now ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) 2nd lead cause cancer death US risk increase age . Colorectal cancer screening ( CRCS ) offer possibility early detection prevention . For average risk , CRCS begin age 50 recommend . However , awareness use CRCS test low . We propose conduct randomize control trial develop test step intervention increase initial uptake CRCS nationally-representative , ethnically-diverse sample male female veteran . Our specific aim : ( 1 ) develop pre-test step intervention component theory evidence-informed ; ( 2 ) implement evaluate process , efficacy , cost-effectiveness step intervention increase initial CRCS among male female veteran age 50-64 year ; ( 3 ) analyze association predictor variable CRCS initiation mediate moderate effect intervention , step . In Step 1 , evaluate theory-based minimal cue deliver letter , telephone call , automate telephone call compare survey-only control group determine whether 3 different delivery channel equally efficacious cost-effective . Minimal cue cost-effective method prompt action willing change easy disseminate real-world setting . Persons complete CRCS Step 1 randomize Step 2 intensive intervention address resistance . In Step 2 determine whether theory-based , tailor telephone intervention , use principle Motivation Interviewing , effective deliver part sequential intervention process early adopter remove population . Step 2 also determine whether automated approach , telephone-linked communication ( TLC ) , effective telephone counselor promote initiation CRCS . Steps 1 2 together address important issue `` dose '' need encourage completion CRCS . After step , examine mediate moderate effect intervention identify determinant completion . For cancer screen intervention research broad public health impact , intervention must potential dissemination . We design trial move u toward goal disseminable intervention evidence external validity .</detailed_description>
