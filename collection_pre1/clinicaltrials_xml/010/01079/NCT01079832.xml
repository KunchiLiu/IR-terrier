	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery Using CyberKnife Treating Women With Advanced Recurrent Gynecological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary goal study estimate rate grade 3 high acute toxicity observe 6 month period follow CyberKnife radiosurgery gynecologic cancer . II . To evaluate clinical response radio-surgery gynecologic tumor . III . To assess general site specific quality life ( use SF-12 , FACT-En , FACT-O , FACT-Cx FACT-V ) evaluate patient 's level pain . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . As secondary objective , toxicities 2 year follow CyberKnife radiosurgery also describe . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 3 fraction CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month .</detailed_description>
