	<brief_title>Effects Knee-extensor Exercise Training Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced exercise tolerance one hallmark COPD . The principal cause exercise intolerance ventilatory limitation lead deconditioning inactivity . However weak correlation exercise capacity FEV1 imply factor reduce pulmonary function contribute impairment well . Several study find change skeletal muscle , fibre shift , increase oxidative stress , increase inflammatory cytokine impair mitochondrial function , suggest low limb dysfunction . Numerous exercise study COPD patient show physiological physiological benefit train endurance training regard important part pulmonary rehabilitation . In study investigate training effect patient moderate severe COPD special focus skeletal muscle . COPD patient perform high intensity aerobic interval knee-extensor exercise training 3 days/week six week . At baseline follow-up , muscle oxygen consumption mitochondrial respiration measure .</detailed_description>
