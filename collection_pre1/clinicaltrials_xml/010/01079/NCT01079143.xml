	<brief_summary>Recently , early biomarkers renal interstitial fibrosis identify , amongst de novo expression vimentin tubular epithelial cell , intermediate filament , translocation beta-catenin cytoplasm . These marker , present , suggest epithelial cell undergoes phenomenon well know `` epithelial mesenchymal transition '' ( EMT ) could behave like myo-fibroblast . EMT highly instrumental several model tissue fibrosis , include kidney . Actually , demonstrate marker detectable renal graft early time point post-transplant ( i.e . soon three month ) , also intensity expression correlate progression interstitial fibrosis graft 3 12 month</brief_summary>
