	<detailed_description>This Phase IV open-label clinical profiling study . The population enrol consist healthy adult age 18-60 year . A total approximately 60 subject plan enrolment study . Subjects enrol study receive 7.5 µg vaccine + MF59 ( 9.75 mg/dose ) . Each subject receive one 0.5 mL IM dose ( deltoid muscle , non-dominant arm ) H1N1sw vaccine Visit 1 , blood draw . Up 70 mL blood drawn CMI antibody assessment subject study visit . Subjects request declare occurrence influenza-related symptom study period . Whenever appropriate , subject might ask provide throat swab viral typing . Subjects laboratory confirm H1N1sw influenza might ask provide one blood sample ( 70 mL ) within 4 week influenza resolution . Although study design powered draw conclusion regard safety tolerability , subject follow , analyze , safety throughout study . After vaccination , subject remain medical supervision study site 30 minute monitor evaluate possible immediate hypersensitivity reaction . All study subject instruct completion diary card record local systemic reaction seven day , start day vaccination continue 6 following day .
