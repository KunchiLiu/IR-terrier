	<brief_summary>Ovarian reserve relate chronological age ; 35 year age accept threshold significant decline assist reproductive technology ( ART ) success scarce follicular recruitment poor oocyte retrieval . New therapeutic scheme seek improve follicular response ovarian age increase number infertile woman age old 35 year try get pregnant . The advent gonadotropin release hormone analogue antagonist ( GnRHant ) offer new perspective address issue relate advanced reproductive age since prevents premature luteinizing hormone ( LH ) surge cause suppression early follicular phase . Gonadotropin release hormone analogue antagonist administer latter stage ovarian stimulation prevent LH surge competitive blockade gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) receptor , thus produce marked decrease LH level interplay follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) LH become important complete follicular development oocyte competence . Some study past show potential recombinant human LH ( r-hLH ) supplementation woman advance reproductive age improve oocyte quality , study small size provide data physiological mechanism behind benefit obtain . This randomized , comparative , parallel control Phase II study conduct infertile female subject age 35-42 year undergo in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) /intra cytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) , investigate whether addition r-hLH ( lead follicle great [ &gt; ] 14 millimeter [ mm ] size ) , standard protocol recombinant human FSH ( r-hFSH ) GnRHant , improve number quality oocytes retrieve , implantation rate , pregnancy rate , assess hormonal milieu ovarian follicular fluid . Comparison perform ovarian stimulation without addition r-hLH , ( i.e . ) r-hFSH GnRHant alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Assess Efficacy Safety LuverisÂ® ( Lutropin Alfa ) Mid Follicular Phase Controlled Ovarian Stimulation ( COS ) Advanced Reproductive Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical pharmacology study demonstrate r-hLH LH/human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) receptor affinity similar pituitary human luteinizing hormone ( p-hLH ) , biologically active in-vitro stimulate steroidogenesis promote oocyte germinal vesicle breakdown . Several clinical study investigate usefulness r-hLH supplementation normal ovulatory woman undergo ART almost sub-populations subject identify benefit , r-hLH add FSH . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To determine efficacy add r-hLH mid-follicular phase compare add r-hLH , woman 35-42 year age include COS r-hFSH treatment GnRHant IVF/ICSI , assess number quality oocyte - To determine safety use r-hLH combine r-hFSH protocol GnRHant , include incidence ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) adverse event ( AEs ) well local tolerability Secondary objective : - To complete verification efficacy additional assessment follicular growth , oocyte fertilization , embryo quality pregnancy rate - To investigate underlying mechanism possible improvement oocyte quality mean determine hormone level ( LH , FSH , T , E2 , hCG ) level follicular fluid Tertiary objective : - This phase-II study aim carry assessment pharmacoeconomics quality life All subject undergo treatment r-hFSH daily dose 300-450 IU subcutaneous route start stimulation Day 1 ( S1 ) r-hCG administration . Upon detection lead follicle &gt; 14 mm diameter , GnRHant 0.25 milligram ( mg ) /day subcutaneous administration initiate continued r-hCG administration day . Subjects randomly allocate ( time S1 GnRHant initiation day ) either additional treatment r-hLH daily fix dose 150 IU continue treatment r-hFSH alone . Gonadotropin release hormone antagonist combine treatment r-hLH plus ( + ) r-hFSH r-hFSH alone administer least one follicle &gt; 18 mm diameter two additional follicle &gt; 16 mm diameter present E2 level commensurate number size follicle present . A single injection 250-500 microgram r-hCG , give induce final follicular maturation within 36 hour last r-hLH and/or r-hFSH injection day last GnRHant morning administration . Oocytes retrieve 34-38 hour r-hCG administration , assess , fertilize in-vitro ICSI . Not 3 embryo replace day 2 3 OPU . The luteal phase support daily vaginal administration natural progesterone , start OPU continue either menstruation pregnancy test , subject pregnant , least 30 day laboratory evidence pregnancy . Each subject followed-up treatment outcome ( pregnancy menstruation ) record . For subject receive r-hCG menstruate , blood sample collect local determination serum beta-hCG level post-hCG day 15-20 . If positive ( beta-hCG &gt; 10 International Unit/liter [ IU/L ] ) , confirm perform second test within one week later . An ultrasound scan ( US ) perform post-hCG day 35-42 subject become pregnant provided miscarriage occur . The number fetal sacs fetal heart activity record . Active follow-up pregnancy perform , include subject withdrawn study .</detailed_description>
