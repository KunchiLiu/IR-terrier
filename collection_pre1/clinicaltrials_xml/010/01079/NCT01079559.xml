	<brief_summary>Rationale : Infection follow total knee replacement ( TKA ) devastate complication usually require prosthesis removal , hospitalization infection eradicate , second surgery implant revision prosthesis . For primary TKA , prophylactic antibiotic-loaded cement ( ABC ) may reduce rate infection may also reduce rate revision due implant loosening . Current controversy use ABC exist around world . Without definitive trial , patient expose treatment uncertain efficacy may cause antibiotic resistant bacterial strain certainly generate high cost healthcare system . Purpose : To determine , 1 ) extent ABC compare regular cement reduces infection rate patient first two year follow TKA , 2 ) resource use implication associate use ABC TKA . Methods : This randomized clinical trial 8,800 patient undergoing primary TKA allocate either Simplex™ P Tobramycin Simplex™ P bone cement . We exclude patient prior joint infection , allergy tobramycin , fix address . All patient administer IV antibiotic immediately prior surgery . Patients surgeon blind group allocation . The primary outcome measure infection . Follow-up visit take place 6 week 3 , 12 24 month postoperative . A blinded adjudicator review report infection determine whether putative infection study event . Blinded radiologists interpret 2 year series radiograph patient . We compare rate infection implant loosening two treatment group use survival analysis . This study include full economic analysis .</brief_summary>
