	<brief_summary>Background : Estimates central venous pressure ( CVP ) helpful guide fluid therapy intensive care unit , operate room emergency room . Current standard technique CVP assessment invasive , require insertion catheter subclavian , internal jugular peripheral vein . Several ultrasound base clinical method describe potential non-invasive alternative assess CVP . Aim : To prospectively evaluate accuracy CVP assessment ) inferior vena cava diameter collapsibility b ) internal jugular vein diameter c ) compression sonography forearm vein ) clinical assessment peripheral vein collapse comparison invasive CVP measurement . Study design : single center , prospective observational study Patients Methods : We examine 77 consecutive patient invasive venous access invasive hemodynamic monitoring surgical intensive care unit ( ICU ) . After obtain informed consent , ultrasound examination inferior vena cava , internal jugular vein compression sonography forearm vein well clinical evaluation peripheral vein collapsibility perform random sequence different experienced examiner . Invasive CVP record simultaneously measurement . Examiners blind clinical parameter result previous CVP measurement . Primary endpoint : Accuracy non-invasive method determine CVP define invasively measure CVP . Secondary endpoint : Comparison feasibility non-invasive method . Expected result : We hypothesize sonographic measurement inferior vena cava diameter , internal jugular vein diameter compression sonography forearm vein well clinical assessment peripheral vein collapsibility reliable method CVP determination comparison invasive CVP measurement . Significance : The validation comparison sonographic / clinic CVP assessment would enable clinician choose accurate non-invasive method ass volume status important adjunct management many critically ill patient . The non-invasiveness method broaden feasibility measure CVP may guide fluid therapy new patient population .</brief_summary>
