	<brief_summary>Antihypertensive drug aim reduce blood pressure ( BP ) either decrease total peripheral resistance vasodilatation level arteriole ( microcirculation ) decrease cardiac output reduction stroke volume heart rate . On hand , antihypertensive drug might potentially decrease arterial stiffness passively reduction distend pressure resynchronization reflect pressure wave . With thesis potential mechanism , also expect drug might exert favorable effect pulse pressure amplification central peripheral artery . However , solid evidence widely apply antihypertensive drug differential effect brachial central BP . Several report past confirm potential hypothesis beta blocker decrease central BP le observed reduction level brachial artery . It hypothesize deceleration heart rate synchronize reflect pressure wave earlier systolic phase seem leading cause non-favorable effect beta blocker central BP , effect might partially counterbalance beta blocker high beta-1 selectivity result less peripheral vasoconstriction property .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central pulse pressure well predictor leave ventricular mass carotid intima thickness , conventional peripheral BP seem accurate reflection central arterial BP . The pulse pressure amplification peripheral central artery reflect leave ventricular afterload , subendothelial viability , intensity cyclic stress impose renal cerebral micro- macro vessel . As central hemodynamic parameter independently associate organ damage closely related important cardiovascular outcome , suggest new clinical trial antihypertensive drug treatment compare simultaneously chronic effect drug peripheral central BP . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To assess effect bisoprolol versus atenolol aortic pulse pressure central hemodynamic index subject hypertension Secondary objective : - To assess effect bisoprolol versus atenolol aortic BP central hemodynamic index subject hypertension - To assess effect bisoprolol versus atenolol AIx cfPWV arterial stiffness index subject hypertension - To assess effect bisoprolol versus atenolol aortic pulse pressure central hemodynamic index interim visit ( Visit 4 ) - To assess effect bisoprolol versus atenolol lipid profile serum glucose metabolism index - To assess effect bisoprolol versus atenolol brachial BP peripheral BP index subject hypertension - To assess safety tolerability bisoprolol versus atenolol subject hypertension The present study approximately 14 week duration comprise 1 week screening , follow 12 week treatment period 2 week post study follow contact conduct via telephone monitor additional serious adverse experience . There 4 schedule visit ( Day -7 , Day 0 , Week 4 Week 12 ) . After screen period eligibility criterion confirm , subject hypertension randomize 1:1 ratio receive treatment either bisoprolol atenolol . Hemodynamic measurement make baseline , Week 4 , Week 12 biochemical measurement make baseline ( Day 0 ) Week 12 .</detailed_description>
