	<brief_summary>In present study investigator want explore safety , pharmacokinetics , activity combination temsirolimus nelfinavir , agent PI3K /Akt/mTOR inhibit activity , patient advance malignancies.Temsirolimus proven anti tumoral activity mTOR inhibition . Nelfinavir potential inhibitor Akt . Combining agent might prevent upregulation P13k pathway increase anti-cancer activity temsirolimus . The strong CYP3A4 inhibition nelfinavir dependence temsirolimus CYP3 A4 metabolism make dose find study essential . The investigator also look prospective value biomarkers activity outcome treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Nelfinavir Temsirolimus Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past decade , characterization human tumours molecular level considerably improve . This lead development target therapeutic inhibit specific molecule pathway involve oncogenesis . One key pathway dysregulated cancer phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt/mTOR pathway . This pathway important cell growth survival . In cancer type pathway over-activated lead proliferation survival malignant cell . Inhibition pathway therefore great therapeutic potential . Both temsirolimus nelfinavir agent PI3K /Akt/mTOR inhibit activity . The main active metabolite temsirolimus sirolimus decrease mTOR activity . Inhibition mTOR activity result G1 phase cell cycle arrest subsequent inhibition tumour growth . Another effect growth factor downregulation inhibition angiogenesis . In addition , mTOR inhibition may exert anti-tumour effect induce apoptosis . Although inhibitor mTOR demonstrate clinical activity tumor type like , mantle cell lymphoma , endometrial carcinoma , neuro-endocrine tumor , malignancy resistant feedback PI3 kinase activation . Resent data suggest tumor escape mechanism overcome dual inhibition mTOR PI3 kinase . Nelfinavir well know human immuno-deficiency protease inhibitor PI3kinase inhibiting activity , via inhibition Akt , downstream PI3kinase cascade . Nelfinavir able inhibit Akt concentration achieve HIV patient standard antiviral dos . Nelfinavir therefore feasable generally well tolerated agent use combination temsirolimus overcome resistance mTOR inhibition . Simultaneous inhibition mTOR/PI3kinase pathway temsirolimus nelfinavir promise strategy treat cancer .</detailed_description>
