	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , ixabepilone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Ixabepilone may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving radiation therapy chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose ixabepilone give together radiation therapy see well work treat patient high-risk stage III prostate cancer surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum-tolerated dose dose-limiting toxicity ixabepilone combination concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy patient high-risk prostate cancer prostatectomy . ( Phase I ) - To determine toxicity profile regimen patient . ( Phase I ) Secondary - To assess freedom progression patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - To assess biochemical failure , local failure , distant failure patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - To assess disease-specific survival overall survival patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - To evaluate acute late toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ixabepilone follow phase II study . Patients undergo adjuvant intensity-modulated radiation therapy daily , 5 day week , 7-9 week . Patients also receive concurrent ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Treatment ixabepilone repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 6 year .</detailed_description>
