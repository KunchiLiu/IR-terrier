	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , open label study include asthmatic 17-55 year age evidence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Patients eligible visit one four Emergency Departments ( EDs ) Edmonton Calgary receive treatment acute asthma result discharge home . All patient primary care provider ( PCP : Family Physician , Internist Nurse Practitioner ) follow-up one found .

A sample 366 patient ( 122 per group ) require base proportion relapse 90 day ( 40 % ) chi-square test association post-hoc test ( group A vs. B , group B vs. C ) . This sample allow detection moderate effect size least 0.171 , difference group A B 50 % ( i.e. , 40 % vs. 20 % ) group B C 75 % ( i.e. , 20 % vs. 5 % ) use two-sided z-tests , 80 % power , α=0.025 . Intention treat analysis conduct . Relapse rate group associate 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) calculate . Proportions among group compare use chi-square test statistically significant , separate proportion test compare pairs group adjust multiple testing . A multivariable logistic regression model adjust effect estimate potential baseline imbalance site-specific difference effectiveness .</detailed_description>
