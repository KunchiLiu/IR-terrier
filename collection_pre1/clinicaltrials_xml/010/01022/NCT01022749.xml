	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Flu Vaccine Immunodepression Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Annual vaccination influenza recommend high risk complication , particularly among patient immunodeficiency include result immunosuppressive treatment administer chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . However , publish data show influenza vaccination coverage low population ( &lt; 30 % ) due lack data effectiveness vaccination patient theoretical risk negative impact evolution IBD . To improve influenza vaccination coverage population treat immunosuppressant chronic IBD , essential data effectiveness vaccination population . The research aim evaluate immunogenicity influenza vaccination patient follow chronic IBD . Factors choice study population follow : 1 . IBD common disease . Among inflammatory disease treat immunosuppressant reach patient 65 year , IBD among frequent . They result abnormal immune response gut flora management often require prescription immunosuppressive drug ( azathioprine , methotrexate , particular ) recently TNF-blockers ; 2. existence vaccine recommendation publish recently specific patient immunosuppressive therapy great risk complication related influenza ; 3. fact vaccination implicate pathogenesis disease ; 4. data show vaccination recommendation poorly follow population . A recently publish work find vaccination coverage influenza 28 % cohort 169 patient treated IBD ; The methodology choose phase III , prospective , open , vaccine trial . The primary endpoint humoral immunogenicity induce vaccine . The study schedule 2 successive year ass value annual vaccination repeat population treat immunosuppressant . There benefit patient participate study vaccinate influenza benefit clinical laboratory monitoring study . Moreover , patient take vaccinated event pandemic influenza</detailed_description>
