	<brief_summary>This proposal represent unified programme support clinical academic staff Departments Paediatrics Imperial College St Mary 's Hospital . St Mary 's Hospital hub paediatric network West London , form part Paediatric Intensive Care Network London region , potential access population 3 million child . We aim improve diagnosis understand child infectious , inflammatory allergic condition . Our study establish well-characterised cohort patient define condition , microbiological patient sample use understand contribution genetic background , differential gene expression , proteomics pathogen type disease process . Unwell child come St Mary 's hospital route invite join study . Entering study entail child blood take research purpose addition clinically indicated test . We also recruit well ( control ) child blood test perform elective purpose , surgery . In addition , child present illness likely infectious aetiology also sample collected microbiological diagnosis . Those sample take ordinary diagnostic purpose ( blood , urine , CSF , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid nasal brushing epithelial cell culture ) would also use state-of-the-art diagnostic technique , order maximise likelihood confirm microbiological diagnosis . Where healthy , uninfected child invasive procedure , lumbar puncture , would aim recruit child control collect biological sample CSF sample . This bid address need translational research paediatrics , build world-class basic science clinical paediatric base Imperial College St Mary 's Hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There currently little understanding mechanism respiratory infection cause severe illness death . The emergence H1N1/09 major cause childhood severe illness 2009 permit study virus trigger severe disease , inflammatory response H1N1 differs infection . It likely host-mediated inflammatory process trigger infect agent contributes severe illness . In addition , viral infection induces profound change innate immune response common bacterial pathogen , increase bacterial colonisation normally sterile low airway . Thus host bacterial factor may contribute lung damage severe respiratory infection . This study initiate identify aetiology immunopathologic mechanism childhood respiratory infection ( Immunopathology Respiratory Infection Study - IRIS ) , recruit child suspect respiratory infection respiratory failure ( control ) . This dataset provide unique resource study disease mechanisms child range infection include H1N1/09 infection , RSV , Rhinovirus , common respiratory virus severe bacterial infection .</detailed_description>
