	<brief_summary>Herceptin show significant improvement breast cancer therapy improve survival patient over-expressing HER-2 protein 50 % . However , Herceptin show negatively affect heart , frequent heart monitoring multiple gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan require . MUGA scan use radiation accurate . This study use cardiac magnetic resonance image ( CMRs ) evaluate heart function compare MUGA scan patient receive Herceptin early-stage breast cancer . In addition , novel biomarkers also assess time help identify possible patient risk develop heart toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Cardiotoxicity Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , serial MUGA scan image modality choice monitoring cardiotoxicity . However , MUGA scan measure LVEF cost ionizing radiation considerable inter-study variability , reliably detect cardiomyopathy . CMR highly accurate technique represent promise image alternative . Because CMR consider gold standard measure LVEF subclinical alteration cardiac structure function , use prospective observational pilot study determine effectiveness monitor cardiotoxicity patient receive trastuzumab . Serial CMR compare serial MUGA scan , routinely use LVEF monitor trastuzumab therapy , standard practice . Cardiac biomarkers also measure relation CMR MUGA scan . Furthermore , determine long-term clinical prognostic implication trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity detect various method . This double-blinded prospective observational pilot study breast cancer patient overexpression HER2 breast pathology ( use either immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] and/or fluorescence in-situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) , never receive trastuzumab , treat trastuzumab .</detailed_description>
