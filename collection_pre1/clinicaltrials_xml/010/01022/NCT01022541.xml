	<brief_title>Capecitabine Oxaliplatin Plus Bevacizumab Neoadjuvant Treatment Untreated Unresectable Liver-only Metastases From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No previous treatment . The 21 day cycle treatment give four course reassess MRI/CT resectability liver metastasis . Those patient stable disease partial response , yet resectable continue four course treatment reassessment . Patients whose liver metastases become resectable proceed surgery 6 week break last administration Capecitabine ( 8 week last administration Bevacizumab ) . A four course treatment administer post-operatively commence least 8 week surgery patient well recover heal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis colorectal adenocarcinoma Metastatic disease present liver . Absence extrahepatic metastasis exclude CT chest , abdomen pelvis . Indeterminate CT finding may require verification FDGPET scanning . Liveronly metastasis determine unresectable presentation pretreatment liver MRI appropriate liver specific contrast ( eg . TESLA ) specialist multidisciplinary team ( consist medical oncologist , hepatic surgeon radiologist ) . Guidelines determine unresectability include : presence &gt; 4 metastasis ; size &gt; 5cm ; location distribution metastatic disease within liver unsuitable resection clear margin ( eg . Involvement lob liver ; invasion intrahepatic vascular structure ) ; extent liver involvement preclude resection adequate postresection residual liver parenchyma volume viable liver function immediate postoperative period ; inability retain adequate vascular flow flow maintain viable liver function . No previous treatment metastatic colorectal cancer , include chemotherapy , target experimental therapy ( e.g . antiVEGF antiEGFR ) , radiotherapy liver , surgery radiofrequency ablation liver metastasis . Feasibility surgery curative intent : If primary colorectal tumour situ , primary tumour must also resectable curative intent Patients present liver metastasis relapse initially curative resection primary colorectal cancer follow treatment adjuvant chemotherapy may enter study relapse occur within 12 month completion adjuvant treatment Adequate medical fitness undergo neoadjuvant treatment surgery curative intent ( hepatectomy +/ resection primary tumour , require ) Absence preexist liver dysfunction Childs Pugh Grade B great . Patients suspect preexist liver dysfunction due clinical , biochemical radiological finding , significant liver disease exclude liver biopsy prior study entry .</criteria>
