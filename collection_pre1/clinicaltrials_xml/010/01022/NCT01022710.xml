	<brief_summary>This study measure sound produce sensory receptor inner ear call hair cell . These sound call otoacoustic emission one special case investigator study call distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAEs ) produce present two tone ear . If ear damage noise exposure DPOAEs reduce . In study investigator attempt improve DPOAE test add third tone make test frequency specific . Whether third tone help determine compare DPOAEs collect without third tone clinical audiogram . If addition third tone help investigator expect DPOAEs track function frequency ( DP-grams ) closely match clinical audiogram .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal propose research identify feature distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAEs ) eventually improve clinical method early detection noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) , major sensory disability suffer military Veterans , particular . Toward end , special-purpose DPOAE measure investigator call augment obtain . These DP-grams test notion subtle post-noise change DPOAE response space sensitively identify f2 basal source DPOAEs isolate use interference tone ( IT ) vector subtraction method commonly employ standard DP-gram procedure . The term 'augmented ' map DP-grams coin describe frequency function obtain IT present , condition , basal source 'fills ' 'masks ' damage pattern remove . The discovery contaminate basal source promise modify hearing field 's current knowledge concern fundamental process underlie DPOAE generation , may also lead development DPOAE test sensitively identify early stage NIHL . Such test may also useful Veterans , clinic patient often significant preexist hearing loss higher-level primary tone use increase signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) maintain sensitivity frequency specificity . The investigator test ability augment DP-grams elicit higher-level primary tone uncover damage region Veterans NIHL . The notion examine high-level primary tone useful condition preexist hearing loss conventional low-level primary use optimize augmented DP-gram removing basal source come play obscure damage cochlear region primary-tone level increase . Together , combine experiment provide complete understanding generation DPOAEs , permit creation useful clinical test diagnose monitoring development NIHL .</detailed_description>
