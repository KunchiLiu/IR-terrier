	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Treating patient 's T cell laboratory may help T cell kill tumor cell put back body . Giving laboratory-treated T cell chemotherapy may effective treatment breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give laboratory-treated T cell second-line chemotherapy work treat woman HER2/neu-negative metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine phase II trial whether Her2Bi arm ATC infuse ChemoT patient HER2 0-2+ MBC locally advance , unresectable breast cancer would improve median PFS 2 month beyond median PFS 2 month estimate publish trial one stage design . - To determine overall survival ( OS ) patient HER2 0-2+ MBC locally advance , unresectable breast cancer receive aATC infusion ChemoT . - To confirm toxicity profile Her2Bi arm ATC give ChemoT patient HER2 0-2+ MBC . - To measure functional phenotypic change immune cell population ( blood tumor site , accessible ) consequence arm ATC ( tumor biopsies do KCI ) . Cytokine response , phenotypic marker differentiation , anti-tumor cytotoxicity examine . - OUTLINE : Patients receive second-line chemotherapy 4 course 4 month . Beginning early 1.5 week late 4 week chemotherapy , patient receive first infusion anti-CD3 x anti-HER2/neu bispecific antibody-armed activate T-cells ( ATC ) IV 30-60 minute week 3 week . Low dose granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( 250 µg/m2/twice per week ) start 3 day first aATC infusion end last dose aATC . Patients already protocol give choice add GM-CSF treatment regimen ( reconsenting ) continue treatment without GM-CSF . Patients receive boost anti-CD3 x anti-HER2/neu bispecific antibody-armed ATC 12 week 3rd ATC infusion . Blood tumor tissue sample may collect periodically biomarker analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically ≥ 2 year .</detailed_description>
