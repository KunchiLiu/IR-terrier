	<brief_summary>Patients certain type cancer require treatment high dos chemotherapy . A side effect high chemotherapy dos damage bone marrow blood immune system cell produce . Stem cell ( progenitor cell ) source blood cell . They form bone marrow ( spongy cavity center large bone ) . The stem cell receive signal direct become red cell , white cell platelet . This happen release blood stream . Stem cell circulate blood stream collect process call `` apheresis '' `` stem cell collection '' . The cell process frozen preserve . After chemotherapy give stem cell thaw give back intravenously ( IV : vein ) , like blood transfusion . The stem cell collection find way back bone marrow space , day , start produce blood immune cell normally would . Having stem cell collect return later call `` autologous transplant . '' Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma disease malignant cancer cell form lymph system . Autologous stem cell transplantation standard care chemo-sensitive relapse patient large cell lymphoma spread . Bendamustine work block growth cancer cell . It use management chronic lymphocytic leukemia follicular lymphoma . Bendamustine addition rituximab ( BR ) use several trial patient lymphoma encouraging result . Adequate peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) collection pre-requisite high dose therapy follow cell transplantation patient relapse lymphoma . Exposure previous multiple chemotherapy radiation treatment may lead poor mobilization PBSC . It know whether pre-treatment bendamustine adversely affect process PBSC mobilization harvest . On hand , assume high dose alkylating agent like cyclophosphamide may actually help break bond stem cell stromal cell marrow cavity hence may lead good mobilization PBSC .</brief_summary>
