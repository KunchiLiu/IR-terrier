	<brief_summary>Context . Faciocraniosynostoses present insufficient growth craniofacial skeleton due premature fusion skull facial suture . There prenatal condition functional ( risk raise intracranial pressure ) morphological consequence ( exorbitism , impairment upper respiratory airway ) , severity justifies early surgical treatment base craniofacial osteotomy osteodistraction technique . Distraction technique start unit eleven year ago , never cease modify : Recent improvement allow good correction exorbitism therefore reduction visual risk . But improvement respiratory function remain insufficient . The initial evaluation respiratory function base blood oxygenation monitoring , show real improvement . But routinely screen patient complete polysomnography examination past year , always reveal existence severe sleep apnea syndrome fail correct completely , although slightly improve . The aim PHRC protocol : - qualitative quantitative improvement respiratory status reinforce task force group include specialist genuine multidisciplinary approach . - A modification surgical technique include modification exist distraction device , increase number implanted device , maybe change surgical strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Study Faciocraniosynostosis Craniofacial Osteodistraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design . This monocentric study , patient control . Due extremely low incidence condition , foreseen include twelve patient per year , two year , represent 24 patient total minimum follow-up one year . Evaluation criterion . The main evaluation criterion polysomnography variable ( sleep apnea index , characterization obstructive versus central respiratory event , oxygenation pattern night ) , perform surgery ( 6 12 month post-op ) . The secondary criterion exorbitism correction analyse globe protrusion index rate infection . A multidisciplinary task force group already structure Necker Hospital . Expected result . We expect analyze correct sleep apnea syndrome . Many modification could make distractors , include removal activation rod , bioresorbable part , well modification surgical technique .</detailed_description>
