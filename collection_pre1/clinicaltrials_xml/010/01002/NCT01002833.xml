	<brief_summary>Plasmodium falciparum isolates display wide genetic diversity possibly different property induce immune response . These property could directly influence ability induce protective efficacy . Since 1998 experimental human malaria infection model Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center ( RUNMC ) successful answer question regard immunological mechanism human Pf infection . To date NF54 strain Pf deploy Nijmegen model . However , investigation heterologous Pf challenge highly informative basic understand induction immune response also provide essential model protective capacity test clinical development candidate malaria vaccine . Recently , parasite culture laboratory RUNMC able overcome technical hurdle produce infectious mosquito two genetically different isolates different geographical region increase portfolio Phase IIa trial . These isolates , PfA PfB compare NF54 strain parasitic , immunological clinical feature human .</brief_summary>
