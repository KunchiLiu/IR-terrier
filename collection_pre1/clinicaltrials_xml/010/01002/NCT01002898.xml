	<brief_title>Ritonavir-boosted Lopinavir Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -based highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) widely prescribe initial therapy treatment naïve HIV-infected patient , particularly many resource-constrained country . However , patient delayed detection treatment failure setting , virus often resistant exist nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) NNRTIs even fail first regimen . As consequence , construct potent salvage regimen combine 2 3 fully active drug exist drug class often impossible many resource-constrained country new agent , integrase inhibitor chemokine receptor antagonist , neither available affordable . Nevertheless , goal attain undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA remain mandatory . To date , several clinical study derive western country include 2 active drug clearly demonstrate effective therapeutic strategy antiretroviral ( ARV ) -experienced HIV-1 infected patient . Hence , use ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor salvage therapy consider option resource-constrained country limitation remain active NRTIs usually lead ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy salvage regimen . Among several previous report use ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor , ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy extensively study far . Different strategy ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy explore ; however , related clinical trial study regimen either treatment simplification strategy induction therapy treatment-naïve patient . A strategy use ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy salvage regimen available . On hand , previous study show continuation lamivudine emerge M184V mutation somewhat benefit immunological response clinical progression patient limit option salvage regimen . Moreover , neither additional mutation increase resistance antiretroviral drug . Thus , reason add lamivudine decrease viral fitness study regimen . The objective study assess 48-week treatment response , tolerability , steady-state minimum plasma concentration ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy salvage therapy HIV-1 infected patient fail antiretroviral regimen contain NRTI NNRTI .</detailed_description>
