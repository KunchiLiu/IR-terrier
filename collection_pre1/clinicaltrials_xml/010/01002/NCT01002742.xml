	<brief_summary>The study Phase III , randomize double blind , placebo control , trial evaluate addition Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) vs. placebo systemic corticosteroid initial therapy acute Graft Vs Host Disease ( GVHD ) . The primary endpoint GVHD free survival Day 56 post randomization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease Treatment ( BMT CTN 0802 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids use primary therapy acute GVHD many year . Historical publish unpublished data Johns Hopkins , M. D. Anderson , University Michigan others define expect 35 % -53 % complete response ( CR ) Day +28 corticosteroid therapy previously untreated patient acute GVHD . BMT CTN study 0302 ( NCT00224874 ) randomize Phase II study evaluate etanercept , mycophenolate mofetil , denileukin diftitox pentostatin addition corticosteroid . The result study suggested mycophenolate mofetil produce high rate CR Day 28 overall survival , support evaluation Phase III study . Day 56 GVHD-free survival four treatment arm ( combine corticosteroid one four study drug ) range 39-71 % across four study arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Acute GVHD develop allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use either bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell cord blood . Recipients nonmyeloablative myeloablative transplant eligible . Acute GVHD plan donor lymphocyte infusion plan T cell add back eligible . De novo acute GVHD require systemic therapy . GVHD define presence skin rash and/or persistent nausea , vomit , and/or diarrhea and/or cholestasis present context acute GVHD likely occur etiology drug rash , enteric infection , hepatotoxic syndrome unlikely rule . Note patient stage I II skin ( overall grade I ) isolate upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) involvement eligible treat physician deems systemic highdose corticosteroid treatment indicate . The patient must previous systemic immune suppressive therapy treatment acute GVHD except maximum 72 hour prior corticosteroid therapy &gt; 0.5mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent onset acute GVHD . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid le 0.25 mg/kg/day prednisone ( 0.2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone ) Day 28 therapy . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 500/µL . Written inform consent and/or assent patient , parent guardian . Documentation assent document education material provide , review , patient age 7 17 . Patients age eligible . Biopsy confirmation GVHD recommend , require . Enrollment delay biopsy pathology result unless use decide whether treat GVHD . Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil mycophenolic acid ( Myfortic ) within seven day screen enrollment . Patients uncontrolled infection exclude . If bacterial viral infection present , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . If fungal infection present , patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . Relapsed/persistent malignancy require rapid immune suppression withdrawal . Patients GVHD unplanned Donor Lymphocyte Infusion ( DLI ) , i.e. , DLI part original transplant therapy plan , DLI give treatment persistent recurrent malignancy transplantation . Patients unlikely available transplantation center Day 28 56 therapy . A clinical syndrome resemble de novo chronic GVHD develop time allotransplantation . Patients receive drug treatment GVHD . Patients receive methylprednisolone &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day ( 0.6 mg/kg/day prednisone ) within 7 day onset acute GVHD . If steroid therapy administer treatment nonGVHD related condition taper ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone ( 0.6 mg/kg/day prednisone ) seven day onset acute GVHD , patient eligible . Patients pregnant , breast feeding , , sexually active , unwilling use effective birth control duration study . Available evidence and/or expert consensus inconclusive inadequate determine infant risk use breastfeeding , therefore breast feeding patient eligible . Adults unable provide inform consent . Patients dialysis . Patients severe hepatic VenoOcclusive Disease ( VOD ) sinusoidal obstruction syndrome judgement treat physician expect normalized bilirubin Day 56 enrollment . Patients history intolerance/allergy MMF .</criteria>
