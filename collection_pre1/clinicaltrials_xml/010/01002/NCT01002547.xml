	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) chronic liver condition frequently associate type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) characterize insulin resistance hepatic fat accumulation . Liver fat may range simple steatosis severe steatohepatitis necroinflammation variable degree fibrosis ( nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH ) . Up 40 % patient NAFLD develop NASH recent series . Risk factor progression NASH unclear , appear common progress rapidly old individual , presence obesity T2DM . Because VA population San Antonio , Texas , frequently combine risk factor NASH felt study target high-risk population need . This study establish long-term efficacy ( primary endpoint : liver histology ) safety pioglitazone treatment VA patient T2DM NASH . All patient diagnose NASH offer lifestyle modification/weight loss ( current standard care ) randomize pioglitazone , vitamin E placebo 3 year . We believe high-risk population complication NASH , substantial benefit may expect early detection treatment . Specifically , arm : ) pioglitazone + vitamin E ; b ) vitamin E + placebo pioglitazone ; c ) placebo . Patients randomize one 3 arm , follow double-blind fashion 18 month . Patients offer continue open-label phase pioglitazone + vitamin E vitamin E alone another 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many NAFLD study find progression `` benign '' steatosis severe necroinflammation cirrhosis observe NASH varies widely depend upon initial stage diagnosis , well presence absence specific risk factor associate disease progression . The factor promote necroinflammation fibrosis development complex , frequently associate presence long-standing obesity , metabolic syndrome , particular , T2DM . Indeed , hyperglycemia identify single consistent factor disease progression many study ( Angulo et al , Hepatology 1999 ) Marceau et al , JCEM 1999 ; Luyckx et al , Obes Relat Metab Disord , 1998 ; Mofrad et al , Hepatology 2003 ; many others ; review Cusi , Current Diabetes Reports , 2009 ) . Given bad prognosis NASH patient T2DM , quite surprising study focus prevalence disease early screening treatment patient diabetes NASH . A prospective study conduct Gupte et al ( Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology , 2004 ) report biopsy-proven NASH 87 % diabetic , 22 % moderate severe disease . In retrospective analysis 44 patient T2DM worked-up NAFLD , Younussi et al also find cirrhosis prevalent diabetic vs. nondiabetics ( 25 % vs. 10 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) ( Hepatology 2004 ) . In recent year , diagnosis fatty liver make easy standardization liver magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) allow fast highly reproducible test NAFLD . With screen tool find NAFLD present &gt; 80 % unselected patient T2DM . In non-diabetic patient handful small study pair biopsy indicate fibrosis progress time 32-41 % patient NAFLD ( review Ali &amp; Cusi , Annals Medicine , 2009 ) . Obesity T2DM 2 prominent factor poor prognosis , elevate liver enzyme ( ALT AST/ALT ratio ) less value ( Mofrad et al , Hepatology 2003 ; Sorrentino et al , Hepatology 2004 ; Kunde et al , Hepatology 2005 ) . This study aim establish role pioglitazone vitamin E VA patient . Weight loss remain standard care therapy conclusively proven effective long-term . Pharmacological therapy modest effect include pentoxifylline , orlistat , cytoprotective agent , ursodeoxycholic acid lipid-lowering agent , insulin-sensitizers metformin thiazolidinediones yield provocative result small uncontrolled study NASH . Our research group recently demonstrate randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , pioglitazone treatment 6 month patient T2DM NASH significantly improve glycemic control , glucose tolerance , insulin sensitivity systemic inflammation ( Belfort et al , NEJM 2006 ) . This associated ~50 % decrease steatohepatitis ( p &lt; 0.001 ) 37 % reduction fibrosis within pioglitazone-treated group ( -37 % , p &lt; 0.002 ) , although fell short statistical significance compare placebo ( p=0.08 ) . Our result provide `` proof-of-principle '' pioglitazone may first agent capable alter natural history disease . However , definitive proof require establish safety efficacy large number subject treat long period time . The CRN conducting PIVENS trial ( www.ClinicalTrials.gov ; NCT 00063622 ) examine role pioglitazone , vitamin E placebo NASH , study design exclude diabetic , ~5 % patient Hispanic studied young population typical VA Medical Centers . Also , important multicenter trial perform in-depth metabolic measurement trial carry ( i.e. , insulin clamp glucose turnover measurement , indirect calorimetry , etc. ) . Understanding long-term impact thiazolidinediones vitamin E patient NASH T2DM , believe high risk liver disease progression , important implication treatment NASH drug selection treatment algorithm T2DM , insulin-sensitizer approach pioglitazone ( addition metformin ) would prefer therapy sulfonylureas insulin , proven effective treat NASH T2DM . However , currently common strategy treat T2DM insulin secretion-based approach ( i.e. , sulfonylureas and/or insulin ) little impact liver fat promotes weight gain without major improvement insulin sensitivity , promote chronic hyperinsulinemia self-perpetuating metabolic milieu promote hepatic lipogenesis fatty liver disease . Therefore , understand role pioglitazone vitamin combine , vitamin e alone ( plus pioglitazone placebo tablet control ) compare third arm placebo ( pioglitazone vitamin E ) important move field forward . Of note , study start San Antonio VAMC , TX ~60 % population Hispanic . However , Dr. Kenneth Cusi ( principal investigator ) move Gainesville VAMC , FL study transfer Gainesville recruitment continue new site prevalence Hispanics 5 % ( 75 % Caucasians , 20 % African American ) . Therefore , final patient mix reflect latter ethnic mix .</detailed_description>
