	<detailed_description>Omalizumab represent new therapeutic approach IgE-mediated disease . Omalizumab anti-IgE recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody design treat IgE-mediated disease reduce concentration free IgE antibody subject . The safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics single multiple dos Omalizumab study 2000 patient . Omalizumab compare placebo demonstrate reduce number asthma exacerbation , reduce concomitant medication burden , improve symptom severity improve quality life phase III study treatment patient allergic asthma , perennial allergic rhinitis seasonal allergic rhinitis . For information reader refer investigator brochure . Allergic ( IgE-mediated ) asthma characterize presence IgE antibodies common allergen . When allergen cross-link specific IgE bound high-affinity IgE ( FceRI ) receptor surface basophil mast cell , proinflammatory mediator release trigger perpetuate airway symptomatology . Omalizumab , anti-IgE mAb , bind Fc region form circulate IgE , regardless IgE specificity , prevent IgE-mediated response , downregulating FceRI expression mast cell basophil . The efficacy tolerability omalizumab demonstrate patient moderate-to-severe ( IgE-mediated ) asthma . Clinical benefit omalizumab observe serum free IgE level reduce 50 ng/mL less . Omalizumab dose base pretreatment total serum IgE level body weight , calculate use dose table . Omalizumab bind IgE reversibly form IgG-IgE complex . In binding , omalizumab push reaction toward IgG-IgE complex , incapable bind IgE receptor , thereby suppress free IgE reduce clinical symptom allergic asthma . However , although causal role IgE allergic disease well establish , relationship free IgE clinical symptom asthma accurately quantify . Recent study demonstrate omalizumab free IgE concentration correlate clinical outcome . In non responder omalizumab clinical symptom show random fluctuation around baseline without tendency toward improvement despite adequate suppression free IgE . In patient may ratio specific IgE total IgE inter-patient variability expression FceRI effector cell define whether patient respond omalizumab . This current study design evaluate mechanism responsiveness omalizumab measure free IgE , specific IgE level FceRI expression effector cell correlation clinical response . To characterize patient ' phenotype also evaluate fraction Nitric Oxide expire air ( FE-NO ) level eosinophils percentage induce sputum end study .</detailed_description>
