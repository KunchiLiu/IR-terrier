	<brief_summary>The use regional anesthesia nerve block diabetic patient peripheral neuropathy currently make case-by-case basis , also remain underlying uncertainty regard preferred technique likelihood block-related nerve injury . For many diabetic patient otherwise healthy nerve may receive general anesthesia instead regional anesthesia , thus give benefit associate latter technique , include decrease health complication superior analgesia follow operation . Ultrasound use identify target nerve guide needle insertion nerve block , may useful tool detect presence severity neuropathy prior block placement , recent study demonstrate statistically significant increase sonographic cross-sectional area posterior tibial nerve ( PTN ) diabetic patient abnormal motor transmission nerve conduction study . For regional anesthesiologist , ultimate goal detect peripheral neuropathy particular , diabetic neuropathy US avoid nerve injury . To , association US-detected diabetic neuropathy block-related nerve damage must first establish , hence purpose study . We aim examine whether cross-sectional area PTN assess preoperative US predict nerve injury assess worsen nerve conduction study follow PTN block inpatient schedule receive ankle block . A subgroup analysis perform diabetic patient . We hypothesize cross sectional area PTN correlate motor conduction velocity nerve conduction study ( NCS ) follow PTN block patient peripheral neuropathy . All eligible patient undergo NCS confirm exclude distal neuropathy . Patients without neuropathy exclude participation study . Also exclude diabetic patient neuropathy cause genetic , metabolic inflammatory disease well toxic agent drug induce . A systematic US examination PTN perform patient . After Block administration surgery day block success assess purpose present study , patient block successful exclude intervention data analysis . Eight week surgery , study patient return hospital repeat NCS US .</brief_summary>
