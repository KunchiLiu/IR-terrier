	<brief_summary>Fingers amputation common injury among patient arrive Emergency Department . Fingertips amputation classify 2nd 3rd zone , accordance Rosenthal 's classification ( solum unguis ) , constitute large proportion . The treatment aim restore pulp sensitivity good subcutaneous fat tissue . The usual care amputation surgical treatment : consist pulp reconstruction flap ( example palmar V-Y advancement flap Atazoy ) . These technique involve hospital admission , brachial plexus anaesthesia , surgical approach cicatrix donor site morbidity , postoperative care , post-surgical pain management . And course attention must pay risk postoperative complication relate either anaesthesia and/or surgery , like necrosis , infection , others . We develop nonoperative treatment fingertip amputation : occlusive dressing . It 's technique know twenty year , currently develop team SOS main Professor Liverneaux Strasbourg Professor Obert Besançon . It consist occlusive application two Tegaderm® , plastic dressing . Then finger macerates anaerobic medium , could develop uncomfortable smell induce maceration process . The first result describe preclinical study two group look satisfy functional aspect ( sensibility ) aesthetic component ( preservation finger length curve ) , well heal occurs without infection . Moreover , length treatment three four week , cost low comparison cost surgery . Nevertheless technique still common , report five reference literature [ Mennen &amp; Al. , Farrell &amp; Al. , Lee &amp; Al. , Allen &amp; Al. , Tago Hiroyuk &amp; Al. ] . On hand , mechanism action and/or active component occlusive dress yet object extend study . An explanatory hypothesis anaerobic germ and/or growth factor might play active role process . However , identify yet . The aim study validate clinical biological criterion non operative method compare surgical treatment . The study hold Hand Department University Hospital Strasbourg , direction Pr Liverneaux . It imply collaboration laboratory medical bacteriology direct Pr Piemont , research department INSERM ( Parogène laboratory ) focus biochemistry . From clinical point view , certain number objective functional criterion measure : pain evaluate visual analogic scale DN4 scale ; functional disability measure french version Disability Arm Shoulder Hand Dubert ; pulpar 3D volume calculate numerical picture computerize file , cutaneous depth measure 3D U.S ; tactile sensibility test standardized monofilaments Weber 's test dermatoglyphic handsides compare . In addition , subjective feeling patient record visual analogical scale satisfaction . The purpose biological component study put light identify component active process . This perform direct examination bacteriological culture , look anaerobic , aerobic germ yeasts.The biochemical study first include non specific search growth factor , cytokine interleukin . In second step , specific research undertaken necessary accordance result first investigation . By study , investigator would like scientifically confirm efficiency method objective well subjective criterion , identify underlie biomechanisms process .</brief_summary>
