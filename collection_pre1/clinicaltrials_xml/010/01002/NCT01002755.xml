	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination lenalidomide ofatumumab help control CLL SLL patient already receive therapy . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Ofatumumab Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Ofatumumab design bind surface type white blood cell call B-cells destroy . The cancer cell B-CLL/SLL B-cells . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , receive ofatumumab vein 4 hour follow time : - On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 . - On Day 1 Cycles 2-6 . - On Day 1 every even cycle begin Cycle 8 ( Cycles 8,10,12 , ) . Beginning Day 9 Cycle 1 , take lenalidomide mouth every day . Swallow lenalidomide capsule whole glass water time day . Do break , chew , open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide seek emergency medical care need contact study staff right away . Any unused lenalidomide return instructed RevAssist® program . On Days 1-14 Cycle 1 , take allopurinol help prevent side effect . You take mouth 1 glass water 1 time day . If doctor think need , continue take allopurinol . If doctor think need , may take aspirin low molecular weight heparin help prevent blood clot . If doctor think need , may take medicine help prevent return hepatitis B infection . You drink least 8-10 cup water day first 14 day Cycle 1 ( include 1 medication ) . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week first 5 week , 1 time every 2 week ( dose lenalidomide change ) , every 4 week , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 28 Cycles 3 , 7 , 13 , 19 , 23 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record - Urine collect routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease . If continue past 23 cycle , every 6-12 cycle ( + 14 day ) : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy aspirate check status disease . If doctor think need , extra blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test time study . If type hepatitis B call HBcAb , risk hepatitis B infection treatment ofatumumab . Every 2 month , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon time ) drawn check hepatitis B infection . Pregnancy Testing : If woman able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test 1 time week first 28 day study , every 28 day study , stop study , 28 day study . If woman able become pregnant menstrual cycle irregular , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test 1 time week first 28 day , every 14 day study , stop study , 14 28 day study . Length Study : You study 2 year . You take study early intolerable side effect disease get bad . If doctor think benefit , may able continue take lenalidomide long benefitting . If continue , follow schedule dose study visit schedule . Follow-Up : About 6 month go study , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . You need come M. D. Anderson blood draw , perform local doctor . The study staff call every 3 month unless begin new treatment ask . This phone call take 2-3 minute . After study , hepatitis B , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon time ) drawn every 2-3 month 6 month last dose ofatumumab . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve treatment multiple myeloma myelodysplastic syndrome . Ofatumumab FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . The combination lenalidomide ofatumumab treat CLL SLL investigational . Up 36 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
