	<brief_summary>The aim study determine whether use CGAOtm software associate decrease 90-day mortality compare use standard care method glucose control target blood glucose level inferior 180 mg/dl . The CGAOtm software design assist physician nurse achieve tight glucose control ( define target blood glucose level 80 110 mg/dl ) critically ill patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperglycemia response critical illness long associated adverse outcome . In 2001 , first `` Leuven study '' , randomize control trial conduct surgical intensive care patient compare strategy base nurse-driven protocol insulin therapy order maintain normal blood glucose level [ 80 - 110 mg/dl ] standard care define time intravenous insulin start blood glucose level exceed 215 mg/dl adjust keep blood glucose level 180 200 mg/dl , show reduction hospital mortality one third . The result trial enthusiastically receive rapidly incorporate guideline , Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2004 , endorse internationally numerous professional society . However , subsequent randomize controlled trial fail confirm mortality benefit intensive insulin therapy among critically ill patient , stress hypoglycemia common . Moreover Normoglycemia Intensive Care Evaluation - Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation ( NICE-SUGAR ) study , international multicentre trial involve 6104 patient , large trial insulin therapy date , show low 90-day mortality control group target blood glucose level inferior 180 mg/dl compare intervention group tight glucose control [ 80 - 110 mg/dl ] . In addition , many study meta-analyses report high rate hypoglycemia tight glucose control . Consequently , considerable controversy emerge whether tight glucose control warrant critically ill patient especially tight glucose control ( without appropriate computer protocol ) cause significant increase nurse workload . The conflict result first Leuven study NICE-SUGAR study could explain numerous difference two trial : specific method ( algorithm , compliance nurse physicians recommendation , etc ) use achieve tight glucose control randomize control trial could major issue . Several experimental observational study highlight possible negative impact glucose variability ( large fluctuation blood glucose possibly undetected hypoglycemia hypokalemia alternate hyperglycemia ) implement tight glucose control , due intrinsic property algorithms use , technical factor ( error measurement blood glucose level lack control intravenous insulin therapy ) human factor ( delay perform glucose measurement non respect recommendation base clinical expertise consequence insufficient training induce lack confidence algorithm inexperienced nurse ) . Therefore , remain concern best way achieve glucose control ICU reduce impact conclusion recent randomize controlled trial tight glucose control : negative result due concept , tight glucose control intensive insulin therapy critically ill patient order reduce toxicity high blood glucose level , negative result mainly due specific method use achieve tight glucose control ? In case method use clinical trial never test numerical patient accord exist validated model ( SILICO expertise ) implement clinical practice real patient . Particularly , whether use clinical computerize decision-support system ( CDSS ) design achieve tight glucose control various ICU setting , fine-tuned reduce glucose variability , without increase incidence severe hypoglycemia nurse workload , impact outcome patient stay least three day ICU remain test . Among different CDSS , CGAOtm software develop standardize different aspect glucose control ICU set base 1 ) explicit replicable recommendation follow blood glucose level measurement concern insulin rate time next measurement , 2 ) reminder alert 3 ) various graphic tool , trend , individual on-line data aim increase confidence nursing staff computer protocol therefore adherence , reduce necessary training time , give physician nurse way control tight glucose control process whole ICU stay . Moreover , CGAOtm software design take account irregular sampling , saturation , precision stability issue . The aim study evaluate capability CGAOtm software reduce 90-day mortality mixed ICU population patient require intensive care least three day . Sample size power calculation . The expected cause 90-day mortality control group 25 % ( identical observe cause 90-day mortality control group NICE-SUGAR trial ) . Considering cause 90-day mortality experimental group ( computer protocol group ) expect 22 % ( absolute reduction 3 % ) , consider alpha risk beta risk respectively 0.05 0.20 three intermediate analysis perform accord O'Brien-Fleming design , 3,211 patient per treatment arm need recruit participate 60 centre , locate France .</detailed_description>
