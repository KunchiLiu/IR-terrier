	<brief_title>Prevention Arrhythmia Device Infection Trial ( PADIT Pilot )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection occur surgery either pacemaker implantable defibrillation serious consequence . These infection common see many 2-3 % high-risk patient . Doctors use antibiotic prevent infection , know much often give antibiotic get best effect . It know whether additional antibiotic operation would reduce risk infection . This research study compare two different way use common antibiotic prevent infection follow device procedure . One way standard approach single dose surgery way use antibiotic . We know either way well . The purpose study therefore , compare two type antibiotic therapy plan well understand one effective prevent infection . This study provide ability evaluate feasibility ( i.e . site activation , enrollment , compliance , drop-out ) generate proof concept large clinical trial 12,000 patient 25 Canadian Hospitals implant ICDs , submit CIHR . Additionally , study support continue initiative network physician investigator ( Canadian Heart Rhythm Society Device Advisory Committee - CHRS DAC ) collaborate address arrhythmia procedure related clinical trial answer simple clinical question focus initially safety issue .</detailed_description>
