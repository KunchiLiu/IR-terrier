	<brief_title>A Thin Catheter For Hystrosalpingography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysterosalpingography ( HSG ) remain one reliable method study tubal patency uterine cavity ( 1-3 ) . The relative indication importance HSG laparoscopy diagnosis tubal factor infertility extensively discuss . Recently multicenter randomize control trial ( 4 ) demonstrate routine use HSG early stage infertility work , prior laparoscopy dye , influence cumulative pregnancy rate compare routine use laparoscopy dye alone . However , HSG efficient method less invasive less costly laparoscopy ( 5 ) , transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy ( 6 ) . The main disadvantage HSG unable confirm adhesion , endometriosis painful procedure ( 7,8 ) . Different cannula catheter try reduce pain Rubin cannula ( 9 ) , Jorcho cannula ( 10 ) , Whitehead cannula Foley catheter ( 11 ) . Minimal difference degree pain find balloon catheter compare cervical cup ( 12 ) . General local medication try alleviate pain procedure . ( 3,13 ) . HSG widely practice country , however , cost effective reason , standard metal cannula method use hospital . It painful procedure require grasp cervix tenaculum induce cervical dilatation introduction cannula . The aim pilot study develop simple painless technique HSG use thinner normal catheter , without grasp cervix tenaculum . Leakage dye cervix prevent press portiovaginalis cervix use vaginal speculum . This technique perform HSG novel one described previously medical literature .</detailed_description>
