	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder associate several sleep Polysomnograph ( PSG ) finding : ( 1 ) impair sleep continuity ; ( 2 ) non-REM ( NREM ) change ; ( 3 ) enhance rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep . The first two pattern common psychiatric disorder , REM pattern characteristic depression , phase-advance theory accepted psychiatrist . Many researcher focus biological rhythm investigate etiological pathophysiology depression , think depression cure sleep abnormality ameliorate . It well known antidepressant treat depression 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) neuron . 5-HT also affect regulation sleep-wake cycle sleep microarchitecture . Many all-night PSG study show tricyclic antidepressant ameliorate sleep architecture abnormality depression produce rapid suppression REM sleep . Compared TCAs , SSRIs generally less sedating high selectivity serotonin receptor . SSRIs suppress REM sleep delay REM latency , increase awakening reduce SWS time . One PSG study show sertraline minimally increase sleep efficiency reduces nocturnal wakefulness time , may benefit depressive patient . However , study compare sleep architecture 12 week pharmacotherapy , tolerance disturbance sleep architecture antidepressant appear develop several week treatment . Sertraline great potency 5-HT reuptake well well selectivity 5-HT reuptake relative NE reuptake SSRIs , relative selectivity sertraline inhabit 5-HT reuptake relative DA reuptake somewhat less SSRIs . So chance exhibit well effect sleep architecture depressive patient . Finally , difficult determine unique phenomenon sertraline genuine characteristic tolerance 12-week treatment , crucial ass effect sertraline sleep architecture acute treatment . We hypothesize sertraline could suppress REM sleep , little damage sleep architecture depressive patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An 8-week , Open-label Study Evaluate Effect Sertraline Polysomnogram Depressive Patients With Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[ Abstract ] Purpose study : To evaluate effect sertraline polysomnographic ( PSG ) variables clinical improvement treatment depressive patient insomnia . Methods use : The study design 8-week open-label trial . Patients diagnose major depressive disorder . Their Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD ) score 18 , HRSD-sleep disturbance score 3 . After 7-day wash-out period 2 night PSG ( first night adaptive second night baseline ) , 31 depressive patient administer sertraline 50 mg 8 1st day . The dosage sertraline would titrate 8-week treatment , maximum low 200 mg/day . The primary endpoint change PSG variable baseline 56th Day . The secondary endpoint change subjective sleep quality clinical performance baseline 56th Day . Their sleep quality evaluate Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , clinical performance evaluate HRSD Clinical Globe Impression ( CGI ) . Summary result contain real data appropriate statistical assessment : The Intent-to-Treat analysis include 31 subject . The final dosage titrate 130.6±47.8 mg/day . The Rapid Eye Movement ( REM ) sleep latency prolong significantly 1st day throughout 8-week treatment . The percentage REM sleep decrease significantly 1st day , increase gradually along follow treatment . AI reach high level 1st day ( 13.8±7.2 ) , decrease along follow treatment . SL decrease significantly reach normal range ( &lt; 30minutes ) visit 14th day . The percentage stage 3 increase gradually , become high 14th , 28th , 56th day . HRSD score similar baseline 1st day , become significantly low 14th , 28th , 56th day . Similar pattern show CGI . Scores HRSD-sleep disturbance , PSQI , ESS decrease gradually throughout treatment . The sleep latency multiple sleep latency test maintain stable throughout treatment . The reduce score rate HRSD CGI-GI significantly correlate reduce score rate REM latency visit , also significantly correlate sleep latency , sleep efficiency , stage 3 visit . Further , significant correlation show reduce score rate HRSD 56th day reduce score rate REM latency 1st day ( r=-0.733 , P=0.003 ) . Conclusions : Sertraline effective antidepressant , effectiveness relationship reduction REM latency 8-week treatment . Further , final clinical improvement could predict extent shorten REM latency first night . So suppression REM sleep might key mechanism antidepressive [ 1 ] . On hand , Sertraline little alert property without sleep disturbance treatment [ 2 ] . This property sertraline must benefit remission depression , remission contribute sleep improvement turn . It virtuous cycle depressive treatment .</detailed_description>
