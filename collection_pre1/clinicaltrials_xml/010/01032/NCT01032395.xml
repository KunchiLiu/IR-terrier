	<brief_summary>This phase III , randomize , control , open label study two vaccine regimen . The study assess relative safety immunogenicity vaccine regimens compare adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted formulation A ( H1N1 ) inactivate influenza virus vaccine subject Chronic Pulmonary Disease , Chronic Heart Disease , Diabetes Mellitus , compare safety immunogenicity data contemporaneously enrol control group age-comparable , healthy subject . Because certain individual may hypo-responsive influenza vaccination , additional study high-risk group warrant order determine optimal vaccine formulation dose schedule prevention novel H1N1 virus infection .</brief_summary>
