	<brief_summary>The main objective present study assess impact double fortified salt contain iron iodine work performance ( productivity ) woman plantation worker India . Efficacy study show salt double-fortified iodine iron significantly reduce incidence rate iron-deficiency anemia ( IDA ) iodine-deficiency disorder . Double-fortified salt ( DFS ) prepare mix microencapsulated iron compound conventionally iodated salt ( Yuan et al , 2008 ) . Iron deficiency anemia affect work productivity physical activity . Many study show individual low Hb receive iron supplement , work performance improve markedly . Animal study demonstrate iron deficient anemic rat low work tolerance measure oxygen consumption adult rat normal Hb level ( Ohira et al , 1981 ) . Several human study demonstrate effect iron supplementation endurance capacity work productivity woman ( Zhu Haas , 1997 , 1998 ; Edgerton et al. , 1979 ) . Many human study also examine possible linkage iron deficiency concurrent cognitive behavioral outcome . Iron supplementation effective reduce iron-deficiency anemia would also result good behavioral developmental outcome .

This study assess iron status physical mental performance 2 time point , approximately 10 month control intervention take place tea estates Panighatta Tea Garden near Siliguri , West Bengal . Subjects woman 18 50 year age actively employ full time tea picker . The study require 2 experimental group subject identify : ) experimental group consumes double fortify salt ( DFS ) contain iron + iodine , b ) control group consume iodize salt ( IS ) .</brief_summary>
