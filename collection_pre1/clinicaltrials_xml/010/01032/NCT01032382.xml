	<brief_title>Safety , Efficacy Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Study WR 279,396 Versus Paromomycin Treatment Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( Peru-PK )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-site , randomize , double-blind , two group trial assess PK , safety efficacy WR 279,396 Topical Cream Paromomycin Topical Cream subject CL . Subjects screen period 28 day eligibility include parasitology confirmation ulcerative CL . Subjects randomize target 1:1 ratio receive either WR 279,396 ( 15 % paromomycin + 0.5 % gentamicin topical cream ) ( target n=15 ) Paromomycin Topical Cream ( 15 % paromomycin topical cream ) ( target n=15 ) topical application CL lesion daily 20 day . Because primary objective trial determine PK age group , subject stratify age : 5-11 yr , 12-17 yr , ≥ 18 yr least 6 PK subject age stratum 18 total subject randomize age range . A target 30 subject complete PK part study goal . Any subject complete PK portion study replace another subject age group give treatment assignment maintain balance . Safety assess monitor adverse event ( AEs ) , lesion site reaction , vital sign , blood creatinine level . The primary efficacy analysis evaluation index lesion secondary efficacy analyse include lesion . Lesions also examine parasite negativity classical mean ( positive culture promastigotes microscopic identification amastigotes stain lesion tissue ) Day 21 . In adult subject , Days 1 20 , blood collect prior topical cream application 0.5h , 1h , 2h , 3h , 4h ± 5 minute 8h , 12h , 24h ± 15 minute completion cream application determine plasma level paromomycin gentamicin calculate PK parameter . Thus , last blood draw series occur Day 21 . In addition , blood collect Days 4 , 7 , 12 , 17 ± 1 day study drug application examine trough plasma level paromomycin gentamicin . A follow-up plasma sample PK analysis also obtain Day 28 ± 2 day . Subjects age 18 year total four blood sample draw . The first drawn pre-application second drawn 4 hour ± 5 minute completion application topical cream Study Day 1 . The third drawn pre-application fourth 4 hour ± 5 minute completion application topical cream Study Day 20 . Subjects receive Paromomycin Topical Cream expect blood level gentamicin , study blind , plasma specimen test paromomycin gentamicin . The index lesion ( primary ulcerate ) ulcerated lesion assess clinical response measurement length width area ulceration . A lesion consider completely cured 100 % re-epithelialization observe ( i.e. , measurement ulceration 0 x 0 mm ) . Non-ulcerated lesion also measure monitor total area exposure lesion study drug evaluate cure ( i.e. , absence sign active lesion ) . Subjects in-clinic follow-up weekly ( Days 28 , 35 , 42 , 49 , 56 , 63 ± 2 day ) completion treatment safety assessment , lesion measurement , lesion photograph . On Day 21 , index lesion adult subject completely re-epithelialized assessed parasite classical mean ( positive culture promastigotes microscopic identification amastigotes stain lesion tissue ) . An interim analysis data collect subject randomize complete nominal Day 63 follow-up perform make decision final design Phase 3 trial . Subjects continue follow outcome Day 100 168 ± 14 day . A final analysis outcomes long term followup period complete subject perform trial close . Follow-up evaluation include AEs , medication use , lesion measurement , lesion photograph . Patients fail therapy ( see definition failure ) may administer rescue therapy discretion patient 's personal physician .</detailed_description>
