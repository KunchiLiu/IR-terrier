	<brief_summary>The PropR study evaluate sense ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) bipolar extend bipolar configuration , order evaluate use interchangeably care patient . In addition , follow evaluation R wave amplitude time would allow u determine whether one configuration likely associate change . This understanding would important select proper configuration time implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Sensed R Wave Bipolar Extended Bipolar Configurations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Sensing bipolar extend bipolar configuration . However , sense bipolar time likely decrease compare extend bipolar . Objectives : 1 . To compare bipolar sense extended bipolar sense VF . 2 . Compare sense bipolar extend bipolar time . Methods : 1 . This study randomize comparison bipolar extend bipolar sensing . As per usual standard care , end ICD implantation two sensing test VF perform . Patients randomize sense VF device . Each patient undergo test one randomize configuration follow second test configuration . After test time implant , patient see one month follow . Sensing configuration reevaluate time sinus rhythm . 2 . Each patient serve control , data sense configuration obtain VF time implant . During test signal type record simultaneously ICD . The primary endpoint duration sense ( time detection ) VF time implant . 3 . The secondary endpoint sense sinus rhythm one month . 4 . The patient population include approximately 30-50 volunteer age &gt; 18 , male female , ischemic nonischemic cardiomyopathy , primary secondary implant indication . 5 . Patients recruit evaluated defibrillator implant . 6 . Inclusion criterion : age &gt; 18 ability give inform consent , expect live one year , indication defibrillator implant pacemaker dependent . Patients either ischemic nonischemic cardiomyopathy . 7 . Exclusion criterion : age &lt; 18 , inability give inform consent , life expectancy le one year , pacemaker dependence , use preexist lead sensing , condition would preclude ICD test end implant . Patients undergo upgrade ICD pacemaker also exclude . In addition , patient inherit arrhythmias ion channel relate arrhythmias exclude study . 8 . Withdrawal criterion : inability implant device , implant lead RV apex , make follow appointment ( live state ) , patient death time implant , elevate DFT ( &lt; 10 J margin DFT maximum output device ) require additional procedure , subcutaneous array etc . 9 . Duration patient participation would one month . 10 . Duration study would one year . Procedures : 1 . Procedures follow would include screen eligible patient undergo implant Medtronic defibrillator either primary secondary prevention . If patient meet inclusion criterion would undergo informed consent willing enrol study . Defibrillator implant test would perform per usual practice implant physician . The RV lead place RV apex usual regular implantation device . However , lead place elsewhere , patient need withdraw study . 2 . When VF induction perform , sense configuration would test randomized fashion , unblinded operator . The untested configuration would test second VF induction . Both test would perform sensitivity set 1.2mV , number interval detection ( NID ) 24/32 . Final programming polarity leave initially test polarity ( first DFT test ) , unless operator see need program differently patient safety reason . 3 . Medtronic defibrillator sense configuration available use . Data collection perform Dr. Tolat , Dr. Berns , Dr. Lippman , Dr. Dell'Orfano , study coordinator involve study . A data collection form spreadsheet keep use collect data analysis . Follow perform one month post implant office . Risk Analysis : 1 . Anticipated risk anticipate usual ICD implant . To date , usual implant include induction VF analysis sense VF evaluation defibrillation threshold delivery shock . 2 . There expect increase exposure risk perform study . 3 . Potential benefit would include gather additional information sense VF configuration instead perform two sense test one configuration . This may directly benefit patient allow reprogramming defibrillator without bring patient back hospital testing . Data Analysis : 1 . Data collection include patient information keep database name keep confidential . Patients identified number keep privacy law practice . In addition usual patient characteristic , data variable collect configuration include : R wave amplitude sinus rhythm , time detection VF , total episode duration ( time Vfib detection charge deliver ) , number `` drop out '' ( undersensing ) VF , follow R wave amplitude one month . 2 . Statistical Methods compare bipolar sense configuration extend bipolar configuration baseline , sense VF ( measure `` drop '' , time detection ) , follow amplitude R wave one month . 3 . The current expected sample size pilot study 30 patient . This may require reevaluation depend result time interim analysis .</detailed_description>
