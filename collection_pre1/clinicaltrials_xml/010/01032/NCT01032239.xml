	<brief_title>SISTERS : Spasticity In Stroke Study - Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , control open-label parallel group study demonstrate efficacy benefit ITB Therapy BMT post-stroke patient severe spasticity reach therapy goal treatment intervention . In order evaluate efficacy benefit ITB Therapy BMT post-stroke patient , two-arm parallel group design apply . Patients equally randomize one two treatment arm : 1 . ITB Therapy arm ; 2 . BMT arm The study consist run-in phase 21 day BMT treatment arm 2-25 day ITB Therapy treatment arm , follow 6 month active trial . The BMT treatment arm receive combination oral antispastic medication physiotherapy . Patients must prescribe least one combination follow oral antispastic medication : oral baclofen , tizanidine , diazepam ( benzodiazepine ) dantrolene . Following run-in phase , patient enter 6 month active trial . The ITB Therapy treatment arm receive combination ITB Therapy physiotherapy . During run-in phase , test intrathecal baclofen perform evaluate response patient . Patients fulfil test success criterium implant Medtronic SynchroMed®II infusion system . Following implant , patient enter 6 month active trial , include 6 week titration phase , time oral antispastic medication must gradually reduce complete discontinuation end titration period . During 6 month active trial , patient assess 3 6 month . All primary secondary endpoint assessment perform blinded assessor . The total study duration expect 60 month , include 39 month enrollment period . The total duration per patient approximately 7 month ( approximately 1 month run-in period follow 6 month active treatment ) .</detailed_description>
