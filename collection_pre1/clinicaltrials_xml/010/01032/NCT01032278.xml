	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn certain biomarker test blood sample help detect heart damage may occur chemotherapy . Biomarkers chemical `` marker '' find blood may relate heart function . High level marker may link heart problem heart damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Using Biomarkers Detect Identify Cardiotoxicity Describe Treatment ( PREDICT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Visits : If find eligible take part study , study test procedure perform day visit chemotherapy treatment . These study visit occur every 3-4 week apart . The exact number time visit depend schedule chemotherapy visit occur . You doctor discuss best chemotherapy treatment schedule . At chemotherapy visit , receive chemotherapy follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn biomarker test . At begin every third cycle chemotherapy ask complete questionnaire symptom may experience . Follow-Up Visit : At 6 month start chemotherapy follow test procedure perform : - You complete symptom questionnaire . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn biomarker test . - You ECG . - You ECHO MUGA scan . End-of-Study Visit : At 12 month start chemotherapy end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You complete symptom questionnaire . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn biomarker test . - You ECG . - You ECHO MUGA scan . At time study , doctor think necessary , ECG and/or ECHO MUGA scan . If stop receiving chemotherapy participation study , still ask complete test procedure list 12-month ( end-of-study visit ) visit . Other test procedure schedule study may perform long receive chemotherapy treatment . Your study doctor research staff go information happens . Research Test Results : The primary biomarkers test study BNP TnI . Both BNP TnI look function heart . The BNP TnI test MD Anderson . The result biomarker test keep separately tests result , affect treatment way . The reason biomarker test result would share cancer doctor would study doctor think result show heart problem . In case , study doctor contact right away advise next ( example , come clinic ) . You refer cardiologist ( heart doctor ) study doctor decide necessary . In addition biomarkers test study , ECHOs study , image ECHOs may copy DVD send University Pennsylvania review relate research heart damage cause anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Before send ECHOs University Pennsylvania MD Anderson remove personal identifier ( name , date birth , age , medical record number ) include ECHO image DVD . Length Study Participation : Your study participation last 12 month date first chemotherapy treatment . You follow visit 6 month date first chemotherapy end study visit 12 month date first chemotherapy treatment . This end participation study . This investigational study . At time , biomarker test study use research . Its use detect heart damage consider investigational . Up 830 patient take part multicenter study . Up 200 enrolled Harris Health System MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
