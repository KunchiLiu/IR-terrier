	<brief_summary>After surgical treatment , numerous trial use early postoperative enteral parenteral nutritional support attempt , order reduce morbidity mortality . Although difficult compare among heterogeneous intervention , successful , fact generally attribute time intervention . On hand , nutrients become `` conditionally essential '' certain stressful circumstance , call nutraceuticals , incorporate nutritional formulation . Both fact prompt idea pre perioperative nutrition support , use specific formulation call `` immune enhancing '' formula , contain arginine , nucleotide , glutamine omega3 fatty acid vary concentration . The provision nutraceuticals prior early surgical , particularly oncologic surgery , theoretically permit obtain adequate circulate tissue concentration moment need . Exclusive postoperative provision substance would able replenish depot provide adequate immune response wound healing surgery . However , regard preoperative approach , still know patient benefit ( less severely malnourish ) , specific nutrient ( ) responsible positive effect , precise timing nutrient provide . The present study aim demonstrate immune-enhancing formula superior standard enteral product reduce postoperative nutrition-related complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Benefits Preoperative Nutrition Support With Enteral Immune-enhancing Formulas Surgical Oncology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS : Patients receive enteral nutrition support immune-enhancing formula ( contain high concentration arginine , glutamine omega 3 fatty acid compare standard polymeric formula ) 7 day major oncological surgical procedure , low incidence nutritional-related postoperative complication , compare patient without preoperative nutritional supplementation supplement standard formula . OBJECTIVES : - To put practice routine nutritional assessment every patient go submit major digestive oncologic surgery - In patient evaluate adherence tolerance enteral drink , compare immune-enhancing standard polymeric formulation , 7 day prior surgery - To compare frequency postoperative nutrition-related complication ( infection , anastomotic leak hospital length stay ) , among non-supplemented patient receive preoperative immune-enhancing standard polymeric formula . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Every patient propose major elective digestive oncologic surgery invite nutritional assessment . Exclusion criterion emergency surgery renal failure ( serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL ) . Some patient accept able attend several reason , however assess clinical nutritionist day admission , enter OR , follow study patient , consider control group . Nutritional assessment include clinical story , dietary recall , Global Subjective Assessment ( GSA ) , calculation percent weight loss respect habitual weight , anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , body mass index ) hand grip strength . Functional involvement study Karnofsky score . Among laboratory analysis total protein , albumin , creatinine , BUN blood cell lymphocyte count include . All data register special chart empty computational data base . After nutritional assessment , well nourish undernourished patient instructed consume enteral drink , orally gastrostomy enteral feeding tube , 7 day surgery . Seventy patient receive 1 lt per day standard polymeric formula ( Fresubin 22 % , give 1000 Kcal 35 g protein , contain free aminoacid omega fatty acid , contains glutamine arginine concentration milk protein . In order increase protein intake , 50 g /día Proteinex R add group ) . The 70 patient instructed consume 600 ml special immune-enhancing formula plus 20 g glutamine ( Supportan R + Glutamine plus R , contain 900 Kcal 60 g protein/day , 24.4 g glutamine , 2,2 g arginine 4.4 g omega 3 fatty acid , low volume due high energy density ) . Both product enrich essential vitamin mineral . The enteral formula assign randomized computer-generated number , open way . Patients agree participate , enough time operation , tolerate product drink less 100 cc/day consider control subject . The enteral product sell patient directly oncologic clinic , prize , low marketing prize , due participation Fresenius-Kabi protocol . However patient mean , receive free . All patient instruct maintain previous diet , add enteral supplement , complete requirement tube feed standard specific formulation ( e.g . diabetic formulation ) . All patient follow entire postoperative period , register day stay critical ward , time mechanical ventilation , day fever , infection ( wound , intra-abdominal , pulmonary , urinary , etc ) , anastomotic leak time hospitalization . The participation Fresenius-Kabi consist : - Paying enteral formula , thus avoid payment patient ( consider Fundación Arturo Lopez Perez private institution , patient must pay treatment , accord health insurance , usually exclude nutritional product ) . - Collaboration data registry ( nutritional assessment , adherence supplement , postoperative complication , etc . ) due incorporation one professional ( nutritionist ) study .</detailed_description>
