	<brief_title>Observation Versus Occlusion Therapy Intermittent Exotropia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent exotropia ( IXT ) common form childhood-onset exotropia incidence 32.1 per 100,000 child 19 year age . Intermittent exotropia characterize exotropia constant mainly present distance may also present near . Many case IXT treat use non-surgical intervention , part-time occlusion , fusional vergence exercise , over-minus lens . The rationale intervention may improve ability control IXT preserve stereoacuity , thereby potentially address visual function social concern , may delay eliminate need surgical correction IXT . Nevertheless , natural history IXT unknown many case know whether withhold treatment may fact allow spontaneous resolution improvement IXT , make non-surgical surgical intervention unnecessary . Moreover , although non-surgical treatment IXT commonly prescribe , treatment subject rigorous study efficacy improve visual function social concern remain unclear . One aim present study well understand natural history IXT . Available report natural history IXT disagree progression disease . A 1966 study von Noorden ( cite von Noorden Campos ) find average 3.5 year follow-up , 75 % 51 patient show sign IXT progression , 9 % show change , 16 % improve without therapy . A 1968 retrospective study Hiles et al find minimum 6 year follow observation nonsurgical treatment , 81 % 48 patient show change angle deviation . The result recent retrospective study show report majority case improve time , others report case remain stable , still others report case deteriorate . It therefore unclear proportion patient , leave untreated , likely deteriorate , improve , remain stable time . Natural history data acquire study help determine proportion patient change time , whether associate prognostic indicator deterioration improvement . Such data enable good identification patient IXT likely benefit treatment treatment likely unnecessary , also improve quality medical advice parent regard likely progression disease , thus alleviate anxiety . The aim form non-surgical treatment IXT improve strength and/or quality binocular single vision either eliminate suppression , increase awareness diplopia , and/or increase positive fusional amplitude . Commonly use non-surgical treatment method include : occlusion , fusional vergence exercise ( sometimes know vision therapy orthoptics ) , over-minus lens . When surveyed 1990 , member American Association Pediatric Ophthalmology Strabismus report occlusion commonly use form non-surgical treatment . More recently ( 2008 ) , poll investigator group reveal occlusion widely prescribe non-surgical treatment child affect IXT . Occlusion think work interrupt development eliminate already present suppression , adaptation avoid diplopia IXT . Persistent entrench suppression prevents normal binocular vision may lead permanent loss stereoacuity . If successful , occlusion may result improved binocular sensory fusion . As reported recent review treatment IXT , previous study occlusion vary regard recommended occlusion dose ( 3 hour day full time ) , optimum duration occlusion treatment ( 6 week 42 month ) , eye occlude ( preferred/dominant eye alternate eye ) . For majority study , part-time occlusion , rather full-time occlusion prefer . In three occlusion study conduct prospectively , recommend dose either 3 hour day , 3 6 hour day , 4 6 hour day , duration occlusion range 3 month 6 month 42 ( mean 15 ) month . Nevertheless , previous study occlusion treatment IXT use variety outcome measure variety non-standardized time point ; therefore , definite conclusion draw exist literature . Although occlusion treatment IXT treatment widely use , randomized clinical trial evaluate effectiveness . Understanding degree effectiveness occlusion treatment IXT natural history IXT important public health implication . Successful restoration binocular alignment normal binocular function occlusion therapy , spontaneous improvement , reduce proportion child undergo surgery . Defining rate success either occlusion observation therefore important planning treatment child IXT . Alternatively , evidence low treatment effectiveness occlusion help avoid unnecessary treatment . The present study conduct assess natural history IXT establish effectiveness occlusion treatment .</detailed_description>
