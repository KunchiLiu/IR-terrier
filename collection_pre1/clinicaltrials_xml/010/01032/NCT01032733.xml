	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS A.1 . Overview Obesity associate high level inflammation oxidative stress , turn important mediator sarcopenia , decline physical functioning , physical limitation old adult . Several observational study randomize control trial ( RCTs ) suggest behavioral intervention target weight loss caloric restriction plus exercise ( CR +EX ) may reduce inflammation may improve function obese old adults.3 The mechanism CR +EX may influence physical functioning sarcopenia ( involuntary loss skeletal muscle age ) remain largely understudied . It propose CR +EX may avert sarcopenia reduce inflammation , oxidative damage , consequent apoptosis skeletal muscle myocytes . A.2 . Objective Pilot Study The propose pilot study lay groundwork RCT effect CR +EX inflammation , oxidative stress , apoptosis , body composition , intramuscular fat , sarcopenia , muscle strength , physical function obese old adult . The specific objective propose study follow : 1 . Demonstrate feasibility , acceptability , efficacy propose intervention , include : 1 . Ability recruit 40 sedentary , old obese adult mild moderate functional disability ; 2 . High rate attendance treatment session ( Mean &gt; 75 % ) ; 3 . Good response treatment ( Mean body weight loss &gt; 7 % ) . 2 . Evaluate biological effect CR +EX intervention , include change : 1 . Inflammation ( i.e. , tumor necrosis factor-α [ TNF- α ] , interleukin-6 [ IL-6 ] , myeloperoxidase [ MPO ] ) ; 2 . Oxidative stress ( RNA DNA oxidative damage leucocyte ) 3 . Apoptosis ( assessed caspase nuclear DNA fragmentation ) ; 4 . Body composition ( assessed dual x-ray absorptiometry [ DXA ) ] 5 . Sarcopenia muscle composition ( i.e. , fat free muscle intramuscular fat , assess Magnetic Resonance Imaging [ MRI ] Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy [ MRS ] ) . 3 . Examine functional change associate weight loss include : 1 . Upper low extremity muscle strength ( measure grip strength isometric isokinetic ankle knee strength ) ; 2 . Response Short Physical Performance Battery ; 3 . Self-reported disability . 4 . Test whether expect beneficial effect CR +EX intervention physical functioning mediate change inflammation , oxidative stress , apoptosis , sarcopenia ; 5 . Determine effect size CR +EX intervention key outcome provide basis sample size calculation plan large RCT . A.3 . Research Hypotheses Future RCT The synergistic effect CR +EX may effective reverse effect inflammation , oxidative distress , apoptosis , sarcopenia muscle strength physical functioning old adult . Thus , primary goal pilot study provide support future RCT test hypothesis lifestyle intervention target 7 % loss body weight CR + EX produce great reduction outcome , compare ( weight loss ) control condition . The future RCT would design test follow primary secondary hypothesis : Primary hypothesis . As compare control condition , CR +EX Intervention : 1 . Decrease inflammation ( measure TNF-α , IL-6 , MPO ) ; 2 . Decrease oxidative stress ( measure DNA RNA damage isolate leucocyte ) ; 3 . Decrease rate apoptosis ( measure caspase DNA ladder ) ; 4 . Produce favorable change body composition ( i.e. , decrease total fat mass increase appendicular lean mass , assess DXA ) ; 5 . Produce favorable change muscle composition ( i.e. , decrease intramuscular fat increase fat-free muscle assess MRI/MRS ) . 6 . Increase muscle strength performance ( assess validate strength measure )</detailed_description>

Weight &gt; 300 lb . Weight loss &gt; 10 lb . within past 6 month History surgery weight loss Hospitalization past 6 month Significant underlying disease likely limit lifespan and/or increase risk intervention ( cancer condition life expectancy &lt; 5 year exception nonmelanoma skin cancer ; serious infectious disease ; myocardium infarction , cerebrovascular accident , unstable angina within past 6 month ; NYHA Class 3 4 congestive heart failure ; aortic stenosis ; chronic hepatitis ; cirrhosis ; kidney disease ; solid organ transplantation ; chronic gastrointestinal disorder ; fibromyalgia ; chronic fatigue syndrome ; major psychiatric disorder ) . Metabolic exclusion ( rest blood pressure &gt; 160/90 mmHg , fast blood glucose &gt; 160 mg/dl , fast triglyceride &gt; 400 mg/dl ; patient medication hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia exclude unless value suggest `` poor control '' ) . Medication exclusion ( Antipsychotic agent ; monoamine oxidase inhibitor ; systemic corticosteroid ; antibiotic HIV TB ; chemotherapeutic drug ; current use prescription weightloss drug ) . Physical limitation likely prevent exercise participation ( use walker ; breathe problem limit physical activity ) . Conditions behavior likely affect conduct trial ( e.g. , unwilling unable give inform consent ; unwilling accept random assignment ; likely move area within next 2 year ; unable attend weekly meeting ; unwilling complete paperwork ; participation another randomize research project ; unwilling unable comply study requirement schedule ) Contraindications MRI ( MRincompatible implant severe claustrophobia ) . Contraindications muscle biopsy ( i.e. , lidocaine allergy ) Presence medical condition , opinion research staff , would incompatible participation weight loss plus exercise program .</criteria>
