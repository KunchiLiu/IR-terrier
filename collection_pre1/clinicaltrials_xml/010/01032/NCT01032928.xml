	<brief_summary>Cancers head neck require surgical , radiation , chemotherapy treatment intend cure disease . These treatment toxic effect muscle structure necessary swallow safely efficiently . The result swallowing problem ( dysphagia ) often remain chronic Veterans interfere ability eat drink . The cost burden VA health system high . There urgent need develop rehabilitative treatment lessen burden . The propose research design test novel swallow therapy include coordination breathe swallow . Our study train medically surgically treat , chronically dysphagic Veterans history oropharyngeal cancer novel therapy involve swallow respiratory system . If therapy find effective , long term goal project extend study multi-site , clinical trial test longstanding effect treatment compare swallow therapy swallow function , QOL cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Swallowing impairment ( dysphagia ) represent high functional morbidity veteran patient treat oropharyngeal cancer either surgical approach follow radiation recent organ-preservation protocol . The nature impairment often resistive treatment result life-long health consequence high cost burden VA health system . Recent preliminary data link alteration otherwise highly stable respiratory-swallowing phase pattern relationship swallow impairment penetration/aspiration patient group . The immediate goal clinical trial test effect novel respiratory-swallow intervention swallow impairment penetration/aspiration cohort chronically dysphagic veteran follow treatment oropharyngeal cancer . Patients present `` non-optimal '' respiratory-swallow phase pattern liquid swallow measurable swallow impairment learn `` optimal '' physiologic pattern facilitate airway protective mechanical advantage swallow . The broad goal research develop ideal respiratory-swallowing phase training method regimens alone combine traditional swallowing treatment improve swallow function acute phase recovery improve long term patient outcome . Our intention use preliminary data motivate large clinical trial compare effect respiratory-swallow phase training evidence base method swallow treatment expand approach patient group indication respiratory-swallow phase impairment ( e.g . pulmonary disease stroke ) contributing impaired swallowing function</detailed_description>
