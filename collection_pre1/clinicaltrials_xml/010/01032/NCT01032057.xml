	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy use 3-dimensional image tumor help focus thin beam radiation directly tumor , give radiation therapy high dos shorter period time , may kill tumor cell few side effect . It yet know regimen chemotherapy give together radiation therapy effective treating pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial compare side effect two regimen gemcitabine capecitabine give together radiation therapy see well work treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate activity , safety , feasibility induction chemotherapy comprise gemcitabine capecitabine follow two different schedule chemoradiotherapy comprise gemcitabine capecitabine radiotherapy patient locally advance , nonmetastatic , unresectable pancreatic cancer . - To determine two experimental arm give high generic disease-specific aspect health-related quality life ( HRQL ) follow treatment . - To determine HRQL varies treatment follow arm . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . All patient receive first induction therapy comprise gemcitabine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Following first induction therapy , patient WHO performance status 0-1 respond stable disease encompass within radically treatable radiotherapy volume randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : - Second induction therapy ( week 13-16 ) : Patients receive gemcitabine IV daily day 1 , 8 , 15 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-21 . - Chemoradiotherapy ( week 17-22 ) : Patients receive gemcitabine IV weekly day 1 undergo conformal radiotherapy 5 day week 5.5 week . - Arm II : - Second induction therapy ( week 13-16 ) : Patients receive gemcitabine IV daily day 1 , 8 , 15 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-21 . - Chemoradiotherapy ( week 17-22 ) : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-5 undergo conformal radiotherapy 5 day week 5.5 week . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire QLQ-C30 PAN26 baseline 17 , 23 , 26 , 39 , 52 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
