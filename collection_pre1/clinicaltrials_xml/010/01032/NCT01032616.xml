	<brief_summary>Splanchnic uptake metabolism contribute significantly difference flux see intravenous intragastric ingestion certain indispensable amino acid . This third series study design increase investigator knowledge metabolism two indispensable amino acid , threonine lysine , splanchnic bed . In initial two study investigator establish neonatal parenteral requirement threonine lysine . In current study , investigator examine difference uptake metabolism threonine lysine across splanchnic bed .</brief_summary>
