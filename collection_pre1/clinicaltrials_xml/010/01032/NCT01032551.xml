	<brief_summary>Coronary angiogram ( CA ) procedure , without angioplasty , perform via vascular access wrist ( radial artery ) leg ( femoral artery ) . Both radial femoral artery vascular access advantage disadvantage , neither yet prove superior health outcome . Often patient eligible access site well inform regard potential advantage disadvantage site . Vascular access cardiac catheterization consider `` grey zone '' , benefit harm may different level significance depend individual 's preference value . For example , patient significant back pain may prefer femoral approach require patient lie flay extend period time compare radial approach . For `` grey zone '' health care option , Patient Decision Aids ( PtDA ) demonstrate improve quality decision make significantly improve knowledge patient 's health care option , improve patient 's accurate risk perception , improve value congruence choose option . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) evaluate decision quality impact vascular access PtDA compare `` usual care '' eligible patient 's undergoing elective CA procedure . If PtDA demonstrate positively impact decision quality patient prior CA procedure , would invaluable bedside tool promote patient inform medical decision making . Hypothesis : The investigator believe PtDA , compare usual care , positively impact decision quality process decision making , relate vascular access option eligible patient undergo elective CA procedure .</brief_summary>
