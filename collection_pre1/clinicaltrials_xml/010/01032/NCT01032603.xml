	<brief_title>Bilateral Lateral Rectus Recession Versus Unilateral Recess-Resect Intermittent Exotropia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent exotropia ( IXT ) common form childhood onset exotropia incidence 32.1 per 100,000 child 19 year age . Intermittent exotropia characterize exotropia constant mainly present view distance , may also present near . Normal binocular single vision ( BSV ) typically present near exotropia control , evidence normal ( occasionally sub-normal ) stereoacuity . Although natural history condition largely unknown , many child IXT treat use either surgical non-surgical intervention . The rationale intervention childhood IXT extend period misalignment may lead entrenched suppression , result loss BSV . Intervention may also aim address social effect cause appearance misalign eye . Many child treat IXT currently treat surgically . There poor agreement type surgery effective correction IXT debate long related differentiation IXT sub-types . Based distance-near angle disparity , IXT sub-types classify : 1 ) basic ( similar magnitude misalignment distance near ) ; 2 ) true divergence excess ( large distance ) ; 3 ) pseudo divergence excess ( initially large distance , near angle increase follow occlusion addition plus lens near ) ; 4 ) convergence insufficiency ( large near ) . Basic pseudo divergence excess appear common sub-types , also type disagreement regard optimum surgical approach . The two common procedure bilateral lateral rectus recession ( BLRrec ) unilateral lateral rectus recession combine medial rectus resection eye ( R &amp; R ) . Traditionally , BLRrec advocate large distance angle , R &amp; R similar angle distance near . A survey American strabismus surgeon publish 1990 found majority perform BLRrec basic divergence excess type . Similarly , find poll investigator group majority still perform BLRrec basic type IXT . Nevertheless , controversy still exist surgical approach superior . Advocates BLRrec procedure tend hold surgery base purely distance angle deviation . Proponents R &amp; R surgery suggest resection medial rectus best address exodeviation near . The propose advantage R &amp; R procedure resect medial rectus , possible long term initial overcorrection , necessary stable superior long-term outcome . Nevertheless , favor BLRrec procedure suggest profound prolonged initial overcorrection occur R &amp; R unnecessary , may fact harmful . A persistent overcorrection may associate development diplopia , amblyopia , loss stereoacuity . On hand , critic BLRrec procedure suggest long-term recurrence rate higher . Poor motor outcome likely require reoperation therefore long-term success rate surgeries public health importance term cost society . Evaluating initial long-term surgical outcome propose RCT answer question regard failure rate surgery also provide need data potential harm procedure . Only one prospective randomize clinical trial address success rate BLRrec versus R &amp; R IXT . After 12-15 month follow , 82 % 17 patient undergoing R &amp; R satisfactory outcome compare 52 % 19 patient undergoing BLRrec . Nevertheless , important limitation previous study . The sample size small . The study population sub-group patient basic type IXT , exclude patient basic IXT whose angle deviation increase far distance follow occlusion , thus limit generalizability result . In addition , outcome assess unmasked , potentially bias result . One observational study 103 patient ( 90 % basic type IXT ) find 1-year success rate 56 % BLRrec 60 % R &amp; R . A retrospective study 115 patient basic type IXT report success rate 69 % BLRrec 77 % R &amp; R average 15 month follow . Other study compare surgery type limit retrospective study design also inclusion type exotropia , make difficult interpret result . In addition , many different criterion success use , preclude meaningful comparison success rate study . This lack evidence make difficult counsel parent child IXT regard likely success complication rate either procedure , limit ability make inform management decision . Establishing respective failure rate propose study allow physician offer patient type surgery high chance long-term success , minimize suboptimal result repeat surgery . The present study conduct compare effectiveness BLRrec R &amp; R surgical treatment basic type pseudo divergence excess type IXT .</detailed_description>
