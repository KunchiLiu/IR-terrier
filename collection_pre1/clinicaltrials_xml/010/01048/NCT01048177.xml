	<brief_title>A Trial Intravesical Therapy Interstitial Cystitis Patients With Generalized Vulvodynia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A TRIAL OF INTRAVESICAL THERAPY FOR INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS IN PATIENTS WITH GENERALIZED VULVODYNIA BACKGROUND : Interstitial Cystitis ( IC ) urologic pain syndrome . The classic symptom IC frequency , urgency pain ( dysuria ) absence infection obvious source . IC also describe visceral pain syndrome . In recent year , less common presentation IC report woman primary symptom gynecologic pain endometriosis , dysparunia vulvodynia1 . This aim study characterize relationship vulvodynia IC see brief course initial therapy IC relieve symptom generalize vulvodynia ( GV ) The diagnostic criterion IC , agree mid 1980 's NIDDK conference , develop research purpose . These criterion require cystoscopy hydrodistention operate room general anesthesia . There also multiple exclusionary criterion diagnosis limit utility . The end result 60 % case IC miss use NIDDK criterion diagnosis IC2 . Because limitation , cystoscopy use less often diagnosis . In recent year , potassium sensitivity test ( PST ) `` anesthetic challenge '' develop alternative test diagnosis IC . These new diagnostic technique less invasive less painful cystoscopy hydrodistention , fairly well accepted diagnosis . My colleague &amp; I first report group patient vulvodynia note IC diagnose PST1,3 . This initial data collection part study large group patient pelvic pain screen urinary symptom test IC use PST . Last month , report solely series patient present GV test IC use PST3 . In recent report , 102 / 122 ( 84 % ) patient GV find positive PST . These data suggest many patient vulvodynia may pain bladder origin . In 2008 , Welk Teichman report group patient IC treat alkinalized heparin-lidocaine solution instill bladder ( intravesical treatment ) treatment dysparunia 4 . They find 15/23 ( 65 % ) patient report improvement great 50 % Patient Objective Rating Improvement Symptom scale . This report demonstrate brief course treatment IC result significant symptom relief . Intravesical treatment IC use heparin-lidocaine-bicarbonate solution become common first line treatment many patient diagnose IC . Its use report part algorithm care patient newly diagnose IC5 . It commonly use conjunction multi-modal treatment IC , Welk &amp; Teichman 's paper demonstrate , use alone impressive initial result . There report head-to-head comparison different instillation therapy . Most instillation therapy contain heparin . Heparin constituent normal glycaso-aminoglycan ( GAG ) mucosal barrier bladder . In patient IC , mucosal barrier think defective , specifically regard presence heparin . The heparin think `` rebuild '' mucosal barrier bladder . Many bladder instillation therapy also contain anesthetic lidocaine . The anesthetic thought directly treat nerve around bladder desensitization . Sodium bicarbonate act alkinalize solution also theorize help absorption direct treatment . Lastly , find patient initial burn sensation several minute concentrate three ingredient formula small amount sterile water help prevent . Therefore add sterile water bladder instillation . We believe , many case , patient vulvodynia pain refer bladder . The next logical step define relationship vulovodynia IC offer short course intravesical treatment IC patient GV diagnosis observe symptom relief . We plan perform potassium sensitivity test diagnosis believe enough publish data yet support use anesthetic challenge study purpose . We also believe PST help patient vulvodynia understand good connection bladder vulva . Further , confident PST cause much discomfort describe report . We plan proceed report finding describe application . If pilot study demonstrate significant symptom relief population , placebo-control randomized trial treatment would indicate . Further , hypothesis hold true , several treatment modality currently use IC could explore use patient GV . We believe could literally open new door therapy patient GV . OBJECTIVE : We plan report incidence IC pilot group patient GV detect PST . We also plan report degree symptom relief obtain patient positive PST six week course initial intravesical therapy IC use several validated measurement tool . METHODS : Patients , Study sit IRB We plan enroll 30-60 patient study . We hope complete study multi-site study patient enrol two institution . We plan obtain IRB approval institution . The enrollment period approximately one year January thru December 2010 . Definition Generalized Vulvodynia For purpose report , plan use definition vulvodynia agree upon 2003 meeting ISSVD : GV pain syndrome characterize vulvar pain least 3-6 month duration discomfort occur absence relevant infectious , inflammatory , neoplastic finding absence specific clinically identifiable disorder kind ( i.e. , idiopathic ) . Patients pain generally characterize burning pain unprovoked , provoke involve vulva ( localize ) offer enrollment . The pain constant intermittent . Though intermittent symptom part 2003 ISSVD criterion , plan enroll patient intermittent symptom believe intermittent symptom may represent `` flare '' IC . Further , patient intermittent symptom may vulvodynia previously go unrecognized . Inclusion criterion We plan enroll woman 18 year old GV negative test urine infection , negative culture Chlamydia gonorrhea indicate , negative screen culture yeast infection bacterial vaginosis indicate . Patient symptom need include minimal vaginal discharge patient minimum Visual Analog Score vulvar pain least 3/10 . Exclusion criterion We exclude patient enrollment use chronic narcotic pain medication localize vulvodynia . ( We believe localize vulvodynia less likely bladder origin . ) Symptom Evaluation Patients ' surgical medical history review document . A questionnaire specifically regard symptom diagnosis pain syndrome include irritable bowel syndrome , fibromyalgia , endometriosis , chronic headache , migraine , hyper-allergic autoimmune disorder complete . Several standardized questionnaire also administer include : 1 ) Pain-Urgency-Frequency `` PUF '' questionnaire , 2 ) O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index , 3 ) Short - Urinary Quality life survey , 4 ) Visual analog pain scale , 5 ) two day bladder diary . A patient consider positive urinary symptom void nine time 24 hour either urgency pain associate void process . Following 3rd , 6th , 9th treatment , well 3-4 week follow last treatment , questionnaires re-administered . We plan collect data point multiple time treatment believe symptom relief may occur quickly . This useful know plan subsequent study . Potassium Testing The PST perform patient blind identity two solution previously reported.10-12 . All patient control receive information advance test procedure : two separate , unidentified solution instill bladder ask grade reaction . In brief , 40 ml water instill patient 's bladder 5 minute reaction urgency pain grade scale 0-5 ( Figure 1A ) . Then water remove 40 ml potassium solution ( 40 mEq KCl 100 mL water ) instill reaction similarly grade . After solution instill remove , patient ask whether one solution cause urgency pain . Any difference solution grade mild , moderate , severe . We consider PST positive follow criterion meet : patient 's urgency pain grade Solution 2 least two point zero , patient identify Solution 2 solution causing symptom . We report result term percentage patient positive test . If neither solution associate symptom urgency pain , PST consider negative . If patient report urgency pain associated solution , test potentially indeterminate . Many patient IC volume sensitive solute sensitive , react solution , suggest pain bladder origin . We rate result indeterminate unless Solution 2 ( potassium ) provocative symptom ; rate test positive . The number patient indeterminate test report . Bladder instillation : Patients positive PST eligible continue treatment phase study . Nine bladder instillation perform approximately six week patient . The solution use bladder instillation contain : heparin 40,000 unit , lidocaine 4 % - 5 ml ( 200 mg total dose ) , sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % - 3 ml sterile water - 5 ml . This current standard bladder instillation therapy . For patient positive PST , first bladder instillation perform immediately follow PST . Study cost : We include diagnosis treatment IC patient vulvodynia standard part care patient past 5-7 year . Therefore , plan continue routine care bill patient ' insurance evaluation management service well bladder instillation PST . Our potential study site ( ) proceed similarly . We seek support National Vulvodynia Association solely direct cost research coordinator coverage fellow stipend support work study . These direct cost : Research Coordinator -10 hrs /week 50 week @ 37.60 per hour include benefit = $ 18,800.00 plus fellow stipend support - 5 hour / week 50 week @ 32.45 per hour include benefit = $ 8,112.50 . Our total request fund $ 26,912.50 . Normally , fund acquire research purpose institution subject overhead `` tax '' 25-30 % . Our Director Clinical Research Development confirm NVA fund receive applied direct research cost institutional cost . Confirmation available write separate cover . Future application : If pilot study demonstrate significant symptom relief patient GV , placebo-control randomized trial treatment would indicate .
