	<brief_summary>The goal research continue develop model infection Campylobacter jejuni , bacterium cause food water-borne disease ( mainly diarrhea ) . The objective 1 ) determine healthy subject develop short-term ( &lt; 6 month ) protection reinfection C. jejuni ; 2 ) characterize immune response C. jejuni infection . Information obtain use development vaccine Campylobacter infection . Volunteers screen eligibility within 60 day prior enrollment . Screening include obtain informed consent prior study procedure . This follow medical history , physical examination , review current medication , blood sample safety lab ( WBC , Hct , Hgb , platelet count ; chemistry panel ; screen HIV , HLA-B27 , HBV , HCV ) ; urine pregnancy test female . Stool test infection . Eligible volunteer enrol study admit GCRC Day -1 . They drink measure dose C. jejuni Day 0 , follow approximately 9 inpatient day , time investigator expect least 75 % develop diarrheal illness , promptly treat replacement fluid ( oral IV , indicate ) antibiotic . During inpatient period , subject assess adverse event , blood stool specimen analyze marker infection marker immune response . Subjects must resolve resolve symptom two negative stool culture ≥12 hour apart eligible discharge , see outpatient follow-up 21 , 28 , 35 , 60 , 90 day additional AE assessment blood stool analysis . Eight subject return redo approximately 98 day initial dose , inpatient outpatient follow-up . Few none develop diarrheal illness . Four naïve ( previously unexposed ) subject also receive dose Day 98 confirm 75 % illness rate dose . They follow initial group . All participant assess phone 6 month final dose receive .</brief_summary>
