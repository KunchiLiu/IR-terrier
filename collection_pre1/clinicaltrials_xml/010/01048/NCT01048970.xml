	<brief_summary>Background : A frequent manifestation advance lung cancer malnutrition , timely identification treatment lead improve patient quality life , response rate chemotherapy survival . N-3 fatty acid , especially eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , may possess anticachectic property . This trial compare protein energy dense supplement enrich n-3 fatty acid nutritional assessment effect weight , lean body mass ( LBM ) , body fat , phase angle , dietary intake , inflammatory response quality life first-line chemotherapy patient advance lung cancer . Methods : Chemonaive patient stage IIIB IV lung cancer go receive Paclitaxel Cisplatin . Patients randomized receive two cans/day EPA DHA contain oral supplement nutritional assessment one week prior treatment complete two cycle . Serum level Reactive C Protein ( RCP ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) go measure baseline two course chemotherapy . Phase angle body composition measure use Bioimpedance analysis ( BIA ) . Quality life , dietary intake assess validate questionnaire . All data go collected database blind analysis . Written inform consent collect patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : A frequent manifestation advance lung cancer malnutrition , timely identification treatment lead improve patient quality life , response rate chemotherapy survival . N-3 fatty acid , especially eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , may possess anticachectic property . This trial compare protein energy dense supplement enrich n-3 fatty acid nutritional assessment effect weight , lean body mass ( LBM ) , body fat , phase angle , dietary intake , inflammatory response quality life first-line chemotherapy patient advance lung cancer . Hypothesis : Lung cancer patient receive EPA DHA contain oral supplement low frequency weight loss , rate adverse effect chemotherapy inflammatory response , improve quality life , response rate chemotherapy compare patient receive nutritional assessment . Methods : Chemonaive patient stage IIIB IV lung cancer go receive Paclitaxel Cisplatin . Patients randomized receive two cans/day EPA DHA contain oral supplement nutritional assessment one week prior treatment complete two cycle .
