	<brief_summary>Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) significant problem Pediatric Intensive Care Units , affect 16 every 1000 child admit unit . These disorder carry high mortality rate well numerous long-term effect survive child . As effect diseases significant social economic ramification affect child family , research development ALI/ARDS could significantly change physician understand disease treat patient . There wide range problem make certain PICU patient likely develop either ALI ARDS . This research aim determine child great risk ALI/ARDS examine difference plasma biomarkers DNA large number PICU patient . We hypothesize significant difference level specific plasma biomarkers frequency specific DNA variant exist child develop ALI/ARDS .</brief_summary>
