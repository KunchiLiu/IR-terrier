	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Seneca Valley virus-001 may able kill certain kind tumor cell without damage normal cell . Adding low dose cyclophosphamide ( part B study ) may help kill even tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose Seneca Valley virus-001 treat young patient relapse refractory neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , rare tumor neuroendocrine feature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seneca Valley Virus-001 Cyclophosphamide Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Refractory Neuroblastoma , Rhabdomyosarcoma , Rare Tumors With Neuroendocrine Features</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate maximum-tolerated dose and/or recommend phase II dose Seneca Valley virus-001 ( NTX-010 ) administer single infusion pediatric patient relapse refractory neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , rare tumor neuroendocrine feature ( Wilms tumor , retinoblastoma , adrenocortical carcinoma , carcinoid tumor ) . ( Part A [ complete ] ) - To confirm viral replication patient follow NTX-010 administration . ( Part A [ complete ] ) - To define describe toxicity NTX-010 administer schedule . ( Part A [ complete ] ) - To determine whether number regulatory T cell ( measure flow cytometry ) effectively reduce follow administration NTX-010 plus low-dose metronomic intravenous cyclophosphamide . ( Part B ) - To characterize pharmacokinetics ( time course viral clearance ) follow NTX-010 administration patient . Secondary - To preliminarily define antitumor activity NTX-010 within confines phase I study . ( Part A [ complete ] ) - To evaluate development neutralize antibody NTX-010 follow IV administration NTX-010 . ( Part A [ complete ] ) - To evaluate development neutralize antibody NTX-010 follow combination NTX-010 cyclophosphamide . ( Part B ) - To investigate presence permissivity occult circulate tumor cell prior initial intravenous administration NTX-010 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Part A ( complete ) : Patients receive Seneca Valley virus-001 ( NTX-010 ) IV 1 hour day 1 . Part B : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV orally ( PO ) day 1-14 NTX-010 IV 1 hour day 8 . In absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , patient receive cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) day 22-35 , plus cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour NTX-010 IV 1 hour day 29 . Tumor tissue sample collect baseline biomarker study . Blood stool sample collect periodically neutralize antibody viral clearance study . Additional blood sample may also collect presence permissivity occult tumor cell . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year .</detailed_description>
