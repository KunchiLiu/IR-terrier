	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn study drug RAD001 stop slow growth resectable soft tissue sarcoma . The patient 's physical state , symptom , change size tumor , laboratory finding obtain on-study help research team decide RAD001 safe effective patient condition . The study drug , RAD001 , make Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study RAD001 Soft Tissue Extremity and/or Retroperitoneal Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-arm , open label , proof principle phase II study explore efficacy RAD001 resectable soft tissue sarcoma either extremity , trunk retroperitoneum . Patients resectable sarcoma detail core biopsy molecular marker prior therapy RAD001 10mg PO daily x 2 week . Within 7-14 day end therapy RAD001 , patient bring surgery definitive resection , candidate neoadjuvant radiation , would 6 16 gauge core biopsy take percutaneously use image guidance . Pharmacodynamic marker detail objective assessed laboratory . Patients number sequentially 1 40 , patient drop due drug toxicity , goal achieve 40 patient accrual evaluation pre- post-treatment tumor sample Pharmacodynamic assay .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have resectable primary recurrent sarcoma accord diagnostic imaging criterion ( compute tomography [ CT ] and/or magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) previously irradiate . Primary/recurrent persistent sarcoma must amenable core biopsy pre RAD001 pharmacodynamic study World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status ≤ 2 Adequate bone marrow function show : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L , hemoglobin ( Hb ) &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartic transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5x ULN International Normal Ratio ( INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤1.5 . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose LMW heparin &gt; 2 week time randomization . ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Signed informed consent Patients resectable soft tissue extremity retroperitoneal sarcoma amenable pretreatment core biopsy Biopsy proven surgically resectable retroperitoneal sarcoma histologic grade Currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug . Note : Primary/recurrent/ persistent sarcoma must previously treat radiation . Primary/recurrent persistent sarcoma must treat within 4 week start RAD001 chemotherapeutic agent Have major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Receiving chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Should receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within 1 week study entry study period Brain leptomeningeal metastases Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV ; unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease ; severely impaired lung function define spirometry diffuse lung capacity oxygenation ( DLCO ) 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air ; uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN ; active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection ; liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 Patients active , bleed diathesis Females pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . If barrier contraceptive use , must continue throughout trial sex . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration RAD001 ) Received prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Known hypersensitivity RAD001 ( everolimus ) rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients History noncompliance medical regimen Unwilling unable comply protocol Cutaneous sarcoma sarcoma neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiation may indicate treatment plan Sarcomas must deem fully resectable pretreatment image No evidence distant disease</criteria>
