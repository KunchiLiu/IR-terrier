	<brief_summary>Urgency incontinence common burdensome problem woman . Current treatment condition , effective , associate potentially disabling side effect high rate discontinuation . There urgent need alternate treatment urgency incontinence clinically effective well-tolerated woman community . RESPeRATE commercially available `` walkman-like '' device measure chest/abdominal excursion respiration use elastic belt sensor place around torso clothing . The device sense respiration use musical tone key inhalation exhalation help user slow respiration prolong exhalation recommend goal le 10 breath per minute . RESPeRATE approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment mild hypertension , use device also show decrease self-reported anxiety stress , oxygen consumption , respiratory rate . Because anxiety stress strongly associate urgency incontinence , common behavioral strategy manage incontinence emphasize relaxation slow breathing time urgency episode , pace respiration may also useful treat urgency incontinence and/or decrease burden quality life . We propose conduct 6-week pilot randomize control trial slow pace respiration use RESPeRATE device among 30 woman urgency incontinence ass feasibility recruit teach woman use RESPeRATE device well gather preliminary data efficacy slow pace respiration treatment urgency incontinence relate symptom . Participants complete 7-day void diary complete questionnaire measure outcome .</brief_summary>
