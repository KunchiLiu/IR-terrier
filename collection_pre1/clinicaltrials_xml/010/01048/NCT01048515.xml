	<brief_title>The Effect Caffeine Elderly Citizen Following Eight Hour Abstinence From Caffeine Containing Drinks &amp; Foods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well document caffeine ingestion increase endurance young people exercise 60 % -85 % maximal oxygen uptake ( 13 ; 15 ; 47 ) . It also seem improve endurance measure repeat sub-maximal isometric contraction ( 42 ) , decrease rate perceive exertion exercise ( 6 ; 9 ; 46 ) . Typically , dose approximately 6 mg/kg caffeine use study . With grow number elderly physical active lifestyle many elderly participate rehabilitation program endurance enhance effect caffeine increase interest age group . We therefore conduct study healthy 75 year old citizen investigate whether 6 mg/kg caffeine improved physical performance reduce perceived effort work healthy citizen age â‰¥ 70 year . The main hypothesis caffeine would improve cycle endurance 65 % expect maximal heart rate . The study show compare placebo caffeine increase endurance 25 % ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) isometric sub-maximal strength 54 % ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) , reduce perceive exertion 5 minute bike 11 % ( p=0.002 ) , 21 30 participant reduced postural stability ( eyes open ) . In described study participant abstain caffeine contain drink food 48 hour prior test . Half participant report withdrawal symptom . Such long caffeine abstinence period would infer daily life many people . We therefore invite participant study repetition study test whether similar result would obtain participant abstained caffeine contain drink food 8 hour prior test .</detailed_description>
