	<brief_summary>Aging associate decline aerobic capacity , exercise tolerance , functional endurance lead physical disability loss independence . Furthermore , exist high prevalence obesity elderly greatly exacerbate aging-related decline function . To date , regular exercise know therapy consistently improve aerobic function , perhaps delay onset disability . Although aerobic exercise training benefit aerobic capacity endurance even obese person , data show maximal efficacy exercise improve aerobic function blunt obesity . In addition , preliminary data show potential dose-response benefit concomitant fat loss exercise-induced improvement aerobic function . Thus , combine exercise intervention caloric restriction result fat loss may efficacious improve aerobic function exercise alone obese elderly , population high risk disability . The purpose study determine whether amount fat loss ( achieve control underfeeding ) affect magnitude improvement aerobic function ( maximal aerobic capacity endurance ) response standardize exercise training stimulus follow current recommendation older person .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Overview : Phase 1 involve recruitment screen follow baseline research testing ( Phase 2 ) . Next , subject randomly assign one three 5-month treatment ( Phase 3 ) : exercise high-caloric restriction diet , exercise low-caloric restriction diet , exercise . Subjects complete follow-up test 5 month intervention . Interventions : Dietary intervention : All participant randomly assign exercise intervention either dietary intervention ( EX Only ) , 1 2 hypocaloric control diet : 1 ) -250 kcal/day deficit low fat loss ( EX+LOW CR ) 2 ) -600 kcal/day deficit high fat loss ( EX+HIGH CR ) 20 week . All meal prepare individually participant choose hypocaloric menu design RD provide balance , healthy diet . The calorie level assign person provide him/her absolute daily caloric deficit consistent group assignment ( -600 -250 kcals/day ) . Individual calorie level prescribe provide calorie level nearest 50 kcals ( e.g. , 1100 kcal , 1150 kcal , 1200 kcal , etc. ) . They educate GCRC RDs provide menu guide food purchase preparation daily breakfast meal consistent prescribed calorie level . They ask consume food give approve breakfast menu . All participant pick food 3 times/wk intervention , ask keep log everything eat drink . Exercise intervention : The exercise take place exercise facility Geriatric Research Center campus Wake Forest University/Baptist Medical Center . Two study personnel , include least one trained technician , supervise exercise session . Emergency equipment keep site exercise session . Blood pressure heart rate ( HR ) measure exercise session subject warm-up walk 3-5 min slow pace walk intensity 65-70 % heart rate reserve ( HRR , assess VO2max test ) . The duration walk exercise progress 15-20 min 50 % HRR 1st week 30 min 65-70 % HRR end 6th week thereafter . Each walk session end 3-5 min cool-down follow 5 min large muscle flexibility exercise .</detailed_description>
