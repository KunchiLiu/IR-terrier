	<detailed_description>This study build promise result Phase I trial 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide childhood solid tumor history cis-Retinoic Acid ( cis-RA ) use child neuroblastoma . This study combine two agent randomize Phase II trial . The safety feasibility use individual dosimetry measurement maximize 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide radiation dose tumor limit renal radiation dose 23 Gy rigorously test . Fixed dose allow subject receive three cycle 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide 50 mCi/m2 . Dosimetry perform cycle ; combine dosimetry measurement utilized determine whether fourth cycle administer , , dose . The administration additional cycle conditional upon ) subject experience dose-limiting toxicity previous cycle b ) meeting criterion require study initiation prior fourth dose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Disease Criteria 1 . A pathologically confirm ( histology cytology ) malignant neoplasm determine neuroblastoma neuroendocrine tumor . The subject 's neoplastic disease must ( positively ) image OctreoScan® 111InDOTAtyr3Octreotide within 4 week prior order study drug . 2. b ) Disease amenable standard treatment ( disease present surgery and/or Sandostatin treatment ) subject fail exist first line therapy ( surgery chemotherapy/radiation therapy ) . 3. c ) Upon baseline disease assessment , subject must least 1 measurable , evaluable , site disease either never irradiate previously irradiate since demonstrate progression base COG response criterion . Children 's Oncology Group response criterion include : 1 ) Complete response ( CR ) define measureable disease ; 2 ) partial response ( PR ) &gt; 50 % decrease long X wide perpendicular diameter target lesion increase lesion new lesion ; 3 ) minor response ( MR ) &gt; 25 % &lt; 50 % decrease target lesion increase lesion new lesion ; 4 ) stable disease &lt; 25 % increase decrease target lesion new lesion ; 5 ) Progressive disease ( PD ) increase &gt; 25 % measureable lesion presence new lesion consider progressive disease ( PD ) . Response assess base intent treat subject receive least one dose 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide . 4 . Each subject must least one measurable somatostatin receptor positive lesion local irradiation via external beam , conformal stereotactic radiation treatment within 4 week prior study drug administration full craniospinal radiation within 3 month prior study drug administration . 5 . Bone marrow &gt; /= 40 % cellularity 1 million CD34+ stem cells/kg store . 6 . Life expectancy &gt; 2 month &lt; 12 month . 7 . Biopsy least one lesion bone marrow identify progressive malignancy within four week prior first dose Onalta® encourage require . If biopsy perform clinical reason , available tissue previous biopsy require . 2 . Age 6 months30 year . 3 . COG performance status /= 60 % Lansky Play Scale &gt; /= 60 % ) . 4 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3 platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x nl age weight AST ( SGOT ) &amp; ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal age creatinine &lt; 1.0 child &lt; 5 year age ; &lt; 1.2 child 510 year age ; &lt; 1.7 &gt; 10 year AND GFR &gt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 urinalysis great 1+ hematuria proteinuria 5 . Cardiac function must adequate shorten fraction &gt; 28 % echo ejection fraction &gt; 50 % biplane method echo 6 . The effect 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide develop human fetus unknown . Retinoic acid know harmful develop human fetus . For reason Class C agent know teratogenic , woman men childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 7 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 8 . Serum triglycerides &lt; 300 mg/dL . 9 . Concomitant Therapy The subject may receive approve investigational antineoplastic therapy treatment refractory somatostatinreceptor positive tumor course study , exclude somatostatin analogue bisphosphonates . However , subject somatostatin analogue therapy discontinue therapy 12 hour prior ) injection OctreoScan® 111InDOTAtyr3Octreotide , b ) infusion 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide 12 hour post administration . Subjects hormonal therapy ( somatostatin analogue ) &gt; 2 month SD PD may continue receive hormonal therapy study . Subjects initiate another tumorspecific therapy discontinue treatment 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide . Disease progression alone mandate discontinuation subject treatment . All subject receive least one dose 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide must continue LongTerm Followup Study Period point treatment discontinuation . This necessary determine longterm effect treatment 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide . Subjects may receive , discretion investigator , appropriate medical treatment medical problem arise study . Exclusion Criteria enrollment Cycle One study period : 1 . Age le 6 month great 30 year . 2 . Pregnancy breast feed . 3 . Surgery , radiation chemotherapy within 4 week study drug administration . 4 . Another investigational drug within 4 week study drug administration . 5 . More one , concurrent , malignant disease . 6 . History congestive heart failure , unless cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 40 % . 7 . Another significant medical , psychiatric , surgical condition currently uncontrolled treatment would likely affect subject 's ability complete protocol . 8 . Any subject , opinion physician , 24hour discontinuation somatostatin analogue therapy represent health risk . Also subject receive longacting somatostatin analogue past 21 day exclude . 9 . Bone marrow cellularity &lt; 40 % without &gt; /= 1 million CD34+ stem cells/kg store . 10 . External beam radiation kidney ( scatter dose &lt; 500 cGy single kidney radiation &lt; 50 % single kidney acceptable ) . 11 . Antibodies 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide Octreotide . 12 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) study drug administration recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 13 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 14 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide . 15 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 16 . Pregnant woman exclude study 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide Class C agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide , breastfeed discontinue mother treated 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide . 17 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
