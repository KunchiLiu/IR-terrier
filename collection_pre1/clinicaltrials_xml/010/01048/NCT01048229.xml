	<brief_summary>Title : Evaluation tolerance acceptability Rasagiline treatment early-stage Parkinson 's disease . Type study : Phase IV Study objective : Principal objective : To evaluate tolerance acceptability Rasagiline versus Pramipexole ( dopamine agonist ) . Secondary objective : To evaluate clinical benefit Rasagiline administer monotherapy patient present early-stage Parkinson 's disease . Study design : Multicentre comparative randomise parallel-group double-blind study , total duration fifteen week ( three week dose titration twelve week follow-up ) , comprise four evaluation ( D0 , W3 , W9 , W15 ) . Number patient : 240 patient ( i.e . 120 group ) present early stage idiopathic Parkinson 's disease . Number centre : 70 neurologist distribute throughout three French region Treatment study : Rasagiline Presentation : 1 mg tablet Dosage : 1 mg/day single dose , morning breakfast-time . Comparator : Pramipexole Presentation : 0.125 mg , 0.25 mg 1 mg pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate tablet ( correspond respectively 0.088 mg , 0.18 mg 0.7 mg pramipexole ) Dose-titration : As specify SPC pramipexole , product administer three daily dos , preferably meal , treatment begin dose-titration phase three week ' duration , time dosage gradually increase . On completion dose-titration phase , minimum therapeutic dose 1.5 mg per day must achieve patient . The patient achieve dosage withdrawn study . The reason stop dose-titration ( leave study ) detail CRF . Dosage : The effective dosage pramipexole adapt individual , depend clinical response tolerance , successive stage 0.75 mg one-week interval , without exceed maximum dose 3 mg per day . Treatment prohibit study : Pethidine , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , dextromethorphan , MAOI , sympathomimetics ( include nasal oral decongestant contain ephedrine pseudoephedrine ) , anti-H2s ( cimetidine , ranitidine ) . Principal evaluation criterion : The principal criterion evaluation percentage patient present least one `` significant `` adverse event follow-up . A significant adverse event define : - severe adverse event ( SAE ) - adverse event opinion investigator require suspension treatment reduction dosage - adverse event consider severe moderate patient ( AEs intensity evaluate consider moderate severe ) Secondary evaluation criterion : - analysis adverse event total population - analysis adverse event degree severity - analysis adverse event subject 65 - analysis adverse event symptom - percentage patient present sleep problem ( daytime drowsiness , narcolepsy , insomnia , fragment sleep… ) - evaluation Epworth Sleepiness Scale - evaluation quality life ( PDQ-8 ) - evaluation utility EuroQol ( EQ-5D ) - overall clinical impression evaluate doctor ( CGI-I ) patient ( PGI-I ) - Global-Benefit-Risk ( GBR ) - Evaluation resource Analysis principal criterion : Analysis principal criterion carry patient intention-to-treat population tolerance data available least one visit D0 . Comparative analysis The percentage patient two treat group present least one significant adverse event compare use Khi-2 test . Logistic regression A logistic regression analysis perform order explain presence/absence significant event . The nature treatment centre act explanatory variable , initial score covariates . Analyses also perform quantitative variable ( ANCOVA ) Evaluation Global Benefit-Risk ( GBR ) accord model suggest Chuang-Stein et al . Number subject require : Calculation size base hypothesis percentage patient present least one significant adverse event follow-up ( principal evaluation criterion ) differ 15 % one group . With alpha risk set 5 % beta ri kat 20 % , number subject require , calculate use Casagrande et Pike formula , 110 subject per group . The NSN slightly overestimate order maintain desire strength take account possibility lose follow-up , fixed 240 patient .</brief_summary>
