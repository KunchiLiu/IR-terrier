	<brief_summary>The purpose study well characterize difference mood , attention , brain activation pattern underlie beneficial effect pharmacological treatment previously demonstrate help individual successfully quit tobacco smoking . Smokers randomly assign one three treatment : 1 ) bupropion sustain release ( SR ) , 2 ) nicotine patch , 3 ) placebo patch plus pill across 45-day period 3-week intensive post-treatment follow-up .

	<detailed_description>The first aim revise proposal accurately assess duration trajectory smoke abstinence symptom associate biobehavioral index across 66 day quit smoke 3 different treatment group : 1 ) bupropion SR ( BUP ) , 2 ) transdermal nicotine patch ( TNP ) , 3 ) placebo patch plus placebo pill . Study sensitivity accuracy maximize use procedure design maximize abstinence minimize study dropout . The second aim characterize brain psychological mechanism BUP TNP promote abstinence . While efficacy BUP TNP promote smoke abstinence repeatedly demonstrate , little known mechanism mediate efficacy . The final primary goal competitive continuation proposal characterize individual difference psychological brain mechanism mediate beneficial effect BUP TNP smoke abstinence withdrawal symptom . A secondary goal ass ability battery innovative brain biobehavioral measure attention affect predict relapse . To achieve goal , effect quit smoking without help TNP BUP assess intensively across 66 day abstinence . Dependent measure mood , vigilance , attentional bias smoke emotional stimulus , related physiological measure ( rest EEG activation activation asymmetry index affective state trait , event-related potential activity elicit emotional smoking stimulus ) . Smokers randomly assign one three immediate-quit group ( N = 60 per group ) : ( 1 ) bupropion + placebo patch , ( 2 ) placebo pill + nicotine patch , ( 3 ) placebo patch + placebo pill ; fourth ( control ) group ( N = 40 ) quit final experimental session ( subject complete 66-day* abstinence period ) . Subjects 3 treatment group control group set biobehavioral measure assess experimental session point time . It hypothesize BUP TNP common unique mechanism reduce withdrawal symptom gender personality trait moderate effect treatment . ( Note . * To avoid final-session mood arousal effect subject actually quit 67 day , biobehavioral measure collect 66th day abstinence . )</detailed_description>
