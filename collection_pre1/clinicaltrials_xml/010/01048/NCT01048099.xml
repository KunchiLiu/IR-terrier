	<brief_title>Use PRO Onc Assay Assess HER2 Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-part trial design evaluate clinical significance PRO Onc assay use patient metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer . The first part study determine incidence HER overexpression/activation , determine PRO Onc assay , patient previously judge HER2-negative breast cancer FISH analysis . Blood specimen obtain patient HER2-negative breast cancer ; CTCs isolate tested HER2 overexpression/activation use PRO Onc Assay . When clinically indicate , fine needle aspiration biopsy also obtain submit PRO Onc Assay . If incidence HER2 overexpression/activation , determine PRO Onc Assay , &gt; 10 % , study proceed Part 2 . Part 2 study assess efficacy HER2-targeted therapy group patient HER2-negative breast cancer identify HER2 overexpression/activation PRO Onc Assay . Patients treat either trastuzumab pertuzumab . Patients progress first 8 week HER2-targeted treatment discontinue remove study . After 8 week , patient stable disease allow add chemotherapy HER2-targeted therapy . Patients objective response single-agent , HER2-targeted therapy 8 week continue single-agent therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part I 1 . Women HER2negative breast cancer , define FISH test . ( FISH test may perform primary tumor , subsequently biopsy metastatic lesion . ) 2 . Patients currently receive chemotherapy , schedule start chemotherapy ( secondline subsequent ) , HER2negative metastatic breast cancer . 3 . To begin protocol treatment , patient must progress least 1 previous chemotherapy regimen metastatic breast cancer . 4 . Patients ER/PR positive negative eligible . ER/PR positive patient refractory hormonal therapy , good candidate hormonal therapy due clinical feature . 5 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . 6 . Adequate recovery recent surgery ; ≥ 1 week must elapse time minor surgery ; ≥ 4 week must elapse time major surgery . 7 . Patients must measurable disease per RECIST criterion . 8 . Laboratory value follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/μL Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥10 g/dL Platelets ≥100,000/L AST ALT alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) must &lt; 2.5 x ULN , &lt; 5 x ULN patient liver metastasis . Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min Patients Part 1 HER2 overexpression/activation identify PRO Onc Assay may enter treatment portion Part 2 , meet Part 2 eligibility criterion . 9 . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week . 10 . Patient must accessible treatment followup . 11 . Patients must able understand investigational nature study give write informed consent prior study entry . Part II 1 . Women HER2negative breast cancer , define FISH test . ( FISH test may perform primary tumor , subsequently biopsy metastatic lesion . ) 2 . Patients currently receive chemotherapy , schedule start chemotherapy , HER2negative metastatic breast cancer . 3 . Patients ER/PR positive negative eligible . ER/PR positive patient refractory hormonal therapy , good candidate hormonal therapy due clinical feature . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . 5 . Adequate recovery recent surgery ; ≥ 1 week must elapse time minor surgery ; ≥ 4 week must elapse time major surgery . 6 . Patients must measurable disease per RECIST criterion . 7 . Laboratory value follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/μL Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥10 g/dL Platelets ≥100,000/uL AST ALT alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) must &lt; 2.5 x ULN , &lt; 5 x ULN patient liver metastasis . Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min 8 . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week . 9 . Patient must accessible treatment followup . 10 . Patients must able understand investigational nature study give write informed consent prior study entry . 11 . Patients eligible HER2targeted treatment begin treatment first time treatment change necessary ( i.e . next progression metastatic breast cancer ) . This may occur immediately PRO Onc assay result receive , may several month later , patient respond well current chemotherapy . 12 . Patients must continue meet inclusion exclusion criterion Part 2 screen population time ready start HER2targeted treatment . 13 . Ejection fraction ≥ 50 % , measure echocardiogram ( ECHO ) MUGA . Part I : 1 . Patients currently respond hormonal therapy . 2 . Previous treatment HER2targeted agent . 3 . Patients meningeal metastasis . 4 . Patients consider likely candidate subsequent therapy next progression metastatic breast cancer . 5 . Women pregnant lactating . 6 . Patients New York Heart Association class II great congestive heart failure . 7 . Any following ≤6 month prior start study treatment : myocardial infarction ; severe unstable angina ; ongoing cardiac dysrhythmia 8 . Concurrent severe , intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit safety compliance study requirement . 9 . Mental condition would prevent patient comprehension nature , risk associate , study . 10 . Use nonapproved investigational agent ≤ 30 day administration first dose study drug . Patients may receive investigational anticancer treatment participate study . Part II 1 . Patients currently respond hormonal therapy . 2 . Previous treatment HER2targeted agent . 3 . Patients meningeal metastasis . 4 . Patients active brain metastasis . Patients receive radiation surgery brain metastasis eligible evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) disease progression , least 4 week elapse since treatment . Ideally , patient still require use seizure medication steroid . 5 . Patients consider likely candidate subsequent therapy next progression metastatic breast cancer . 6 .
