	<brief_title>Conservative Surgery Women With Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage IA2 IB1 cervical cancer currently treat radical hysterectomy ( removal uterus , cervix , parametrium ) radical trachelectomy ( removal cervix parametrium ) . The parametrium tissue next uterus cervix hold organ place . Pelvic lymph node possibly para-aortic lymph node ( near aorta abdomen ) also remove . This procedure call pelvic para-aortic lymphadenectomy . While surgery effective , significant side effect occur , bladder , bowel , and/or sexual dysfunction . Conservative surgery involve removal pelvic lymph node ( pelvic lymphadenectomy ) . The cervix parametrium leave intact . During surgery , woman longer want child , simple hysterectomy ( removal uterus without removal fallopian tubes ovary ) also perform . In study , participant conservative surgery . Conservative Surgery : If find eligible take part study , conservative surgery . You take operate room put sleep use general anesthesia . You pelvic lymph node remove , however , parametrium leave intact . If longer want child , simple hysterectomy . Removal pelvic lymph node take 1-2 hour . If also decide simple hysterectomy , procedure take 2 hour . You sign separate consent surgery , discus risk detail . Study Procedures : If agree take part study , follow information collect medical record and/or ask information enroll study : - Age time cancer diagnosis - Race - Height weight determine body mass index ( BMI ) - Menopausal status - Symptoms - History sexually transmit disease - Smoking history - Child bear history The following information collect medical record and/or ask information surgery : - How long surgery take complete - What procedures perform surgery - How long hospital - If blood loss surgery - If blood transfusion perform surgery - What complication , , happen related surgery Starting 3 month first visit surgery , study visit every 3 month 2 year . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You pelvic exam . - You pap smear . You contact telephone mail every year 3 year . You ask cancer return , last saw doctor , complication problem may . If call , call take less 10 minute . Length Study : You may remain study 5 year surgery . You take study early either lymph node cervix ( simple hysterectomy perform ) remove surgery contain cancer . This investigational study . Up 195 patient take part multicenter study . Up 40 participant enrol MD Anderson Harris Health System .</detailed_description>
