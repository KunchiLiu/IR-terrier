	<brief_summary>This research do melanoma brain difficult treat respond radiation chemotherapy , temozolomide . One reason melanoma make chemical signal brain provide new blood vessel tumor . The main signal call VEGF . Bevacizumab antibody block VEGF . The investigator want see combination bevacizumab temozolomide stop melanoma grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Plus Bevacizumab Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Involving Central Nervous System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose use combination temozolomide bevacizumab carefully select group patient metastatic melanoma brain . This combination test primary brain tumor melanoma involve brain . The 6-week , 2-week low-dose schedule propose trial capitalize preclinical data demonstrate temozolomide inhibits angiogenesis low , non-toxic dos correspond plasma concentration achieve oral administration , so-called 'metronomic ' scheduling . The precise mechanism antiangiogenic action remain elucidated . This potential synergistic mechanism , together bulk evidence activity present suggest combination well-tolerated , safe possibly effective .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm malignant melanoma clinical evidence metastatic disease brain . Mucosal ocular melanoma include . 2 . Untreated asymptomatic brain metastasis ≤ 2 cm maximal diameter , mild minimal edema , without associate hemorrhage midline shift . 3 . Progressing brain metastasis size , amenable surgical resection and/or progress radiation therapy without evidence active associate hemorrhage . Treatment bevacizumab may initiate 4 week surgical resection radiation therapy completion . 4 . Hemorrhagic metastases resolve previous resection radiation therapy exclude patient new nonhemorrhagic metastasis meet criterion describe participate . 5 . Patients must measurable metastasis brain , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm brain MRI gadolinium . For disease outside brain , tumor must &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Measurable disease outside brain NOT require . 6 . Patients number previous systemic therapy eligible . Previous temozolomide treatment give different schedule allow , long give combination VEGFtargeting drug . 7 . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use bevacizumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 8 . Life expectancy 8 week great . 9 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . 10 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/µl Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µl Platelets &gt; 100,000/µl Total Bilirubin ** Within institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine* Within institutional upper limit normal* If creatinine &gt; upper limit normal , creatinine clearance &gt; /= 60 ml/m2 require Except patient know Gilbert 's syndrome 11 . The effect bevacizumab develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason antiangiogenic agent use trial may teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 12 . Concomitant use steroid treat cerebral edema allow . 13 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . DiseaseSpecific Exclusions Patients metastatic disease brain fitting inclusion criterion . Patients leptomeningeal disease exclude . General Medical Exclusions Subjects meeting follow criterion ineligible study entry : 1 . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure . 2 . Life expectancy le 8 week 3 . Current , recent ( within 4 week first infusion study ) , plan participation experimental drug study study . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition bevacizumab temozolomide . 5 . Patients must exhibit clinical evidence coagulopathy . The INR must &lt; 1.5 value PTT must within normal limit . Anticoagulation allow . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , untreated cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Pregnant woman exclude study bevacizumab agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother bevacizumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated bevacizumab . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 8 . Otherwise well HIVpositive patient permit enroll trial . BevacizumabSpecific Exclusions 1 . Previous treatment bevacizumab . 2 . Inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg antihypertensive medication ) 3 . Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy 4 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure ( see Appendix E ) 5 . History myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month prior study enrollment 6 . History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month prior study enrollment 7 . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , aortic dissection ) 8 . Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease 9 . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy 10 . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior study enrollment anticipation need major surgical procedure course study 11 . Core biopsy minor surgical procedure , exclude placement vascular access device , within 7 day prior study enrollment 12 . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior study enrollment 13 . Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture 14 . Proteinuria screen demonstrate either Urine protein : creatinine ( UPC ) ratio 1.0 screening OR Urine dipstick proteinuria ≥ 2+ ( patient discover ≥2+ proteinuria dipstick urinalysis baseline undergo 24 hour urine collection must demonstrate ≤ 1g protein 24 hour eligible ) .</criteria>
