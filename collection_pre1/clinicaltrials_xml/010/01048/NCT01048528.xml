	<detailed_description>Cancer vaccine emerge important tool cancer treatment prevention . Unfortunately , cohort ultimately benefit vaccine , elevate risk cancer , likely stress . Chronic stress impair immune function , include immune response vaccine . An inadequate response vaccine weaken protective effect . Women elevate risk breast cancer experience significant level distress associate immune function decrement . Interventions treat distress-related immune decrement among woman need woman among first candidate breast cancer vaccine . In theory , stress-management intervention improve immune function response vaccine ; however , finding date mixed . The propose investigation conduct exploratory randomize clinical trial collect preliminary data efficacy cognitive behavioral stress management ( CBSM ) group intervention among woman elevate risk breast cancer family history reporting elevate level distress . Study outcomes include antibody cellular immune response hepatitis A vaccine self-reported distress .</detailed_description>
