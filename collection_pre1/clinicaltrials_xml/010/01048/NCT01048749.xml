	<brief_summary>The purpose study test physical therapy intervention reduce pain low back leg . With individual age 40 year , pain may associate change back height age cushion back bone . When pain cause , completion different position rest period show help reduce pain , least temporarily . This study compare two position ; 1 ) float deep warm water weight attach ankle , take load spine , 2 ) lie back hip knee flex 90 degree angle . The height person measure completion intervention use specially design measure tool . Experimental hypothesis : 1 . Subjects low back leg pain suggestive nerve root compression syndrome experience increase spinal height complete aquatic vertical suspension and/or land-based supine flexion . 2 . Subjects low back leg pain suggestive nerve root compression syndrome experience great increase height , great reduction pain intensity location complete underwater vertical suspension compare supine land base flexion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interventional Study Effects Spine Height With Two Unloading Positions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal height affect throughout life many different physiological change mechanical stress , large portion think occur primarily intervertebral disc degeneration resultant reduction overall spinal height . The use specific posture rest period increase overall spinal height suggest various stadiometric research study . This overall spinal height change use treatment tool management symptom chronic low back pain sign nerve root compression . The purpose study investigate effect aquatic vertical suspension spinal height , symptom location pain intensity compare commonly use land base supine flexion position . The study conduct one outpatient physical therapy clinic subject recruit local community . A single blind True Experimental Repeated Measure cross design utilized . Spine height measure use commercially available stadiometer . Spinal height measurement complete loaded walking , supine land base flexion position aquatic vertical hang .</detailed_description>
