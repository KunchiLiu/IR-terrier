	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetic Study Oral ON 01910.Na Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This three-part phase 1 study nineteen one hundred two patient Low , Intermediate-1 , Intermediate-2 , High risk MDS receive oral dos ON 01910.Na Concentrate escalate single multiple dos ( 70mg 700 mg bid ) 14 day 21-day cycle . Part I : Bioavailability Tolerability Single Oral Dosing ( n=3 ) : In Part I trial bioavailability tolerability oral ON1910.Na administer single , oral , escalate dos fast state ( define less 30 minute next meal ) determine three patient Low , Intermediate-1 , Intermediate-2 High Risk MDS . All three patient receive first week 70mg single oral dose blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis take dose . In absence drug-related grade 2 toxicity high , single dosing escalate patient weekly 140mg ( week 2 ) , 280mg ( week 3 ) , 560mg ( week 4 ) 700mg ( week 5 ) . At end Part I ( week 6 ) , patient eligible enrolled Part II . Part II : Determination MTD ( n=10-84 ) : Part II proceed measurable drug level measure Part I absence DLT 70 mg single dose level Part I . The maximum tolerate dose oral ON1910.Na administer fast state ( define less 30 minute next meal ) twice day 14 consecutive day determine patient patient Low , Intermediate-1 , Intermediate-2 High Risk MDS follow adaptive design . If blood level detect 560mg 700mg dose level Part I , start dose 140 mg . If blood level detect 280mg dose level , start dose 70mg . Initially , patient enrol two-patient cohort . - In absence drug-related grade 2 high toxicity either one two patient treat entire 21-day first cycle ( treat complete 14 day-period follow another 7 day ) , next two patient receive dose escalate 100 % prior dose ( e.g . 140mg 70mg prior dose ; next dose level 280 , 560 700mg ) . - If drug-related grade 2 high toxicity observe least one two patient treat full 21-day cycle , cohort expand order obtain 3 evaluable ( treated entire 21-day first cycle ) patient . - If dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) observe first three patient treat entire 21-day first cycle , next three patient enrol dose level increase 50 % prior dose ( e.g . 105mg 70mg prior dose ; see Table 1 ) . - If one DLT observe first three patient treat entire 21-day first cycle , three next patient enrol dose level . - If one DLT observe six patient treated entire 21-day cycle , next six patient administer dose level increase 25 % prior dose ( e.g . 88mg 70mg prior dose ; see Table 2 ) subsequent dose escalation exceed 25 % . - If two patient cohort experience DLT , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) exceed dose escalation occur . The MTD establish immediate prior dose level - Identical rule apply cohort patient recruit study . DLT must least possibly attributable ON 01910.Na define : - Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity nausea , vomit , diarrhea , fever , esophagitis/dysphagia - Grade 3 nausea vomit uncontrolled antiemetic ; grade 3 diarrhea uncontrolled antidiarrheal agent ; grade 3 drug-induced fever uncontrolled antipyretic - Grade 3 stomatitis and/or esophagitis/dysphagia last &gt; 3 day - Delay recovery baseline blood count pre-treatment baseline ( &gt; 20 % difference ) 30 day absence response If patient DLT ( see definition ) beyond completion first 21-day cycle , administration oral ON 01910.Na , treatment discontinue reduce ( discretion Principal Investigator ) low dose level , 25 % patient treat 70mg dose level . Patients return within 20 % baseline , pre-cycle ANC , platelet hemoglobin level prior treatment subsequent cycle . Treatment delay 21 day ( 1 cycle length ) count return pre-treatment baseline . If count still adequate treatment , patient re-evaluated 2 week later . If non-hematological toxicity Grade 2 3 present day ON 01910.Na administration , drug administration withhold resolution ≤ grade 1 toxicity present . ON 01910.Na blood concentration determine 1 hour first dose day 1 , 7 14 patient recruit Part II . Treatment continue progression stop absence bone marrow response hematological improvement 16 week . Part III : Food/Fast Absolute Bioavailability PK analysis MTD confirm cohort ( n=15 ) : Up fifteen patient Low , Intermediate-1 , Intermediate-2 High Risk MDS enrol MTD dose level treat progression . The treatment stop absence bone marrow response hematological improvement 16 week . A subset twelve patient undergo follow procedure : On Day 1 , patient dose ON 01910.Na 800 mg/m2 IV 24 hour pharmacokinetic analysis perform - After wash-out period 3 day , patient dose ON 01910.Na MTD dose fast state twice day 3 day . Pharmacokinetic analysis perform first ( Day 5 ) day drug administration . Following overnight fast least 10 hour , patient administer ON 01910.Na 240 mL ( 8 fluid ounce ) water . No food allow least 4 hour post-dose . Water allow desire except one hour drug administration . Patients receive standardize meal schedule time pharmacokinetic evaluation . - After second wash-out period 3 day , patient dose ON 01910.Na MTD dose feed state ( define within 30 minute prior meal ) twice day 3 day . Pharmacokinetic analysis perform first ( Day 11 ) day drug administration . Following overnight fast least 10 hour , patient start meal 30 minute prior administration ON 01910.Na . Patients eat meal 30 minute less ON 01910.Na administer 30 minute start meal 240 mL ( 8 fluid ounce ) water . No food allow least 4 hour post-dose . Water allow desire except one hour ON 01910.Na administration . Oral dose MTD level resume fast state Day 1 second 21-day cycle ( 14 day bid dose follow 7-day treatment period ) progression note . The treatment stop absence bone marrow response hematological improvement 16 week . If patient DLT ( see definition ) beyond completion first 21-day cycle , administration oral ON 01910.Na , treatment discontinue reduce ( discretion Principal Investigator ) low dose cohort level , 25 % patient treat 70 mg dose level . Patients return within 20 % baseline , pre-cycle ANC , platelet hemoglobin level prior treatment subsequent cycle . Treatment delay 21 day ( 1 cycle length ) count return pre-treatment baseline . If count still adequate treatment , patient re-evaluated 2 week later . If non-hematological toxicity Grade 2 3 present day ON 01910.Na administration , drug administration withhold resolution ≤ grade 1 toxicity present .</detailed_description>
