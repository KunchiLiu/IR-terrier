	<brief_summary>Background : - One kind drug craving , know cue-elicited craving , occur drug user see drug-related cue ( image someone use drug ) begin feel crave drug . Researchers interested study cue-elicited craving affect brain activity use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) data . Objectives : - To determine part brain associate involved control cue-related craving smoker . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age current smoker ( 10 cigarette per day ) agree try abstain smoke 1 week experiment . Design : - Participants visit clinical center four scanning session , ask perform two three outpatient task home course study . - Scan 1 : Training session mock fMRI scanner , follow actual fMRI scan session EEG participant respond picture . - Outpatient Task 1 : Tolerance test nicotine patch ( worn 8 hour , follow 12 additional hour without cigarette use ) . - Scans 2 3 : Training session fMRI scan test either nicotine patch placebo . Tasks fMRI involve look cue , report crave suppress crave . - Outpatient Task 2 : Participants keep electronic diary 10 14 day , respond question direct researcher . - Scans 4 5 : Training session , fMRI scan EEG , test participant instruct method attempt control craving . - Outpatient Task 3 : Participants keep electronic diary 14 day . For first 7 day , participant ask attempt abstain nicotine ; participant may smoke normally second 7 day . - Participants contact 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month end study follow-up question current smoking habit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Neural Basis Cue-Elicited Cigarette Craving Its Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Drug crave motivational state associate conscious desire consume drug ( Fredrickson et al. , 1995 ; Drummond , 2001 ) . When drug abuser see drug-related cue , cue-elicited drug craving induce ( Drummond , 2001 ) . The main goal investigation ascertain neural basis cue-elicited drug ( e.g . cigarette ) crave control smoker . Study population : The experimental population investigation nicotine-dependent adult age 18-50 year old . Design : Participants see smoking-related cue neutral cue complete cognitive task ( e.g . report regulate craving , etc ) . At time , employ functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rtfMRI ) , electroencephalography ( EEG ) measure brain activity . Outcome measure : There direct benefit participant joining study . Data study expect contribute well understanding neural process cigarette crave . Thus , result may benefit health society . MRI-related risk ( e.g. , injury metal implant , claustrophobia , temporary hearing threshold alteration due loud banging noise ) nicotine-patch-related risk ( e.g. , dizziness , headache , upset stomach , vomit , diarrhea , redness swell patch site ) participant minimize careful prescreening standard protection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All participant must : 1 . Be ages 1850 . Justification : Many cognitive process change age . In addition , risk difficulttodetect medical abnormality silent cerebral infarct increase age . Therefore , old individual , define 50 , exclude . 2 . Be good health . Justification : Many illness alter fMRI signal , cognition . Assessment tool ( ) : Participants provide brief health history phone screening , undergo history physical examination qualify IRP clinician . 3 . Be righthanded . Justification : Many brain function assess protocol show evidence lateralize brain . In order reduce variance data possibility , participant must righthanded . Assessment tool ( ) : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory 4 . Be free dependence substance ( except nicotine ) . Justification : Dependence substance may result unique CNS deficit would increase noise data . Assessment tool ( ) : Substance Use Disorders module SCID confirmation clinical interview negative urine drug screen . 5 . Must smoke great equal 10 cigarette per day least two year , urine cotinine level least 100ng/ml score Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) must great equal 2 . Justification : The aim study phenomenon link nicotine dependence occur regular frequent smoking . Assessment tool ( ) : Selfreport , urine cotinine test ( smoker define cotinine level great equal 100ng/mL ) , FTND test . 6 . All participant able abstain alcohol 24 hour 1/2 cup caffeine 12 hour experiment session . Justification : Alcohol caffeine may result brain influence data . Assessment tool ( ) : Selfreport breathalyzer test . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants exclude : 1 . Are suitable undergo fMRI experiment due pregnancy , implant metallic device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part ) , body morphology claustrophobia . Justification : MR scan one primary measurement tool use protocol . Assessment tool ( ) : Prospective participant fill MRI screen questionnaire undergo interview MR technologist . Pregnancy test perform female participant childbearing age experimental session . Questions concern suitability scanning refer MR Medical Safety Officer . Prospective participant question symptom claustrophobia place mock scanner first visit ass possible difficulty tolerate confinement scanner ability fit scanner . 2 . Have coagulopathies , history , current superficial , deep vein thrombosis , musculoskeletal abnormality restrict individual ability lie flat extend period time . Justification : MR scan session require participant lie flat back remain perfectly still approximately two hour . Therefore , condition would make difficult ( e.g . chronic back pain , significant scoliosis ) dangerous ( e.g . familial hypercoagulability syndrome , history thrombosis ) exclusionary . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician , supplement trial lie mock scanner assess comfort issue . 3 . Have HIV Syphilis . Justification : HIV Syphilis CNS sequela , thus introduce unnecessary variability data . Assessment tool ( ) : HIV blood test RPR+ . 4 . Have neurological illness include , limited , seizure disorder , migraine ( &gt; 2/yr prophylaxis ) , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history significant head trauma , CVA , CNS tumor . Justification : CNS diseases alter CNS function , possibly , neuronalvascular coupling form basis BOLD fMRI signal use study . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician , urine drug screening anticonvulsant disclose history . History head trauma loss consciousness 5 minute postconcussive sequelae last two day , regardless loss consciousness , exclusionary . 5 . Have major medical illness likely interfere study result safety individual participation . Justification : Many illness cover may increase risk alter important outcome measure . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician CBC , urinalysis , NIDA chemistry panel ( liver function test , electrolyte , kidney function ) . The follow individual laboratory result independently disqualify individual . The MRP retain discretion exclude less extreme value , depend clinical presentation , make final judgment questionable lab result Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl WBC &lt; 2400/microl LFTs &gt; 3 time normal HCG positive Serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl Urine protein &gt; 2 plus Serum cholesterol level &gt; 250 mg/dl . 6 . Have current major psychiatric disorder include , limited , mood , anxiety , psychotic disorder , substanceinduced psychiatric disorder . Justification : Psychiatric disorder involve central neural system ( CNS ) , therefore , expect alter fMRI measure use study . Assessment tool ( ) : Computerized SCIDNP , ASRS ( adult ADHD selfreport scale ) DSMIV ( DSMIV , APA , 1994 ) confirm clinician interview . 7 . Regularly use prescription , overthecounter herbal medication may alter CNS function , cardiovascular function neuronalvascular coupling . Justification : Compounds alter BOLD signal alter primary measure use study . Assessment tool ( ) : History comprehensive urine drug screen detect antidepressant , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , anticonvulsant , barbiturate common medication drug abuse . 8 . Are cognitively impair learn disabled . Justification : Cognitive impairment learn disability associate alteration brain region use accomplish task , , therefore , may introduce significant variably data . In addition , cognitive impairment may affect ability give inform consent . Assessment tool ( ) : History know learning disability cognitive impairment . Vocabulary subtest WASI give . IQ estimate must 85 ( correspond vocabulary subtest score &gt; 48 ) . In case suspect nonverbal learning disability mild verbal deficit , full WASI may give obtain robust estimate IQ . 9 . Significant cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . Justification : Such condition alter distort BOLD autonomic signal increase risk associated nicotine patch use . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical exam , include 12lead ECG .</criteria>
