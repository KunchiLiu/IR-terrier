	<brief_title>Reducing Symptom Burden - Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : It know study drug combination study drug well reduce side effect patient may experience chemoradiation therapy . For reason , researcher choose 4 study drug may help reduce side effect . The study drug test alone combination . Armodafinil design prevent excessive sleepiness . Bupropion antidepressant anti-inflammatory property may help reduce multiple symptom . Curcumin active ingredient spice , turmeric . It may interfere production cytokine ( cause inflammation ) , may reduce multiple symptom . Minocycline antibiotic . Minocycline show interrupt cytokine production , may help reduce multiple symptom . Study Groups : If agree take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) join 1 16 group . You may assign receive study drug , 1 study drug , combination 2 , 3 , 4 study drug . During study , may receive 1 placebo . A placebo look like study drug ( ) active ingredient . There chance group receive study drug . However , patient standard care treat doctor . Neither study staff see clinic know receive study drug and/or placebo ( ) . However , need safety , study staff able find study drug receiving . Study Drug Administration : You take study drugs/placebos every day 10 week . You take either single combine study drug ( ) placebos mouth everyday instruct study doctor . You give pamphlet information take study drugs/placebos . You give daily diary write take study drugs/placebo . You bring study drug/placebo blister packs/sticks clinic every study visit . You also bring diary every visit . Completing Symptom Questionnaire : Throughout study , ask complete symptom questionnaire . You ask symptom therapy may experience may interfere daily activity . The study staff either meet regular clinic visit call home time convenient . In clinic , complete questionnaire paper pen , enter answer electronic tablet computer . On phone , study staff ask question record answer paper enter computer . The symptom questionnaire take 5 minute complete . - During Weeks 1-10 , complete symptom questionnaire 2 time week . - During Weeks 11-16 , complete symptom questionnaire 1 time week . Study Visits : Before begin chemoradiation : - You complete 4 questionnaire pain symptom , mood , quality life . Completing 4 questionnaire take 15 minute . - You blood coagulation test , call PT-INR , make sure blood clot normally . - If woman able become pregnant , urine pregnancy test . The study staff give pregnancy test kit schedule visit , review record result test study prescription fill pharmacy . After 4 week chemoradiation : - You complete 1 questionnaire quality life . This questionnaire take 2-3 minute complete . - You blood coagulation test , call PT-INR , make sure blood clot normally . During last week chemoradiation ( Week 7 ) : -You complete 3 questionnaire symptom , mood , quality life . These questionnaire take 10 minute total complete . After Week 7 , study staff call 2 time week check week 10 . This phone call last minute . If experienced several side effect chemoradiation , phone call make take longer . About Week 12 ( routine clinical visit ) : - You complete 3 questionnaire symptom , mood , quality life . - If smoke begin study , complete questionnaire asks stop smoke time study . This take minute . - You blood coagulation test , call PT-INR , make sure blood clot normally . - You ask complete another questionnaire ask satisfaction study drug ( ) . This take minute . Length Study : You study 16 week . You take study drug ( ) 10 week complete symptom survey 16 week . You take study experience intolerable side effect . This investigational study . Armodafinil FDA approve commercially available treatment excessive sleepiness . Bupropion FDA approve commercially available treatment depression . Minocycline FDA approve commercially available treatment bacterial infection . Curcumin FDA approve . At time , curcumin use research . The different possible combination drug use study investigational . Up 32 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
