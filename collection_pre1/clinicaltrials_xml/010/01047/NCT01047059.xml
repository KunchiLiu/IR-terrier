	<brief_summary>The patient treat erlotinib bevacizumab six-week period . Imaging procedure perform baseline , one week therapy six week treatment . The combination erlotinib bevacizumab represent effective therapeutic strategy NSCLC high response rate ever report relapsed NSCLC observe recently phase II trial . Early differentiation patient profit patient profit therapy major relevance improve target therapy approach develop effective , personalized treatment strategy . We aim early identification combination molecular functional imaging tool ( FDG- , FLT-PET , DCE-MRI ) , molecular marker analyse tissue peripheral blood ( EGFR- KRAS mutational status high throughput mutational profiling tumor tissue , angiogenesis-associated biomarkers expression profile peripheral blood ) pharmokokinetic analysis . From combined analysis tool expect good understanding host-drug interaction precondition improvement erlotinib-bevacizumab combination therapy NSCLC</brief_summary>
