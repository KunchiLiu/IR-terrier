	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause adult disability third lead cause death United States . Unfortunately , therapy prove improve stroke outcome . Sleep apnea emerge stroke risk factor well establish association high mortality poor functional outcome follow stroke . Over half acute stroke patient sleep apnea , suggest may important target therapy . Attenuation sleep apnea severity may result improved stroke outcome . However , standard treatment sleep apnea well-tolerated among stroke patient . An alternative treatment avoidance supine sleep . Supine sleep common acute stroke patient , therefore treatment may particular relevance stroke population . The propose study conduct two phase . The first phase randomize , crossover design acute stroke patient give positional treatment ( avoid supine sleep ) one night stroke hospitalization . This compare another night sleep without positional therapy . The order treatment ( standard v positional therapy ) random . The first phase demonstrate proof concept : stroke patient give positional therapy avoid supine sleep ( 1 ) sleep less back , ( 2 ) improve sleep apnea parameter positional therapy . In second phase , identify sleep apnea randomize receive positional therapy home three month , standard therapy . This second phase demonstrate adherence/feasibility three month positional therapy , allow u estimate effect size base functional outcome measure . The data obtain pilot clinical trial essential plan large efficacy study .</brief_summary>
