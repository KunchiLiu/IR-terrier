	<brief_summary>Surgery block artery heart ( coronary artery bypass graft ) accomplish use vein leg sew onto heart provide alternate path blood flow , i.e . 'bypassing ' blockage . These vein block time . This may result part simply trauma surgery , word , remove vein leg sew heart . Another mechanism may abnormal metabolic process within body responsible plaque build-up heart artery first place - may lead blockage vein used bypass . In present era heart bypass surgery , incidence vein block remains high despite advance blood thinner cholesterol medication . This study design determine whether two new intervention may potentially reduce incidence blockage vein use heart bypass surgery . One surgical technique significantly reduce trauma associate remove leg vein prior use bypass graft onto heart . The second intervention use nutritional supplement surgery compose fish oil . The study recruit sufficient patient provide strong relevant conclusion regard study question . It highly applicable also include approximately 1,550 patient approximately 50 hospital across many country . We believe technique result significantly less vein blockage patient one year heart bypass surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Saphenous vein graft ( SVG ) remain widely use conduit CABG . However , contemporary patency rate one-year post CABG remain poor , despite optimal medical therapy . Recent trial ( PREVENT IV ) demonstrate 45 % patient one SVG occlude angiography one year post-CABG ; 25 % SVG occlude one year post-CABG angiography . Furthermore , patient least one SVG occlude twice incidence perioperative MI , thirteen time composite endpoint death , late MI repeat revascularization 12-18 month . The propose SUPERIOR SVG Trial prospective , international , multi-centre randomize controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) . It utilize factorial design elucidate benefit two intervention , one surgical pharmacological , improve saphenous vein graft patency coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) : Surgical Arm : Does novel atraumatic ( `` touch '' ) technique pedicled saphenous vein graft ( SVG ) harvest result improve angiographic patency clinical outcome 1 year , compare conventional SVG harvesting technique , patient undergo CABG . Rationale : A Swedish cardiac surgical centre publish numerous study demonstrate harvest SVG cushion surround fat without vein graft distension , `` touch '' technique , improved surrogate marker vein preservation operative specimen . Graft patency superior single small RCT ( 8.5 year patency : `` touch '' 90 % vs. conventional 76 % , p=0.01 , adjust OR 3.7 , 95 % CI 1.4-9.6 , p=0.007 ) . Pharmacological Arm : Does N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( fish oil ) oral supplementation result improve angiographic patency clinical outcome 1 year , compare placebo , patient undergo CABG . Rationale : In vivo study show level N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ; fish-oils ) inversely correlate risk coronary disease . Several large RCTs ( 40,000 patient aggregate ) perform diverse cardiovascular population , demonstrate moderate mortality benefit . A single RCT 90 's find SVG patency enhance fish oil . Methods : Each patient randomize SVG harvest conventional fashion ( open endoscopic ) use `` touch '' technique ( single-blinded ) . The pharmacological arm factorial design patient also randomize fish-oil placebo ( double-blinded ) start prior surgery continue 1 year . The primary outcome ( Surgical Arm : proportion study SVG graft occlude ; Pharmacological Arm : proportion patient ≥1 graft occlude ) 1 year CT angiography ( window 9-15 month ) compare treatment control group . Secondary endpoint include incidence 50-99 % study SVG stenosis 1 year , adverse event perioperative 1 year clinical event ( mortality , non-fatal MI , repeat revascularization ) . A sample size 615 patients/arm provide adequate statistical power ( Surgical Arm , Primary Outcome : study SVG graft occlusion , control event rate = 20 % , no-touch event rate = 14 % , RRR = 0.30 , β = 0.2 ; Pharmacological Arm , Primary Outcome : patient least 1 graft occlusion , control event rate = 30 % , fish oil event rate 22.5 % , RRR = 0.25 , β= 0.15 ) . The total sample size increase 25 % 1550 patient approximately 20 % recruited patient angiographic trial fail undergo follow-up angiography . Study patient enrol 39 month 50 center . Pilot funding secure CIHR-CANNeCTIN ass feasibility 50 patient 15 site . A single interim analysis perform follow completion 50 % CT angiogram , p &lt; 0.001 .</detailed_description>
