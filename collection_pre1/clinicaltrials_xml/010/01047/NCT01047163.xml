	<brief_summary>A major contributor frailty immobility elderly age relate loss muscle mass ( sarcopenia ) . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause mortality elderly , high blood cholesterol lipids major modifiable risk factor . Statins reduce blood cholesterol , muscle relate pain , tenderness discomfort ( myopathy ) adverse event associate statin therapy , old people much great risk . Statin myopathy present muscle ache weakness , without evidence muscle damage ; however underlie mechanisms responsible symptom poorly understood . Using animal model , applicant show main pathway regulate muscle protein synthesis inhibit statin myopathy , gene regulate muscle protein breakdown , inhibition muscle carbohydrate use inflammation dramatically increase . Therefore wish determine whether change see muscle old people symptoms statin myopathy , whether associate low muscle mass impaired muscle function compare old people history statin use . Identification mechanisms involve statin myopathy could lead effective therapy old people unable tolerate statin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maintenance Muscle Mass Older People : Negative Impact Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality elderly people account &gt; 208,000 death year , hyperlipidaemia major modifiable risk factor elderly . Statins inhibit synthesis cholesterol , therapy associate 30 % reduction cardiovascular event . Statins generally well tolerate , myopathic effect . Randomised trial suggest rhabdomyolysis ( &gt; 10 time upper limit normal serum creatine kinase ( CK ) ) rare , even myalgia myositis ( muscle ache weaknesses without increase serum CK , respectively ) , although common , highly prevalent . However , incidence adverse muscular event associate commonly prescribe statin , simvastatin , high , particularly high dos ( 18 % ) , give recommendation National Institute Health Care Excellence prescribe simvastatin statin , adverse muscular event could potentially increase increase use , particularly elderly far great risk [ 1 ] . Using animal model , applicant show principal pathway thought regulate muscle protein synthesis ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B ( PI3k/Akt ) signal pathway ) regulate simvastatin induce myopathy [ 2 ] . Furthermore , parallel mark regulation gene think increase muscle protein breakdown , impair carbohydrate oxidation , increase oxidative stress inflammation . We test hypothesis : ( ) That people 65 year age prescribe simvastatin , experience muscle related ache pain , present exacerbate muscle mass loss impaired muscle function ( strength fatigability ) compare age sex match control volunteer ( statin free ) . ( ii ) That signal pathway gene see dysregulated animal model simvastatin induce myopathy also dysregulated muscle old people prescribe simvastatin experience muscle related ache pain , may thereby underpin symptom associate statin myopathy . We recruit 15 , male volunteer &gt; 65 year age reporting myopathic symptom simvastatin administration 15 age sex match control volunteer ( statin free ) . Volunteers deem suitable entry statin myopathy group show elevate serum CK , muscle tenderness , reduce isometric strength [ age ] appropriate scoring muscle pain questionnaire . All volunteer undertake two experimental visit : Visit 1 determine body composition , muscle strength fatigability , Visit 2 undergo insulin clamp last 3 hour . Visit 1 involve measurement body composition use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , isometric strength fatigability knee extensor muscle use exercise dynamometer . Visit 2 involve muscle protein synthesis , leg protein breakdown glucose disposal determine , use prim constant infusion stable isotope label amino acid two-stage 180 min insulin clamp rest ( see detail protocol specific ) . In short , basal muscle biopsy obtain ( Vastus lateralis ) , serum insulin clamp fast concentration ( ~5 mU/l ) first 90 min , allow process govern protein breakdown occur without inhibitory effect raise serum insulin , follow second muscle biopsy . For remain 90 min , serum insulin raise equivalent fed state administration 30 milliunit ( mU ) .m-2.min-1 insulin , along variable infusion 20 % glucose maintain plasma glucose concentration 4.5 mmol.l-1 . Also constant infusion mix amino acid administer ( 10g per hour ) allow protein synthesis examine . Furthermore , insulin resistance estimate second 90 min measure leg glucose disposal . A third muscle biopsy sample obtain second 90 min period investigation . Determination muscle protein synthesis leg protein breakdown necessitate femoral vein catheter insert venous blood sampling , cannula insert retrograde superficial vein heat hand sample arterialised-venous blood , cannula place antecubital vein forearm infusion mixed amino acid , well octreotide , glucose insulin . Femoral arterial femoral venous blood flow determine use Doppler ultrasound , completely non-invasive . Body composition leg isometric strength fatigue determine ( Visit 1 ) . Muscle biopsy sample blood sample use determine rate muscle protein synthesis , breakdown glucose disposal . Muscle biopsy sample also use examine expression gene protein regulate muscle protein balance , inflammation carbohydrate metabolism . Sample size base observed increase atrophy gene ( MAFbx ) expression muscle statin treated individual [ 3 ] . A 2 fold increase MAFbx messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) ( standard deviation = 0.3 fold ) report muscle 8 individual treat statin experience myopathic symptom compare control . Therefore , assume power 80 % , 7 subject would require detect effect . Being conservative , account drop out , recruit 15 volunteer per group ensure sufficient statistical power . There currently measure muscle protein synthesis , degradation anabolic signal protein people report statin myopathy base additional power calculation , study people 65-85 year age measurement make applicant involved similar number men woman .</detailed_description>
