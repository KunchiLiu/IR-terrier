	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , include pulmonary embolism ( PE ) deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , common complication lead cause death cancer patient . Large , population-based study show patient cancer four- seven-fold increase risk develop VTE compare patient without cancer . VTE would frequent patient advanced gastric cancer , especially associate chemotherapy . However , relatively study conduct regard incidence VTE Asian cancer patient . According previous review , Asian patient significantly low risk develop VTE . The rate VTE advance gastric cancer , associate chemotherapy know Asian patient . In addition , impact VTE overall survival document patient .</brief_summary>
