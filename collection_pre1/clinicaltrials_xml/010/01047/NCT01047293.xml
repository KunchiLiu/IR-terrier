	<brief_summary>RAD001 ( everolimus ) novel oral derivative rapamycin . RAD001 clinical development since 1996 immunosuppressant solid organ transplantation obtain marketing authorization ( Certican® ) prophylaxis rejection renal cardiac transplantation number country , include majority European Union . RAD001 development patient various malignancy since 2002 . RAD001 investigate anticancer agent base potential act : - Directly tumor cell inhibit tumor cell growth proliferation - Indirectly inhibit angiogenesis lead reduced tumor vascularity ( via potent inhibition tumor cell HIF-1 activity , VEGF production VEGF-induced proliferation endothelial cell ) . The role angiogenesis maintenance solid tumor growth well establish , mTOR pathway implicate regulation tumor production proangiogenic factor well modulation VEGFR signal endothelial cell . At weekly daily schedule various dos explore , RAD001 generally well tolerate . The frequent adverse event ( rash , mucositis , fatigue headache ) associate RAD001 therapy manageable . Non-infectious pneumonitis report mTOR inhibitor commonly low-grade reversible . Both FOLFOX bevacizumab well establish treatment metastatic colorectal carcinoma . FOLFOX-6 combine safely Bevacizumab currently phase 3 test adjuvant therapy commonly use first line treatment regimen metastatic colorectal cancer 25 . There enhanced interest development effective regimen colorectal cancer . RAD001 mTOR inhibitor preclinical clinical activity colorectal cancer . RAD001 downregulates mTOR pathway lead direct antiproliferative effect well decrease production Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor . A combination RAD001 10 mg per day combination Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week show efficacious safe . In another trial , RAD001 show many patient stable disease clearly need give combination therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient population Phase I portion : Metastatic colorectal cancer . A total 3 patient cohort . Additional 3 patient tolerable cohort . Total patient number : Minimum 6 , Maximum : 12 Phase II portion : Metastatic colorectal cancer : A total 33 patient treated portion . This include patient treat tolerable dose level phase I trial . The statistical justification indicate Statistics section 7 . Overall study design Phase I Study : A three cohort dose escalation use . Cycle length 28 day . Bevacizumab FOLFOX-6 RAD001 Cohort 1 : 5 mg/ kg Q 2weeks Standard Dose FOLFOX-6 2.5 mg PO qd Cohort 2 : 5 mg/ kg Q 2weeks Standard Dose FOLFOX-6 5 mg PO qd Cohort 3 : 5mg/kg Q 2 week Standard Dose FOLFOX-6 10 mg PO qd Phase II Study : For Phase II portion primary endpoint Progression Free Survival 6 month . Study Objectives Primary 1 . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) combination FOLFOX+ Bevacizumab + RAD001 previously untreated metastatic advanced colorectal cancer 2 . To evaluate safety combination daily dose 2.5mg RAD001 , 5 mg RAD001 10 mg RAD001 ( Phase 1 part ) Secondary 1 . To study toxicity profile combination 2 . To study Response Rate ( RR ) combination 3 . To determine serum proteomic profile patient treated combination therapy ( Both phase I II portion ) Dose selection RAD001 In phase 1 clinical study RAD001 monotherapy agent oncology patient , side-effect profile essentially mild moderate adverse event low frequency DLT daily dose 10 mg/d . Based PK/PD model , daily dose 10mg RAD001 assume provide persistently high degree target inhibition tumor [ Investigators ' Brochure-Section 4.1.1.3 ] . In addition , preliminary data phase 1 study , change molecular characteristic tumor induce treatment RAD001 dose 5 10 mg/d investigate , confirm pharmacodynamic activity predict previously PK/PD model [ Investigators ' Brochure-Section 4.1.1.3 ] . Therefore , dose 10 mg/d ensure adequate drug target inhibition patient , take consideration know inter-patient variability drug level ( CV approx 50 % ) . In study , begin RAD001 dose 2.5 mg low dose administer daily basis . If dose tolerable ( &lt; 1/6 DLTs ) , escalate dose RAD001 ( 5 mg ) third cohort 10 mg . If cohort 1 intolerable , study close without expansion . On dose level , 3 patient would enrol . If 0/3 DLTs , would able escalate dose level . If 1/3 DLTs observe , 3 additional patient enrol dose level . The intent escalate dose level &lt; 1/6 DLTs observe . In case 2 DLTs observe particular dose level , dose escalation possible . This dose level would deem intolerable low dose level would expand . The definition Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) high dose level RAD001 combine FOLFOX/ Bevacizumab &lt; 1/6 DLTs . FOLFOX/ Bevacizumab : FOLFOX6 Bevacizumab give previously describe 28. mFOLFOX6 ( oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV LV 350 mg IV 2 hour plus FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus 2,400 mg/m2continuous infusion 46 hour every 2 week ) combine Bevacizumab give 5 mg/kg every 2 week . Dose modification carry chemotherapy per label oxaliplatin , fluorouracil bevacizumab .</detailed_description>
