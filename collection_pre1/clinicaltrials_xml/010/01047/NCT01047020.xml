	<brief_summary>The primary goal study provide comprehensive objective information impairment musculoskeletal health , sensory function , fitness among large group childhood ALL survivor , define high risk group assess treatment factor contribute impaired function . This study include direct , objective evaluation musculoskeletal function , sensory capacity , fitness , physical activity pattern among adult treat childhood ALL St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) 1980 1999 . Among 899 ALL survivor , eligible institutionally funded clinical study medical late effect , study recruit 364 participate evaluation . The study also recruit 364 individual comparison group , frequency match race/ethnicity , age gender .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study focus follow primary objective : 1 . Enumerate prevalence musculoskeletal , sensory , fitness impairment among adult survivor childhood ALL . The study hypothesize adult survivor childhood ALL high prevalence musculoskeletal , sensory fitness impairment control group frequency match race/ethnicity , age , gender . 2 . Evaluate association personal treatment factor musculoskeletal , sensory fitness impairment . The study hypothesize : - Female gender , young age diagnosis , cranial radiation associate decreased lean body mass . - Female gender , young age diagnosis , type glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone vs. prednisone ) treatment associate muscle weakness . - Sensory loss vary function age , participant diagnose 12+ year age demonstrate vincristine related sensory loss , diagnose &lt; 12 year age demonstrate dexamethasone and/or intrathecal methotrexate related sensory loss . - Fitness impairment evident participant receive 100 mg/m2+ anthracyclines . The study focus secondary objective : 1 . Compare physical activity pattern adult survivor childhood ALL frequency match control group . The study hypothesize adult survivor childhood ALL demonstrate low level physical activity measure activity monitor ( accelerometer ) , report low level overall physical activity , compare member comparison group . 2 . Describe association habitual physical activity energy expenditure among ALL survivor . The study hypothesize activity level , measure accelerometer , positively correlate energy expenditure , measure use doubly labeled water technique . 3 . Explore association musculoskeletal sensory health , physical activity pattern among adult survivor childhood ALL . The study hypothesize adult survivor childhood ALL low proportion lean muscle mass and/or sensory loss indicate peripheral neuropathy demonstrate low level physical activity .</detailed_description>
