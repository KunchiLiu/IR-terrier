	<brief_summary>The transdermal nicotine patch widely use form tobacco dependence treatment US Europe , smoker unable successfully quit form treatment . Failure respond treatment may , large extent , due use nicotine patch 8 week , recommend treatment duration . We find control randomized clinical trial use nicotine patch 24 week increase quit rate significantly . We propose clinical trial replicate extend result community set real-world , use research design utilized clinical trial demonstrate effectiveness methadone maintenance therapy opiate dependence . Specifically , 540 smoker receive counsel standard ( 8-weeks ) , extend ( 24-weeks ) , maintenance ( 52 week ) therapy transdermal nicotine patch . The main outcome biochemically-verified smoking cessation week 52 . The cost-effectiveness , safety , mechanism effect ( e.g. , promotion recovery follow lapse ) maintenance therapy transdermal nicotine also assess . The study result may change treat nicotine dependence transdermal nicotine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Effectiveness Trial Maintenance Therapy Nicotine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transdermal nicotine patch widely use form tobacco dependence treatment US Europe . Yet , abstinence rate follow patch treatment ~20 % 6-months ~9 % 12-months . There grow recognition nicotine dependence chronic disease , like asthma diabetes , require maintenance therapy . While current guideline establish USDHHS 's Public Health Service ( PHS ) recommend 8-week duration transdermal nicotine therapy , support recommendation limit . In recent randomized placebo-controlled efficacy trial compare standard ( 8-week ) vs. extend ( 24-weeks ) treatment nicotine patch , find , 24 week , point-prevalence abstinence rate 30 % 24-week arm vs. 20 % standard therapy arm ( p &lt; .05 ) ; however , week 52 , 6 month treatment discontinue extended treatment arm , quit rate equivalent across treatment arm . This first clinical trial suggest benefit extend treatment transdermal nicotine largely dependent continuation active treatment . However , efficacy trial , study conduct highly-controlled condition strict inclusion/exclusion criterion enhance internal validity . If recommendation duration nicotine patch therapy formally revise encourage maintenance therapy , finding must replicate extended `` real-world circumstance '' effectiveness trial . In addition , do clinical trial support use methadone maintenance opiate dependence , replication study must include treatment arm receive maintenance therapy throughout duration trial ( 52 week ) . Thus , propose conduct randomize effectiveness trial evaluate benefit maintenance therapy transdermal nicotine patch smoke cessation . Specifically , 540 smoker receive brief counsel randomize : standard ( 8-weeks ) , extend ( 24-weeks ) , maintenance ( 52 week ) transdermal nicotine therapy . The primary outcome biochemically verify 7-day point prevalence abstinence week 52 . Additional study aim include assess : 1 ) treatment side effect across study arm ; 2 ) longitudinal pattern relapse recovery across treatment arm ; 3 ) mediator moderator treatment effect ; 4 ) cost-effectiveness . Overall , trial finding provide critical data future PHS review maintenance therapy transdermal nicotine subsequent treatment guideline ; third-party payer assessment maintenance transdermal nicotine cover benefit ; individual smoker ' decision use maintenance transdermal nicotine over-the-counter access . In turn , study may help attain Healthy People 2010 goal reduce US rate tobacco use .</detailed_description>
