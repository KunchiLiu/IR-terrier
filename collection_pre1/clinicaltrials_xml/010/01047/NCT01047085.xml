In study , controversial relationship cholecystolithiasis , cholecystectomy GERD discuss impedance pH method start use recent year , method indicate gas liquid ( acid non-acid ) gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) esophageal clearance time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Cholecystectomy Increase Esophageal Alkaline Reflux ? Evaluation Impedance-pH Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gallstones observe among 6-20 % people world 2 fold woman men . The symptomatic treatment cholecystolithiasis cholecystectomy know every year United States America ( USA ) 750.000 cholecystectomy operation perform . Usually apply laparoscopic surgery , experience hand great success , application without problem cause condition call postcholecystectomy syndrome . Postcholecystectomy syndrome heterogeneous condition may occur depend many cause . One suggest reason increase gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GER ) . Publications indicate increase GER cholecystectomy available . Relationship gallbladder stone reflux ; whether reflux increase cholecystectomy controversial subject . In current study , assessment reflux perform different technique interview , endoscopy 24-hour pH monitoring . These evaluation often useful detect acid reflux . Whereas known cholecystectomy alkaline bile reflux may determine stomach . Therefore , determination bile reflux esophagus cholecystectomy also possible . This situation may important term esophagus adenocarcinoma , esophagus adenocarcinoma generally develop basis Barrett 's esophagus alkaline reflux accept contribute develop Barrett 's esophagus ( 13 ) . Bile reflux stomach report rate 30-100 % stomach surgery 80-90 % gallbladder surgery . Even though bile reflux observe high percentage , every kind bile reflux damage gastric esophageal mucosa . Leaking stomach ( reflux ) , bile pancreatic secretion present duodenum content mix hydrochloric acid pepsin present stomach , thereby damage occurs gastric esophageal mucosa . The continuation interaction may develop gastritis , esophagitis . The increase alkaline reflux importance know development Barrett 's esophagus , component GER spectrum develop adenocarcinoma . As result research perform people cholecystectomy , risk develop esophageal cancer show increase moderately . This probably duo reflux bile find duodenum content esophagus . Nowadays acid reflux determine widely use 24-hour pH-meter . The bile-sensitive Bilitec difficult method implement widely use . Impedance-pH recently develop technique use monitor kind reflux ( gas , liquid , acides non-acides ) , reflux level clearance period esophagus . The purpose study : To investigate relationship GER , cholecystolithiasis cholecystectomy use Impedance-pH method .</detailed_description>
