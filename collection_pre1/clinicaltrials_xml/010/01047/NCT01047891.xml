	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Sorafenib With Topotecan Patients With Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer continue lead cause cancer-related death woman lead cause death attribute gynecologic malignancy . Because ovarian cancer usually asymptomatic early stage , disease often spread outside pelvic region time diagnosis require debulking surgery follow systemic chemotherapy . First-line chemotherapy involve platinum-based treatment , include widely adopt regimen cisplatin/paclitaxel , carboplatin/paclitaxel , single-agent carboplatin . Although regimens yield relatively satisfactory tumor response rate , majority patient experience disease recurrence receive additional treatment . For patient , number antitumor agent novel mechanism action ( topotecan , gemcitabine , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin , docetaxel , etoposide ) apply , addition retreatment platinum , goal re-establishing remission disease control , minimize disease-related symptom , improve quality life , extend patient survival . Of agent , topotecan ( Hycamtin® ; GlaxoSmithKline ) one best-characterized agent recurrent set . Topotecan S-phase 1-dependent cytotoxic agent target topoisomerase I enzyme exhibit broad activity solid tumor approve treatment recurrent ovarian cancer US western country . Data preclinical clinical study report last 2 year demonstrate importance several proangiogenic factor tumorigenesis prognosis ovarian cancer , suggest possible new target antiangiogenic therapy . Once-daily oral treatment Sorafenib produce broad spectrum antitumor efficacy preclinical tumor model include also xenograft model ovarian carcinoma . Preliminary antitumor activity report single ovarian cancer patient several phase I phase II study . Most promising strategy therapy advance recurrent ovarian cancer seem combination cytotoxic agent targeted therapy . Furthermore oral therapy achieve maintain long term tumor control seem attractive . Therefore Sorafenib Topotecan would make rational therapeutic strategy combination recurrent ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
