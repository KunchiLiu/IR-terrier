	<brief_summary>Consumption low glycemic index ( GI ) diet show improve glycaemic control type 2 diabetic ( Brandâˆ’Miller et al. , 2003 ; Jenkins et al. , 2008 ) . In addition benefit glycaemic control evidence acute improvement cognitive performance consumption low GI food compare high GI food adult ( Benton et al. , 2003 ; Kaplan et al. , 2000 ) adolescent ( Ingwersen et al. , 2007 ; Smith Foster , 2008 ) . Given finding possible low GI focus dietary intervention design improve glycaemic control health outcome diabetic patient could also improve cognitive function patient . This particular relevance light evidence associate type 2 diabetes cognitive decrement ( Awad et al. , 2004 ; Stewart Loilitsa 1999 ; van Harten et al. , 2006 ) . To date two study type 2 diabetic report low GI breakfast associate increase verbal memory performance compare high GI breakfast ( Greenwood et al. , 2003 ; Papanikolaou et al . 2006 ) . Further research investigate benefit low GI food cognition . The aim study examine effect high low glycaemic index breakfast cognitive performance adult type 2 diabetes . Participants perform battery cognitive test consume 3 different breakfast ( high GI , low GI , water ) 3 different test day . The participant recruit general public Leeds Teaching Hospital diabetes clinic . This research benefit development specific dietary behaviour aim reduce diabetes related cognitive decline . This research part PhD fund Economic Social Research Council University Leeds .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects High Low GI Breakfasts Cognitive Performance Adults With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conform randomise mixed design . Both diabetic experimental group control group take part three condition whereby participant receive high GI , low GI , water breakfast deliver counterbalanced order . Participants perform battery cognitive test 2 occasion throughout morning ; 30 minute breakfast 180 minute breakfast . Blood glucose measure capillary finger-prick blood sample use diabetic glucose meter throughout morning .</detailed_description>

Vision sufficiently good complete cognitive testing ( use glass and/or lens ) . Dementia ( indicate use Mini Mental State Examination &lt; 26 ) Current ( recent i.e . last 6 month ) cigarette smoker Neurological disorder Previous stroke Medication diabetes treatment medication direct effect brain likely influence cognitive function . Coexistent diabetic complication consider exclusion criterion unless result inability complete cognitive testing ( e.g . insufficient vision ) . These exclusion criterion choose basis factor affect cognitive performance . Given cognitive test involve learn English word , participant English first language include different cognitive process use learn nonnative language ( Wong et al. , 2004 ) . Ethnicity influence glucose regulation risk diabetes . Given part research examine relationship glucose regulation cognition important potential confounds ethnicity/genetic propensity diabetes control .</criteria>
