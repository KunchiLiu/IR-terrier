	<brief_title>Compare Methadone Combined With N-Acetyl-Cysteine ( NAC ) Methadone Alone Opioids Astaining</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material abuse nowadays become serious public health issue , among , abuse opioids serious one . It cause HIV infection rate hiking , recent year Taiwan , impair people health well . The successive 2 year methadone substitutive abstain program make HIV infection rate remarkable decrease proven public health program successful control HIV spreading . However , methadone substitutive abstain program reduce physically psychologically dependent opioids opioid abuser , collateral benefit reduce related criminal behavior dangerous contagious behavior , share hyperdermic needle . On hand , use methadone still cause sort material dependent , example , part participant methadone substitutive abstaining program still keep use heroin , change amount become less , even divert another illegal drug , compare participate program . In word , methadone substitutive abstain program alleviate dependence drug abuser drug , cure . In pas , study use methadone medicine eradicate dependence , still effective way approach , still long way go . Previous study find N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , slimy solvent ingredient human body , mean extra-cellular glutamate exchange mechanism , maintain glutamate concentration inside raphe , also alleviate motivation behavior addictive patient . From previous report , N-acetylcysteine could silver bullet opiods addiction patient . The clinical use N-acetylcysteine well establish safety well tolerance . N-acetylcysteine acetyl-derivative human essential amino acid ; molecular weight 163.2 , white crystal chemical . N-acetylcysteine use clinical year , type intravenous injection , oral spray , use respiratory related disease , phlegm reducer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis ; besides , N-acetylcysteine combine toxic metabolite , acetaminophen , prevent lever necrosis acetaminophen intoxication , therefore , antidote acetaminophen intoxication . Other FAD approve clinical use , N-acetylcysteine seem clinical benefit illness kidney developer , promote function central nerve system . N-acetylcysteine also consider improve cognition amnesia schizophrenia . Besides , oral N-acetylcysteine usually regard help health ; sell grocery , also accept public diet supplement . According long term study oral N-acetylcysteine patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , minor side-effects , mostly uncomfortable intestine stomach , example , nausea , vomit diarrhea . As antidote N-acetylcysteine , case report caused hypertension , chest distress , rectum breeding , respiratory distress , headache , fatigue , fever rash ; symptom intoxication acetaminophen , hard judge side-effects come one . The side-effects intravenous N-acetylcysteine include vomit diarrhea ; case indicate 45 ( 8 % ) 529 patient acetaminophen intoxication show allergic reaction , skin hypersensitive reaction , rash , itch , 18 show whole-body allergy include , bronchospasm , angioedema vomit etc . Those allergy alleviate antihistamine , steroid adrenalin . Other researcher find patient 3 fold systemic allergy asthma history history . In general , medicine allergic history increase danger allergic reaction . One case report show 2 year old girl , acetaminophen intoxication patient , cause serious epilepsy treat intravenous injection . Conclude oral intravenous N-acetylcysteine safe clinical use , case could cause serious side-effects ( especially intravenous type N-acetylcysteine ) , need careful . From result animal test 2008 , give N-acetylcysteine daily suppress experimental animal addiction behavior , even still hold valid 40 day stop injection . Another animal test use male Sprague-Dawley similar result . According previous result , N-acetylcysteine use alleviation addiction behavior proven certain effectiveness , combine methadone substitutive abstain program , increase successful rate . In study , double-blind prospective study use , methadone substitutive abstain program compare N-acetylcysteine use . This experiment expect methadone come alone N-acetylcysteine opioid abstain good result control group methadone alone 6 month period .</detailed_description>
