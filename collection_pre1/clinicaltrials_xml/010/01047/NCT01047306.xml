	<criteria>1a . Documented deficiency HNS enzyme activity less equal 10 % low limit normal range measure fibroblast leukocyte ( base normal range diagnosis MPS IIIA laboratory acceptable Shire HGT ) . AND 1b . Normal enzyme activity level least one sulfatase ( rule multiple sulfatase deficiency ) measure fibroblast leukocyte ( base normal range laboratory acceptable Shire HGT ) . 2.Patient great equal 1 year age developmental age great equal 1 year . 3 . Patient medically stable accommodate protocol requirement , include travel assessment , without place undue burden patient/patient 's family . 4 . Voluntarily sign IRB/IECapproved informed consent ( assent applicable ) form . The patient 's , patient 's parent legally authorize representative ( ) consent patient 's assent appropriate , must obtain . 1 . Patient significant nonMPS IIIArelated CNS impairment behavioral disturbance , would confound scientific integrity interpretation study assessment , determine investigator . 2 . Patients , MPS IIIA behavioralrelated reason , opinion investigator , would preclude performance study neurocognitive developmental testing procedure . 3 . Patients pregnant , breast feeding , female patient childbearing potential , comply use acceptable method birth control condom , barrier method , oral contraception , etc . 4 . Patient blind and/or deaf . 5 . Patient know suspected hypersensitivity anesthesia think unacceptably high risk anesthesia due airway compromise condition . 6 . Patient patient family history neuroleptic malignant syndrome , malignant hyperthermia , anesthesiarelated concern . 7 . The Investigator may choose exclude patient complication result prior lumbar puncture . 8 . Patient history poorly control seizure disorder . 9 . Patient history intracranial pressure ( ICP ) open CSF pressure upon lumbar puncture exceed 30 cm water definitively treat . 10 . Patient currently receive psychotropic medication investigator 's opinion , would likely substantially confound test result . 11 . Patient sustain absence aspirin , nonsteroidal , medication affect blood clotting within 1 week prior relevant study related procedure ( eg , lumbar puncture applicable ) , ingested medication within 1 week procedure change clot activity would deleterious . 12 . Patient receive treatment investigational drug device intend treatment MPS IIIA within 30 day prior , study , currently enrol another study involve investigational drug device ( enrollment Safety followup contact ) . 13 . Patient receive hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplant . 14 . Patient 's assent unattainable , patient 's parent ( ) , patient 's legally authorize representative ( ) is/are unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study , do/does agree comply protocol define schedule assessment . 15 . The patient item ( brace , tattoo , etc . ) would exclude patient able undergo MRI accord local Institutional Policy , patient situation would exclude patient undergoing procedure require study .</criteria>
