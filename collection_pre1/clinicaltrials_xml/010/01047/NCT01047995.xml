	<brief_summary>The study aim help u understand HIV drug darunavir ( take ritonavir ) raltegravir affect give time . The purpose study ass pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb , distribute eliminate body ) darunavir ritonavir take without raltegravir . The duration study 50 day plus screening visit take place 4 week prior start study , follow visit take place 1-2 week last dose study medication . Subjects continue take 2 usual drug ( call nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor -NRTI ) throughout study . For first 21 day subject take usual NRTI plus raltegravir 400mg twice daily . After , subject also receive either : Group 1 ) Darunavir/ritonavir 800mg/100mg daily AND raltegravir 400mg twice daily Group 2 ) Darunavir/ritonavir 800mg/100mg daily AND raltegravir 800mg daily Subjects take regimen 14 day . Subjects randomly allocate either Group 1 2 . You equal ( 50/50 ) chance allocate Group 1 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The integrase inhibitor raltegravir show potent new agent treatment HIV infection . When raltegravir darunavir/ritonavir combine Benchmark study , provide excellent virological response highly experienced patient . Darunavir daily use increase due patient ' preference daily regimens . Raltegravir show pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship dose 100 400 mg twice daily show similar virological response . This may due intracellular drug accumulation . However , data use darunavir/r plus raltegravir daily raltegravir intracellular concentration available . Whether raltegravir efficacious administer daily unknown . However , concentration higher IC95 33nM associate favourable virological response . Therefore , would like investigate plasma intracellular pharmacokinetics darunavir/ritonavir raltegravir co-administered daily order provide data support use agent daily , patient ' prefer dosing schedule . Pharmacogenetics hold promise HIV treatment complexity potential toxicity multi antiretroviral drug therapy prescribe long period . Thus far , candidate gene examine limited number allelic variant , number confirm association already emerge . From public health perspective , antiretroviral medication become increasingly available racially ethnically diverse population worldwide , understanding genetic structure population may allow u anticipate impact adverse response , even group represent drug registration trial . The exist literature pharmacogenetic determinant antiretroviral drug exposure , drug toxicity , well genetic marker associate rate disease progression underline recent advance occur past year . However , expect larger-scale comprehensive genome approach profoundly change landscape knowledge future . Additional study need assess implication long-term response antiretroviral agent . For reason plan collect single blood sample participant intensive pharmacokinetic study , one , order able investigate association genetic polymorphism drug disposition gene ( encode cytochrome P450 isoenzymes transmembrane transporter ) drug exposure . A candidate gene approach utilised examine locus interest . This procedure provide potentially important information genetic influence plasma drug concentration give insight improve management HIV-infected patient individualise therapy . These study power genetic association enable u build data base genotype-phenotype . Prospective genetic study would need plan base preliminary data .</detailed_description>
