	<criteria>1 . Male female 18 85 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . 2 . A male female eligible enroll participate study he/she : 1 . ( Part 1 ) Moderate Severe Renal Impairment ( equivalent NKF KDOQI Stage 3 4 , receive dialysis ) determine estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) calculate abbreviated MDRD equation , expect go dialysis ≥ 8 week first administration investigational product . Stage 5 , nondialysis patient eGFR 10 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 also eligible Part 1 casebycase basis . 2 . ( Part 2 ) Severe Renal Impairment stable hemodialysis treatment 1 month prior Screening ( subject plan transition hemodialysis ) 3 month prior Screening ( subject emergently place hemodialysis ) . These subject equivalent NKF KDOQI Stage 5 . 3. otherwise healthy consider clinically stable respect underlie renal impairment respect underlying/chronic disease determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . 4. clinical laboratory test result consider clinically stable opinion principal investigator , especially clinical abnormality laboratory parameter deem associated patient 's underlying renal impairment . 3 . Meets follow erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESA ) criterion : 1 . The patient ESA naïve OR 2 . If patient schedule ESA interval ≤ 7 day , ESA treatment must discontinue least 7 day OR 3 . If patient schedule ESA interval &gt; 7 day , ESA treatment must discontinue least scheduled interval length ( eg discontinue ≥ 14 day schedule 14 day ESA interval ) AND The patient resume ESA treatment completion Followup Visit ( Day 57 ) . 4 . Has hemoglobin value : 1 . For ESA naïve patient : ≤11.0 g/dL 2 . For patient receive ongoing ESA treatment : ≤11.5 g/dL Screening check value ≤11.0 g/dL appropriate ESA discontinuation accord Inclusion 3 prior commence study drug dosing . 5 . 5 . Has serum ferritin Screening : 1 . ≥40 μg/L absence microcytic hypochromic RBCs ( regardless transferrin saturation % ) OR 2 . 2539 μg/L transferrin saturation % ≥20 % ( fraction saturation ≥0.20 ) absence microcytic hypochromic RBCs 6 . Has Vitamin B12 folate low limit normal Screening 7 . A female patient eligible participate : 1. childbearing potential , must agree use one contraception method Section 8.1.1 . This criterion must follow time Screening completion Followup Visit ( Day 57 ) OR 2. nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method Section 8.1.1 wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . 8 . Male patient must agree use one contraception method list Section 8.1.2 . This criterion must follow time first dose study drug completion Followup Visit ( Day 57 ) . 9 . Body weight ≥ 45 kg 10 . QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 msec patient bundle branch block . These base average triplicate value obtain Screening . 11 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . 1 . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month prior Screening one following : evidence autoimmune anemia prior antiviral therapy evidence liver damage 2 . A positive test HIV antibody . 3 . A prestudy drug screen positive due drug use associate current medication prescription . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids benzodiazepine . 4 .

History malignancy tumor within 5 year prior Screening receive medication cancer . Nonmelanoma skin cancer within past 5 year definitively remove allow . 15 . Patients preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , and/or hepatic function could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Examples condition could interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility include gastrointestinal bypass surgery , partial total gastrectomy , small bowel resection , vagotomy , malabsorption , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , celiac sprue . Examples condition could interfere hepatic function include Gilberts syndrome . 16 . Active infection acute inflammatory disease determine clinical assessment . 17 . Class III heart failure evidence recent progression ( worsen dyspnea , hospitalization within 23 month symptom , etc ) , Class IV heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system . 18 .
