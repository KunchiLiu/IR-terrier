	<brief_summary>The aim present study compare outcomes standard care effect exercise alone , exercise combine nutrition counseling , post-transplantation weight gain quality life renal transplant recipient ( RTR ) . The primary outcome post-transplantation weight gain cardiometabolic risk , quality life regard physical functioning . Our secondary outcome barrier success factor regard lifestyle intervention RTR , barrier success factor intervention healthcare professional , long-term adherence physical activity follow-up phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient graft survival first year renal transplantation improve substantially last decade , long-term graft loss patient mortality remain high . It increasingly recognize alarmingly poor cardio-metabolic risk profile renal transplant recipient ( RTR ) play main role long-term outcome . Improvement long-term outcome require specific effort improve cardio-metabolic profile complication . Importantly , substantial increase body weight body fat occur transplantation major trigger poor cardiometabolic profile RTR , include post-transplant diabetes metabolic syndrome . The increase body weight mostly fat tissue typically around 9-10 kg . Most weight gain ( ~90 % ) occur first year transplantation . Recent data indicate steroid avoidance could prevent early increase adiposity . This warrant specific focus lifestyle factor , i.e diet physical activity . In UMCG RTR cohort find lack physical activity relate bad cardiometabolic profile independent predictor mortality . Moreover , substantial increase fat massweight gain strongly relate low physical activity , high intake energy-dense drink , low consumption vegetable , increase plasma triglyceride metabolic syndrome . The intake salt saturate fat high fibre intake low , indicate dietary habit deviate substantially recommendation healthy diet . Thus , physical activity dietary habit important target lifestyle intervention RTR . Lasting improvement lifestyle notoriously difficult obtain , recent year substantial intervention expertise develop high risk group include prediabetes . It establish fFor long term purpose , prevention excessive weight gain effective treatment weight excess . Since RTR weight gain first year transplantation , prevention promise approach . Moreover , data prediabetes suggest combine intervention target diet physical activity may particularly effective purpose . Therefore , aim prevent development adiposity adverse cardiometabolic effect combine diet-and-physical activity program RTR first year transplantation . This randomize control intervention study use combine diet-and-physical activity approach . After hospital discharge transplantation , 219 patient randomize three either control group : one group , receive standard care , one group expose 3-month exercise program follow individual counsel one group expose exercise program + dietary intervention follow individual counselling . The 3-month exercise protocolprogram intervention group enrol adopt `` Group rehabilitation renal patient '' project Maastricht . fitness program ( 2 time per week , first three month ) receive.The individual counselling consolidate achieve promote healthy diet level physical activity provide erformed ( 15 month inclusion throughout whole year ) . This counsel base theory behavioural change motivational interviewing . Daily physical activity evaluate pedometer dietary habit questionnaire food record . As outcome parameter , iIncrease adiposity change renal function , glucose metabolism cardio-metabolic risk factor assess baseline , 3 15 12 month inclusion . As additional benefit , intervention may improve quality life social participation , assess well . Furthermore , barrier intervention success , lack reference knowledge healthy nutrition fear exercise identify optimize efficacy current intervention facilitate future implementation .</detailed_description>
