	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect 48 v 24 week treatment Peginterferon alfa-2b plus weight-based ribavirin Sustained Virologic Response ( SVR ) relapse rate patient infect genotype 3 chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) achieve Rapid Virologic Response ( RVR ) attain complete Early Virologic Response ( cEVR ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study plan address issue whether increase duration therapy 24 week 48 week PegIFNα2b 1.5mg/kg/week use weight-based ribavirin ( 15mg/kg ) may reduce relapse rate thereby increase SVR rate patient infect genotype 3 fail achieve RVR achieve complete cEVR define undetectable HCV RNA ( ie . &lt; 50 &lt; 15 IU/ml 12 week ) . This study necessary although patient genotype 3 ultimately become HCV RNA undetectable treatment , relapse discontinuation therapy remain major cause failure achieve SVR . This important issue give date none new small molecule drug appear effective genotype 3 meaning present time patient genotype 3 infection option . Relapse particularly common patient advanced liver disease show SVR achieve patient advanced disease , risk liver failure significantly reduce , may risk hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . As consequence need liver transplantation diminish survival improve . Identifying strategy reduce relapse improve rate SVR therefore critical . Certain individual great risk infection genotype 3 . In Western world , main risk group current former drug user ( IDU ) immigrant raise South Asia ( India Pakistan ) infection likely occur early childhood due exposure contaminate instrument , needle , etc . A second potential benefit achieve SVR reduction rate diabetes . Diabetes demonstrate common infected Hepatitis C general population - observation make examination NHANES population base database . The prelude development Type 2 diabetes insulin resistance . Insulin resistance ( IR ) present one third patient chronically infect HCV - rate high cirrhosis overweight obese . Early data indicates although presence insulin resistance impairs interferon responsiveness SVR achieve , insulin resistance lose . Studies IR individual infect genotype 3 HCV lacking . Independent HCV infection , bear South Asian risk factor Type 2 diabetes . The issue insulin resistance effectiveness antiviral therapy chronic hepatitis C address exclusively Caucasians infect genotype 1 . Recent data Japan indicate patient diabetes hepatitis C successful eradication HCV RNA may simultaneously prevent subsequent diabetes presumably systemic complication disease . There little data rate RVR South Asian population therapeutic trial patient genotype 3 infection report Pakistan India . Estimates obtain study perform Caucasians Northern Europe North America . In trial Shiffman rate RVR genotype 3 infection 62 % preliminary report trial Albuferon genotype 2 3 indicate RVR rate range 44-60 % Asians -this figure include Asians . There several reason specifically address way improve outcome antiviral therapy patient infect genotype 3 CHC . Firstly virtually treatment study report combine rate SVR achieve genotype 2 3 even though evidence suggest response therapy different two genotype . Within population patient genotype 3 infection , may differences well . South Asians predominantly infect genotype 3a , injection drug user typically genotype 3b infection . There formal trial publish English literature antiviral therapy South Asians compare subtypes genotype 3 . In patient infected genotype 1 slow response antiviral therapy i.e . lack RVR , associate significantly high rate relapse go achieve undetectable HCV RNA 12 week rather 4 week treatment . Extending treatment six month reduces relapse rate considerably . By extend treatment patient infect genotype 3 previously relapse follow 14 week therapy 24 week reduce relapse rate . Thus , anticipate extend treatment 24 48 week fail achieve RVR ( i.e . slow responder ) achieve complete EVR hope prevent relapse treatment . A potential added benefit achieve SVR patient population , many already high risk T2DM , may reduce virally mediate component IR .</detailed_description>
