	<brief_title>Baclofen Hypoxia-induced Periodic Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale study : Periodic ventilation , often call CHEYNE Stokes ventilation , result dysfunction mechanism control breathe . In type ventilation , alternate period hyperventilation apneas and/or hypoventilation replace normal regular pattern breathing . Periodic ventilation occur preferentially sleep . It responsible decrease arterial saturation oxygen sleep fragmentation . There currently consensual treatment non-invasive nocturnal mechanical ventilation often use bring ventilatory pattern back normal . Periodic ventilation occur various condition , frequent cardiac failure . It also occur healthy subject expose hypoxia high altitude . The pathophysiology periodic breathing remain poorly understood . Our hypothesis regard mechanism abnormal ventilatory pattern base comparative physiology . Periodic ventilation indeed usual ventilatory pattern many low vertebrate . Moreover , even isolate VITRO , tadpole brainstem still produce periodic ventilatory rhythm , characterize cluster ventilatory discharge . In model , agonist GABA-B receptor , baclofen , transforms periodic pattern regular one . Of note , baclofen already use treatment human disease , especially spasticity . The hypothesis research project assume periodic ventilation human result neural reconfiguration network command breathing , lead produce ancestral behavior . It also assume baclofen woul reverse phenomenon model tadpole isolated brainstem . The goal project therefore assess effect baclofen hypoxia-induced periodic ventilation healthy subject sleep . This thus pathophysiological study aim demonstrate concept possible clinical trial . This study pathophysiological study , conduct healthy volunteer . Methods : The subject sleep hypoxic condition , level hypoxia similar one find altitude 4000-4500 meter . A altitude , partial pressure oxygen approximately 90-100 mmHg . The hypoxic atmosphere create tent hypoxic generator ( EVEREST Summit Hypoxic Generator , Hypoxic Systems , New York , NY , USA ) . The electroencephalographic electrocardiographic signal movement chest abdomen record portable polysomnograph . The electromyogram chin ELECTRO Oculogram also record . These signal permit identify sleep stage . The subject ware face mask connect pneumotachometer record ventilatory flow . Gas also sample measure end tidal partial pressure CO2 . Protocol : Healthy volunteer enrol give write informed consent . The subject ask medical history physical examination perform . Chest X-ray , electrocardiogram pulmonary function test also perform . The subject ask sleep night record hypoxic condition ( hypoxic session ) . The recording perform either nap afternoon night . A first hypoxic session perform identify subject develop periodic ventilation . Only exhibit periodic ventilation sleep continue study . They prescribe either baclofen placebo ( double blind , randomize ) . The posology progressively increase ( approximately 10 day ) reach 20 mg 3 time day , 3 5 day . A second hypoxic session perform treatment . Then posology decrease 3 day complete wean perform 5 10 day . The protocol repeat , either baclofen placebo ( depend previous run ) third hypoxic session perform . The posology decrease 3 day study consider end subject 2 day complete weaning . The maximum duration study one subject 63 day .</detailed_description>
