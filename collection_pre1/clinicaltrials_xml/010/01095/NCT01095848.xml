	<brief_title>A Phase I Safety Study Cancer Vaccine Treat HLA-A2 Positive Advanced Stage Ovarian , Breast Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer high mortality rate even among obtain complete remission surgery chemotherapy . In prostate cancer , hormonal therapy include androgen ablation may control disease variable lengths time progression invariably occur . There also high rate relapse breast cancer patient four positive axillary lymph node case resect metastatic disease . Immune therapies therapeutic vaccination may prolong remission cancer . Many different therapeutic vaccine evaluate disease phase 1 , 2 even phase 3 trial . Much learn principal apply immune-based therapy specifically type patient may likely mount effective immune response . Cancer vaccine may greatest impact earlier disease course situation minimal residual disease . Most recently overall survival benefit documented prostate cancer patient immunotherapy base vaccine . ImmunoVaccine Technologies Inc. ( IVT ) develop therapeutic vaccine various solid cancer base patented vaccine delivery enhancement platform . The antigen include DPX-0907 identify use innovative antigen discovery platform identify proprietary signature antigens actually present surface tumor cell therefore capable stimulate cellular immune response patient . One peptide antigens expect expressed type tumor include trial . The peptide antigens propose DPX-0907 previously include phase I study different vaccine formulation Duke University . No vaccine-induced autoimmune event report . These encouraging result suggest autoimmune potential cancer-specific peptide antigen limit . IVT 's DepoVax™ ( DPX ) lipid-based formulation design enhance speed , strength duration cellular immune response . This formulation combination tumor target antigen produce favorable safety cellular immune response preclinical study . These parameter study phase I trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients stage III IV ovarian cancer complete course platininbased cytotoxic therapy debulking surgery evidence complete partial response radiological imaging . Patients metastatic ovarian cancer stable disease great 3 month completion firstline therapy . Patients stage IV breast cancer receive least 1 course hormonal cytotoxic therapy metastatic cancer . Patients must cytotoxic therapy stable disease well 3 month great duration . Patients may stable disease still hormonal therapy . Patients prostate cancer fail least 1 course accept hormonal therapy . Specifically prostate cancer patient must castrate testosterone level ( &lt; 50 ng/dl ) 2 PSA value higher previously document baseline least 3 week apart evidence increase measurable disease . These patient may receive previous course cytotoxic chemotherapy although chemotherapy naïve patient deem good candidate refuse cytotoxic therapy eligible . These patient may remain antiandrogen therapy trial . Patients evidence progressive bone metastases acceptable . At least 8 week since previous course investigational biologic therapy ( i.e . cancer vaccine ) include active passive immunotherapy . At least 30 day since localize surgery radiotherapy . At least 30 day since initiation biphosphonate treatment . HLA A2 haplotype . History autoimmune disease , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . Patients remote history ( great five year ) thyroiditis exclude . Presence acute infection require antibiotic within 4 week study entry chronic infection : urinary tract infection , HIV , antigen positive viral hepatitis . Previously resect brain metastasis unless CT MRI scan brain show metastasis within 1 month receive DPX0907 . Concurrent ( within last 5 year ) second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , control bladder cancer . Acute chronic skin disorder interfere subcutaneous injection vaccine subsequent assessment potential skin reaction . Serious intercurrent chronic acute illness , cardiac disease ( NYHA class III IV ) hepatic disease . Steroid therapy immunosuppressive , azathioprine cyclosporin A , unless steroid discontinue 6 week prior study . Allergies component vaccine . Inability gain venous access . Previous splenectomy . Previous lymphadenectomy inguinal region . Pregnant nursing mother . Medical psychological impediment active drug alcohol use might preclude protocol compliance .</criteria>
