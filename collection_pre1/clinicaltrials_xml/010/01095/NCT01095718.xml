	<brief_summary>This study comparison 3 learn technique , Errorless learning , model trial error , relearn IADL Alzheimer patient mild moderately severe dementia . Tailored IADL choose patient ( n=300 ) train individualized session 6 week . This study focus relationship learn technique , IADL memory process , threefold way : 1. determine three learn technique ( EL , MR , TE ) improve ( ) learn instrumental skill different dementia stage use randomize controlled trial ; 2. explain role implicit explicit memory mechanism ( ) learn IADL task ; 3. secondary objective , explore possible drug treatment behavioral intervention interaction effect three learn technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison 3 Learning Methods Improve Independent Activities Daily Living ( IADLs ) Alzheimer Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific background rationale Alzheimer dementia ( AD ) common cause progressive cognitive deterioration alters memory learn degree heavily interferes daily live . Functional autonomy loss key feature AD , follow slow degradation process cognitive function ability perform instrumental activity daily live ( IADL ) , manage finance , food preparation use dish washer . Normally , learn occurs unstructured manner , consist guess occurrence error acquisition ( Trial Error , TE ) . However , abundant evidence reduce error learn ( Errorless Learning , EL ) increase time period recall attempt ( Modeling Spaced Retrieval , MR ) allow even moderate severe Alzheimer Dementia ( AD ) patient ( ) learn instrumental activity daily live ( IADL ) use new route , agenda cassette/radio player . While finding encourage , still fully understand memory mechanism underlie different learn technique crucial improve IADL task ( ) learn remember AD patient . Because acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor memantine may active moderator intervention target memory improvement , complex intervention use behavioral enrichment training explore drug treatment behavioral intervention interaction effect . Description project methodology This study focus relationship learn technique , IADL memory process , threefold way : 1. determine three learn technique ( EL , SR , TE ) improve ( ) learn instrumental skill different dementia stage use randomize controlled trial ; 2. explain role implicit explicit memory mechanism ( ) learn IADL task . ; 3. explore possible drug treatment behavioral intervention interaction effect three learn technique . - Primary outcome : Is ( ) learn effectiveness ( physical performance ) procedure overall maintain autonomy . All intervention individualize training . The learning procedure comparison allow u assess ( ) learn capacity IADL task AD patient accord severity stage mild moderately severe . â€¢ Secondary outcome : Assessing role implicit memory process explicit memory process ( ) learn IADL task . Overall effect intervention patient 's autonomy , cognitive functioning , behavioral disturbance , quality life career burden . Settings : Nursing Homes , Day Care center , Memory Clinics Locations : Nijmegen , The Netherlands Nice Bordeaux agglomeration , France 3 different intervention give individual session participant 's facility . Each intervention 6-week training post assessment 4-week follow-up . Each participant receive one 3 intervention 2 hour twice week individual session . Errorless learning ( EL ) refers use feedforward instruction ( i.e. , ) action prevent learner make mistake . Modeling Spaced Retrieval ( MR ) techniques refers model step increase time interval completion task rehearsal target information patient . Trial Error ( TE ) refers regular unstructured learning consider control condition . A standardized 1-week training develop French Dutch train French Dutch therapist learn technique .</detailed_description>
