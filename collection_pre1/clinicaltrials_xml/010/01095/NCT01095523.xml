	<brief_summary>Background : - Survival rate colorectal cancer depend number factor , include existence tumor outside colon rectum . Patients tumor elsewhere abdomen ( peritoneum ovary ) diagnose , well patient bleed obstruction diagnose , high risk cancer recurrence even surgery treatment . - If additional tumor discover early remove still small ( often show scan ) , survival rate may improve . In addition , patient receive heat chemotherapy solution deliver directly abdomen often well treatment outcomes regardless whether additional tumor find . Further research help determine usefulness treatment improve outcomes patient colorectal cancer . Objectives : - To determine whether patient surgery colorectal cancer improve outcomes receive additional surgery combine direct chemotherapy , compare receive current standard care . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age surgery colorectal cancer within past 14 month , consider high risk cancer recurrence , whose current imaging scan show sign additional tumor . Design : - Participants divide two treatment group : surgery group standard care group . - Participants surgery less 11 month ago enrol 3-month lead-in phase receive standard follow-up care , include lab , scan , physical examination , randomize treatment group 11 14 month surgery . Participants surgery 11 14 month ago randomize time enrollment . - Participants surgery group follow procedure within 2 week randomization : - Abdominal surgery surgeon look remove tumor take biopsy check cancer cell - Heated chemotherapy , three chemotherapy drug administer directly abdomen - In-patient recovery follow-up visit begin 3 6 week discharge . - Participants standard care group standard follow-up schedule high-risk colorectal cancer patient : - Clinic evaluation every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year yearly thereafter ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Trial Evaluating Mandatory Second Look Surgery With HIPEC CRS vs. Standard Care Subjects High Risk Developing Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC ) colorectal cancer ( CRC ) treat chemotherapy alone result median survival 5 13 month . .-Approximately , 55 % high risk patient ( Patients present synchronous PC , ovarian metastasis perforate primary , emergency presentation bleed obstruct lesion ) develop PC . - Early PC undetectable conventional imaging . - Cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) early PC CRC result median survival 48-63 month 5 year survival 51 % . - This study prospective randomize trial design answer question whether mandatory second look surgery ( MSLS ) CRS HIPEC prolong overall survival compare standard care . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective : - To compare overall survival patient high risk develop PC CRC undergo M SLS + HIPEC CRS ( applicable ) vs. similar patient receive standard care . Secondary Objectives : - To determine recurrence-free survival arm . - To investigate selection criterion patient might benefit strategy MSLS CRS + HIPEC . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients undergone curative resection f CRC high risk recurrence - Patients show evidence disease time enrollment - Patients ECOG less equal 0-2 suitable candidate laparotomy , HIPEC CRS . DESIGN : - High risk CRC patient develop PC underwent curative surgery subsequently receive standard care remain NED 12 month primary surgery randomize MSLS/CRS/HIPEC continue standard care . - HIPEC do use Oxaliplatin/5-FU/Leucovorin . - Up 100 patient enrol allow 35 evaluable patient arm ; accrual expect last 5 year .</detailed_description>
