	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find lymph node surgery use dye call indocyanine green ( IC-Green ) . Objectives : 1 . To determine feasibility use nonradioactive optical image technique indocyanine green ( ICG ) fluorescent contrast agent identify axillary lymph node . 2 . To determine feasibility use nonradioactive optical image technique ICG fluorescent contrast agent characterize lymphatic architecture function woman breast cancer schedule axillary node dissection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IC-Green Injections : If find eligible take part study , member study staff give 6-16 injection IC-Green needle hand , arm , breast . The study doctor discus number injection receive detail . The injection give anesthesia . These IC-Green injection allow researcher see flow liquid body image locate lymph node remove standard care surgery . After IC-Green injection give , image procedure begin . Researchers use experimental camera shin special red light onto skin cause IC-Green glow image take . The red light like red light grocery store scanner . The imaging procedure take 1 hour complete . Before IC-Green injection imaging , member research staff monitor record vital sign ( blood pressure , breathe rate , heart rate , temperature ) . After IC-Green injection , study staff member closely monitor injection site possible side effect every 15 minute first hour , every 30 minute second hour . A study staff member call next day ask take temperature . This phone call last 5 minute . Follow-Up Evaluation : If spend night hospital surgery , study staff member visit follow-up day surgery . At visit , temperature record ask feeling side effect . The visit last 10 minute . If spend night hospital surgery , contact phone day surgery . You ask question describe , well temperature . The phone call last 10 minute . Length Study : After image take , follow-up evaluation complete , participation study . This investigational study . IC-Green FDA approve commercially available map heart , liver , eye function . The use IC-Green mapping lymph node breast cancer patient investigational . The experimental camera , image take , use research purpose use manage treatment . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
