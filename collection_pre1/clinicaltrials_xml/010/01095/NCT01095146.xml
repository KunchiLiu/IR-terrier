	<detailed_description>Abbreviations : - ANC : - Absolute neutrophil count DIC : - Disseminated intra-vascular coagulation HLH : - Hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis IAHS : - Infection associate hemophagocytic syndrome MAS : - Macrophage activation syndrome MODS : - Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome NK cell : - Natural Killer cell ReHLH : - reactive HLH SoJIA : - Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis SLE : - Systemic lupu erythematosus WBC : - white blood cell count Background Introduction : - The first appearance literature description patient later know macrophage activation syndrome ( MAS ) probably description SoJIA patient fulminant course hepatic failure Boone et al1 coagulopathy Silverman et al2 . However term `` macrophage activation syndrome '' ( Syndromes inappropriate macrophage activation childhood ) first use medical literature French pediatrician hemat-oncologists3-5 . The credit wrongly attribute Stephen et al , actually first use term `` rheumatology '' literature description 4 SoJIA patient complication6 . It evident quote literature MAS time 's intial recognition symptom complex complication rheumatic illness , universally fatal illness . Since understand 's pathology 's treatment grown considerably . The main defect MAS deficient NK cell activity . Hence trigger stimulate immune system lead unchecked CD8+ T cell proliferation persist even elimination trigger . These T cell secrete IFN-gamma lead macrophage overstimulation . This turn activate cytokine storm production ( TNF , IL 1 IL 6 ) phagocytosis marrow element marcophages , ultimately lead MODS7 . MAS usually occur set untreated inadequately control rheumatic disease severe systemic inflammation . The diagnosis difficult particularly background therefore high clinical suspicion paramount . Among many rheumatic disease MAS predominantly describe associated SoJIA . The next common rheumatic illness describe SLE . The hallmarks complication Bone marrow suppression , DIC abnormal bleeding , encephalopathy/ seizure , hepatitis . MAS increase recognize similarity Class II histiocytic disorder hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) . In recent classification disorder Class II disorder subdivide primary ( due genetic defect ) , secondary ( due infection , malignancy , immunodeficiency ) reactive ( due rheumatic disease ) 8 . The last category alludes MAS . Rationale justification : -The HLH disorder diagnose use HLH criterion . However point Kelly et al9 Ravelli et al10 use criterion diagnose patient MAS ( i.e . Reactive HLH ) would lead unacceptable loss sensitivity significant delay . Some component HLH criterion Soluble NK cell activity , CD-25 value normal age , molecular diagnosis consistent HLH neither practical feasible clinical setting majority rheumatology patient . Ravelli et al come different set criterion patient MAS base data patient report literature10 . A comparison 2 criterion retrospective longitudinal study11 ( albeit small sample size ) show Ravelli et al criterion much sensitive enabled patient diagnose much early HLH-2004 criterion use . In SoJIA uncontrolled rheumatic disease patient liable high WBC count high platelet count . Bone marrow suppression one pathognomic feature MAS would pick late absolute cut value utilize . Kelly et al use argument review suggest MAS/ReHLH , trend change laboratory parameter would useful absolute cut offs . Hence propose new candidate criterion base trend laboratory parameter would probably able predict MAS earlier absolute cut offs laboratory parameters.MAS undergone name change ( Reactive HLH ) image change ( universally terminal illness dread treatable complication ) . Hence need recognition early diagnosis important today ever . In era potent novel immuno-modulatory medication , sensitive criterion would pick patient prone develop MAS process develop MAS would give u edge finally help u rein terrify disease .</detailed_description>
