	<brief_summary>Weight loss maintenance continue problematic individual overweight obese . State-of-the-art treatment generally involve behavioral weight loss clinic emphasize nutrition , physical activity , lifestyle change deliver face-to-face health educator small group participant . This delivery system time consuming , expensive , present numerous barrier participant . We develop phone base delivery system eliminate many barrier substitute group conference call clinic deliver weight loss material product directly participant . Hypothesis 1 : We expect equivalent weight loss baseline phone clinic group define equivalence great 4 kg difference group base pilot data potential clinical significance . Hypothesis 2 : During weight maintenance likely participant experience weight re-gain . We expect phone clinic group re-gain similar amount weight weight group 18 month significantly less baseline weight . Hypothesis 3 : We complete cost analysis determine delivery method economical . Specifically , expect phone delivery system cost effective in-person clinic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phone Versus Clinical Approach Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss maintenance continue problematic individual overweight obese . State-of-the-art treatment deliver face-to-face care provider small group participant time consuming , expensive , present numerous barrier participant travel , conflict work home , need child care , loss anonymity , others well care provider office space , meeting room , inventory , etc . A pilot study phone base delivery system versus traditional clinic complete difference weight loss . The phone approach may eliminate many barrier traditional clinic substitute conference call clinic deliver weight loss material product directly participant . In fashion , care provider participant reside location receive information conference phone call provide clinic , receive educational material , weight management product , etc . air ground transportation . This propose investigation randomize , equivalency trial test effectiveness phone base weight management program compare traditional face-to-face clinic program weight loss weight maintenance . It expect 6 month participant phone clinic group show equivalent weight loss weight loss least 10 % low baseline . During weight maintenance weight gain may occur . However , expect phone clinic group gain similar amount weight weight group 18 month significantly less baseline weight . A formal cost analysis use determine difference phone clinic approach extensive process analysis use collect qualitative quantitative data assess well program implement originally design , challenge barrier effective implementation , initial continual use program specify activity , quality assurance measure , etc . Relevance : If successful , phone approach may eliminate many barrier inherent traditional face-to-face clinic , may less expensive , would potentially open weight management individual access phone . We believe likelihood translation research public sector would seem reasonable promising .</detailed_description>
