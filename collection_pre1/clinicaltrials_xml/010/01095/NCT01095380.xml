	<brief_summary>Background : Body weight support ( BWS ) locomotor train improves overground walk ability individual motor-incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . While various approach available locomotor training , consensus regard optimal . The purpose ongoing investigation compare outcomes associate different training approach . Subjects Methods : Subjects chronic motor-incomplete SCI complete train initial final testing . Subjects randomly assign 1 4 different BWS assisted-stepping group , include : 1 ) treadmill train manual assistance ( TM ) , 2 ) treadmill train stimulation ( TS ) , 3 ) overground train stimulation ( OG ) , 4 ) treadmill train robotic assistance ( LR ) . Prior follow participation investigator assess : - Walking-related outcome measure : overground walk speed , train speed , step length step symmetry . - Spinal cord reflex activity - Electromyographic ( EMG ) associate walk Hypotheses : In individual incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) : 1 . A 12-week period body weight support treadmill train TS produce improvement walk function significantly great produce training TM , OG , LR . 2 . TS training associate great change spinal reflex activity observe subject train manual assistance non-assisted stepping . Changes spinal reflex activation activity closely resemble observe non-disabled ( ND ) individual . 3 . Following participation walk regimen , EMG activity observe walk group robust , consistent well coordinate EMG measure obtain prior training .</brief_summary>
