	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine film prevent adhesion improve area distribution contrast dye ( representative chemotherapy ) abdominal cavity ( belly ) woman undergone surgery ovarian cancer compare patient adhesion barrier sheet place belly . It believe film , Seprafilm™ , reduce adhesion ( scar tissue tissue organ ) abdominal cavity follow surgery . Adhesions limit distribution chemotherapy agent place abdomen treat ovarian cancer . Thirty subject receive adhesion barrier sheet thirty . To determine sheet prevent adhesion , subject dye inserted abdomen X-rays abdomen look distribution dye two group . Hypothesis : Null hypothesis : There difference area distribution intraperitoneal dye Seprafilm ™ vs. Seprafilm™ group . Alternative hypothesis : Seprafilm™ reduce adhesion formation large area distribution intraperitoneal dye Seprafilm™ group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seprafilm™ Prevention Intraperitoneal Adhesions Improved Delivery Therapy Women Undergoing Staging Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recommended treatment epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) include optimal surgical debulking &lt; 1 cm residual disease , follow combination intraperitoneal ( IP ) intravenous ( IV ) chemotherapy least 6 cycle . Serous EOC know spread transperitoneally often diffusely disseminate within peritoneal cavity . It believe IP therapy via direct contact effective treat small intraperitoneal implant . What known whether IP therapy evenly distribute individual degree adhesion formation scar tissue prevents even distribution chemotherapy within belly , potentially impact efficacy . Few study address question adhesion intraperitoneal therapy general , study specifically ovarian cancer utilize current guideline . Efficacy proven IP/IV therapy IV alone range survival within IP group may secondary `` tumor biology , '' patient selection ( i.e. , disease truly &gt; 1 cm ) lack of/poor distribution IP drug secondary adhesion . Any product could show decrease adhesion increase area distribution IP therapy would prove major advantage . The majority scar adhesion take place first 7 day surgical procedure . And first IP IV chemotherapy usually commence 7-21 day surgery . Therefore , first treatment provide opportunity ass intraperitoneal adhesion . To assess adhesion , inject radiopaque dye ( iohexol ) via IP port , rotate patient per standard practice IP therapy distribute inject liquid , take 3 view ( simple X-rays ) abdomen . The area distribution dye ( represent distribution IP chemotherapy ) compare two group subject ( Seprafilm™ vs. Seprafilm™ ) .</detailed_description>
