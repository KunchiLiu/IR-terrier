	<brief_title>Evaluating Heterologous-Insert Prime-Boost HIV Vaccine Regimens HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One approach develop preventive HIV vaccine include use prime-boost vaccine strategy . This type strategy involve two vaccine , give sequentially different time point . The goal stimulate different part immune system enhance body 's overall immune response HIV . In study , participant receive two HIV vaccine 3 month apart . Heterologous-insert prime-boost vaccine regimen , use gene different HIV-1 subtypes , may effective traditional homologous insert prime-boost vaccine regimens elicit immune response direct epitope highly prevalent , possibly lead effective immune system response vaccine . The purpose study assess safety immunogenicity heterologous-insert prime-boost HIV vaccine regimen use insert different HIV-1 subtypes different adenovirus vector . This study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected people . Participants randomly assign one five study group : - Group 1 receive recombinant adenovirus serotype 35 ( rAd35 ) Env A vaccine baseline recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 ( rAd5 ) Env A vaccine Month 3 . - Group 2 receive rAd35 Env A vaccine baseline rAd5 Env B vaccine Month 3 . - Group 3 receive rAd35 Env A vaccine baseline Month 3 . - Group 4 receive rAd5 Env A vaccine baseline Month 3 . - Group 5 receive rAd5 Env A vaccine baseline rAd5 Env B vaccine Month 3 . All vaccine inject upper arm . At vaccination study visit , participant undergo physical exam , medical medication history review , blood urine collection , questionnaire . Participants receive counsel HIV risk reduction pregnancy prevention . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic least 30 minute observation monitor side effect . For 3 day vaccination , participant record temperature side effect symptom log . In addition vaccine study visit , study visit occur Week 2 , two week Month 3 visit , Months 4 , 6 , 9 , time various study procedure repeat . Participants contact study researcher year 5 year follow-up safety monitoring . Safety monitoring involve visit clinic except confirmatory HIV test need . Questions ass health adverse event . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability , well ability , heterologous-insert prime-boost vaccine regimen use env insert different HIV-1 clade increase T-cell response . In addition , study evaluate effectiveness heterologous-insert prime-boost vector prime-boost vaccine regimen increase T-cell response . The study also compare degree polyfunctionality insert specific T cell vaccination within heterologous homologous vector vaccine regimen .</detailed_description>
