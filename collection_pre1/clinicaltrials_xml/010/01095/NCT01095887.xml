	<brief_title>Eculizumab Prevent Antibody-mediated Rejection ABO Blood Group Incompatible Living Donor Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation consider best therapy patient end-stage renal disease . In instance , suitable living kidney donor ABO blood group incompatible . This usually present barrier successful transplantation recipient circulate serum antibody bind incompatible blood group bind damage kidney allograft early transplantation . Fortunately , past decade , others develop protocol involve pretransplant removal anti-blood group antibodies use multiple plasmapheresis treatment allow successful transplantation ABOi LDKTx . Thus , therapy enables patient receive live donor advantage rather wait &gt; 5 year decease donor kidney .</detailed_description>
