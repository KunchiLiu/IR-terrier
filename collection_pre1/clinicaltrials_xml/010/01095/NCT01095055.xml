	<brief_summary>This open label phase I study , assess safety novel malaria vaccine , AdCh63 AMA1 , simian adenovirus encode Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigen , Apical Membrane Antigen -1 . All volunteer recruit healthy adult . They prim various dos AdCh63 AMA1 administer intramuscularly . Some volunteer receive booster vaccination MVA AMA1 administer via intramuscular route . Safety data collect eight regimen . Secondary aim study assess immune response generate regime .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study AdCh63 AMA1 Alone With MVA AMA1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMA1 type I integral membrane protein . It produce mature P. falciparum schizonts infect erythrocyte AMA1 become leading candidate vaccine antigen . This base several fact , notably several field study association find antibody ectodomain AMA1 protection clinical malaria . Also , Gambia , presence antibody AMA1 MSP-1 show enhance clearance chloroquine resistant parasites vivo . There number trial currently ongoing Oxford aim examine simian adenovirus delivery vehicle liver blood stage malaria antigens insert . AdCh63 currently use MSP-1 insert , blood stage antigen , phase I dose escalation clinical trial Oxford ( VAC037 / GTAC 166 ) . The trial design include AdCh63 MSP-1 administer alone MVA MSP-1 part heterologous prime boost schedule , sporozoite challenge 3 volunteer higher dose group . At recent interim analysis , AdCh63 MSP-1 demonstrate excellent safety profile . Also , AdCh63 currently use ME-TRAP insert , liver stage antigen phase I dose escalation clinical trial Oxford , ( VAC033 / GTAC133 ) phase I/IIa trial sporozoite challenge ( MAL034 / OXREC : 09/H064/9 ) . AdCh63 ME-TRAP administer alone MVA ME-TRAP part heterologous prime boost schedule various dos excellent safety immunogenicity 87 volunteer time interim analysis .</detailed_description>
