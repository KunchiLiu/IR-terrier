	<brief_summary>The main purpose project establish additional value eccentric versus concentric exercise optimize muscle function patient severe COPD . With pilot project investigator expect eccentric endurance training protocol adapt severe COPD patient lead gain muscle strength , primary outcome , cellular adaptation ( muscle morphology oxidative capacity , mitochondrial respiratory capacity ) compare concentric training approach . This information essential investigator want design power randomize clinical trial allow assess effectiveness novel rehabilitation approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eccentric Exercise Training Novel Rehabilitation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major respiratory illness preventable treatable . Dyspnea important symptom COPD patient experience major impact daily live . While COPD characterize spectrum disease severity , patient experience poor exercise intolerance attributable ventilatory limitation well peripheral muscle fatigue , ultimately lead severe disability . Endurance exercise important component pulmonary rehabilitation aim prevent decline functional capacity . The effect pulmonary rehabilitation largely attributable exercise training component involve concentric muscle contraction , traditionally trough dynamic , large muscle exercise cycle ergometer treadmill . However , many patient unable partake benefit rehabilitation locomotor muscle weakness severe ventilatory limitation prevent exercise intensity sufficient provoke improvement cardioventilatory skeletal muscle function . Eccentric exercise know unique physiologically fundamental characteristic : low metabolic demand power output great muscle gain compare concentric exercise . For reason , eccentric endurance training propose novel adjunctive rehabilitative countermeasure certain chronic disease ( coronary disease COPD ) play important role patient advanced disease .</detailed_description>
