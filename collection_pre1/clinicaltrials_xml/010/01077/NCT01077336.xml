	<brief_summary>Susceptibility test commonly employ patient bacterial infection order guide rational use antibiotic ; however , use antifungal susceptibility test limited due lack availability , cost , delay receive result . The goal antifungal susceptibility test mirror antibacterial susceptibility testing : predict clinical response failure . Additionally , susceptibility report use guide physician transition patient parenteral oral antifungal agent . Currently , unknown whether antifungal susceptibility test impact treatment decision hospital routinely perform Candida susceptibility test . The purpose study evaluate change antifungal treatment base vitro susceptibility report decision affect mortality , recurrence infection , length hospital stay candidemia patient .</brief_summary>
