	<brief_summary>Hospitalized patient often move room hospital location , particularly image facility . For patient traumatic brain injury , movement may raise risk secondary brain injury . The purpose study monitor brain injured patient transport measure result change intracranial pressure . This allow documentation frequency secondary injury help understanding cause .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Transport Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary insult , hypoxia hypotension , may worsen brain injury . We hypothesize secondary brain insult may occur frequently in-hospital transport patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . We additionally hypothesize automate data collection device use transport could reliably document frequency event help u understand cause . During transport patient TBI , intracranial pressure arterial blood pressure continuously record monitor save later analysis . Additional continuous measurement pulse oximetry , end-tidal carbon dioxide , mechanical ventilation setting make . The study identify patient risk secondary insult , etiology insult , assist development road map prevent future incident .</detailed_description>
