	<brief_summary>Intra- abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) cause organ dysfunction critically ill patient . IAH develop due abdominal lesion ( primary IAH ) extra-abdominal process ( secondary IAH ) . Secondary IAH arises due decrease abdominal wall compliance gut edema cause capillary leak excessive fluid resuscitation . Decreasing intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) use decompressieve laparotomy show improve organ dysfunction . However , laparotomy generally avoid patient secondary IAH due risk abdominal complication . Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) one first pronounce organ failure associate IAH many patient AKI ICU require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . Fluid removal use continuous RRT ( CRRT ) demonstrate decrease IAP small series select patient . The aim study evaluate whether fluid removal use CVVH patient IAH , fluid overload AKI feasible whether beneficial effect organ dysfunction ( compare CVVH without net fluid removal ) .</brief_summary>
