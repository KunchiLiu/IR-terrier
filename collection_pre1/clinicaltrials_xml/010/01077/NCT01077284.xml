	<brief_title>Febuxostat Versus Allopurinol Placebo Patients With Hyperuricosuria Calcium Oxalate Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nephrolithiasis , also call kidney stone disease , occur patient genetic susceptibility may broad spectrum metabolic disorder comorbid condition ( example obesity diabetes ) . These renal stone develop result supersaturation . Calcium oxalate ( CaOx ) common type stone . Reducing urinary excretion uric acid establish approach treatment CaOx kidney stone . The objective study evaluate treatment febuxostat compare allopurinol placebo reduction 24-hour urine uric acid ( uUA ) excretion level hyperuricosuric patient recent history renal stone presence least one CaOx stone large equal 3 mm see Multidetector Computed Tomographic Angiography ( MDCT ) . Participants study require make 4 office visit provide 3 urine sample undergo 2 MDCT scan ( type x-ray ) kidney .</detailed_description>
