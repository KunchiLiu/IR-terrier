	<brief_title>Cytomegalovirus - Immunoprophylactic Adoptive Cellular Therapy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As herpes virus , CMV infection think result frequently reactivation latent virus . Transmission virus also occur donor marrow infusion allogeneic red cell , leukocyte platelet transfusion . In allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell ( bone marrow ) transplant patient CMV seropositive receive transplant donor CMV seropositive , CMV frequently reactivate disease result progression infection major cause infectious morbidity mortality . CMV infection consequence immunosuppression patient receive may also reflect delay immune reconstitution patient follow transplant . Existing evidence suggest adoptive cellular therapy effective approach treat viral reactivation follow allo HSCT , minimal risk induce GVHD . The major advantage patient likely avoidance extend period therapy antiviral medication significant associated morbidity , sometimes require inpatient care . A proof efficacy sibling donor set would strengthen case extend therapy unrelated donor setting , potential risk benefit great . From pharmacoeconomic viewpoint , avoidance cost associate treatment episode could offset cost adoptive cellular therapy . A number issue remain unresolved . These include relative contribution transfer CD4+ CD8+ T cell population ( may direct relevance best approach selection ) , issue whether adoptive cellular therapy improve outcome randomise setting , equally importantly , issue whether immunotherapy deliver outside set academic institution multicentre basis . These consideration emphasise importance undertaking randomise phase III study prophylactic adoptive cellular therapy CMV follow T cell deplete allogeneic HSCT sibling donor ( CMV~IMPACT ) . There multiple method T cell depletion available , difference likely effect immune reconstitution . In order avoid confound influence study restrict patient receive alemtuzumab-containing conditioning protocol . In summary , study multicentre , prospective , control , open-label 3 arm randomize study compare 'best-available ' standard anti-viral monitoring therapy alone , 'best available'anti-viral monitoring therapy plus prophylactic adoptive cellular therapy ( ACT ) cell select either Gamma Catch Multimer Selection technique . Patients randomise : A . Standard best available antiviral drug therapy alone B. Immunoprophylactic ( Day 27 ) ACT prepare use Gamma Catch Selection combination standard best available antiviral drug therapy C. Immunoprophylactic ( Day 27 ) ACT prepare use Multimer Selection combination standard best available antiviral drug therapy The study test hypothesis CMV-specific ACT base upon prescribed T-cell dose/kg recipient body weight , augment impair CMV immune function post-transplant reduce number recurrent reactivations patient follow primary reactivation event ( thereby reduce requirement antiviral drug therapy ) without cause increase GVHD . Individual group compare duration antiviral therapy number reactivation episode , plus GVHD incidence . Similar analysis perform adoptive cellular therapy versus therapy ( i.e . ( B+C ) versus A )</detailed_description>
