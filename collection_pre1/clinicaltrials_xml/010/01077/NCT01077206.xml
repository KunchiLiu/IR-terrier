Abstract Background : Experimental evidence indicate benefit simvastatin treatment subarachnoid haemorrhage . Simvastatin also potent agent reduce low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . However , clinical data available compare efficacy different dosage regimen ( specifically , whether high-dose regimen effective normal-dosage regimen ) conduct relate cost-effectiveness analysis , even though biochemical action related neuroprotective mechanism think dosage-related . This gap knowledge use statins interpret trial result important , motivated investigator conduct study . Objective : We hypothesize eighty milligram simvastatin daily ( high dose ) three week initiate within 96 hour ictus reduce incidence delay ischaemic deficit follow subarachnoid haemorrhage compare 40mg simvastatin daily ( normal dose ) , lead improvement clinical outcome thus cost-effectiveness . Methods : The study design randomise control double-blinded clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01077206 ) . Two hundred forty aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage patient ( present within 96 hour ictus ) six neurosurgical centre recruit three year . Primary outcome measure Presence delay ischaemic deficit ( DIDs ) . Secondary outcome measure include Modified Rankin Disability Score ( mRS ) three month ( favourable 0-2 ) Cost-Effectiveness Analysis term overall direct cost per patient incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) . Expected outcome : This first study clarify whether high-dose simvastatin well normal-dose simvastatin patient acute aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage term neurological outcomes cost-effectiveness .

Early aneurysm occlusion , expert endovascular neurosurgery microsurgery , use oral nimodipine neuro-intensive care standard care.1-3 Nevertheless , aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage still associate mortality one month half patient , half leave disability . Experimental evidence indicate benefit simvastatin treatment subarachnoid haemorrhage.4-15 Simvastatin also potent reduce LDL , proven safety profile . Three randomise placebo-controlled pilot trial support use statin ( two 80mg simvastatin one 40mg pravastatin ) treatment aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.17-19 A systemic review suggest simvastatin may also reduce delayed cerebral ischaemia aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage,20 another meta-analysis recommend routine use statin care patient aneurysmal SAH.21 Finally , ongoing multicentre , placebo-controlled phase III trial assess clinical benefit treatment 40mg simvastatin daily [ http : //www.stashtrial.com/home.html ] . However , clinical data available compare efficacy different dosage regimen ( specifically , whether high-dose regimen effective normal-dosage regimen ) conduct relate cost-effectiveness analysis , even though biochemical action related neuroprotective mechanism think dosage-related . This gap knowledge use statins interpret trial result important , motivated investigator conduct study . Study Goal Objective The objective study determine whether high dose simvastatin aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage superior normal dose term clinical outcome cost-effectiveness . We hypothesize eighty milligram simvastatin daily ( high dose ) three week initiate within 96 hour ictus reduce incidence delay ischaemic deficit follow subarachnoid haemorrhage compare 40mg simvastatin daily ( normal dose ) , lead improvement clinical outcome thus cost-effectiveness . Study Design The study design multicentre randomise control double-blinded ( participant outcome assessor ) clinical trial . Methodology Subjects Inclusion criterion : 1 . Patients age 18-70 year admit neurosurgeon high index suspicion spontaneous aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage convince CT scan finding . 2 . Any clinical grade , provide reasonable prospect survival . 3 . The delay time present ictus randomisation initiation trial medication exceed 96 hour . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Unsalvageable patient : fix dilate pupil resuscitation , and/or devastate scan prelude definitive therapy . 2 . Previous statin therapy . 3 . Current course Warfarin-type drug . 4 . Pregnancy . 5 . Known renal hepatic impairment . 6 . Suspected known additional disease process threaten life expectancy ( e.g . malignancy ) . 7 . Known strong suspicion drug abuse alcoholism , likelihood amendable either 3-month follow . 8 . Current course amiodarone , verapamil potent CYP3A4 inhibitor . Outcome measure follow-up : Primary outcome measure : 1 . Presence delay ischaemic deficit ( DIDs ) : fall two point modify Glasgow Coma Scale , new focal neurological deficit last 2 hour , new cerebral infarction CT perfusion evidence cerebral ischaemia unrelated surgery/embolisation , rebleed , hydrocephalus , infection , electrolyte metabolic disturbance . Secondary outcome measure : 2 . Modified Rankin Disability Score ( mRS ) three month ( favourable 0-2 ) . 3 . Cost-effective analysis term overall direct cost per patient incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) high-dose group versus normal-dose group , i.e. , cost difference per patient divide difference percentage ( ) favourable outcome ( b ) delay cerebral ischaemia . Sensitivity analyse ICER carry use percentage favourable outcome delay cerebral ischaemia . Study description Ethical approval obtain respective institutional review board . The study adhere international quality standard provide Good Clinical Practice guideline . After informed consent patient next kin , subject randomise receive 80mg simvastatin ( two tablet 40mg ) 40mg simvastatin ( one tablet 40mg one placebo tablet ) per day 21 day orally nasogastric tube . Randomisation Once eligibility criterion fulfil , permuted-block randomisation carry use computer system allocation list random order generate statistician related project team protect blind integrity study . The study drug assignment conceal within seal envelope . These envelope open site study investigator involve clinical management recruit patient . The allocation ratio 1:1 . Both clinical team ( medical nursing ) patient blind study drug allocation . Sample size Assuming high-dose group 35 % delayed cerebral ischaemia risk 20 % absolute reduction delay cerebral ischaemia compare standard dose group 55 % delayed cerebral ischaemia , total 212 patient require ( 80 % power 2-sided alpha=0.05 ) . However , assume 10 % loss follow , 236 patient need recruit . The study design expectation 30 patient Â¬being recruit four centre per year22-23 ; total 240 patient thus expect recruit 24 month period . Because delay start patient recruitment centre , two extra centre ( total six ) initiate patient recruitment . Trial status Patient recruitment complete March 2013 , last recruited patient due final outcome assessment June 2013 . Data archiving , data analysis dissemination study result take place early 2014 . Safety Considerations Drug-related morbidity include rhabdomyolysis hepatitis rare . In two report pilot study , one patient withdraw due elevate liver parenchymal enzyme , reverse cessation medication . Plasma creatinine phosphokinase ( CPK ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) monitor early sign hepatitis myositis every 7 day clinical suspicion . Administration study drug cease ALT/AST three time normal level &gt; 180U/L CPK &gt; 1,000U/L . Cholesterol level also monitor weekly . Follow-Up In addition laboratory test mention , patient follow daily clinical team adverse event acute admission weekly first three week discharge . A three-month clinical visit arrange outcome assessment possible adverse event . A contact number available enrolled patient query suspect adverse event report . Data Management Statistical Analysis Data collect handwritten form archive password-protected electronic database . We aim perform intention-to-treat analysis use two-sided probability , P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Proportions ( ) DCI ( b ) favourable outcome compare chi-square statistic .
