	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare effect lower intermittent dos letrozole standard letrozole therapy estrogen suppression postmenopausal woman high risk develop breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Comparison effect lower intermittent dos letrozole standard therapy sign symptom estrogen deficiency , include menopausal symptom , serum lipid profile , serum marker bone turnover . II . Comparison effect lower intermittent dos letrozole standard therapy nuclear chromatin abnormality breast epithelial cell collect random periareolar fine needle aspiration ( RPFNA ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine prevalence breast cancer stem cell fine needle breast aspirate explore potential intervention effect prevalence breast cancer stem cell . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive 2.5 mg letrozole orally ( PO ) thrice weekly 6 month . ARM II : Patients receive 1.0 mg letrozole PO thrice weekly 6 month . ARM III : Patients receive 0.25 mg letrozole PO thrice weekly 6 month . ARM IV : Patients receive 2.5 mg letrozole PO daily 6 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 30 .</detailed_description>
