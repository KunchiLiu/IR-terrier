	<brief_summary>A consistent find many study patient operable esophageal gastro-esophageal junction ( GEJ ) cancer response preoperative therapy , particularly absence residual disease surgical specimen , indicator well disease-free overall survival . Therefore investigator trial investigator evaluate pathologic response panitumumab combination neoadjuvant chemoradiation first line treatment operable adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma esophagus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoradiation Panitumumab Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , non-randomized trial . Eligible subject treat panitumumab plus carboplatin , paclitaxel radiotherapy follow surgical resection esophagus . Panitumumab administration schedule : Panitumumab administer 60-minute ± 15 minute IV infusion , prior administration chemotherapy dose 6 mg/kg day 1 , 15 29 . If first infusion well tolerate ( without serious infusion relate reaction ) subsequent infusion may administer 30 minute ± 10 minute . Chemotherapy regimen : Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 Carboplatin AUC = 2 give intravenous infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 29 . Both drug infuse one hour . Radiotherapy treatment : A total dose 41.4 Gy give 23 fraction 1.8 Gy , 5 fraction per week , start first day first cycle chemotherapy . All patient radiate external beam radiation , use 3-D conformal radiation technique . Surgery : Surgery perform preferably within 6 week completion chemoradiation panitumumab . For carcinomas distal tracheal bifurcation proximal gastro-esophageal junction , transthoracic approach prefer . For distal tumor involve gastro-esophageal junction transhiatal esophageal resection prefer . A wide local excision include N1 lymph node carry technique include standard excision lymph node around coeliac axis . The continuity digestive tract restore gastric tube reconstruction colonic interposition procedure anastomosis neck .</detailed_description>
