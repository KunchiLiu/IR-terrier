	<detailed_description>Overweight obese adult likely hypertension risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Evidence-based medication lifestyle strategy exist reduce CVD risk , little known comparative effectiveness cost-effectiveness strategy best integrate routine health care . We previously demonstrate Web-based pharmacist medication management intervention cost-effectively improve HTN control ( e-BP : Electronic Communication Home Blood Pressure Monitoring ; R01 HL075263 , B . Green , PI ) . Web-based pharmacy care lead lifestyle behavior change weight loss . However patient lose small amount weight ( 2 kg ) likely control BP ( p=.008 ) , regardless study group assignment . We propose use Health Information Technology system ( HIT ) identify asymptomatic patient moderate risk CVD invite participate theory-based behavioral intervention use Chronic Care Model plan foundation . Specific Aims Aim # 1 : We hypothesize use electronic database alone , identify asymptomatic overweight obese patient , uncontrolled BP , moderate risk CVD might benefit behavioral intervention . Aim # 2 : We hypothesize dietitian-delivered behavioral intervention , use patient share EMR e-communications , integrate routine healthcare result improve control modifiable CVD risk . To test hypothesis measure : Primary outcome : 1 . The proportion patient agree participate complete intervention . 2 . The change mean systolic diastolic BP weight ( kg ) , weight loss 4 kg , change Framingham risk score . Secondary outcome : 1 . Patient satisfaction intervention , effect health relate quality life ( HrQOL ) cost deliver intervention . Using information result e-BP trial plan full scale , multi-site ( 2-3 health institution comprehensive EMR 's different geographic patient population ) multi-factorial randomize trialâ€”to test comparative effectiveness different strategy improve control modifiable CVD risk .</detailed_description>
