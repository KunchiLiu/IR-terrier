	<brief_title>A Retrospective Cohort Study Acute Pancreatitis Relation Use Exenatide Other Antidiabetic Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Limitations study : The result provide interpreted light follow limitation : - Misclassification acute pancreatitis may distort estimate absolute relative IRs . In case degree misclassification non-differential respect exposure cohort , likely case administrative data , RR would bias toward null value , although magnitude bias depend amount misclassification . - Lack information important potential confounders , like obesity alcohol use , another limitation present analysis . Although adjusted propensity score exenatide initiation , include large number factor derive claim data , likely present estimate somewhat inaccurate due residual confounding . - Our definition current use time-on-drug analysis , extend 31 day past nominal end last dispensing cohort-defining drug , may long duration thus misclassify exposure relevant etiologic period . - Additionally , analyse assume pharmacy submit claim medication patient receive consume medication . While possible misclassification exposure non-adherence medication dispense occurred , prior work show pharmacy claim valid ascertain medication exposure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Exenatide Initiators : The date first dispense exenatide potential cohort member might qualify 1 June 2005 , late date 31 December 2007 . We note first initiation exenatide , also note subsequent initiation antidiabetic drug . Eligible exenatide initiator include exenatide initiator cohort first eligible dispense follow least 9 month continuous health plan enrollment . Other Antidiabetic Drug Initiators : The date first dispense antidiabetic drug exenatide potential cohort member might qualify 1 June 2005 , late date 31 December 2007 . We note early date antidiabetic drug dispensings within cohort membership , also note subsequent initiation antidiabetic drug . We choose subset comparator cohort randomly select approximately 9 time large exenatide initiator oversample patient receive certain drug extent necessary ensure inclusion least many person initiate drug initiate exenatide . Specifically , oversampling perform needed initiator metformin , TZDs , SUs , sitagliptin insulin glargine allow subanalysis . Exenatide Other Antidiabetic Drug Initiators : For patient two study cohort , date cohort entry ( date range January 1 , 2005 December 31 , 2007 ) mark begin observation study outcome ( followup ) . The end observation give patient happen early occurrence likely acute pancreatitis , end study period ( March 31 , 2008 ) , disenrollment health plan . NonDiabetes Cohort : A third cohort consist randomlyselected Ingenix Research Data Mart member claim associate diabetes diagnosis antidiabetic drug dispense baseline continuous enrollment period . This cohort enter later 1 June 2005 completion 9 month continuous baseline enrollment provide followup end enrollment 31 March 2008 , receipt antidiabetic drug dispense diabetes diagnosis , point may enter one exposure cohorts . The 3 cohort ( exenatide initiator , antidiabetic initiator , without diabetes ) subject minimal exclusion order observe acute pancreatitis across wide spectrum patient characteristic . We apply baseline enrollment requirement 9 month prior cohort entry first day followup ( acute pancreatitis could occur ) characterize level detail ( base 9 month precede health insurance claim ) day study . Consistent principle minimal exclusion , exclude cohort people baseline claim associate pancreatitis ( 9month period precede cohort entry ) people either preexist pancreatitis preexist suspicion pancreatitis . We exclude person type I diabetes diagnosis intend observe spectrum clinical practice respect antidiabetic drug initiation .</criteria>
