For patient cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) assessment eligibility must perform least 3 month device implantation Treated HF optimal , stable pharmacological therapy . In general , optimal treatment include betablocker Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker ( ARB ) dose show efficacious Heart Failure ( HF ) trial , unless tolerate . Stable medical therapy define new HF drug class introduce 4 week prior enrollment , although dos drug may adjust throughout trial Considered appropriate candidate study enrollment determine patient 's clinical laboratory finding , vital sign electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) within normal range , outside normal range deem clinically significant opinion Investigator For female patient : The patient postmenopausal ( ≥ 1 year ) sterilize , childbearing potential , breastfeeding , pregnancy test negative , intention become pregnant course study within 1 week follow last dose omecamtiv mecarbil , use highly effective method birth control .
