	<brief_summary>This proposal respond Request Applications RFA-MH-08-131 , seek application propose enrich pre-existing resource schizophrenia NIMH Human Genetics Initiative apply genomic method understand molecular etiology disorder . The overarch aim proposal quickly cost-effectively ascertain large sample trio family affect schizophrenia , discover causal variant disorder first family-based genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) disorder . In Taiwan , kind policy support kind GWAS study expensive study , include collect large family sample genome-wide SNP scan . We , thus , collaborate Professor Ming T , Tsuang extend subcontract researcher apply project . We , research team Taiwan , collect 3800 trio family ( 11400 subject ) schizophrenia . In recently complete NIMH-funded Genetic Linkage Study Schizophrenia ( R01MH059624 ; USA PI : Ming T. Tsuang ; Taiwan PI : Hai-Gwo Hwu ) , investigator establish large efficient ascertainment network infrastructure Taiwan , utilize expand propose study . Through additional ascertainment within framework , investigator collect aggregate sample adequate power detecting GWAS variant make even small contribution risk disorder . The investigator meet overarching goal project accomplish several Specific Aims , follow : 1 . Rapidly ascertain schizophrenia trio family ten Taiwanese clinical ascertainment site ; 2 . Supplement NIMH Genetics Initiative collection send clinical data biomaterials appropriate repository ; 3 . Assess association schizophrenia genome-wide panel single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) constituent haplotype ; 4 . Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotype age onset ; 5 . Perform genome-wide survey copy-number variation relate schizophrenia ; 6 . Test gene-gene interaction ( epistasis ) ; 7 . Test gene-environment interaction , well-established effect season birth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanding Rapid Ascertainment Networks Schizophrenia Families Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past four decade , researcher become increasingly certain schizophrenia complex , multifactorial etiology . Although many twin study confirm gene play substantial role etiology disable disorder,5 genome-wide linkage analysis schizophrenia produce conflicting result . While many study identify chromosomal region show evidence linkage schizophrenia , find consistently replicate . Given high heritability schizophrenia,5 failure linkage method find susceptibility gene suggest gene small , incremental effect expression disorder . Risch Merikangas6 show gene small effect , power linkage study low power association study high . Although meta-analysis candidate gene association study implicate gene , finding ( even confirm large study ) would account small fraction schizophrenia 's heritability . These consideration suggest genome-wide association scan would effective method find schizophrenia susceptibility gene . To end , investigator design multi-stage analytic plan involve rapid continued ascertainment probands family member establish clinical ascertainment network Taiwan , perform genome-wide association scan ( GWAS ) large sample affect nuclear family , pool novel GWAS result project exist case-control GWAS study schizophrenia . To accomplish objective , investigator propose series specific aim , follow : 1 . Supplement previously collect sample 1,200 Han Chinese schizophrenia-affected nuclear family Taiwan rapidly screen collect additional 3,800 trio eleven ascertainment site Taiwan ; 2 . Assess association schizophrenia genome-wide panel single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) constituent haplotype ; 3 . Perform genome-wide survey copy-number variation relate schizophrenia ; 4 . Test gene-gene interaction epistasis ; 5 . Test gene-environment interaction , well-established effect season birth ; 6 . Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotype , age onset ; 7 . Enhance NIMH Genetics Initiative collection send clinical data , biomaterials , genotype appropriate repository , complete meta-analysis family-based GWAS data exist case-control GWASs schizophrenia repository ; The aim achieve goal RFA several way . First , propose work would markedly enrich exist resource NIMH Human Genetics Initiative , especially current pool schizophrenia-affected nuclear family . Not would data biomaterials project enrich NIMH repository , study design readily combinable already repositories boost power available detect gene small effect risk . Further , propose project would apply late genomic research method understand molecular etiology disorder . Lastly , capitalize exist clinical infrastructure efficient screen assessment protocol , investigator obtain well-powered sample rapid cost-effective manner .</detailed_description>
