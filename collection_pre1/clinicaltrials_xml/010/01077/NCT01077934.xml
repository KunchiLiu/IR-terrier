	<brief_summary>The purpose study define reliability accuracy Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) detection intra-compartmental tissue perfusion injure noninjured extremity time . We hypothesize technology , combine vital sign , intracompartmental pressure clinical examination , useful diagnose acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) , monitor patient risk ACS , evaluate adequacy fasciotomy patient treat ACS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) associate low leg trauma 20 % high energy injury . ACS occur pressure due swell exceeds perfusion pressure thereby cut blood flow leg . If untreated , result catastrophic insensate , contract leg . Moreover , high risk subsequent infection even amputation . The treatment ACS , four compartment fasciotomy , aim releasing pressure two incision roughly knee ankle . Often due wound expansion , incision require multiple debridement skin graft close . With fasciotomies , fracture convert closed open injury . When leave open many day , risk infection complication nonunion increase significantly . The accepted objective method diagnosis ACS measure pressure inside leg compartment use large gauge needle hooked pressure monitor . However , reading erroneous perform correctly . As , ACS continue clinical diagnosis make base surgeon 's experience interpretation character injury ( high-energy , motorcycle crash , vs. low-energy , twisted ankle ) . Clinicians leave attempt interpret physical exam finding reading pressure monitor . Most importantly ACS event , process manifest multiple point injury . The accurate effective method diagnose appropriately treat ACS serial examination course hour day . With study , hope evaluate NIRS device , non-invasive , diagnostic tool evaluation acute compartment syndrome . We plan evaluate patient gold standard diagnose acute compartment syndrome simultaneously evaluate patient NIRS device . This allow u determine NIRS device accurately reliably predict development acute compartment syndrome non-invasive , longitudinal manner . `` Access precise , reliable , noninvasive method early diagnosis ACS would landmark achievement orthopaedic emergency medicine .
