	<brief_summary>Rationale : For woman early-stage breast cancer , bone frequent site relapse , woman advance breast cancer eventually develop disease bone . Denosumab , fully human monoclonal antibody specifically inhibit RANK ligand , may potential interrupt hypothetical `` vicious cycle '' cancer-induced bone destruction tumor cell expansion bone . It yet know denosumab may prevent disease recurrence bone part body . Purpose : This randomized phase 3 trial study effect denosumab see prevent disease recurrence bone part body , give adjuvant therapy woman early-stage breast cancer , high risk disease recurrence .</brief_summary>
