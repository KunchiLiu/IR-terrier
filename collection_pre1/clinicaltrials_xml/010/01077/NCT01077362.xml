	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Ustekinumab Patients With Psoriatic Arthritis With Without Prior Exposure Anti-TNF Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take , dosage ) , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate effectiveness safety ustekinumab compare placebo treatment patient active psoriatic arthritis currently receive treatment disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , include previously receive anti-tumor necrosis factor ( anti-TNF ) agent [ ( example infliximab ( Remicade ) , etanercept ( Enbrel ) , adalimumab ( Humira ) ] . The primary effectiveness endpoint measure reduction sign symptom arthritis , define 20 % improvement baseline American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) measurement arthritis Week 24 . The study additionally look high level joint improvement ( ie , 50 % 70 % improvement baseline ) improvement activity quality life , well impact ustekinumab psoriatic skin lesion . Safety assessment perform throughout study include obtain evaluate laboratory test , vital sign ( eg , blood pressure ) occurrence severity adverse event ( side effect ) . Patients assign one three treatment group . Patients receive either 45 mg ustekinumab , 90 mg ustekinumab , placebo Weeks 0 , 4 every 12 week Week 40 . Patients &gt; =5 % improvement disease ( tender swollen joint ) Week 16 may eligible receive increase change ustekinumab dosage . Ustekinumab 45 mg , 90 mg , placebo subcutaneous injection Weeks 0 4 follow every-12-week dosing last dose Week 40 . Early escape possibility Week 16 . Patients randomize placebo crossover receive ustekinumab Weeks 24 28 follow every-12-week dosing last dose Week 40 . Expected duration exposure study agent include follow safety 60 week .</detailed_description>
