	<brief_summary>The assessment otelixizumab rheumatoid arthritis subject provide safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic information enable identification appropriate safe well-tolerated dosage regimen use clinical efficacy study . This study consist screen phase , follow treatment period four cohort subject receive 5 daily intravenous infusion otelixizumab . The cumulative dose increase successive cohort infusion rate adjust base sign symptom cytokine release syndrome ensure specify maximum infusion rate exceed . Serial blood sample obtain clinical laboratory testing , determination pharmacodynamic marker , serum otelixizumab PK parameter , exploratory biomarkers immunogenicity . Safety pharmacodynamic data previous cohort ( ) evaluate prior dose subsequent cohort ensure safety . Adverse event , laboratory value , vital sign ECG 's monitor closely study . All subject study undergo long-term follow-up 48 month monitor patient safety .</brief_summary>
