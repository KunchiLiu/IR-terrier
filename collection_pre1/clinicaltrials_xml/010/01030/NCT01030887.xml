	<brief_summary>Many cancer survivor suffer symptom fatigue dyspnea may persist year month chemotherapy finish . Despite known benefit exercise potential address many symptom cancer , type practical exercise programme best suit population know . Many exercise programme perform cancer survivor take place many week month include people specific type cancer . Such programme may therefore suitable majority cancer survivor would pose serious practical difficulty high drop-out rate expensive resource consumption extend clinical practice . We propose run 8-week exercise intervention mixed cancer population . Hypothesis : A brief , individually tailor 8-week intervention increase fitness improve physical symptom mixed cancer survivor population chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEACH Trial : Prescribed Exercise After Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Many cancer survivor suffer range physical psychological symptom may persist year month treatment finish . Despite known benefit exercise potential address many adverse effect treatment , role exercise well optimum duration , frequency , intensity population yet fully elucidate . Many cancer rehabilitation programme present literature long , tight eligibility criterion likely practical majority cancer survivor . We plan investigate novel brief 8-week intervention aim increase physical fitness , address physical symptom heterogeneous cancer survivor population . Methods/design : Approximately 60 cancer survivor 2-6 month completion chemotherapy , usually adjuvant , curative intent recruit oncology clinic single institution randomise usual care exercise intervention . The exercise intervention consist two specifically tailor , supervise , moderate intensity aerobic exercise session per week 8 week . All participant assess baseline ( 0 week ) , post intervention ( 8 week ) , 3-month follow-up . The primary outcome measure fitness , secondary patient-related outcome measure include fatigue , quality life , morphological outcome . A secondary outcome process evaluation include adherence compliance exercise program . Discussion : This study provide valuable information physical outcomes 8-week supervised aerobic programme . Additional process information economic evaluation inform feasibility implement program heterogeneous population chemotherapy treatment curative intent .</detailed_description>
