	<detailed_description>1 . Study name : Amlodipine Prevents Morning Blood Pressure Surge Study ( ARMORS ) 2 . Study drug : amlodipine ( Norvasc® ) nifedipine GITS ( Adalat® ) 3 . Rationale : Previous meta-analyses randomize controlled trial demonstrate long acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine ( Norvasc® ) , compare antihypertensive drug , provide protection stroke . The benefit amlodipine stroke approximately 10 % great diuretics/β-blockers , 20 % great angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker . Of dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , amlodipine provide protection myocardial infarction similar angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , diuretic β-blockers , angiotensin receptor blocker . The benefit amlodipine prevention stroke might attributable 24-h blood pressure control . 24-h ambulatory blood pressure predictive cardiovascular event clinic pressure measure doctor 's office . The smooth 24-h ambulatory blood pressure control , low risk target organ damage . Both systolic diastolic blood pressure show circadian rhythm nocturnal blood pressure fall morning blood pressure surge . The incidence cardiovascular complication hypertension , myocardial infarction stroke , high early morning hour rest day . Several previous study demonstrate exaggerated morning blood pressure surge associate incidence stoke cardiovascular structural remodeling . Moreover , non-dipping blood pressure night ( non-dipper , nighttime blood pressure fall le 10 % ) prevalent associate high risk cardiovascular event . In recent study control hypertensive patient , prevalence non-dipping blood pressure night 62 % . In JingNing population study , find Chinese high nighttime diastolic blood pressure White population , prevalence isolate nocturnal hypertension 10.9 % . Patients isolated nocturnal hypertension compare normotensive subject increase arterial stiffness . Thus , preferable antihypertensive drug reduce 24-h mean level blood pressure , also effectively control morning blood pressure surge reduce nighttime blood pressure . At present , two mechanism long-acting antihypertensive agent . One compound long half life time hence show long term effect . Another efficacy short-acting drug elongate use slow release control release ( GITS ) technique . However , latter mechanism may vary individual difference gastrointestinal function . Therefore , long-acting compound reliable maintenance long term efficacy slow release control release agent . In class dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , amlodipine long-acting compound long half life time ( 50 hour ) , nifedipine GITS use control release technique . Several recent study compare 24-h blood pressure lower effect 2 drug , produce inconsistent result . At least one study suggest amlodipine may prevent morning blood pressure rise effectively nifedipine GITS . However , study demonstrate similar effect morning blood pressure control 2 drug . The inconsistency might attributable chance finding , small sample size ( le 100 ) . Therefore , randomize control trial large sample size require compare 2 dihydropyridines blood pressure control 24 hour general early morning hour night particular . 4 . Objective : The primary objective study test hypothesis amlodipine compare nifedipine GITS strong effect prevent morning blood pressure surge ( 4 8 ) mild moderate hypertensive patient . The secondary objective study compare effect amlodipine nifedipine GITS reduce nighttime blood pressure ( 10 pm 4 ) patient decrease nocturnal blood pressure fall . 5 . Study design : The present study design randomize , actively control , multi-centre parallel group trial ( phase Ⅳ ) two equally sized treatment group : amlodipine nifedipine GITS . 6 . Study population : In 20 research-oriented university hospital China pre-defined timeframe , 500 patient consider inclusion present study accord inclusion/exclusion criterion . 7 . Randomization treatment : After stratification centre , 500 eligible patient randomize 2 group . 250 receive amlodipine 5 mg per day , 250 receive nifedipine GITS 30 mg per day . At 4 week follow-up , drug dosage per day may increase 10 mg amlodipine 60 mg nifedipine GITS , blood pressure measure doctor 's office control level 140/90 mm Hg . If compelling indication , antihypertensive drug allow 2-month trial . All antihypertensive medication take breakfast 6-8 clock morning . 8 . Follow : All patient give write informed consent entry present study . In addition 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , patient also undergo questionnaire survey clinical measurement include clinic blood pressure . Patients follow normal working hour morning afternoon . The precise follow-up time day record . At follow-up visit , responsible physician measure patient 's blood pressure pulse rate , collect information use medication , serious adverse event , adverse event cardiovascular complication . At 4 8 week follow-up , 24-h 48-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring perform , respectively . When 48-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring perform 8 week follow-up , patient take antihypertensive medication second day monitoring . Only validate blood pressure monitor ( SpaceLabs 90207 90217 ) use . Before ambulatory blood pressure measurement , blood pressure monitor set standardized way . A cuff proper size secure leave arm patient . Before commencement ambulatory blood pressure measurement , blood pressure measure twice use mercury sphygmomanometer . Immediately 2 measurement , blood pressure measure twice manually monitor . Then , blood pressure measure automatically accord predefined time interval blood pressure monitor ( every 20 minute 8 10 pm every 30 minute 10 pm 8 ) . At end ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , data transfer computer program . The size cuff arm use 3 ambulatory measurement patient . On monitoring day , patient record time go bed get , use medication , physical activity . 9 . Potential difficulty : During study , ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may fail less 20 reading whole day , less 10 reading daytime less 5 reading night . These fail measurement repeat . 10 . Sample size estimation statistical analysis : It project standard deviation morning blood pressure enrol hypertensive patient 12 mm Hg , amlodipine , compare nifedipine GITS , reduce morning blood pressure 4 month follow-up 4 mm Hg . If α=0.05 power=90 % , study require sample size 190 hypertensive patient per group detect project difference morning blood pressure ( 4 am-8 ) . After account 5 % drop rate 20 % patient add-on therapy , sample size group 250 . Thus number require subject whole trial 500 . The trial mainly compare amlodipine nifedipine GITS group change morning blood pressure ( 4 am-8 , 8 blood pressure reading ) nighttime blood pressure ( 10 pm-4 ) 4 8 week baseline . The student test use 95 % confidence interval difference 2 group compute . In addition , adjust analysis ( ANOVA ) also perform account major baseline characteristic . 11 . Timeline : The trial start October 2009 , 500 eligible patient would randomize follow 2 month . Database construction statistical analysis take 3 month . The trial publish international congress English Chinese literature 2013 . 12 . Organization : The principal investigator Professor Jiguang Wang Centre Epidemiological Studies Clinical Trials , Ruijin Hospital , Shanghai , China . Professor Yan Li centre coordinator trial . 20 research orient hospital participate recruitment study subject . At least 20 subject recruit participate hospital .</detailed_description>
