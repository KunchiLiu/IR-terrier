	<brief_title>Rivastigmine Huperzine A Treatments Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate interaction cocaine oral rivastigmine cocaine oral huperzine A ( HupA ) . The follow Specific Aims propose : 1 . Among cocaine-dependent , non-treatment seek participant , establish ability rivastigmine ( 3 6 mg , daily ) HupA ( 0.4 0.8 mg , daily ) , compare placebo , reduce cocaine-induced craving ( 0 , 20 , 40 mg , IV ) reduce reinforce effect produce cocaine ( 20 mg , IV/infusion ) . Hypothesis . Relative placebo-treated participant , treatment rivastigmine HupA reduce cocaine-induced craving choice cocaine . 2 . To determine safety rivastigmine HupA cocaine-dependent participant receive cocaine laboratory set . Hypothesis 2A . Relative placebo-treated participant , treatment rivastigmine HupA increase adverse event produce cocaine . Hypothesis 2B . Relative placebo-treated participant , treatment rivastigmine HupA reduce cocaine-induced increase heart rate blood pressure . 3 . To determine effect AChE inhibition plasma level cocaine cocaine metabolite . Hypothesis 3A . Relative placebo-treated participant , treatment rivastigmine , HupA , associate increase plasma level cocaine . Hypothesis 3B . Relative placebo-treated participant , treatment rivastigmine , HupA , associate increase formation ecgonine benzoylecgonine , decrease formation ecgonine methylester . 4. ) provide frequent measure heart rate ( 15 sec vs. 5 minute ) b ) measure new dependent variable , physical activity , day without cocaine exposure . Public Health Significance : Cocaine abuse important health problem associate serious medical , psychiatric , social , economic consequence . No medication currently available prevention relapse patient addict cocaine , compound rivastigmine HupA predict useful indication . The test HupA particularly excite since antioxidant neuroprotective property may also contribute efficacy treatment medication cocaine dependence .</detailed_description>
