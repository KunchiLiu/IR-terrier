	<detailed_description>This program compare progressive strength , flexibility , tone balance ( FlexToBa ) activity deliver via home-based DVD intervention compare attention control group determine program 's effect functional limitation , functional performance everyday activity , balance , quality life ( QOL ) sedentary old adult 65 year age . The principal REAIM ( Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ) implement design evaluation program order determine generalizable cost-effectiveness potential public health impact deliver physical activity old adult via DVD medium . Measurements assess baseline , six month , 12 month include : functional performance functional limitation , self-efficacy , physical activity , measure health status well-being . We propose recruit randomly assign 250 old ( 65+ ) adult across Central Illinois FlexToBa condition attention control condition . The former receive activity program DVD latter receive healthy age DVD ( physical activity instruction ) . The control group offer FlexToBa program follow 6-month follow-up assessment . The health relevance project considerable target population largely sedentary suffers unprecedented level functional limitation , factor significant implication compromise quality life independent living . By adopt broad recruitment strategy exclusionary criterion , able effectively improve physical activity behavior diverse class older adult . Offering DVD-based physical activity program provide convenient opportunity old adult become stay physically active . We intend provide limited number DVD player interested participant already one . In 2014 , investigator study comparative effectiveness FlexToBa DVD trial compare DVD-only intervention.Researchers provide exercise DVD entire wave/group participant half receive motivational telephone call feedback ( earlier wave ) half receive motivational communication . The procedure Support Group , receive motivational support , identical earlier wave . Both group receive FlexToBa DVDs equipment initial test orientation meeting Effectiveness Group receive motivational feedback . Testing month six identical earlier wave group ask evaluate program end intervention . There plan follow-up test month 12 month 24 wave participant .</detailed_description>
