	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : Aim study compare efficacy safety two different sequence chemotherapeutic agent order optimize treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer progress first line chemotherapy FOLFIRI bevacizumab . Primary endpoint overall survival , define time elapsed date randomization date patient death due cause , last date patient know alive . Secondary Objectives Progression free survival , Quality life , Health resource utilisation economic evaluation , Toxicity incidence adverse event The study regimen include : Strategy A : FOLFOX-4 follow , progression , irinotecan/cetuximab Strategy B : irinotecan/cetuximab follow , progression , FOLFOX-4 Patients randomly assign one two treatment sequence ( 1:1 ratio ) use block design randomization procedure stratify accord center . The patient accrual period plan approximately 36 month . To assess OS , pts follow 18 month last patient randomise . The maximum estimate study duration approximately 54 months.All statistical analysis base intention-to-treat approach . CONSORT rule apply describe study flow protocol deviation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Target population : Patients histologically confirm metastatic colorectal cancer progress first line treatment contain FOLFIRI BEV Inclusion criterion : - Age &gt; 18 &lt; 75 year age - Diagnosis histologically proven adenocarcinoma colon rectum , stage IV - K-ras wild-type - ECOG performance status 0-1 study entry Endpoints : - Response Rate , Disease control rate , The duration overall response , Overall survival , PFS , Time treatment failure , Quality Life , Incidence AEs , Frequency nature serious adverse reaction ( SADRs ) , Premature withdrawal Statistical method : Assuming randomization ratio 1:1 , 282 death require order achieve power 80 % detect hazard ratio 0.72 favour one two sequence , translate increase median survival time 10 14 month , type I error 5 % , two-sided , use Mantel-Cox version log-rank test . With uniform accrual period 3 year follow-up 18 month , 350 patient need reach target number event . All statistical analysis base intention-to-treat approach . CONSORT rule apply describe study flow protocol deviation . All OS PFS curve draw Kaplan-Meier method . Results present Hazard Ratio ( HRs ) 95 % Confidence Interval ( CIs ) . On annual basis , start second year , interim analysis conduct . In principle , formal stopping rule apply , unless otherwise suggest DSMC . Safety report draw annual basis .</detailed_description>
