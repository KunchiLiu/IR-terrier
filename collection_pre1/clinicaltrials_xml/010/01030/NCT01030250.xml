	<brief_title>Longitudinal Impact Adjuvant Chemotherapy Functional Status , Comorbidity Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 % cancer 70 % cancer mortality occur people great 65 year age , define cancer disease old adult . Breast cancer exception rule almost half new breast cancer United States diagnose woman 65 year age older1 . Despite association cancer age , treatment recommendation data acquire prospective clinical trial older woman breast cancer sparse . As result , physician older adult limit data guide treatment recommendation , make dose adjustment manage toxicity older adult . Aging invariably associate change physiology impact pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics cancer therapy . The potential increase toxic effect older patient becomes important concern . Therefore , may reasonable extrapolate data regard toxicity clinical trial , primarily include young , healthy patient . In addition , age-related impact adjuvant therapy functional status quality life old versus young adult rigorously evaluate , risk factor toxicity , chronological age , need study among old adult receive anthracycline non-anthracycline base chemotherapy regimen . The goal study prospectively describe longitudinal trajectory functional status , comorbidity , quality life initiation chemotherapy 6 month completion treatment older ( 65 old ) young ( 65 ) adult . We determine effect pre-treatment physical functioning physical recovery ( ie , physical function end chemotherapy 6 month later ) course adjuvant chemotherapy . In addition , explore factor chronological age ( functional status , comorbid medical condition , nutritional status , psychological state , cognitive function , social support ) predict patient likely experience treatment morbidity ( define grade 3-5 toxicity , hospitalization urgent care visit , dose reduction delay , premature discontinuation plan chemotherapy course )</detailed_description>
