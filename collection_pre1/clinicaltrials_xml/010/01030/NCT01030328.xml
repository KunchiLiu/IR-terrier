	<detailed_description>This study examine approve drug ( TriLipix ) , use combination statin ( drug lower blood cholesterol level ) , affect makeup plaque . Comparison effect makeup plaque do use coronary artery CTA , participant enrollment end study . Those meet eligibility criterion sign inform consent enrol study . Patients instructed nutritional guideline lifestyle change heart-healthy living . If patient coronary CTA within past two ( 2 ) month , undergo procedure enrollment . If patient coronary CTA within past two ( 2 ) month , undergo coronary CTA contrast . Patients randomly assign receive either study treatment ( 135 mg TriLipix plus 40 mg Atorvastatin ) comparison treatment ( placebo two pill contain active treatment ) . They 50 % chance receiving study treatment 50 % chance receive comparison treatment . This double-blind study , mean patient , research staff , physician know treatment patient receiving . However , case emergency , information immediately available physician . Follow-up visit occur 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month . All patient CTA end treatment .</detailed_description>
