	<detailed_description>Objectives Orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) condition contributes fall , dizziness , syncope , transient ischemic attack , impair functional status . OH define specifically 20mmHg drop systolic , and/or 10mmHg drop diastolic BP within 3 min standing . The objective study : ( 1 ) Examine effect OH treatment functional outcome , OH prevalence subject 's inpatient stay , ( 2 ) Evaluate whether OH treatment subject 's inpatient stay affect fall prevalence , functional outcome 12 month discharge . Plan This 4-year project randomize controlled trial multidisciplinary-multicomponent intervention improve OH patient admit Nursing Home ( NH ) rehabilitation setting . During 37-month enrollment period , investigator expect consent 350 subject randomize intervention control group ( 175 subject ) . During stay , subject intervention group receive standardize treatment OH , prevent OH , control group receive usual care . The investigator expect 85 % remain study discharge NH/rehabilitation unit . Following discharge , investigator conduct weekly phone call monitor incidence fall one month . Subsequently , 12-months post-discharge , investigator conduct chart review , study terminate . The investigator expect 85 % subject discharge NH/rehabilitation unit enrol study remain study 12-months post discharge . The investigator perform `` pilot '' study 10 subject wait adequate staffing conduct study blind data collector . Methods The investigator evaluate OH blood pressure response , symptom stand , whether specific adverse outcome related treatment . In addition , investigator evaluate whether treatment OH improve : motor functional independence measure ( mFIM ) score , therapy participation , length stay , transfer acute care hospital , discharge location , mortality . Clinical Relevance OH common find many medically ill adult elderly patient , associate fall , syncope , hip fracture . More aggressive screening ( possibly 6th vital sign ) management condition may improve outcome rehabilitation long term care patient investigator ' site well high-risk patient population .</detailed_description>
