	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Decreasing Food Cravings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , use low amplitude direct current stimulation human cortex receive attention possible treatment depression pain ( Been et al , 2007 ) . This technique ( call transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS ) involve placement two sponge electrode separate area scalp . tDCS show capable change excitability superficial neuron immediately beneath sponge electrode . Evidence suggest anodal stimulation associate increase cortical excitability cathodal stimulation associate decreased cortical excitability ( Been et al , 2007 ) . Brain imaging study begin elucidate functional neuroanatomy craving ( George , Anton , Bloomer , Teneback , Drobes , Lorberbaum , et al. , 2001 ; Myrick , Anton , Li , Henderson , Drobes , Voronin , et al. , 2004 ) . While role prefrontal cortex regulate craving remain somewhat unclear , frontal cortical area appear involve integrate incoming sensory information ( sight , smell , sound ) affective/emotional information brain , may involve regulate emotional reaction various stimulus ( Alexander , DeLong , &amp; Strick , 1986 ; Lorenz , Minoshima , &amp; Casey , 2003 ) . The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex may become activated individual present cue trigger reward memory associate certain consumptive behavior ( Anton , 1999 ) . One fMRI study find alcoholic subject present alcohol related cue , great activation leave prefrontal cortex anterior thalamus , compare view non-alcohol cue ( George et al. , 2001 ) . Other study bulimia drug craving identify hyperactivity orbitofrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex associate increase craving rating ( Goldstein &amp; Volkow , 2002 ; Uher , et al. , 2004 ) . Very study attempt directly manipulate activation brain structure might involve craving . tDCS allow researcher selectively activate inhibit different brain structure might play role crave behavior . Previous research manipulate activation brain structure find alcohol craving decrease among individual alcohol dependence receive either leave right anodal stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( Boggio et al. , 2008 ) . This finding , combine prior functional neuroanatomical work , research relation food craving nicotine craving suggest share common biologic mechanism ( Pepino , Finkbiener , Menella 2009 , 2007 ) , suggest prefrontal cortex may reasonable preliminary tDCS cortical target potentially inhibiting food craving . To date , one publish study examine relationship tDCS food craving . Fregni colleague ( 2008 ) find craving reduce anode right/cathode leave tDCS craving increase anode left/cathode right tDCS . The evidence effectiveness tDCS decrease food crave indicates relatively short-lived effect ( lasting week ) . While may ultimately limit utility tDCS , may place prevention management obesity . This study aim evaluate effectiveness transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) decrease food craving . Specifically , study determine whether healthy subject report decrease food crave follow single 20-minute session tDCS ( compare sham tDCS ) deliver immediately follow exposure food stimulus .</detailed_description>
