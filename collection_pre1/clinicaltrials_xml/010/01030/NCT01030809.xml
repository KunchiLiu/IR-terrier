	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic inflammatory disorder gastrointestinal tract . During disease exacerbation , pharmacological surgical intervention usually need re-establish remission .

Nevertheless , reality many patient CD receive effective therapy disease often remain active , lead uncontrolled inflammation complication either underlying disease corticosteroid . Although treatment guideline exist , adequately define treatment goal duration treatment cycle specify Optimizing outcomes CD require rapid control inflammation . Intuitively , persistent inflammation lead persistent symptom , tissue damage , disease-related complication . Conventional therapy frequently ineffective moderate severe CD , often continue prolonged time . Consequently , many patient under-treated . An alternate strategy minimizes use corticosteroid encourages earlier use immunosuppressive agent tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) antagonists may optimal .
