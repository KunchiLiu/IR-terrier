	<detailed_description>Chronic urticaria common condition debilitating , difficult treat , sometimes life-threatening . Approximately 15-25 % population affect urticaria least lifetime , chronic urticaria develop 25 % case . Chronic urticaria characterize frequent , often daily , development pruritic wheal 6 week duration longer . The average duration chronic urticaria 3-5 year adult . In majority case , underlie trigger urticaria identify case refer idiopathic ( CIU ) . These consideration lead hypothesis CIU may autoimmune etiology . CIU major affliction cause serious disability degree equal experienced sufferer coronary artery disease . Antihistamines common therapy use . However , case CIU resistant combination antihistamine therapy . In addition , patient often intolerant side effect antihistamines include sedation cognitive dysfunction . The treatment CIU patient frustrate . For respond typical treatment , therapy need . In many patient , immunosuppressant medication require lead adverse effect renal dysfunction , liver function abnormality , anemia . A safer efficacious therapy clearly need CIU . A preclinical investigation demonstrate upregulation TNF-alpha patient CIU . This contrast acute urticaria TNF-alpha appear play important role inflammatory response . This may explain patient CIU typically respond usual therapy acute urticaria . It suggest CIU immediate hypersensitivity phenomenon appear immediately exposure antigen , presence delay inflammatory phase nevertheless observe pathology . Soluble factor play role delay inflammatory phase . Cytokines , include TNF-alpha , important mediator pathogenesis delay response . Studies demonstrate similar immune profile find patient rheumatoid arthritis . In one study , cytokine evaluate lesional non-lesional skin patient acute urticaria , CIU , delayed pressure urticaria , cold urticaria . This study demonstrate upregulation TNF-alpha endothelial cell perivascular cell dermis . Additionally , TNF-alpha express throughout epidermis lesional non-lesional skin CIU patient , control . These preclinical investigation support use target therapy TNF-alpha patient CIU . Therapies direct modulate effect TNF-alpha , include etanercept , may provide effective safe long-term treatment patient respond anti-histamines alone . HYPOTHESIS : We hypothesize blockage TNF etanercept could useful safe therapy patient CIU . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective : To determine efficacy etanercept clinical feature CIU . A positive response treatment ( % change baseline urticaria activity score Secondary Objective : Study safety etanercept treatment CIU</detailed_description>
