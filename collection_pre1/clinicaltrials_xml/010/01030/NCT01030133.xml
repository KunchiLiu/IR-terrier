	<detailed_description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) minimally invasive brain stimulation technology focally stimulate brain awake individual.1,2 A localized pulsed magnetic field transmit figure-8 coil ( lasting microsecond ) able focally stimulate cortex depolarize superficial neurons3,4 induces electrical current brain.5 If TMS pulse deliver repetitively rhythmically , process call repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) . rTMS prefrontal cortex show produce temporary analgesic effect healthy adult use laboratory pain method patient chronic pain various etiology . However , little known mechanism action . Evidence functional MRI study suggest participant ' perceive controllability pain stimulus associate decreased pain experience decrease activation cortical subcortical area involve pain perception.6 Perceived controllability may involve prefrontal cortical circuit may involve inhibition limbic system responses painful stimulus . To date , study investigate interaction prefrontal TMS perceive controllability pain perception healthy adult . Building extensive pilot work experience area laboratory pain assessment TMS Brain Stimulation Laboratory MUSC , investigator propose investigate effect perceive controllability prefrontal TMS pain perception healthy adult . This study may help determine whether TMS use stimulate cortical area think involve perceived controllability , thus enhance one 's sense controllability thereby substantially reduce pain intensity unpleasantness . Although transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) consider minimal risk intervention , approve treatment depression , widely use around world , little known mechanism action prefrontal rTMS depression pain . There evidence prefrontal cortex involve perception control may moderate effect perceive controllability emotional reactivity painful stimulus . The present study aim investigate effect prefrontal rTMS perceive controllability pain perception healthy adult .</detailed_description>
