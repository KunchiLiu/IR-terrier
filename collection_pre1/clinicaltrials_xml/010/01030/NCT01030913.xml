	<brief_summary>B type chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) prevalent leukemia western world . It disease occurs primarily age individual occur frequently male female . Although B-CLL consider homogeneous condition , recent study laboratory others suggest B-CLL case divide two subgroup . These sub-groups identify either presence absence mutation antibody gene and/or percentage B-CLL cell express particular protein call CD38 . These two sub-groups ( unmutated antibody gene high percent CD38 mutate antibody gene low percentage CD38 ) follow strikingly clinically different course . For example , unmutated/CD38+ group experience much aggressive disease patient almost invariably die much sooner case group . In addition , patient mutate CD38+ group require much chemotherapy mutatedlCD38- . Finally , surprisingly much high representation male poor outcome unmutated CD38 group well outcome group . The reason difference clinical outcome gender bias unknown .</brief_summary>
