	<brief_summary>Background : - Studies conduct National Cancer Institute suggest certain chemotherapy drug may effective give continuous infusion vein rather standard method rapid intravenous injection . One combination six chemotherapy drug , know EPOCH-R , high degree effectiveness people certain kind cancer . - Recent evidence also indicate effect chemotherapy may improve combine treatment monoclonal antibody , purify protein specially make attach foreign substance cancer cell . A monoclonal antibody call campath ( alemtuzumab ) manufacture attach protein call CD52 may target tumor cell surround inflammatory cell . - Researchers interested develop new treatment large B-cell lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma best treat chemotherapy . This protocol specifically people diffuse large B-cell Hodgkin lymphoma respond standard treatment . Objectives : - To test whether give campath ( alemtuzumab ) combination continuous infusion EPOCH-R chemotherapy improve outcome lymphoma treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old large B-cell lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma respond well standard treatment . Design : - During study , patient receive standard EPOCH-R chemotherapy , include follow drug : etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , rituximab . The additional drug , campath , give IV infusion first day treatment several hour . - When campath IV infusion rituximab IV infusion complete , drug doxorubicin , etoposide , vincristine give continuous IV infusion next 4 day ( , continuously total 96 hour ) . Cyclophosphamide give IV infusion several hour Day 5 . Prednisone give mouth twice day 5 day . - Patients may give drug treat side effect chemotherapy , prevent possible infection , improve white blood cell count . - The campath-EPOCH-R therapy repeat every 21 day , cycle therapy , total 6 cycle . Following fourth sixth treatment cycle ( approximately week 12 18 ) campath-EPOCH-R treatment , study researcher perform blood test CT/MRI scan patient assess response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Alemtuzumab ( Campath ) Dose-Adjusted EPOCH-Rituximab ( DA-EPOCH-R ) Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Hodgkin Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Two signature microenvironment recently identify predictive outcome patient newly diagnose DLBCL treat R-CHOP . These signature , call stromal 1 stromal 2 , associate gene express infiltrate mononuclear cell . The stromal 2 signature , include gene associate angiogenesis , predictive inferior outcome . Based observation , interested target reactive cell microenvironment therapeutic strategy patient relapse refractory DLBCL . Along principle , also include patient relapse Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . The surround reactive cell around Hodgkin Reed Sternberg ( HRS ) cell think bystander cell appear provide important survival signal HRS cell . - CD52 one promise target highly express infiltrate cell DLBCL although HRS cell specifically . Anti-CD52 antibody may therapeutic value deplete reactive B T cell , monocyte microenvironment . - The dose alemtuzumab combination DA-EPOCH 30 mg IV , determine prior study do patient untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma . The main toxicity combination myelosuppression opportunistic infection . - An important component study obtain tumor tissue gene expression profile assess microenvironment signature look molecular signature target treatment patient progress ultimately correlate response outcome various end-points . Objectives : - Assess response , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) relapsed/refractory DLBCL Hodgkin Lymphoma . Eligibility : - Previously treat orrefractory classical large B-cell lymphoma , Grey-zone lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma , include Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma ( LPHL ) . - Age great equal 18 year adequate organ function . - HIV negative active CNS lymphoma . Study Design : - Patients receive 30mg Alemtuzumab day 1 therapy , follow Rituximab day 1 dose-adjusted EPOCH chemotherapy day 1-5 , six cycle therapy . - Tumor biopsy do treatment , 1 cycle therapy relapse . - It anticipate 10-15 patient per year may enrol onto trial . Thus , accrual 52 patient expect require approximately 4-5 year .</detailed_description>
