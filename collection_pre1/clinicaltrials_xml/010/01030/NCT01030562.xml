	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain good understand body 's response human papillomavirus ( HPV ) ( sexually transmit disease ) , vaccine booster shot . The study also determine factor related adolescent follow vaccination schedule . The HPV vaccine require 3 dos ( shot ) . Girls sometimes receive 3 shot recommend time sometimes girls receive shot non-recommended time . This study evaluate get shot non-recommended time affect level protection provide vaccine . Participants include 1400 girls 9-17 year old receiving third dose HPV vaccine primary care clinician . The parent/legal guardian subject may answer questionnaire related vaccine schedule . Study procedures include : medical history , questionnaires blood draw . Participants involve study 6 month time enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The immune response quadrivalent human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine non-clinical trial setting unknown . In addition , immune response follow administration vaccine substantially prolong interval unknown . Early indication suggest many girl receive vaccine prolong interval time may affect immunogenicity . The lack knowledge immunogenicity prolong interval vaccine dos precludes evidence base recommendation patient substantially late second third dose . Some clinician currently restart series others give dos incorrect interval ( unpublished observation ) without ability counsel patient expect level immune response protection . Examining immune response prior third dose one six month third dose allow well understanding immunogenicity vaccine immune response booster dos . Furthermore , determine factor related non-adherence adolescent age group important timely . As increase number vaccine recommend adolescent age group , elucidate factor involve non-adherence recommended dosing schedule critical . This information guide intervention aim increase adolescent adherence recommend schedule . Eligible girl 9 - 17 year old receiving quadrivalent HPV vaccine primary care provider enrol study day , prior , receive third HPV vaccine dose approximately 28 day third HPV dose . Blood immunogenicity test obtain three time throughout study : one month ( Study Day 28 ) six month ( Study Day 180 ) third dose ( Study Day 0 ) subject prior third dose subject time third dose ( regardless time interval first second dose ) . The primary analysis base compare geometric mean titer ( GMTs ) seroresponse rate subject receive vaccine dos substantially prolong interval GMTs seroresponse rate subject receive second third dose time . In addition , Study Day 0 , patient parent related factor know impact health care utilization may measure use questionnaire give parents/legal guardian 14 17 year old subject . Analysis base health care utilization model use determine factor associate non-adherence vaccine schedule . Initially , subject meet eligibility criterion enrol regardless time second third vaccine dos . When study arm reach accrual target , close enrollment . Enrollment entire study remain open control three primary experimental arm complete enrollment One experimental arm may drop study monitor accrual rate indicate it/they fully enrol timely fashion . Monitoring occur monthly . Assessment accrual rate occur semi-annually . The primary objective compare GMT one month complete three dose vaccination series 9 17 year old subject receive second and/or third dose substantially prolonged interval subject receive second third dose time adjust age .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Girls eligible : 9 17 year age ( define 9 year 0 day young 18 year age ) time receipt third HPV dose ; Receiving third human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine part routine health care ; Able willing complete study visit evaluation ; Able willing participate study provide write informed assent/consent ( applicable ) ; Parent legal guardian provide permission ( applicable ) . Parent/legal guardian inclusion criterion : At site administer survey health literacy assessment , parent legal guardian provide permission daughter participate study eligible participate parental questionnaire able provide inform consent . Girls meeting follow exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation . Unable comply study protocol . Receipt 3 dos human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine . Receipt blood blood product ( include immunoglobulin ) past 3 month anticipate receipt study period . History physical , mental , developmental disorder study personnel believe may hinder participant 's ability comply study requirement . History malignancy confirm suspected immunodeficient condition , human immunodeficiency virus infection . Receipt history receipt medication treatment affect immune system , immune globulin , interferon , immunomodulators , cytotoxic drug drug know frequently associate significant major organ toxicity since six month prior first HPV vaccine dose . Receipt longterm ( great equal 2 week ) potentially immunosuppressive corticosteroid use within six month anticipate receipt study period . Specifically , potentially immunosuppressive corticosteroid parenteral corticosteroid , high dose ( &gt; 800 mcg/day ) beclomethasone dipropionate equivalent medication ; nasal topical steroid allow . Current former participation HPV vaccine relate research . Receipt investigational alternate ( Cervarix ) HPV vaccine . Receipt live virus vaccine ( varicella virus vaccine , measles , mumps , rubella virus vaccine , yellow fever vaccine include live attenuate influenza virus vaccine ) within 4 week 3rd dose HPV vaccine anticipate receipt live virus vaccine within 4 week 3rd dose HPV vaccine . However , subject may receive vaccine day third dose HPV . Parent/legal guardian exclusion criterion : If site actively recruit adolescent clinic population , survey health literacy assessment available parents/legal guardian clinic population . Therefore ask participate study . At site administer survey health literacy assessment , parents/legal guardian meet follow exclusion criterion baseline exclude fill study questionnaire examine factor associate adherence : History physical , mental developmental disorder study personnel believe may hinder participant 's ability comply study requirement .</criteria>
