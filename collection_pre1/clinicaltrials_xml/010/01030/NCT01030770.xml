	<brief_summary>This study enrol patient diabetes already elect undergo par plana vitrectomy ( eye surgery ) remove persistent vitreous haemorrhage ( complication severe diabetic eye disease blood fill inner cavity eye , obscure vision prevent treatment stop bleeding ) . Those treatment arm intravitreal injection ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) dose use treatment neovascular ( wet ) age-related macular degeneration ( disease feature common diabetic eye disease ) . It hypothesise promote clearance vitreous haemorrhage , turn , may mean patient need proceed vitrectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The eye design like camera , lens front film back . Using analogy , retina film camera vitreous space lens retina . Light focus lens fall retina creates image outside world transmit brain . Within retina small blood vessel supply nutrition . Sometimes eye disease diabetes blood vessel grow abnormal new branch ( stimulated growth factor VEGF ) leave retina grow vitreous space . Because new vessel fragile tendency get damage bleed . When bleed vitreous space create large collection blood ( haemorrhage ) prevents focus light lens reach retina . This dramatically reduce vision eye patient prevents healthcare practitioner examine eye give treatment cause bleed . This often mean eye operation require clear blood vitreous space , allow patient see allow treatment prevent worsen eye disease . Diabetic retinopathy name give damage cause diabetes retina patient condition . It lead cause vision loss group patient mostly work age . Patients diabetes require regular eye examination look sign abnormal new vessel bleed vitreous . In severe form diabetic eye disease ( proliferative diabetic retinopathy ) laser therapy use treat back eye try prevent progression new proliferate blood vessel . However blood vessel bleed vitreous space , prevents examination retina ability provide preventative treatment patient . It often take many month haemorrhage clear , time patient leave without useful vision eye underlie disease continue worsen . It difficult situation eye operation ( vitrectomy ) require remove blood . Small , uncontrolled study intravitreal ( injection vitreous space eye ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) suggest agent enhances clearance diabetic vitreous haemorrhage ( 1,2,3 ) . Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody license treatment metastatic cancer . It work inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , chemical mediator promote new blood vessel growth within tumour . It use off-label ( without licence ) treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( nAMD - common eye disease loss vision ) , condition characterise intraocular new blood vessel growth ( neovascularisation ) . Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) another monoclonal antibody VEGF : directly cleave Bevacizumab produce low molecular weight molecular appropriate use inside eye . Whereas bevacizumab use off-label treat nAMD , ranibizumab subject large Phase III control clinical trial ( 4,5 ) robust safety analysis , license treatment nAMD Europe , USA , country . Neither bevacizumab ranibizumab license treatment diabetic retinopathy . If ranibizumab produce similar effect pilot study bevacizumab diabetic vitreous haemorrhage , ( 1,2,3 ) potential speed visual recovery reduce likelihood patient require surgery , attendant cost , patient inconvenience , operative risk . Whilst bevacizumab cheap alternative ranibizumab , yet extensive safety data . Further , bevacizumab prepare treat clinician intermediate pharmacy dosage appropriate intraocular use , whereas ranibizumab provide manufacturer pre-packaged sterile syringe contain dose design intraocular administration . The relative cost disparity likely reduce come year , single intravitreal injection small proportion total treatment cost proliferative diabetic retinopathy , consume considerable health care resource , particularly eye operation require . This study enrol patient already decide undergo eye operation ( par plana vitrectomy ) clear persistent diabetic vitreous haemorrhage . Those treatment arm intravitreal injection ranibizumab dose use nAMD . It hypothesise promote clearance vitreous haemorrhage , turn , may mean patient need proceed vitrectomy .</detailed_description>
