	<brief_summary>This pilot study randomize , placebo-controlled , clinical trial measure change blood urine level inositol premature infant high risk retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) follow repeat dos inositol . Based previous study , premise maintain inositol concentration similar occur naturally utero reduce rate ROP bronchopulmonary dysplasia premature infant . The objective evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety , clinical outcome multiple dos three different dose amount myo-inositol ( provide Abbott Laboratories ) low birth weight premature infant . This study enroll estimate 96 infant 17 NICHD Neonatal Research Network sit . Infants randomly assign receive either 10 mg/kg 5 % inositol , 40 mg/kg 5 % inositol , 80 mg/kg 5 % inositol , 5 % glucose give volume timing inositol dosage maintain masking . Enrollees receive assign dose placebo daily , start within 72 hour birth , continue reach 34 week post-menstrual age , 10 week chronologic age , time hospital discharge , whichever occur first . The study drug administer first intravenously ; infant progress full feeding , drug give enterally ( orally via feed tube ) . Enrollees see follow-up examination 18-22 month correct age . This pilot study preparation future Phase III multi-center randomize controlled trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) abnormal growth blood vessel eye occur primarily premature infant . Eye development occur normally womb ; infant bear prematurely , however , blood vessel must finish develop outside protective environment uterus . Retinopathy prematurity ( also know retrolental fibroplasia ) lead cause blindness vision impairment ( myopia , strabismus , amblyopia ) child , develop develop country . Inositol naturally-occurring sugar alcohol produce fetus placenta present high level fetal blood throughout pregnancy human animal . Serum level fall rapidly birth , although fall moderate infant receive breast milk fortify formula . Two randomized trial show intravenous inositol supplementation first week significantly reduce death , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , retinopathy . One study enteral supplement ( give orally via feed tube ) less convincing , also support reduction retinopathy . This pilot study evaluate change blood urine inositol level ( half-life pharmacokinetics ) multiple dose myo-inositol ( provide Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Nutrition Division ) give low birth weight infant . The premise maintain inositol concentration similar occur naturally utero reduce rate retinopathy bronchopulmonary dysplasia premature infant . Results study used select dose large multi-center trial . In study , 17 NICHD Neonatal Research Network sit enroll approximately 96 infant 12-72 hour age . Enrolled infant randomly assign receive either 10mg/kg 5 % inositol , 40 mg/kg 5 % inositol , 80 mg/kg 5 % inositol , 5 % glucose give volume timing inositol dosage maintain masking . Inositol administer intravenously baby feed normally , time dose formulation administer enterally ( orally via feed tube ) . Concentrations inositol measure blood , urine , milk receive . Stratification : Recruitment stratify gestational age infant bear 23 0/7 26 6/7 week gestational age infant bear 27 0/7 29 6/7 week gestational age .</detailed_description>
