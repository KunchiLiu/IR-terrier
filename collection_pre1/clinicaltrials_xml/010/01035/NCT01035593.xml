	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety , tolerability , efficacy rhC1INH renal transplant recipient biopsy-confirmed antibody-mediated rejection ( AMR ) within 30 day renal transplantation . This study combine investigational drug rhC1INH standard regimen plasmapheresis ( PP ) intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ) compare PP IVIG alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Investigator-initiated , prospective , open-label , randomize , adaptive design study enroll 30 adult renal transplant recipient biopsy-confirmed AMR within 30 day post transplantation . After informed consent obtain study eligibility confirm , subject enrol immediately biopsy confirmation AMR positive donor specific antibody ( DSA ) . Subjects randomized one two treatment group ( SOC [ control ] rhC1INH ) . An initial cohort 8 subject ( 3 SOC , 5 rhC1INH ) receive intensive safety monitor coagulation system thromboembolic event .</detailed_description>
