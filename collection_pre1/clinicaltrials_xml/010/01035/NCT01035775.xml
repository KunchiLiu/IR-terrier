	<brief_title>Does Inspection During Insertion Improve Adenoma Yields During Colonoscopy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Colonoscopy perfect test . It miss substantial number neoplastic lesion risk miss cancer . Nearly work detection colonoscopy focus withdrawal phase examination . Thus , colonoscopy typically perform rapidly pass instrument loop bend colon order reach tip cecum , perform slow withdrawal tip instrument systematically deflect , mucosa careful clean suction , expose colonic mucosa view . Many experienced colonoscopists recognize small polyp see incidentally remove insertion sometimes quite difficult find withdrawal . The reason observation probably colon different anatomical conformation endoscope insertion withdrawal . During insertion , colon natural conformation sigmoid transverse colon several sharp bend flexure , overall length yet shorten . In phase , colon often significantly stretch formation loop bend colonoscope . This greatly affect conformation colonic wall visualize proximal instrument tip . During withdrawal , colon shorten pleated colonoscope , successive region colon inspect slip end instrument . Thus , segment visualize colon often much straight withdrawal insertion . The insertion withdrawal phase , therefore , expose somewhat different section mucosal surface colonoscope inspection insertion withdrawal , quite possibly , complementary . Aims : This randomize , control trial compare additional effect rate adenoma detection mucosal inspection colonoscope insertion , inspection instrument withdrawal , patient undergo colonoscopy colorectal cancer screen surveillance . Study procedure : In study , plan investigate whether specify interval inspection insertion increase overall adenoma detection . We conduct randomize controlled trial , patient randomize inspection perform withdrawal phase ( usual care ) versus several minute examination specifically devote inspection insertion .</detailed_description>
