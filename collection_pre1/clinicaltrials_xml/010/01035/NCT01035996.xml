	<brief_summary>Background : - Schizophrenia associate cognitive impairment different part brain , include associate learning memory . The brain activity associate impairment , however , poorly understood . Researchers interested study brain chemical dopamine , involve respond incentive reward like money food , work differently brain people schizophrenia . Objectives : - To study reward processing individual schizophrenia take different type medication , compare healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age ( ) diagnose schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder take antipsychotic medication clozapine , ( b ) , diagnose schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder take different second-generation antipsychotic , ( c ) healthy volunteer . Design : - This study involve one screen visit one visit test functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan . During screen visit , participant complete questionnaire provide information physical psychological health . - Participants receive training task perform scan session screen visit . - During fMRI scan , participant complete one two four possible reward-based task : - A task enable participant win money base response target item . - A task provide small amount juice specific time interval , follow procedure complete outside scanner . - A task involve choose figure shape win money base response . - A game chance involve prediction base shape show screen . - Participants also provide blood sample research testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Schizophrenia ( SC ) associate cognitive impairment variety domain , include learn memory . The neural underpinnings cognitive deficit , however , poorly understood . Based evidence abnormal functioning brain dopamine ( DA ) system implicate schizophrenia mechanism reinforcement processing , propose test theory functional role dopamine schizophrenia . Specifically , study describe test two main idea DA function possible contribution SC : 1 ) role facilitate learn cue-reward association ; 2 ) role signal mismatch expect experienced outcome ( call prediction error ) . Study Population : In order ass brain response outcomes , cue predictive outcome , enroll 135 total participant ( SC patient control ) , age 18 - 55 . For first set experiment , enrol 54 total subject ( 37 SCs 17 control ) achieve 34 total completers ( 24 SCs 10 control ) . In second set experiment , goal examine two type SC patient ( take clozapine take different second-generation antipsychotic ) . For experiment , enroll 81 total subject ( 27 control , 27 SCs take clozapine , 27 SCs take different second-generation antipsychotic ) achieve approximately 47 total completers ( 15 control , 16 SCs take clozapine , 16 SCs take different second-generation antipsychotic ) . Design : We measure brain activity use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , conjunction performance reinforcement processing task literature . These paradigms involve either passive observation reinforcement contingency , requirement make appropriate response within time window order earn positive feedback . The ongoing study use two specific paradigm : one examine impact brain response feedback subsequent learning , one investigating brain response monetary reinforcer modulate unexpectedness event . Outcome Measures : In current study , investigate difference MRI responses outcome SC patient control , subgroup patient . In particular , interested determine whether MRI responses component reward circuit , midbrain , basal ganglion , orbitofrontal cortex , attenuate SC patient , context paradigm require individual detect mismatch expect experienced outcome , modify response base mismatch . We hypothesize learn deficit SC stem primarily impairment signal error reward prediction , abnormality signal error reward prediction reflect abnormal stimulus-evoked activation primarily two brain area SC patient ( DA target area ) : prefrontal cortex neostriatum . We predict signal relate systematically performance reinforcement-learning task .</detailed_description>

Must 4 week stable pharmacological treatment ( medication dose ) . Individuals eligible participation one propose experimental group condition : EXCLUSION CRIERIA : Participants MRI scan experiements All participant MRI scan experiements undergo standard screen clinical policy IRP : All Participants MRI scan experiment Participants experimental group exclude participation : 1 . Are unable undergo MRI scan due pregnancy ( via pregnancy test ) , implant attach metallic device ( e.g . cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator ; artificial joint metal pin ; surgical clip ; brace ; implant metal part ) , claustrophobia , syncope , selfreport ; 2 . Show current evidence severe hypertension , indicate blood pressure measurement 190 systolic 110 diastolic two separate occasion . Potential participant evidence chronic and/or poorly control hypertension may exclude MRP even measurements value ; 3 . Show current evidence diabetes , indicate blood sugar measurement 300 mg/dl . Potential participant evidence chronic and/or poorly control diabetes may exclude MRP even measurements value ; 4 . Suffer HIV infection , coagulopathies , major medical illness , judgment MRP , would seriously compromise quality data gather ; 5 . Have neurological illness would interfere quality neuroimaging data gather , i.e . include ( limited ) : seizure disorder ; migraine ; multiple sclerosis ; movement disorder ; history head trauma , CVA , CNS tumor ; 6 . Are notably cognitively impaired history observation ; 7 . Have DSMIV diagnosis past alcohol substance dependence ( exception nicotine ) ; 8 . Test positively 7 common ban substance time screen ; 9 . Are lactate , hormonal fluctuation associate lactation may interact dopamine system function . Normal , Healthy Control Participants In addition exclusion criterion already outline , control participant also exclude : 1 . Have current , previous , diagnosis major psychiatric disorder , i.e . include ( limited ) mood , anxiety , psychiatric disorder , substanceinduced psychiatric disorder . 2 . Have firstdegree relative history psychosis likely relate schizophrenia , bipolar affective disorder , schizoaffective disorder . 3 . Have previously diagnose DSMIV Axis II spectrum disorder . Patient Participants Patient patient exclude meet criterion already outline , also : 1 . Have experience change pharmacological treatment dose 4 week precede study enrollment . 2 . We exclude patient whose paranoid ideation might prevent feel comfortable task scanningenvironment .</criteria>
