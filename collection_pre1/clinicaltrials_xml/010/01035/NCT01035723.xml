	<brief_summary>Background : - New research genetics human genome help identify certain gene affect specific part brain , include part may involve drug use dependency . Researchers interested study genetic information brain activity well understand variation brain function among individual . Objectives : - To study brain activity conjunction specific genetic information provide healthy volunteer include smoker , non-smokers , people drug dependence , dependence substance . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age . Design : - This 8 10 hour study may complete 1 , 2 , 3 visit . - Participants complete questionnaire emotional psychological response different situation , include stressful situation . - Participants train session mock ( fake ) scanner practice task complete real scanner . - Participants follow two type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan one scan session brain : - A structural MRI scan provide basic information participant 's brain . - A functional MRI scanning session , participant perform memory task provide information brain activity . - Participants provide blood sample research testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Functional genetic polymorphism identify influence morphology function brain region implicate addictive neuropsychiatric disorder . This protocol aim integrate genotyping structural functional brain image investigate impact specific functional polymorphism morphology function amygdala hippocampus behavior mediate brain region . Functional polymorphism BDNF , SLC6A4 , DISC1 gene study , logical candidate influence variability brain morphology function . The overall hypothesis variation morphology function amygdala hippocampus explain , least part , specific genotype difference . Study Population : The study population consist healthy male female adult volunteer ( 18-50 year old ) . Design : After medically clear give write informed consent , participant undergo structural MRI scan brain use volumetric measurement amygdala , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex , intracranial cavity . Each participant undergo fMRI scan session , include emotional context memory task specifically design require function amygdala hippocampus . A venous blood sample collect genotyping BDNF , SLC6A4 , DISC1 polymorphism . Additionally , functional polymorphism may influence brain structure may also evaluate , exploratory fashion . If participant already blood sample collect genetics portion another Neuroimaging Research Branch study , may need another sample take . Outcome Measures : This protocol provide direct benefit research participant . Understanding relationship genetic polymorphism brain morphology association brain function behavior may provide clue neurobiological mechanism underlie addictive neuropsychiatric disorder . The potential risk relate acquire MRI scan general . Medical supervision provide throughout study .</detailed_description>
