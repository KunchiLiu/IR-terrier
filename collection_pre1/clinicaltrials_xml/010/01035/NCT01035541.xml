	<brief_summary>This study design compare renal outcome patient follow major non-cardiac surgery different perioperative hemodynamic management : goal direct hemodynamic management group ( use PiCCO ) control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Goal Directed Hemodynamic Management Renal Outcome After Major Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common complication major surgery . Many study show AKI associate different complication : high mortality , renal replacement therapy prolong hospital stay result high health care cost . Until study publish prevention therapy AKI major surgery . Most investigation underpowered show marginal benefit . There study publish investigate impact goal-directed hemodynamic management renal outcome follow non-cardiac major surgery , even though hemodynamic stability seem paramount importance kidney . Aim study investigate impact goal direct hemodynamic management renal outcome major non-cardiac surgery . Therefore patient randomize one two group , PiCCO group goal direct hemodynamic management Control group , PICCO data collect influence hemodynamic management . In group monitor transpulmonary thermodilution continue intensive care unit 72 hour surgery .</detailed_description>
