	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give combination chemotherapy without rituximab stem cell transplant see well work treat patient persistent recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma resistant chemotherapy . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy After Combination Chemotherapy With Without Rituximab Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma That Resistant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Lenalidomide give post transplant set 12 month maintenance period . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary estimate 1-year response rate , event-free overall survival use regimen . OUTLINE : This phase I dose escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . PRE-CONDITIONING ( patient CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma ) : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) per standard care . PREPARATIVE REGIMEN : Patients receive carmustine IV day -6 , etoposide IV twice daily ( BID ) cytarabine IV BID day -5 -2 , melphalan IV day -1 . AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION : Patients undergo stem cell infusion day 0 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning approximately 100 day post-transplant , patient receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
