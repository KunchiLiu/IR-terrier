	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Previously Enrolled Clinical Trial POG-9421</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To profile basal potentiate phospho-protein network ( PPPNs ) use tissue sample pediatric patient de novo acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) previously enrol clinical trial POG-9421 . - To classify AML-based signal transduction mechanism . - To correlate profile basal PPPNs specific molecular lesion ( e.g. , FLT3-ITD , NPM , WT1 , c-kit , CEPBα , PASGΔ75 , karyotype ) profile gene expression tumor tissue sample . OUTLINE : Banked tissue sample collect laboratory study , include phospho-protein signal gene expression profile study .</detailed_description>
