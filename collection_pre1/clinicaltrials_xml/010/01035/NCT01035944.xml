	<brief_title>Chitosan Dressings Facilitate Safe Effective Debridement Chronic Wounds &amp; Minimize Wound Bacterial Re-colonization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : There two primary objective : 1 . To demonstrate debridement perform use HemCon dressing bedside perform safely without excessive bleeding eligible patient 2 . To compare level bacterial load debrided wound treated HemCon dressing debrided wound treat gauze saline dressing 2 day 5 day debridement Secondary objective : The follow secondary objective achieve study : 1 . To determine cost efficacy , , wound debrided bedside HemCon dress wound debrided operating room set 2 . To determine cost efficacy , , wound debrided operating room hemostasis achieve HemCon dress debrided wound hemostasis achieve traditional cauterization method . 3 . To compare comfort level patient treat HemCon dressing compare traditional gauze dressing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year able provide write informed consent . Have wind body eschar and/or significant slough present Documented laboratory study coagulation profile prior debridement ( include hematocrit , hemoglobin , white blood count , total lymphocyte count , albumin , prealbumin , HbA1C patient diabetes ) Subjects hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL must one unit blood type cross match prior debridement ; subject must active type screen perform prior debridement procedure . Subjects must willing consent blood transfusion rare event transfusion necessary . Must expect inpatient least 5 day follow debridement , enable control dress change service . Female subject childbearing age must pregnant , must consent utilize appropriate method contraception course study . For subject undergo debridement operate room : Subjects must sensate wound sufficiently large warrant debridement OR Wounds must require simple eschar removal , must extensive enough operating room debridement would appropriate . Subjects must candidate regional general anesthesia , unless wound occur insensate body part ( example , pressure sore paraplegic quadriplegic patient , diabetic foot ulcer patient dense diabetic polyneuropathy ) . For subject undergo debridement bedside setting : The part wound debrided must mostly eschar necrotic tissue likely significant bleeding . Subjects must insensate , wind must less 50 cm2 use local anesthesia wound undertaken . Predebridement hemoglobin level &lt; 7.0 g/dL Not candidate refuse blood transfusion Unable provide write informed consent Subjects sensitivity chitosan gauze dressing use study , local anesthetic need debridement Subjects intensive care unit Subjects , opinion Investigator , may complete study reason . Have grossly infect wound may reasonably expect require multiple debridement procedure prior clearance bacteria nonviable tissue wound . For wound situate low extremity , leg must either palpable pulse else ABI &gt; 0.4</criteria>
