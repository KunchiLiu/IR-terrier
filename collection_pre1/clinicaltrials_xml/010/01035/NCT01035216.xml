	<brief_title>A Phase I Study GNKG168 Patient With Relapsed Refractory B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( B-CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose escalation study design characterize safety , tolerability , efficacy , pharmacokinetics GNKG168 patient B-CLL relapse refractory prior standard therapy , standard therapy exist . As secondary objective , baseline TLR-9 intracellular stain B-CLL cell , vitro assay assess potential B-CLL cell undergo apoptosis conjunction GNKG168 therapy examine . Baseline characteristic B-CLL examine include interphase genetics , FISH CLL , IgVH mutational status , expression ZAP70 , β2-microglobulin expression prognostic marker CD38 peripheral blood cell ( baseline treatment ) baseline immune SNPs ( FcγRIIIa , FcγRIIa , TNF-α , IFN-γ , CD40 others ) . As pharmacodynamics parameter , expression B-cell T-cell activation marker ( include IL-21 receptor upregulation ) , NK cell marker , cytokine investigate . This clinical trial also assess ability B CLL patient treat GNKG168 elicit anti pneumococcal antibody response adjuvant vaccination Prevnar™ vaccine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients cytologically confirm Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( BCLL ) relapse refractory prior standard therapy , standard therapy exists , patient refuse available therapy . 2 . Patients ' BCLL must stag accord either Rai Binet systems23 ( see Appendix III ) assess chromosomal abnormality , unmutated IgVH status , expression ZAP70 , expression CD38 ( see Section 7.2 Pretreatment ) . 3 . Patients must recover acute adverse effect prior therapy grade 1 , exclude alopecia . 4 . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 . 5 . Patients must ≤ 18 year age . 6 . Patients must normal organ function define : total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . The creatinine clearance male patient may calculate use CockcroftGault formula : CrCl ( mL/min ) = [ ( 140 age ) x weight ( kg ) ] / 72 x Cr ( mg/dL ) . Note : female patient , calculation must multiply factor 0.85 . 7 . Patients must serum sodium level ≥ 135 mmol/L serum chloride level ≥ 98 mmol/L . 8 . Male patient must QTc interval &lt; 450 msec female patient must QTc interval &lt; 470 msec . 9 . Patients must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . 10 . Patients must least 2 week prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , major surgery , investigational anticancer therapy . Patients may receive steroid control secondary effect CLL autoimmune cytopenia painful lymph node consider treat physician best interest patient . 11 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior begin treatment study . Male female patient must use acceptable contraceptive method entire study period 1 month end study discontinue study . 1 . Patients currently receive chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biological therapy , investigational therapy . 2 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse effect due agent administer 4 week earlier . 3 . Patients uncontrolled know leukemic meningitis , poor prognosis likelihood develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 4 . Patients history sensitivity allergy attribute compound similar chemical composition GNKG168 Prevnar™ vaccine . 5 . Patients concurrent serious infection ( i.e. , require intravenous antibiotic ) . 6 . Patients active malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) may limit survival less 2 year . 7 . Patients preexist autoimmune disease ( i.e . systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , thyroiditis , scleroderma , etc . ) eligible . 8 . Women pregnant childbearing potential use method avoid pregnancy , woman breastfeed . 9 . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , unstable angina pectoris psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . Patients significant cardiac disease include heart failure meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV definition , history myocardial infarction within six month study entry , uncontrolled dysrhythmias poorly control angina . 11 . Patients know positive status HIV active hepatitis B hepatitis C. 12 . Patients medical condition opinion Investigator place unacceptably high risk toxicity .</criteria>
