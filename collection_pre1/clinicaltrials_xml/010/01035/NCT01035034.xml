	<brief_title>Comparison One-stop Hybrid Revascularization Versus Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Treatment Multi-vessel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale purpose study : `` One-stop '' ( also name simultaneous ) hybrid coronary revascularization emerge novel , safe feasible minimally invasive approach select patient multivessel coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The benefit `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure compare conventional PCI unclear , however . This study single center randomize clinical trial compare safety efficacy `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure conventional PCI treatment select patient multivessel CAD require revascularization suitable coronary anatomy . Sample size : We examine result SYNTAX trial hybrid procedure publish previously . The 1-year MACCE rate ( primary endpoint ) estimate 18 % PCI/stenting 8 % hybrid group . The sample calculate trial 480 patient . Design/Methodology : Trial design : A single center randomize clinical trial compare `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure versus conventional PCI SES 480 patient suitable anatomy need revascularization . Intervention : Patients randomize undergo either `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure conventional PCI SES . Randomization : Patients evaluate cardiac surgeon interventional cardiologist . After obtain informed write consent , patient randomize receive `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure conventional PCI SES . An expertise-based randomization use . The data adjudicator blind study . Due nature study , operate surgeon , cardiologist , anesthetist , operative room staff , ICU staff blind study . Study intervention : Candidates randomize receive `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure conventional PCI .</detailed_description>
