	<brief_summary>Confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) novel highly promise image method allow vivo image mucosal layer resolution approximately 1 micron . Cellular sub-cellular structure well capillary single red blood cell visualize . CLE well establish highly accurate method distinguish neoplasia gastrointestinal tract lumen via endoscopy . A major new breakthrough development sub-millimeter CLE probe pass via image guide needle ( nCLE ) solid organ cyst . It hypothesize nCLE help distinguish benign , premalignant malignant cystic lesion pancreas visualize cellular lining cyst , thereby , avoid unnecessary surgery patient benign cyst guide early effective surgical removal high risk neoplastic lesion . A prototype minimal risk nCLE system develop pass via standard endoscopic ultrasound needle pancreas FDA clearance vivo use expect late 2010 . The investigator propose evaluate prototype nCLE system vivo endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) , initial pilot study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : confocal laser endomicroscopy image nCLE differentiate non-mucinous , mucinous non- malignant malignant pancreatic cyst vivo increase sensitivity compare endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) tissue sample . In pilot study investigator primarily evaluate technical feasibility interobserver agreement . 1 . In patient undergo EUS suspect pancreatic cyst , investigator evaluate key nCLE image feature non mucinous , mucinous , malignant pancreatic cystic neoplasm ( PCN ) . 2 . The investigator estimate initial image quality , feasibility , interobserver agreement nCLE 3 . The investigator establish preliminary accuracy nCLE use plan large comparative trial</detailed_description>
