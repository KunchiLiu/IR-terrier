	<brief_summary>Background : - Relapse follow cigarette abstinence remain common problem smoker attempt quit . Most research focus acute withdrawal phase occur within first 48 hour 1 week quitting ; however , information need experience smoker longer duration abstinence . Objectives : - To study effect long-term smoking abstinence . - To study effect cigarette-related cue crave long period smoke abstinence . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age current smoker ( least 10 cigarette per day ) want quit currently attempt quit . Design : - Participants randomly assign abstain nicotine use 7 , 14 , 35 day . A fourth group participant also abstain 35 day , undergo test session group . - All participant initial orientation session complete questionnaire smoke habit respond smoking-related cue provide information craving . - Participants visit clinic daily abstinence period , provide urine breath sample test tobacco use . Participants receive compensation every day use tobacco . - On end day abstinence period , participant return clinic , provide urine breath sample , undergo test response smoking-related cue . Participants fourth group test Days 7 , 14 , 35 abstinence ; participant test , end abstinence period . - After require abstinence period , participant enter 5-day step-down period . They continue report clinic breath urine testing , receive payment abstinence decrease value across day . - After step-down period , final 12 day study , participant report clinic every 3 day give urine breath sample report number cigarette smoke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Relapse follow cigarette abstinence remain common problem smoker attempt quit . Extensive research focus acute withdrawal phase occur within first 48 hour one week ; however , study focus longer duration abstinence . Current clinical wisdom suggest rate relapse decrease length abstinence increase ; however , animal study indicate reactivity drug-related cue actually increase time , effect study human . Scientific Goal To examine time course cue reactivity smoker abstinent 7 , 14 , 35 day . Participant Population A total 420 smoker plan quit future , right , willing undergo practice quit attempt . Target enrollment include 50 % woman 50 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . Experimental Design Methods Smokers ( N=420 ) participate one 4 group period 24 52 day session conduct National Institute Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program 251 Bayview Blvd , Suite 200 , Baltimore , MD 21224 , separately approve site , Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory ( HBPL , L484-496 , 5841 S. Maryland Ave. , Chicago , IL , 60637 ) . We expect 190 participant successfully complete withdrawal phase ( N=50 group 1 , 2 , 3a , N=40 group 3b ) . Participants randomly assign abstain nicotine use 7 , 14 , 35 day participate one cue-reactivity session day last day abstinence ( group 1 , 2 , 3a ; N=50 per condition ) . The cue-presentation task involve visual , olfactory , tactile cue . After cue presentation , participant complete Brief Questionnaire Smoking Urges standardize mood questionnaire . Physiological response auditory reaction time obtain . Group 3b ( N=40 ) also abstain 35 day , complete cue-reactivity task two additional time provide within-study examination change cue reactivity long period abstinence . On laboratory visit , participant give urine sample test cotinine breath sample test carbon monoxide ( CO ) verify abstinence smoking . Participants receive $ 20 cash test negative , accumulate $ 10 pay bonus end abstinence phase . After required abstinence period 7 , 14 , 35 day , participant enter five-day step-down period continue report laboratory 10 min day , receive payment abstinence descend value across day . One primary outcome measure study time return smoking , begin last day require abstinence . After step-down period , final 12 day study , volunteer report lab every 3 day give urine breath sample report number cigarette smoke . Participants receive $ 15 visit laboratory , receive end-of-study bonus $ 25 attend visit . This money pay regardless whether abstain smoking . Benefits Participants and/or Society There direct benefit participant . These study provide basis future study investigate relapse drug use . They also shed light role cue reactivity impulsivity relapse . Knowledge time course relapse provide important information process underlying drug use relapse . Risks Participants The risk participant minimal . Participants healthy cigarette smoker abstain smoke vary period time may increase crave end experimental cue-exposure session . They give guide relaxation end session reduce crave pre-session level fully debrief follow study . Some participant experience depression adverse symptom nicotine withdrawal . These fully describe participant , , symptoms become severe , psychologist/counselor counsel participant . The risk involve loss confidentiality information obtain screening .</detailed_description>
