	<criteria>Women already undergone breast physical examination , mammography within three month MR study , study , mammography MR examination . Women palpable mammographicallydetected suspect breast lesion without breast implant image . Women high risk breast cancer may also include since woman commonly require breast MRI screening . Since patient may recent coreneedle biopsy may recent postneedle biopsy change plan followup mastectomy excision biopsy site ( complete reexcision ) , include group . This allow u obtain broad spectrum postneedle biopsy finding since common procedure use prior biopsy evaluate patient potential cancer multicentricity multifocality . Women already undergone lumpectomy breast cancer postbiopsy/postradiation change eligible mammographicallydetected palpable breast abnormality sufficiently suspicious merit core needle surgical biopsy . The low incidence male breast cancer preclude significant participation men program men exclude . Patients must able complete MR examination . Subjects interviewed one investigator usual contraindication MR include pacemaker , metallic implant , severe claustrophobia , aneurysm clip , pregnancy , current lactation , condition preclude proximity strong magnetic field . These patient exclude contraindication present . Other patient exclude MR study enhance MR procedure within 48 hour , iodinate contrast within six hour , know sensitivity MR contrast agent , likely complete study full another clinical reason would preclude participation protocol .</criteria>
