	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS : Early prophylactic inhalation Budesonide reduce absolute risk develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) death preterm infant bear &lt; 28 week gestational age ( GA ) 10 % . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To determine whether inhalation Budesonide within 12 hour life improve survival without BPD 36 week GA infant bear 23 27 week GA . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : To determine whether prophylactic inhalation Budesonide affect neurodevelopment correct age 18-22 month preterm infant ; determine whether inhalation corticosteroid associate adverse treatment effect , alters mortality 36 week GA , BPD incidence 36 week GA , duration positive pressure respiratory support supplemental oxygen . RATIONALE : Pre- postnatal exposure develop lung inflammation central development BPD pulmonary inflammatory response preterms risk develop BPD establish early life . Corticosteroids antiinflammatory property early inhalation corticosteroid may allow beneficial local effect pulmonary system prior development full inflammatory response low risk undesirable systemic side effect . STUDY DESIGN : Randomised placebo-controlled , multi-centre clinical trial . RESEARCH PLAN : Within 2 year 850 infant 23-27 week GA randomise first 12 hour life Budesonide placebo prevent BPD . Study drug administer via Aerochamber continue infant either supplementary oxygen positive pressure support reach GA 32 0/7 week regardless ventilatory status . The primary outcome survival without BPD determine 36 week GA BPD define accord physiological definition . Study patient follow neurodevelopmental outcome assess correct age 18-22 month . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : BPD contribute mortality preterm infant also associate impaired neurosensory development Extremely Low Birth Weight ( ELBW ) survivor , frequent readmission hospital first 2 year life , well increase risk asthma , lung function abnormality persistent respiratory symptom adolescence young adulthood . Systemic corticosteroid effective prevent BPD , use practically prohibit give adverse effect neurodevelopment . Early inhalation corticosteroid show associated secondary pulmonary benefit , effect survival without BPD neurodevelopment remain unclear .</brief_summary>
