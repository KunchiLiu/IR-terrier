	<brief_title>Behavioral Study Control Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According National Health Nutrition Examination Survey , 31 % adult U.S. population hypertension ( HTN ) . HTN major risk factor heart disease stroke , 1st 3rd leading cause death U.S. impose enormous financial social burden Americans $ 352 billion spent direct indirect cost . Behavioral intervention control blood pressure ( BP ) exhibit , average , positive relatively modest effect blood pressure control . We others study effect one intervention - home BP monitoring - BP control hypertensive patient , find reliable , albeit modest effect . We find similar effect another behavioral intervention , Motivational Interviewing , BP control . We hypothesize effect intervention augment accompanied systematic approach patient education concern illness treatment . The literature suggest patient education `` necessary sufficient '' ( implicit interaction ) produce behavioral change ; however , `` necessary '' part tend ignored interventionalists . The implication interaction patient lack necessary knowledge , intervention likely less effective ( value multiply zero - i.e. , knowledge - zero ) . In spite , find trial test interaction patient knowledge lifestyle drug intervention . We propose test intervention increase patient ' understanding cause , consequence , rationale treatment , HTN , strategy increase BP control . The focus interaction behavioral intervention reduce BP - home BP monitoring ( HBPM ) - patient knowledge , , propose , moderate effect HBPM intervention . We hypothesize patient well understand illness prescribed treatment adherent treatment regimen , thus exhibit improved outcome compare exposed intervention , clear understanding element . We propose pilot test effect HBPM intervention use 2 X 2 independent group randomize design , allow u compare effect Usual Care ( UC ) + Printed Materials ( PM ) compare Usual Care ( UC ) Self-Paced Programmed Instruction ( SPPI ) compare Home Blood Pressure Monitoring ( HBPM ) + Printed Materials ( PM ) compare Home Blood Pressure Monitoring ( HBPM ) + Self-Paced Programmed Instruction ( SPPI ) . Our primary hypothesis : Decreased ABP 3 month order thusly : HBPM+SPPI &gt; HBPM+PM &gt; UC+SPPI &gt; UC+PM</detailed_description>
