	<brief_summary>The field secondary prevention remain extremely important goal diagnostic therapeutic approach keep mind 40 % patient acute myocardial infarction prediabetes , commonly impair glucose tolerance , know treated guideline treatment . In context , accumulate evidence show beneficial effect treat diabetes mellitus early course disease , whereas evidence show aggressive antidiabetic therapy may associate undesired risk . Accordingly , present randomize control pilot study design hypothesis create study create first data potential medication early type 2 diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance patient know coronary artery disease mean secondary prevention compare oral antidiabetic therapy metformin insulin glargine o.d . study respective effect cardiovascular function metabolism fast state standardize meal . As diastolic myocardial function emerge important prognosticator , hypothesis test treatment insulin glargine improve myocardial function patient coronary artery disease newly diagnose type 2 diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre , short term ( 24 week ) , therapy control randomize prospective study blind analysis ultrasound data 28 patient know coronary artery disease , normal systolic cardiac function newly diagnose type 2 diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance treat ≤1 oral antidiabetic medication . After recruitment informed consent , patient randomize two treatment arm take account age presence absence therapy statin . In one treatment arm , therapy base insulin glargine sc o.d. , treatment arm , therapy base oral metformin , 2000 mg daily . Both treatment arm titrate target fast glucose ≤110 mg/dl first 12 week . The patient insulin treatment arm instruct skill self-medication departmental diabetic teaching programme prior start study medication encourage keep record episode hypoglycemia throughout study.Outpatients visit metabolic control ultrasound assessment week 4 , 12 24 baseline associate life style instruction patient .</detailed_description>
