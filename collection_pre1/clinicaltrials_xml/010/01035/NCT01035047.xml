	<detailed_description>Despite spend $ 12 billion annually emergency evaluation chest pain US , 15 % admitted patient cardiac cause presenting symptom . Clinical decision unit ( CDUs ) improve resource utilization recommend care option American College Cardiology / American Heart Association , underutilized non-low risk chest pain patient due weakness traditional cardiac testing . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) sensitive specific ischemia , simultaneously assess cardiac function myocardial perfusion , could revolutionize diagnostic process intermediate risk patient chest pain . The superior accuracy CMR could decrease test invasive procedure . The high sensitivity ongoing ischemia could allow image parallel cardiac marker . As result , CMR could improve care emergency department ( ED ) patient intermediate risk chest pain . However , efficiency safety CMR extensively test CDU set . Primary Hypothesis : A CDU-CMR strategy reduce occurrence composite revascularization , re-hospitalization , recurrent cardiac test 90 day compare inpatient care strategy . Methods : Participants ( n=146 ) intermediate risk acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) recruit clinical trial Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center ( WFUBMC ) ED . Participants equally randomize CDU-CMR inpatient care . CDU-CMR participant undergo rest stress CMR image parallel serial cardiac marker . Inpatient care participant undergo serial cardiac marker follow exist cardiac testing determine care provider . The primary outcome composite 90 day revascularization , re-hospitalization , recurrent cardiac testing . The secondary outcome index hospitalization length stay . Safety event include ACS discharge , mortality , stress testing-related adverse event .</detailed_description>
