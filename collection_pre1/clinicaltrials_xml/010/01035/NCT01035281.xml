	<detailed_description>This multicenter trial amongst 3 Western Canadian site compare efficacy nabilone versus placebo treat patient chronic neuropathic pain ( NeP ) due diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . A one-week screening period occur , pain score sleep score tabulate . Following screening , 4-week period single blind treatment nabilone 0.5 - 4 mg/day flexible dose take place . All subject begin nabilone therapy 1 mg daily minimum 4 day , dose study medication assess adjust either upwards downwards need balance efficacy pain control tolerability possible side effect . All subject experience least 30 % reduction weekly mean pain score single blind flexible dosing phase consider responder , continue study . Those fail achieve level pain relief discontinue study . Responders randomize 5 week double-blind treatment nabilone placebo . The double-blind phase study permit confirmation efficacy observe single-blind phase study . During double-blind portion study , subject randomize nabilone continue dose nabilone achieve completion single-blind phase , dose maintain throughout double-blind phase . Subjects randomize placebo receive direct switch placebo . All subject maintain pre-study dos analgesic medication pain control throughout study . There four total trial phase : 1 . Screening Phase This consist 7-day period time follow Visit 1 subject monitor satisfaction inclusion/exclusion criterion . If medication use treatment peripheral neuropathic pain , subject must stable dose ≥ 30 day prior enter single-blind phase ( Visit 2 ) . At end screen phase , subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion next enter single-blind phase . 2 . Single Blind Flexible Dose Nabilone Treatment Phase This 4 week ( 28 day ) treatment period subject take nabilone single-blind fashion , dose 1-4 mg per day . All subject start nabilone 0.5 mg po bid ( 1 mg daily ) least 4 day , study medication assess adjusted upwards , downwards , need achieve optimal NeP relief well side effect tolerability . Dosing adjustment occur maximum weekly , maximum dose 4 mg per day prevent increase dose , minimum dose 0.5 mg per day prevent decrease dose . At end single-blind phase , subject deem responder ( experience ≥ 30 % reduction weekly mean pain score ) randomize double-blind phase . Those subject responder enter taper phase study , end treatment assessment perform . Those patient receive dose 0.5 mg daily receive single capsule 0.5 mg qhs . In order prevent potential unmasking , patient intolerant placebo also placebo dose reduce 2 capsule daily one capsule daily . 3 . Double Blind Treatment Phase This 5 week ( 35 day ) treatment period subject deem responder single blind phase randomize double blind treatment dose nabilone achieve last week ( Visit 5 ) single-blind phase ( dose optimize NeP relief side effect tolerability ) placebo . Subjects randomize 1 2 treatment group 1:1 ratio , nabilone placebo respectively . Those subject randomize placebo directly switch active drug placebo duration study . All subject maintain pre-study dos analgesic medication pain control throughout study . No dose adjustment allow Week 4 onward . 4 . Taper Phase This one week ( 7 day ) period patient taper nabilone . All subject use nabilone dose adjust ( continue ) 0.5-1 mg nabilone daily . Any subject use placebo prior taper phase continue placebo taper phase . During single blind phase , dose nabilone may adjust upward 1 4 mg/day base tolerability weekly visits.. Any upward dose adjustment occur increment either 1 2 mg/day ( initial dose 1 mg 2 mg per day respectively ) . If intolerable adverse event occur time single blind dose adjustment phase , dose nabilone may decrease 0.5 , 1 2 mg/day ( initial dose 1 mg , 2 mg 4 mg per day respectively ) . A dose 0.5 mg per day tolerate lead study termination . Once dose reduction take place , dose adjustment permit . An unscheduled visit study week 3 study week 4 last opportunity dose adjustment . During double blind phase , subject must maintain dose regimen achieve end single blind dose adjustment phase end Week 8 ( Visit 7 ) . At time completion double blind phase , subject take nabilone taper study medication . All subject require attend minimum 8 visit person , one optional additional visit dose adjustment permit single blind phase . There total 9 clinic visit 3 telephone interview . Telephone interview occur week subject require attend clinic . The schedule visit telephone interview follow : - Screening ( begin Week [ -1 ] ) ( Visit 1 ) - Single Blind Dose Treatment - Day 0 ( Visit 2 ) - Single Blind Flexible Dose Treatment - Day 7 ( Visit 3 ) - Single Blind Flexible Dose Treatment - Day 14 ( Visit 4 ) - Telephone Interview - Day 21 - End Single Blind Flexible Dose Treatment Determination Responders , possible randomization Double Blind Phase - Day 28 ( Visit 5 ) - Double Blind Fixed Dose Treatment - Day 35 ( Visit 6 ) - Telephone Interview - Day 42 - Double Blind Fixed Dose Treatment - Day 49 ( Visit 7 ) - Telephone Interview - Day 56 - End Double Blind Fixed Dose Treatment - Day 63 ( Visit 8 ) - Follow-up Visit follow taper - Day 70 ( Visit 9 ) There optional dose adjustment period ( end Week 3 ) . The necessity unscheduled visit determine discretion investigator arrange telephone contact investigator subject If concern regard dose nabilone , adjustment permit time . If subject prematurely discontinue study stop study drug , end treatment assessment complete soon possible , give continue subject consent . All investigator aware study design subject treatment single-blind phase study . It important subject remain blinded nature treatment phase study . The subject treat time , active treatment nabilone . If subject becomes aware treatment type phase study , participation must discontinue .</detailed_description>
