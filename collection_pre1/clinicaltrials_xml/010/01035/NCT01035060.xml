	<brief_summary>Due rapid age population , sarcopenia among great challenge face health care system next quarter century . This age-related loss skeletal muscle mass strength directly contribute incidence functional disability , thereby reduce independence quality life elderly . Despite increase effort combat sarcopenia , etiology remain incompletely describe . Subsequently , limit progress make develop comprehensive preventative therapeutic strategy combat problem . A decreased ability regenerate skeletal muscle fiber donation skeletal muscle stem cell ( satellite cell ) think contribute sarcopenia . However , upstream physiological mediator regulate impairment poorly delineate . Reduced muscle blood flow advance age appear significant factor reduce skeletal muscle regenerative capacity , data exist confirm hypothesis . Thus test hypothesis aim conduct translational pilot trial examines regeneration young old adult . Furthermore , aim determine muscle blood flow satellite cell number associate muscle function . The central hypothesis proposal age-related decline skeletal muscle angiogenesis perfusion significant causal factor age-related loss skeletal muscle mass . The specific aim hypothesis project follow :</brief_summary>
