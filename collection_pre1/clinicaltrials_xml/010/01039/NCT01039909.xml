	<brief_summary>The main purpose study investigate effect SRT2104 upon energy production muscle ( specifically maximum amount energy produce muscle contraction ) , much sugar fat store muscle , size muscle receive 2.0 g SRT2104 placebo give capsule form day 28 day include 14 day knee low leg immobilisation period final 14 day dose . Imaging method , muscle biopsy exercise test use study see whether follow measurement change take SRT2104 28 day , include immobilised knee lower leg final 14 day dose . ) energy reach muscle ii ) muscle strength iii ) change structure muscle This study also investigate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability 2.0 g SRT2104 administer orally daily 28 consecutive day . The investigation pharmacokinetics SRT2104 allow u gather information regarding : ) long take drug absorb detect blood ii ) much detect iii ) long detect iv ) often need give drug maintain steady amount blood . SRT2104 give healthy subject age 18 40 year old . Subjects participate single centre study approximately 79 day . The study consist 11 outpatient clinic visit 4 telephone call ( include prescreen call determine whether subject interested participate ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Assess Effects SRT2104 Upon Immobilization-Induced Skeletal Muscle Atrophy Healthy Human Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants take part prospective , single center , randomize , double-blind , clinical study 2.0 g/day SRT2104 placebo ( test material ) administer orally 0.25 g capsule . The study evaluate effect 28 day consecutive SRT2104 dose upon muscle strength , metabolism structure ankle muscle group follow 14 day leg immobilization period . The study also evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter well safety tolerability 2.0 g/day SRT2104 . Thirty-four ( 34 ) healthy male female subject age 18-40 , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study . Subjects randomize 1:1 receive either 2.0 g/day SRT2104 placebo feed state 28 consecutive day . Subjects remain fixed dose test material dosing day study . Subjects provide write informed consent undergo screen assessment . If eligible willing participate , subject undergo baseline strength testing , muscle biopsy , MRI , MRS evaluation Day -1 ass muscle strength , metabolism . Participants commence 28 day dose period test material . On first day dose ( Day 1 ) , pharmacokinetic safety assessment perform . On Day 15 , subject complete 14 day dose test material , participant repeat muscle biopsy , strength testing , MRI evaluation , pharmacokinetic safety assessment . Following study assessment Day 15 , subject commence 14 day immobilization period . The leg dominant leg immobilize temporary removable brace , subject instruct ambulate use crutch duration immobilization period . Designated site staff contact subject via telephone Day 18 Day 24 check subject ' wellbeing ability function immobilize . Subjects report study site Day 21 14 day immobilization period assessment immobilize leg , include safety evaluation . On Day 28 , follow completion 14 day immobilization period , muscle biopsy , skeletal muscle evaluation , pharmacokinetic safety assessment perform . Subjects return clinic End Study visit 7 day ( +/- 2 day ) last dose test material follow safety assessment . A follow-up safety call make subject approximately 30 day follow final dose SRT2104 placebo .</detailed_description>
