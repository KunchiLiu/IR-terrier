	<brief_summary>Gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour ( GEP-NETs ) regard fairly rare disease . They derive neuroendocrine system gastrointestinal tract pancreas share common clinical feature . So far , still uncertainty cell biology mechanistic regulation tumour . Therefore target treatment limited management challenging . Treatment option include surgery , medical ablative therapy , recently peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy . In order well understand characteristic GEP-NETs evaluate treatment strategy , SwissNET registry aim collection data patient present GEP-NET Switzerland . Data enter prospectively anonymized specifically design database patient give informed consent . All hospital general practitioner invite report patient GEP-NET diagnosis participate registry . Data evaluate within regular time frame , focus type GEP-NETs , treatment modality patient outcome ( e.g . mortality , hospitalisation rate ) , thereby contribute well understanding tumour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour ( GEP-NETs ) generally classify rare disease . Little known cell biology mechanistic regulation . During last year , incidence GEP-NETs continuously increase worldwide . In parallel , novel treatment option currently evaluate may substantially improve prognosis patient NETs . Data tumour Switzerland , however , scarce treatment strategy vary throughout country . Objective To systematically prospectively collect clinical information patient GEP-NETs Switzerland base histologically confirm diagnosis . Methods All NETs , gastrointestinal pulmonary origin include provided patient give informed consent . Data enter prospectively anonymised specifically design database . Contributing centre general practitioner visit study nurse , patient file analyse data transfer database . In case conflict evidence , question resolve collaboration review board SwissNET . Evaluation treatment modality patient outcome ( e.g . mortality , hospitalisation rate ) take place within regular time frame .</detailed_description>
