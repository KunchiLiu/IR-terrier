	<brief_summary>Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) global disease responsible ~300,000 new cancer case year . Local recurrence ( ~30 % case ) formation second primary malignancy common.2 , 3 Cosmetic and/or functional compromise associate treatment disease stage often significant . These statistic underscore urgent need develop good approach order control deadly disease . It become increasingly apparent oral cancer develop within wide field diseased tissue characterize genetically altered cell widespread across oral cavity present clinically histologically normal oral mucosa . Complete removal lesion difficult high-risk change frequently go beyond clinically visible tumor . In recognition , current 'best practice ' remove SCC significant width ( usually 10 mm ) surround normal-looking oral mucosa . However , since occult disease varies size approach often result over-cutting ( cause severe cosmetic functional morbidity ) removal disease tissue , evidence frequent positive surgical margin high local regional recurrence - failure 'best practice . There wealth literature support use tissue autofluorescence screen diagnosis precancers lung , uterine cervix , skin oral cavity . This approach already clinical use lung mechanism action tissue autofluorescence well describe cervix . Changes fluorescence reflect complex interplay alteration fluorophores tissue structural change tissue morphology , associate progression disease . As one internationally leading team apply tissue fluorescence technology , show direct fluorescence visualization ( FV ) tool identify clinically visible occult premalignant malignant lesion associate lesion risk , high-grade histology high-risk molecular change . In recently small scale , retrospective study , show FV help surgeon operate room determine extent high-risk FV field surround cancer result remarkably low 2-year recurrence rate ( 0 % FV-guided vs. 25 % without FV-guided approach ) . There need design large scale prospective , randomize control ( Phase III ) trial gather strong evidence prove efficacy surgery approach use adjunct tool . To establish evidence support change clinical practice use FV-guided surgery . There 3 objective . 2.1 . Objective 1 ( Clinical evidence ) : To assess effect FV-guided surgery recurrence-free survival histologically confirm disease within context randomize control trial ( efficacy ) . Hypothesis : FV-guided surgery increase recurrence-free survival . 2.2 . Objective 2 ( Quality Life evidence ) : To establish cost per recurrence prevent approach ass quality life issue . Hypothesis : FV-guided surgery deliver cost effective manner improve quality life patient 2.3 Objective 3 ( Scientific/Molecular evidence ) : To assess presence previously validate molecular marker ( microsatellite analysis , LOH ) histological change ( quantitative pathology ) surgical margin nest case-control study involve tumor bank create within project . Hypothesis : FV-guided surgery spare normal tissue time improve capture high-risk tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.0 . OBJECTIVES AND APPROACHES : 1.1 . Objective 1 ( Clinical evidence ) : To assess effect FV-guided surgery recurrence-free survival histologically confirm disease within context randomize control trial ( efficacy ) . Hypothesis : FV-guided surgery increase recurrence-free survival . Approaches : This Aim require establishment randomize control trial 200 patient compare outcome patient 2 arm : one conventional surgery margin delineate white light , use FV guidance margin delineation . Please see attached Appendix 1 step-by-step protocol . This comprise multidisciplinary team surgeon , pathologist , project coordinator , FV Specialists . In addition presurgery assessment , participate patient 3-month follow-up first 2 year 6-month rest study period . Biopsy occur clinically warrant 2-year post-surgery . 1.2 . Objective 2 ( Quality Life evidence ) : To establish cost per recurrence prevent approach ass quality life issue . Hypothesis : FV-guided surgery deliver cost effective manner improve quality life patient . Approaches : This aim require collection economic quality life ( QoL ) data establish cost per recurrence prevent FV-guided surgery ass quality life impact . To asses potential psychosocial consequence FV-guided surgery measure global QoL . We use validated EQ-5D Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Head Neck Module ( FACT-H &amp; N ) determine participant 's QoL assessment . The questionnaire apply pre-surgery baseline , 6-week , 3-month , 24-month post-surgery follow-up . 1.3 Objective 3 ( Scientific/Molecular evidence ) : To assess presence previously validate molecular marker ( microsatellite analysis , LOH ) histological change ( quantitative pathology ) surgical margin nest case-control study involve tumor bank create within project . Hypothesis : FV-guided surgery spare normal tissue time improve capture high-risk tissue . Approaches : This Aim require retrieval cut archive material nest control study . The estimate number case reach outcome 30 ( 5 % FV group ( 100 ) + 25 % control group ( 100 ) . Additionally , 60 match control select ( matched gender , age , smoke habit , anatomical site ) . This Aim critical demonstrate shift field , spar normal tissue catch high-risk occult tissue . Samples nest molecular analysis perform Rosin 's Lab ( microsatellite analysis ) Cancer Imaging BC Cancer Agency ( Dr. MacAulay qualitative Pathology ) . The protocol use analyze sample publish . 2.0 . STUDY TOOL - VELSCOPE® We recently develop simple hand-held field-of-view device direct visualization tissue fluorescence oral cavity . This tool currently commercially available VELScope® ( LED Med Inc. , White Rock , BC ) . We begin longitudinal study explore effect FV define surgical margin outcome oral cancer surgery27 . Between 2004 2008 , 60 patient ≤4 cm oral cancer enter study . Each case treat surgical excision alone follow least 12 month . Thirty-eight patient FV-guided surgery , surgical margin place 10 mm beyond perimeter autofluorescence loss . The remain patient ( control group ) surgical margin place 10 mm beyond tumor edge define standard white-light examination . Among , 7 60 case ( 12 % ) develop recurrence severe dysplasia , carcinoma situ squamous cell carcinoma treat site , control group ( 25 % versus 0 % , P = 0.002 ) . These data suggest potential utility autofluorescence change within clinical setting . There need design large scale randomize controlled clinical trial confirm efficacy FV-guided surgery . We also use FV monitor potential re-emergence region autofluorescence loss treat sit case accrue longitudinal study currently complete interim assessment monitoring result . Autofluorescence loss persist case , increase size intensity time give rise clinical lesion contain dysplasia cancer . 3.0 Core member trial project management We well-built core group long-term strong work relationship , include surgeon ( Drs . Anderson ( Co-PI ) Durham ) , Pathologists ( Drs . Berean ( Co-PI ) Zhang ) , Oral Medicine ( Drs . Poh ( PI ) Williams ) , world-leading position use fluorescence visualization operate room follow-up . Dr. J. Lee , collaborator , M.D . Anderson Cancer Centre extensive experience clinical trial special expertise randomize control trial . He trialist project , design program patient randomization , oversee trial protocol , work local statistician ( Prof. Chen ) day-to-day data management . Professor Jiahua Chen , Department Statistics , University British Columbia serve biostatistician trial responsible data analysis submission interim analysis Data Safety Monitoring Board . 4.0 Basic trial design The propose study double-blinded , randomize control Phase III study evaluate effect FV-guided surgery patient diagnose severe dysplasia , carcinoma situ invasive squamous cell carcinoma undergo surgery treatment intent-to-cure . The trial randomize 200 patient -100 FV arm ( use FV guide surgery margin ) 100 control arm ( use conventional white light approach ) . The trial period 5 year - 2 year complete accrual 3 year follow-up .</detailed_description>
