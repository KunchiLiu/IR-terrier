	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose azacitidine oxaliplatin treat patient advanced cancer respond treatment return platinum therapy . Azacitidine design activate ( turn ) certain gene cancer cell whose job fight tumor . Oxaliplatin design block growth spread new cancer cell , eventually destroy , damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . Giving azacitidine oxaliplatin may kill cancer cell may also reverse resistance platinum-based drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Oxaliplatin In Treating Patients With Advanced Cancers Relapsed Refractory Any Platinum Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose 5-azacytidine ( azacitidine ) oxaliplatin combination regimen patient advance solid tumor lymphomas relapsed refractory platinum compound . II . To define 5-azacytidine oxaliplatin pharmacokinetics . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . For patient treated expansion phase study : ( ) ass copper transport protein ( CTR1 ) score ; ( b ) ass change global DNA methylation ; ( c ) measure change oxaliplatin level tumor biopsy pretreatment day 12 first cycle 5-azacytidine plus oxaliplatin therapy . II . To correlate result pharmacokinetic study 5-azacytidine oxaliplatin change CTR1 , change global DNA methylation change oxaliplatin level tissue biopsies patient treated expansion phase study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive azacitidine IV 15-30 minute day 1-5 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 2-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
