	<brief_title>Does Integrative Neuro-psychotherapy Program Foster Adjustment Depressed Stroke Patients ? A Randomized Controlled Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background A brain injury one common cause disability acquire adulthood . The full extent impairment usually become clear course rehabilitation . Apart emotional effect deal impairment , also invariably matter adjust life disability . In phase realization come term condition , many brain-injured people develop mental disorder ( mainly adjustment disorder depressive and/or anxiety symptom ) . Mental disorder related adjustment significant often limit factor patient rehabilitation . While extensive body literature diagnosis treatment cognitive disorder follow brain injury , research diagnosis treatment clinical disorder follow brain injury scarce . There many theoretical observation available literature way deal adjustment disorder follow brain injury order maximize patient 's rehabilitation outcome . Yet current research , base randomized study , still infancy . The main aim current project close scientific gap . A key objective propose study investigate whether integration neuropsychological psychotherapeutic technique additional caregiver support program offer benefit process cop effect brain injury . It expect integrative neuro-psychotherapy effective treatment emotional distress reaction structure solution focus therapy . Moreover , strong improvement acceptance , awareness , quality life goal attainment anticipate patient receive integrative neuro-psychotherapy treatment .

Primary caregiver support online coaching tool . Assessments make baseline , 10 session ( progress ) , 20 session ( termination ) 6 month post treatment ( follow-up ) . The hypothesis statistically significant difference two group test independent t-tests . Moreover , correlation test apply test post-hoc whether extent improvement measure BDI-II depend neuropsychological functional level cognitive area memory executive functioning . A lesion analysis estimation lesion volume carry post-hoc order test whether factor predict effectiveness integrative neuro-psychotherapy .</detailed_description>
