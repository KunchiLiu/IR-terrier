	<brief_summary>We propose perform randomize controlled patient assessor blind trial woman age 18 70 year acute uncomplicated UTI evaluate initial symptomatic treatment 3 day non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac ( experimental intervention ) immediate antibiotic treatment norfloxacin 3 day ( control intervention ) . Both intervention follow optional delay antibiotic treatment single dose fosfomycin deem necessary patient . The primary objective determine whether initial symptomatic treatment follow optional delay antibiotic treatment ( experimental intervention ) non-inferior immediate antibiotic treatment ( control intervention ) term symptom resolution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Symptomatic Therapy Uncomplicated Lower Urinary Tract Infections Ambulatory Setting .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) frequent bacterial infection diagnose treated general practitioner account 15 % antibiotic prescription ambulatory medicine . World-wide raise antibiotic resistance among uropathogens , commonly Escherichia coli , threaten treatment UTI . Uncomplicated UTI , frequent manifestation UTI , benign , self-limited disease primary goal treatment symptom relief cure . Antibiotic treatment reduces duration symptom 1-2 day 5-6 day 3-4 day . Symptoms cystitis result inflammation evoke bacterial product stimulate production prostaglandin cyclooxygenase dependent mechanism . Therefore , propose symptom control non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , inhibitor cyclooxygenase 1 2 , may equally effective symptom control standard antibiotic therapy non-complicated UTI may therefore help reduce antibiotic consumption . Objective The primary objective determine whether initial symptomatic treatment follow optional delay antibiotic treatment ( experimental intervention ) non-inferior immediate antibiotic treatment follow optional delay antibiotic treatment ( control intervention ) term symptom resolution . The secondary objective determine whether experimental intervention superior control reduce proportion patient undergoing antibiotic treatment . Methods Randomized control patient assessor blind trial perform general practice . Study population woman age 18 70 year acute uncomplicated UTI . The experimental intervention consist symptomatic treatment diclofenac 75mg twice daily , follow optional , delayed antibiotic treatment single dose 3g fosfomycin deem necessary patient . The control intervention consist immediate antibiotic treatment norfloxacin 400mg twice daily three day , follow optional , delayed antibiotic treatment single dose 3g fosfomycin deem necessary patient . Patients use diary describe symptom 10 day . A follow-up telephone interview perform day 10 30 .</detailed_description>
