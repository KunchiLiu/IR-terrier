The primary outcome measure overall rate ED utilization study group . Under Aim 3 , economic attractiveness propose approach determine . Under Aim 4 , technology result study disseminated public medium , publication presentation . Information-augmented care transition sit result improve care coordination , high quality care , appropriate care . This trial deploy two cycle order support need care management network full intervention develop . Cycle 1 run December , 2009 December , 2010 . It assess impact notice hospital admission ED encounter derive billing data send daily care manager 47,000 patient enrol NPCCN study outcome . Cycle 2 run December , 2010 December , 2011 address AIM 2 original grant proposal . For Cycle 2 , event detect ADT bill data generate daily .
