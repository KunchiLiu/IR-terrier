	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose LOC-paclitaxel give patient metastatic melanoma . The safety drug control disease also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Weekly LOC-paclitaxel Injection Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . LOC-paclitaxel redesigned version paclitaxel . Fatty acid add paclitaxel , may help paclitaxel stay tumor longer high concentration . This first study use LOC-paclitaxel human . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level LOC-paclitaxel base join study . Up 9 dose level LOC-paclitaxel test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose LOC-paclitaxel found . Once high tolerable dose LOC-paclitaxel found , 12 participant receive study drug dose level . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 6 week . You receive LOC-paclitaxel vein 1 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 cycle . If experience side effect , dose study drug may lower . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test test tumor marker . - If melanoma head neck , CT scan neck . - If skin lesion , photograph take lesion . Your private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless lesion face . You able identify picture may take lesion . Once week : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check blood cell count . - Urine collect routine test . - You ask experienced side effect . Every 6 week , x-rays CT scan check status disease per standard care . If response treatment ( disease disappear tumor get small ) , x-rays CT scan repeat 4 week . After , repeat every 6 week . If experience low blood count study , doctor think severe , bone marrow biopsy check cause low blood counts.To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . If doctor think need , ECGs extra blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn . Any procedure list consent form may perform frequently , doctor think need . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Testing : Extra blood also draw PK test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn follow time : - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood drawn dose LOC-paclitaxel , end dose , 5 time next 11 hour dose . - On Days 2-7 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 1 time day . - On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 1 time day . - On Day 29 Cycle 1 , blood drawn dose , end dose , 5 time next 11 hour dose . - On Days 30-35 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 1 time day . Length Study : You study long benefiting . You take study experience intolerable side effect disease get bad . End-of-Study Visit : After study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test measure tumor marker . - You CT scan check status disease . - If low blood count , bone marrow biopsy check side effect . - If skin lesion , photograph take lesion . After go study , extra test may need safety . This may include routine blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) continue recovered side effect , may 3-4 week . This investigational study . LOC-paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available . LOC-paclitaxel currently use research purpose . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
