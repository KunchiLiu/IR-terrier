	<detailed_description>Background : Acute kidney injury frequent incidence rate 35-50 % hospital . The mortality rate would high 50-60 % renal replacement therapy need . Many study time start discontinuation dialysis , dialysis dose , dialyzer , anticoagulation dialysates initiate result still controversial . In addition , new biomarkers find predict outcome acute kidney injury biomarkers may play important role dilemma aforementioned study Objectives : 1 . To find predictor outcome acute kidney injury renal replacement therapy determine appropriate method renal replacement therapy acute kidney injury 2 . To find relationship new biomarkers acute kidney injury determine whether factor monitor response renal replacement therapy . Methods : 1 . Study duration : 2010/01/01 2011/6/30 2 . Patient eligibility : 18 years-old admit medical intensive care unit National Taiwan University Hospital 3 . A prospective study collect parameter include underlying disease , vital sign , biochemistry data , urine output , disease severity score , dialysis timing , dialysis dose , dialyzer , anticoagulation agent 4 . Collect serum urine sample biomarkers patient agree Statistics : Normally distribute variable express mean Â± SDs . Statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 . All statistical analysis perform SAS statistical software . Comparisons two group assess student 's unpaired test Mann-Whitney test . Differences two group analyze ANOVA ( ANOVA ) use one-way ANOVA . Survival analysis make Kaplan-Meier survival curve Cox proportional hazard model . Keywords : acute kidney injury , renal replacement therapy , biomarkers</detailed_description>
