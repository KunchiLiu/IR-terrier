	<brief_title>Rilotumumab Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) patient persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event associate treatment AMG 102 ( rilotumumab ) assess National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . II . To determine duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore association panel biomarkers ( assayed immunohistochemistry mutation analysis ) measure response treatment AMG 102 ( rilotumumab ) clinical outcome archive tumor tissue . II . To evaluate circulate pre- post-treatment level hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor marker angiogenesis association response treatment AMG 102 ( rilotumumab ) clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive rilotumumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 14 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
