	<brief_summary>MP4OX novel oxygen therapeutic agent specifically develop perfuse oxygenate tissue risk ischemia hypoxia . MP4OX pegylated hemoglobin-based colloid result molecular size unique oxygen dissociation characteristic , target oxygen delivery ischemic tissue selectively off-loading oxygen tissue predispose low oxygen tension . Sangart currently evaluate MP4OX reduce organ dysfunction failure trauma patient lactic acidosis due severe hemorrhagic shock .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIa Study MP4OX Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute traumatic injury , include blunt penetrate injury , often associate severe bleed lead hemorrhagic shock . During shock , inadequate perfusion critical organ lead local ischemia tissue hypoxia ( insufficient oxygenation ) , detected increase serum lactate level . Despite optimal care , 10 % trauma victim reach hospital alive die , many suffer organ failure . Death significant , persistent morbidity consequence trauma , traumatic injury associate lost productivity , reduce quality life , direct cost patient health care system worldwide . Current therapy , also include blood transfusion , aim support fail organ , therapeutic agent could help quickly restore adequate oxygenation may beneficial prevent shorten duration organ failure improve patient outcome . Direct support propose clinical application use MP4OX resuscitation hemorrhage find preclinical animal study . Using pig model uncontrolled hemorrhage resuscitation , survival great restoration hemodynamics acid-base status improve MP4OX relative equivalent volume crystalloid , pentastarch , unmodified hemoglobin . Administration MP4OX improve 24-hour survival , stabilize cardiac output arterial pressure nearly normal level , reduce lactate level effectively control fluid . Importantly , benefit MP4OX observe without co-administration autologous blood , suggest blood alone sufficient achieve complete resuscitation , effect MP4OX appear additional blood .</detailed_description>
