	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood bone marrow patient cancer may help doctor identify biomarkers related cancer . PURPOSE : This research study look blood bone marrow sample patient chronic myelogenous leukemia enrol CALGB clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Blood Bone Marrow Samples Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Enrolled CALGB Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Monitor molecular response rate patient receive treatment chronic myelogenous leukemia quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) quantitative Southern blot monitoring blood sample . - Compare quantitative RT-PCR quantitative Southern blot result marrow cytogenetics time complete molecular response patient . - Monitor frequency residual disease patient achieve complete blood Southern blot marrow cytogenetic response ( eradication BCR/ABL Southern blot absence Philadelphia chromosome cytogenetics ) . OUTLINE : Peripheral blood sample bone marrow aspirate collect baseline 3 , 6 , 9 month start therapy . If patient continue receive protocol treatment 9 month , additional peripheral blood sample collect every 6 month bone marrow aspirate take annually . In event disease progression ( blast crisis ) , additional peripheral blood sample bone marrow aspirate collect . Samples examine quantitative Southern blot analysis probe BCR , quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis BCR/ABL fusion transcript , cytogenetic analysis . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study within 1.5 year .</detailed_description>
