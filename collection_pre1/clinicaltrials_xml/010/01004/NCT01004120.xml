	<brief_summary>The traditional risk factor obesity inappropriate diet , lack exercise genetic factor . However , recent observation involve gut microbiota profile additional influence . In case , exist possibility modulate diet . Research show gut microbiota obese human mouse model obesity alter towards less beneficial one compare lean counterpart . This raise possibility modulate gut microbiota novel strategy tackle epidemic obesity diabetes sweep develop world . In addition , direct effect high-fat induced disruption intestinal microbiota also see murine model . Elevated circulating level lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) major build block antigen Gram-negative bacteria , show generate low grade chronic inflammation , term metabolic endotoxemia , onset insulin resistance . High-fat diet show disrupt Gram-negative intestinal population animal , liberate LPS . The effect prebiotics microbiota metabolic syndrome ( combination disorder increase risk develop cardiovascular disease diabetes ) overweight adult investigate thus far . The investigator therefore propose investigate effect galactooligosaccharide ( GOS ) faecal microbiota metabolic syndrome risk factor overweight adult double-blind , randomise , placebo control , cross-over trial .</brief_summary>
