	<brief_title>Molecular Breast Imaging : A Novel Technology Detection Malignant Breast Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , breast-dedicated gamma camera use assessment breast malignancy 1000 woman Mayo Clinic , Rochester , USA . Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) , utilizes Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride ( CZT ) gamma camera scintimammography , show high sensitivity ( 91 % ) detection breast lesion &gt; 5 mm diameter 69 % tumor small 5mm . In Israel , genetic high- risk breast cancer highly relevant . We offer new image technology , wide patient population/group Israel , refer physician and/or breast-imaging physician look additional imaging modality . Therefore stage include : - Women equivocal finding Mammography , US and/or MRI - Women discrepancy CBE ( clinical breast examination ) breast image - Women dense breast - Women high risk Breast Cancer Before image procedure woman need fill detail questionnaire , specific study , include information medical history , family history , gynecology information , menstrual phase , use hormone etc . The image correlate image test include mammography , US MRI . We follow woman least 6 month , include biopsy finding clinical image exam . This phase include 500 woman .</detailed_description>
