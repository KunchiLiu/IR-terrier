	<brief_title>First-line Dasatinib Plus Conventional Chemotherapy Adults With Newly Diagnosed Ph-Positive ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent clinical trial imatinib combination cytotoxic agent front-line treatment , demonstrate improved complete remission ( CR ) rate well outcome adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( Ph-positive ALL ) . Previously , also demonstrate positive impact first-line imatinib interim therapy outcome allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) adult Ph-positive ALL . Nevertheless , substantial proportion patient continue die result disease progression . Recently , demonstrate reduction BCR-ABL transcript level least 3 log completion imatinib therapy find powerful predictor lower relapse well disease-free survival allogeneic SCT . In light disease aggressiveness recurrence , mainly result outgrowth leukemic subclones imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutation , improve strategy induce effective leukemic cell clearance pretransplantation treatment course clearly need . Dasatinib , potent dual BCR-ABL/SRC family kinase inhibitor , demonstrate 325-fold great activity native BCR-ABL compare imatinib show efficacy imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutation exception T315I . According START-L ( SRC/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Activity : Research Trials Dasatinib ) trial , dasatinib ( 70 mg twice daily ) induce rapid hematologic cytogenetic response substantial proportion patient imatinib-resistant intolerant Ph-positive ALL ( hematologic CR rate , 33 % ; major cytogenetic response rate , 57 % ; cytogenetic CR rate , 54 % ) . However , median duration major cytogenetic response 6.9 month . Considering kinetics resistance , felt likely dasatinib monotherapy sufficient first-line treatment Ph-positive ALL . Allogeneic SCT clearly benefit certain high-risk patient , Ph-positive ALL show poor initial response chemotherapy , long-term survival rate SCT markedly increase patient CR . Recent study suggest among adult ALL , transplantation match unrelated donor could yield result similar achieve matched related donor transplantation . While unrelated donor transplant generally associate transplant-related complication match sibling transplant , compensatory decrease relapse rate due strong graft-versus-leukemia effect narrow gap two approach . In addition , reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic SCT increasingly use patient consider poor candidate myeloablative condition SCT advance age concurrent medical condition . Two recent report patient undergo transplant use related unrelated donor reduced-intensity condition regimen ( fludarabine plus melphalan ) show optimistic outcome group patient ALL either high risk first CR transplant achieve subsequent CR . Recently , also demonstrate evidence positive role reduced-intensity condition SCT management high-risk adult ALL ineligible myeloablative transplantation low leukemic cell burden ( especially first CR ) prospective analysis ( phase 2 study ) . From point view , role first-line dasatinib plus conventional chemotherapy follow allogeneic SCT clarify era target drug . Recently , result phase 3 study patient chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia suggest dasatinib ( 100 mg q.d . ) offer favorable overall benefit-risk assessment . On basis result , dasatinib administer orally 100 mg day study . Induction regimen : `` Modified Hyper-CVAD '' - Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 , IV 2 hour , every 12 hour x 6 dos , day 1-3 - Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2/day ( maximum 2 mg/day ) , IV 30 minute , day 4 &amp; 11 - Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day , IV 1 hour , day 4 &amp; 11 - Dexamethasone 40 mg/day , IV push , day 1~4 &amp; day 11-14 First consolidation regimen : `` Cytarabine Mitoxantrone '' - Cytarabine 2 g/m2 , IV 3 hour , every 12 hour x 10 dos , day 1-5 - Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2/day , IV 30 minute , day 1-2 Second consolidation regimen : `` Modified Hyper-CVAD '' - Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 , IV 2 hour , every 12 hour x 6 dos , day 1-3 - Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2/day ( maximum 2 mg/day ) , IV 30 minute , day 4 &amp; 11 - Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day , IV 1 hour , day 4 &amp; 11 - Dexamethasone 40 mg/day , IV push , day 1-4 &amp; day 11-14 Dose chemotherapeutic drug ( except vincristine , dexamethasone , etoposide ) reduce 25 % patient age 50 59 year ; 50 % patient 60 year old . During consolidation phase , serious toxicity ( equal grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity ) require subsequent dose reduction 25 % 50 % attend physician 's discretion . Central nervous system prophylaxis perform intrathecally administer triple agent ( methotrexate 12 mg , cytarabine 40 mg , hydrocortisone 50 mg ; 6 time total ) . After completion induction consolidation chemotherapy recovery leukocyte platelet count , dasatinib give alternative manner ( 100 mg daily mouth 4 week ) . Dasatinib dose adjustment perform accord guideline manage hematologic nonhematologic adverse event dasatinib treatment . Briefly , 1 . Dose escalation permit patient hematologic CR ( 140 mg daily ; 140 mg q.d . 70 mg b.i.d. ) . 2 . Dose reduction ( 80 mg daily ; 80 mg q.d . 40 mg b.i.d . ) interruption permit dasatinib-related grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity grade 2-4 nonhematologic toxicity . Dasatinib administer disease progression intolerable toxicity , determine treat physician . Patients HLA-matched suitable donor undergo allogeneic SCT . Patients without donor undergo continuous consolidation ( 4 course ) maintenance therapy ( dasatinib 100 mg daily 2 year long patient remain hematologic CR stable MRD level ) . The number dasatinib plus conventional chemotherapy dependent speed coordination process ( transplant ) patient 's tolerability ( non-transplants ) . SCT HLA-matched sibling suitably match ( less equal 2-allele mismatch ) family unrelated donor perform accord policy participate institution . A preparative regimen start 7 day last day dasatinib treatment . No prophylactic dasatinib maintenance therapy plan SCT .</detailed_description>
