	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine feasibility short term administration target therapy ( i.e. , anastrozole ) woman newly diagnose early invasive non invasive breast cancer interval breast biopsy surgery . Anastrozole form hormonal therapy part standard treatment hormone sensitive breast cancer postmenopausal woman . This clinical model use evaluate biologic effect drug specific molecular pathway call PI3K/AKT signal pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Pre-Surgical Intervention Studies Evaluating Targeted Therapies Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several clinical model explore use phase I/II evaluation target therapy breast cancer . Biological marker measure early stage invasive cancer presurgical model involve short term intervention . In model , woman newly diagnose early invasive breast cancer receive study drug interval diagnostic breast biopsy surgical resection . Tumor tissue obtain biopsy surgical specimen use measure pre post treatment molecular marker , respectively . The main advantage model include ability obtain direct information molecular response tumor tissue elucidate drug mechanism action , large patient population draw early stage breast cancer , lack unnecessary invasive procedure . We plan conduct pilot study 10 postmenopausal woman newly diagnose estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive invasive non invasive breast cancer receive oral anastrozole 1mg daily two week interval diagnostic breast biopsy definitive breast surgery . Patients identify breast surgeon mammographer perform breast biopsy . Patients histologically confirm ER+ invasive non invasive breast cancer recruit medical oncologist start anastrozole two week prior schedule surgery . The primary objective study demonstrate feasibility presurgical model evaluate target therapy breast cancer . Secondary endpoint include change tissue level proliferation marker Ki67 proteins involve PI3K/AKT signal .</detailed_description>
