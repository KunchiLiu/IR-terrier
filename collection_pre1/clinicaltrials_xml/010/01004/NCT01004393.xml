	<brief_title>Methylnaltrexone Opioid-induced Constipation Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain one common important symptom cancer , often require opioid analgesic control . However constipation one frequent debilitate side effect opioids , occur 40 % -70 % patient treat chronic pain . Although laxative commonly use manage opioid-induced constipation , agent always effective satisfactory . Methylnaltrexone bromide peripherally act antagonist mu-opioid receptor . As quaternary amine , ability methylnaltrexone cross blood-brain barrier limit . This allow methylnaltrexone function peripherally-acting antagonist gastrointestinal tract without impact opioid-mediated analgesic effect central nervous system . The efficacy safety methylnaltrexone treat opioid-induced constipation patient advance disease receive palliative care demonstrate . However efficacy agent evaluate active patient earlier disease course . The present study evaluate efficacy safety methylnaltrexone relief severe opioid-induced constipation population attempt identify factor predictive methylnaltrexone response .</detailed_description>
