	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Kaname Coronary Stent System Treatment Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment coronary artery disease include conservative treatment ( drug therapy ) invasive technique help increase blood flow ischemic oxygen-deprived region heart . Among invasive technique frequently use coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) without stent ( bare metal stent ( BMS ) drug elute stent ( DES ) ) implantation . However , treatment limitation effectiveness diminish certain circumstance . Therefore , essential tailor therapy individual patient consider overall patient 's condition , disease severity progression well concomitant disease . The question selection appropriate stent individual patient still unresolved physician either follow international national guideline scientific wisdom . Although efficacy DES undisputable restenosis prevention , patient could adverse outcomes DES , use selectively likely benefit , decision process several important issue address : Patients ' adherence post-stenting therapy , Bleeding risk , Need elective surgery , Risk restenosis , Risk stent thrombosis . It still believe many patient well BMSs technology require refinement improve outcome . For reason Terumo design new coronary BMS , Kaname™ , balloon expandable Cobalt-Chromium ( CoCr ) stent pre-mounted onto high pressure , semi-compliant balloon rapid exchange delivery catheter . The Kaname stent subject current prospective , multi-centre KARE study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient ≥ 18 year old . Patient eligible PCI acceptable candidate CABG . Clinical evidence ischemic heart disease and/or positive functional study . Documented stable angina pectoris ( CCS 1 , 2 , 3 4 ) unstable angina pectoris document ischemia ( Braunwald Class IBC , IIBC , IIIBC ) , document silent ischemia . The target lesion target vessel meet follow criterion ; ) single de novo lesion restenotic postPTCA ( nonstented ) lesion one native coronary artery.b ) The stenosis target lesion ≥ 50 % &lt; 100 % c ) The target lesion length must ≤ 25 mm ) The target reference vessel diameter must suitable treatment stent 2.5 4.0 mm long Patient inform nature study , understand study requirement agree provision provide write informed consent approve Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee respective clinical site . The patient able comply specify followup evaluation . Most recent LVEF patient &lt; 25 % . Known allergy follow : aspirin , Clopidogrel bisulfate , Prasugrel Ticlopidine , heparin , cobalt , chromium , nickel , contrast agent ( adequately premedicated ) . A platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 . WBC count &lt; 3500 cells/mm3 . Evidence MI positive Troponin within 72 hour intend treatment . Previous PCI ( &lt; 30 day ) anywhere within target vessel . Planned interventional treatment nontarget vessel &lt; 30 day postprocedure require . Planned intervention target vessel significant lesion &gt; 50 % stenosis anywhere within target vessel index procedure require . The target lesion require treatment device PTCA balloon prior stent placement . ( e.g . limited directional coronary atherectomy , excimer laser , rotational atherectomy , etc. ) . Previous stenting anywhere within target vessel . Target vessel evidence thrombus . Excessive tortuousity ( &gt; 60° ) target vessel proximal target lesion ( visual estimate ) . Either follow characteristic target lesion ( visual estimate ) : ) Ostial target lesion bifurcation lesion b ) Target lesion involve side branch &gt; 2mm diameter c ) Target lesion excessive tortuousity ( &gt; 45° ) ) Moderate severely calcify lesion successfully predilated e ) Target lesion locate supplied arterial venous bypass graft f ) Significant ( &gt; 40 % ) stenosis proximal distal target lesion . g ) A complete occlusion ( TIMI flow 0 1 ) . Target lesion locate leave main trunk . Stroke transient ischemic attack &lt; prior 180 day . Active peptic ulcer upper GI bleeding &lt; prior 180 day . The patient bleed hemorrhagic diathesis coagulopathy . The patient refuse blood transfusion . The patient widespread peripheral vascular disease . Acute chronic renal dysfunction ( creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl ) . The patient require multiple stent implantation tandem lesion . Life expectancy &lt; 1 year . Patient currently participate investigational drug device study complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current study endpoint . Note : Trials require extend followup product investigational , become commercially available since , consider investigational trial . In investigator opinion patient comorbid condition ( ) could limit patient 's ability participate study , compliance followup requirement impact scientific integrity study .
