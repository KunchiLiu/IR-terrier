	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether addition bisphosphonate Zometa ( zoledronic acid ) use along standard regimen chemotherapy , help control need palliative intervention malignant pleural effusion due non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zometa Adjuvant Treatment Malignant Pleural Effusion Due To Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural effusion common late stage non-small cell lung cancer lead significantly increase morbidity patient population . The majority patient symptomatic due malignant effusion . The recurrence rate think quite high overall may approach 100 % without treatment.Currently available non-invasive , medical mean control effusion systemic chemotherapy.Zoledronic acid show mouse model malignant pleural effusion decrease fluid accumulation tumor dissemination prolong survival .</detailed_description>
