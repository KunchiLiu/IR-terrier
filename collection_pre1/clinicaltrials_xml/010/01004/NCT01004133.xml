	<brief_summary>With completion human genome project , investigator explore new question human biology . Previously human genetics focus highly penetrant , Mendelian trait ; however , rare common variant discover affect `` common '' diseases multi-gene architecture variable penetrance breast cancer , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease . This change take place investigator tool illuminate whole genome discover genetic variant responsible different disease phenotypes statistical difference population . Besides disease phenotype , health consider human phenotype study . Health merely absence disease may view dynamic ongoing interplay environment genome maintain homeostasis . Individuals often attempt optimize environmental condition accord one genome maximize health . All individual possess potentially beneficial harmful variant depend environment . How dynamic interplay occur genome environment require understanding boundary condition genetic architecture health disease model system simulate observe data . The age process also affect health . Aging involves loss normal cop response internal external environmental stressor signal . Investigators tool uncover bottom mechanism involve maintain ability overcome environmental condition affect health . Against genomic breakthrough whole genome association study , demographic United States quickly change . The old population ( age &gt; 65 year ) 2030 project twice large 2000 represent nearly 20 percent total US population . The first baby boomer turn 65 2011 challenge facets health care come decade . The demographic change underscore need understand mechanism promote health disease cohort . Genomic discovery help individual may reduce medical cost benefit society . In summary , objective study obtain blood and/or saliva sample order help model health disease phenotypes population genomics . The blood and/or saliva sample may allow participant ' entire genome sequence comprehensive analysis become feasible economical .</brief_summary>

Subject significant medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , may interfere patient 's optimal participation study would potentially confound interpretation individual 's phenotype .</criteria>
