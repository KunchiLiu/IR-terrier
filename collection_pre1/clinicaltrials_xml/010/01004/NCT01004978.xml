	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study chemoembolization sorafenib tosylate see well work compare chemoembolization alone treat patient liver cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , mitomycin , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Chemoembolization kill tumor cell carry drug directly blood vessel near tumor block blood flow allow high concentration drug reach tumor long period time . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give chemoembolization together sorafenib tosylate effective chemoembolization alone treat patient liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoembolization With Without Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) chemoembolization alone sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) combination chemoembolization . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) chemoembolization alone sorafenib combination chemoembolization . II . To evaluate extra-hepatic versus intra-hepatic pattern failure . III . To determine rate toxicity relate sorafenib combination chemoembolization . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze pharmacogenetic pharmacokinetic property sorafenib include angiogenesis , monooxygenases , polymorphism multidrug resistance ( MDR ) . II . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) -American College Radiology Imaging Network ( ACRIN ) secondary image objective : site vs. central evaluation PFS . III . To determine inter-reader concordance response characterization four eight month European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) criterion . IV . To determine value objective tumor response four eight month EASL criterion predict PFS ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] ) OS . V. To evaluate effect intra-hepatic vs. extra-hepatic progression OS . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning within 2 week stable dose sorafenib tosylate reach , patient undergo transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride , mitomycin C , cisplatin ( close accrual 10/1/2010 ) ; conventional chemoembolization comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride ; chemoembolization comprise doxorubicin-eluting bead . Treatment TACE repeat approximately every 4 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning within 2 week stable dose placebo reach , patient undergo TACE Arm I . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : After completion chemoembolization , patient receive sorafenib tosylate placebo Arm I II absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 year .</detailed_description>
