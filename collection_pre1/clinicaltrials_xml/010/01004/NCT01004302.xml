	<detailed_description>Various study demonstrate good treatment response Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) often obtain 60 80 % patient , whether employ serotonin reuptake inhibitor behavior therapy . However , subgroup OCD patient refractory classical therapeutic option , even maximum dosage regimen sufficiently long treatment follow-up devise . Severe psychosocial occupational impairment meanwhile observable . These subject often refer stereotactic neurosurgery . Among various surgical technique , radiosurgical modality ( double-shot ventral capsular/ventral striatal - VC/VS gamma capsulotomy , simply double-shot gamma ventral capsulotomy ) recently develop . On hand , randomize control trial Gamma Knife radiosurgeries Psychiatry . The aim study investigate whether double-shot VC/VS gamma capsulotomy efficacious describe adverse events/complications profile , double-blind , randomize control trial radiosurgical technique treatment refractory OCD . Forty-eight refractory OCD patient randomize two different group : first one receive standard radiosurgery ; second group submit false radiosurgical intervention ( `` sham operation '' ) . All subject previously assess preliminary clinical/psychiatric interview , well extensive specific instrument regard psychiatric diagnosis , OCD evolution severity , anxiety/depression symptom , tic expression , psychosocial impairment , personality change , etc . A neuropsychological test battery also employ . All patient offer periodical follow-up , assessment scale neuroimaging exam ( magnetic resonance imaging ) repeat . Patients previously submit placebo surgery able undergo real operation one-year follow-up period , blind break . Scores result analyze among group , well adverse event profile , cognitive/personality change , clinical global functioning neuroimaging finding . Improvements Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) score take primary treatment response criterion .</detailed_description>
