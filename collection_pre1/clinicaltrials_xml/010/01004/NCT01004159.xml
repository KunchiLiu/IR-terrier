	<brief_title>Cetuximab Plus Irinotecan Colorectal Cancer Patients Who Progressed After Failure With Cetuximab Plus Irinotecan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab manufacture antibody-antibodies protein find circulate blood stream . The growth colorectal cancer may affect interaction growth factor know `` epidermal growth factor '' ( EGF ) receptor . Cetuximab antibody direct receptor EGF show turn activity receptor stop growth cancer cell many laboratory test . Cetuximab recently approve Food Drug Administration treatment patient advance colorectal cancer fail standard chemotherapy . Cetuximab show delay progression colorectal cancer give alone patient fail standard chemotherapy give chemotherapy drug call irinotecan patient fail irinotecan .</detailed_description>

Presence measurable disease define lesion ≥ 2 cm CT ( 1 cm spiral CT ) . All sit disease evaluate ≤ 3 week treatment initiation Patients fail deem intolerant standard chemotherapy treatment oxaliplatin fluoropyrimidines Patients may receive investigational agent include study . Prior investigational anticancer agent wil allow within 4 week prior study treatment . Herbal medicine vitamin wil consider contraindication enrollment study . Patients know brain metastasis eligible unless brain metastasis treat stable radiographic followup without significant symptomatology History invasive cancer current evidence disease Patients chemotherapy target therapy least 3 week study treatment . Mitomycin C treatment least 6 week study treatment History allergic reaction irinotecan Prior severe infusion reaction cetuximab History allergic reaction tetracycline doxycycline Need prior dose reduction cetuximab secondary grade 3 skin toxicity Active skin toxicity grade 2 high time study enrollment Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
