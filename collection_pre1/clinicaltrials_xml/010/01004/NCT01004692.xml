	<brief_summary>Rationale : The effect vertical dimension sleep apnoea respiratory variable obstructive sleep apnoea patient . Objective : To extend possible worsen OSA condition , cause increase mouth open take consideration daily dental practice , occlusal stabilization splint ( OSS ) place mouth . Study design : Cross RCT-design Study population : OSA patient refer ACTA Slotervaart Hospital , treatment Mandibular Advancement Device ( MAD ) , least 18 year old . Intervention : Occlusal stabilization splint ( OSS ) upper jaw control condition cross-over design Main study parameters/endpoints : Apnoea- Hypopnoea Index ( AHI ) Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) . The aim study determine effect vertical dimension OS sleep respiratory variable OSA patient . The hypothesis insertion OSS increase vertical dimension result significant increase AHI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Occlusal Splints Respiratory Variables Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild Moderate OSA patient ( AHI 10-30 ) refer Slotervaart Hospital , ACTA , treatment MAD . Both male female participate study . All participant 18 year old . Inclusion criterion - All patient invite least 18 year old . - OSA patient , diagnosis base baseline polysomnographic recording ( hospital ) AHI value 30 ( mild+ moderate OSAS ) . - Adequate retention dentition occlusal stabilization splint ( OSS ) . Exclusion criterion - Medicine usage influence sleep ( eg Benzodiazepines ) . - BMI 40 - Unhealthy dentition . - Severe bruxers - TMD patient An occlusal stabilization splint ( OSS ) construct patient , intervention device . The splint hard acrylic-resin stabilization appliance wear upper jaw . The OSS come contact gum patient act orthodontic device . The OSS use three night row , ambulatory-PSG recording OSS situ . After write informed consent obtain , patient randomly allocate one two group . To ensure group would approx . size , block randomization use . Block size use size vary randomly . The allocation sequence automatically generate subsequently conceal independent co-worker , keep paper copy lockable drawer . All patient refer ACTA , Center sleep wake disorder Slotervaart Hospital . There do PSG-sleep study . The PSG record take place dark hospital room , Slotervaart Hospital Amsterdam , department Clinical Neurophysiology ( The multidisciplinary Centre Sleep-Wake Disorders ) . OSA patient diagnosis mild moderate OSA invite participate trial . Following PSG record diagnosis Slotervaart Hospital , patient come first appointment , department Oral Function , section Oral Kinesiology , ACTA . Medical dental history obtain . If patient fulfill inclusion criterion agree participate study , impression upper low jaw , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , neck circumference , Epworth Sleepiness Scale obtain . The medical history obtain use questionnaire , dental history use questionnaire , clinical dental examination , OPG x-ray ( orthopantomogram ) . The BMI obtain measure height weight patient . ( BMI = kg/ cm Â² ) . The neck circumference measure cm . Impressions alginate wax-index dental wax take every patient , order make dental cast construction splint . The whole procedure last approximately 1 hour . The patient randomly divide two group . The patient randomly place two group . The patient undergo PSG-recordings without OSS situ night OSS situ , cross-over design . Group 1 : The patient undergo 3 night home-PSG record without OSS situ first . 2 week later undergo 3 night PSG-recording OSS situ . Group 2 : The patient Group 2 first undergo 3 night ambulatory PSG-recording OSS situ . 2 week later undergo 3 night home-PSG record without OSS situ . Appointments make either OSS placement ACTA mount equipment ambulatory recording , Slotervaart hospital , depend group patient randomly place . Group 1 : The mount equipment ambulatory record take place department Clinical Neurophysiology Slotervaart Hospital . The procedure last approximately 1 hour . The Monet hardware ( Medcare , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) 19 record channel use recording Rembrandt software use analysis . The patient sleep home ambulatory PSG equipment 3 night row , without OSS situ . That mean 3 mount appointment hold department Clinical Neurophysiology Slotervaart Hospital , 3 afternoon row . Every morning home PSG-recording , patient take electrode home ( use solution provide , order resolve glue ) bring equipment back ACTA . In meantime ( first second visit ACTA ) , OSS upper jaw construct every patient . The OSS construct dental laboratory patient . It make hard acrylic resin palatal coverage make . The patient come back ACTA 1 week ( second appointment ) placement splint ( OSS ) . On second appointment ACTA OSS place . The patient wear OSS , order get use , period one week undergo 3 night ambulatory sleep recording OSS situ . Group 2 : The patient come back ACTA 1 week ( second appointment ACTA ) placement splint ( OSS ) . The patient wear OSS , order get use , period one week undergo 3 night ambulatory sleep recording OSS situ . The mount equipment ambulatory record take place department Clinical Neurophysiology Slotervaart Hospital . The procedure last approximately 1 hour . The Monet hardware ( Medcare , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) 19 record channel use recording Rembrandt software use analysis . The patient sleep home ambulatory PSG equipment 3 day row , OSS situ . That mean 3 mount appointment hold department Clinical Neurophysiology Slotervaart Hospital , 3 afternoon row . Every morning home PSG-recording , patient take electrode home ( use solution provide , order resolve glue ) bring equipment back ACTA . Two week later , patient belong 2nd group , undergo 3 ambulatory recording home , without OSS situ . All patient fill 10 questionnaire begin study end study . The ESS `` morning- questionnaire '' evening- questionnaire '' fill patient night well . That mean beginning , end study 6 day home- PSG recording . Following last home PSG recording mention data collect ( patient , belong group ) : - Body Mass Index ( BMI ) - Neck circumference - The Epworth Sleepiness Scale - Side effect splint ( OSS ) . The main study parameter/ endpoint Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index ( AHI ) value . The secondary study parameter Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) . The side effect splint ( OSS ) evaluate .</detailed_description>
