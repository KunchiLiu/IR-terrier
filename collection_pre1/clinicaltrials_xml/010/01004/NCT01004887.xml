	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research study look tissue blood sample patient high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tissue Blood Samples From Patients With High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate diagnostic prognostic relevance various molecular , cytogenetic , tumor marker high-grade glioma paraffin-embedded tissue collect patient enrol Mayo Clinic North Central Cancer Treatment Group ( NCCTG ) high-grade glioma trial conduct since 1979 . - To evaluate alteration specific chromosome chromosomal region include 7 , 9p , 10p , 10q , 13q , 17p , 17q , 19q , 22q , X , Y use PCR analysis microsatellite repeat FISH . - To determine DNA ploidy flow cytometric analysis . - To examine various marker cellular proliferation cellular function include flow cytometric determination % S-phase , % G2M , immunohistochemical evaluation PCNA , Ki-67 , p53 . - To evaluate additional marker identify Glioma Markers Network . - To compare incidence marker major histologic subtypes ( anaplastic astrocytoma [ AA ] , anaplastic oligoastrocytoma [ AOA ] , glioblastoma multiforme [ GBM ] ) ass correlation total group , well within subtypes . - To compare ploidy determination FISH flow cytometry . OUTLINE : Paraffin-embedded tissue peripheral blood sample , previously currently collect clinical trial participant time she/he enrol trial , evaluate many marker possible , change cytogenic molecular genetic tumor marker , frequency distribution tumor marker histological clinical variable polymerase chain reaction , IHC , flow cytometry , FISH analysis .</detailed_description>
