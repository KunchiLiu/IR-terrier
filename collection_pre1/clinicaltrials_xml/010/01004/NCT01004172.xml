	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine well combination bevacizumab carboplatin work treat breast cancer spread brain . Bevacizumab antibody ( protein attack foreign substance body ) make laboratory . Bevacizumab work differently way chemotherapy drug work . Usually chemotherapy drug attack fast grow cancer cell body . Bevacizumab work slow stop growth cell cancer tumor decrease blood supply tumor . When blood supply decrease , tumor n't get oxygen nutrient need grow . Carboplatin class drug know platinum-containing compound approve use treatment ovarian cancer . Information research study suggest combination bevacizumab carboplatin may effective treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants receive bevacizumab carboplatin intravenously . In addition bevacizumab carboplatin , participant whose cancer positive HER2 receive Herceptin intravenously . Herceptin standard treatment patient HER2-positive breast cancer . - The first treatment cycle last four week . Participants receive bevacizumab Day 1 carboplatin Day 8 . After first treatment cycle , treatment cycle thereafter last three week participant receive bevacizumab carboplatin together Day 1 cycle . - Physical exam vital sign perform collected multiple time point participant first treatment cycle begin cycle thereafter . - Participants brain MRI MRA day 2-4 first treatment cycle end second treatment cycle research purpose . These scan mandatory must perform Massachusetts General Hospital-Charlestown Navy Yard facility . A brain MRI perform every cycle ( end cycle 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , etc. ) . Participants also CT MRI scan body enof every treatment cycle . - MUGA ECHO scan do every 4 treatment cycle . - Participants blood test do Day 8 first treatment cycle begin every treatment cycle thereafter check blood cell count well organ function . - A urine test do every cycle ( begin cycle 3 , 5 , 7 , etc . )</detailed_description>
