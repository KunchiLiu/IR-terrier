	<brief_title>A Study Pemetrexed Bevacizumab Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study 3 period : baseline period ; study treatment period , include induction maintenance treatment ; follow-up period . Approximately 110 participant enrol study , aim 100 evaluable participant . Eligible participant first receive 4 cycle induction chemotherapy pemetrexed-cisplatin-bevacizumab . Participants achieve response progress completion induction chemotherapy adequate performance status receive maintenance therapy pemetrexed-bevacizumab . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurs . When treatment discontinue , participant health status monitor till death , loss follow-up data cut-off date . Participants continue receive benefit treatment time data cut-off may receive continued access pemetrexed bevacizumab disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , reason investigator participant decision .</detailed_description>
