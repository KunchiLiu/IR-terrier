	<brief_summary>Glaucoma affect 66 million people worldwide lead cause irreversible blindness , Primary angle-closure glaucoma ( PACG ) major form glaucoma Asia . Laser peripheral iridotomy ( LPI ) advocate first line treatment case PACG . In addition relieve relative pupil block element condition , open drainage angle , alleviate appositional synechial angle-closure long-term may control intraocular pressure ( IOP ) prevent progression glaucomatous optic neuropathy . However recent data indicate iridotomy successful control IOP long term , majority case develop clinically significant rise IOP require medical therapy surgery . Laser trabeculoplasty recognize treatment option Primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) since 1980s . Recently selective less destructive method perform laser trabeculoplasty evolve . Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) specifically target pigment trabecular meshwork cell without produce collateral damage destruction adjacent structure . Morphologic study perform human autopsy eye treat SLT note structural collateral thermal damage trabecular beam uveal corneoscleral meshwork . As SLT specifically effect target pigmented trabecular meshwork unlikely generate PAS . It may useful treatment option PACG patient angle widen follow laser peripheral iridotomy . The propose study randomize control trial ass effectiveness SLT reduce IOP case PACG angle open follow LPI , IOP remain high ( &gt; 21 mmHg ) . 100 subject randomize receive either SLT medical treatment achieve IOP control . They follow 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) Lowering Effect Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty Versus Prostaglandin Analogues Angle Closure Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The aim study determine whether selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) effective treatment lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) patient primary angle closure glaucoma ( PACG ) , compare prostaglandin analogue , current first choice IOP-lowering medical therapy . STUDY DESIGN The study design project prospective randomize controlled trial . It possible blind either subject observer intervention due use laser intervention group medical therapy control group . Subjects followed-up 6 month STUDY POPULATION The study population patient primary angle closure glaucoma attend Singapore National Eye Centre , fulfil inclusion criterion willing take part study . WASH OUT REGIMEN : patient already medication Eligible patient already one two-glaucoma medication require complete washout period randomize . Washout period vary accord previous medication use follow : Prostaglandin analogues 4 week Beta blocker 3 week Adrenergic agonist 2 week Cholinergic agonist 5 day Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors 5 day Pre-study washout period check Patients prostaglandin analogue beta blocker prior study require undergo washout period 3 4 week respectively prior study . For group patient , safety check second week . Patients whose IOP &gt; 30 mm hg washout check stop washout withdrawn study . Treatment subject PLANNED INTERVENTION Selective laser trabeculoplasty procedure The laser procedure perform patient follow - A drop Brimonidine instill eye treat 15 minute prior procedure . - Topical anaesthesia administer Latina SLT lens couple fluid use procedure . - The slit-lamp attach laser focus full height trabecular meshwork . - The laser power set 0.6mJ increase 0.1mJ step small champagne -like bubble appear treat area trabecular meshwork . The laser spot size would 400µm . - Approximately 60-120 non-overlapping shot place onto least 180 degree trabecular meshwork visible without PAS . More non-overlapping shot place sufficient extent trabeculum visible . Post - laser patient give one week course topical Prednisolone forte four time day treat eye . Intraocular pressure check 30-60 minute procedure . IOP spike ≥ 5mmHg level ≥ 28mmHg treated Diamox contraindicate . Intraocular pressure check one week post SLT . If IOP ≥28mmHg , tablet diamox give 3 day . Retreatment SLT If IOP remain elevate , one treatment SLT give patient . This treatment administer either four week three month follow visit . If &lt; 20 % reduction IOP baseline either week 4 month 3 follow-up visit , SLT repeat use laser parameter describe . The patient see one week repeat laser treatment . IIf IOP &lt; 21mmHg &gt; 20 % reduction IOP baseline week 4 month 3 follow-up visit , treatment give patient . IOP check one week repeat SLT . If IOP still high ( &gt; 24 mmHg ) , treatment modification provide ( see Treatment Modification ) . Control group Those patient randomize control group commence topical treatment low IOP . The agent lower IOP prostaglandin analogue , Travoprost , apply day night . A stepwise addition Timolol 0.5 % , dorzolamide brimonidine implement IOP control ( see Treatment Modification ) .</detailed_description>
