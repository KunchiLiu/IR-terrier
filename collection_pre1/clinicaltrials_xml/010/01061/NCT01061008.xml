	<brief_title>Handgrip Exercise Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The arteriovenous fistula consider gold standard form access haemodialysis patient , however 37 % haemodialysis patient form access . A possible explanation could high fistula failure rate due lack maturation . Therefore intervention aim enhance fistula maturation warrant . One intervention could forearm exercise , however recommendation evidence base . Therefore , purpose study investigate whether program post operative progressive hand grip exercise improve fistula maturation .</detailed_description>
