	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness deep brain stimulation treat people severe otherwise treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder . We also expect determine DBS affect brain activity brain circuit strongly implicate OCD , effect may relate symptom change . This treatment study therefore also permit unique crucial test current neuroanatomical model OCD pathogenesis mechanism underlie response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation Internal Capsule Intractable Obsessive-compulsive Disorder ( OCD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) chronic debilitate illness affect 2 % 3 % adult population United States . People OCD often experience persistent unwanted thought carry ritual-like behavior rid obsessive thought . Additionally , OCD symptoms usually tie feeling intense anxiety functional impairment , make important people OCD seek effective treatment . Although currently many treatment option OCD , include psychotherapy medication serotonin reuptake inhibitor , 40 % 60 % people OCD partially respond , respond , treatment method . Given large percentage people respond aggressive conventional treatment , alternative option necessary people treatment-resistant OCD . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) procedure involve se thin wire carry electric current part brain associate produce OCD symptom . DBS effectively safely used treat movement disorder , Parkinson 's disease , may beneficial reduce OCD symptom severity . This study evaluate safety efficacy DBS treat people severe treatment-resistant OCD . Study participation follow-up last 2 year . Participants allow remain pre-surgical medication behavioral therapy program throughout study . Before surgery , participant undergo series initial test examination include psychiatric , medical , neuropsychological history examination . Implantation device perform single session . The lead insert anterior limb internal capsule , implant local anesthesia . On day surgery , participant metal frame fix head support surgery , magnetic resonance imagining ( MRI ) use determine exact placement wire . An extension wire pas scalp area subclavicular region connect electrode subcutaneous implanted pulse generator ( IPG ) , implant general anesthesia . After placement DBS system , patient admit hospital overnight observation possible complication . Postoperative evaluation consist physical neurological examination , postoperative CBC , electrolyte panel , x-rays head , neck , chest , standard shunt series ensure integrity connection , head CT scan monitor possible postoperative intracranial hemorrhage . Surgical implantation follow three-week period stimulation , intensive five-day preliminary outpatient stimulation trial , follow longer-term outpatient stimulation . All patient follow sequence test condition . The initial DBS test open , follow three block test patient investigator administer rating scale inform stimulation condition . These three block general three month long , may longer short depend stability clinical improvement , possible emergence symptom worsen . The remainder study , two-year study endpoint , consist continuation phase active open stimulation .</detailed_description>
