	<brief_summary>In research study , look perform repeat biopsy patient ' tumor , even though already diagnose cancer . The tumor tissue obtain biopsy study see look like molecular ( genetic ) level . By conduct study , hope learn cancer work , cancer respond certain treatment , become resistant certain treatment . We also hope demonstrate biopsy like perform safely large number patient . The research do tumor sample may help u identify patient future likely respond new cancer therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- In order participate research study , participant must already diagnosed cancer . The cancer must locate part body accessible biopsy doctor perform biopsy must agree participant good candidate biopsy . The biopsy do usual way , part standard medical care . - After biopsy , participant return clinic approximately one week later check status . At visit participant ask question post-biopsy health . We continue follow-up participant phone subsequent clinic visit one month follow biopsy . - The biopsy obtain studied Translational Research Laboratory Massachusetts General Hospital , undergo panel genetic test . These test look find driving cancer make tick . It important understand genetic test include number cancer relate gene protein may important make treatment decision , either future . The test result may may show finding could affect participant 's treatment option . There specific test do inherited genetic abnormality , undergo research give information risk cancer people participant 's family . - If left-over tissue biopsy , also use try discover new finding cancer respond become resistant cancer treatment . These experiment include try grow cancer cell petri dish lab try grow cancer cell inside research mouse learn cancer work . This portion test os part research study consider experimental , result enter participant ' medical record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must already know metastatic , incurable cancer . 2 . Patients must refer repeat tumor biopsy part standard care biopsy must approve appropriate biopsy service ( interventional radiology surgery ) . Such approval include review medical history laboratory parameter per standard care . 3 . 18 year age old 4 . Patients must previously respond molecularlytargeted therapy subsequently develop resistance , analogous clinical situation determine molecular genotype interest clinically and/or scientifically . No specific exclusion criterion .</criteria>
