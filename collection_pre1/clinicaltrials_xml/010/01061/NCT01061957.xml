	<brief_title>Raltegravir Treatment Patients Failing Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) Denmark</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) introduce decade ago therapy decrease mortality morbidity HIV patient dramatically . The first HAART regimen combine nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . Especially early regime carry substantial risk failure subsequent development resistance three drug class . Thus need development new drug activity viruses resistant classical HAART regimens either new drug old class without ( limited ) cross resistance old compound drug new class new antiretroviral mechanism . The optimal choice salvage therapy HIV infect patient show require least two , preferably three , fully active drug . Until recently , salvage regimen use treat patient harbour multidrug-resistant HIV generally include one new agent classic drug class add optimize background therapy contain fully active agent . This approach , condition limited drug option , put patient high risk virological failure resistance new agent , well agent drug class . A breakthrough resent development integrase inhibitor , new class antiretroviral drug . One drug - raltegravir - demonstrated activity patient virological failure classical antiretroviral drug . In BENCHMARK randomize clinical trial , conduct HIV-infected patient limited treatment option , 62 % patient take raltegravir plus optimized background treatment achieve plasma HIV RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL week 48 . Although drug - often use together new drug - prove effective clinical trial recently `` real life '' clinical setting , long-term efficacy describe effect compare treatment HAART naive patient remain establish . In nationwide cohort HIV infect patient , identified patient , initiate raltegravir due virological failure match control cohort patient initiate HAART first time . We compare two cohort respect virological suppression , gain CD4 count time first change initial regimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Raltegravir cohort patient : From Danish HIV Cohort Study ( DHCS ) include HIV1 positive patient , 1. start raltegravir 1 January 2006 1 July 2009 , 2. treat HAART previously 3. least two VL test do prior initiation raltegravir treatment , 4. virological failure prior start raltegravir 5. participate randomize clinical trial raltegravir . Virological failure define VL &gt; 500 copies/ml two late VL test prior raltegravir initiation HAART treatment . Control cohort patient : From DHCS identify control cohort HIV infect patient start HAART first time 1 January 2006 1 July 2009 . From population extract two control patient raltegravir patient , matched gender , race ( Caucasian , Black ) , route HIV infection ( homosexual , heterosexual , injection drug user ( IDU ) ) age ( interval &lt; 20 year , 20 30 year , 30 40 year , &gt; 50 year ) .</criteria>
