	<brief_title>Evaluating Strategies Reduce Mother-to-Child Transmission HIV Infection Resource-Limited Countries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV decrease recent year United States , Europe , resource-advantaged country . Several factor contribute decrease , include administration HAART pregnancy , caesarean section delivery method , use formula instead breastfeed feed infant . However , resource-limited country , incidence pediatric HIV infection remain high . Many pregnant woman country receive adequate course HAART , majority breastfeed child . The PROMISE study evaluate effective method prevent transmission HIV mother baby pregnancy , labor delivery , breastfeed . This version PROMISE study conduct research site eastern southern Africa part world breastfeed common . This study divide three component ( Antepartum , Postpartum , Maternal Health Components ) . Each component include three step ( Steps 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Following description component study , three step within component : 1 . Antepartum Component : This part study compare safety effectiveness different HAART regimens prevent transmission HIV pregnancy , labor , delivery . Pregnant HIV-infected woman randomly assign one follow three group : Arm A : Participants receive zidovudine ( ZDV ) + single dose nevirapine ( sdNVP ) + emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( Truvada [ TRV ] ) tail . Participants receive ZDV study entry delivery , sdNVP TRV intrapartum , TRV postpartum 7 day Week 1 visit , whichever later . Arm B : Participants receive lamivudine ( 3TC ) -zidovudine ( ZDV ) + lopinavir ( LPV ) -ritonavir ( RTV ) . Participants receive triple ARV study drug regimen study entry Week 1 visit ( 6-14 day postpartum ) . Arm C : Participants receive TRV/LPV-RTV . Participants receive triple ARV study drug regimen study entry Week 1 visit ( 6-14 day postpartum ) . Fixed-dose FTC-TDF-RPV ( Complera ) may use alternative first-line regimen mother able tolerate adhere LPV-RTV ATV-RTV . The FTC-TDF-RPV regimen define protocol determine discretion staff study site . All infant bear woman enrol study receive NVP day 42 day age Week 6 study visit , whichever later , regardless study arm mother enrol . Should woman need HAART switch HAART regimens health , move Step 2 Step 3 part study . During pregnancy , participant attend study visit study entry , 2 4 week entry , every 4 week labor delivery . Women infant monitor labor delivery attend study visit 6 14 day delivery . Study staff discus three part study participant decide eligible enroll . Follow-up visit occur Weeks 1 , 6 , 10 , 14 . Thereafter , month infant every 3 month woman . Each study visit include medical history review , questionnaire , interview , physical exam , blood collection , breast milk collection ( breastfeed ) . 2 . Postpartum Component : This part study compare safety effectiveness different HAART regimens prevent HIV infection infant breastfed HIV-infected mother . Participants randomly assign one two arm : Arm A : Women receive LPV-RTV plus TRV Week 1 postpartum visit end maternal follow-up ( 2 5 year ) . Infants receive NVP day 6 week ( 42 day ) age . Arm B : Infants receive NVP day 6 ( 14 ) day age long risk MTCT end follow-up ( 104 week ) . Until infant 6 month age , study visit occur month . After , study visit occur every 3 month . Study visit include medical history review , questionnaire , physical exam , blood collection , breast milk collection . Should woman need HAART switch HAART regimens health , move Step 2 Step 3 part study . If woman initiate HAART , NVP infant discontinue mother HAART 12 week viral load suppress undetectable level , whichever come first . As part optional substudy , study researcher may collect hair sample woman infant study visit measure antiretroviral drug concentration present hair . Another optional substudy examine antibody responses plasma breast milk participant . No additional study visit procedure require substudy . 3 . Maternal Health Component : This part study examine woman receive triple ARV regimen pregnancy breastfeed good health outcome woman discontinue triple ARV regimen . Participants include woman receive triple ARV regimen Postpartum Component receive triple ARV regimen Antepartum Component ineligible Postpartum Component . Participants randomly assign one two study arm : Arm A : Participants continue receive triple ARV regimen ( TRV LPV-RTV ) . Arm B : Participants discontinue triple ARV regimen . Study visit occur Weeks 4 12 every 3 month thereafter . Study visit include medical history review , questionnaire , physical exam , blood collection . Should woman need triple ARV regimen switch triple ARV regimens health , move Step 2 Step 3 part study . As part optional substudy , study researcher may collect hair sample woman certain study visit measure antiretroviral drug concentration present hair . The total duration three study component 5 year . Women remain study follow-up 2 5 year , depend enroll . Infants remain study 74 104 week age . Follow-up woman infant complete end September 2016 . As October 1 , 2014 , participant longer enrol three component study . Women complete one Antepartum Component regimens refer care accord standard care postpartum woman country . Study-supplied drug may provide woman drug available country 's standard care woman health care provider decide continue study drug would best interest .</detailed_description>
