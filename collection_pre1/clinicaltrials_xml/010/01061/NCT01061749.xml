	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study safety best dose selumetinib cixutumumab treat patient advance solid malignancy . Selumetinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry [ cancer/tumor ] -killing substance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety toxicity combination AZD6244 IMC-A12 advance solid tumor progress standard therapy . II . Finding maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended phase II dose combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore preliminary evidence efficacy combination AZD6244 IMC-A12 advance solid tumor use RECIST criterion tumor response . II . Define pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile combination IMC-A12 AZD6244 . III . Correlate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) combination IMC-A12 AZD6244 pharmacodynamic ( PD ) endpoint . IV . Assess PK/PD ( phospho-S6 ) link AZD6244 administer combination IMC-A12 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study selumetinib cixutumumab . Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
