	<brief_title>CT-FIRST : Cardiac Computed Tomography Versus Stress Imaging For Initial Risk STratification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current evaluation chest pain low intermediate risk patient typically start functional assessment coronary ischemia . Exercise treadmill test often select initial diagnostic modality coronary artery function . However , exercise treadmill test limited modest sensitivity specificity , often result cardiac resource utilization patient risk stratification reassurance . Additionally , many patient chest pain candidate regular stress test due abnormal baseline electrocardiogram inability exercise . Therefore , exercise pharmacologic stress image consider standard care evaluation coronary artery function large percentage patient chest pain . However , currently available stress image test well-documented limitation , result sizeable number false negative false positive study . With advent coronary Multislice Computed Tomography ( MSCT ) angiography , coronary artery anatomy accurately evaluate noninvasively . Despite impressive performance characteristic , role coronary MSCT angiography evaluation angina remain undefined . Furthermore , study compare MSCT stress image lack . CT-FIRST compare impact downstream resource utilization patient outcomes initial diagnostic strategy employ addition coronary MSCT angiography stress imaging ( exercise pharmacologic stress echo nuclear perfusion test ) standard-of-care diagnostic strategy stress image evaluation low-intermediate risk patient possible angina . The study single center , prospective , non-blinded , randomized clinical trial .</detailed_description>

Referred either stress echocardiogram nuclear stress perfusion study . Ability provide inform consent . Presence known preexist coronary artery disease ( know prior myocardial infarction , ECG evidence prior infarction , prior angiographic evidence significant coronary artery disease , history prior coronary revascularization ) . Previous outpatient inpatient evaluation coronary artery disease include exercise treadmill test , stress echocardiography nuclear myocardial perfusion study within last 24 month . Presence sign symptoms clearly compatible noncardiac chest pain , include musculoskeletal , gastrointestinal neuropathic cause . Renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl ) renal failure require dialysis .
