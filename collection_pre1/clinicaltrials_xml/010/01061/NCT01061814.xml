	<brief_summary>Hypercholesterolemia characterize markedly elevate low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . Elevated LDL major risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Mipomersen antisense drug reduces protein liver cell call apolipoprotein B-100 ( apoB-100 ) . ApoB-100 plays role produce low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) ( 'bad ' cholesterol ) move liver one 's bloodstream . High LDL-C independent risk factor development coronary heart disease ( CHD ) diseases blood vessel . It show lower LDL-C reduces risk heart attack major adverse cardiovascular event . Mipomersen investigational product study determine safe effective lower LDL-C specific population patient hypercholesterolemia . This phase 1 study conduct evaluate 3 different dose regimen ( daily , 3 time per week , weekly ) healthy volunteer total 3 week dose . Study procedure include blood test physical examination ass safety tolerability different regimen . Tests also do determine much drug present circulation ( blood flow body ) . Specific pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test blood sample determine body investigational product inject , include absorb , distribute , rate drug action begin duration effect . Eligible subject receive study injection either mipomersen placebo 3 week period follow 12 week safety follow-up period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double blind placebo-controlled , parallel-group , single center Phase 1 study investigate relative bioavailability , PK , safety , tolerability different sc dose regimen mipomersen healthy volunteer . The bioavailability 2 test regimen ( Cohorts A B ) assess relative reference treatment regimen ( Cohort C ) . Approximately 84 subject randomize equally 1 3 treatment regimen randomize 3:1 ratio mipomersen vs. placebo : Cohort A/Test Treatment Regimen 1 : 28 subject receive 30 mg sc dose study drug matching volume placebo daily 3 week ( 21 dos ; 630 mg total ) Cohort B/Test Treatment Regimen 2 : 28 subject receive 70 mg sc dose study drug matching volume placebo 3 time week 3 week ( 9 dos ; 630 mg total ) Cohort C/Reference Treatment Regimen : 28 subject receive 200 mg sc dose study drug matching volume placebo week 3 week ( 3 dos ; 600 mg total ) Each subject participate â‰¤ 6-week screening period , 3-week treatment period , 12-week safety follow-up period .</detailed_description>
