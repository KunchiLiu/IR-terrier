	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose dalteparin give together sunitinib malate treat patient kidney cancer spread part body remove surgery . Anticoagulants , dalteparin , help prevent blood clot show increase survival patient cancer . Anticoagulants may also prevent formation new blood vessel . Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth inhibit new blood vessel block blood flow tumor . Giving dalteparin together sunitinib malate may starve tumor kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dalteparin Sunitinib Malate First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended dose combination sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) dalteparin patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . II . To evaluate safety tolerability combination sunitinib dalteparin patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . III . To determine early sign clinical activity combination sunitinib dalteparin patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical response rate sunitinib dalteparin patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . II . To determine time-to-progression ( TTP ) overall survival amongst patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma receive sunitinib dalteparin . III . To determine effect sunitinib alone dalteparin alone compare combination dalteparin plus sunitinib plasma coagulation parameter . IV . To determine effect sunitinib alone dalteparin alone compare combination dalteparin plus sunitinib angiogenesis parameter blood . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study dalteparin . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) week 1-4 dalteparin subcutaneously ( SC ) QD week 6 course 1 . In subsequent course , patient receive sunitinib malate PO QD week 1-4 dalteparin SC QD week 1-6 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
