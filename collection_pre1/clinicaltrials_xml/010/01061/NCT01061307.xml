	<brief_summary>Iron , zinc vitamin A deficiency particularly common among child young woman develop country South Southeast Asia result important adverse health effect . Simultaneous fortification rice iron , zinc vitamin A could novel sustainable approach control deficiency . Recently conduct extrusion trial demonstrate extruded rice grain contain iron , zinc vitamin A show acceptable stability production storage good sensory property . The grain produce use twin-screw extruder equip special cutter rice shape die . The Fe , Zn vitamin A content extrude product 10 mg , 9 mg 1050 μg per g rice , respectively . In study investigator plan test efficacy extrude triple fortified rice Satun , Thailand , area rice staple food . Preliminary data area show zinc vitamin A intakes low . Biochemical indicator confirm zinc deficiency suboptimal vitamin A status 1/3 school age child . The efficacy fortify rice evaluate 9 month , control , double-blind intervention trial 7-12 y-old child . Children select primary school Satun Province base low serum zinc value primary goal investigate Zn efficacy . As secondary outcome effect iron vitamin A status investigate . The child randomize two group : control group receive daily non-fortified rice lunch meal school , second group receive daily rice meal contain triple fortified rice . The rice meal give 5 day week . At baseline , weight height measure determination hemoglobin , serum ferritin , zinc protoporphyrin , serum zinc , serum retinol C-reactive protein do . At mid-point 9 month , baseline measurement repeat judge efficacy triple fortified rice .</brief_summary>
