	<brief_summary>The primary objective study ass PK/PD responsiveness basal ID administer insulin compare SC , determine safety local tolerability extend ( two six-hour period ) microneedle insulin delivery ( MID ) infusion . The primary endpoint PK response change rapid-acting insulin basal infusion rate . Faster PK transition couple faster PD responsiveness could provide clinical benefit , compare current subcutaneous insulin infusion . In addition , nocturnal basal pumping , rapid insulin offset could decrease occurrence rate severity hypoglycemic episode .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty ( 20 ) male T1 diabetic subject study manual partial glucose clamp condition 16 hour infusion period ( approximately 36 hour overall time clinic ) . Subjects admit clinic night study visit overnight stabilization , via insulin and/or glucose infusion , blood glucose stabilize approximately 140 mg/dL . Subjects receive background IV Humulin insulin initial dose equivalent one-half usual daily basal insulin dose . In morning subject start experimental intervention administer low rate stair-stepped Lispro insulin infusion profile via infusion pump ( Harvard Syringe Pump , Harvard Apparatus ) . The profile design examine initial `` '' rate microneedle insulin delivery , transition time basal rate change `` off-rate '' insulin cessation . Subjects receive profile SC infusion second clinic day randomize order . PK endpoint establish use time blood sample . Safety tolerability local infusion site also record . In parallel , use commercially available insulin pump ( One Touch `` Ping '' Insulin Pump , Animas ) infusion set ( either RCS commercially available SC insulin infusion set ) ; second infusion insulin diluent use assess feasibility longer-term ID infusion ( 16 hour ) compare SC . During infusion pump control fluid delivery rate volume . In addition in-line pressure transducer record pressure transfer information laptop computer . Primary Objective : - To define PK profile initiation , rate change , discontinuation continuously infuse basal insulin administer either intradermally subcutaneously two separate infusion period . Secondary Objectives : - Determine PD effect infuse insulin measure time glucose rebound follow discontinuation test insulin infusion . - Assess safety tolerability intradermally infused insulin two six-hour period . - Assess feasibility research catheter set ( RCS ) longer-term ID infusion</detailed_description>
