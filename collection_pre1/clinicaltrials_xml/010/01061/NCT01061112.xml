	<brief_summary>This research study help determine person 's genetic makeup affect responses drug , ability body break drug , potential experience interaction drug . We investigate drug interaction antifungal drug call fluconazole commonly use drug tolbutamide , flurbiprofen , ketoprofen . Tolbutamide use management Type 2 diabetes . Both flurbiprofen ketoprofen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) often use arthritis pain . We interested study whether individual certain genetic profile different drug interaction normal . This research do see certain genetic profile require u adjust medication dos differently need general population . Genetic profile subject determine previous participation Pharmacogenetics Registry ( Investigator Richard Brundage , University Minnesota ) . The study hypothesis : Fraction metabolize CYP2C9 enzyme determines extent drug interaction CYP2C9*1/*1 individual factor ( fraction metabolize ) become less influential drug interaction attenuate gene-dose dependent manner individual one defective allele .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis : Fraction metabolize CYP2C9 enzyme determines extent drug interaction CYP2C9*1/*1 individual factor ( fraction metabolize ) become less influential drug interaction attenuate gene-dose dependent manner individual one defective allele . Objective : Examine extent fluconazole inhibition drug vary degree fraction metabolize CYP2C9 individual CYP2C9*1/*1 , CYP2C9*1/*3 CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype . People differ genetic makeup . This include difference gene involve drug metabolism , transport , effect body . People certain genetic profile produce alter enzyme , transporter , receptor may respond different way drug . Altered enzymes cause drug break different rate normal . As result , drug concentration build blood , increase risk side effect . Furthermore , two drug take together , possibility exists drug interact , one drug cause change metabolism drug . It know whether people alter genetic makeup also alter experience drug interaction . Altered drug transporter affect absorption elimination drug compare normal cause difference long drug stay body . Finally , alter drug receptor respond differently drug , thus , produce alter desire undesired effect . In study , investigate drug interaction antifungal drug call fluconazole commonly use drug tolbutamide , flurbiprofen , ketoprofen subject three different allele CYP2C9 genotype . Tolbutamide use management Type 2 diabetes . Both flurbiprofen ketoprofen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) often use arthritis pain . We interested study whether individual certain genetic profile different drug interaction normal . This research do see certain genetic profile require u adjust medication dos differently need general population . The cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) superfamily enzymes play important role oxidative conversion numerous xenobiotics hydrophilic metabolite . CYP2C9 , important member CYP superfamily , account 10-20 % CYP protein content human liver catalyze approximately 20 % CYP mediate drug oxidation reaction , include tolbutamide non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) ketoprofen flurbiprofen . It well establish genetic factor play important role control CYP2C9 expression activity . In particular , *3 allele express allele frequency 15 % . Homozygotic *3 individual exhibit significantly reduce oral clearance several CYP2C9 substrate . In case , reduction clearance approach 80 % even heterozygotic individual , reduction clearance 40-50 % due co-dominant expression CYP2C9 . This reduction clearance associate increased frequency adverse event follow warfarin phenytoin administration , two clinically important drug exhibit narrow therapeutic index . The therapeutic index comparison amount therapeutic agent cause therapeutic effect amount cause toxic effect .</detailed_description>
