	<brief_summary>The purpose study create prospective database patient myeloma affect spine . This database define change health-related quality life time , effect incident fracture treatment specific measure pain , physical function , pulmonary function , future fracture . In 2008 , UCSF Myeloma Service actively care 347 patient myeloma , 150 patient lytic lesion radiographs , 100 know vertebral fracture . This population , well new myeloma patient , serve source study population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The UCSF Adult Hematology Program maintain data base patient diagnosis multiple myeloma see Clinic . As patient treat , relapse , receive new treatment , transplant , pass away , data enter Multiple Myeloma Data Base ( MMDB ) . The MMDB expand include parameter identify patient myeloma affect spine . A recruitment letter send patient MMDB identify myeloma affect spine ask would interested participate study . Patients agree participate study give appointment meet Dr. Wolf Dr. Martin discus study willing , sign inform consent document . They exam history take include fracture history . Patients sign consent send thoracic-lumbar spine film ( unless prior spine film take within last 3 month ) . Those normal film eligible enrolled study . Those abnormal spinal film send MRI spine , pulmonary function testing , meet Dr. R. Yonge administer various QOL test describe . All eligible establish new patient invite participate prospective study . Patients sign inform consent include prospective study . A minimum 25 patient vertebral fracture 25 patient without fracture , observed measure impact fracture health-related quality life . Study enrollment complete 25 patient without new fracture 25 patient new fracture treat balloon kyphoplasty enrol .</detailed_description>
