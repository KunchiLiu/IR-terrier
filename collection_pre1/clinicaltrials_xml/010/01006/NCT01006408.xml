	<brief_title>Treatment Trial Using Low Level Laser Therapy ( LLLT ) Treatment Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LLLT technique apply low energy low-level laser tissue . It use trigger tissue increase cellular production give low-level , cold light energy . This low level energy pass skin , cell membrane produce process call photobiostimulation . LLLT work capture increase beneficial wavelength light . These laser cut burn , instead penetrate skin . This process multiple effect cell enhance body 's natural regenerative function . It also stimulate release endorphins collagen . Endorphins work `` natural pain reliever '' produce body strenuous workout , excitement pain . Collagen natural substance within body tissue . This single center trial conduct Legacy Health System . Twenty patient Legacy Health System chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy enrol study . Arm 1 receive LLLT twice week total eight week . Arm 2 follow crossover study design patient receive sham ( fake ) LLLT twice week first four week , follow true LLLT twice week four week , ( total 8 week ) . Each patient Arm 2 serve comparison purpose examine effect LLLT . Both arm follow-up visit follow last treatment .</detailed_description>
