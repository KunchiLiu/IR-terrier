	<brief_title>Efficacy &amp; Safety Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination Glioblastoma Multiforme After Complete Surgical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , open-label , unicentric phase II trial , historical control non-randomized . The study try evaluate efficiency safety experimental treatment use cell therapy product ( tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine ) patient glioblastoma multiforme gross total resection feasible . Patients receive standard first-line therapy ( surgery radio-chemotherapy ) along experimental treatment . The experimental treatment consist subcutaneous vaccination suspension autologous dendritic cell ( cell patient ) produce cell culture monocytes patient extracted leukapheresis pulse lysate patient´s tumoral tissue . The first four vaccine administer monthly basis , concomitantly standard chemo radiotherapy treatment , next four vaccine , every month four last vaccination every three months.The result obtain compare historical control study , patient receive standard treatment without experimental vaccine .</detailed_description>

Age 18 70 year Negative pregnancy test In female fertile subject Patient , investigator 's opinion , willing able comply protocol requirement . Complete/Total resection tumour surgery guide fluorescence microscopy 5aminolevulinic acid , observe post operative magnetic resonance imaging . The residual lesion must null ≤ 1 cm3 contrast capturing . Enough tumor tissue available cellular vaccine elaboration Patients infection , severe disease hepatic , renal medullary failure , investigator 's opinion , eligible participate study . Participation clinical trial . If patient participate clinical trial within previous month , patient complete washout period require de investigator . Patients diagnosis neoplasia , except basal cell squamous cell skin , carcinoma situ cervix properly treat tumour curatively treat evidence relapse least 3 year . Those case coexist tumours longterm survival prediction consider individually . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Patients need immunosuppressive drug . Positive serology HIV , hepatitis B ( HBsAg ) hepatitis C virus . Impossible get enough material least 6 cellular vaccine production . Absolute contraindication patient receive step standard treatment glioblastoma ( surgery , radio chemotherapy )</criteria>
