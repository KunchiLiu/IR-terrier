	<brief_title>Role Coumadin Preventing Thromboembolism Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) Patients Undergoing Catheter Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia encounter clinical practice , affect 2.3 million people United States ( 1 ) . A major cause stroke , AF substantially increase risk thromboembolism necessitate oral anticoagulation therapy ( OAT ) high-risk patient . Radiofrequency percutaneous catheter ablation ( RFCA ) effective strategy treatment symptomatic drug-refractory atrial fibrillation . However , periprocedural cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) due thrombus air embolism remain one serious complication AF ablation . In spite precaution take , , ablation minimize risk CVA , report event rate remain 0.5-2.8 % ( 2 ) . The incidence thromboembolic event dependent extensiveness ablation procedure well periprocedural anticoagulation strategy ( 2 ) . Some study describe char soft thrombus formation temperature exceed 100 degree C RFCA , probably cause blood protein denaturation coagulation ( 3 ) . Currently open saline irrigation-tip ablation catheter ( 3.5 mm Thermocool catheter ) use reduces thermal injury keep temperature control ( 4 ) , enable operator use high wattage RF energy effectively ablate arrhythmogenic focus . The two utilized periprocedural OAT strategy ; 1 ) discontinuation Coumadin three five day prior ablation , utilization heparin enoxaparin procedure , `` bridge '' low molecular weight heparin Coumadin ablation , 2 ) RFCA continuation Coumadin , procedure ( 2 ) without change dosage . Limited data available regard risk thromboembolism without periprocedural Coumadin AF patient undergo catheter ablation .The aim prospective randomize study evaluate effect two OAT strategy incidence TE within 48 hour post-RFCA . Patient Selection , Treatment Follow-up Period : Patients randomize study group would continue Coumadin without periprocedural change undergo catheter ablation . Those randomized control group would discontinue Coumadin 3-4 day prior ablation replace heparin till end procedure bridge LMWH Coumadin 48-72 hour ablation . An INR 2-3 would ascertain patient prior procedure . Patients subtherapeutic INR would include study . Procedure : Coumadin therapy would start least two month prior ablation order achieve therapeutic INR least three week prior procedure . Anticoagulation strategy I ( Coumadin interrupt ) : Twice daily even prior ablation procedure , 0.5-1 mg/kg enoxaparin would administer bridged Coumadin . At time procedure , enoxaparin would replace heparin . At end procedure , sheath would remove full anticoagulation . After procedure heparin would discontinue , protamine 10 15 mg would give . Sheaths would pull activated clotting time ( ACT ) would &lt; 250 second . Aspirin 325 mg would give patient leaf electrophysiology laboratory . Warfarin would administer even pulmonary vein isolation . Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID 0.5 mg/kg BID would routinely start would stop INR &gt; 2 . Patients LSPAF , leave ventricular dysfunction history thrombo-embolism would receive overlap anticoagulation enoxaparin three day procedure . The remain patient would receive double dose Coumadin night ablation follow routine pre-procedure dose next day . Anticoagulation strategy II ( continuous Coumadin ) : Coumadin would discontinue group patient . The INR would monitor every week four week precede ablation 2.0 . All patient AF day procedure INR 2 demonstrable four consecutive week precede procedure would undergo TEE . PVAI would do Coumadin treatment . No heparin enoxaparin would administer patient prior procedure . Before transseptal puncture , heparin bolus ( 100 150 U/Kg ) would administer patient . During procedure , infusion rate would adjust keep activated clotting time range 350 450 sec . After procedure , heparin infusion would stop anticoagulation would reverse 10 15 mg Protamine , sheath would pull activated clotting time le 250 sec . Patients would receive 325 mg Aspirin leave EP lab . They would continue Coumadin dosage regimen change procedure aim INR 2 3 . Following randomization , patient consider treatment period 2 month procedure 48-72 hour procedure . Ablation Procedure : Standard radiofrequency catheter ablation procedure base physician 's discretion would follow . All patient undergo baseline post-procedure MRI within 24-hours procedure . Follow-up period 48 hour post-procedure ; patient would neurologic evaluation ; end procedure every four hour next 48 hour . Clinical neurologic evaluation would include assessment mental status ability pay attention , memory , judgment orientation self , place time ; maneuver test cranial nerve , assessment motor function test strength different muscle group assessment sensory function evaluate touch , pain , vibration positional awareness well deep tendon reflex . Patients questionable neurologic impairment would undergo neuroimaging evaluation like head CT MRI .</detailed_description>
