	<brief_summary>Anaphylaxis severe potentially life threaten allergic reaction affect airway , breathe and/or circulation . This reaction trigger number different allergen common food , medication , insect venom latex . Because reaction occur suddenly potentially serious , best management lie correct use prescribed emergency medication . Epinephrine , adrenaline commonly know , recommended drug treatment anaphylaxis . Injecting epinephrine outer thigh muscle prefer route administration . For health professional , patient carers , rapid administration facilitate manufacture preloaded syrinx autoinjector . Despite availability device , review study show poor knowledge skill amongst health professional patient regard use autoinjectable epinephrine device correctly . These study find well poor knowledge use autoinjector , lack confidence amongst patient unwillingness carry device time . In disease group like asthma diabetes , psychological model involve ask people think illness relate behaviour , find help understand people follow adhere health professional advice others .

	<brief_title>Adherence Self-care Regimens Young People With Food Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Cross-sectional comparison Self Regulatory Model ( Leventhal , 1984 ) The Health Belief Model ( Rosenstock , 1966 ) model use predict understand adherence selfcare regimens adolescent young adult food allergy . Proposed Sample Size / Power Calculations : The power calculation base multiple regression analysis predictor variable , 25 total . To predict minimum 10 % variance adherence alpha=0.05 power=0.90 , minimum propose sample size 275 participant need . A 40 % attrition rate anticipate due use postal questionnaire minimum 459 participant need recruit . Analyses Nonparametric item response theory analysis , univariate correlation multiregressional analysis predictor model conduct . Structural equation modelling also apply assess goodness fit two social cognition model . Setting This study base outpatient set community . Participants identify recruited hospital allergy clinic either whilst attend appointment hospital mail . The third method recruitment involve participant convenience sample university Sussex Brighton . Procedure Phase 1 Recruitment consent The recruitment study participant involve three method . The first method involve recruit participant person hospital allergy clinic . Eligible individual identify clinic staff give participant information leaflet ask interested take part study . Once verbal consent give , participant direct chief investigator present clinic . Interested individual would opportunity discuss research chief investigator and/or clinic staff . If still interested , individual ( age 16-21 parent age 13-15 ) ask sign two consent form ( one copy keep ) give questionnaire . The participant give opportunity complete questionnaire within clinic , take home complete . If latter option chosen , freepost envelope address research team provide . Participants also give correspondence slip write contact detail return separately research team interest receive summary finding . The second method recruitment involve patient database search clinic staff subsequent mail eligible individual . Clinic staff search patient record individual fit inclusion criterion . The consultant charge confirm eligibility sign invitation letter prepare hospital head paper . This put envelope together participant information leaflet , two consent form ( one copy participant keep return ) , questionnaire , future correspondence slip freepost envelope address research team . The third method recruitment convenience sample Universities Sussex Brighton . A generic email send staff student consist participant information leaflet detail main inclusion criterion . Individuals eligible interested take part research ask reply email contact detail . Similarly recruit clinic mail , participant send pack contain another participant information leaflet , two consent form , questionnaire , correspondence slip freepost envelope address research team . Phase 2 - Questionnaire In order measure model , carefully construct piloted questionnaire develop . Each participant ask complete one questionnaire one occasion . The questionnaire collect demographic detail , ass knowledge use medication , confidence individual 's ability use medication , management food allergy , Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire ( Moss-Morris et al. , 2002 ) validate questionnaire measure item Self-Regulatory Model ( Leventhal , 1984 ) , item relate factor find within Health Belief Model ( Rosenstock , 1966 ) finally Revised Life Orientation Test ( Scheier et al. , 1994 ) . The questionnaire completion time confirm individual within target age range expect take long 40 minute complete . In order improve response rate questionnaire , second mail send eligible participant one month initial mail . Phase 3 - Feedback participant Those participant express interest receiving summary finding provide contact detail send summary document upon completion study . Measures Demographic/background Participants ask age , gender , ethnicity , size family , history food allergy anaphylaxis , use emergency medication autoinjectable epinephrine , membership allergy support group , possession management plan food allergy . Knowledge Knowledge use autoinjectable epinephrine device measure individual confidence ability correctly also look . This enable u explore whether underuse result poor knowledge whether good explain factor . Adherence Adherence measure ask participant current method manage food allergy . This include question allergen avoidance carry emergency medication ( auto-injectable epinephrine additional medicine may use treat food allergy ) . Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire ( Moss-Morris et al. , 2002 ) , Health Belief Model ( Rosenstock , 1966 ) item Revised Life Orientation Test ( Scheier et al. , 1994 ) The Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire ( Moss-Morris et al. , 2002 ) measure construct Self-Regulatory Model ( Leventhal , 1984 ) include symptom , duration food allergy , consequence food allergy , personal control individual feel food allergy , amount individual feel treatment control food allergy , emotion associate food allergy , much comprehend food allergy believe cause . The Health Belief Model ( Rosenstock , 1966 ) similarly look attitude case susceptible serious individual feel suffer allergic reaction would , barrier benefit follow recommended advice prompt individual follow advice . The Revised Life Orientation Test ( Scheier et al. , 1994 ) also measure determine level optimism find study impact way participant respond item questionnaire .</detailed_description>
