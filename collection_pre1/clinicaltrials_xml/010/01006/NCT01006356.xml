	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Hydromorphone Hydrochloride ( HCl ) Oral Osmotic System ( OROS ) Reduction Breakthrough Pain Medication Frequency Participants With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multi-center ( conducted 1 center ) , prospective ( study follow participant forward time ) study . The total duration study 3 week . The study consist 2 period 4 visit : screening period ( 1 week ; Visit 1 ) treatment period ( 2 week ; Visit 2 , 3 4 ) . During screen period Visit 1 , potential participant receive previously administer oral opioid analgesic second visit immediate-release opioid analgesic whenever breakthrough pain present . During treatment period , second visit fourth visit , participant receive hydromorphone HCl OROS daily 2 week . At Investigator 's discretion , participant complete 2 week treatment study drug could enrol extension phase 12-weeks . The dose study drug flexible increase decrease base frequency immediate-release opioid analgesic dos need manage pain . At second visit , initial dose hydromorphone determine accord equivalent analgesic effect conversion tablet ( oxycodone 10 milligram [ mg ] twice daily equal hydromorphone HCl 8 mg daily ) . The Investigator increase participant 's daily dose 3 breakthrough pain episode require rescue medication within 24 hour period . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
