	<brief_summary>The investigator propose establish Biorepository diseased normal tissue collect subject undergo surgery solid tumor resection . In cooperation Scripps Cancer registry , investigator also establish anonymized database correspond clinical information include response treatment , disease status , recurrence . The Biorepository Scripps Health able process , preserve , distribute sample scientific medical researcher Scripps .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Biorepository Scripps Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biorepository sample utilized variety research study intend help diagnosis and/or treatment patient , include possible identification therapeutic target genetic identifier cancer possibly disease . Various technology include gene expression , genotyping , DNA RNA sequencing , protein metabolite analysis may use course various study An exemplary project currently consideration one Scripps Genomic Medicine compare DNA sequence patient 's tumor germline DNA identify genetic difference two . These difference could help identify specific pathway regulate tumor disease thus lead potentially valuable information treat individual patient well patient similar genetic characteristic . In addition , difference tumor germ-line observed multiple patient could help identify therapeutic target cancer specific . A secondary exemplary project currently underway one Scripps Genomic Medicine undertake RNA sequence identify `` fusion gene '' hybrid gene form two previously separate gene type genetic mutation identify certain type cancer include prostate breast certain form leukemia . Identifying new fusion gene could provide valuable insight treatment protocols new therapeutic target . The goal project expand improve bio-repository already establish within Scripps Genomic Medicine ( SGM ) group . Presently , collection focus collection predominately prostate tumor blood correspond normal tissue . The current collection annotate pathology information limit medical information collect patient consent process ; post surgical information collect . We believe collection enhance ( ) modify tumor collection process , ( ii ) simplifying mean consent patient relies upon general surgical consent ( iii ) use de-identified medical data already consolidated Cancer registry mean annotate tissue sample .</detailed_description>

I understand tissue remove may use teaching purpose well research , institutional commercial '' . ) Does meet inclusion criterion .</criteria>
