	<brief_title>Sugammadex Neostigmine Residual Neuromuscular Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle relaxant integral part modern anesthesia . They optimize intubate condition , reduce laryngeal trauma improve operating condition . Drawback possible pharmacological ( muscle relax ) effect drug beyond end operation ( i.e . post-operative residual curarization : PORC ) . Reportedly 30 % patient receive muscle relaxant show sign PORC arrive post-anesthesia care unit . PORC comprise risk impair post-operative fine motor coordinative skill possible impairment swallow pharyngeal secretion increase risk aspiration extubation . Possible deleterious effect could pneumonia , bronchitis , myocardial infarction , cardiac insufficiency , stroke re-operation . In order avoid PORC patient residual neuromuscular block receive muscle relaxant antagonist anesthesiologist end operation . However , drug ( neostigmine , pyridostigmine , etc . ) class cholinesterase inhibitor unwanted effect bradycardia , increase gastro-intestinal motility , post-operative nausea vomiting , salivation etc . To decrease unwanted side effect cholinesterase inhibitor give combination parasympatholyics e.g . atropine glycopyrrolate spectrum unwanted side effect . From October 2008 , Sugammadex , completely new reversal drug introduce clinical practice . Sugammadex , modify γ-cyclodextrine able specifically bind rocuronium ( steroidal muscle relaxant ) . The complex eliminate via kidney . However , study far focus reversal profound deep neuromuscular blockade . This study design compare recovery time reversal residual neuromuscular block ( TOF-ratio 0.2 ) different dos either neostigmine sugammadex .</detailed_description>
