	<brief_summary>Background : - Most time , human make decision accord consequence , especially beneficial , avoid try avoid action bad outcome . The way brain prepares movement study detail , way brain make decision carry action still poorly understood . Researchers interested learn decision-making process affect brain . Objectives : - To record activity brain decision-making process . Eligibility : - Healthy , right-handed volunteer 18 40 year age . Design : - Potential participant screen visit medical history neurological examination determine eligibility . - This study require seven visit : one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) visit 6 magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) record visit . The MEG record visit include transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . All visit space least 1 week apart . Total participation last 6 week . - Participants MRI scan first study visit . - The MEG procedure record brain activity series computer test involve win lose money . TMS perform visit , separate test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recording Modulation Neuronal Mechanisms During Operant Conditioning : MEG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study cerebral activity associate reward-related decision making . We plan analyze localize electrical activity brain related process magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . We also want modulate activity area use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . We would like analyze consequence procedure brain activity behavioral performance . This protocol provide new information cortical region involve decision-making area communicate one another . Study population : 50 right-handed adult healthy volunteer . Design : A probabilistic reversal task perform : subject choose pair stimuli associate change probability reward loss . Using MEG , cerebral activity record task performance . Since want modulate cortical activity cerebral area involve reward-related decision making , study carry 8 different visit ( screen visit , structural MRI acquisition 6 recording visit ) . In one visit , decision-making study previous cortical stimulation . In 3 visit , decision-making studied stimulation one 3 region interest . In one visit , decision-making studied stimulation cortical area think involved process . Lastly , decision-making analyze follow sham stimulation test possible placebo effect rTMS . Outcome measure : Outcome measure follow : 1 . Task-related : reaction time error rate task performance . 2 . MEG signal : scalp source coherence cortical region , amplitude latency event-related potential even-related ( de ) synchronization .</detailed_description>
