	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine impact hepatic steatosis replace premeal rapid-acting insulin exenatide ( Byetta ) maintain bedtime long-acting detemir ( Levemir ) insulin well-controlled patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Secondary aim learn : 1 ) efficacy safety approach whether acceptable treatment strategy compare intensified insulin therapy alone ; 2 ) mechanism action ( effect insulin secretion insulin action ) ; 3 ) impact weight ( prevent insulin-associated weight gain cause weight loss ) rate hypoglycemia ; 4 ) may improve specific plasma biomarkers disease activity NAFLD inflammatory marker common condition - T2DM NAFLD ( hsCRP , ICAM , VCAM ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adding Exenatide Insulin Therapy Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) major public health problem United States ~2/3 Americans overweight frankly obese . Less well recognize obesity T2DM fueling another `` silent epidemic '' : non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . In NAFLD , hepatic fat accumulation range simple steatosis severe steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , necroinflammation fibrosis may progress cirrhosis . Indeed , 40 % patient NAFLD develop NASH ~15-20 % patient NASH develop cirrhosis 10 year . NASH believe common cause cryptogenic cirrhosis rank third lead indication liver transplantation alcohol hepatitis C. The distinction simple steatosis NASH do mean liver biopsy , strategy reduce fatty liver disease correlate reduction steatohepatitis fibrosis . It estimate ~1/3 general population United States fatty liver disease assess magnetic resonance image spectroscopy ( MRS ) , gold-standard technique . It also affect pediatric population , natural history remains define , biopsy show degree fibrosis cirrhosis report child young 10 year age . Moreover , investigator experience use MRS past several year , ~80 % patient T2DM NAFLD . If extrapolate overall population United States , ~15 million subject T2DM NAFLD 50 million overweight/obese individual NAFLD . As awareness NAFLD/NASH increase , health care provider confront unique challenge achieve good metabolic control treat fatty liver disease subject . Inadequate glycemic control appear worsen accelerate progression fatty liver disease . Paradoxically , patient T2DM reach establish treatment goal . Moreover , appear way metabolic control achieve important NAFLD : metformin may beneficial NASH pioglitazone highly effective , control hyperglycemia insulin therapy alone modest benefit hepatic fat accumulation . In addition , long-term insulin therapy T2DM frequently associate inadequate compliance , weight gain , frequent hypoglycemia overall poor patient satisfaction . This great concern ~35-40 % patient T2DM treat insulin . Therefore , unmet need find good way treat patient fail oral agent therapy , target hyperglycemia excessive liver fatty deposition . The investigator propose strategy add exenatide insulin therapy mean achieve good glycemic control ameliorate hepatic steatosis ( improve hepatic insulin sensitivity ) , reduce body weight/total body fat ( visceral fat ) , decrease risk hypoglycemia allow reduction insulin dos ( withdrawal premeal insulin dos , reduction basal long-acting insulin ) , enhance insulin secretion insulin action improve quality life patient T2DM NAFLD . As T2DM NAFLD become prevalent near future , pilot study likely set stage large control multicenter trial approach may effective intensified insulin therapy alone . The central hypothesis insulin resistance fat-overload play key role NAFLD/NASH , condition believe arise molecular level inability mitochondrion adapt fat oversupply . Excessive fatty acid flux exogenous ( dietary ) endogenous ( insulin resistant adipose tissue/increased lipolysis ) source drive hepatic lipogenesis . Exenatide would potentially good treatment fit hepatic steatosis decrease excess dietary intake substrate supply , reduce fat mass plasma FFA lower exogenous insulin need chronic hyperinsulinemia . Mitigating chronic hyperinsulinemia hyperglycemia important drive hepatic fat synthesis sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c ( SREBP-1c ) carbohydrate regulatory element-binding protein ( ChREBP ) activity , respectively . Weight loss may also subdue systemic inflammation generate dysfunctional adipose tissue , local ( hepatic ) level , ameliorate fat-induced mitochondrial dysfunction ( activation Kupffer cell , local production cytokine ) . While systematic study publish yet , exenatide show reverse hepatic steatosis obese animal model NAFLD case report 59 year old poorly control T2DM patient liver fat MRS reduce 15.8 % 4.3 % . Dietary intervention remain current standard care NAFLD , study general small , uncontrolled lead variable histological result . It widely accept weight loss difficult achieve even hard maintain long-term . Moreover , weight loss particularly difficult patient T2DM insulin therapy . Pharmacological therapy large ineffective NAFLD/NASH , include trial use antioxidant cytoprotective agent pentoxyfilline , vitamin E ursodeoxycholic acid . A modest benefit report small study metformin , study use pioglitazone show randomized , placebo-controlled trial , truly effective safe treatment patient IGT T2DM NASH . Considering impact NAFLD patient T2DM serious co-morbidity range metabolic impact glycemia dyslipidemia , potentially cause end-stage liver disease cardiovascular disease , rather surprising prior study focus novel pharmacological approach one propose treatment patient NAFLD T2DM .</detailed_description>
