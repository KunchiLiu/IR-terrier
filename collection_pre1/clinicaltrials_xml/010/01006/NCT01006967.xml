	<detailed_description>Falls lead cause fatal non-fatal injury elderly . Each year estimate 1/3 old adult fall , likelihood fall increase substantially advance age.2 In 2005 , 15,802 elderly patient ( &gt; 65 year age ) die result fall-related injury . According 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) survey , 5.8 million person age 65 old fell least 3 month period , represent nearly 16 percent elderly population ; furthermore , nearly third fell ( 1.8 million ) sustain form injury result either doctor 's visit restrict activity least 1 day . Falls thus represent major cause functional limitation disability elderly . In 2000 , direct medical cost fall-related injury estimate $ 19 billion . Our primary objective perform multi-center , randomize clinical trial evaluate comparative effectiveness perturbation-based dynamic stability intervention ( use ActiveStep® training system ) compare traditional physical therapy program reduce incidence severity fall geriatric population . Modifiable risk factor fall include muscle weakness , gait balance problem , poor vision , use psychoactive medication , home hazard . Most effective fall-prevention intervention focus exercise , either alone part multi-faceted program include medication management , vision correction home modification . One Tai Chi base program reduce risk fall 55 % randomized trial . While exercise program appear efficacy reduce fall risk , type , frequency duration exercise adequate significantly reduce risk fall remain unclear . External perturbation trip major contributor fall , trip-related fall account many 20 % hip fracture . The ActiveStep® fall prevention training program develop NIH funding consist series increasingly challenging postural disturbance use microprocessor control servo motor drive treadmill belt define acceleration , velocity , distance profile . Initial biomechanical test ActiveStep® training program show significant improvement trunk kinematics single training session . The ActiveStep® training program currently available billable Medicare reimbursement code ; however , lack clinical data show reduce falls patient ' routine activity well standard physical therapy intervention . The Specific Aims : 1 . Conduct multi-central randomized prospective trial compare standard physical therapy gait balance program perturbation-based dynamic stability intervention use ActiveStep® training system . The main outcome measure number subject report fall follow-up period . Secondary measure include number injurious fall subject ' self-reported balance confidence use Activities-specific Balance Confidence ( ABC ) scale . 2 . To assess longevity improvement two type fall prevention program assess fall every three month least two year . The data time first fall allow insight potential need time `` retrain '' fall prevention . 3 . To evaluate underlying patient characteristic may predict successful prevention fall treatment group thus help determine appropriate selection patient different type fall prevention program . Men woman 65 year old refer fall prevention physical therapy intervention eligible Randomized ActiveStep® Comparative Effectiveness Trial ( RACE Trial ) . Patients either prior fall score fall risk least one balance assessment measure describe . Following education study participation inform consent process , patient agree participate randomly assign either standard physical therapy gait-and-balance training ( PT ) PT+ActiveStep® one-to-one ratio . The study blind adequate sham-control ActiveStep® training ; however , allocation concealment ensure patient enrol . The final plan target enrollment 550 subject . At time enrollment , participant undergo fall risk assessment . This include several standard instrument include : Timed Up &amp; Go Test ( TUG ) ; 42 Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) ; 43 Berg Balance Measure . 44 In addition administer Activities-specific Balance Confidence ( ABC ) scale , questionnaire ass level self-confidence patient balance 16 specific activity . 45 This scale ass fall risk per se ass fear fall significant impact patient ' activity level quality life . The treatment protocol PT cohort consist current standard gait / balance train physical therapy described . The PT+ActiveStep® receive standard PT training inclusion number 15 minute session ActiveStep® simulator . The content standard PT ActiveStep® group adjust total number rehabilitation visit amount rehabilitation time group , take account maximum number allowable visit reimbursement . Thus , ActiveStep® substitute portion standard PT intervention . Following treatment phase , study subject contact telephone every 3 month duration study brief interview regard history fall significant change medical condition . The primary outcome measure study proportion subject report fall first 2 year follow-up . These assess use question BRFSS survey . Secondary outcome measure include time first report fall , total number fall , number injurious fall injury define per BRFSS survey result either doctor 's visit restrict activity least 1 day . Additionally , change TUG , Berg , DGI , ABC scale treatment also evaluate .</detailed_description>
