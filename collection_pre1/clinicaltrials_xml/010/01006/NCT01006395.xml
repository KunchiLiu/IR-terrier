	<brief_summary>Less 20 % men prostate cancer diagnose early die . Cardiovascular disease common cause death men early prostate cancer . A commonly used form treatment prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . ADT , effective treatment prostate cancer , link undesirable side effect , increase risk bone fracture diabetes . Bisphosphonates , class drug prevent bone resorption , show reduce loss bone mineral density occur consequence ADT , effect bisphosphonates preservation bone architecture unknown . This project two main goal : To assess prospectively , men prostate cancer receive ADT , effect : 1. intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acidon ADT-induced microarchitectural decay bone structure . 2 . ADT insulin resistance glucose metabolism . We recruit 100 ambulatory men non-metastatic prostate cancer commence three year course ADT per routine clinical practice Austin Health . Men randomise receive either intravenous zoledronic acid ( Aclasta , Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) placebo baseline 12 month ADT . Men contraindication zoledronic acid exclude study . All 100 study subject clinical laboratory assessment baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month ( study end ) , image study baseline 6 , 12 24 month . The study protocol outline detail ( Please see flow chart include PICF ) : Clinical laboratory assessment : Full medical history , physical examination quality life assessment use SF-36 questionnaire . Laboratory study include : oral glucose tolerance test ( 3 , 12 24 month Commercial-in-Confidence ) measurement measure total testosterone , fast glucose , C-peptide , HBA1c , bone turnover marker . Imaging study : 1 . Bony micro-architecture high resolution quantitative compute tomography 2 . Bone mineral density body composition DEXA This project direct benefit subject involve study ; however , improve understand effect zoledronic acid bone microarchitecture men prostate cancer receive ADT . It also help u good understand effect ADT insulin resistance glucose metabolism .</brief_summary>
