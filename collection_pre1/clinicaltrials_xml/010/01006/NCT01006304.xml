	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study Assess Effects JNJ-39439335 Relief Pain Using Thermal-Grill Experimental Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory study use thermal-grill experimental model assess effect JNJ-39439335 ( 50 mg , single oral dose ) relief pain . The study drug test healthy adult male find single 50 mg oral dose JNJ-39439335 better placebo ( inactive substance , like sugar pill ) relieve pain . Study volunteer experience pain sensation ( illusion pain ) result place palm hand small device consist harmless warm cool flat metal bar know thermal grill . Volunteers receive JNJ-39439335 match placebo study unit Day 1 2 treatment period . The treatment sequence volunteer assign randomly ( like flip coin ) . On dose day , pain sensation induce follow outcome measure assess dose 4 hour dose : ( 1 ) volunteer 's heat pain threshold [ HPT ] cold pain threshold [ CPT ] , i.e. , hot cold temperature begin elicit pain , ( 2 ) intensity unpleasantness pain sensation result simultaneous application warm temperature [ 4 C HPT ] cold temperature [ 4 C CPT ] , ( 3 ) intensity non-painful warm cold sensation follow application temperature 4 C HPT 4 C CPT , respectively , ( 4 ) intensity pain follow application temperature 2 C HPT 2 C CPT . All assessment perform constant room temperature approximately 21 C. During trial volunteer closely monitor safety , include evaluation adverse event , vital sign , 12-lead ECG , clinical laboratory testing ( hematology serum chemistry ) , full neurological examination . Two blood sample measurement JNJ-39439335 plasma concentration collect immediately immediately thermal-grill assessment . At approximately 6 hour post-dose , volunteer discharge study unit . The study duration volunteer approximately 9 week , include screen phase start within 3 week first study drug administration , washout least 3 week 2 treatment period , final follow-up visit take place approximately 3 week last study drug administration . Each volunteer receive single oral dose JNJ-39439335 ( 50 mg ) placebo tablet Day 1 2 treatment period . The study duration subject ~9 week .</detailed_description>
