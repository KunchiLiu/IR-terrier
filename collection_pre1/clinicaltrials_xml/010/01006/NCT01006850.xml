	<brief_summary>Research question : In adult emergency department ( ED ) patient attend ED physician decide administer intravenous opioid pain control : 1 . What incidence serious adverse event , define use naloxone , total 2 hour infusion 2 mg IV hydromorphone ? 2 . What incidence side effect ( respiratory depression , hypotension , oxygen desaturation , nausea , vomit , pruritus ) 5 , 15 , 30 120 minute post infusion 2mg IV hydromorphone ? 3 . What speed onset 2 mg IV hydromorphone ? This measure ask patient NRS pain score 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 minute post infusion 2 mg IV hydromorphone . 4 . What incidence administration rescue medication ? 5 . For patient decline enter study , reason refusal ( e.g . fear become addict ) ? The investigator believe yet another barrier provide adequate pain relief patient acute severe pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fixed Dose Intravenous Hydromorphone Treatment Acute Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Background : Pain cite frequent reason visit emergency department ( EDs ) ( McCaig , 2001 ) . It estimate National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , annual survey representative sample visit US EDs , 17 million visit per year US EDs specific complaint pain , 29 million visit include `` back symptom '' `` injury otherwise specify '' well specific mention pain . However widely acknowledge pain seriously under-treated ED well health care setting ( Ducharme , 1996 ; Selbst , 1990 ; Wilson , 1989 ) . The concern regard under-treatment reflected new standard pain management develop Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) require assessment pain triage ED refer pain measurement `` fifth vital sign '' ( Philips , 2000 ) . Proper pain management tremendous challenge ED physicians pain noxious experience also symptom injury disease need understood appropriately treat . Further complicate pain management large interpersonal variability pain perception expression reflect cultural , contextual , individual difference people . Reasons under-treating pain include concern side effect opioids , perception pain complaint possible drug-seeking behavior , under-staffing , concern analgesic mask symptom delay early diagnosis treatment , contribute risk tolerance dependence vulnerable patient . Morphine long consider gold standard pain control . Hydromorphone another powerful opioid use extensively management post-operative pain morphine-resistant cancer-related pain . A recent Cochrane review use hydromorphone find 32 study focus acute pain ( Quigley , 2003 ) . Of 32 study , 9 involve intravenous form hydromorphone ( Coda , 1997 ; Collins , 1996 ; Deutsch , 1968 ; Jasani , 1994 ; Liu , 1995 ; Mahler , 1975 ; Rapp , 1996 ; Searle , 1994 ; Urquhart , 1988 ) . Of 8 study , 5 involve patient control analgesia , 1 study compare IV hydromorphone IV morphine ( Mahler , 1975 ) . The Cochrane review conclude substantial gap understand efficacy potency hydromorphone . We recently complete study non-elderly adult patient ( IRB 04-08-225 ) show weight-based IV hydromorphone provide well pain relief weight-based IV morphine . This result statistically clinically significant . We also demonstrate study IV hydromorphone faster onset also provide statistically significant improvement pain relief 5 minute compare IV morphine . Although weight-based dosing medication common pediatrics , emergency physician use whole integer amount pain medication . IV hydromorphone potent IV morphine , dosages give much small . We therefore wish give standard 2 mg dose IV hydromorphone non-elderly adult patient weigh least 150 lbs present ED acute severe pain . We wish examine safety speed onset hydromorphone use protocol . Our general think develop evidence base practice , need generate practice base evidence . This study attempt practice base practical . We wish take drug come ( 2mg Dilaudid ampule ) use , thus alleviate need waste excess opioid ( alleviate need find second person witness waste ) . We also wish use weight cutoff everyone remember ( 150 lb ) . We believe protocol provide great pain relief help address issue inadequate pain treatment , `` oligoanalgesia '' , prominent literature ( Sobel 2002 , Wilson , 1989 , Goldfrank 2000 ) . Finally , multiple study pain conducted ED , find relatively high rate refusal receive pain medication . We think may represent component problem oligoanalgesia widespread ED . We wish investigate reason patient refusal receive parental opioid medication ( fear addiction , side effect , etc ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age great 21 year : Patients age 21 automatically triaged Children 's Hospital Montefiore Emergency Department , hence enrol study . 2 . Age le 65 year age : Patients age 65 exclude study effect opioids elderly may different nonelderly . 3 . Pain onset within 7 day : Pain within seven day definition acute pain use ED literature . 4 . ED attend physician 's judgment patient 's pain warrant use morphine : The factor influence decision use parenteral opioids complex extensive . An approach commonly take address issue patient selection drug trial use specific condition ( e.g. , renal colic ) treatment ( e.g. , posthysterectomy ) would generally think appropriately treat opioid analgesic , thereby eliminate individual judgment eligibility study . However order assess role hydromorphone wide generalizability ED setting , decide enroll patient variety diagnosis , complaint acute pain . Opioids appropriate treatment patient present complaint pain ( e.g. , gastroenteritis , migraine ) . Therefore , unless restriction patient specific diagnosis , either comprehensive list diagnosis situation opioids indicate must specify , clinical judgment need use . We opt latter alternative . The use patient variety diagnosis , therefore heterogeneous painful stimulus , risk mask treatment effect large interindividual variability . There several design analytic factor ( detail ) attenuate risk : 1 ) sufficiently large number patient randomly assign group variety painful stimulus equally distribute treatment group ; 2 ) change pain intensity pain relief analyze rather absolute pain intensity pain relief therefore reduce variability . 5 . Normal mental status : In order provide measure pain experienced patient need normal mental status . Orientation person , place time use indicator sufficiently normal mental status participate study . 1 . Prior use methadone : effect methadone use perception acute pain unknown suspect altered . We feel needs patient methadone may exceed dosage ceiling 2mg use study . Similar sickle cell patient chronic cancer patient , patient methadone usually require significantly high dos opioids control pain . Thus , feel would unethical restrict dose subset patient receive . 2 . Use opioids tramadol within past seven day : avoid introduce bias relate opioid tolerance may alter response study medication thereby mask medication 's effect . 3 . Prior adverse reaction hydromorphone . 4 . Chronic pain syndrome : frequently recurrent daily pain least 3 month result alteration pain perception think due downregulation pain receptor . Examples chronic pain syndrome include sickle cell anemia , osteoarthritis , fibromyalgia , migraine , peripheral neuropathy . 5 . Alcohol intoxication : presence alcohol intoxication judge treat physician may alter perception , report , treatment pain . 6 . SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg : Hydromorphone produce peripheral vasodilation may result orthostatic hypotension syncope . 7 . Use MAO inhibitor past 30 day : MAOs report intensify effect least one opioid drug cause anxiety , confusion significant respiratory depression coma . 8 . C02 measurement great 46 : In accordance similar study ( 0412360 ) , three subset patient CO2 measure use handheld capnometer prior enrollment study . If CO2 measurement great 46 , patient exclude study . The 3 subset follow : 1 . All patient history COPD 2 . All patient report history asthma together great 20 packyear smoke history 3 . All patient report less 20 packyear smoke history asthma exacerbation</criteria>
