	<brief_summary>In study want compare effectiveness bone substitute ( Allogenix Plus , product derive dead human chosen donate prior die ) bone dust patient 's bone piece , versus bone dust alone fill gap sometimes occur surgery craniosynostosis . We compare percent defect fill 1 year 5 patient 18 month old metopic craniosynostosis receive bone substitute plus bone dust 5 previously operate patient similar characteristic receive bone dust alone fill gap . The bone substitute use provide cost company Biomet Microfixation . The bone substitute Allogenix Plus undergoes extensive screen infectious disease well process prevent rejection . The product apply standard surgery 5 patient metopic craniosynostosis 18 month old skull defect large 25 cm2 , require additional surgery . Aside placement bone substitute patient proceed receive standard care include pre-operative CT scan , immediate post-operative CT scan , 1 year post-operative CT scan Head . We review scan look percent bony growth bone substitute plus bone dust group . We also see patient clinic , standard care follow-up visit 1 week , 3 week , 6 week , 12 week , 6 month , 1 year post-operatively . During clinic visit monitor patient closely potential side effect bone substitute well complication surgery . We review chart 5 patient 18 month old undergone surgery metopic craniosynostosis 5 patient similar characteristic defect size obtain . We compare post-operative CT scan picture look bone growth , bone resorption , bone gap present , need secondary surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The skull make multiple bone separate time birth suture ( joint ) . These suture ( open space ) allow growth brain result growth skull bone . These suture close different stage life , metopic suture early one close 2 year old late 26 year old . If suture ( open space ) close prematurely patient develop craniosynostosis . This result lack growth skull perpendicular suture line increase growth parallel suture . There different degree craniosynostosis result anything slight ridge along suture line abnormal head shape cause constriction brain , developmental delay , elevate intracranial pressure . Patients significant abnormal head shape patient show developmental delay undergo surgical intervention . The surgery call Cranial Vault Remodeling consist open scalp access skull bone involve , remove bone underlie brain , reshape expand bone , place back protect brain . The skull bone hold together absorbable plate . Because skull bone expand allow adequate brain growth gap leave without bone . Some gap fill leave small bony piece . Other gap fill even small piece leave bone place saw mill form bone dust . Often , amount bone dust bone piece enough fill gap . When gap leave unfilled usually take long area fill patient 's bone . This mean brain underneath gap leave unprotected cover bone . At time , primarily child 18 month old , find gaps never fully fill require child undergo second surgery bone take either ribs skull fill gap . Specific Aims : 1 ) Evaluate efficacy bone substitute Allogenix Plus ossification small cranial defect patient metopic craniosynostosis form exist . These derive cadaver graft material determine eligible transplantation qualify tissue bank medical director communicable disease test perform laboratory certified CLIA . Allogenix Plus demineralize bone matrix obtain use cortical cancellous allograft bone treat remove surface lipid dehydrate ethanol ethyl esther . The bone process hyaluronic acid remove acid-soluble protein bone , leave behind protein , bone growth factor , collagen . The demineralized bone matrix combine lecithin non-toxic lipid carrier derive soybean resistant breakdown body fluid . It also contain additional synthetic material know Pro Osteon Implant 500R . This naturally derive material make non-decorative form coral , subject patent thermal process , convert coral hydroxyapatite . Following conversion material longer coral composite highly resorbable calcium carbonate slow resorb out layer calcium phosphate . The material retain porous , interconnected architecture coral give similar structure cancellous bone , provide pathway bony ingrowth . Allogenix Plus osteoinductive , serve scaffold provide framework necessary bone growth , osteoconductive , able induce bone formation place site bone may normally grow . It approve use fill craniofacial defect craniotomy large 25 cm2 . Material Methods : In study recruit 5 subject 18 month old metopic craniosynostosis receive Allogenix Plus bone dust fill small calvarial gap compare historical cohort receive bone dust . The parent new patient see clinic ask participate voluntary basis 5 subject 18 month old metopic craniosynostosis undergo fronto-orbital advancement cranial vault remodel recruit . They advise risk benefit study . Once informed consent obtain patient 's undergo surgery . During surgery calvarial defect less 25 cm2 measure fill quantified amount bone dust quantify amount Allogenix Plus . Pictures take different stage procedure currently standard care . Once do surgery patient obtain Head CT scan immediate post-operative period , current standard care . The patient receive standard post-operative care . During clinic visit 1 week , 3 week , 6 week , 12 week , 6 month , 1 year evaluate potential complication include infection , rejection transplant material , wind breakdown . One year surgery patient undergo another CT Head . In CT scan evaluate bone formation , bone resorption , bony gap present . We obtain historical cohort comprise 5 patient age sex match 5 subject receive Allogenix Plus perform chart review . We compare picture , immediate post-operative CT scan Head , 1 year post-operative CT scan Head defect size percent ossification defect bone dust alone , current standard care , versus bone dust Allogenix Plus .</detailed_description>
