	<brief_summary>Stroke major cause disability worldwide . Stroke survivor commonly exhibit walk defect lead alter , slow speed asymmetric gait pattern . The main aim rehabilitation enhance recovery movement control regain walk ability . Ankle-foot orthoses ( AFOs ) , brace encompass foot ankle joint extend point knee , commonly prescribe address ambulation impairment stroke patient . Their main function support foot allow subject walk safely gait approach normality . This project aim evaluate early provision AFOs adjunct standard physiotherapy walk ability stroke survivor . Usual rehabilitation practice control condition . Participants recruit stroke unit Stobhill Hospital Glasgow . They randomise two group . Participants allocate control group receive usual clinical practice per routine stroke patient . The intervention group receive custom make solid AFOs adjunct . They provide three AFOs , one use rehabilitation two use outcome assessment session research purpose . The intervention phase last 24 week . Gait analysis perform three time participant ( baseline , 12 24 week enrolment ) biomechanical laboratory Strathclyde University . During session force movement data patient walk record . Fortnightly time distance factor gait measure battery functional task perform physiotherapy gym hospital use simple video camera grid lino-mat . During assessment participant AFO ask walk without AFO provide .</brief_summary>
