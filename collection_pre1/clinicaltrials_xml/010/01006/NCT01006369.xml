	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Hydroxychloroquine may help chemotherapy bevacizumab work well kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give hydroxychloroquine together capecitabine , oxaliplatin , bevacizumab work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic colorectal carcinoma treat hydroxychloroquine combination capecitabine , oxaliplatin , bevacizumab compare previously report median PFS 7.9 month . Secondary - To measure overall response rate . - To measure duration response respond patient . - To measure disease-control rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease least 2 course ) . - To document safety feasibility regimen patient . - To develop surrogate biomarkers autophagy detection patient tissue specimens characterize effect hydroxychloroquine autophagy patient vivo . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Peripheral blood tumor tissue sample may collect biomarker laboratory study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
