	<brief_summary>Wet age-related macular degeneration common cause blind registration UK . Standard treatment involve regular eye injection drug call ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) . For patient , ranibizumab maintains vision effect drug temporary , therefore require monthly hospital visit typically six injection eye every year , probably life . This study test new surgical device delivers focal dose radiation ( epimacular brachytherapy ) macula ( part inside back eye give fine central vision ) , try reduce eliminate need ongoing , regular eye injection . The trial compare epimacular brachytherapy ongoing standard treatment ranibizumab . Whereas study new surgical device target patient yet commence treatment , study target require frequent eye injection , limited surgical resource resource best direct fully respond ranibizumab therapy , whose response shortlived . These patient gain device may reduce burden treatment . The finding untreated disease extrapolate discrete subset patient , hence need study target refractory disease . It hypothesise epimacular brachytherapy reduce frequency Lucentis® ( ranibizumab ) re-treatment patient require , whilst maintain visual acuity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The eye design like camera , lens front film back . Using analogy , retina film camera . In center retina macula , region absorbs focus light lens create image outside world transmit brain . The common cause irreversible blindness develop nation age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) . There two type , 'dry ' 'wet ' AMD . Wet AMD also call neovascular AMD : It damage type blind people matter week . Neovascular AMD due growth blood vessel retina , similar wound healing process . The blood vessel grow two pattern , classic ( 15 % ) occult ( 85 % ) ; visualize fluorescein angiography , commonly use technique photograph macula fluorescent dye inject arm . In research AMD , vision assess use Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) vision chart , result quantify number letter read correctly , 0 ( poor vision ) 100 ( good vision ) . A new treatment recently license UK call ranibizumab ( trade name , Lucentis ) . This antibody reduce effect vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , chemical mediates new blood vessel growth . This drug inject eye regular interval ( 12 year , typically 6 year ) . Patients receive 12 ranibizumab injection per year great 90 % chance maintain vision 12 month ( 1-2 ) . Another drug call bevacizumab ( Avastin ) use label ( without licence ) UK , USA country , also target VEGF . In non−randomized trial show similar result ranibizumab , currently assess head−to−head trial ranibizumab UK USA . One drawbacks ranibizumab therapy patient require regular injection eye . In UK , NICE recommend patient newly diagnose wet AMD receive three consecutive monthly injection ranibizumab , follow 'as require ' therapy base disease activity . They estimate patient receive eight injection first year , six second , ongoing treatment thereafter . Patients require monthly hospital visit life injection caries small cumulative risk complication bleed inside eye , infection , detachment retina , raise eye pressure , systemic effect stroke . A treatment produce durable reduction disease activity might reduce risk , cost effective health service , reduce considerable burden treatment patient carers , prospect few hospital visit . It would also give patient alternative choice , wish undergo regular eye injection . Radiation potential produce durable therapeutic effect , target proliferate cell cause visual damage wet AMD . It well know radiation modify wound heal process , biological process similar neovascular AMD . Previous study external beam radiation show effect progression macular degeneration . However vision improve - possibly due type radiation use , accuracy delivery , collateral damage neighbour structure . Epimacular brachytherapy delivers local , control radiation 1−3 mm macula , operation call vitrectomy . The proposed device CE mark ( approved clinical use ) manufacture NeoVista , complete preliminary trial assess safety feasibility treat naive ( newly diagnose ) neovascular AMD single application brachytherapy . Initial data show epiretinal treatment stabilise vision patient neovascular AMD . Phase II trial use device two concomitant dos bevacizumab show promising result 91 % patient maintain vision ( lose few 15 ETDRS letter ) , average improvement 8.9 ETDRS letter ( 3 ) . The percentage patient whose visual acuity improve 3 line ( 15 letter ETDRS scale ) 38 % . These result similar large study monthly ranibizumab . A mean gain 8.9 letter twice visual gain report large study ( HORIZON ) 'as require ' dosing , occur UK . A large , international , randomize , multicentre study device , use two concomitant injection ranibizumab , underway ( CABERNET study ) . Recruitment occur hospital applicant , two UK site , site follow . The CABERNET study use device treatment naive disease favourably review Southwest Research Ethics Committee ( 07/H0206/50 ) . Whilst CABERNET study provide high quality data treatment naive disease , possible rely study relation previously treat disease . Prior therapy ranibizumab modifies disease process , respond poorly injection differ majority , suggest difference underlie disease process . It therefore necessary study subset patient refractory disease , valid clinical conclusion reach . Furthermore , limit vitreoretinal surgical capacity logical offer surgical intervention patient respond fully ranibizumab , rather aim treat patient present wet-AMD . To end , uncontrolled study ( MERITAGE ) use device refractory , previously treat disease commence , receive favourable opinion Southwest Research Ethics Committee ( 07/H0206/55 ) . The present randomise control trial ( MERLOT ) follow Phase II MERITAGE study . It target previously treat disease , patient receive regular ranibizumab , determine device benefit large subset patient .</detailed_description>
