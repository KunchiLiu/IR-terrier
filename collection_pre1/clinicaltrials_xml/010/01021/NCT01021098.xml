	<brief_summary>Recently , emergence rapid global dissemination novel swine-origin influenza A virus ( H1N1 ) unique epidemiologic characteristic heighten awareness concern viral pathogen , potential major disruption civil military stability . Although advance medical scientific technology improve basic understanding respiratory disease , many question epidemiology immunology ARI remain unanswered . This study plan initiate multi-site , multi-disciplinary research collaboration , term Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium ( ARIC ) purpose study etiology , epidemiology immunology influenza-like illness ( ILI ) order describe natural history risk factor disease , well characteristic host immune response . At core ARIC propose observational , longitudinal study Natural History Study ILI among active duty military member , healthy retiree , dependent recruit inpatient outpatient setting military treatment facility ( MTF ) continental US follow total four ( 4 ) visit 28-day period . Additionally , investigator also propose conduct household-based study influenza ( Family Transmission Study ) individual laboratory-confirmed influenza illness recruit enrol along family member purpose study transmission influenza within household . Taken together , study establish longitudinal cohort ILI among active duty member family , well repository biological specimen relevant epidemiology immunology infection . Ultimately , study serve solid foundation future investigation ARI epidemiology , treatment prevention base .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational , longitudinal study ARI/ILI among otherwise healthy active duty military member , retiree , well spouse dependent . An additional cohort HIV-infected adult also evaluate . We collect data clinical finding , medical chart review , diagnostic , virologic , immunologic assay describe epidemiology immunology ARI/ILI . Subject recruitment take place inpatient outpatient setting military treatment facility ( MTF ) continental US . Additionally , subject self-referral encourage institutional review board ( IRB ) approve advertisement . Both adult 65 year age child eligible participation . Subjects follow total 4 visit 28±7-day period . After final visit ( Day 28±7 applicable window ) , participant may re-enroll study 3 month pass . Nasal swab , blood specimen ( consent ) , buccal cytobrush sample ( consent ) , rectal swab ( select subgroup consent inpatient ) collect order characterize etiologic , epidemiologic , immunologic characteristic ARI study population . In HIV- positive cohort , additional clinical data blood collect HIV-specific factor ( e.g. , CD4 count , HIV RNA level ) additional immunologic study day 0 28 ( ± 7 ) study . This prospective longitudinal study use data clinical finding , medical chart review , diagnostic , virologic immunologic laboratory describe epidemiology immunology ARI/ILI .</detailed_description>
