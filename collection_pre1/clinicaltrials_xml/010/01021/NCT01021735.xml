	<detailed_description>Anti-TNF therapy become establish part treatment patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) fail ( maintain ) adequate response conventional disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) accord BSR Biologics guideline approve NICE 1,2 Other biologic drug , rituximab , approve use NHS patient fail anti-TNF therapy.3 Rituximab also effective patient fail conventional DMARDs yet expose anti-TNF therapy.4 It possible rituximab less effective anti-TNF therapy biologic naïve patient head head trial carry . Rheumatologists face question - biologic use first ? All biologics expensive , relative cost effectiveness available therapy need consider . NICE Scottish Medicines Consortium ( SMC ) charge provide guidance NHS use biologic drug , recognise great deal uncertainty associate health economic modelling basis NICE/SMC decision . Currently , randomise control trial show anti-TNF rituximab therapy effective . Whilst overall response rate appear similar , important difference trial population make comparison trial limit usefulness , data compatible important clinical difference efficacy . The financial risk NHS expose considerable : cost anti-TNF therapy approximately £9-10,000 per annum ; rituximab cost ~£3,500 per treatment course , need repeat ( average ) every 6-9 month give annual cost £4700 - 7000 . In Scotland , ~450 biologic-naive RA patient start anti-TNF drug 2007 ( personal communication ) translate ~4-5000 patient start anti-TNF therapy year UK , annual cost ~£40million . Were rituximab prove effective biologic-naive patient anti-TNF therapy could result saving NHS £9 - 20 million per annum , depend frequency re-treatment rituximab require . On hand , anti-TNF therapy effective rituximab therapy , would important good evidence inform NICE/SMC appraisal might otherwise conclude current literature rituximab affords cost-effective approach . The propose trial randomise control trial compare efficacy cost-effectiveness two treatment strategy patient require biologic treatment accord BSR guideline : start anti-TNF therapy first , compare use rituximab first . Treatment switch alternative technology event toxicity , lack loss response . Treatment dos schedule accord current licensed dos medication ; rituximab use accordance recent trial biologic-naïve patient expect form basis Roche 's application license extension ( personal communication ) .5,6 A pragmatic approach anti-TNF therapy take : variation choice anti-TNF drug ( etanercept , infliximab adalimumab ) consensus ( evidence ) one superior another . This fact recognise NICE recommends use anti-TNF therapy identify anti-TNF drug choice . In UK , vast majority patient treat one two sub-cutaneous preparation ( etanercept adalimumab ) rather infliximab logistical reason . Hence , patient enrol trial randomise anti-TNF therapy treat either adalimumab etanercept , follow discussion advice rheumatologist . There evidence patient sero-negative rheumatoid factor anti-CCP antibody less likely respond rituximab therapy,7 consensus patient treat anti-TNF therapy eligible trial . Safety remain important concern patient clinicians adverse event carefully record , although trial size power exclude clinically relevant difference treatment rate serious adverse event . The side effect profile anti-TNF rituximab therapy differ , treatment modality associate increase risk infection . In contrast adverse effect associate specifically anti-TNF ( e.g . demyelination ) rituximab ( e.g . Progressive Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy ) therapy . The safety add anti-TNF therapy patient remain B-cell deplete important . The evidence date suggest significant increase risk serious infective complication patients,8 comparison rate adverse event patient switch rituximab anti-TNF therapy compare rate see switch form anti-TNF rituximab . In addition , co-existing depression common patient severe RA show significantly reduce patient ' response , increase side effect , anti-TNF therapy . It know whether similar effect occur Rituximab . If effect pre-existing depression response differs anti-TNF rituximab therapy , could major impact biologic choice depress patient routine clinical care . It known proportion patient achieve remission low disease activity state ( LDAS ) biologic therapy . Partial non-response entail significant cost , encompass economic burden NHS exposure potential adverse event patient . Predicting patient clinical response likely occur would aid decision making clinician , reduce unnecessary adverse effect patient confer considerable health utility benefit . Patients agree participate ORBIT ask consider whether , addition , would consent undergo synovial biopsy part pilot study test hypothesis synovial tissue RA patient carry molecular and/or cellular signature ( 'pathotype ' ) capture optimise rational choice biologic agent thereby enhance proportion patient achieve high-hurdle endpoint . Ultrasound-guided biopsy safe , well-tolerated technique render synovium accessible high proportion patient . Following treatment variety immune-modulatory agent , certain molecular cellular feature within synovial biopsy ( e.g . SL-CD68 expression ) predict subsequent clinical improvement . However , clinical trial experience indicate heterogeneity response target discrete cellular molecular component inflammation biologic therapy present , determine optimum biologic therapy give individual largely matter trial error . Therefore aim investigate whether pathologic feature within synovial membrane ( propose call 'synovial pathotype ' ) could use direct choice biologic agent priori sub-group patient enrol trial ask undergo synovial biopsy . Specifically , address question : use rituximab patient synovial biopsy contain feature commensurate ectopic germinal formation , TNF blocker patient diffuse inflammation , improve response rate ? If successful , study provide novel biopsy-led rationale choice biologic agent . In addition , sample serum , RNA genomic DNA patient enrol ORBIT contribute MRC-funded PEAC ( Pathobiology Early Arthritis Cohort ) biobank . They provide resource future analysis separate relevant application .</detailed_description>
