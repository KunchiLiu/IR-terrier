	<brief_summary>Not infrequently , physician face uncertainty regard ability patient perform adequate exercise noninvasive evaluation know suspected coronary artery disease ( CAD ) use radionuclide stress myocardial perfusion image . In selected patient , protocol combine exercise ( either low-level symptom-limited ) vasodilator stress agent find safe effective identification presence severity CAD well risk stratification adverse cardiac outcome . However , currently utilize combine stress protocol drawback . Further refinement combine stress protocol would potentially lead appropriate stress protocol selection patient enhance laboratory efficiency . The purpose prospective , randomize study evaluate relative merit combine regadenoson symptom-limited exercise patient clinically-referred vasodilator-exercise stress myocardial perfusion image assessment know suspected CAD . It hypothesize combine regadenoson symptom-limited exercise safe feasible stress test modality non-inferior combine symptom-limited exercise dipyridamole .</brief_summary>
