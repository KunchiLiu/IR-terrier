	<brief_summary>The investigator randomize control trial compare bovine carotid artery graft ePTFE graft patient need hemodialysis access . The goal study determine difference primary assisted patency rate frequency complication two type graft . The investigator ' hypothesis bovine carotid artery graft closely mimic autologous tissue therefore , would provide good patency few complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To understand bovine carotid artery ( BCA ) graft compare cuff polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE ) graft conduits hemodialysis access term patency complication . Background : Many hemodialysis patient adequate anatomy native arteriovenous fistula . In patient , synthetic conduit remain option permanent hemodialysis access . We seek compare standard cuffed ePTFE bovine carotid artery graft undertake since 1970 's . Methods : Following Institutional Review Board approval , prospective , randomize control trial conduct enrol 29 patient BCA group 28 patient ePTFE group . Univariate multivariate analysis undertaken understand factor affect complication . Patency rate calculate use Kaplan-Meyer method .</detailed_description>
