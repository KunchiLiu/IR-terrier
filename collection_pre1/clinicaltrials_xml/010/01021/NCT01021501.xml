	<brief_summary>This prospective , open , non-randomized , non-controlled study . 20 patient hypertension chronic maintenance hemodialysis enrol study . All patient mild moderate hypertension receive antihypertensive agent . This study design investigate effect Adalat GITS hemodialytic blood pressure patient chronic hemodialysis use ABPM measure drug plasma concentration . For purpose investigate influence hemodialysis drug plasma concentration well efficacy , necessary assign subject Adalat monotherapy . Since patient hemodialysis center need already receive combination therapy , would practical start Adalat 60mg/day monotherapy remain similar antihypertensive effect discontinue previous treatment study population screen enrol . And take consideration clinical practice , patient undergoing hemodialysis could well control low dose Adalat 30mg/day alone . So study evaluate effect safety Adalat GITS 60mg/day alone thereafter influence hemodialysis drug plasma concentration without possible drug interaction . The agent give orally day 08:00h patient follow least 4 week . After , patient whose blood pressure well control Adalat GITS 60mg/day office blood pressure would enrol ABPM assessment plasma concentration evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Calcium channel blocker widely use reduce blood pressure hypertensive patient hemodialysis . They useful I patient leave ventricular hypertrophy , diastolic dysfunction stable angina pectoris . Adalat GITS , long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , use one first choices treat hypertension effective hypotensive potency relative absence side effect compare short-acting agent . Antihypertensive effect calcium channel blocker largely depend plasma concentration , rapid increase blood pressure may occur circulate level blocker decrease hemodialysis . This rapid fluctuation blood pressure may evoke rapid alteration hemodynamics . Luik et al . show pre- post-dialysis blood pressure measurement patient hemodialysis may mislead determine blood pressure . Ambulatory pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) may useful estimate blood pressure control dialyse patient . For patient dialysis , goal office blood pressure less average value 150/90 mmHg medication . The reasonable target goal mean ambulatory blood pressure le 135/85 mmHg day le 120/80 mmHg night . There need convince data demonstrate effect Adalat GITS hemodialytic patient use ABPM investigate plasma concentration . This study design investigate effect Adalat GITS hemodialytic blood pressure patient chronic hemodialysis use ABPM measure drug plasma concentration . This prospective , open , non-randomized , non-controlled study . 20 patient hypertension chronic maintenance hemodialysis enrol study . All patient mild moderate hypertension receive antihypertensive agent . All antihypertensive agent receive patient screened withdrawn patient assign receive nifedipine control release tablets 60mg/day . The agent give orally day 08:00h patient follow least 4 week . After 4 week antihypertensive treatment , 20 patient adequate blood pressure achieve ( pre-hemodialysis office blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg ) recruit study . If adequate blood pressure achieve , patient exclude . After patient achieve adequate blood pressure ( pre-hemodialysis office blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg ) enrollment , 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) immediately perform day hemodialysis within subsequent two day . The administration Adalat continue previously morning hemodialytic day AMPM blood sampling study . The blood sample , 1 hour , 2 hour 3 hour start hemodialysis , immediately hemodialysis measure circulate level nifedipine correspond time point next hemodialysis-free day . The 24-hour ABPM perform enrolled patient day hemodialysis . The monitoring start 08:00 h drug give . The device program measure blood pressure every 30 min ( 08:00 h 21:00 h ) every 60 min ( 21:00 h 08:00 h ) .</detailed_description>
