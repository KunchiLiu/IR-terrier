	<brief_title>Zileuton With Without Celecoxib As Chemopreventive Agents Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether short-term administration zileuton , 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) inhibitor , current smoker suppress formation urinary leukotriene E4 ( LTE4 ) shunt arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase ( COX ) pathway , result elevate urinary prostaglandin E-metabolite ( PGE-M ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether short-term co-administration celecoxib , selective COX-2 inhibitor , zileuton suppresses level urinary LTE4 PGE-M current smoker . II . To evaluate association baseline level urinary LTE4 magnitude arachidonic acid shunt induce zileuton . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive zileuton orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-6 . ARM II : Patients receive zileuton Arm I celecoxib PO BID day 1-6 .</detailed_description>
