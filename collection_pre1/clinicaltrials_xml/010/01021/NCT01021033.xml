	<brief_summary>Background : - Stroke , also know acute cerebrovascular attack , lead cause long-term disability worldwide . Stroke survivor often leave permanent physical mental disability . - Many stroke patient receive different therapy attempt improve independence quality life . However , current strategy focus acute stage stroke limited influence improve stroke outcome . One main problem patient suffer stroke difficulty use hand opposite side affect hemisphere brain ; date , researcher successful mean improve hand function chronic stage stroke . - Researchers interested develop pool individual research hand motor function stroke . Objectives : - To perform screen evaluation patient refer stroke determine eligibility current future protocol study effect stroke nervous system motor function . Eligibility : - Individuals experience single stroke one side brain occur least 3 month prior participation screen study . Individuals must residual hand motor function . Design : - Participants study recruit patient referral . - Eligible participant undergo 4- 5-hour screen medical history , physical neurological examination , stroke evaluation , anatomical magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . The screen visit may do course one day , need patient convenience test availability . - In addition initial outpatient visit , subject may remain enrolled study 15 year may contact see qualify new branch study . Subjects may re-examine per year remain protocol confirm ongoing eligibility . The re-examination visit involve neurologic evaluation possible repeat MRI . - No clinical care provide protocol..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose protocol perform screen evaluation patient refer stroke determine eligibility current future protocol aim understanding mechanism underlie plastic change human central nervous system , non-invasive stimulation motor cortex could improve motor function patient chronic stroke . Study population : Twelve hundred adult patient monohemispheric single stroke , occur least 3 month prior participation screen study , residual hand motor function enrol . Design : This screening protocol determine eligibility branch protocol . Outcome measure : The outcome measure number subject subsequently enroll HCPS study .</detailed_description>
