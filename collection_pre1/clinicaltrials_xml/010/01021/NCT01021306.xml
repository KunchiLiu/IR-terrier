	<detailed_description>All patient offer self-care checklist homecare approach baseline . Patients treat two month follow 3 6 month enrollment . The primary outcome measure 11 point Numerical Rating Scale average TMD pain past week . Secondary outcome include Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14 ) , believability sham AMCT compare active AMCT , expectation satisfaction care , medication use , bothersomeness symptom health care utilization . Our project collaborative effort Palmer Center Chiropractic Research ( PCCR ) University Iowa ( UI ) College Dentistry General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Oral Craniofacial Unit . The PCCR Clinic Data Core serve data coordinate center develop web-based data collection system project . Patient eligibility assess dental examiner UI College Dentistry use Research Diagnostic Criteria Temporomandibular Disorders diagnose chronic , Axis I myofascial TMD . Dental care provide dentist UI GCRC chiropractic care provide private practitioner close proximity UI . The aim project assess feasibility conduct full-scale randomized clinical trial evaluate effectiveness AMCT patient chronic myofascial TMD ; determine appropriate control group ( ) full-scale randomize controlled trial ; estimate sample size need adequately-powered trial recruitment period would require . In general , lack evidence efficacy non-surgical treatment patient TMD , include chiropractic intervention . If beneficial effect AMCT support pilot study , logistical information gain allow u plan full scale trial patient suffer pain disability due TMD . It anticipate trial allow clinician make informed recommendation treatment patient TMD . At conclusion project , well-positioned prepare R01 level grant application .</detailed_description>
