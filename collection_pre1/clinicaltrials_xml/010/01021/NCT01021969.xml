	<brief_summary>The increase intake fructose associate increase obesity among US child adolescent , `` dose dependent '' effect insulin sensitivity lipid metabolism study detail . Methods : 36 healthy male adult human subject include study . They randomly allocate low , moderate high fructose , moderate high glucose sucrose diet 3 week . In randomized order 4 week wash interval subject receive six different diet . Three day food record use measure total fructose glucose intake . During low fructose diet subject instruct avoid nutrient contain fructose aim consumption le 1g fructose/d . During moderate fructose diet subject receive 3x13.3g fructose glucose , respectively . High fructose diet subject receive either 3x26.7g/d fructose , 3x 26.7g/d glucose 3x 26.7g/d sucrose form three daily soft drink take together three main meal . 75 g oral glucose tolerance test perform composite insulin sensitivity index calculate The presence phosphorylated fructose metabolite plasma measure targeted LC-MS/MS . In addition , metabolite biomarkers plasma screen untargeted metabolite profile use LC-MS GC-MS . In subgroup 10 subject euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp perform use [ 6,6- 2H2 ] glucose . Thus , lipogenic potential fructose human compare isocaloric amount glucose . Particularly , question whether lipogenic effect continuously dose dependent whether lipogenic shunt yes , level ingest fructose address .</brief_summary>
