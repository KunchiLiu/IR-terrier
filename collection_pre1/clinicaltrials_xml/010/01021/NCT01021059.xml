	<detailed_description>Background : - Interleukin-15 ( IL-15 ) powerful immunostimulatory cytokine broad range biological activity . - In contrast IL-2 , IL-15 inhibit activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) T-cells involved maintenance CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell act inhibitory checkpoint immune response . - IL-15 involved proliferation , differentiation activation CD8+ T-cells NK-cells , maintenance long term CD8+ memory T-cells . - In preclinical study , vaccinia-based vaccine express IL-15 induced long lasting , high-avidity cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) mediate immunity , whereas immunity mediate IL-2 express vaccine short-lived . Furthermore , IL-15 overcome lack CD4 help CTL induction . - IL-15 highly active number syngeneic mouse tumor model also effective augment activity NK-cells CD8+ T-cells rhesus macaque indicate may active human cancer . Objectives : - The primary objective trial determine safety , toxicity profile , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) intravenous recombinant human IL-15 ( rhIL-15 ) administer daily intravenous bolus infusion 12 consecutive day subject metastatic malignant melanoma renal cell cancer . - Secondary objective include determination rhIL-15 pharmacokinetics , particular time course decline rhIL-15 serum follow intravenous administration definition immunogenicity rhIL-15 subject receive drug . - To characterize biological effect rhIL-15 proportion absolute number circulate NK-cells , CD45RO+CD8+ T-cells central effector memory subset base expression CD28 , CD95 , CCR7 CD62L flow cytometry determine effect plasma level pro-inflammatory cytokine . - Obtain preliminary information antitumor effect repeat cycle rhIL-15 patient metastatic malignant melanoma renal cell cancer . Eligibility Criteria : - Patients great equal 18 years-old pathologically confirm metastatic malignant melanoma metastatic renal cell cancer . - Patients metastatic renal cell cancer must either refuse treatment , fail tolerate , progressive disease receive sorafenib sunitinib , temsirolimus . - Patients measurable disease . - Absolute granulocyte count ( AGC ) least 1500/mm ( 3 ) platelet count least 75,000/mm ( 3 ) . Design : - This single institution , open-label , non-randomized 3 + 3 design phase I dose-escalation study determine safety , toxicity MTD rhIL-15 patient metastatic malignant melanoma renal cell cancer . - Groups 3 6 patient receive rhIL-15 dos 0.3 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 15 , 20 25 mcg/kg/day 12 day provide DLT observe . - Correlative protocol study obtain prior treatment specific time point treatment include pharmacokinetics clearance rhIL-15 serum , immunogenicity test development neutralize anti-rhIL-15 antibody immunological study endpoint evaluation effect rhIL-15 immune cell subset population pro-inflammatory cytokine level peripheral blood .</detailed_description>
