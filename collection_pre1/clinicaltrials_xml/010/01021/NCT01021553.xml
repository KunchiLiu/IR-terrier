	<brief_summary>To determine demand dose 50 mg 150 mg GSK557296 demonstrate superior efficacy respect duration intra vaginal ejaculatory latency time ( IELT ) 8 week study period compare placebo men primary premature ejaculation . An assessment safety tolerability dose GSK557296 perform well assessment change Index Premature Ejaculation ( IPE ) baseline end 8 week treatment . During active treatment period study participant limit maximum 40 dos GSK557296 , placebo , spill 20 dos 4 week interval .</brief_summary>
