	<brief_title>Respiratory Tract Inflammation Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease , Crohn 's disease ( CD ) Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory disease remission exacerbation . CD UC associate variety systemic ( extra-intestinal ) manifestation . In study , clinical subclinical pulmonary abnormality describe active IBD well stable situation . Nitric oxide ( NO ) important mediator inflammation several pathological conditions.Patients lung disease , like asthma , high level Fraction exhale Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) active disease comparison healthy volunteer . One study adult IBD patient show increase FeNO level patient , positive correlation disease activity negative correlation disease activity pulmonary function . We hypothesise respiratory tract inflammation express FeNO spirometry pediatric IBD patient correlate activity primary disease . Methods : FeNO level spirometry assess 40 patient CD UC ( age 4-18 year ) remission exacerbation , calculate Pediatrics Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( PCDAI ) Pediatrics Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index ( PUCAI ) , respectively . Two age match group , first healthy child second chronic abdominal pain serve control .</detailed_description>
