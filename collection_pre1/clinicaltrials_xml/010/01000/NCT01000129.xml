	<brief_summary>To demonstrate radiotherapy treatment bladder cancer deliver great accuracy use new plan method method use simply effectively deliver treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adaptive Planning Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study integrate novel adaptive planning methodology , Adaptive-Planning Organ LOcalisation ( A-POLO ) , optimise margin cone beam CT technology improve accuracy radiotherapy treatment delivery . The previous study ( CCR2873 , REC 07/Q0801/13 ) evaluate use cone beam CT radiotherapy bladder cancer . A large expect number bladder radiotherapy treatment see deliver element geographic miss . Using novel adaptive planning method fraction radiotherapy could correctly treat . The feasibility method proven previous study , particularly show method appropriate provide simple solution problem . It carry radiographer treatment unit without add extra time treatment .</detailed_description>

No previous pelvic radiotherapy Written inform consent give accord ICH/GCP national/local regulation . Urinary catheter situ : presence urinary catheter degrades cone beam image quality thus image would evaluable . Patients urinary catheter would expect show variation bladder filling .</criteria>
