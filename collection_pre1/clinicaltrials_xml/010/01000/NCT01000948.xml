	<brief_title>A Safety Study ZD4054 Prior Chemotherapy Treated Patients With Metastatic Hormone-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study centre number patient plan This pilot study conduct approximately 24 patient recruit two hospital-based Danish centre : department Urology K , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby department Urologic Surgery D , Rigshospitalet . The recruitment patient competitive among centre . 1-2 month expect LSI discuss target accrual expand . Study period Phase development Estimated date first patient enrol August 1th 2009 II Estimated date last patient complete July 31th 2012 Total study duration approximately 36 month , include 12 month ' recruitment , 36-month follow-up safety final survival analysis . Objectives The primary objective study : To assess safety tolerability profile ZD4054 treatment chemotherapy - Adverse event - Vital sign - Laboratory data - ECGs - Physical Exam - Death cause The secondary objective study : 1 . To investigate effect ZD4054 rate rise PSA 2 . To investigate effect ZD4054 prostate cancer relate pain 3 . To investigate effect ZD4054 plasma concentration circulate tumour cell ( CTC ) . In addition , Time Progression Overall Survival ( time death ) compare historical data post chemotherapy population . Study design This prospective , Open , One-arm , Phase II clinical safety pilot-study . The trial design gain initial safety efficacy-related data once-daily orally administer ZD4054 10 mg prior chemotherapy treat patient metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer . Patients could receive therapy include prednisolone , estramustine , ketoconazole second-line third-line antiandrogens investigator 's discretion without consider treatment failure stop study therapy ; however every attempt make avoid change medication least 12 week minimise potential confounding study endpoint time period . Chemotherapy radiation therapy may also administer addition study therapy investigator 's discretion objective progression patient consider likely derive benefit . Patients follow death . Target patient population A total number 24 male patient age 18 year old metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer progressive disease ( define rise serum prostate-specific antigen level despite medical surgical castration ) previously receive cytotoxic chemotherapy ( docetaxel ) treatment HRPC . Investigational product , dosage mode administration Patients randomise patient receive : • ZD4054 10 mg give orally , daily tablet form . Duration treatment Patients receive daily ZD4054 long meet withdrawal criterion . Following completion 24 month ZD4054 , patient , investigator 's opinion experience benefit study treatment , may continue ZD4054 , long meet withdrawal criterion . Statistical method The study pilot study design collect safety/tolerability data ass marker efficacy . A total 24 patient recruit pilot study base primarily number patient recruit reasonable time period centre sufficient make initial assessment safety/tolerability efficacy marker . For assessment tolerability safety , incidence severity adverse event ( AEs ) ( base National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 3 ( NCI CTCAE ) grade ) , laboratory value , vital sign , ECGs physical exam summarise . Secondary endpoint present analysed investigate trend data . The interpretation analyse consider number assessment undertaken . Pain assess use Brief Pain Inventory Demography baseline data summarise . Any analyse perform use SPSS validate software appropriate .</detailed_description>
