	<brief_summary>The prevalence allergic rhinitis high appear rise worldwide . Therefore , important necessary understand visualize therapy effect disease . In study demonstrate effect levocetirizine nasal cavity dimension assess standard nasal flow diagnostics rhinomanometry acoustic rhinometry , supplement exami¬nation procedure long-term rhinometry magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . With aid virtual model computer fluid dynamic , able simulate nasal air flow provide three-dimensional visualization compute flow . In previous trial ( [ Bachert ] , [ deBlic ] , [ Day ] [ Deruaz ] ) show allergic symptom , especially nasal congestion , diminish significantly treatment levocetirizine . We demonstrate anti-obstructive effect compare reaction nasal allergen challenge four-week treatment levocetirizine .</brief_summary>
