	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . ( Primary Outcome ) To test hypothesis HydroSoft coil lead diminish rate aneurysm recurrence relative bare platinum coil . In order test hypothesis , compare recanalization recurrence rate observe prospective registry HydroSoft coil use finish coils historical series aneurysm treat bare platinum coil . This registry design achieve 80 % power detect minimally clinically relevant difference rate recurrence HydroSoft-treated aneurysm compare bare platinum coil . Based recent , prospective , randomized trial assess bare platinum coil hydrogel-bearing coil 25 % 15 % recurrence rate , respectively , predict recurrence rate 18 % HydroSoft treat aneurysm . Typically , `` minimally clinically relevant difference '' order 30 % diminution give undesirable outcome . As , registry well power detect minimally clinically relevant difference ( 18 % expect recurrence rate HydroSoft treat coil versus 25 % historical control group ) . Aim 2 . ( Secondary Outcome 1 ) To test hypothesis HydroSoft embolic coil place reliably intracranial , saccular aneurysm , even late embolization procedure . Success aim define ease placement HydroSoft device , without need coil removal subsequent `` finishing '' bare platinum coil . Aim 3 . ( Secondary Outcome 2 ) To test hypothesis use HydroSoft embolic coil associate risk thromboembolism similar coil type , order 3-5 % less .</detailed_description>
