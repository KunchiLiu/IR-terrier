	<brief_title>Study Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Advanced Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To validate ability intratumoral tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte ( TILs ) predict progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient suboptimally debulked advanced stage III IV ovarian epithelial cancer . II . To validate ability intratumoral TILs predict PFS patient optimally debulked disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To validate ability intratumoral TILs predict overall survival patient suboptimally debulked disease . II . To validate ability intratumoral TILs predict overall survival patient optimally debulked disease . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord status debulked disease ( suboptimal v optimal ) . Previously collect tumor tissue sample analyze tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) via immunohistochemistry double immunofluorescence assay use standard immunostaining .</detailed_description>
