	<brief_title>Collecting Storing Tissue Samples From Patients With Rare Cutaneous Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine clinical feature , treatment , outcome patient rare cutaneous pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . - To determine pathologic biologic feature disease , include molecular diagnostics flow cytometry . - To establish bank pathologically review disease make specimen blood tissue available qualified researcher . - To determine sub-groups disease could target future biologic , pathologic , therapeutic study . OUTLINE : On study data include present symptom sign , physical description tumor skin , result metastatic evaluation , stage ( available ) , blood count , marker , result viral serology . Any exist underlying condition could predispose lymphoma also note . Demographic outcomes data store maintained COG Research Data Center . Demographic data link specimen data BPC database . The approach study prospective data collection , include central pathologic review , relevant biologic study , submission material Biopathology Center ( BPC ) collection diagnostic outcome data . Participants register standard COG registration form documentation age , gender , race , date diagnosis , initial presentation , initial work-up , stage accord standard staging specific disease , initial diagnostic procedure , institutional diagnosis . Tissue send accord guideline Section 4.0 . Follow-up data , include relapse progression vital status report annually 5 year . Patients follow annually 5 year data collect include vital status , evidence/absence disease , type treatment receive , progression/relapse whether patient continue study .</detailed_description>
