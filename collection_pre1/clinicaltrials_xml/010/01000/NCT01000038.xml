	<brief_summary>Purpose study : Falls Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) common lead fracture , acute hospitalization increase rate institutionalization . Poor balance gait abnormality , commonly associate AD , risk factor fall . Improving balance gait abnormality critical prevent fall AD . Exercise intervention improve gait balance elderly . Walking commonly recommend home-based exercise program elderly primary care provider . However , difficult engage patient AD long term exercise program . Barriers exercise program include lack motivation , poor engagement , external factor cost physical therapy ( PT ) . Use readily available technology might bridge gap provide high level engagement via use multimedia affordable price . Wii-Fit Nintendo gaming console use aerobics , strength training , balance activity . This device include balance board sense weight , movement balance . Wii-Fit TV base self-directed activity limit constraint therapist 's presence . Virtual trainer talk user activity track progress . Furthermore , visual auditory feedback improve engagement . Some skilled nursing facility start use Wii-Fit adjunct PT , note improvement balance along social benefit systematic study do generalize finding . The investigator propose 8 week prospective randomize study treatment group receive exercise program deliver Wii-Fit system comparison arm receive walk exercise program .</brief_summary>
