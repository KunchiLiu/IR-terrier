	<brief_summary>Erlotinib inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase . Higher response rate observe subset patient female gender , Asian ethnicity , smoke history , mutation EGFR tyrosine kinase , high EGFR gene copy number adenocarcinoma histology . However , therapeutic effect Erlotinib confine patient whose tumor harbor EGFR mutation predictor efficacy agent . And test require time sufficiently large specimen processing , whereas many patient advance NSCLC diagnose base cytology alone . This study design evaluate FLT-PET FDG-PET usefulness early assessment treatment response predict patient outcome erlotinib monotherapy patient non-small cell lung cancer prospectively . Changes tumor FLT FDG uptake 7 day initiation treatment compare responder nonresponders base subsequent CT scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) During Erlotinib Treatment Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Primary objective : To see whether % change SUVmax tumor FLT-PET FDG-PET 7 day initiate erlotinib treatment compare baseline SUVmax ( ΔSUVmax ) would predict tumor 's responsiveness . And responsiveness decide CT scan 6 week erlotinib treatment . 2 . Secondary objective : To compare ΔSUVmax degree tumor shrinkage long diameter erlotinib treatment . To see ΔSUVmax tumor stable disease . To see time progression overall survival accord ΔSUVmax . To compare result FDG-PET FLT-PET .</detailed_description>
