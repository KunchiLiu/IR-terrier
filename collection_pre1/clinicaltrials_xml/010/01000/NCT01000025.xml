	<brief_title>PF-00299804 Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Not Responded Standard Therapy Advanced Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare overall survival patient incurable stage III IV non-small cell lung cancer receive PF-00299804 versus placebo failure standard therapy advance metastatic disease . Secondary - To compare overall survival KRAS-WT patient two arm . - To compare overall survival EGFR-mutant patient two arm . - To compare progression-free survival arm . - To compare objective response rate arm . - To estimate time response response duration patient . - To evaluate nature , severity , frequency toxicity arm . - To compare quality life arm . - To determine incremental cost-effectiveness cost-utility ratio PF-00299804 . - To correlate expression tumor blood marker ( diagnosis ) outcomes response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord center , performance status ( 0 1 v 2 3 ) , tobacco use ( never vs past present ) , best response prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( progressive disease v ) , weight loss ( &lt; 5 % v ≥ 5 % unknown ) , ethnicity ( East Asian v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral PF-00299804 daily . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood , serum , plasma , tissue sample collect examined biomarkers gene mutation , may bank future study . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire baseline periodically completion study treatment . Cost effectiveness cost utility PF-00299804 assess via Health Utilities Index ( EQ-5D ) Resource Utilization Assessment periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Histologically confirm diagnosis nonsmall cell carcinoma lung . Patients must adequate histopathology cytology specimen must consent release specimen protocol , centre/pathologist must agree submission specimen . Patients must evidence disease , measurable disease mandatory . To consider evaluable complete partial response assessment , patient must least one measurable lesion follow : Xray ≥ 20 mm Spiral CT scan physical exam ≥ 10 mm ( lymph node must ≥ 15 mm short axis ) ; Measurable lesion must outside previous radiotherapy field sole site disease , unless disease progression document . Male female , 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 3 . Patients performance status 3 eligible provide investigator attest patient reasonable life expectancy ( ≥ 6 week ) . Adequate renal hepatic function define follow required laboratory value obtain within 14 day prior randomization . If anemic , patient asymptomatic decompensated . Creatinine &lt; 1.5 upper limit normal Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 upper limit normal ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal . Note : If clearly attributable liver metastasis , ALT ( SGPT ) value &lt; 5 time upper limit normal permit . Previous Therapy Failure treatment regimen define inability continue regimen reason include , limited , progressive disease , toxicity , patient request . Up maximum three line chemotherapy advanced/metastatic disease ( define ) least one erlotinib gefitinib advanced/ metastatic disease ( define ) fail . Exchange one chemotherapy agent another within combination chemotherapy regimen consider new regimen follow circumstance carboplatin substitute cisplatin due nephrotoxicity one agent combination regimen change due hypersensitivity occur first cycle . Chemotherapy Advanced/Metastatic Disease : Patients must recover reversible toxic effect least 21 day must elapse last dose prior randomization ( 14 day last dose chemotherapy regimen administer weekly schedule ) . Further palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy must plan . Patients &lt; 70 year : • Must receive 1 maximum 3prior chemotherapy regimen ( least one three must combination regimen least one must contain platinum ) . Patients ≥ 70 year ( generally accept time administration first regimen chemotherapy advanced disease ) : • Must receive 1 maximum 3 prior chemotherapy regimens disease . These may single agent chemotherapy regimens platinum agent require keep current standard practice . Adjuvant Chemotherapy : Patients may ALSO prior adjuvant therapy completely resect disease , provide complete least 12 month prior randomization . Adjuvant regimens &lt; 12 month prior randomization combine chemotherapy/radiation regimens irresectable locally advanced stage III disease ( irrespective timing ) , consider advanced/metastatic disease constitute one 3 permissible regimen . Patients must recover reversible treatment related toxicity prior randomization . EGFR Inhibitor Therapy : Patients may enrol failure prior gefitinib erlotinib advance metastatic disease . Patients receive adjuvant gefitinib erlotinib completely resect NSCLC recur &lt; 12 month discontinue erlotinib gefitinib eligible . Patients receive gefitinib erlotinib neoadjuvant therapy eligible . EGFR inhibitor therapy must discontinue least 21 day prior randomization . Patients discontinue prior gefitinib erlotinib therapy severe life threaten organ toxicity eligible . Patients may also receive EGFR active agent ( reversible oral agent monoclonal antibody vaccine ) addition erlotinib gefitinib may receive ANY prior irreversible EGFR inhibitor BIBW2992 , HKI272 ( neratinib ) . Maintenance Therapy : The chemotherapy agent/s continue long 46 cycle purpose 'maintenance ' consider one regimen ; another chemotherapy agent give 'maintenance ' intent , consider second regimen provide 'failure ' document . Patients receive erlotinib gefitinib 'maintenance ' intent completion 1st line chemotherapy eligible provide 'failure ' document . Radiation : Patients may prior radiation therapy provide minimum 14 day elapse end radiotherapy randomization onto study . ( Exceptions may make however , low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy . Patients must recover acute toxic effect radiation prior randomization . Previous Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide wound heal occur least 14 day elapse ( major surgery ) . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete quality life questionnaire . The baseline assessment must already complete . Inability ( illiteracy , loss sight , equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment followup . All randomized patient must follow treated participate centre . Investigators must assure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient randomization . Ineligibility Criteria Patients fulfill follow criterion eligible admission study : Patients receive concurrent treatment experimental drug anticancer therapy . Patients experience untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) . Patients significant cardiac history , even control , LVEF &gt; 50 % . Patients untreated brain meningeal metastasis eligible ( CT scan require rule unless clinical suspicion CNS disease ) . Patients treat CNS disease radiologic clinical evidence stable brain metastasis , evidence cavitation hemorrhage brain lesion , eligible provide asymptomatic require corticosteroid ( must discontinue steroid least 1 week prior randomization ) . Patients active uncontrolled infection , serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol , include Severe dry eye syndrome Keratoconjunctivitis sicca Sjogren 's syndrome Severe exposure keratopathy Disorders might increase risk epitheliumrelated complication ( e.g. , bullous keratopathy , aniridia , severe chemical burn , neutrophilic keratitis ) Uncontrolled inflammatory gastrointestinal disease ( Crohn 's , ulcerative colitis etc . ) Prior pneumonitis/ILD secondary EGFR inhibitor Mean QTc Bazetts correction &gt; 470msec screen ECG history familial long QT syndrome . Drugs highly dependent CYP2D6 metabolism prohibit , since PF804 potent CYP2D6 inhibitor vitro assay . These inhibitor inducer prohibit 7 day prior first dose end treatment PF804 . These include : Smetoprolol , propafenone , timolol , amitriptyline , clomipramine , desipramine , imipramine , paroxetine , haloperidol , risperidone , thioridazine , codeine , flecainide , mexilletine , tamoxifen , venlafaxine . Lidocaine may use clinical monitoring ( include telemetry ) . Opiates morphine , oxycodone , dihydrocodeine , hydrocodone , tramadol use substitute replace codeine . Use opiate monitor altered analgesia treatment PF804 may partly metabolize CYP2D6 . If PF804 administer drug Pglycoprotein ( Pgp ) substrates narrow therapeutic index , monitoring exaggerated effect and/or toxicity recommend . Pregnancy inadequate contraception . Women must postmenopausal , surgically sterile , use two reliable form contraception . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test take proven negative within 7 day prior randomization . Men must surgically sterile use barrier method contraception .</criteria>
