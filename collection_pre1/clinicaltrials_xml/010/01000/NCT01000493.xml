	<brief_summary>This 12-week , randomize , multicenter , double-blind , placebo control , fixed-dose parallel group study assess efficacy safety orvepitant ( 60 mg/day ) versus placebo subject diagnosis noncombat-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , whose symptom consider moderate severe . Following initial screen visit , subject fulfil study inclusion exclusion criterion enter pre-treatment screen phase permit evaluation laboratory ECG assessment confirm eligibility inclusion study . This screen phase minimum 7 day , longer 21 day . At completion screen period , eligible subject randomize baseline visit receive either orvepitant 60mg/day placebo ( 1:1 ratio ) . Those subject randomize receive placebo receive study medication identical appearance receive subject assign receive orvepitant . Efficacy assess use Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) primary efficacy measure . Key secondary efficacy endpoint base Davidson Trauma Scale ( DTS ) , Short PTSD Rating Interview ( SPRINT ) , Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement Severity Illness Scales ( CGI-I CGI-S , respectively ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) , Cognitive Physical Functioning Questionnaire ( CPFQ ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) . Safety assess monitor adverse event ( side effect ) periodic laboratory evaluation ( blood test ) , vital sign assessment ( e.g. , blood pressure , heart rate , temperature ) heart function measurement ( electrocardiogram , ECGs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose current study test safety effect orvepitant , investigational drug treatment noncombat-related PTSD . Efficacy assess use standard symptom severity rating scale ( questionnaire ) . The Clinicain Adminstered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) serve primary measure efficacy . Secondary efficacy endpoint include CAPS subscale cluster ( Re-Experiencing , Avoidance Numbing , Hyperarousal ) , Davidson Trauma Scale ( DTS ) , Short PTSD Rating Interview ( SPRINT ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) , Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement Severity Illness Scale ( CGI-I CGI-S , respectively ) , Cognitive Physical Functioning Questionnaire ( CPFQ ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) . Safety tolerability assess monitoring adverse event ( AEs side effect ) , physical examination ( include vital sign blood pressure heart rate ) , clinical laboratory assessment ( blood test ) , electrical recording heart ( electrocardiograms ECG 's ) , Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) , Massachusetts Sexual Function Questionnaire ( MSFQ ) , Discontinuation-Emergent Signs Symptoms ( DESS ) scale weight change . Blood sample take different time point assess blood level orvepitant patient , allow relationship amount orvepitant body efficacy study . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy orvepitant ( 60mg/day ) versus placebo ( `` sugar pill '' , active ingredient ) . The secondary objective include assess safety tolerability orvepitant , assess profile appearance disappearance orvepitant body ( blood ) follow administration ( i.e. , assess long drug remain body ) , lastly examine relationship blood level drug efficacy ( i..e , change CAPS score relative start study medication ) . Following initial screen visit , subject fulfil study entrance criterion enter pre-treatment screen phase permit evaluation laboratory electrocardiogram assessment confirm eligibility inclusion study . This screen phase minimum 7 day , longer 21 day . Upon completion screen period , eligible subject randomly assign baseline visit one two treatment regimen : orvepitant 60mg/day placebo 12-week treatment phase . The chance receive two possible treatment equal . Orvepitant administer tablet . Those subject randomise receive placebo receive study medication identical appearance receive subject assign receive orvepitant . During treatment phase , subject require return clinic end Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 . In addition , subject require return follow-up visit 14 day last dose study medication . In addition , subject ongoing adverse event 14-day follow-up visit require return follow-up visit 28 day last dose study medication . Women child-bearing potential also require attend 28-Day follow-up visit pregnancy test . A test perform 42 Days follow end treatment . Male female outpatient age 18 64 year inclusive primary diagnosis noncombat-related PTSD enrol study . A total approximately 240 subject expect enrol approximately 25 different study site North America .</detailed_description>
