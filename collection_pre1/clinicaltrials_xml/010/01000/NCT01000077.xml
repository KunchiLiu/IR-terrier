	<brief_title>Establishment Cell Culture Systems From Discarded Operating Room Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy diseased tissue harvest tissue routinely discard NCBH operate room , delivery room Forsyth Medical Center routine operative childbirth procedure . Samples identify source disease state . Disease state may several type include inflammation , malignancy , fibrosis , atherosclerosis , hyperplasia etc . These tissue sample promptly transport sterile condition Institute Regenerative Medicine . The tissue break individual cell mechanical enzymatic method , dilute growth medium inoculate onto sterile tissue culture flask . The flask place 4 % CO2 incubator culture . The culture cultivate primary progenitor cell eventual RNA extraction expression profile . These cell line may use future vitro vivo research study yet determine . An Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) must approve future research study use tissue sample . Source Specimens : Healthy diseased tissue variety source ( example include bladder , foreskin , heart valve , blood vessel , prostate , kidney , uterus , ovary , salivary gland tissue , lacrimal gland tissue , muscle tissue , epithelial tissue , nerve tissue vascular tissue patient undergo surgery ) harvest tissue routinely discard NCBH operate room routine operative procedure . In addition , normal term placenta obtain follow vaginal delivery Forsyth Medical Center . No patient identify information retain . No attempt make match establish cell line derive tissue sample source patient . Eligibility protocol restrict indication surgical excision tissue question . Confidentiality Considerations : No patient identifier collect . It possible identify link tissue individual patient source way deliver Institute . The information identify specimen tissue source , age sex patient , disease state ( ) . Informed consent obtain . Sample Size : Approximately 1000 people take part study , Wake Forest University Health Sciences Forsyth Medical Center .</detailed_description>
