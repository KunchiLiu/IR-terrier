	<brief_summary>Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) hereditary anemia cause red blood cell change shape round doughnut-like shape half-moon/crescent , sickled shape . People SCD different type hemoglobin ( protein carry oxygen ) . This different type hemoglobin make red blood cell change crescent shape certain condition . Sickle-shaped cell problem often get stuck blood vessel block flow blood cause inflammation injury important area body . All baby bear hemoglobin call fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) . Soon birth , HbF production slow another hemoglobin call adult hemoglobin ( HbA ) make . Clinical study show increase amount HbF blood may prevent sickling red blood cell . Vorinostat use treatment cancer research study information suggest may help treat SCD increase amount HbF blood . The purpose research study determine effectiveness safety vorinostat use treat SCD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Vorinostat Induce Fetal Hemoglobin Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy vorinostat ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid , SAHA ) , administer orally , pulsed fashion , once-a-day 3 consecutive day every week , induce 4 % absolute increase 100 % increase fetal hemoglobin percent level ( HbF % ) subject severe sickle cell disease fail prior therapy . - To characterize safety tolerability . Secondary - To assess effect vorinostat F-cell level . - To determine change y-globin , B-globin E-globin RNA level treatment vorinostat . - To describe dose-response characteristic vorinostat induce fetal hemoglobin sickle cell disease . Exploratory - To determine extent duration global histone acetylation intermittent vorinostat dose . - To correlate status polymorphism near BCL11A , c-myb , HBB gene locus , associate level fetal hemoglobin , assess association polymorphism status therapeutic response vorinostat . - To evaluate red blood cell rheology treatment vorinostat . STATISTICAL DESIGN : This single stage design evaluate induction HbF treatment target enrollment 15 patient . A 25 % success rate consider evidence activity patient population 5 % success rate deem ineffective . If least 3 patient achieved success , treatment would consider promising . With 15 eligible patient , probability observe 0.76 assume true rate 25 % 0.04 assume true rate 5 % .</detailed_description>
