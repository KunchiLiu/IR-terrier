	<brief_title>EPOCH Chemotherapy Bortezomib Associated T-Cell Leukemia Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint : - To determine tolerability efficacy ( response rate ) dose adjust bortezomib-EPOCH ( DA B-EPOCH ) chemotherapy combine Raltegravir patient HTLV-1 associate leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL ) . Secondary Endpoints : - To evaluate effect DA B-EPOCH chemotherapy combine Raltegravir HTLV-1 DNA RNA load , HTLV-1 integrase gene sequence , HTLV-1 integration site . To determine relapse progressive disease result renew virus replication . - To evaluate relation NFκB gene expression profile response DA B-EPOCH chemotherapy combine Raltegravir .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically document ATLL . Patients previously untreated treated ATLL eligible . Tumors must CD3 positive ( &gt; 50 % cell express CD3 ) . Documented HTLV1 infection : documentation may serologic assay ( ELISA , Western blot ) Confirmation HTLV1 rather HTLV2 differential Western blot ( e.g . Genelabs Diagnostics HTLV Blot 2.4 ) PCR desirable result require prior trial enrollment . Measurable disease must present . These node mass select accord following : clearly measurable least two perpendicular dimension ; possible disparate region body ; include mediastinal retroperitoneal area disease whenever site involved.For patient acute ( leukemic ) form ATLL , measureable disease derive CD4+ lymphocyte flow data peripheral blood and/or bone marrow . All stage eligible . Adequate hematologic function within 14 day enrollment : ANC &gt; 1000 cells/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 75,000 cells/mm3 unless cytopenias secondary ATLL . All patient must hematologic growth factor least 24 hr . Adequate hepatic function , transaminase &lt; 3 time upper limit normal unless due Gilbert 's disease hepatic involvement tumor ; total bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 2.0 unless due lymphoma . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) least 50 Age least 18 . Voluntary write informed consent performance study relate procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Female patient child bear potential must negative pregnancy test within 72 hrs initiation therapy . Female patient either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use two acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) study . Male patient must agree use two acceptable method contraception duration study . Women must avoid pregnancy men avoid father child study . HIV positive patient eligible receive least two active antiHIV therapy zidovudine atazanavir . Patients active hepatitis B ( HBV ) infection eligible receive effective antiHBV therapy . Inclusion Women Minorities : Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial . Acute active infection require acute therapy . Chronic therapy potentially myelosuppressive agent allow provided entry hematologic criterion meet . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year enrollment , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum Bhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( BhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . Patient ≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . Patient hypersensitivity bortezomib , boron mannitol . Patient receive investigational drug 14 day enrollment Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin except determine related Gilbert 's disease tumor biliary/liver involvement .</criteria>
