	<brief_summary>Previous study show potentially high exposure fluticasone furoate Japanese subject compare Caucasian subject . The reason potential difference unclear . Therefore study do look compare fluticasone furoate process body healthy Caucasian , Japanese , Korean Chinese subject inhale intravenous administration . The data obtain use help clinical development drug Japanese East Asian population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Look Compare How Inhaled Intravenous Fluticasone Furoate Processed Body Healthy Caucasian , Japanese , Korean Chinese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids highly effective anti-inflammatory therapy allergic condition asthma rhinitis . Fluticasone Furoate ( FF ) novel corticosteroid potent glucocorticoid activity similar fluticasone propionate mometasone furoate . Phase II study show FF effective daily inhale steroid asthma develop potential steroid component daily combination GW642444M , once-daily administration maintenance treatment asthma COPD . FF approve worldwide ( include US , EU Japan ) intranasal steroid treatment allergic rhinitis ( VERAMYST™ /AVAMYS™ /ALLERMIST™ ) . Previous inter-study comparison indicate potentially high systemic exposure FF Japanese subject compare treatment group recruit predominantly Caucasian subject . The reason potential difference unclear . This study perform evaluate directly compare PK systemic PD effect FF healthy Caucasian , Japanese , Korean Chinese subject deliver novel dry powder inhaler intravenously . The data obtain used facilitate clinical development FF/GW642444 combination Japanese East Asian population .</detailed_description>
