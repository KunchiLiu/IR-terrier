	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes major public health problem India estimate prevalence approximately 4 % 12 % rural urban area respectively . Accumulating evidence suggest serum cholecalciferol level may inversely related prevalence diabetes , insulin resistance metabolic syndrome . The trial available effect Vitamin D supplementation insulin/glucose metabolism conduct use small sample size different subgroup document variable result ( significant decrease HbA1c concentration insulin concentration hemodialysis patient ; insulin level low oral Vitamin D gestational diabetes ; effect Vitamin D serum insulin level post menopausal woman ) . A double blind randomize control trial conduct institute use 3,60,000 IU cholecalciferol 6 week document improvement OGIS index insulin sensitivity . We therefore , plan study long term effect vitamin D supplementation peripheral insulin sensitivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Study Effect Long Term Vitamin D Supplementation Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers recruit amongst preventive health check subject , neighbor office , hospital employee corporate associate SBISR obtain detail informed consent . The study include 300 subject follow selection criterion . INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . 35 75 year age 2 . Waist circumference ( WC ) ≥78 cm men ≥ 72 cm woman Recruited subject randomize two group basis random number generate computer pre-stratification gender ( allow equal representation sex ) baseline Vitamin D level . The baseline information record standardized questionnaire include age , education , marital status , annual household income , family history , smoke alcohol use . A complete physical examination do include height , weight , waist circumference blood pressure . Weight record manual weigh scale ( sensitivity 500 g ) , height use SECA stadiometer ( sensitivity 0.1 cm ) , waist circumference ( WC ) midpoint lower rib iliac crest use measure tape ( sensitivity 0.1 cm ) , blood pressure use OMRON electronic instrument ( sensitivity 1 mmHg ; accuracy 3 mmHg ) validate earlier trial . Height , WC weight record light clothing without shoe . Three serial BP recording right arm take 10 minute rest 10 minute interval sit posture per WHO recommendation . The mean three recording use analysis . Daily sun exposure calculate take detailed history sun exposure separately summer winter type clothing worn . Sun exposure calculate hour exposure per day x percentage body surface area ( BSA ) expose ( calculate accord Wallace rule nine ) . A detailed dietary assessment 24 hour recall method do baseline determine dietary intake calcium , phosphate Vitamin D. Consenting subject advise fast 8 pm previous night . 10 ml blood draw baseline follow test 9 10 next day . - 25 ( OH ) vitamin D level - Serum calcium phosphorus - Liver function test include total protein , SGOT , SGPT alkaline phosphatase - Serum creatinine level The 3-hour Oral GTT do load glucose dose 75 gram blood sample 0 , 120 180 minute . The sample arm warm 20 minute prior sample obtain arterialized venous sample . The blood sample immediately transport laboratory plasma separate sample immediately . The sample label random number ( avoid reveal time sequence sample laboratory ) store -70 C assay . The subject treatment group give cholecalciferol 120,000 IU monthly orally one year ( ~ 4000 IU per day ) . This dose document safe earlier review.The drug advise provided subject enrollment . The control group receive placebo identical taste , color texture . The subject advise continue normal routine lifestyle report immediately vomit , headache , blur vision , abdominal pain , muscle cramp hematuria hospital admission . For purpose trial hypercalcemia would define &gt; 2.65 mmol/L , Urinary calcium : creatinine ratio ultrasonography do clinically indicate . Any volunteer develop adverse effect would treat recommend free charge.. Compliance monitor mean home diary . A mid-term follow-up do 6 month recruitment . Instructions reinforce 6 month follow-up especially subject poor compliance deviation . Final assessment do 1 year ( margin +10 day ) recruitment . Follow assessment subject febrile illness postpone till 5 day recovery fever . A detailed dietary assessment 72 hour recall method do baseline two follow visit determine dietary intake calcium , , phosphate Vitamin D. All investigation do baseline repeat two follow-up visit . The investigator laboratory blind random allocation code broken report available subject . Outcome measure : The oral glucose sensitivity index calculate Mari 's formula measure post prandial insulin sensitivity evaluate primary outcome variable change index compare supplement unsupplemented group . The HOMA QUICKI indices similarly analyze secondary outcome indicate fast insulin sensitivity . The incidence adverse effect also compare two group secondary outcome . Biochemical Analysis The sample centrifuge 3000 rpm serum/plasma would store -70 C. Serum 25 ( OH ) D measure solvent extraction follow radioimmunoassay ( Diasorin , USA ) . Plasma Insulin measure double antibody IRMA ( IMMUNOTECH , France ) . PTH level also estimate use double antibody IRMA ( IMMUNOTECH , France ) . 5 % sample re-run quality control . Sample size consideration It estimate sample size 98 subject group require detect change OGIS ( Oral Glucose insulin sensitivity ; primary outcome variable ) 10 % alpha error 0.05 power 90 % base data available earlier trial conduct institute subject . To account attrition one year 150 subject group recruit . Data Analysis Data entry analysis do use Epi-Info 2002 SPSS v13.0 software . The value plasma glucose insulin specify time use calculate follow index OGIS calculate use Mari 's formula describe elsewhere primary outcome variable . HOMA QUICKI index calculate fast insulin glucose sample . The student's't ' test pair value use estimate pre post intervention difference group . The crude mean difference two group compare use unpaired't ' test . Non- compliant subject trial deviate analyse group allocate 'Intention treat ' analysis exclude `` per protocol analysis '' study difference group . The outcome adjust known confounders include age , waist circumference , BMI , baseline insulin sensitivity , change Vitamin D PTH level . The subject stratify baseline 25 ( OH ) D level deficient non-deficient analysis . Regression analysis use study relationship baseline characteristic outcome variable .</detailed_description>
