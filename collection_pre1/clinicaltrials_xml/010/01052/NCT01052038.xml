	<detailed_description>Sore throat common postoperative complaint lead morbidity patient dissatisfaction . The incidence sore throat report 6 % 90 % even optimal intubate condition . There several factor show contribute postoperative sore throat patient related factor , type anesthesia type surgery . It observe gargle azunol reduce incidence postoperative sore throat 65 % 25 % . Similarly , reduction sore throat follow tracheal intubation 78 % 40 % report gargle ketamine perform 5 minute induction anesthesia . More recently , also demonstrate preoperative gargle licorice result 57 percent reduction absolute risk sore throat intubation . Although gargle technique show successful decrease incidence postoperative sore throat , limited feasibility volume administer could increase chance aspiration ingest may difficult perform sedated patient child . Tracheal intubation associate increase polymorphonuclear cell tracheal tissue plasma level interleukin 6 , suggest inflammatory response presence endotracheal tube aspect intubation process . Dexamethasone widely prescribe treatment sore throat result tracheal mechanical irritation due modulating effect tissue edema pain . Moreover , prophylactic dexamethasone show effective reducing frequency airway obstruction patient high risk laryngeal edema follow extubation . It decrease postoperative sore throat patient require double-lumen tube . Dexamethasone show decrease postoperative sore throat patient require hospital admission evaluate ambulatory setting . Ambulatory patient usually need return work faster patient admitted hospital . Their ability tolerate fluid food might help return normal living . They also small surgery might increase perception sore throat pain compare big , painful procedure . Possible side effect corticosteroids retardation wound healing , susceptibility infection gastrointestinal hemorrhage note short term use ( &lt; 24 hour ) surgical patient . Corticosteroids also commonly used perioperative period potentiate analgesic antiemetic .</detailed_description>
