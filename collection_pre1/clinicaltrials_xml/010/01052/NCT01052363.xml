	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm grade III Anaplastic glioma ( include anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma , anaplastic oligoastrocytoma ) Grade IV Glioblastoma multiforme . 2 . Recurrence progression fail first line treatment temozolomide chemotherapy radiation . Patient fail additional line treatment eligible participate trial . Patients must measurable disease , define contrast enhance measurable disease MRI brain . Baseline MRI do 2 week start treatment . 3 . At least 4 week since prior chemotherapy radiation therapy , 4 week last regimen include BCNU . 4 . Age great 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use fosbretabulin combination bevacizumab patient le 18 year age , child exclude study . 5 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 6 . ECOG performance status 02 Karnofsky great 60 % ) . 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define . 8 . The effect fosbretabulin develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason vascular disrupting agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childâ€”bearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant ( include female partner male study participant ) suspect pregnant participating study , inform Investigator treat physician immediately . 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Patients prior treatment use bevacizumab . 3 . Patients receive investigational agent within 4 week . 4 . History abdominal fistula , GI perforation intraabdominal abscess within last 6 month . 5 . Coagulopathy bleed diathesis . Patients therapeutic dose anticoagulation exclude study . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Also , MI/unstable angina within 6 month ; stroke/TIA within 1 year ; symptomatic claudication within 1 year ; abnormality ECG include prolonged QTc interval ( i.e . &gt; 450 m male &gt; 470 ms female ) , new Qwave , RBBB , LBBB , STsegment depression . 7 . Grade 3 proteinuria ( &gt; 3.5 g protein/24 hour ) 8 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 150/100 Screening ) 9 . Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease . 10 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition fosbretabulin agent use study . 11 . Since dilantin induces P450 system effect fosbretabulin bezvacazimab know , patient seizure prophylaxis dilantin eligible . Switching seizure prophylaxis noninducers P450 system levetiracetam acceptable . Patients must dilantin one week start clinical trial . Additionally fosbretabulin potential interact drug metabolize CYP2C19 include barbiturate , diazepam valproic acid . However clinical significance interaction know . 12 . Pregnant woman exclude study fosbretabulin vascular disrupting agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother fosbretabulin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated fosbretabulin . 13 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible Because potential pharmacokinetic interaction fosbretabulin . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
