	<brief_summary>Specific Aims The long-term objective study examine effectiveness intervention program old patient hip fracture . First , intervention program elderly patient hip fracture develop implement , , effectiveness intervention program examine . The specific aim follow : 1 . To develop well conceive feasible protocol hospital discharge sub-acute care involve coordinate work health care professional ( physician , surgeon , nurse , physical therapist ) informal caregiver . The feasibility implement protocol within context intervention study subject constraint clinical setting ( i.e. , CGMH ) evaluate pilot study . 2 . To conduct randomized clinical trial evaluate outcome cost associate proposed hospital discharge/sub-acute care protocol elderly patient hip fracture . Both experimental case study method use . Information outcome indicator include clinical outcome , quality life , self-care ability , family caregiving outcome , patient caregiver satisfaction , service utilization collect compare control group experimental group . 3 . To conduct validation clinical trial verify result primary randomize clinical trial increase generalization study finding . 4 . To estimate cost care model variation individual patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The percentage elderly person Taiwan continually increase , 2.5 % 1951 8.26 % 1998 ; current number elderly 1,811,335 . As country increase age population , hip fracture represent major grow health care problem Taiwan . Hip fracture result 15,000 hospital admission 1997 . It estimate incidence rate ( per 100 , 000 ) hip fracture Taiwan 211 Taiwan 's elderly population 1993 , 10 time incidence rate general population . Despite advanced treatment , one-year mortality rate hip fracture remain significant ( 15.4 % ) , majority patient never recover completely term activity daily live . The economic cost hip fracture among elderly huge family suffer caregiving burden . Many study United States show elderly patient hip fracture benefit post-operative rehabilitation , early discharge planning , transitional care . However , little known intervention attempt patient family caregiver Taiwan . The purpose experimental study therefore explore effectiveness intervention program old patient hip fracture . The cost care model also estimate . An intervention program develop first year . This program administer multidisciplinary health care team include geriatric consultation service , in-hospital in-home rehabilitation program discharge plan component . During first year , pilot study consist 10 elderly patient hip fracture caregiver experimental group 10 control group test feasibility intervention program establish reference point sample size modification . In second third year , primary clinical trial conduct Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Lin Kuo . In study , 120 subject meet sample criterion recruit randomly assign experimental control group . Patients experimental group receive regular hospital routine care intervention program . Patients control group receive routine hospital care . The outcome variable include clinical outcome , self-care ability , quality life , family caregiving outcome , patient caregiver 's satisfaction , service utilization ; data collect one year hospital discharge compare experimental control group . Data cost care also collect . A qualitative component include in-depth interview five patient family caregiver experimental group , five control group five health care provider , explore effect intervention program detail . In fourth fifth year , validation clinical trial conduct 120 subject . The intervention program implement different medical center validate result primary clinical trial . The study result provide suggestion intervention protocols elderly person hip fracture guideline development intervention program high-risk elderly person Taiwan . The finding also provide reference clinical hospital administration decision .</detailed_description>
