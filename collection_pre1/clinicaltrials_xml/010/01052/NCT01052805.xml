	<detailed_description>Diabetic foot occur 15 % diabetic population ( 3 ) 15 % diabetic foot patient end low limb amputation . Peripheral neuropathy ( sensory , motor autonomic ) , peripheral vascular disease , trauma , infection poor wound heal contribute diabetic foot problem . Peripheral neuropathy could evaluate variety way , include vibratory threshold , thermal threshold , pressure perception threshold , muscle strength . All predict foot ulceration degree ( 1 ) . Motor nerve conduction velocity independent predictor development new foot ulcer diabetic population . For detailed structural study neuropathy diabetic patient , could use skin biopsy method . Skin biopsy PGP9.5 immunohistochemistry demonstrate ultrastructural study label terminal portion small myelinated unmyelinated nerve epidermis ( 5 ) . Intra-epidermal nerve fiber ( IENF ) density reduce patient impair glucose tolerance clinically overt diabetes ( 5 ) . Previous IENF density study perform diabetic patient sensory symptom foot ulcer . Now tried evaluate IENF density severe diabetic foot patient receive knee amputation . Skin biopsy perform amputated leg . The skin biopsy area locate lateral side distal leg , 10 cm lateral malleolus previous protocol group ( 6 ) . Underlying sural nerve posterior tibial nerve also harvest ultra-structural study . We previous IRB `` Pathology skin , nerve vasculature amputate limb diabetes '' . However , pathology normal control nerve important compare pathology nerve amputate limb diabetes . For parotid cancer patient receive radical parotidectomy , facial nerve frequently sacrifice . Sural nerve frequently harvest reconstruction . Sural nerve also frequently use ther nerve construction surgery . During operation , could harvest 2 cm sural nerve normal nerve pathology study . For cadaveric donor patient , also could harvest normal nerve control study .</detailed_description>
