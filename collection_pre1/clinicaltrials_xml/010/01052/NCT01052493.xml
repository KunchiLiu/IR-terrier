	<brief_summary>When human eat , bowel naturally secrete chemical bloodstream make people feel full stop eating . One chemical know `` Pancreatic Polypeptide '' ( PP ) . We previously show injection human PP reduce appetite food intake . We develop similar chemical , PP 1420 , treatment obesity . PP 1420 tested animal show safe , reduce appetite . This study test PP 1420 safety tolerability human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A First-Time-in-Human Study Assess Safety Tolerability PP 1420 Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 20 percent people UK obese . People obesity short life expectancy , high risk heart attack , stroke , high blood pressure , diabetes , certain cancer . At moment , treatment obesity effective safe . Advising people change diet exercise frequently ineffective , loss weight see usually temporary . There couple license medication purpose lose weight , limited side effect . Finally , gastric bypass similar surgery effective reduce weight permanently , risky restrict motivated people . `` Gut hormone '' natural chemical make bowel eat . They work reduce appetite hunger eat , eat enough need . We think one reason gastric bypass surgery effective surgery cause increase gut hormone secretion bloodstream , suppress appetite . One hormones pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) , release bloodstream cell pancreas eating . When human PP give healthy volunteer injection , see reduce appetite food intake side effect feel sick vomiting . Human PP last long blood stream . In order make new , safe effective drug obesity , develop new form PP , similar identical human PP , expect last long blood . We call PP 1420 . In test , PP 1420 reduce food intake animal , safe much high dos plan give current study . This study ass safety tolerability PP 1420 human , first time human give medication .</detailed_description>
