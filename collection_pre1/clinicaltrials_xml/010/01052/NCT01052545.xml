	<brief_title>Asymptomatic Bacteriuria Guideline Implementation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impacts Veterans ' Healthcare : Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) single common hospital-acquired infection . However , majority case nosocomial catheter-associated urinary tract infection ( CAUTI ) really asymptomatic bacteriuria ( ABU ) . ABU clinically significant condition , treatment unlikely confer benefit . Overtreatment ABU quality , safety , cost issue , particularly unnecessary antibiotic lead emergence resistant flora . Our proposal bring clinical practice line publish guideline significant potential decrease CAUTI associate inappropriate antibiotic use VA hospital . Our study also provide information maximize effectiveness audit-feedback achieve guideline adherence inpatient VA setting . Project Background/Rationale : Evidence-based guideline recommend provider neither screen treat ABU catheterize patient . However , significant gap guideline clinical practice document VA hospital throughout world . Since many VA patient acute care setting sub-acute care setting , intermediate long-term care , legitimate need urinary catheter , issue overtreatment catheter-associated ABU active problem VA. Project Objectives : We hypothesize implement exist evidence-based guideline non-treatment ABU dramatically reduce unnecessary use antibiotic treat ABU incidence incorrectly diagnose CAUTI . Our first objective improve quality care concern ABU term specific clinical outcome ( inappropriate screening treatment ABU ) implementation audit-feedback strategy . We also hypothesize successful implementation audit-feedback strategy result measurable change clinician ' knowledge attitude concern ABU practice guideline . Our second objective ass survey effect implementation clinician ' guideline awareness , familiarity , acceptance , outcome expectancy . Project Methods : Our guideline implementation strategy employ audit-feedback , apply post-prescription antimicrobial review base establish guideline . The study population clinical outcome inpatient certain ward intervention site ( Houston VA ) control site ( San Antonio VA ) . Our study population audit-feedback intervention survey health care provider ward . We propose 3-year study . During first year observe baseline incidence inappropriate screening treatment ABU sit . Blinded monitoring clinical outcome continue next 2 year study . During second year , distribute guideline site . Clinicians intervention site receive individualize feedback , either telephone person , whether management bacteriuria guideline-compliant . Unit-level feedback also provide . During third year , individualized feedback cease , unit-level feedback continue constitute sustainable intervention . Clinicians complete pre/post survey awareness , familiarity , acceptance , outcome expectancy intervention site year 2 site year 3 . Differences outcomes individualize intervention year 2 group-level intervention year 3 help determine necessary intensity intervention dissemination implementation VA facility .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Objective 1 ( Clinical Outcomes ) , inpatient MEDVAMC STVHCS unit interest ( medicine ECL ) 3 year period study include chart review process . For Objective 2 , modify health care provider knowledge behavior auditfeedback survey , attempt involve health care provider rotation VA target ward study period . The auditfeedback intervention apply health care provider target ward make decision treat CAUTI . For chart review component , want capture available data clinical outcome study period . We need review inpatient roster ward interest several time per week determine many patient urinary catheter , etc . We also wish survey many health care provider possible rotate ward interest study period . We anticipate health care provider work VA hospital competent provide refuse consent participate .</criteria>
