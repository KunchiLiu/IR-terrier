	<brief_summary>The principle objective study validate confocal endomicroscopy ( CEM ) national , multicenter study , term ability diagnose neoplastic lesion vivo , two group patient high risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) : patient familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) colectomy neoplastic lesion probably under-diagnosed , patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) endoscopic surveillance particularly difficult . Methods : The study comprise two phase ( Phase I II ) . Phase I serve validate multicenter level result first , recently publish , monocenter German study term capacity CEM identify colonic neoplastic lesion vivo . Phase II destine prospectively evaluate diagnostic yield CEM detection prediction neoplastic lesion develop add new feature confocal pattern vivo diagnosis . Two cohort patient study parallel : Patients inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , like ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , include plan colectomy , patient FAP colectomy . During low endoscopy perform general anaesthesia , colonic segment examine stain indigo-carmin . After intra-venous fluorescein injection , macroscopically abnormal lesion examine CEM , biopsied . In parallel , multiple random biopsy perform , couple simultaneous CEM `` optical biopsy '' point . In addition , Phase II , IBD patient plan colectomy patient FAP , `` mapping '' colonic mucosa , obtain high number CEM `` optical biopsy '' , perform , correlated standard histology perform either colectomy specimen ( IBD ) standard biopsy ( FAP ) . Principal analysis ( Phase I II ) include evaluation inter-observer variation term interpretation vivo histology diagnostic yield CEM respect detection neoplastic lesion evaluation sensitivity specificity , use standard histology reference method . Additional analysis ( Phase II ) perform evaluate diagnostic predictive ( CRC risk ) value `` colonic mapping '' correlate optical image pattern score result standard histology . Expected result : This study guarantee high quality data , standardization procedure interpretation CEM image , prerequisite dissemination CEM clinical practice . The investigator expect show CME allow reliably discriminate neoplastic non-neoplastic lesion , , compare standard histology , provide good characterization lesion , especially context extended lesion like IBD , finally , CME image use develop new `` optical biopsy '' -based score allow prediction high CRC risk patient FAP IBD . The investigator believe CEM may increase , compare currently use technique , diagnostic yield term probability detection neoplastic lesion patient high risk CCR , may become new standard endoscopic surveillance patient .</brief_summary>
