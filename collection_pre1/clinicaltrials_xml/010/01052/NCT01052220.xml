	<brief_title>Improving Blood Pressure Control End-Stage Renal Disease Through Supportive-Educative Nursing Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 Participants recruit study . The participant randomize either intervention control group . Randomization occur accord Hemodialysis ( HD ) unit participant dialyzes . The intervention consist 3 phase : 1 ) education session , 2 ) 12 week intervention 3 ) 30 day post intervention follow-up period . The intervention group receive two 15 minute individual education session conduct research coordinator HD unit . The objective session 1 : 1 ) explain underlying pathophysiology associate risk high BP HD , 2 ) identify goal improve BP control 3 ) describe role self-regulation change behavior relate BP control . The objective Session 2 include : provide demonstrate correct participant use home BP monitor , correct record home BPs , 24 hr fluid recall salt intake checklist . The participant also receive educational pamphlet method improve salt fluid restriction . The participant treatment group ask monitor record home BP , salt fluid intake weekly 12 week . The research coordinator weekly 10 15 minute visit intervention participant HD unit . The PI review BP fluid log salt check list participant determine predetermine goal BP control attain . When goal relate BP control meet , positive verbal reinforcement give participant . When goal relate BP control meet , exploration problem solve do . The control group receive standard care involve BP monitor medication adjustment health care provider weekly basis HD unit need . At end study , intervention control group receive home BP monitor compensation participation . The baseline survey administer initiation study include : 1 ) Modified Mini Mental State Exam ( 3MS ) measure global cognitive function , 2 ) Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) screen measure depression , 3 ) ESSI Social Support Instrument measure participant 's level social support , 4 ) BP Control HD Knowledge Scale measure participant 's comprehension behavior necessary BP control HD 5 ) BP Control HD Self-efficacy Scale use measure self confidence ability control BP . BP Control self-regulation measure also monitor collect throughout 12 week . BP control self-monitoring measure adherence recommend guideline monitor study . To measure BP control self-evaluation self-reinforcement , specific question ask end BP fluid log salt check list determine goal meet met appropriate self-reinforcement give . Pre HD BPs interdialytic weight gain ( IDWG ) collect weekly group 12 week . After 12 week BP Control Knowledge Test , BP Control Self-Efficacy Scale , PHQ-9 Morisky scale administer intervention control group . At 30 day post intervention , research coordinator collect average monthly BP fluid gain .</detailed_description>
