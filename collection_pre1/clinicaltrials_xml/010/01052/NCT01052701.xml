	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study With Ribavirin Abacavir Male Subjects With Hepatitis C Who Have Failed Ribavirin Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abacavir anti-HIV drug belongs class nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor . Ribavirin drug use treat hepatitis C infection . Both abacavir ribavirin approve Food Drug administration ( FDA ) . The dos abacavir ribavirin use study also FDA approved.Some individual HIV infection also hepatitis C. It possible may need take abacavir treat HIV ribavirin treat hepatitis C. Recent study suggest abacavir decrease level ribavirin body ( blood cell name peripheral blood mononuclear cell PBMCs ) . Thus , take ribavirin abacavir together could lead treatment failure hepatitis C. So important understand level ribavirin medication affect two medication take together .</detailed_description>
