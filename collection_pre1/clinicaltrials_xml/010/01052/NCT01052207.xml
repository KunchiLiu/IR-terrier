Potential significant alteration many thew body 's regulatory pathway may result severe oxidative stress . Further need delineate role oxidative stress may play</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assessing Oxidative Stress Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adrenal insufficiency ( AI ) common critically ill child adult . AI condition adrenal gland , locate kidney , make enough hormone body unable use hormone make . A hormone chemical help control different kind body function . The hormone study influence blood pressure fast heart beat . Doctors want know child need extra hormone critically ill . In pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) treat AI set standard order . By , show AI common many type sickness blood pressure improve extra hormone give . We also find people 's heart blood pressure always match level certain hormone , call cortisol , blood . Since cortisol level alone n't always show AI , child normal hormone level still benefit steroid , doctor look well understanding AI . Finding reason child develop AI may help doctor find way improve AI . One promising focus AI role oxidative stress ( OS ) . OS term use describe group chemical reaction involve oxygen . Emory 's adult intensive care unit show significant increase OS critically ill patient . Normally body 's cortisol act bind glucocorticoid ( class hormone ) receptor ( GR ) within cell . Many study show OS increase steroid resistance change GR structure function . Studies involve OS GR problem do child . We aim : 1 . Find many sick child OS PICU . 2 . Find normal OS level healthy child . 3 . Decide OS cause adrenal insufficiency .</detailed_description>
