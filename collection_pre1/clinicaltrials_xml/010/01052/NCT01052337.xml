	<brief_title>Anesthesia Induction Patients Undergoing Surgery Cervical Myelopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Fiberoptic intubation prefer method intubation patient acute symptom sign cervical myelopathy . This approach minimize cervical spine movement prevent new neurologic deficit neurologic injury , safe method secure airways patient foreseen difficult intubation . In patient anaesthesia induction aim prevent cervical spine movement maintain hemodynamic stability . The commonly report technique anaesthesia induction patient cervical myelopathy base local anaesthesia propofol administration . Aim trial compare propofol-based anaesthesia vs. sevoflurane-based anaesthesia induction patient cervical myelopathy receive oral nasal fiberoptic intubation . Methods : This randomize controlled trial design prove equivalence . A series 116 patient age 18 75 year , cervical myelopathy enrol . In patient topical anaesthesia accomplish anaesthesia induction . Patients randomly assign one two anaesthesia induction strategy ( sevoflurane + O2 + air propofol + O2 + air ) . When loss consciousness occur ( indicated Bispectral index value 40 50 ) , oral nasal fiberoptic intubation perform . The hemodynamic effect anaesthesia induction strategy assess measure mean arterial pressure 4 time point : anaesthesia induction ( T1 : baseline ) , end anaesthesia induction adequate sedation level , Bispectral index value 40-50 , achieve ( T2 : sedation steady state ) ; immediately placement endotracheal tube ( T3 : intubation ) ; five minute tracheal intubation ( T4 : post-intubation ) . Secondary end-points study include incidence apnoea induction process , diagnose absence carbon dioxide trace 10 second , incidence induction complication , define presence laryngospasm , cough patient movement , intubation condition , define cord opening . Discussion : We present development phase anaesthesiological trial . A total 40 patient enrol April 2009 .</detailed_description>
