	<brief_title>Status Growth Hormone/ Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 ( GH/IGF-1 ) Axis Growth Failure Ataxia Telangiectasia ( AT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth failure GH/IgF-1 deficiency describe patient diagnosed Ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) [ Boder et al.,1958 ] . This condition fatal inherit disease cause mutation ATM gene chromosome 11 lead chromosomal instability , immunodeficiency , cancer susceptibility endocrinological abnormality . In regard , several group demonstrate cross-linking ATM growth factor pathway . Participation ATM protein insulin signal phosphorylation eIF-4E-binding protein 1 postulate [ Yang et al.,2000 ] . Peretz et al . [ 2001 ] describe expression insulin-like growth factor-I receptor ( IGF-I R ) ATM dependent pathway regulate radiation response . In addition , Shahrabani-Gargir et al . [ 2004 ] find ATM gene control IGF-I R gene expression DNA damage response pathway . Suzuki et al . [ 2004 ] describe IGF-I phosphorylates AMPK-alpha , key regulator cholesterol fatty acid synthesis , act ATM-dependent manner . We recently demonstrate reduced level circulate Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) main bind protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) AT patient accompany decreased body mass index [ Schubert et al.,2005 ] . Furthermore , apart regulate somatic growth metabolism , evidence suggest GH/IGF-I axis involve regulation brain growth , development myelination . Moreover , GH particularly IGF-1 potential neuroprotective effect different vitro vivo experimental model . In addition recently show extracerebellar MRI-lesions AT go along deficiency GH/IGF-1 Axis , markedly reduce body weight , high ataxia score advance age [ Kieslich et al.,2009 ] . Supplementation growth hormone might overcome progressive dystrophy may clinical benefit progression neurodegeneration immunodeficiency . We find supplementation GH significantly increase longevity Atm-deficient mouse improve T-cell immunity locomotor behaviour [ Schubert et al.,2009 ] . Surprisingly IGF-1 generate ATM deficient mouse , indicate GH/IGF-1 signalling impaired . Taken account accurate diagnostic approach GH/IGF-1 axis mandatory include IGF-1 generation test long term treatment either GH IGF-1 justified human .</detailed_description>
