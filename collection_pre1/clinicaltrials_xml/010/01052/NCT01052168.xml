	<brief_summary>Emphasizing grow popularity motion metric majority available virtual reality simulator newer hybrid model offer motion track performance assessment . A popular hybrid model ( PROMIS ) allow train regular laparoscopic instrument box-trainer automatically record task duration movement efficiency ( pathlength smoothness ) immediately offer feedback trainee . Despite increase availability simulator track motion , knowledge impact metric trainee learn severely limited . We know important use speed , accuracy , motion efficiency combination thereof performance assessment metric impact skill transfer OR . Based sound educational principle develop proficiency-based laparoscopic suture simulator curriculum . This curriculum focus deliberate distribute practice , provide trainee augment feedback set expert-derived performance goal base time error . We previously demonstrate curriculum lead improved operative performance trainee compare control . To measure operative performance determine transferability , use live porcine Nissen fundoplication model . Instead place actual patient risk , porcine model preferable purpose offer objective metric ( target establish , distance measure , knot disrupt slippage scoring ) , complete standardization , allow multiple individual test day . We hypothesize proficiency-based simulator training laparoscopic suture expert-derived level speed motion result well operative performance compare participant train level speed motion alone . The study power detect least 10 % performance difference group . Specific Aims 1 . Compare whether performance difference group persist long-term 2 . Assess whether group demonstrate difference safety operate room compare inadvertent injury animal OR group 3 . Identify train duration require novice reach proficiency laparoscopic suture base speed , motion efficiency , combination metric 4 . Identify baseline participant characteristic may predict individual metric-specific performance</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : : We hypothesize train expert-derived level speed motion lead improve learning translate well operating room ( OR ) performance novice train goal speed motion alone . BACKGROUND : : Motion track suggest sensitive performance metric time error assessment surgical performance . METHODS : : An institutional review board-approved , single blind , randomize control trial conduct level-I American College Surgeons accredit Education Institute . Forty-two novice train proficiency laparoscopic suture randomize 3 group : The speed group ( n = 14 ) achieve expert level speed , motion group ( n = 15 ) expert level motion ( path length smoothness ) , speed motion group ( n = 13 ) level . To achieve proficiency , group also demonstrate error-free performance . The FLS suture module ( task 5 ) use train inside ProMIS simulator track instrument motion . All group participate transfer retention test OR . OR performance assess blind expert rater use Global Operative Assessment Laparoscopic Skills , speed , accuracy , inadvertent injury .</detailed_description>
