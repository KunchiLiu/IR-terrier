	<brief_summary>Following sudden unexpected emergence influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( 2009 H1N1 ) virus , observational study initiated estimate rate morbidity mortality examine predictor severity among participant 2009 H1N1 infection . In 2011 , surveillance indicate 2009 H1N1 virus co-circulating seasonal influenza A B viruses worldwide , protocol expand include influenza A subtypes influenza B virus . The current version protocol ( release August 2013 ) broaden scope observational study . With recognition novel respiratory virus novel influenza A virus , e.g. , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) , could become prevalent major public health importance , objectives protocol expand .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Study ( FLU 003 Plus )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose observational study describe characteristic outcomes 60-day follow-up period participant influenza virus infection ( include influenza A subtypes H3N2 2009 H1N1 , influenza B ) , target non-influenza respiratory virus , hospitalize severe illness and/or complication geographically diverse location . Specific objective related influenza virus infection estimate percentage participant go develop severe disease complication require hospitalization ; obtain information risk factor disease severity ; establish central repository specimen use virus characterization , include subtyping , antigenic genetic analysis , identification signature mutation associate antiviral drug resistance , mutational evolution , additional reassortment . Specific objective relate novel non-influenza respiratory viruses potential major public health importance characterize initial case outcome order develop specific protocol could inform prevention treatment new infection . The information use study participant influenza novel respiratory virus infection rapidly analyze share broadly order guide policymakers design future study . Approximately 500 patient influenza enrol year estimate 75 site geographically diverse location across several continent . Study Plan : - Participants meet eligibility criterion enrol participate clinical site . - Patients diagnosis influenza ( confirm suspect ) , hospitalize complication severe disease , enrol . - At enrollment , consent sign information ( demographic , medical history ( include prior influenza pneumococcal vaccination ) , medication ( include antiviral ) treatment prescribe ) record . A blood sample serum plasma obtain enrollment , well upper respiratory tract sample low respiratory tract sample , appropriate . The respiratory specimens sent central reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) test influenza . - For participant still hospitalize , intubate , 5 7 day enrollment additional upper respiratory sample obtain . - Status re-assessed approximately 28 day 60 day enrollment another blood sample serum plasma obtain time point . - For participant mechanically ventilate additional upper low respiratory tract specimen obtain specific timepoints . In February 2012 , FLU 004 Genomics protocol v 1.0 release field . In August 2013 , v 2.0 protocol release INSIGHT Genomics . The protocol expand beyond FLU 002 FLU 003 study include qualify INSIGHT study ( list qualify study post INSIGHT website , www.insight-trials.org ) . The purpose substudy obtain whole blood sample DNA extract study polymorphism immune response gene genetic variant may associate increase risk severe influenza . Participating FLU 003 Plus site give option also participate INSIGHT Genomics require separate protocol registration . Participants , consent FLU 003 Plus , offer option also consent INSIGHT Genomics include single whole blood sample collection . Participation FLU 003 Plus compromise participant opts participate INSIGHT Genomics .</detailed_description>
