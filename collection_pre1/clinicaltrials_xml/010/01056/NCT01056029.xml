	<detailed_description>Pro-drug chemotherapy approach cancer treatment investigate mean achieve high concentration cytotoxic biologically active agent tumor location avoid systemic toxicity . With pro-drug chemotherapy , relatively non-toxic form cytotoxin , pro-drug , convert active cytotoxic agent tumor site specific location . G-202 ( mipsagargin ) thapsigargin pro-drug ; consist cytotoxic analog thapsigargin couple mask peptide inhibits biologic activity proteolytic cleavage tumor site . Thapsigargin natural product profound effect cell viability . Thapsigargin non-cell-type specific toxin document ability kill broad spectrum cancer cell line well normal endothelial cell , fibroblast osteoblast . It induce rapid pronounced increase concentration cytosolic calcium , due blockade Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase ( SERCA ) pump bind high affinity . The increase cytosolic calcium lead induction apoptosis ensue cell death . The anti-tumor effect G-202 human advance solid tumor yet know .</detailed_description>
