	<detailed_description>Background : Preterm birth ( PTB ) associate 75 % morbidity neonate . Although mortality morbidity high child early PTB ( &lt; 32 week ' gestation ) , late PTB ( 34 36 week gestation ) common create serious impact public health . Indeed , late PTBs constitute 74 % PTBs , even modest increase rate late PTB dramatic effect health care cost . PTB rate rise across Canada Alberta even faster rate : 1996 2005 , rate PTB Alberta increase 23 % . Late PTBs account majority increase . While clear early PTB small gestational age ( GA ) risk factor later developmental challenge even adulthood , risk negative effect late PTB child development emerge . In spite evidence heavy weight ( usually old gestation ) infants benefit early intervention light weight counterpart , late preterm infant ineligible early intervention program unless health problem . Most program design mother , yet father contribute child 's development providing interaction vigorous , stimulating , state-disruptive mother . Given increase risk delay , important mother father late preterm infant skilled parent-child interaction support development . A new intervention father use positive individualized feedback parent-child interaction show promise improve interaction healthy infant . However , unknown whether intervention effective father late preterm infant . The purpose study test educational intervention first-time father late preterm ( 34 36 week gestation ) infant . Hypothesis : Compared comparison group , first-time father late preterm infant receive educational intervention positive father-infant interaction infant 8 month old ( adjusted age account prematurity ) measure structure play use Parent Child Interaction Teaching Scale ( PCITS ) ( also know Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale [ NCATS ] ) score raters blind group assignment . Secondary Research Question : What effect intervention father ' perception parent stress measure Parenting Stress Index ( PSI ) 4 8 month adjust age ? Method : In pilot randomize control trial , data collect 148 English speaking , first time father healthy , late preterm , singleton infant . Fathers intervention group receive two home visit infant 4 6 month old ( adjusted age ) one web-based booster session . Fathers comparison group receive home visit discuss list age appropriate toy . For father , baseline interaction parent stress measure 4 month outcomes 8 month . Measures : The PCITS observational measure use measure change father-child interaction intervention include Parent Domain score compose sensitivity cue , response distress , cognitive growth fostering , socio-emotional growth fostering . The PSI self-report instrument provide Parent Domain score reflect parent 's experience stress parent . The Child Domain score reflect parental perception child 's temperament behaviour . All measure establish reliability validity inter-rater reliability assess . Analyses : The socio-demographic baseline variable compare study group use descriptive statistic ( mean median appropriate , standard deviation interquartile range appropriate , proportion ) . Correlations use determine relationship dependent variable ( interaction ) know confounders may need use covariates . To test primary hypothesis difference exist group father-infant interaction linear model adjust covariates use . The approach use test overall treatment effect parent stress Parent Child Domains . We include subgroup analysis test interaction effect baseline variable group , father use web-based booster . Significance : The result help design educational intervention mitigate risk , optimize developmental outcome late preterm infant enhance father ' interaction child , complement effect mother ' contribution child 's development .</detailed_description>
