	<brief_summary>In present study investigator measure effect nicotine non-nicotine factor brain function cognitive process differentially sensitive factor . One process—continuous work memory ( CWM ) —is implement via network frontal parietal brain region highly dopamine dependent . Smoking cessation result significant deficit CWM persist week reverse resumption nicotine administration form smoke nicotine replacement . Additionally , CWM deficits observe smoke denic cigarette . Brain function CWM modulate smoke abstinence subsequent nicotine administration activity dlPFC implicated effect . Collectively , data suggest CWM highly sensitive nicotine , non-nicotine component smoke . Brain function CWM alter smoke abstinence nicotine , effect smoking , absence nicotine , evaluate . Another process—cue-reactivity ( CR ) —results repeat pair otherwise neutral stimulus nicotine administration . Acute smoke cessation show strong effect CR form cue-provoked craving , nicotine replacement show robust effect CR . Likewise , direct effect smoke abstinence brain CR small ; though crave show modulate relation abstinence CR . Moreover , recent data lab suggest large 'doses ' abstinence ( ~ 24 hr ) may amplify brain response cue . The effect smoke absence nicotine , CR , knowledge , evaluate . Collectively , data suggest CR form cue-induced craving highly sensitive effect short-term smoking abstinence nicotine . Brain CR modulate abstinence-induced crave longer-term abstinence , unclear whether abstinence nicotine non-nicotine component responsible effect . In present study , propose evaluate effect non-nicotine nicotine factor CWM CR use functional magnetic resonance imaging . This method allow non-invasive assessment brain function . We also examine role gene moderate mediate effect nicotine non-nicotine factor cognitive function</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview . In fully factorial design , thirty-six ( n=36 ) adult smoker undergo fMRI scan least 24 hour follow condition : 1 ) Nicotine Patch + Denic Smoking , 2 ) Placebo Patch + Denic Smoking , 3 ) Nicotine Patch + No Smoking , 4 ) Placebo Patch+ No Smoking . During scan , participant complete laboratory base measure continuous work memory ( n-back ) —a measure continuous work memory—and cue-reactivity task ( CR ) —a measure response smoke cue . Broadly , hypothesize 1 ) abstinence nicotine , regardless smoking , disrupt CWM performance brain function , 2 ) abstinence nicotine denics potentiate brain CR differentially contribute effect 3 ) individual difference smoke behavior motivation predict effect nicotine non-nicotine factor brain function .</detailed_description>
