	<brief_title>Treatment With Ribavirin Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overexpression eIF4E occur great 50 % BC , associate clinical progression , angiogenesis chemoresistance . eIF4E protein expression elevate stroma benign tissue . A major focus future management BC develop novel targeted therapeutic , associate biomarkers clinical value . It possible target central regulator control multiple pathway might effective target single downstream molecule . In preclinical study , demonstrate ribavirin inhibits proliferation BC cell line clinically achievable concentration inhibit target , eIF4E . This trial address important clinical issue lack treatment poor prognosis BC , characterize overexpression eIF4E . We explore use eIF4E therapeutic target predictive marker . We determine whether target eIF4E ribavirin , commercially approve , inexpensive , oral therapeutic compound favourable toxicity profile , may present novel treatment option patient aggressive , metastatic disease .</detailed_description>
