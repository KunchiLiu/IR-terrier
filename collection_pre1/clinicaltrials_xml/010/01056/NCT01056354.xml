	<brief_summary>Following sudden unexpected emergence influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( 2009 H1N1 ) virus , observational study initiate describe participant seek medical care geographically diverse location 2009 H1N1 infection clinical course 14-day period follow enrollment . In 2011 , surveillance indicate 2009 H1N1 virus co-circulating seasonal influenza A B viruses worldwide , protocol expand include influenza A subtypes influenza B viruses . This version protocol broaden scope observational study . With recognition novel respiratory virus novel influenza A virus , e.g. , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) , could become prevalent major public health importance , objectives protocol expand</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Virus Outpatient Study ( FLU 002 Plus )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose observational study describe participant geographically diverse location influenza virus infection viral respiratory diseases public health importance clinical course 14-day period follow enrollment . Specific objective related influenza virus infection estimate percentage participant go develop severe disease complication require hospitalization ; obtain information risk factor disease severity ; establish central repository specimen use virus characterization , include subtyping , antigenic genetic analysis , identification signature mutation associate antiviral drug resistance , mutational evolution , additional reassortment . Specific objective relate novel non-influenza respiratory viruses potential major public health importance characterize initial case outcome order develop specific protocol could inform prevention treatment new infection Sample size open-ended observational study . Based experience date , estimate 75 site participate enroll approximately 1,700 patient influenza year , one-half Northern Hemisphere one-half Southern Hemisphere . Sites diverse geographic location several continent participate . Study Plan : - Participants meet eligibility criterion enrol participate clinical site . - At enrollment , consent sign information ( demographic , medical history ( include prior influenza pneumococcal vaccination ) , medication ( include antiviral ) treatment prescribe record . A blood sample serum plasma obtain enrollment , well upper respiratory tract specimen . The respiratory specimen send central reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) test influenza . - Status re-assessed approximately 14 day enrollment another blood sample serum plasma obtain . For participant confirm novel respiratory virus public health importance , attempt make obtain sample local specimen use diagnose infection . In February 2012 , FLU 004 Genomics protocol v 1.0 release field . In August 2013 v 2.0 protocol release INSIGHT Genomics . The protocol expand beyond FLU 002 FLU 003 study include qualify INSIGHT study ( list post INSIGHT website , www.insight-trials.org . The purpose substudy obtain whole blood sample DNA extract study polymorphism immune response gene genetic variant may associate increase risk disease progression among individual infectious disease public health importance enrol qualify INSIGHT study . Participating FLU 002 Plus site give option also participate INSIGHT Genomics , require separate protocol registration . Participants , consent FLU 002 Plus , offer option also consent INSIGHT Genomics , include single whole blood sample collection . Participation FLU 002 Plus compromise participant opts participate INSIGHT Genomics .</detailed_description>
