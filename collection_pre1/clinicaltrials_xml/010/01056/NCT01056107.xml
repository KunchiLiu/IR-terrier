	<brief_summary>This trial study effect investigational ( FDA approve ) medication , ROSE-010 , movement food stomach , small intestine colon female constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( C-IBS ) . The study hypothesis ROSE-010 delay gastric empty solid enhances gastric accommodation without retard colonic transit female patient C-IBS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects ROSE-010 GI Transit Constipation Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( C-IBS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology Female patient C-IBS screen eligibility inform study initial screen visit Visit 1 . Within two week Visit 1 , eligible patient randomize study medication , either 30 mcg , 100 mcg 300 mcg ROSE-010 placebo administer via abdominal subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection total four day , three consecutive day transit scintigraphy prior SPECT imaging . The allocation treatment group conceal . Study medication administer Visits 2 , 3 , 4 , day scintigraphic assessment gastric , small bowel colonic transit solid perform 48 hour period . Within two seven day Visit 4 , patient instruct return administration final injection study medication follow SPECT gastric accommodation measurement ( Visit 5 ) . Within seven ten day Visit 5 , patient return Visit 6 , final safety monitoring exit interview study staff . Investigational product , dosage mode administration Patients receive placebo 30 mcg , 100 mcg 300 mcg ROSE-010 administer s.c. abdomen Visit 2 , immediately standardize breakfast meal , fifteen minute first camera image obtain . Study medication administer fifteen minute camera image obtain Visits 3 4 . Study medication administer immediately first fast scan obtain second fasting scan SPECT Visit 5 . Duration treatment ROSE-010 matching placebo administer via abdominal s.c injection daily three consecutive day one final day two seven day later , ten-day interval . Duration patient involvement study Each patient attend six visit clinic period two four week . Efficacy assessments 1 . Scintigraphic gastrointestinal colonic transit 2 . Technetium-99m ( 99mTc ) SPECT measurement gastric volume 3 . Assessment stool frequency consistency make patient use Bowel Pattern Diary Safety assessments The following safety assessment perform : 1 . Laboratory safety test , include complete blood count ( CBC ) , comprehensive metabolic panel ( CMP ) , urinalysis ( UA ) Visit 1 ( study entry ) Visit 6 ( study exit ) 2 . A physical examination study physician Visit 1 3 . Weight vital sign ( include temperature , pulse , blood pressure respiration rate ) every visit 4 . Urine pregnancy test perform Visit 1 within 48 hour prior receipt radiation Visit 2 transit test Visit 5 SPECT test 5 . Interview concomitant medication adverse event every visit Statistical method An analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) use compare transit parameter gastric volume among treatment group . If necessary suitable transformation potential skewness distribution measure volume may use ( e.g. , ANCOVA rank log volume ) . If ANCOVA show p value le equal 0.10 , 100 mcg 300 mcg dos compare placebo ( p value less equal 0.25 ) . Dunnett 's Test use compare dose group placebo . Since primary endpoint assess separate hypothesis regard effect ROSE-010 , adjustment alpha level test multiple type endpoint anticipate , two-sided significance level 0.05 use ANCOVA model . Analysis data set The primary analysis follow intent treat ( ITT ) paradigm patient randomize included analysis . Those patient miss response value miss value impute via overall ( patient non-missing data ) mean correspond adjustment ANCOVA residual error variance degree freedom ( subtract one miss value impute ) . Safety data present patient receive investigational product .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Female aged 1865 year old inclusive . 2 . A previous diagnosis IBS accord Rome III criterion include patient recurrent abdominal pain discomfort least six month prior diagnosis currently least three day per month last three month associate two follow : 1. improvement defecation 2. onset associate change frequency stool 3. onset associate change form ( appearance ) stool . 3 . Constipation predominant type IBS define one following : 1. few three spontaneous complete bowel movement per week 2. hard lumpy stool 25 % time 3. strain bowel movement 25 % time . 4 . A normal rectal exam result file within past two year perform screen exclude possibility evacuation disorder . Examination must exclude finding suggestive evacuation disorder high sphincter tone rest , failure perineal descent one centimeter strain last , spasm , tenderness paradoxical contraction puborectalis muscle . 5 . Females child bear potential ( experienced bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy menopause ) must use acceptable method contraception study . Acceptable method surgical sterilization , hormonal method oral contraceptive , Norplant DepoProvera , double barrier method condom spermicide , intrauterine device ( IUD ) . Abstinent female may participate agree use double barrier method become sexually active study . 6 . Able provide write informed consent prior study procedure perform . 1 . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . 2 . Structural metabolic diseases/conditions affect gastrointestinal system , functional gastrointestinal disorder CIBS . 3 . Unable withdraw medication 48 hour prior study : medication alters GI transit include limited laxative , magnesium aluminumcontaining antacid , prokinetics , erythromycin , narcotic , anticholinergic , tricyclic antidepressant serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRIs ) ; analgesic drug include opiate , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , COX 2 inhibitor ( Note : Tylenol permit ) , GABAergic agents benzodiazepine . Note : All concomitant medication review case case basis study physician . 4 . Clinical evidence ( include limit clinically significant abnormal physical exam , ECG laboratory result past medical record ) current clinically significant abnormal physical exam laboratory test result could indicate significant cardiovascular , respiratory , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , hematological , neurological , psychiatric , disease interfere objective study . If laboratory test result abnormal clinically significant , may repeat discretion PI . If laboratory test result remain abnormal clinically significant , patient refer primary care physician evaluation . 5 . Patients consider Investigator alcoholic remission know substance abuser . 6 . Patients participate another clinical study within past 30 day .</criteria>
