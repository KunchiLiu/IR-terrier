	<brief_title>Effect Fish-oil Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes fatty acid ( FA ) composition within liver may influence lipid metabolism inflammation . This poorly understood human . Especially omega-3 FA important : They promote FA oxidation storage important export lipid liver . Omega-3 FA also anti-inflammatory property . Changes liver FA composition may influence dietary intake , high rate lipid peroxidation ( LP ) low delta-6 desaturase enzyme activity . We others recently show NASH patient lower hepatic n-3 n-6 polyunsaturated FA ( PUFA ) increase lipid peroxidation low antioxidant status compare patient minimal finding liver biopsy . The dietary intake FA similar among 3 group suggest difference hepatic FA composition may relate high lipid peroxidation low delta-6 desaturase activity . This difference hepatic FA composition may significance pathogenesis NASH since may change gene expression regard lipid metabolism . This pilot study NASH ass effect n-3 PUFA supplementation FA composition ( liver red blood cell ) , hepatic gene expression , histology . We also assess ratio phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) liver red blood cell ( RBC ) . Oxidative stress , insulin resistance nutritional measurement perform characterize patient . New research suggest composition gut flora ( intestinal microbiota ) may play role development NASH . The effect fish oil intestinal microbiota examine human . Therefore , intestinal microbiota also measure intervention association change microbiota change liver histology examine . In addition , bacterial product ( short chain fatty acid stool , lipopolysaccharide plasma , bacterial DNA plasma ) , plasma choline measure . An environmental questionnaire capture factor influence intestinal microbiota .</detailed_description>
