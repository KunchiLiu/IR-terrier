	<brief_summary>The male sex-hormone call testosterone know play key role growth prostate cancer . The usual treatment disease involve suppression hormone ( testosterone ) anti-hormonal treatment unknown period time cancer progress . This anti-hormonal treatment usually consist injection every three month LHRH ( Leutinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone ) agonist short course anti-androgen pill , together help lower production testosterone . Long-term hormonal treatment potentially serious side effect expensive . In study , hormonal treatment hold patient eligible willing participate . The aim study see decrease amount hormone injection patient require . This might lead decreased side effect ( decrease bone health , cardiovascular problem metabolic syndrome occur several health condition happen time lead increase risk heart disease , stroke diabetes ) well decrease cost hormonal therapy treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most men respond initial ADT fall serum PSA improvement symptom , present initially ; median duration response 1.5 - 2 year , highly variable . Increase serum PSA despite castrate testosterone level signifies disease become castration resistant . Some patient may short period response hormonal manipulation add peripheral antiandrogen bicalutamide , later withdraw . Other hormonal manipulation may try sequentially chemotherapy vary success : tertiary hormonal manipulation may include glucocorticoid prednisone dexamethasone , ketoconazole hydrocortisione , estrogens DES , alternative anti-androgens flutamide nilutamide . In institution , policy continue LHRH agonist indefinitely . Despite proven role prostate cancer treatment , ADT multiple toxicity include osteopenia/osteoporosis , potentially lethal metabolic syndrome cardiovascular complication . Also , continuous long term LHRH injection expensive . In study , propose prospective cohort study Princess Margaret Hospital answer follow important question regard tertiary hormonal manipulation : 1 . What relationship serum testosterone time stop LHRH agonist men receive chronic LHRH therapy ≥ 1 year ? 2 . What clinical factor influence recovery testosterone ? 3 . What save cost achieve dose LHRH agonist basis measurement testosterone compare routine 3-monthly injection ?</detailed_description>
