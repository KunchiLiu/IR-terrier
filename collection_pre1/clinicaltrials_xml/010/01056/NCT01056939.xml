	<brief_summary>The purpose study find NAVA-technology well detect patient inspiratory effort mechanical ventilation currently use flow-triggering PRVC ( pressure regulate volume control ) ventilation , NAVA give real benefit patient . The investigator study hypothesis NAVA-technology detect spontaneous inspiration accurately currently use method , thus lead smooth adaptation mechanical ventilation pediatric patient . The investigator expect decrease time ventilatory support need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist ( NAVA ) Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asynchrony mean time support give ventilator different patient breathe pattern . Asynchrony ventilatory care may increase risk complication , make wean difficult may affect survival rate . In study randomly treat pediatric patient need ventilatory support neurally adjust ventilatory assist pressure control PRVC-ventilation . We willing find special benefit patient treatment mode .</detailed_description>
