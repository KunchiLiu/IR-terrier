	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Combination Bendamustine , Bortezomib Dexamethasone ( BBD ) First-Line Treatment Patients With Multiple Myeloma Who Are Not Candidates High Dose Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study ass efficacy , tolerability , toxicity bendamustine , bortezomib , dexamethasone ( BBD ) first-line treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient transplant ineligible candidate high dose chemotherapy . Eligible patient receive protocol treatment 34 week plus screening period ( 2 week ) . Response assessment occur every 4 week confirm use International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria . Patients objective response stable disease continue maintenance therapy disease progression intolerable toxicity .</detailed_description>
