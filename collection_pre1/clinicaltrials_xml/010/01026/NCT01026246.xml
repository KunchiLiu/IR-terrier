	<brief_summary>Malaria cause germ people get bite mosquito . It kill 2 million people year . Many drug use treat malaria work well used researcher explore vaccine prevent malaria . The purpose study learn vaccine , call EBA-175 RII-NG , safe strengthen body 's defense malaria . Participants include 60 healthy adult , age 18-40 , recruited Accra , Ghana . Several dosage vaccine test safety . The low dosage vaccine test next high dose test . There two group dose , one group receive vaccine group receive placebo ( salt water solution ) . Participants may involve study related procedure 398 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria account 500 million febrile illness million death annually . The disease burden heavy economically develop country estimate 5 percent gross domestic product sub-Saharan country consume direct indirect health cost malaria . Researchers propose conduct Phase I dosage-escalating study assess safety immunogenicity 3 different dosage erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 kDA region II-nonglycosylated ( EBA-175 RII-NG ) recombinant Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) vaccine adjuvanted Adju-Phos ( aluminum phosphate adjuvant ) : 5 , 20 , 80 microgram ( mcg ) , give 3 dos 0 , 1 , 6 month intramuscular ( IM ) injection healthy young adult malaria endemic area ( semi-immune adult ) . One dose vaccine give time point . The primary objective ass safety reactogenicity ( tolerability ) ascend dosage EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine among healthy subject give 3 IM dos 0 , 1 6 month . The secondary objective evaluate immunogenicity EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine measure anti-EBA-175 RII-NG antibody use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , inhibition Plasmodium falciparum growth vitro , inhibition bind EBA-175 RII-NG red blood cell ( RBCs ) . Participants include 60 malaria semi-immune healthy subject age 18 40 year , male female , recruit Accra , Ghana . Subjects randomize receive 3 dos vaccine saline placebo intramuscular route 9:1 ratio 0 , 1 6 month . The safety immunogenicity ascend dosage vaccine assess . Eighteen subject receive vaccine follow dosage level : 5 , 20 , 80 mcg . Two subject receive placebo dosage level . Dosage escalation proceed review 2-week safety data 2 initial dos prior dosage level .</detailed_description>

Females childbearing potential must agree practice adequate contraception study 3 month third vaccination ( include abstinence ; hormonal contraception ; condom spermicidal agent ) ; male female partner childbearing age must agree use condom birth control . Good health determine screen medical history , physical examination ( PE ) , routine laboratory assessment . Willingness comply protocol requirement . Ability provide inform consent protocol procedure perform . Availability followup 12 month first immunization dose . Regular use medication vitamins contraceptive . Current recent ( within last 4 week prior vaccination ) treatment parenteral , inhaled , oral corticosteroid ( intranasal steroid acceptable ) , immunosuppressive agent , chemotherapy . History splenectomy . Abnormal screen laboratory value . Any abnormal screening value screen test , exclude subject study . An exception rule glucose measurement . Random plasma glucose measure subject screen visit . Values high 110 mg/dl confirm repeat fast glucose measurement . History current medical , occupational , social family problem result alcohol illicit drug use volunteer . History moderate severe mental illness , define symptom interfere social occupational function suicidal thoughts/attempts . History receive blood blood product ( blood transfusion , platelet transfusion , immunoglobulin , hyperimmune serum ) previous 6 month . Vaccination live vaccine within past 30 day nonreplicating , inactivate , subunit vaccine within last 14 day . Known hypersensitivity component vaccine [ ErythrocyteBinding Antigen 175 kDa Region IINonglycosylated ( EBA175 RIING ) , sucrose , aluminum adjuvant ] . History acute chronic medical condition include , limited , disorder liver , kidney , lung , heart , nervous system , metabolic autoimmune/inflammatory condition , sickle cell disease . History anaphylaxis severe hypersensitivity reaction . Severe asthma , define emergency room visit hospitalization within last 12 month . Pregnant breastfeed woman , woman unwilling use effective contraception study period . Acute illness , include temperature &gt; 37.8 degree Celsius within one week prior vaccination . Positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Concurrent participation investigational protocol receipt investigational product within previous 30 day . Identification condition , opinion investigator , would affect ability subject understand comply study protocol would jeopardize safety right subject participate study . History malignancy , include hematologic skin cancer , know immunodeficiency syndrome . Premedication analgesic antipyretic 6 hour prior vaccination , plan medication analgesic antipyretic 24 hour follow vaccination . This criterion preclude subject receive medication vaccination need arises .</criteria>
