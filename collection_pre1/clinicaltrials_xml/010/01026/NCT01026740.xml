	<brief_summary>The primary objective study measure penetration ceftobiprole subcutaneous ( s.c. ) adipose tissue skeletal muscle determine concentration time ceftobiprole tissue plasma administration single intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion ( directly vein ) ceftobiprole 500 mg administer 2 hour . The secondary objective ass safety tolerability ceftobiprole single i.v . infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Penetration Ceftobiprole Into Soft Tissue Determined Microdialysis Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label ( patient involve know identity drug ) , single-arm , nonrandomized study ceftobiprole healthy men woman . The study conduct 2 part : pilot study main study . Each study ( i.e . pilot study main study ) consist 3 phase : pretreatment phase include 21-day screening period , open-label treatment phase ( 1 day pilot study 2 day main study ) , posttreatment phase include end study evaluation follow-up study visit telephone contact plan 1 2 week discharge study unit . Serial blood dialysis sample collect specified time point predose 24 hour start infusion estimation ceftobiprole ceftobiprole medocaril concentration . Additional sample collect measurement protein binding . The study include follow evaluation safety tolerability : adverse event , clinical laboratory test ( include hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign , physical examination , serology , pregnancy test , urine drug screen , alcohol breath test . In pilot study , Ceftobiprole locally administer via microdialysis probe concentration approximately 30 µg/mL 60 minute . In main Study , volunteer receive ceftobiprole locally via microdialysis probe . After washout period determine pilot study , volunteer receive single 2-hour i.v . infusion ceftobiprole .</detailed_description>
