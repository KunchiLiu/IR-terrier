	<brief_summary>It know least 20 year hemodynamic data , amount exercise perform well symptom treadmill , significant value perfusion stress test . When pharmacologic stress test perform ( adenosine stress test 4-6 minute ) , hemodynamic data lost . Because loss valuable data , felt also loss significant prognostic data well . With advent FDA release Regadenoson rapid injection form ( 10 second ) , think combination exercise stress test pharmacologic test subject achieve 85 % maximal predict heart rate may viable stress test option . The purpose study look use drug , regadenoson , exercise stress testing ; side effect symptom may experience individual subject use combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maximal Bruce Protocol With Use Regadenoson For Myocardial Perfusion Stress Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A nuclear stress test recommend patient doctor . This test help detect significant blockage artery heart . The test involve patient walk treadmill heart rate reach 85 % age-determined maximal predict heart rate . If patient need stop walking reason ( tiredness , chest pain , shortness breath dizziness ) prior reach 85 % maximal heart rate , test becomes inaccurate blockage miss . Nonetheless , information gain patient walking remain valuable . If subject reach 85 % , usual procedure re-do test subject would walk treadmill , would inject pharmacologic agent ( drug ) dilate blood vessel . This would allow u obtain accurate picture blockages blood vessel . By `` drug '' test alone , lose important information gain treadmill test . In present study subject ask walk treadmill near end walk , reach 85 % , `` drug '' give patient . Regadenoson FDA approve drug stress test . Regadenoson ( versus one pharmacological agent ) give dose 400 mcg , infuse 10 - 20 second follow standard flushing solution , infusion radiotracer ( FDA approve method administration ) give nuclear imaging . The entire intravenous procedure take 30 second . The subject undergo 5 minute standard observation/monitoring post infusion administration . Standard nuclear stress image follow . By , obtain important information exercise portion test maintain accuracy detect blockage . By study manner , able save subject time obtain information heart either test individually .</detailed_description>
