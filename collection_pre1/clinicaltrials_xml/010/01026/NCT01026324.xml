	<brief_title>Dinaciclib Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase 2 dose SCH727965 administer 4-hour infusion every week patient advance malignant melanoma . ( Phase I ) II . To determine 1-year overall survival patient malignant melanoma treat SCH727965 dose schedule derive phase 1 part study . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety profile toxicity SCH727965 administer 4-hour infusion every week . II . To determine pharmacokinetics SCH727965 administer 4-hour infusion every week . III . To determine proportion patient malignant melanoma alive without progression disease 6 month begin treatment SCH727965 dose schedule derive phase 1 part study . IV . To determine objective response rate SCH727965 patient malignant melanoma enrol part 2 study . V. To document cdk2 , combine cdk2/1 cdk9 inhibition surrogate tissue tumor . VI . To correlate degree change pharmacodynamic parameter post-treatment compare pre-treatment sample clinical outcome . VII . To correlate degree change parameter define cdk2 , cdk2/1 cdk9 inhibition pharmacokinetic parameter . VIII . To correlate pre-treatment cdk2 level degree change parameter measure cdk2 inhibition . IX . To correlate pre-treatment cdk2 level clinical outcome . X . To correlate tumor p53 status clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive dinaciclib IV 4 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
