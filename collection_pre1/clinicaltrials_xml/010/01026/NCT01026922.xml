	<brief_summary>This study test new medical device call SmartPill GI Monitoring System , use diagnose gastric motility disorder adult , child . The study compare SmartPill capsule finding antroduodenal manometry ( ADM ) , standard procedure currently use evaluation gastric duodenal motility child . The ADM study do clinical purpose recommend patient 's gastroenterologist . The research portion study limit use SmartPill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Ambulatory Capsule Characterize Gastrointestinal Pressure Patterns Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADM standard procedure use child , limitation disadvantage . Manometry study involve place catheter nose often poorly tolerated child . Also , placement catheter require sedation anesthesia , manometry test last several hour involve ingestion meal many child find difficult catheter nose . The reason conducting study would like find new , less invasive , equally informative test understand gastrointestinal motility . The SmartPill GI Monitoring System use capsule , size large vitamin PillCam capsule , swallow pass stool . While GI tract , capsule measure acidity ( pH ) pressure , measurement use determine long take food leave stomach . Pressure pH information send capsule receiver patient either wear belt keep within 2 foot . The receiver store data collect pH , temperature , pressure inside GI tract . The SmartPill GI Monitoring System already approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use adults child .</detailed_description>
