	<brief_title>Cantharidin-induced Skin Blister Testing Anti-inflammatory Effects Macrolides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 3 part . Part A study assess feasibility different cantharidin blister induction/sampling timepoints ( challenge option ) range 16/16 hour 48/48 hour , include ability evaluate acute resolve phase acute inflammation . In Part A , 4 8 healthy male volunteer include . This follow Part B ( 12 subject ) , aim select optimum challenge option base reproducibility read-outs across two challenge session . This option apply Part C 24 subject order evaluate utility assay demonstrate anti-inflammatory effect standard macrolide ( azithromycin ) . Part C design double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group trial . Following first cantharidin challenge blister evaluation , subject randomise 1:1 ratio receive azithromycin placebo . Skin blister induction assessment repeat immediately treatment completion , potentially , approximately 3 week later . The inflammatory response cantharidin modulation azithromycin evaluate total differential cell count blister fluid , monocyte/macrophage phenotyping measurement select inflammation mediator blister fluid serum .</detailed_description>

Presence either forearm tattoo , naevi , scar , keloid , hyperpigmentation , excessive hair skin abnormality may , opinion investigator , interfere study assessment . Subjects history keloid , skin allergy , hypersensitivity contact dermatitis , include previous reaction dressing use study . Subjects history lymphangitis and/or lymphoedema . Subjects history HIV infection , hepatitis B C. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include ergot derivative e.g . dihydroergotamine ( Dihydergot ) , vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within whichever long period 14 day 5 halflives ( know ) prior first challenge day , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior dose day current study : 90 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56day period . For part C : QTcB QTcF &gt; 450 msec , base average QTc value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period , first measurement show abnormal QTc value . History sensitivity azithromycin , macrolide/ketolide antibiotic component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation .</criteria>
