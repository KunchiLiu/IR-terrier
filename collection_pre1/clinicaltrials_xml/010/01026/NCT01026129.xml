	<brief_summary>This study design compare effect bolus dose remifentanil bolus dose lidocaine give prior emergence anesthesia : - incidence perioperative cough - time need emergence desflurane-based anesthesia - incidence sore throat extubation . Our hypothesis use remifentanil bolus dose give prior emergence desflurane-based anesthesia reduce incidence perioperative cough 70 % 35 % compare lidocaine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Remifentanil Compared Lidocaine Incidence Coughing During Emergence Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence important period general anesthesia several problem occur . Coughing , hypertension , tachycardia agitation observe emergence general anesthesia . Most patient cough emergence . Different technique drug study reduce cough emergence . Among others , role lidocaine give intravenously , topically , intra-cuff study . There evidence support administration intravenous opioids prior emergence general anesthesia reduce perioperative coughing , agitation haemodynamic stimulation . However , depend type opioids give , may delay emergence anesthesia . The effect remifentanil infusion give combination isoflurane volatile agent show reduce incidence perioperative coughing without delay emergence anesthesia . The effect small bolus remifentanil give prior emergence prevent perioperative coughing yet study . Desflurane newer volatile agent allow early recovery anesthesia . This agent lead early discharge rapid resumption normal activity surgery . However , incidence cough around 70 % report desflurane-based anesthesia . This study compare effect remifentanil ( bolus dose 0.25 mcg/kg 0.5 mcg/kg ) lidocaine ( bolus dose 1mg/kg ) give prior emergence prevent perioperative cough desflurane-based anesthesia . Methods : - Induction general anesthesia : 1.5-3 mg/kg propofol 1-3 mcg/kg fentanyl . Neuromuscular relaxation discretion attend anesthesiologist . - Tracheal intubation use direct laryngoscopy . - Maintenance general anesthesia : desflurane 0.7 1.0 MAC , fentanyl 1 mcg/kg . Neuromuscular relaxation carry discretion attend anesthesiologist . - No opioids give last 30 minute surgery . - Reversal neuromuscular blockade mandatory end surgery . - At end surgery : discontinuation desflurane . - Administration study drug : ( bolus dose remifentanil 0.25 mcg/kg , remifentanil 0.5 mcg/kg lidocaine 1 mg/kg ) . - When expire fraction desflurane reach 0.2 MAC , patient ask open eye every 30 second . - After eye open , ventilator stop extubation perform . - Number cough episode importance rat scale 0 3 blind observer emergence first ten minute extubation . - Time elapsed administration bolus dose study drug extubation record . - The presence sore throat assess one hour extubation .</detailed_description>
