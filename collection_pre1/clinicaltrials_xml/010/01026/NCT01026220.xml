	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study well give combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy work treat young patient newly diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To maintain overall survival ( define 4-year `` second-event '' free survival ) subject high risk Hodgkin lymphoma 95 % . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To maintain 3-year event-free survival subject high risk Hodgkin lymphoma 93 % . II . To maintain comparable overall survival ( define 4-year `` second-event '' free survival ) subject high risk Hodgkin lymphoma rapid slow response initial 2 cycle ABVE-PC* intensify therapy addition 2 cycle ifosfamide/vinorelbine slow early response . III . To investigate whether early response assessment measure FDG-PET 1 cycle chemotherapy identifies subject cohort study future trial distinguishable currently define RER 2 cycle . IV . To describe pattern relapse ABVE-PC* risk-adapted radiotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . INDUCTION THERAPY ( ABVE-PC ) : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 1-120 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1 2 , bleomycin sulfate IV least 10 minute subcutaneously ( SC ) vincristine sulfate IV day 1 8 , etoposide phosphate IV 1-2 hour day 1-3 , oral prednisone twice daily day 1-7 , filgrastim* SC IV daily begin day 4 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . NOTE : *Patients receive filgrastim day 8 . Patients undergo clinical restaging response assessment 2 course induction therapy . Patients rapid early response ( RER ) slow early response ( SER ) proceed consolidation therapy . Patients progressive disease go study . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients assign 1 2 consolidation therapy regimen base response induction therapy . Patients develop progressive disease induction take protocol therapy . REGIMEN I ( RER ) : Patients receive 2 course ABVE-PC absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . REGIMEN II ( SER ) : Patients receive ifosfamide IV continuously day 1-4 , vinorelbine ditartrate IV 6-30 minute day 1 5 , filgrastim SC IV daily begin day 6 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients receive 2 course ABVE-PC absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients continue response completion consolidation therapy proceed risk-adapted radiotherapy . RISK-ADAPTED RADIOTHERAPY : Beginning 3 week completion consolidation chemotherapy , patient undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 3 week ( 14 fraction ) absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients classified RER receive radiation therapy sit bulky disease . Patients classify SER receive radiation therapy sit bulky disease area remain FDG-PET avid induction therapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
