	<brief_title>An Expanded Access Program Decitabine Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) , include diverse group bone marrow disorder result ineffective production blood cell , frequently occur elderly patient . Historically , available treatment MDS symptomatic supportive , show effective produce sustained improvement hematopoiesis ( production type blood cell ) delay leukemic evolution ( leukemia serious disease many white blood cell produce , cause weakness sometimes death ) . This project open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , multicenter , international single arm , Phase 3b study provide expand access Decitabine patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The purpose study provide Decitabine patient Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) accord medical classification : FAB ( French-American-British ) subtypes Intermediate-1 , Intermediate-2 , High-Risk International Prognostic Scoring System group , include previously treat untreated MDS . The secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability Decitabine , well overall response rate accord International Working Group ( IWG ) 2000 IWG 2006 response criterion , hematologic improvement , cytogenetic response rate ( evaluation base genetic ) , time acute myeloid leukemia progression death ( evaluate length time pass prior onset leukemia progression and/or death ) , blood product transfusion requirement per patient ( correspond date collect number transfusion independent day ) , day hospital ( include reason hospitalization ward within hospital hospitalization occur ) , optionally , quality life assessment ( EORTC QLQ C-30 ) . 3-day cycle : Decitabine administer 15mg/m2 administer continuous infusion 3 hour repeat every 8 hour 3 day . 5-day cycle : Another optional schedule could adopt ( discretion investigator ) , Decitabine dose 20mg/mÂ² administer intravenously 1 hour , daily 5 consecutive day , 4-week cycle . Treatment may continue long patient continue benefit .</detailed_description>
