	<brief_title>Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) Plus Minus AMD3100 Engraftment Post Allogeneic Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients adequate blood count recovery post relate unrelated stem cell transplant give `` boost '' T-cell deplete , enriched stem cell hopefully improve blood count . The unrelated donor receive G-CSF prior pheresis ( collection stem cell ) boost number CD34+ cell . The related donor receive G-CSF AMD3100 prior pheresis boost number CD34+ cell . Once CD34+ cell collect T-cell deplete use cell separation device call CliniMACS system . The CliniMACS system select CD34+ cell remove T-cells . By remove T-cells minimize risk Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) . The enriched CD34+ cell give hopefully give `` boost '' cell permanently produce new blood cell improve risk infection bleeding .</detailed_description>

Women child bear potential willing avoid become pregnant receive treatment plerixafor . Donor must adequate peripheral venous catheter access leukapheresis must agree placement central catheter . Recipient Patients confirm relapse original disease Participation clinical trial involve investigational drug device except permission Principal Investigator Sponsor . Patients document active viral , bacterial fungal infection . Documented allergy murine proteins iron dextran . Pregnancy Patients immune mediate graft dysfunction . Donor Evidence active infection time study entry . Medical physical reason make donor unlikely tolerate cooperate growth factor therapy leukapheresis Factors place donor increase risk complication leukapheresis GCSF therapy ( e.g. , autoimmune disease , multiple sclerosis , sickle cell trait , coronary artery disease ) .
