	<brief_summary>In order confirm feasibility home monitoring Monica AN 24 , license portable device measure fetal maternal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , feasibility inpatient monitoring Monica AN 24 patient Propess ( vaginal license drug delivery system use induction labour ) , perform pilot study include 20 woman arm . Feasibility monitoring Monica AN 24 hospital home confirm pilot study . The success define least 10 minute continuous satisfactory trace give hour least 80 % patient . A main study conduct assess feasibility acceptability Propess Monica AN24package care woman undergo induction labour . The research question : 1 . Is outpatient induction continuous monitoring technically feasible ? 2 . Does Propess Monica AN24 care package care provide adequate clinical information line UK National Institute Clinical Evidence ( NICE ) Guideline Induction labour ? 3 . Is outpatient induction concept appeal woman ? 4 . What woman consider advantage disadvantage package care ? 5 . What would woman consider positive and/or negative outcome future clinical trial outpatient induction ? 6 . Do fetus abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) pattern evidence subclinically impaired cardiac function ( feasibility study ) ? 7 . Do elevated concentration white blood cell component umbilical cord blood birth influence fetal electrocardiogram ( feasibility study ) ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion criterion Women singleton pregnancy cephalic presentation book induction labour unfavourable cervix ( Bishop score &lt; 6 ) normal pre-induction fetal monitoring . Low risk woman context study include : - Uncomplicated pregnancy require induction labour complete 37 week pregnancy normal fetal assessment include : 1 . Social inductions/maternal request 2 . Induction labour symphysis pubic dysfunction 3 . Obstetric Cholestasis 4 . Nonspecific Proteinuria ( without medical problem ) - Parity &lt; 4 - Intact membrane study entry - Living within reasonable distance hospital ( i.e. , approximately 60 minute drive time ) - Caregiver present time home - Easy access safe method transport return hospital - Easy access telephone ( either land line mobile good service ) - Agrees remove pessary follow instruction patient leaflet - Written inform consent Exclusion criterion - Previous caesarean section - Abnormal preinduction Cradiotocogram ( CTG ) - Multiple pregnancy - Fetal malformation chromosomal abnormality - Maternal age le 18 year - Contraindication Propess induction - Breech Presentation - Foetal growth restriction - Hypertension - All Diabetics Recruitment In Liverpool Women 's Hospital , woman complete 37 week Pregnancy require induction labour ( per inclusion/exclusion criterion ) attend Antenatal clinic , delivery suite Obstetric Assessment Unit offer management option . Women normal cardiotocogram ( CTG ) , normal amniotic fluid volume cephalic presentation confirm ultrasound , decide induction labour approach one investigator . The participant information sheet give woman , participation study offer . Women accept participation approach admit Induction Suite 1-3 day later . Women labour spontaneously induction day manage accord standard hospital protocol ask take part study . On admission Induction Suite woman ask sign inform consent form eligibility consent woman confirm . Study progress Women sign consent form Monica AN24 fetal monitor attach abdomen . Women follow standard clinical protocol include : - 30 minute fetal heart rate monitoring ( FHR ) . This must reassure continue study ; - Prescription administration Propess - A 1 hour FHR monitoring woman recumbent position hospital If remote FHR monitoring establish initial assessment hospital , woman remain hospital . If in-hospital FHR signal satisfactory , fetal monitoring continue perform Monica AN24 throughout labour induction . If point signal deem inadequate , standard CTG monitoring commence . Women invite complete semi-structured diary throughout outpatient episode care . The woman 's main supporter labour ( partner , mother , friend ) also invite add comment diary . The diary collected admission hospital place opaque envelope . The diary collect Qualitative Team read clinicians/researchers involve clinical care . Women meet inclusion none exclusion criterion satisfactory in-hospital Monica AN24 signal take instruction leaflets AN24 Propess . If comfortable set instruction staff member believe understand study handle emergency situation , allow home . They advise case research staff observe suboptimal/non-reassuring fetal heart rate signal , contact phone come back hospital . Participating woman also provide specially enable mobile phone duration involvement study . The patient leaflet provide woman deem suitable home monitoring include instruction contact hospital staff come back hospital case : 1. vaginal bleed 2. painful uterine contraction require pain relief 3. rhythmic , firm , uterine contraction occur frequency â‰¥ 3 10 minute last 45 second 4. rupture membrane 5 . Pessary fall Women provide contact number Induction Suite ( staff 24/7 ) , may contact Induction Suite staff telephone reassurance time . The Monica AN24 monitor upload data central data base every 30 second via Bluetooth technology . The fetal heart rate uterine activity pattern display PC monitor situate Induction Suite . This review periodically experienced midwife per standard hospital practice woman undergo cervical ripening . Women tell return hospital case : 1 . Evidence uterine hypertonus define single contraction duration least 2 minute 2 . Evidence uterine tachysystole define least 6 contraction 10 minute 2 consecutive 10 minute period 3 . Non reassuring/pathological fetal heart rate ( FHR ) 4 . In case regular uterine contraction ( least 3 10 minute ) patient contact midwife ask contraction painful . If patient refers contraction non painful , home monitoring continue . Whilst participant home , situation arise staff believe require removal pessary ( Propess ) , telephone participant instruct remove dispose insert , request immediately return hospital . The staff member evaluate situation also determine whether emergency transport require , i.e. , ambulance , whether car/taxi acceptable . At 24 hour , assume none reason return hospital occur ; woman ask return hospital removal pessary assessment . Further management accord standard hospital protocol fail induction . Provided FHR signal Monica AN24 device adequate , device use monitoring throughout first stage labour . In second stage labour standard cardiotocogram ( CTG ) monitoring add . If point labour signal consider inadequate , standard cardiotocogram ( CTG ) monitoring provide . After birth , cord blood collect analysis lactate , cardiac enzyme , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) reactive protein C. These result disclose clinician influence subsequent management . Women also ask give consent ( optional ) one neonatal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record hospital discharge feasible . Women also ask participate face face interview birth determine view outpatient care . This interview arrange member Qualitative Team discharge hospital take place either home hospital depend woman 's wish .</detailed_description>
