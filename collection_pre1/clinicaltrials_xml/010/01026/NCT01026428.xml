	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate effect safinamide levodopa blood level , single multiple dose safinamide . A objective study ass safety tolerability safinamide give together levodopa applied regimen . For purpose , study participant undergo intensive blood sample investigation levodopa level various tolerability examination , measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , body temperature ) , record ECGs question find study participant feel . Furthermore , blood sample draw urine test perform repeatedly safety purpose course study . The result clinical trial may use drug registration safinamide future .</brief_summary>
