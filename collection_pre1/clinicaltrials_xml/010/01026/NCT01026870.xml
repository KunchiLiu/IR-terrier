	<brief_summary>Mometasone furoate ( MF ) synthetic glucocorticosteroid , administer asthma patient dry powder inhaler ( Asmanex® Twisthaler® ) dosages 100 400 mcg twice daily , show improve lung function , reduce symptom asthma , reduce frequency severity exacerbation reduce airway inflammation , relatively low potential cause systemic side effect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression . An experimental formulation MF 100 mcg deliver twice daily via pressurized metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) also show effective improving lung function asthma patient measure forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) . This trial design verify effectiveness twice daily MF MDI 100 mcg treat asthma adult adolescents previously treat low dosage inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , measure improvement morning FEV1 time first asthma exacerbation 12 week treatment .</brief_summary>
