	<brief_summary>Rationale : Diagnostic procedure , MRI , may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment . Purpose : This clinical trial study MRI predict response sunitinib malate patient locally advance metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Predicting Response Sunitinib Malate Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : I . To correlate tumor vascular permeability DCE-MRI clinical outcome patient treat sunitinib ( PFS ) . II . To correlate genetic histologic characteristic primary tumor vascular permeability DCE-MRI . Secondary Objectives : I . To correlate genetic histologic characteristic primary tumor clinical outcome patient treat sunitinib . II . Samples collect potential future exploratory analyse pharmacokinetic pharmacogenomic parameter . Outline : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI baseline first 4 week sunitinib malate .</detailed_description>
