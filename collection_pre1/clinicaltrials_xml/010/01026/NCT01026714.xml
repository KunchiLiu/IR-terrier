	<brief_summary>The cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYP ) major drug-metabolizing enzyme system human . A great inter- individual variability affect activity enzyme , consequently plasma drug concentration result different pharmacodynamic effect occurrence effect side . Environmental factor , diet , drug genetics responsible variability . Genetic factor important since majority enzymes highly polymorphic . For example , 80 CYP2D6 allelic variant discover far associate absence , decrease , increase enzyme activity . Most polymorphisms detected adverse reaction occur group within population normal dos drug administrate . Those patient experience adverse reaction often reduce capability metabolize certain drug . In clinical therapy , variability important consequence include lack response treatment and/or adverse drug reaction . In order reduce potentially unwanted event possibly lead sever adverse reaction death , might therefore decisive interest able ass activity enzymes individual level . Two approach may use assess CYPs activity , genotype phenotype . Genotype base DNA analysis polymorphism detection . Phenotype consist administration `` model '' drug probe drug metabolize specific CYP determination ratio drug metabolite plasma urine . The principal drawback phenotyping method urine collection overnight least 8 hour administration probe test . This procedure tedious time consume patient well medical staff . The test perform plasma blood 1-2 hour probe administration . However , procedure invasive need important volume blood ( 6 ml ) . Recently , novel approach develop quantitative determination circulate drug concentration use dried blood spot ( DBS ) filter paper obtain simple finger prick . Due small blood volume require ( 10 ÂµL ) compare conventional sampling , minimally invasive method provide patient-friendly alternative blood collection patient population venous sample unethical impossible ( pediatrics ) . In addition , DBS sample require use anticoagulant , plasma separation decrease contact infectious material . Furthermore , dry blood spot easily store shipped analytical laboratory without use refrigerated device . Thanks new development analytical technique ( mass spectrometry ) , permit quantitative analysis small volume blood . DBS sample represent powerful tool biomedical analysis , particularly pharmacokinetic study several blood sample need phenotyping procedure .</brief_summary>
