	<detailed_description>Primary care provider ( PCP ) recruit within Winnipeg Regional Health Authority ( WRHA ) community area St. James Assiniboia , Assiniboine South , Downtown , River Heights , Fort Garry , St. Vital St. Boniface . The first step recruit PCP within WRHA involve pre-collaboration call PCP/clinics make aware study coordinator drop PCP Collaboration Letter briefly outline propose research study request participation PCP . The letter inquire whether PCP/clinic would interest collaborating study well best date , time method contact office . Based information , study coordinator contact clinic preferred manner set date time determine interest study collaboration , , set date time site visit discus study protocol PCP/clinic involvement responsibility . Once PCP/clinic agree collaborate study , PCP/Clinic Characterization Form complete study coordinator . The purpose form document routine standard care provide PCP regard CRC screen practice FOBT ensure minimal obtrusiveness study protocol daily function PCP/clinic . It believe , Winnipeg , two standard method patient complete FOBT exist ; laboratory requisition fill PCP direct distribution FOBT kit PCP patient . By fill PCP/Clinic Characterization Form , prefer method FOBT screen PCP/clinic document . This factor take account covariate statistical analysis data . All PCP within medical clinic randomly allocate one two study group ( control intervention ) . In case medical clinic sub-groupings PCP/staff function single/separate unit/entity , sub-group PCPs randomize separately . The objective customizing portion study protocol PCP/clinic optimize collaboration PCPs well simulate `` real world '' PCP practice result evidence-based finding able integrated practice . Collaborating PCP/clinics randomly allocate providing average risk male female patient ( 50-74 year ) either control intervention protocol FOBT screening CRC . As one type control group one study intervention ( provision magnet contact information Provincial Health Contact Center ( PHCC ) Colorectal Cancer Information FOBT Screening Website ) total two study group : ( 1 ) FOBT recommendation base usual PCP practice , ( 2 ) FOBT recommendation base usual PCP practice + magnet . Once PCP/Clinic randomize group , patient participate study group . Upon arrival periodic health examination ( PHE ) appointment , eligible patient study group ask front desk clinic support staff employee complete In-Clinic Patient Survey/Consent Form related exposure Provincial CRC Screening initiative ( CancerCare Manitoba ; ColonCheck ) whether complete FOBT conjunction CancerCare Manitoba Screening Program last two year . During PHE , PCP determine patient eligibility accord criterion outline study coordinator site visit . PCPs control group provide patient laboratory requisition indicate FOBT directly provide FOBT kit patient . Those patient lab requisition indicate FOBT receive FOBT kit laboratory . PCP control intervention group provide Patient Tracking Forms ( one per patient ) PCP indicate patient name date FOBT requisition/distribution . Each Patient Tracking Form removable sticker unique patient study identification number . The PCP remove sticker Patient Tracking Form place patient 's In-Clinic Survey allow researcher link data . Study identification number facilitate patient track well allow study coordinator determine PCP/clinic , number patient request PCP/clinic complete FOBT . It also facilitate track patient complete FOBT . The study coordinator follow-up PCP/clinic support staff determine patient complete FOBT . Patients give four month complete FOBT . After time , FOBT complete , assign incomplete accord intention treat model . In way , personal health identification protect . The study coordinator contact PCP/clinics regularly Patient Tracking Form update foster collaborative relationship researcher PCP . PCP/clinics allocate intervention group utilize Patient Tracking Forms describe . Each Patient Tracking Form sheet sequentially number study magnet attach PCP provide patient . The refrigerator magnet contains study specific PHCC telephone number Website address well brief message importance FOBT early detection CRC . The sheet sequential study identification number Patient Tracking Forms facilitate determine number patient FOBT request number patient provide magnet . Patients provide magnet use number assign magnet identify PHCC nurse begin every call make well login website . This allow u determine many patient provide magnet call PHCC/use website well number time call/login common question . The number magnet allow u determine call/login PHCC , number complete FOBT . A four month follow-up patient survey conduct PHCC evaluate patient experience PHCC and/or CRC Information Screening Website well possible barrier FOBT compliance . We also conduct survey PCPs involve study determine experience study protocol well facilitate PCP collaboration research . The study design two-tailed alpha error 0.05 % , beta error 10 % power index 90 % . Current FOBT screen rate Manitoba approximately 41.9 % ( Statistics Canada , 2009 ) . It believe intervention lead increase FOBT screen rate 15 % would clinically significant predict approximately 70 % Canadians age 50 74 biennial FOBT , follow colonoscopy positive FOBTs , CRC mortality rate could reduce estimate 17 % ( Statistics Canada , 2009 ) . A logistic regression binary response variable ( Y ) binary independent variable ( X ) sample size 716 observation [ 80 % group utilize supplied intervention/magnet PHCC Website ( X=0 ) 20 % group utilize intervention/magnet PHCC Website ( X=1 ) ] achieve 90 % power 0.05 significance level detect change Prob ( Y=1 ) baseline value 0.400 0.550 . This change correspond odds ratio 1.833 . A biostatistician involved statistical analysis result . Analysis result base Intention Treat Model . Therefore , patient return FOBT test within period four month score fail complete FOBT test . Categorical variable compare use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . The time take return FOBT card estimate use Kaplan-Meier analysis . Statistical analysis perform use SAS SPSS Software . All form provide PCP/Clinics collect study coordinator end study .</detailed_description>
