	<brief_summary>Erlotinib type drug call tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . TKIs block protein call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR may control tumor growth tumor cell survival . EGFR find surface many type cancer cell , include non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Erlotinib approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment NSCLC . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) drug approve FDA treatment malaria , rheumatoid arthritis , several disease currently think cancer treatment . Previous laboratory study suggest HCQ may anti-cancer effect situation , particularly EGFR TKI drug useful past tumor . The two drug together may able fight lung cancer case erlotinib longer effective . The purpose research study determine high dose HCQ give safely combination erlotinib . We also begin look whether HCQ plus erlotinib help treat cancer become resistant TKI treatment initially respond .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine With Without Erlotinib Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The goal study find high dose HCQ give safely erlotinib . Therefore , participant receive dose HCQ . Small group participant enrol step trial . The first group give certain dose HCQ . If manageable side effect , next small group participant enrol receive high dose . This increase dose continue research doctor find high dose HCQ give without cause severe unmanageable side effect . - Both HCQ erlotinib pill take orally . Treatment divide time period call cycle . Each treatment cycle 28 day . The exception 28 day cycle participant start take pill first time . Erlotinib start first 7 day HCQ add . When HCQ begin , first cycle 28 day begin . - There several test procedure perform specific time period protocol treatment . These include : blood work , performance status assessment , question medical history medication , tumor assessment CT MRI , eye exam . - Participants may continue receive study treatment long experience unacceptable side effect disease progression .</detailed_description>
