	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Cervical Cancer That Is Recurrent , Locally Advanced , Metastatic , Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ( objective response rate ) temsirolimus give intravenously ( IV ) weekly patient metastatic and/or locally advance recurrent carcinoma cervix . II . To assess adverse event , time progression response duration temsirolimus give IV weekly patient metastatic and/or locally advance recurrent carcinoma cervix . III . To explore relationship expression proteins mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway archival tissue sample patient trial objective response therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . For complete responder , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity 2 course complete response criterion first meet . For patient , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month ( patient complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , stable disease [ SD ] ) thereafter .</detailed_description>
