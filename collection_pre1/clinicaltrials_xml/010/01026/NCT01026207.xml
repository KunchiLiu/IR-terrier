	<brief_summary>Introduction : The prevalence overlap Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) around 10 % . This overlap syndrome important issue relate nocturnal desaturation complication . The use portable monitoring device ( PM ) diagnosis OSAS recently accept alternative full-night polysomnography ( PSG ) . However , study evaluate PM record COPD patient detect exclude OSAS . Objective : To evaluate PM ( StardustÂ® , Respironics , Inc , USA ) could accurately measure apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) COPD patient suspicion OSAS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Portable Monitoring Device Diagnosis Sleep Apnea Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit Pneumology outpatient clinic UNIFESP , Patients diagnose COPD GOLD 's stage II III , stable ( COPD exacerbation last three month ) , use bronchodilator without dose change period , symptom suggestive OSAS ( loud snoring , report breathing pause sleep excessive sleepiness ) . We exclude patient sleep-related disorder , diagnosis and/or previous treatment OSAS , severe cardiovascular disorder neuromuscular disease use oxygen , psychotropic drug , alcohol drug abuse . Patients undergo two assessment sleep , randomly determine : 1 ) PM home one night , 2 ) PM sleep laboratory simultaneously PSG . Three apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) value obtain analyzed : ) AHI PM home , b ) AHI PM laboratory , c ) AHI PSG . Analyses evaluation perform two trained technician , blind study detail .</detailed_description>
