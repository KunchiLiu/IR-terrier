	<detailed_description>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease ( LCP ) represent loss blood flow head femur , result significant hip pain potential long term disability . The cause LCP still unknown , tend occur predominantly boys age 4-12 . For majority affect , observation symptomatic treatment oral antiinflammatories , ibuprofen , indicate . This study represent single center , randomize , prospective , control study compare treatment LCP intraarticular corticosteroid ( triamcinolone hexacetonide ) injection traditional nonoperative treatment . The investigator test improve outcome measure functional outcome ( PODCI ASKp questionnaire , StepWatch activity monitor ) , hip range motion visual-analog pain scale . The investigator hypothesize injection corticosteroid ( potent , injectable antiinflammatories ) result improve overall function decrease pain increase hip range motion patient population.Additional biological research perform . There human information inflammatory response occur hip joint child Perthes disease , true animal model Perthes disease . To good understand pathobiology Perthes disease , collection joint fluid hip may provide insight treatment disease currently explanation cause , consequently therapy</detailed_description>
