	<brief_summary>This research study examine effect study medication Armodafinil patient dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) . DLB associate memory thinking problem , excessive daytime sleepiness , hallucination , delusion , apathy , reduce quality life . One type medication could potentially improve daytime sleepiness , memory thinking skill , hallucination , delusion , apathy , quality life know wake-promoting medication . Armodafinil wake-promoting medication develop treatment patient narcolepsy , sleep apnea , disorder cause excessive daytime sleepiness . The drug use study consider investigational , mean either approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) routine clinical use use describe study . However FDA allow use drug/device research study . In study , patient DLB receive daily oral Armodafinil tablet , response treatment assess 12 week . This study involve placebo medication , patient receive Armodafinil treatment .</brief_summary>
