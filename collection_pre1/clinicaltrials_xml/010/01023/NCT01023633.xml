	<brief_summary>Previous OPTIMOX1 study investigate use oxaliplatin discontinuation reintroduction novel stop-and-go strategy . Previously untreated patient randomly assign either FOLFOX4 administer every 2 week progression ( arm A ) FOLFOX7 6 cycle , maintenance without oxaliplatin 12 cycle , reintroduction FOLFOX7 another 6 cycle ( arm B ) . Data show significant difference median progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) two arm . Furthermore , study show low Grade 3 neurotoxicity rate arm B ( 17.9 % vs 13.3 % , P = 0.12 ) .In order investigate efficacy feasibility novel `` Stop go '' strategy Chinese mCRC patient , Prof. Shu Yongqian JiangShu Province Hospital plan conduct randomize control study compare continuous FOLFOX4 vs. FOLFOX4 Stop-and-Go Fashion 1st Line mCRC patient . To avoid high oxaliplatin dosage relate neurotoxicity , FOLFOX4 regimen choose study .</brief_summary>
