	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Alogliptin Plus Metformin Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 19 million people United States diagnose diabetes mellitus , 90 % 95 % type 2 . The prevalence type 2 diabetes varies among racial ethnic population show correlate age , obesity , family history , history gestational diabetes physical inactivity . Over next decade , mark increase number adult diabetes mellitus expect . Metformin usual choice first-line therapy type 2 diabetes . Metformin target insulin resistance type 2 diabetes inhibit hepatic glucose production stimulate glucose uptake skeletal muscle adipose tissue , result long-term glucose-lowering effect . Alogliptin inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme think primarily responsible vivo degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion , namely glucagon-like peptide-1 glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide . Both peptide exert important effect islet beta cell stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion well regulate beta cell proliferation cytoprotection . Glucagon-like peptide-1 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide , inhibit gastric emptying , glucagon secretion , food intake . Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide show enhance insulin secretion direct interaction glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide -specific receptor islet beta cell . The glucose-lowering action glucagon-like peptide-1 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide , preserve patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . It expect inhibition dipeptidyl peptidase IV improve glycemic ( glucose ) control patient type 2 diabetes . Based potential , complimentary mechanism action alogliptin metformin , study compare safety efficacy alogliptin metformin ( SYR-322MET ) improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately control diet adjustment exercise alone . Participants take part study receive dietary exercise coaching , monitor blood glucose concentration home glucose monitor . Participants also require maintain hypoglycemic diary throughout course study . Participation study expect last 34 week .</detailed_description>
