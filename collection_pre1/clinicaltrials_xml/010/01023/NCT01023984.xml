	<brief_title>Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery Versus Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection For Large Rectal Adenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROBLEM DEFINITION Rectal cancer common disease Western country , increase high age , male sex obesity ( 1,2 ) . As district , premalignant intraepithelial neoplasia inside rectal adenoma precedes occurrence invasive rectal cancer ( 3,4 ) . Early endoscopic detection removal rectal adenoma prevents development rectal cancer therefore reliable contributor 'cure ' disease ( 5,6 ) . When rectal adenoma become large , however , standard endoscopic therapy like loop polypectomy one-step endoscopic resection result inadequate . Therefore , large rectal adenoma must remove en-bloc either surgically extend endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) . In 1983 novel surgical approach resection large rectal adenoma introduce clinical practice Germany : Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery ( TEM ) . ( 7 ) This procedure encompass general anesthesia use expensive specialized equipment . On hand , generally allow full-thickness rectal wall excision . Since introduction , many surgical practice adopt TEM new standard therapy large rectal adenoma ( 8 ) . In recent year advance endoscopic therapy like extend ESD rapidly evolved. ( 9 ) . For extended ESD en-bloc specimen , include mucosa consistent portion submucosal layer , resect instead full-thickness rectal wall , combine advantage en-bloc resection potential benefit few complication . Supporters TEM technique praise excellent exposure rectum minimal invasiveness , oppose conventional surgical technique . ( 10-12 ) Besides , recurrence rate TEM appear low compare conventional surgical transanal excision . ( 13 ) The TEM technique show highly efficacious several retrospective prospective case series report recurrence rate 0-19 % complication rate 2-21 % . ( 14-23 ) On hand , extend ESD gain support last year , mainly due good clinical result ESD neoplasia esophagus stomach report Japanese center ( 24,25 ) ESD also describe treatment large colorectal adenoma , reveal recurrence rate 0-9 % complication rate 0-9 % ( 9,27 ) . If adenoma could remove completely one ESD attempt , repeat ESD residual disease generally lead overall success rate 96-100 % . In general , recurrence detect first control endoscopy 3 month ; repeat endoscopic resection residual disease lead overall success rate almost 100 % . Since efficacy extend ESD large rectal adenoma appear comparable TEM , decide design randomize trial . In fact , , TEM ESD never formally compare , comparative study register moment . Although selection bias inevitably exist prospective retrospective case series , result study suggest TEM ESD comparable recurrence rate . Even recurrences occur TEM ESD , successfully re-treated without need radical surgery . The literature furthermore suggest ESD associate few complication , reduce hospital admission , general anesthesia require ESD , favorable patient ' societal perspective . These contrast two procedure might well lead difference cost quality life . Therefore , design multicentre randomize trial compare TEM ESD resection large rectal adenoma . RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second common cancer Western country . Rectal cancer account approximately 40 % CRC case . The treatment rectal cancer encompass multidisciplinary collaboration include gastroenterologist , surgeon , oncologist , radiotherapist specialize nurse practitioner . Standard therapy consist radical surgery combination radiotherapy ( possibly chemotherapy ) , major morbidity mortality ( 28 ) . Therefore , disease major impact health care service ( 29 ) . Since early detection removal rectal adenoma prevents occurrence rectal cancer , CRC screen adopt many western country ( 30 ) . When CRC screening introduce , inevitably lead increase detection early rectal neoplasia ( 31 ) . It therefore expect rectal adenoma need endoscopic surgical treatment forthcoming year . Consequently , appropriate therapy concern efficacy , safety , quality life cost must select deal expect increase rectal adenoma . Traditionally , adenomatous colorectal lesion could resect endoscopically refer surgery . Conventional surgical approach like radical surgery trans-sphincteric trans-sacral operation nowadays replace TEM , since procedure higher efficacy lower morbidity . In recent year endoscopic therapy evolve , result large rectal adenoma often treat flexible endoscopy . In case series , endoscopic resection large colorectal adenoma lead recurrence rate slightly high TEM ( 18.0 % versus 6 % ) , retreat endoscopically , complication rate appear low equivalent slightly low ( 4 % versus 8 % ) ( 32 ) . Furthermore , ESD safely perform conscious sedation , short hospital admission require opposed TEM . The reduced morbidity , reduce hospital admission redundancy anesthesia associate ESD beneficial patient ' societal perspective . OBJECTIVE Hypothesis Transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) extend endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) effective treatment large rectal adenoma comparable recurrence rate . However , ESD require general/spinal anesthesia may associate low morbidity . Therefore , ESD may improve quality life reduce health care cost . Objective The main objective propose randomize study compare effectiveness TEM ESD removal large rectal adenoma . Primary Endpoint : incidence recurrence 3 month Secondary Endpoints : morbidity , subdivide major ( require surgery ) minor ( require endoscopic medical intervention ) anorectal function . disease specific general quality life ; number day spend hospital initial treatment 12 month STRATEGY Design This multicentre randomize trial compare TEM ESD patient large rectal adenoma respect cost-effectiveness safety . Randomization Patient data enter computerized database mean unchangeable computer generate number patient randomize undergo TEM ESD . Blinding Blinding patient physicians treatment unfeasible , since two treatment strategy highly different nature associate care . Study population Patients eligible trial meet follow inclusion criterion : Diagnosed large non-pedunculated rectal adenoma ( sessile flat ) large diameter ≥2 cm ( estimate open resection snare 20 30 mm ) . The low upper border adenoma locate ≥2 cm ≤15 cm anal verge , respectively . Biopsies lesion show malignant neoplastic tissue histopathological evaluation ; lesion low high grade dysplasia suitable inclusion . During flexible video endoscopy sign endoscopic suspicion submucosal invasive cancer ( Kudo pit pattern type V ; excavated/depressed type morphology ; fold convergence ; large smooth nodule &gt; 1 cm flat lesion ) ( 33 ) . In case doubt , patient undergo EUS describe ( 2 ) . In case doubt remain flexible video endoscopy , endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) rectal adenoma exclude invasion submucosal layer exclude pathological lymphadenopathy ( lymph node &gt; 1 cm ) . When pathological lymph node present , fine needle aspiration perform exclude lymph node metastasis ( N+ disease ) . If perform already , total colonoscopy do detect remove synchronous colonic adenoma cancer first . Cecal intubation must confirm identification appendiceal orifice ileocecal valve . The general health condition patient permit general anesthesia ( ASA- classification I-III ) . Absence non-correctable coagulopathy ( international normalize ratio &gt; 1,5 , platelet count &lt; 90 × 109/l ) . Patient age 18 year old . Intervention strategy Transanal endoscopic microsurgery : TEM perform described Buess . ( 7 ) Under general anesthesia specialize TEM rectoscope 12 20 cm length ( Wolf GmbH Knittlingen ) 15 cm length ( Storz GmbH Tuttlingen , Germany ) insert within rectum assure proper visualization lesion . The rectoscope fix operate table support device , provide opportunity reposition rectoscope ongoing surgery . The rectal cavity insufflate CO2 combine endosurgical unit achieve constant distension appropriate visualization rectal adenoma . The combined endosurgical unit regulate irrigation suction , thereby maintain constant intra rectal pressure . With use binocular stereoscopic eyepiece three-dimensional view ( Wolf GmbH ) forward oblique telescope ( Storz GmbH ) magnify view create visualization lesion . With various HF monopolar bipolar instrument , Ultracision harmonic scalpel ( Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Cincinnati , USA ) , needle diathermy , tissue handle forceps , needle holder , suction probe , injection needle , clip applicator ) adenoma dissect mean en-bloc full-thickness rectal wall excision perirectal fat . Postoperatively , patient preserve urinary catheter remove first postoperative day . Patients admit hospital accordance current practice . After 3 month control flexible endoscopy perform surgeon perform TEM procedure . If presume residual disease see , biopsy take confirm presence neoplasia histology . Hereafter , residual adenomatous tissue resect endoscopically either ESD ( &gt; 20 mm ) endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) ( &lt; 20mm ) . Any intervention ESD/EMR 3 month part TEM treatment strategy . Endoscopic submucosal dissection : Endoscopic submucosal dissection perform describe Fujiro ( 9 ) At discretion endoscopist , conscious sedation use 2.5-10 mg midazolam and/or 25-100 µg fentanyl . An endoscope insert rectum air insufflation via endoscope provide proper distension rectum . The submucosa underneath lesion inject endoscopic injection catheter solution saline 0.9 % , 1 ml methylene blue , 1:10,000 unit adrenaline order lift adenoma ( upper volume limit ) . The lesion mark around 5 mm disease free margin APC dot . An endoscopic knife ( Insulated Tip Knife , Olympus Water Jet , Erbe ) use resect lesion submucosal plane en-bloc fashion . Visible submucosal vessel treat endoscopic clip electro-coagulation prevent delay bleeding . Hereafter , edge mucosal defect potential remnant within resection crater always treat APC increase adenoma clearance . If bleeding procedure precludes &gt; 90 % clearance adenoma , ESD procedure consider failure . All patient admit hospital least 24-hours observation ; accordance current practice . After 3 month treat endoscopist perform control endoscopy . If presume residual disease see , biopsy take confirm presence neoplasia histology . Hereafter , residual adenomatous tissue resect endoscopically either ESD ( &gt; 20 mm ) endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) ( &lt; 20mm ) . Any intervention ESD/EMR 3 month part TEM treatment strategy . Intervention failure When technical reason ESD procedure turn performable randomization ESD fail remove &gt; 90 % adenoma , patient automatically undergo TEM treatment strategy . Histopathological evaluation Resection specimens TEM ESD stretch pin cork plate immersion formalin . After standard processing resection specimen transect cm evaluation gastrointestinal pathologist . The lateral basal resection margin evaluate absence neoplasia , possible . The risk lymph node metastasis increase case malignant neoplasia extend submucosal layer , poor tumor differentiation , mucinous cancer , vascular invasion tumor budding , warrant radical surgery ( 34-37 ) . By strict adherence inclusion criterion , risk invasive cancer reduce 1.6-3 % ( 33,38 ) . In case unexpected invasive cancer despite adherence inclusion criterion , patient exclude histopathological evaluation ( late exclusion ) . In case intramucosal cancer ( i.e . invade muscularis mucosa ) , TEM ESD regard sufficient treatment lesion radically remove . Outcome parameter Primary outcome measure ( non-inferiority ) : Recurrence neoplasia , define presence histologically proven neoplastic tissue either visible recurrent lesion random biopsy , take surveillance endoscopy intervention strategy complete . Any remnant adenoma identify treat ESD/EMR/APC 3 month consider part initial intervention strategy arm . Hereafter , patient undergo surveillance endoscopy 6 12 month independent endoscopist blind primary treatment . During surveillance endoscopy recurrence objectively define Higaki criterion recurrence : tumor appear within clear resection scar ; tumor convergent fold ; tumor nearby clear resection scar ( within 5 mm ) . ( 39 ) Targeted biopsy take histological confirmation ; case apparently heal normal scar without evidence recurrence , biopsy take basis 3 edge scar detect occult recurrent neoplasia . The following standardized discharge criterion apply participate hospital : normal intake nutrition ; normal mobility ; absence fever ( &lt; 38°C ) ; stable hemoglobin level 1 day ( &lt; 1 mmol/L ) case rectal blood loss . Additional outcome measure : 1 . Complications : subdivide procedural ( treatment ) delay complication ( end procedure ) ; subdivide major ( require additional surgery ) minor ( require endoscopic medical intervention ) complication . During admission patient monitor complication . In case day discharge hospital patient call telephone 1 day procedure whether adverse event happen . Two week intervention , research nurse contact patient telephone ask occur complication . 2 . Generic disease-specific health relate quality life measure baseline , 2 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year follow-up SF-36 Wexner score ( incontinence ) questionnaires . 3 . Measurement anorectal functional outcome anal manometry rectal volumetry ( barostat ) 3 month treatment . 4 . Costs TEM ESD societal perspective , base primary data ( see economic evaluation section ) . 5 . Patient preference regard TEM ESD measure end follow-up structure questionnaire enable discrete choice experiment address burden care , burden complication , prognostic uncertainty , recurrence rate treatment . Sample size calculation Assuming baseline recurrence rate 6 % TEM ESD ( average recurrence base systematic review ) consider upper limit 10 % ESD non-inferior , β-error 0.2 α-error 0.05 , 60 patient need per randomization group . Since ESD know effective even 2 attempt , upper limit 10 % seem reasonable , whereas high recurrence rate would lead many additional procedure render strategy impracticable probably cost-effective . Patient recruitment Consecutive eligible patient recruit outpatient clinic participate center involve physician ( surgeon/gastroenterologist ) . All patient fulfil above-mentioned criterion inform study physician . After consent give , central randomization take place web-based patient treat accord study protocol . Patients unable refuse provide inform consent treat accord current clinical guideline . Data-analysis Since main outcome study neoplasia recurrence rate , i.e . proportion patient recurrent disease , Chi-square test use compare intervention group ( TEM versus ESD ) . Since event recurrence , time recurrence , important indicator treatment failure , Kaplan Meier method use . The complication mortality rate compare manner . The number day spend hospital additional primary outcome measure compare Wilcoxon rank sum test . Differences intervention group continuous outcome measure ( e.g . Wexner incontinence scale , quality life questionnaire , manometry/volumetry ) test student 's t-test Wilcoxon rank sum test , appropriate . All analysis carry primarily intention-to-treat basis . Time schedule Patients recruit study October 2009 December 2010 participate center . All randomize patient follow 12 month ( December 2011 ) . The last 3 month ( March 2012 ) use statistical analysis reporting data .</detailed_description>
