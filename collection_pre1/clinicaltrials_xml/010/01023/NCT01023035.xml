	<brief_summary>The current trial design prospectively explore safety erythropoietin use treatment anemia boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2b/Ribavirin ( PEG2b/RBV ) therapy ass relationship efficacy . All participant trial treat triple combination boceprevir plus PEG2b/RBV . If participant becomes anemic treatment , participant randomize one two therapeutic strategy management anemia ( erythropoietin use versus RBV dose reduction ) .</brief_summary>
