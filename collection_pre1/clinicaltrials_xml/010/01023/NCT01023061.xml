	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well abiraterone acetate , prednisone , leuprolide acetate goserelin radiation therapy work treat patient localize locally advanced prostate cancer . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , abiraterone acetate , leuprolide acetate , goserelin , may lessen amount androgen make body . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving abiraterone acetate leuprolide acetate goserelin together radiation therapy may effective treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate , Prednisone , Leuprolide Acetate Goserelin Before During Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Localized Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety abiraterone ( abiraterone acetate ) prednisone luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist give neoadjuvant concurrent therapy external beam radiation patient localized prostate cancer . II . To determine whether pharmacologic suppression prostatic androgen axis inhibition androgen production abiraterone decrease tissue androgen level observe gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist suppression testicular androgen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether treatment abiraterone acetate LHRH agonist effective LHRH agonist bicalutamide induce inhibition androgen-regulated gene expression increase apoptotic cell death assess immunohistochemistry , complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) microarray analysis reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . II . To evaluate time prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression patient treat LHRH agonist abiraterone acetate . OUTLINE : Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally ( PO ) prednisone PO daily ( QD ) 24 week . Patients also receive leuprolide acetate goserelin week 1 13 . Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy start week 15 8.5 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
