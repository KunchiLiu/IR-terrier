The low effectiveness associate development intrinsic acquire resistance tumor , clinically show early progression transitory response . Tobacco smoke major risk factor NSCLC ; however , wood smoke describe strong carcinogen relevant risk factor development NSCLC . Current data indicates lung tumor associate tobacco smoking wood smoke show different clinical characteristic , suggests might also different genetic alteration , consequence tumor etiology . The description frequency type mutation associate different etiology NSCLC could represent start point benefiting patient accord specific characteristic . One research signal pathway relate cancer cell proliferation one activate K-RAS oncogene . Active K-RAS mutation detect different type neoplasia 90 % mutation occur codon 12 oncogene . These mutation seem independent risk factor prognosis malignant tumor associate lack response erlotinib , tyrosine-kinase inhibitor . The investigator ' research team recently report wood smoke independent factor survival response erlotinib treatment , suggest carcinogen could different frequency pattern mutation K-RAS oncogene , compare report smoking patient . Determining tumor mutation within K-RAS oncogene help improve response prognosis patient advance NSCLC background exposure different factor associate appearance neoplasia , wood smoke exposure tobacco smoking . Therefore , objective research determine frequency type mutation codon 12 K-RAS oncogene patient NSCLC background exposure tobacco smoke wood smoke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>K-RAS Oncogene Mutation Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Associated With Exposure Wood Smoke Tobacco Smoking : Therapeutic Implications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Lung cancer lead cause cancer-related death among men woman worldwide ( 1 ) . In 2007 , 213,380 new case lung cancer register ; case , 160,390 death report . This number represent 15 % total case 29 % cancer-related deaths world . Only 13 % patient lung cancer survive 5 year [ surveillance epidemiology end result ( seer ) statistic http : //seer . cancer.gov/ ] , therefore still serious health problem ( 2 ) . Clinically speaking , lung cancer divide two main category cover small cell lung cancer non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . About 75 % lung tumor NSCLC , include squamous cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , large cell carcinoma ( 1 ) . Despite multimodal treatment use chemotherapy , radiotherapy surgery poor prognosis locally advance NSCLC . Survival rate clinical stage IIIA 64 % one year 23 % 30 % five year ; clinical stage IIIB 32 % 3 % one five year , respectively ( 3 ) . While advancement treatment NSCLC make , survival rate improvement achieve . Tobacco smoking consider main cause NSCLC , risk factor well , exposure asbestos , radon , heavy metal , wood smoke . The latter described human carcinogen important risk factor development NSCLC . The frequency exposure wood smoke patient NSCLC 28 % ( 2 ) . Current data indicates lung cancer associate tobacco smoke lung cancer associate wood smoke exposure present different clinical characteristic , suggests might also different genetic alteration , consequence tumor etiology . Nevertheless , significant molecular research make possible determine difference pattern mutation oncogene involve lung tumorigenesis , relation risk factor account patient . Recent advance knowledge cancer biology lead identification various potential molecular target play major role development progression disease . One extensively research signal pathway involve cell proliferation survival one activate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . When epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) bind extracellular domain EGFR kinase property receptor activate regulate activation different signal pathway . One pathways lead activation K-RAS , time activate pathway MAP kinase , involve proliferation , differentiation , migration , survival cell ( fundamental event oncogenesis ) . Reports indicate mutation EGFR find 51 % non-smoking patient ( 4 ) 10 % smoking patient , mutation K-RAS occur 30 % 50 % lung adenocarcinomas associate tobacco . Active mutation K-RAS occur NSCLC , also occur &gt; 50 % colorectal adenocarcinoma , 75 % pancreatic tumor , 48 % lung cancer , 44 % adrenocortical tumor ( 5 ) . These mutation seem independent risk factor prognosis malignant tumor , since 90 % occur codon 12 K-RAS gene ( 6-8 ) , associate lack response erlotinib ( 9 ) , tyrosine-kinase inhibitor . Our research team recently report wood smoke independent factor survival response treatment erlotinib ( 10 ) . This information strongly support hypothesis lung cancer tumorigenesis result different molecular mechanism accord smoker 's stage ( 11 ) carcinogenic factor associate appearance malignant neoplasia , wood smoke exposure . Therefore , believe , compare report smoking patient , wood smoke could cause different frequency pattern mutation K-RAS oncogene . It clinical relevance determine whether patient NSCLC expose wood smoke present difference frequency type mutation K-RAS gene , respect smoke non-smoking patient . Actually , number potential biological marker investigate aim select patient receive specific therapy thus achieve good result regard response treatment overall survival . This ability detect K-RAS mutation associate risk factor NSCLC could represent start point propose different treatment approach benefit patient accord specific characteristic tumor . General Objective : To define frequency type mutation codon 12 K-RAS oncogene occur patient non-small cell lung cancer background wood smoke exposure tobacco smoking . Materials Methods : The presence mutation K-RAS oncogene evaluate retrospectively 50 patient advanced NSCLC background wood smoke exposure 50 patient NSCLC background tobacco smoking . Additionally , 50 patient NSCLC without background exposure risk factor lung cancer prospectively evaluate . For patient prospectively study , inclusion criterion follow : patient diagnose advanced NSCLC stage IIIB/IV receive previous chemotherapy , radiotherapy tumor tissue embed paraffin block formalin-fixed ; patient must sign informed consent letter . The exclusion criterion : patient refuse participate study decide withdraw , patient without tumor tissue poor quality sample . The tumor sample , formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded , used histological diagnosis patient obtain Pathology Departments National Cancer Institute National Institute Respiratory Diseases ; sample use gather DNA analysis K-RAS mutation . The clinical data patient obtain medical file . DNA extraction : Genomic DNA extract standard procedure area paraffin slide contain &gt; 50 % tumor use QIAamp DNAFFPE Tissue Kit ( QIAGEN ) , accord manufacturer 's instruction . Analysis K-RAS oncogene mutation KRAS gene mutation sample detect Therascreen RGQ PCR Kit ( QUIAGEN , Scorpions ARMS method ) , accord manufacturer 's instruction . For statistical analysis result , continuous variable present arithmetic mean , median , standard deviation , categorical variable present proportion 95 % confidence interval . Inferential comparison perform Student 's test Mann-Whitney U test , accord distribution data ( normal abnormal ) determine Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Either chi square test Fisher 's exact test perform evaluate significance among categorical variable . Statistic significance determine p &lt; 0.05 value two- tail test . Both significant variable variable borderline significance ( p &lt; 0.1 ) include multivariate logistic regression analysis . Comparisons group carry log-rank test .</detailed_description>
