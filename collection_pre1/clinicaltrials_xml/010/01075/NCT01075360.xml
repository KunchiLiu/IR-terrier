	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma ( NB ) common malignant tumor infancy . Approximately 60 % NB patient clinically diagnose stage IV disease poor prognosis 5-year survival rate 30 % . Molecular marker NB great impact tumor behavior . MYCN amplification well-known marker predict poor outcome NB patient . However , MYCN affect NB cell behavior remain unknown . In preliminary study , perform genome-wide analysis differential gene expression 10 NB tumor MYCN amplification 10 normal MYCN copy number . We find aromatic hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) reversely correlate MYCN expression . This relationship verify 83 NB tumor sample . In addition , positive AHR expression immunostaining NB tumor predict favorable prognosis . These line evidence demonstrate AHR relate MYCN expression also play important role tumorigenesis NB . Therefore project aim study relationship AHR MYCN . In addition , possible role AHR tumorigenesis NB clarify . Specifically , propose 3-year project follow three aim : Aim I . Determine molecular relationship AHR MYCN expression . AHR show suppress E2F1 expression . E2F1 reversely find upregulate expression MYCN . In preliminary microarray study , also find expression E2F1 positively correlate MYCN expression inversely correlate expression AHR . Therefore , NB cell transfected AHR expression vector AHR siRNA , associate E2F1 MYCN expression examine clarify AHR could regulate MYCN expression via E2F1 . Furthermore , E2F1 level also manipulate determine effect AHR MYCN depend E2F1 . In addition , E2F1 expression NB tumor sample also examine clarify vivo role . Aim II . Determine effect AHR expression NB cell behavior . The baseline AHR expression level several NB cell line examine . AHR overexpressed gene transfection NB cell . The cell proliferation , migration , differentiation AHR overexpression evaluate . Furthermore AHR expression normal neuron cell also examine , suppress siRNA downregulation AHR could lead cancer development . Aim III . Determine AHR could target gene therapy NB . NB cell either normal MYCN MYCN amplification AHR gene transfection inoculate nude mouse demonstrate effect AHR expression NB cell behavior vivo . AHR transfected wild type NB tumor see tumor growth could suppress AHR expression . Then wild type tumor tumor transfected AHR subject microarray analysis compare human tumor data set evaluation gene expression change along differential AHR expression . Altogether , study establish relationship AHR MYCN , also allow u depict functional role AHR-MYCN interaction tumorigenesis NB .</brief_summary>
