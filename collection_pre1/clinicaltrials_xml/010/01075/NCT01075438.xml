	<brief_summary>Ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) rare genetic disorder characterize gait disorder , neuromotor dysfunction , eye abnormality immune deficiency . AT patient vulnerable cancer infection usually die 2nd 3rd decade due complication . The main cause death respiratory infection patient know severe type immunodeficiency . Consequently , pneumonia common infection see AT patient , usually cause S. pneumoniae . Therefore , routine schedule pneumococcal vaccine highly recommend AT case immunoglobulin replacement therapy already initiate . Until recently , AT patient immunized pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 , Pneumovax速 Aventis Pasteur MSD ) . However , data show respond well vaccine . Recently , Israeli Ministry Health approve pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine ( PCV7 , Prevenar速 , Wyeth Lederle ) AT patient age . This conjugate vaccine know stimulate immune system different mechanism response expect high . The approved Israeli schedule immunization AT patient include child old 2 year entitle receive 2 dos PCV7 ( 8 week apart ) boost PPV23 , eight week second dose PCV7 . Assessment antibody response pneumococcal vaccination protocol AT patient never perform . The `` Safra '' Children 's Hospital national multi-disciplinary center care AT patient . Approximately 50 patient country ( include Jewish , Druze , Bedouin Muslim patient - 3 Palestinians ) follow clinic monthly basis . Approximately 20 AT patient receive IVIG replacement therapy , therefore entitle receive pneumococcal vaccination state ( mean age 10.6 , 3 -23 year , 3 less 5 year ) The aim study evaluate responsiveness , determine specific antibody production , AT patient receive new vaccine protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) rare progressive neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disorder characterize cerebellar ataxia , neuromotor dysfunction , oculocutaneous telangiectasia immunodeficiency . AT patient vulnerable cancer infection usually die 2nd 3rd decade due complication . Life expectancy correlate well severity neurological impairment . The main cause death respiratory infection patient know severe type immunodeficiency . The immunodeficiency AT patient consist humoral defect ( immunoglobulin deficiency reduce response polysaccharide antigen ) cell-mediated defect ( reduce lymphocytes number function ) . Consequently , pneumonia common infection see AT patient , usually cause S. pneumoniae . Therefore , routine schedule pneumococcal vaccine highly recommend AT case immunoglobulin replacement therapy already initiate . Until recently , AT patient immunized pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 , Pneumovax速 Aventis Pasteur MSD ) . However , data show respond well vaccine mainly reduce response polysaccharide stimulation . Recently , Israeli Ministry Health approve pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine ( PCV7 , Prevenar速 , Wyeth Lederle ) AT patient age . In contrast polysaccharide vaccine , conjugate vaccine know stimulate immune system T-cell dependent mechanism , therefore response expect high . The approved Israeli schedule immunization AT patient include child old 2 year entitle receive 2 dos PCV7 ( 8 week apart ) boost PPV23 , eight week second dose PCV7 . Assessment immunogenicity pneumococcal vaccination protocol AT patient never perform . The `` Safra '' Children 's Hospital national multi-disciplinary center care AT patient . Approximately 50 patient country ( include Jewish , Druze , Bedouin Muslim patient - 3 Palestinians ) follow clinic monthly basis . Approximately 20 AT patient receive IVIG replacement therapy , therefore entitle receive pneumococcal vaccination state ( mean age 10.6 , 3 -23 year , 3 less 5 year . The aim study evaluate responsiveness , determine specific antibody production , AT patient receive new vaccine protocol recently approve use Israeli Ministry Health .</detailed_description>
