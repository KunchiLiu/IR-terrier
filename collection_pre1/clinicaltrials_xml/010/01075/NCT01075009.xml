	<brief_summary>Antibiotic resistance gram-negative bacteria continue increase US hospital . This come time new drug development active resistant organism . The implication must learn use drug wisely develop new strategy preserve exist agent . Antimicrobial `` stewardship '' program one strategy many hospital adopt improve quality antimicrobial use . The goal project develop consortium US academic medical center allow characterization relationship antibiotic use rate resistance gram-negative pathogen , help hospital devise new strategy modify antibiotic use possibly delay reduce resistance . The specific hypothesis : - Hospitals establish emerge resistance gram-negative pathogen , include extend spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) produce organisms , carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae ( CRE ) carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa different pattern antimicrobial drug use compare hospital few organism . - Hospital use ertapenem associate rate carbapenem-resistant organism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antibacterial drug use Systemic antibacterial drug use adult inpatient discharge January 1 , 2006 December 31 , 2010 obtain patient-level billing record . These data aggregate reported hospital day therapy per 1000 patient day ( DOT/1000PD ) previously describe [ 10 ] . Any dose antibiotic receive patient 24 hour period count one DOT . For example , administration imipenem/cilastatin 1000 mg every 8 hour , administration 500mg every 6 hour , count one DOT . We recently report advantage measure antibiotic use DOTs versus metric usually recommend , Defined Daily Dose ( DDD ) [ 12 ] . Antimicrobial susceptibility In year 2009 request annual cumulative hospital antibiograms 50 hospital year carbapenem drug use . The contact hospital usually antimicrobial stewardship pharmacist , may also include infectious disease physician ( ) , clinical microbiologist infection control practitioner . We utilized antibiograms full calendar year susceptibility report clinical isolates ( least 30 isolates ) , total number isolates proportion resistant isolates . All hospital receive on-line survey request additional information regard susceptibility test method antibiogram construction . We use secure survey instrument provide REDCap ( Research electronic data capture ; www.project-redcap.com ) send compile survey response . Specifically inquired inclusion/exclusion duplicate clinical isolates antibiogram , method ( ) susceptibility test , policy regard surveillance culture attempt verify Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) interpretative breakpoints use year . As recommended Schwaber record proportion rate carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa [ 13 ] . The resistant proportion number resistant isolates divide total number isolates , resistant incidence rate number resistant isolates per 1000 adult patient day ( PD ) .</detailed_description>
