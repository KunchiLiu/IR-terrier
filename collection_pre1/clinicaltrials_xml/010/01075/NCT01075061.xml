	<brief_summary>Mirror movement involuntary , symmetrical simultaneous movement occur one side body accompany controlateral voluntary movement . Congenital mirror movement ( CMM ) characterize childhood onset absence additional manifestation . The aim study unravel pathophysiology CMM remain poorly elucidate . The combination image study neurophysiological study use transcranial magnetic stimulation homogeneous relatively large group patient likely allow u good understand underlie pathophysiology disorder . Using linkage analysis approach try identify locus associate CMM related candidate gene .</brief_summary>
