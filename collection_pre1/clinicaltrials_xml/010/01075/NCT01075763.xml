	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease characterize progressive cognitive impairment result neuronal loss . The primary pathological feature disease extracellular deposition fibrillary amyloid compaction senile plaque . The senile plaque focus complex cellular reaction involve activation microglia astrocytes adjacent amyloid plaque . In fact , microglia abundant prominent cellular component associate plaque . Plaque-associated microglia exhibit reactive activate phenotype . Through acquisition reactive phenotype , microglia respond various stimulus , evident increase expression numerous cell-surface molecule , include major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class-II antigen complement receptor . Traditionally , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) consider `` demyelinate '' disease . Recent immunocytochemical study suggest MS may demyelinate disorder , even early stage disease , MS pathological scenario envisage axonal damage . Interferons , modern therapeutic strategy treatment MS , cytokines - protein lead network signal within different cell . In immune system , IFNs act different level . For example , IFNs increase expression MHC class II antigens , thereby , facilitate antigen-presenting process activation lymphocytes . T-lymphocytes important target IFN immunomodulation . In MS , believe IFN beta suppresses production proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ TNF-α , increase production immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) IL-10 . Since activation microglia astrocytes common AD MS , IFN beta could therapeutic application treatment AD . Furthermore , recent study also find astrocyte production , IFNs promote activation nerve-growth factor . OBJECTIVES - To evaluate safety , tolerability clinical efficacy IFN beta-1a ( Rebif® 22 mcg , tiw ) treatment AD In study , subject randomize two group : first group ( treatment arm , n=20 ) receive Rebif® 22 mcg tiw ; second group ( placebo arm , n=20 ) receive placebo . The treatment period 28 week subject follow Week 52 . Efficacy determine compare neuropsychological performance change placebo treatment arm screening/baseline Week 52 . On Day 1 study treatment period , subject receive injection training administer first dose Rebif supervision clinical personnel subcutaneous injection tiw approximately time day preferably late afternoon evening . All subject receive 28 week therapy 24 week therapy conclusion , termination visit conduct .</detailed_description>
