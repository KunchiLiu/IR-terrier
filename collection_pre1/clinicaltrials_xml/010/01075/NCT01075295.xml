	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether individual psychotic spectrum disorder ( Schizophrenia , Schizoaffective disorder , Schizophreniform Disorder , Bipolar Disorder ( Type I ) , Bipolar Disorder ( Type II ) , Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features , Substance-Induced Psychoses , Psychosis Not-Otherwise-Specified ( NOS ) randomly assign step behavioral intervention prevention weight gain experience less weight gain individual receive usual care . There several study examine effect pharmacological non-pharmacological behavioural approach weight loss patient psychosis , however study examine strategy prevention obesity lack . This study important novel approach study problem obesity psychosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Weight Gain Early Psychoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate obesity relate co-morbidities several-fold high patient psychosis general population . In addition life expectancy 20 % shorter . Several lifestyle illness-related factor implicate high rate , include weight gain associate treatment novel antipsychotic . The important cause death psychosis patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , obesity major risk factor . As well , diabetes associate complication occur high rate person psychosis , diabetes related obesity independent risk factor CVD mortality . It therefore seem reasonable assume prevention obesity may lead reduce risk CVD diabetes . If propose intervention prove successful prevent weight gain reduce risk CVD diabetes , quality length life person psychosis vastly improve medical cost reduce . Specifically , hypothesize : 1a ) small proportion intervention gain weight ( 2 % ) compare receive usual care , 1b ) mean weight gain randomize intervention less mean weight gain randomize usual care 2 ) Increases Body Mass Index ( BMI ) waist circumference ( WC ) small intervention group compare control . 3 ) small increase cholesterol , triglyceride , blood glucose insulin level intervention group control group . Exploratory analyse change maker systemic inflammation , relationship weight , lipid change , conduct develop novel hypotheses regard mediator CVD risk psychosis . The study recruit sixty person outpatient DSM-lV Psychosis BMI &lt; 30 kg/mÂ² , treat less 2 year ( Early SZ ) meet enrollment criterion . They randomly assign allocation ratio 1:1 either get stepped behavioural intervention prevention weight gain ( n=30 ) treatment usual ( routine care , n=30 ) . This pragmatic clinical trial 16-week duration .</detailed_description>
