	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer common disease worldwide . Increasing evidence demonstrate colorectal cancer arise 'cancer stem cell . ' Stem cell colon reside bottom thousand microscopic crypt throughout wall colon . They create cell line bowel wall . These cell create base crypt ascend top acquire characteristic mature cell bowel wall ascend . It think colorectal cancer cell arise stem cell genetic material regulating growth division stem cell become defective . This lead unregulated production cell turn defective genetic information cancer formation . Prior study demonstrate early change cancer develop change cellular proliferation . Now reliable marker identify stem cell find , researcher aim investigate stem cell number change distribution normal risk colorectal cancer high risk . The researcher hypothesise change cellular proliferation top crypt individual high risk colorectal cancer due change number stem cell crypt base .</brief_summary>
