	<detailed_description>Postoperative analgesia major abdominal surgery manage intravenous PCA ( patient control analgesia ) morphine associate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAD ) paracetamol first 48 hour postoperative phase . With multimodal approach patient undergoing colorectal surgery median pain score verbal scale ( 0-10 ) 3 ( range 0-8 ) mean morphine consumption 54 mg ( SD 24 mg ) patient undergo hepatic surgery median pain score 2 ( range 0-7 ) mean morphine consumption 28 mg ( SD 17 mg ) . Although opiates potent analgesic also produce side effect numerous study demonstrate significant reduction morbidity patient receive low dose opiate anesthesia postoperative period . Continuous infusion local anesthetic surgical wound use pain control different type surgery . However , controversial report report abdominal surgery . We conduct prospective , randomise double-blind placebo control trial two surgical model ( colo-rectal oncologic surgery hepatic resection ) use continuous perfusion ropivacaine 0.38 % surgical wound versus saline . Anesthetic protocol patient . Patients undergo colo-rectal surgery operate either laparotomy laparoscopic technique therefore patient stratify four group surgical closure begin : - Group A1 ropivacaine laparotomy - Group A2 ropivacaine laparoscopy - Group B1 saline laparotomy - Group B2 saline laparoscopy In preanesthesia visit patient match inclusion criterion invite participate study sign informed consent . When patient theatre nurse involve management patient open closed envelope indicate solution prepare accord assign group . The surgeon insert multiperforated catheter subfascial level surgical wound , suture muscular fascia ( peritoneum muscular fascia ) surgeon finish subcutaneous plane skin . After closure bolus 5 ml ( laparoscopy colon surgery ) 10 ml ( laparotomy colon hepatic surgery ) solution give catheter subsequently elastomer fill ropivacaine saline connect . The catheter fix skin steri-strip sterile dressing . During procedure administer protocol basis NSAD thirty minute end surgery administer morphine . In postoperative period patient receive NSAD regime PCA morphine treatment . The catheter withdraw 48 hour also PCA analgesic treatment NSAD .</detailed_description>
