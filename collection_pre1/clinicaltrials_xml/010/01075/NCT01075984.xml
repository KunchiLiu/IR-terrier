	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect pharmacokinetic ( PK ) information relate well intravenous Posaconazole ( POS IV ) , distribute body determine safety tolerability new formulation . In addition , PK , safety , tolerability switch take POS IV take Posaconazole Oral Suspension ( POS Oral ) evaluate . The data collect study compare data collect previous study . Individuals diagnose physician blood disease cancer affect infection-fighting white blood cell ask participate trial . Since blood disease treatment weaken immune system , may put individual high risk get serious fungal infection internal organ blood ( invasive fungal infection ) . As fungal infection hard detect early life-threatening , many physician believe individual diagnose disease receive antifungal therapy try low risk get type infection . Enrollment study take place several stage ( cohort ) . The determination cohort individual ask participate base cohort open site time individual approach consider study participation .</brief_summary>
