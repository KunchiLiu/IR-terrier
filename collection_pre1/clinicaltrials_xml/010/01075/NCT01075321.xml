	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Everolimus may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Lenalidomide may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Giving everolimus together lenalidomide may effective treatment lymphoma . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose give everolimus lenalidomide together see well work treat patient relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose RAD001 lenalidomide subject relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin Lymphoma . ( Phase I ) II . To assess tumor response RAD001 lenalidomide subject relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin Lymphoma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival , progression-free survival , duration response , time treatment failure subject receive RAD001 lenalidomide . II . To describe adverse event profile ( use CTCAE CTEP Active Version ) RAD001 lenalidomide . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral everolimus daily oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
