	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia ( SCH ) devastate brain disorder grave personal , family social cost . SCH complex heterogeneous ( genetic clinical ) disorder oligogenetic endow vulnerability risk disease , manifest clinical syndrome comprise positive , negative cognitive symptom late adolescent young adulthood interaction environmental stress . The fact positive psychotic symptom well control dopamine-blocking antipsychotic substantiates dopamine hyperactivity pathophysiological model SCH positive symptom . This dopamine model SCH . The presence negative cognitive symptom fully explain dopamine model . The hypo-glutaminergic function hypothesize replace supplement dopamine pathological model . The hypo-glutaminergic state due neurodevelopmental disturbance early-stage life , coin pathophysiological mechanism SCH . The neurodevelopmental disturbance support hypo-glutamine model base cytoarchitecture abnormality glutamate-pyramidal cell reduce gray matter volume . We find potential vulnerability gene DISC1 NRG1 Taiwanese SCH family sample . These two gene function neurodevelopmental process . Besides , , investigator , also find two vulnerability gene DRD2 receptor gene COMT gene Taiwanese SCH family . The dopamine neurotransmission disturbance could another pathophysiological mechanism SCH . With awareness confound variable antipsychotic treatment response reveal pharmacogenetic study , drug metabolism relate gene plasma HVA level , intend test etiological genetic hypothesis antipsychotic treatment response : ( 1 ) The group neurodevelopmental etiology risk variation DISC1 NRG1 gene poor treatment response group ; ( 2 ) The group pure hyperdopamine etiology risk variation DRD2 receptor COMT gene good treatment group . The potential treatment response related biomarkers , directly indirectly induced etiological risk genetic variation , examine . These potential biomarkers include homovanillic acid ( HVA ) , glutamate , serotonin , cytokine , signal protein , neurocognitive function , event-related evoked potential , Niacin skin test , AKT1 level peripheral lymphocyte . After obtain informed consult , 'll recruit 30 drug-naïve early schizophrenia ( first episode prodromal stage ) patient pre-treatment post-treatment assessment treatment response use positive negative syndrome scale ( PANSS ) , change biomarkers ( include biochemical , electro-physiological neuro-cognitive variable ) , brain imaging ( study component Project No.2 Integrated Program ) PET , fMRI , MRI , DSI MRS ( please refer Project No.2 ) addition genotyping DISC1 , NRG1 , DRD2 COMT gene . The treatment agent dopamine stabilize agent ( aripiprazole , 15mg/day 4 week ) take advantage dopamine activity balance effect . Besides , 'll recruit 30 normal control match age , gender , education , receive genotyping evaluation biomarker variable , brain imaging study . In order adequate statistical power genetic analysis 17 SNP variation 4 vulnerability gene DISC1 , NRG1 , DRD2 , COMT , 'll recruit 200 case schizophrenia duration illness le 5 year , receive regular clinical follow good compliance medication . The treatment response evaluate use PANSS . These case also receive biomarker examination genotyping study . For comparison , 'll also recruit 100 normal control study . We 'll delineate heterogeneity issue schizophrenia use genetic variation , neurobiological biomarkers . This study result beneficial understanding pathogenesis SCH , develop well treatment prevention method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project use early stage drug naïve schizophrenic patient study subject . The specific aim : 1 . To test hypothesis patient group good antipsychotic treatment response mainly carry risk polymorphism DRD2 COMT gene ( dopamine transmission gene ) group poor antipsychotic treatment response mainly carry risk polymorphism DISC1 NRG1 gene ( neurodevelopmental gene ) . This association control polymorphism gene drug metabolize enzyme . 2 . The good vs. poor treatment response group different manifestation pattern biomarkers directly indirectly relate neurodevelopmental dopamine neurotransmission gene . These potential biomarkers include biochemical parameter , electrophysiological neurocognitive indicator . 3 . The good vs. poor responder group differential change response-related biomarkers compare pre-treatment post-treatment status special sub-sample drug-naïve early schizophrenia patient .</detailed_description>
