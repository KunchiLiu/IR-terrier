	<brief_summary>Ixabepilone add significantly antitumor effectiveness capecitabine ER+ triple negative breast cancer . Ixabepilone substantial antitumor activity taxane-refractory patient novel combination need poor prognosis population . Carboplatin combination gemcitabine paclitaxel activity metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) ; also demonstrate activity gemcitabine/carboplatin combination ER+ versus triple negative subset . A Phase I study ixabepilone plus carboplatin solid tumor patient demonstrate safety combination dose schedule propose Phase II trial ( BMS data file ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone + Carboplatin Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open label , nonrandomized , parallel , noncomparative , study 2 group ( stratify ) . All patient receive ixabepilone 20 mg/m2 Days 1 8 carboplatin AUC=2.5 Days 1 8 21-day cycle . Patients stratify either hormone receptor positive [ ER+/PR+/HER2- , ER+/PR-/HER2- , ER-/PR+/HER2- ] - ( n=50 ) triple negative ER-/PR-/HER2- ( n=53 ) . If one group fulfill accrual goal first , registration stratum stop patient meet stratification requirement group register .</detailed_description>
