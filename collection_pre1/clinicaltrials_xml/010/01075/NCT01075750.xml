	<brief_summary>In study want show choice balance type fluid solution perioperative fluid management patient receive cadaveric renal transplantation result less occurrence intra- postoperative hyperkalemia , thus need postoperative dialysis . Additionally , aim determine whether use balance infusion solution lead less occurrence metabolic acidosis electrolyte disorder use isotonic saline . Furthermore want evaluate whether perioperative fluid management balance infusion solution result high frequency primary graft function administration isotonic saline . We test hypothesis use `` Elomel isoton '' ( Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH ) balance infusion solution result less occurrence hyperkalemia consequent post-transplant dialysis , less occurrence metabolic acidosis , decrease incidence electrolyte disorder higher incidence primary graft function compare isotonic saline perioperative fluid management patient receive cadaveric renal transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perioperative Fluid Management Patients Receiving Cadaveric Renal Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Kidney transplantation treatment choice patient end-stage-renal-disease ( ESRD ) . Successful renal transplantation improve quality life reduces mortality eligible patient compare hemodialysis . In 2007 , 44 kidney transplantation per million resident perform Austria . The number patient renal transplant continuously rise last ten year . 398 kidney transplantation perform Austria 2007 , 61 living donor . This underlines special role cadaveric kidney transplantation Austria . Several study demonstrate adequate intraoperative fluid administration associate earlier onset graft function improve graft survival renal transplant recipient . However , kind solution choose perioperative fluid management renal transplant recipient remain clarified . A non-governmental US survey show normal saline commonly use fluid renal transplantation . The common cite reason administration normal saline lack potassium solution . Balanced salt type fluid use less 10 % kidney transplantation . To knowledge three study compare effect lactate ringer 's solution versus normal saline kidney transplantation . Taken together , application lactate ringer 's solution lead less occurrence metabolic acidosis , electrolyte derangement one study , appearance hyperkalemia eliminate use lactated ringer 's instead normal saline . However , also show administration lactate ringer 's kidney transplantation lead significant rise lactate level compare treat normal salin . Despite knowledge lactate ringer 's least potentially lead rise lactate level , study use acetate base balanced salt type fluid perform far cadaveric renal transplantation . We therefore propose prospective study patient undergo cadaveric kidney transplantation randomize receive either solely acetate buffer balanced salt type fluid normal saline infusion therapy . Clinical consideration Postoperative hyperkalemia common problem patient receive cadaveric renal transplantation , especially primary graft function occur . Due acidify effect isotonic saline infusion via generation hyperchloremic acidosis and/or dilutional acidosis , rise serum potassium boost . However , today isotonic saline commonly use infusion solution perioperative period renal transplantation . The use balance infusion solution , contain metabolizable anion , acetate , could result less metabolic acidosis therefore decrease need post-transplant dialysis . Moreover , since balance infusion solution far low chloride content isotonic saline , adverse effect rise serum chloride renal perfusion could avoid . This could ultimately result improved graft function . Preliminary study O'Malley et al . compare effect lactate Ringer 's isotonic saline 51 renal transplant patient . 48 patient receive live donor transplantation 3 receive cadaveric renal transplantation . 26 patient receive isotonic saline 25 lactate Ringer 's . 19 % patient receive isotonic saline reach postassium concentration &gt; 6mmol/L require treatment versus 0 % lactate Ringer 's group . 31 % patient isotonic saline group versus 0 % lactate Ringer 's group require treatment metabolic acidosis . No effect primary graft function could show . Hadimioglu et al . randomized patient undergo living-related kidney transplantation three group receive either isotonic saline , lactate Ringer 's Plasmalyte ( balance infusion solution use acetate gluconate ) . No effect potassium level could show study . Patients receive isotonic saline show significant decrease pH , base excess significant rise serum chloride . In lactated Ringer 's group lactate level increase significantly . The study show difference need postoperative dialysis . Khajavi et al . randomized patient undergo kidney transplantation either normal saline lactate Ringer 's . The author notice high incidence hyperkalemia acidosis isotonic saline group 2 patient lactate Ringer 's group lose kidney due vascular graft thrombosis .</detailed_description>
