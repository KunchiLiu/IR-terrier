	<detailed_description>A Pilot Phase II Study The primary objective study : - To test reproducibility [ F-18 ] HX-4 uptake tumor image patient sequential day test-retest protocol - To test confirm relationship hypoxia tumor measure hypoxia relate biomarkers ( HIF1α CA-IX ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) regional [ F-18 HX-4 ] uptake tumor PET/CT . The secondary objective study : - To continue safety evaluation collection safety data patient - To establish threshold hypoxia uptake [ F- 18 ] HX4 PET image - To collect data test [ F-18 ] HX4 PET image predictor response subgroup patient receive treatment - To gain experience [ F-18 ] HX4 PET/CT order improve study design conduct future study Design : An open label , non-randomized , uncontrolled , single group assignment , pilot efficacy study Procedures : Informed consent , collection demographic information , medical history , blood lab , physical examination , vital sign , ECGs , two three set [ F-18 ] HX4 dose image scan include two pretreatment , one mid-treatment [ F-18 ] HX4 tumor/background ratio ≥ 1.3 pre-treatment scan , one pre-treatment [ F-18 ] FDG , one mid-treatment [ F- 18 ] HX4 tumor/background ratio ≥1.3 pre-treatment scan , concomitant medication collection , adverse event monitoring , assessment tumor response treatment Patients : Approximately forty ( 40 ) patient diagnosis confirm histopathological examination tumor tissue head/neck , lung , liver , rectal cervical cancer receive chemotherapy , radiation therapy chemoradiotherapy . This allow approximately 30 evaluable patient complete study approximately six site .</detailed_description>
