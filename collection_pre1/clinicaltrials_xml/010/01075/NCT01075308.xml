	<brief_title>SB939 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy , measure PSA response progression-free survival , HDAC inhibitor SB939 patient recurrent metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer . Secondary - To determine objective response response duration patient measurable disease baseline . - To determine tolerability toxicity drug patient . - To determine number circulate tumor cell baseline 6 week ( 12 week patient still study treatment ) . - To explore potential molecular factor predictive response assessment archival prostate tumor tissue . - To explore ERG PTEN expression circulate tumor cell potential prognostic predictive marker response drug . - To determine time PSA time objective progression patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral HDAC Inhibitor SB939 daily day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically correlative study . Blood sample Archival tumor tissue analyze TMPRSS2-ERG fusion PTEN deletion status FISH ; TMPRSS2-ERG fusion RT-PCR ; number circulate tumor cell . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
