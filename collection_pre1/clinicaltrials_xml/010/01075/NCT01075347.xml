In study , plan perform prospective study determine effectiveness topical autologous serum primary treatment corneal epithelial defect patient undergo vitrectomy diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty . All patient enrol study receive corneal epithelial debridement end ocular surgery , namely PPV diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty . The patient group two treatment group . In control group , patient receive conventional postoperative eye drop include topical steroid , antibiotic mydriatic . In experimental group , patient receive topical autologous serum eye drop addition conventional postoperative eye drop . The duration cornea surface completely re-epithelize , incidence corneal complication due delay surface re-epithelization ( e.g . infectious corneal ulcer , corneal melting , sterile corneal ulcer , corneal neovascularization ) , incidence recurrent epithelial break initial epithelization compare two group . Patients undergo PPV diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty compare separately</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate treatment effect autologous serum eye drop promote corneal epithelium wound heal patient receive par plana vitrectomy ( PPV ) diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty . Background : During PPV diabetic retinopathy retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty , removal edematous corneal epithelial layer usually require order obtain good surgical view enhance postoperative epithelial wound heal process . However , delay epithelial healing frequently find patient surgery . In addition , corneal epithelial defect also frequent find diabetic patient PPV even corneal epithelial debridement perform operation . Autologous serum , fluid component full blood blood clotting , contain large variety growth factor , vitamin , immunoglobulin . These epitheliotropic factor think responsible therapeutic effect serum observe ocular surface disorder . The effect serum promote epithelial wound heal well document cell culture system variety epithelial cell type include corneal epithelial cell . Autologous serum eye drop also demonstrate beneficial treatment persistent corneal epithelial defect . In study , plan prospective study determine effectiveness autologous serum tear primary treatment corneal epithelial defect follow vitrectomy diabetic patient penetrate keratoplasty .</detailed_description>
