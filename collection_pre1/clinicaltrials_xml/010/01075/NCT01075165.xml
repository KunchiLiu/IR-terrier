	<brief_title>Efficacy Spray Silicone Alteration Burn Scar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At study enrollment , patient 's scar evaluate use vascularity category Vancouver Scar Scale . The vascularity rating four item likert scale rate scar normal ( 0 ) , pink ( 1 ) , red ( 2 ) , purple ( 3 ) . Scar height measure use diagnostic ultrasound unit 20MHz transducer.27 Digital photograph take color spectrum scale place next scar . Laser Doppler imaging ( LDI ) use assess scar perfusion region interest determine whether treatment silicone spay result measureable change scar perfusion well establish time course change may expect occur . A spray template create patient use thermoplastic material . It consist three ( 3 ) circle area .785 inch , space one inch apart , section test area . One area treat spray silicone , one area spray spray saline ( serve placebo ) , remain area treat therefore serve control . The order area treat determined use randomized block , computerize allocation develop study statistician . The spray silicone spray saline apply via container conceal content patient allow observe application silicone saline . Although patient blind test area substance apply , blind regard control area receive treatment . The substance apply trained investigator weekday 12-week period ensure method application consistent . Both substance apply distance 1.5 inch surface skin one second period . Patients instructed wash treat area 24 hour apply pressure garment area . The treated area re-evaluated photographed every two week 12 week period . The clinician conducting initial scar evaluation re-evaluations blind scar treatment . Each patient also complete scar assessment scale.28 The patient 's participation study conclude 12 week initial treatment he/she give option continue use spray silicone , resumption/commencement pressure garment use provision another appropriate scar management program . Because burn scar take several month year reach scar maturation phase , patient still candidate alternate scar management program conclusion study see benefit use spray silicone . If time 12-week period clinician determines scar worsening , patient remove study offer another scar management program .</detailed_description>
