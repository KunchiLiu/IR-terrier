	<brief_summary>Robotic assistance thyroid surgery utilize clinically Korea since late 2007 . Robotic thyroidectomy also validate surgical management thyroid gland . Compared endoscopic thyroidectomy , use robot endoscopic approach via axilla provide broad view thyroid bed , albeit lateral , opposed conventional anterior , perspective . The wrist action surgical robot also provide great degree movement afford use simple endoscopic instrument , tremor eliminate . Although several report operative outcome robotic technique appear , prospective trial compare clinical result robotic conventional open thyroidectomy describe . We therefore design prospective trial compare outcome , include postoperative distress patient satisfaction , patient undergo robotic conventional open thyroidectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Distress Cosmetic Outcomes After Open Versus Robotic Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient assessment A prospective study address perioperative outcome postoperative patient discomfort thyroidectomy commence April 2009 currently continue . All patient tell operative technique involve conventional open robotic thyroidectomy , patient subsequently choose preferred surgical procedure , voluntarily agree participate study , provide write informed consent . The study protocol approve Institutional Review Board . Patients include ( ) minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma ≤4 cm diameter , ( b ) papillary thyroid carcinoma ≤2 cm diameter . Exclusion criterion include ( ) previous neck operation ; ( b ) age &lt; 21 &gt; 65 year ; ( c ) prior vocal fold paralysis history voice laryngeal disease require therapy ; ( ) malignancy definite extrathyroid invasion , multiple lateral neck node metastasis , perinodal infiltration metastatic lymph node , distant metastasis ; and/or ( e ) lesion locate thyroid dorsal area ( especially adjacent tracheoesophageal groove ) cause possible injury trachea , esophagus , recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) . The extent thyroid resection determine patient use American Thyroid Association guideline . All patient underwent prophylactic ipsilateral central compartment node dissection ( CCND ; pretracheal , prelaryngeal , paraesophageal ) . Surgical outcomes Surgical outcome include operating time , intraoperative blood loss , number retrieve central lymph node , length hospital stay , postoperative complication . We also assess incidence postoperative seromas hematoma least 3 week postoperatively . Operating time define interval skin incision closure . The drainage extent measure 24 h , drain remove drainage &lt; 30 mL interval . Study patient discharge day drain removal . Mobility vocal cord assess videostrobolaryngoscopic examination , perform preoperatively 1 week 3 month postoperatively . Vocal cord palsy define permanent evidence recovery within 6 month . Postoperative pain cosmetic outcome To evaluate degree postoperative pain , patient give analgesic identical protocol . Patients ask grade postoperative pain neck anterior chest none , slight , slight , moderate , severe , 24 h surgery . At 1 week 3 month surgery , patient ask ( questionnaire ) evaluate presence hyperesthesia paresthesia neck anterior chest , well shoulder discomfort . All patient answer return complete questionnaire . Cosmetic result , include wound appearance complaint , evaluate patient 3 month surgery use verbal response scale five possible response : extremely satisfy , excellent , acceptable , dissatisfied , extremely dissatisfied . Subjective voice swallow evaluation We use Voice Handicap Index-10 ( VHI-10 ) , validate , reliable self-assessment tool measure patient assessment voice quality effect voice quality-of-life , determine frequency voice abnormality . The VHI-10 consist 10 question , response scale minimum 0 ( voice alteration ) maximum 40 ( high voice impairment ) . Swallowing difficulty assess use Swallowing Impairment Index ( SIS-6 ) , self-administered , six-item assessment symptom relate dysphagia validate diagnosis impairment . The score item SIS-6 range minimum 0 ( swallow alteration ) maximum 24 ( high swallow impairment ) . The SIS-6 score also excellent assess non-voice throat symptom , include cough , choke , throat-clearing , occur thyroidectomy . All patient enrol study complete VHI-10 SIS-6 questionnaires surgery 1 week 3 month surgery .</detailed_description>
