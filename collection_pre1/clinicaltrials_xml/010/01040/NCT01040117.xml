	<brief_summary>Balance impairment common disable disturbance people Multiple Sclerosis . The efficacy pharmacotherapy treat balance impairment MS poorly document literature . Although literature deal rehabilitation balance impairment MS scant , preliminary data report show promising result . The present project could positive impact balance gait ability , disability , fear fall , risk fall quality life patient Multiple Sclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Balance impairment one primary cause disability people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . It increase risk fall contributes development fear fall ( FOF ) , vicious cycle lead limitation daily life activity . The imbalance could cause motor sensorial deficit well sensory-motor integration deficit . Despite disability balance disorder cause , literature ' rehabilitation scant . To knowledge two study publish MS balance rehabilitation . The first paper describe case report MS balance rehabilitation use `` Bobath '' approach . The second paper perform preliminary randomized control study describe effectiveness restore balance control reduce risk fall use specific train program aim improve sensory-motor integration people MS . Considering several limitation study , trial warrant assess usefulness specific sensory-motor training balance impairment people MS . The aim randomise control double blinded clinical trial evaluate whether train program consisting exercise perform different sensory conflict condition lead improvement postural stability patient MS . This turn might lead improvement walk ability , autonomy daily life activity quality life people MS . The study include 80 patient ( age &lt; 65 year ) diagnosis MS relapsing remit accord McDonald criterion Expanded Disability Status Scale score≤6.0 . Patients divide 2 group , accord randomization design . The experimental group undergo specific train program aim increase balance ability several sensory conflict condition . The training program consist fifteen 50-minute session 5 week period ( 3 sessions/week ) . The control group undergo conventional neurorehabilitation treatment follow pattern session study group . At recruitment , treatment ( 5 week ) follow-up ( 1 month ) , patient test follow clinical instrumental procedure : Berg Balance Scale , Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale , Fatigue Severity Scale , Postural Transfers evaluation , Multiple Sclerosis Quality Of Life ( MSQOL ) -54 instrument , Sensory Organization Test , GAITRite® System platform stabilometry . Data examine first reassessment group difference . Data second reassessment analyse within group difference . Sample characteristic summarise use descriptive statistic . Due small sample size , non-parametric test apply : Wilcoxon 's signed rank test within group comparison Mann-withney U test group comparison , significance set p=0.05 . Data analyse use SPSS v16 software .</detailed_description>
