	<brief_summary>The study design evaluate predictive diagnostic accuracy SonoMedica 's CardioSond digital electronic stethoscope detection coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient without known disease refer cardiac compute tomography angiography ( CT scan ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Digital Electronic Stethoscope Computed Tomography ( CT ) Angiography Detection Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CardioSond completely noninvasive medical device detects heart sound murmur use ultrasensitive acoustic technology . The CardioSond produce flow micro bruit score use determine likelihood coronary artery disease . The CardioSond exam give patient agree participate study upon sign informed consent form prior administration beta blocker agent / vasodilator part normal cardiac CT angiography protocol . CardioSond data send independent acoustic core lab determine data quality produce flow micro bruit score . CT angiography data analyze staff North Shore University Hospital . A data review panel lead principal investigator examine result CardioSond CT angiography data determine accuracy CardioSond detecting CAD study population large specific patient subgroup .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects undergoing routine screening coronary CT angiography Willingness sign inform consent form Inability provide inform consent form Age le 21 year Any contraindication coronary CT angiography Known atherosclerotic heart disease , include history prior myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary intervention , coronary artery bypass graft surgery establish diagnosis CAD prior Xray CT angiography Supraventricular ventricular arrhythmia would expect affect CTangiography image quality ( e.g. , atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , ventricular tachycardia , bigeminy , trigeminy ) . Patients isolated premature atrial contraction premature ventricular contraction may enroll . Use intravenous vasodilator Any pulmonary condition would create abnormal physical finding would interfere fidelity cardiac sound recording ( e.g. , obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma COPD , audible wheezing ) . Presence audible aortic pulmonic diastolic murmur , tricuspid mitral flow diastolic murmur , continuous murmur</criteria>
