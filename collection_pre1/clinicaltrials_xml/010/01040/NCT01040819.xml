	<detailed_description>Type-2 diabetes mellitus public health concern . According World health organization ( WHO ) , diabetes mellitus affect 180 million people worldwide . Type 2 diabetes mellitus account 80-95 % diabetes case develop country high proportion develop country ( IDF 2006 ) . Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus high risk develop cardiovascular complication . Diabetic patient two four-times likely develope cardiovascular disease . The mortality diabetic patient cardiovascular disease much high non-diabetic matched patient cardiovascular disease . Recently , become apparent anti-diabetic drug effect progression atherosclerosis cardiovascular outcomes . There great need understand potential protective mechanism various anti-diabetic drug order decrease risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . In addition increase insulin sensitivity , Pioglitazone ( PIO ) anti-inflammatory property . Several study suggest PIO decrease serum marker inflammation include C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . However , underlie mechanism anti-inflammatory ( probably anti-atherosclerotic ) effect PIO unknown . We show rat 3-day pretreatment PIO increase myocardial cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX2 ) activity level 6-keto-PGF1a , stable metabolite prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) 15-epi-lipoxin A4 , lipid mediator strong anti-inflammatory property . Prostacyclin inhibit platelet aggregation cause vasodilatation . Increased level 6-keto-PGF1a 15-epi-lipoxin A4 may thus explanation anti-inflammatory anti-atherosclerosis effect PIO . Several clinical study show COX2 inhibition associate increase cardiovascular event . Thus , augment COX2 activity production prostacyclin 15-epi-lipoxin A4 may potential favorable effect . The purpose study test whether PIO therapy associate increase serum and/or urine level 6-keto-PGF1a 15-epi-lipoxin A4 patient diabetes mellitus type 2 .</detailed_description>
