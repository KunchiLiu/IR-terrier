	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine EMD 1201081 combination cetuximab efficient cetuximab alone control cancer . EMD 1201081 immune modulatory oligonucleotide ( IMO ) contain phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide act agonist Toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR9 ) . EMD 1201081 study six clinical trial 170 subject either monotherapy combination chemotherapeutic agent targeted therapy . Two study conduct healthy volunteer . In five study , subject advance solid tumor , renal cell carcinoma , non-small cell lung cancer colorectal cancer treat EMD 1201081 . Two study still ongoing . Future clinical development EMD 1201081 focus colorectal cancer ( CRC ) squamous cell cancer head neck ( SCCHN ) . In Phase 2 study , subject recurrent metastatic squamous cell cancer head neck ( R/M SCCHN ) , treat cetuximab plus EMD 1201081 cetuximab alone . The study conduct multicenter study several European Union ( EU ) member state Unites States . EMD 1201081 combination cetuximab evaluate antitumor activity subject examine effect accept clinical endpoint . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) evaluate subject treat EMD 1201081 plus cetuximab compare cetuximab alone cetuximab-naïve subject R/M SCCHN progress cytotoxic therapy . Cetuximab , approve colorectal cancer SCCHN combination platinum-based chemotherapy SCCHN combination radiotherapy EU , provide investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) study . Commercially available Cetuximab provide United States .</brief_summary>
