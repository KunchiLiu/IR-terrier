	<detailed_description>Cerebrovascular disease third lead cause death Taiwan 2007 . It also important reason disability among elderly adult . Sex hormone well report associate cardiovascular disease risk . Several study show estrogen show beneficial effect cardiovascular system via favorable effect anti-inflammatory effect . Genetic polymorphism estrogen relate gene speculate influence estrogen level count human susceptible risk stroke young adult . In addition , several study show decrease estrogen-induced vascular inflammatory marker include adhesion molecule chemokines might mechanism vascular protection . Recently , novel unique mechanism 17β-Estradiol ( E2 ) anti-inflammatory activity E2 prevent inflammatory gene transcription induce inflammatory agent inhibit NF-κB intracellular transport find . Therefore , propose study explore association genetic polymorphism estrogen-related gene , include estrogen synthesis , metabolizing , receptor gene , NF-κB ischemic stroke young adult .</detailed_description>
