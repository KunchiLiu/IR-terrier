	<brief_summary>Statins class drug give low cholesterol . Although statin consider generally safe , study show 10 % people statins develop muscle-related symptom , fatigue ( tiredness ) , weakness , cramp , pain sometimes lifethreatening muscle breakdown condition know rhabdomyolysis . In , symptom may greatly affect daily activity . One consideration symptom develop patient may underlie problem way muscle use fat produce energy . In patient , muscle able fully utilize fat become tired easily . Fat within muscle also affect body use hormone call insulin , affect blood sugar level . The investigator specifically interested previous statin user determine muscle symptom relate change energy sugar use . We propose enroll patient develop muscle side effect previous statin treatment since discontinue statin treatment . Our aim compare metabolic parameter patient age gender-matched normal individual .</brief_summary>
