	<detailed_description>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , class medication use treatment prevention HIV/AIDS . Analyzing body interacts medication cellular level may lead effective dose strategy HIV prevention treatment . This study examine pharmacokinetics TDF FTC cellular level HIV-infected people ( N=20 ) HIV-uninfected people ( N=20 ) . HIV-infected participant allow take part study doctor already plan prescribe TDF , FTC , efavirenz ( EFV ) HIV care , regardless participation study . HIV-infected participant receive Truvada ( TDF/FTC ) EFV first 30 day . After Day 30 , participant continue receive TDF , FTC , EFV Day 60 , direction physician . HIV-infected participant remain therapy throughout study part HIV care . HIV-uninfected volunteer receive 30 day Truvada ( TDF/FTC ) . The study duration 60 day . Study visit occur baseline Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 20 , 30 , 60 . At study visit , participant undergo blood urine collection pharmacology study , medication history review , adverse effect questionnaire . HIV-uninfected participant also attend two additional study visit Days 35 45 - study medication - blood urine collection , adverse effect questionnaire , medication history review . At vary study visit first 30 day , participant undergo one rectal biopsy , female participant undergo one cervical cell fluid sample procedure , male participant provide one semen sample . In addition collection enrol participant , study researcher also analyze previously collect store blood sample participant `` Chemoprophylaxis HIV Prevention Men ( iPrEx ) '' study , examine use TDF FTC prevention HIV men sex men ( MSM ) .</detailed_description>
