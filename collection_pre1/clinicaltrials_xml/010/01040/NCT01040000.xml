	<brief_summary>The purpose phase 2 component study determine give immune molecule NPC-1C individual cancer pancreas gastrointestinal tract ( colon rectum ) respond standard treatment shrink halt growth cancer , obtain additional data study effect immune system . Safety data also accumulate evaluated study . NPC-1C monoclonal antibody recognize specific tumor target certain cancer . In laboratory study , antibody kill tumor cell colon pancreatic cancer express NPC-1C antigen process call `` antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity '' ADCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QUILT-3.019 : Phase 2 Study NPC-1C Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody Treat Pancreatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The limitation many current therapeutic product pancreatic cancer widely recognize . Despite development several new treatment regimens pancreatic cancer , little benefit appreciate , leave disease one significant unmet medical need cancer . NPC-1C chimeric immunoglobulin molecule comprise variable region heavy chain light chain murine NPC-1 , genetically engineer in-frame constant region human IgG1 isotype . NPC-1 , predecessor NPC-1C , derive Tumor Associated Antigen ( TAA ) base vaccine previously test Phase 1-2 clinical trial perform United States 1980 's explore use TAA therapy patient adenocarcinoma colon . These early study demonstrate safety well preliminary evidence activity patient treat vaccine . NPC-1C antibody-staining study demonstrate specific immunoreactivity cancer tissue colon pancreas patient , whereas weak binding , , observe normal pancreas colon tissue cross-reactivity observe normal human tissue . The Phase 2 portion trial open label , multi-center study estimate treat approximately 30 patient pancreatic cancer fail first line therapy , 43 patient metastatic colorectal cancer refractory standard treatment .</detailed_description>
