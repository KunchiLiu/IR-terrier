	<brief_summary>Regular wound healing follow well-ordered sequence overlap phase : inflammation , proliferation , maturation remodelling . In young , damage organ mostly trigger fully regenerative mechanism call `` primary '' wound healing . Repeated damage young individual may cause `` secondary '' wound heal eg . scar formation reflect rescue program , reorganisation fail . Organ failure age organism characterize progressive loss capability achieve orderly reactivation organ repair , result combination chronic inflammation fibroproliferative , non-regenerative repair affect several organ , include lung , liver skin . RESOLVE 's objective identify , characterize , validate molecular target responsible shift primary organ repair towards fibroproliferative wound heal result age-dependent loss regulatory control . The structured approach base - different form wound healing , - different human diseases - different genetic background , aim provide future diagnostic tool various organ , create transgenic animal test system , identify molecular target involve fibroproliferative wound healing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cutaneous scar frequently encounter condition . The process wound repair , however , complicate , various factor contribute different type scar ( eg . hypertrophic , atrophic ) . WP 2.1 : Regular skin repair In elective plastic surgery excise operative skin specimen usually discard , represent excellent opportunity harvest skin biopsy without additional invasive measure . This work package analyze skin sample individual elective plastic surgery normal wound heal serve control group . WP 2.2 : Skin repair without hypertrophic scar formation A classic example fibroproliferative repair skin hypertrophic scar classify dermal skin lesion , raise skin level , stay within confines initial wound increase size push margin scar without invade surround normal tissue . Hypertrophic scar condition commonly observe burn region prolong wound healing ( &gt; 21 day ) . The underlie pathology hypertrophic scarring , however , poorly understood . Hypertrophic scar manage conservatively , require surgical intervention special circumstance . This work package analyze clinical molecular response standard treatment regimen skin region without hypertrophic scar skin injury . WP 2.4 : Wound heal normal diabetic individual Diabetes mellitus know factor cause impair wound healing . Due microangiopathic , macroangiopathic condition result atherosclerosis peripheral neuropathy wound heal diabetic individual usually delay ( hypotrophic , atrophic ) often complicate immunosuppression superinfection . The rise prevalence diabetes mellitus elderly population make necessary understand related process relevant clinical wound model . Split-thickness skin-grafting commonly apply technique plastic surgery , donor site previously uninjured skin region spontaneously heal within two week , represent ideal condition monitor clinical molecular change diseased vs. non-diseased state . This work package analyze skin repair donor sit split-thickness skin graft non-diabetic diabetic individual .</detailed_description>
