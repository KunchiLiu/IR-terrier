	<brief_summary>The main aim study analyze report preliminary intermediate term outcome laparoscopic revision Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery weight recidivism . The foremost outcome measurement 1 ) Fat loss mainly measure weight loss express trend BMI , % EWL , and/or % EBL ; 2 ) Trend Comorbidity status ; 3 ) Patient satisfaction Health-Related Quality Life `` HR-QoL '' measure standardize , non-validated subjective satisfaction questionnaire validate , disease-specific , Moorehead-Ardelt II QoL questionnaire , respectively ; 4 ) Morbidity &amp; Mortality include nutritional status metabolic complication . Consequently , secondary objective study 1 ) assess failure rate define percentage excess weight loss &lt; 50 % , low BMI &gt; 35 morbidly obese ( MO ) &gt; 40 superobese ( SO ) , and/or lack resolution/improvement major comorbidities point time assess preliminary intermediate result surgery analysis . 2 ) To evaluate metabolic nutritional status measurement particular clinical biochemical parameter . This research line current provocative new idea recent high impact publication . To best knowledge , first outcome study revisional malabsorptive distal gastric bypass surgery laparoscopy diverse revisional strategy revisional gastroplasty , revisional Fobi-Capella , revisional Adjustable Gastric Band , conversion distal , conversion , long limb gastric bypass . Previously , several study address conversion malabsorptive gastric bypass fail primary proximal gastric bypass none address failed distal gastric bypass adequate balance increase restriction malabsorption decrease risk protein-calorie malnutrition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since 1998 , substantially progressive increase bariatric surgery . In 2005 , American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ( ASMBS ) report 81 % bariatric procedure approach laparoscopically . 205,000 people , 2007 , bariatric surgery United States approximately 80 % Gastric Bypass . Moreover , mismatch eligibility receipt bariatric surgery le 1 % eligible population treat morbid obesity bariatric surgery . Along increase number elective primary weight loss procedure , 20 % post RYGB patient sustain weight loss beyond 2 3 year primary bariatric procedure11 . Thus , revisional surgery poor weight loss re-operations technical mechanical complication rise parallel manner . RYGB consistently consider revisional procedure choice fail restrictive procedure . At present three broad category bariatric procedure accord mechanism action : 1 ) purely restrictive , 2 ) primarily restrictive malabsorption , 3 ) primarily malabsorptive restriction . Modern standard bariatric procedure recognize American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery `` ASMBS '' include follow 1 ) adjustable gastric band , 2 ) sleeve gastrectomy , 3 ) gastric bypass , 4 ) biliopancreatic diversion , 5 ) duodenal switch . In general , lack long-term ( 5-10 year ) long-term ( &gt; 10 year ) outcome study modern bariatric surgery would allow u good define role one procedures , especially advent laparoscopic approach . In animal model , diet induced obese animal exhibit metabolic syndrome underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass highly reproducible surgical outcome well biochemical energetic homeostatic abnormality similar post-RYGB finding human . Weight regain occur approximately 20 % patient two three year RYGB . It seem weight-loss-promoting effect chronically elevate plasma PYY concentration dominate weight-gain-promoting effect lower plasma leptin concentration , relative plasma PYY : leptin concentration ratio determine whether weight loss sustain regain . Several study compare different Roux limb length primary bariatric surgery . It seem long limb RYGB ( 150cm ) , especially patient BMI &gt; 50 kg/m2 , confers least good short-term weight loss without nutritional consequence . Conversely , investigator find clinically significant difference weight loss increase Roux limb length , especially patient BMI &lt; 50 kg/m2 23-26 . The following main investigator increase malabsorptive component fail proximal gastric bypass revisional strategy : 1 . Torres JC 1991 first propose strategy cohort 140 patient follow 5 year ( 90.5 % follow-up rate ) . Analyzed traditional outcome measure early ( 2.1 % ) late ( 27 % ) morbidity include protein-calorie malnutrition ( 7 % ) ; % EWL 1,2,3,4 , 5 year 89.5 % , 91 % , 87 % , 82.5 % , 82.5 % , respectively ; re-operations . 2 . Fox SR Oh KH et al 1996 report 10 fail proximal gastric bypass patient undergoing distal gastric bypass diverse group fail primary surgery ( n=80 ) follow 3 year 92.5 % follow-up rate . Reported traditional outcome measure early ( 39 % ) late ( 84 % ) morbidity ; % EWL 1,2 , &amp; 3 year 83 % , 89 % 94 % , respectively ; high satisfaction also report . 3 . Sugerman et al 1997 publish outcomes 27 patient . Five patient convert malabsortive distal gastric bypass 50cm common channel require second revision malnutrition two die . 22 patient revise 150cm common channel ; three patient require second revision malnutrition % EWL go 30 % 61 % 1 year 69 % 5 year . They conclude 50cm common channel unacceptable morbidity mortality . 4 . Fobi et al 2000 present result 65 patient mostly fail primary Fobi pouch operation . 15 patient develop protein calorie malnutrition require supplemental nutrition 6 require revision . 5 . The 2001 SapalaÂ´s et al partial outcome analysis 303 varied revisionary micropouch gastric bypass procedure 200cm Roux limb , 150cm biliopancreatic limb &gt; 200cm common channel . % EWL 3 year similar primary procedure ( 68.6 % , 76.6 % , 72.3 % ) . However subset analysis perform . 6 . Pareja et al analysis 41 patient , undergo diverse distal malabsorptive technique , include 32 revisionary procedure primary Fobi-Capella gastric bypass . At 11 , 16 , 19 month mean follow-up , % EWL Scopinaro-style , Brolin , Fobi revisionary gastric bypass 69.7 % , 65.0 % , 74.8 % , respectively . Failure success rate accord Biron et al . provide subgroup analysis provide . 7 . Brolin et al 2007 report 47 54 patient undergoing revision fail primary bariatric surgery , long limb gastric bypass 75cm 100cm common channel 15cm 25cm biliopancreatic limb . 7.4 % ( n=4 ) develop protein-calorie malnutrition one require 6 week TPN , two elongation common channel ( 150cm ) one reversal prolong hiatus return severe metabolic complication . 47.9 % series lose least 50 % EWL 1 year . There difference primary fail restrictive vs. primary fail gastric bypass patient . 8 . Sarr et al 2007 state `` patient anatomically intact , non-malabsorptive RYGB convert malabsortive distal RYGB , good result common '' . To best knowledge extensive literature search , outcome study employ laparoscopic approach revisional malabsorptive distal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass specially increase restrictive component fail primary malabsorptive distal type gastric bypass . Thus , decide analyze series include learn curve diverse revisional technique unique subset patient : 1 ) revision gastroplasty ; 2 ) Fobi-Capella ( static band ) ; 3 ) Adjustable gastric band ; 4 ) Conversion either modality malabsorptive distal gastric bypass , , long limb distal . Summarizing , lack very-long term outcome bariatric surgery standardization gastric bypass surgery . The treatment inadequate weight loss weight recidivism Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) remain refractory medical treatment . Failure rate report 20 % 35 % morbidly obese super obese , respectively 2 3 year surgery . The indication surgical intervention remain controversial , type procedure recommend . Furthermore , standardization limb length , pouch size use prosthetic reinforcement . Therefore approach patient must individualize original operation . We analyze experience laparoscopic approach complex challenging patient .</detailed_description>
