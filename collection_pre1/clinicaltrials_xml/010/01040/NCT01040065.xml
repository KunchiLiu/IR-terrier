	<brief_title>Distal Clavicle Resection With Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , acromioclavicular joint syndrome rarely cause hospital visit , need treatment even rarer . In comparison , patient suffer rotator cuff tear accompany shoulder impingement syndrome often complain acromioclavicular joint pain . However , often patient complain severe pain positive finding X-ray MRI , sign impingement . On hand , patient positive finding X-ray MRI little pain . Even patient out-patient-department complain acromioclavicular joint pain pressure may feel pain pressure physical exam perform rotator cuff tear surgery . The opposite frequent well , often different depend time performer . In literature , author maintain distal clavicular resection must do surgery use treat impingement syndrome , hand , endorse complaining ( operation trim distal clavicle protrude part adjust plane acromion order level plane ) , also propose none approach either perform distal clavicular resection . Thus , vary opinion depend author ; moreover , observational study , none report rotator cuff tear injury . The author study hypothesize prove since osteoarthritic change pain acromioclavicular joint secondary impingement syndrome , distal clavicular resection rotator cuff repair surgery long term effect .</detailed_description>
