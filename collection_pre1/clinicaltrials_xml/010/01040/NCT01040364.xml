	<detailed_description>The main goal study describe analyze trend incidence rate internal hernia presentation different modification mesenteric closure technique Primary Laparoscopic RYGB Surgery 1997 2009 . Secondary study aim describe follow point 1 . Clinical presentation , whether acute ( small bowel obstruction ) , chronic ( intermittent abdominal pain ) , incidental find - ( asymptomatic ) ; 2 . Preoperative image study . The percentage patient underwent preoperative CT/contrast study well percentage patient positive , undetermined , normal result ; 3 . Site internal herniation include transverse mesocolon , jejunal mesentery , Peterson 's space well single vs. multiple internal hernia . This study along exist literature allow u formulate preliminary clinical recommendation . This research line current provocative new idea recent high impact publication . Most literature point towards antecolic rout Roux limb decrease incidence rate internal hernia formation . However , study demonstrate statistically clinically significant decrement internal hernia formation improvement closure technique retrocolic antegastric rout Roux limb . The epidemic overweight obesity United States America along comorbidities continue expand . Bariatric surgery demonstrate effective sustained method control severe obesity comorbidities . For instance , type 2 diabetes mellitus completely resolve 76.8 percent , systemic arterial hypertension resolve 61.7 percent , dyslipidemia improve 70 percent , obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome resolve 85.7 percent . Furthermore , bariatric surgery significantly increase life expectancy ( 89 percent ) decrease overall mortality ( 30 40 percent ) , particularly deaths diabetes , heart disease , cancer . Lastly , preliminary evidence downstream saving associate bariatric surgery offset initial cost 2 4 year . Since 1998 , substantially progressive increase bariatric surgery . In 2005 , American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery `` ASMBS '' report 81 percent bariatric procedure approach laparoscopically . 205,000 people , 2007 , bariatric surgery United States approximately 80 percentage Gastric Bypass . Moreover , mismatch eligibility receipt bariatric surgery le 1 % eligible population treat morbid obesity bariatric surgery10 . Along increase number elective primary weight loss procedure , 20 percent post RYGB patient sustain weight loss beyond 2 3 year primary bariatric procedure11 . Thus , revisional surgery poor weight loss reoperations technical mechanical complication rise parallel manner . RYGB consistently consider revisional procedure choice fail restrictive procedure . At present three broad category bariatric procedure accord mechanism action 1. purely restrictive , 2. primarily restrictive malabsorption , 3. primarily malabsorptive restriction . Modern standard bariatric procedure recognize American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery `` ASMBS '' include follow 1. adjustable gastric band , 2. sleeve gastrectomy , 3. gastric bypass , 4. biliopancreatic diversion , 5. duodenal switch . There multi center , randomize , double blind control trial compare different standard bariatric procedure . Gastric bypass old available bariatric procedure ; without randomize controlled trial , consider gold standard procedure United States . Incisional hernia occur high incidence rate open RYGB , approximately 20 percent , whereas laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass `` RYGB '' , incidence rate low . Conversely , Internal hernia rare complication open approach whereas laparoscopic RYGB incidence rate report somewhere 0.2 8.6 percent . The accepted theory due decrease adhesion formation laparoscopic surgery compare open surgery . Other factor associate high incidence internal hernia formation RYGB 1. childbearing age consequent pregnancy RYGB , 2 . Roux limb routing , 3 . Closure mesenteric mesocolic defect . Although randomize controlled trial compare different technique laparoscopic RYGB , several author report low rate modify technique retrocolic antecolic approach . On hand , others support meticulous defect closure important factor reduce hernia formation . The method fixation mesenteric closure evolve . Initially , open approach , defect close . Then , absorbable suture use change interrupted non-absorbable suture . Lastly , continuous non-absorbable material closing defect recommend Sugerman . Summarizing , high level evidence recommend best strategy decrease incidence rate potentially devastate complication internal hernia laparoscopic RYGB . After review literature trend toward low rate internal hernia formation antecolic compare retrocolic , defect closure compare nonclosure . There great variation incidence rate among report series reflect incomplete follow-up factor may affect outcome . With study , analyze trend incidence rate internal hernia formation among different subgroup consecutive series 7,500 laparoscopic retrocolic RYGB hand-sawn gastrojejunostomy . With consecutive series , confirm report small series meticulous closure technique mesocolic/mesenteric defect continuous nonabsorbable material clinically statistically decrease formation rate internal hernia laparoscopic gastric bypass .</detailed_description>
