	<detailed_description>Autism pervasive developmental disorder affect social , communicative , compulsive/repetitive behavior . It also frequently accompany aggression , self-injury , irritability , make care individual significant challenge family institutional setting . Currently risperidone medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) irritability associate autism , although patient respond risperidone able tolerate side effect . As , additional target treatment need explored autism . Neuroimmune disturbance demonstrate patient autism ( Ashwood et al. , 2006 ; DelGuidice , 2003 ) presence neuroinflammation may play role initiate maintain CNS dysfunction characteristic disorder ( Pardo et al , 2005 ) . Therefore , considerable interest use immunomodulatory medication address core associate symptom . Trichuris suis ovum ( TSO ) egg intestinal helminthes induce Th2 cytokine release nonspecifically downregulate Th1 responsiveness ( Summers et al. , 2003 ) . Treatment TSO show beneficial effect autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease ( Summers et al , 2003 ; Summers et al. , 2005a ; Summers et al. , 2005b ) anecdotal report patient autism demonstrate TSO may effective reduce repetitive behavior , aggression , self-injury , impulsivity . To date , many medication use individual autism history psychopharmacology autism notable exaggerated benefit variety treatment . To date , medication study field open-label without use placebo control without systematic behavioral assessment . The current practice prescribe medication patient autism without scientifically demonstrate efficacy underscore necessity methodologically rigorous study conduct . We propose double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial TSO , subject would randomize receive placebo TSO 12 week , 4 week washout 12 week treatment yet receive . To assess effect social cognition , repetitive behavior , aggression irritability , global functioning adult autism spectrum disorder . The objective propose study develop innovative treatment approach autism 1 ) assess safety efficacy TSO treatment use behavioral laboratory outcome measure ; 2 ) determine whether treatment sufficient promise warrant consideration large , multi-centered , placebo-controlled clinical trial ; 3 ) conduct secondary analysis explore relationship clinical feature , immune mechanism , treatment response .</detailed_description>
