Sample size consideration A total 366 couple randomize two arm within stratum define whether first pregnancy . The primary objective test whether arm difference proportion father abstinent smoke 28 week pregnancy ( time 1 ) 12 month post-randomization ( time 2 ) . We expect attrition rate among father 20 % 30 % time 1 time 2 , respectively ; dropout impute non-abstinent intention-to-treat analysis . The chi-square test difference two proportion use test null hypothesis difference abstinence rate two arm . The overall one-sided alpha level control 0.025 conduct test one-sided alpha 0.0125 . Based Nevid colleague ' previous study compare counsel pamphlet , [ Nevid , 1997 ] anticipate abstinence rate 10 % 5 % Guia arm time 1 time 2 , respectively . The alternative hypothesis arm difference time 1 15 % ( 25 % versus 10 % ) time 2 10 % ( 15 % versus 5 % ) . A sample size 366 select least 90 % power alternative hypothesis . For effect time 2 90 % power , effect time 1 overpower 97 % . It assume arm effect 25 % versus 10 % time 1 15 % versus 5 % time 2 consider participant dropout outcomes imputed non-abstinent . Thus , alternative hypothesis , probability response among 80 % 70 % drop ( 31 % versus 13 % ) ( 21 % versus 7 % ) , respectively .</detailed_description>
