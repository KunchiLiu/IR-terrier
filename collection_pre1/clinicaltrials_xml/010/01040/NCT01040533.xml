	<detailed_description>The epidemic overweight obesity United States America along comorbidities continue expand . Bariatric surgery demonstrate effective sustained method control severe obesity comorbidities . For instance , type 2 diabetes mellitus completely resolve 76.8 percent , systemic arterial hypertension resolve 61.7 percent , dyslipidemia improve 70 percent , obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome resolve 85.7 percent . Furthermore , bariatric surgery significantly increase life expectancy ( 89 percent ) decrease overall mortality ( 30 40 percent ) , particularly deaths diabetes , heart disease , cancer . Lastly , preliminary evidence downstream saving associate bariatric surgery offset initial cost 2 4 years8 . Since 1998 , substantially progressive increase bariatric surgery . In 2005 , American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery `` ASMBS '' report 81 percent bariatric procedure approach laparoscopically . 205,000 people , 2007 , bariatric surgery United States approximately 80 percent Gastric Bypass . Moreover , mismatch eligibility receipt bariatric surgery le 1 percent eligible population treat morbid obesity bariatric surgery . Along increase number elective primary weight loss procedure , 20 percent post RYGB patient sustain weight loss beyond 2 3 year primary bariatric procedure . Thus , revisional surgery poor weight loss re-operations technical mechanical complication rise parallel manner . Regardless effective treatment morbid obesity , JIB abandon early 80 mostly metabolic nutritional complication . Multiple patient underwent procedure two decade ago still alive . Close follow-up , even asymptomatic patient , necessary JIB may present nonreversible complication . As bariatric procedure , weight regain , inadequate initial weight loss , late complication combination widely accept indication undergo revisional bariatric surgery . Specifically , JIB relate late complication arbitrarily categorize `` malabsorption malnutrition '' `` bacterial overgrowth syndrome '' . The former might present steatorrhea , electrolyte ( K , Ca , P , Mg ) acid base imbalance ( hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ) , liposoluble ( A , D , E , K ) hydrosoluble ( B1 , B12 Folate ) vitamin deficiency , protein calorie malnutrition `` PCM '' . `` The bacterial overgrowth syndrome '' cause variety complication gas bloat syndrome , foul smell flatulence , recurrent migratory polyarthralgia necrotizing skin lesion . Other late non metabolic complication relate bypassed bowel include intussusception , pseudo-obstruction , bypass enteropathy . `` PCM '' quickly effectively treat parenteral nutritional support . Diet optimization consumption high biological value protein ( 90 g per day ) total calorie intake adjust ideal body weight might decrease severity malabsorption syndrome prevent recurrence . Transitory resolution symptom cause bacterial overgrowth syndrome accomplish administration , divide dos , oral tetracycline ( 2.0 g per day ) , amoxicillin-clavulanate ( 1 1.7g per day ) , clindamycin ( 0.9 1.8 g per day ) , metronidazole ( 1 1.5 g per day ) among others . Rapid symptomatic improvement observe , however , time , organisms become resistant systemic absorption antibiotic , cease benefit therapy . In addition , side effect include superinfection pseudomembranous colitis might present . Local instillation antibiotic intestinal indwelling catheter place excluded bowel limb describe . When JIB relate complication present intractable , severe recurrent , surgical intervention require . Liver , either acute liver failure cirrhosis , ( secondary `` PCM '' bacterial overgrowth syndrome ) kidney , either tubulointerstitial nephropathy renoureteral lithiasis , ( secondary enteric hyperoxaluria volume depletion ) dysfunction frequently describe complication lead death . However , end stage liver ( cirrhosis ) renal disease establish , good judgment need ass risk benefit algorithm operative intervention , condition irreversible . In United States , popular type intestinal bypass perform call `` 14 plus 4 '' end side jejunoileostomy , 14 inch biliopancreatic limb 4 inch common channel . Because poor weight loss , surgeon use performed end end jejunoileostomy avoid chyme reflux defunctionalized limb ; Through ileocolostomy , defunctionalized jejunoileal limb drain cecum sigmoid colon . Open reversal conversion gastric bypass show effective procedure define complication . Since 60 Payne , DeWind Commons already demonstrate takedown restitution gastrointestinal continuity effective strategy solve metabolic complication . However , relapse obesity along comorbidities rule . Series 70 80 suggest one stage open revision JIB gastric bypass feasible safe . However , revision perform couple year original bariatric surgery completely different configuration ( non divide horizontal pouch loop gastrojejunostomy ) modern RYGB perform day . Hence , outcome analysis series transferable today context . Because long interval time JIB revision surgery , bowel adaptation maximal causing mark discrepancy lumen diameter bowel thickness functional defunctionalized bowel segment . Thus , different approach describe literature deal extensive intestinal changes.. Based Cannova et al . report describe placement intestinal indwelling catheter exclude bowel limb , Dallal et al . minimally invasive approach establish enteral nutritional support defunctionalized bowel limb , revert atrophy . After three month period extensive counseling undergo conversion RYGB , patient decide reverse . Another stag option revise JIB follow . Initially , JIB dismantle normal gastrointestinal continuity restore . After initially bypass atrophied small bowel regain function bowel atrophy partially overturn , second stage ( weight loss procedure ) perform , weight loss maintain achieve . The two accept revisionary procedure describe literature fail JIB mainly adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) gastric bypass . In 2000 , O'Brien et al . report series 50 revision adjustable gastric banding . As primary bariatric procedure , two patient JIB . A one stage open revision perform without provide specific subset outcome analysis . In 1993 , Behrns et al . report outcome analysis 61 open assort revision surgery 14 JIB . The indication subgroup due severe metabolic complication pre-revisional mean BMI 34.2 kilogram per square meter . Nine patient revise VBG five patient non-divided , vertical RYGB . The percent excess weight loss five patient 49.5 percent ( overall follow-up 23 month ) 67 percent dissatisfaction rate new lifestyle change eat pattern cause switch full size meal restrict diet . In 1996 , Owens et al . report open surgical revision 75 patient 23 patient JIB primary procedure . Specific subgroup analysis provide . In 2005 , khaitan et al . report 37 patient underwent 39 bariatric revision , either open laparoscopic . Originally , five JI bypass two initially approach laparoscopically . However , specific subgroup analysis provide . In summary , two manuscript report case attempt laparoscopic conversion JIB RYGB modern anatomical construction . However , one stage procedure achieve date . Therefore , outcomes approach document well . With study , advance knowledge revision bariatric surgery report excellent outcome conversion completely malabsorptive procedure mostly restrictive weight loss procedure , gastric bypass although JIB abandon long time ago , still live patient procedure bariatric surgeon need aware side effect minimally invasive strategy management highly complex patient .</detailed_description>
