	<brief_summary>In recent decade , prevalence obesity increase dramatically United States . Obesity associate increase risk metabolic syndrome , characterize cluster metabolic derangement , include insulin resistance , high blood sugar , high triglyceride , low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol level , high blood pressure , inflammation . Lifestyle intervention , include dietary modification , physical activity , weight loss , form basis treatment individual metabolic syndrome . However , optimal composition diet known time . Furthermore , due hormonal metabolic change accompany weight loss , people find difficult maintain significant weight reduction time . As result , weight regain exceedingly common .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isocaloric Dietary Interventions Insulin Resistance Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several dietary pattern , include Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension study diet ( DASH diet ) low glycemic index diet ( low GI diet ) , may useful treatment individual metabolic syndrome , even body weight stay . Novel finding pilot study suggest dietary pattern may improve insulin resistance feature metabolic syndrome , even two week absence weight loss . In important follow-up study , metabolic effect DASH diet low GI diet compare Western-style control diet . At least 39 overweight , insulin-resistant volunteer metabolic syndrome study 32-day inpatient admission . All food provide , body weight kept stable throughout study . Subjects first undergo test consume Western-style diet two week . They randomize one three study diet : DASH diet , low GI diet , Western-style diet . Testing conduct 2 week weight stability study diet . Testing include assessment insulin sensitivity metabolic parameter , blood sugar cholesterol level , blood pressure , inflammation . This study provide important information effect promise dietary pattern feature metabolic syndrome , absence weight loss .</detailed_description>
