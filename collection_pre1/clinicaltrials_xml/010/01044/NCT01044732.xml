	<brief_summary>The Third Eye® Retroscope® device insert instrument channel standard colonoscope provide additional , retrograde ( backward ) view reveals area behind folds flexure colon , might detect additional polyp see colonoscope alone . Patients participate subject study undergo two complete colonoscopy procedure , standard colonoscopy colonoscopy Third Eye Retroscope use along colonoscope . Half patient standard colonoscopy first follow Third Eye colonoscopy , half Third Eye procedure first . Results two group analyze compare determine effectiveness Third Eye Retroscope detect additional adenoma polyp compare standard colonoscope alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy generally agree best method detect remove pre-cancerous polyp , lesion miss , especially locate behind fold line colon behind flexure ( sharp bend ) colon . The Third Eye® Retroscope® device insert instrument channel standard colonoscope provide additional , retrograde ( backward ) view reveals area behind folds flexure colon . Previous study show device effective detect additional polyp could see colonoscope alone . The purpose research compare additional diagnostic yield obtain use Third Eye® Retroscope® vs. diagnostic yield standard colonoscope alone context randomize , control study design . Patients schedule colonoscopy recruit study randomize one two group . Each patient undergo two `` back-to-back '' procedure . Patients Group A ( study group ) undergo standard colonoscopy follow immediately Third Eye colonoscopy . Patients Group B ( control group ) undergo Third Eye colonoscopy follow immediately standard colonoscopy . Results two group analyze compare determine effectiveness Third Eye Retroscope detect additional adenoma polyp compare standard colonoscope alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient undergo colonoscopy screening , surveillance followup previous polypectomy diagnostic workup ; The patient must understand provide write consent procedure . Patients history colonic resection ; Patients inflammatory bowel disease ; Patients personal history polyposis syndrome ; Patients suspect chronic stricture potentially preclude complete colonoscopy ; Patients diverticulitis toxic megacolon ; Patients history radiation therapy abdomen pelvis ; Patients currently enrol another clinical investigation intervention might compromise safety patient 's participation study .</criteria>
