	<brief_title>Levetiracetam Memory Function Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing research focus condition precede clinical diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) order detect patient risk early intervention . One condition mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study group patient report increased activation MTL performance memory task . The functional significance increase activation unclear . One possibility great activity reflect increase effort need order maintain performance , would compensatory response . An alternative possibility increase activation reflect aberrant physiology related disease process would sign great underlie disease severity would interfere brain function . Data animal model suggest possibility low dose levetiracetam ( well-tolerated anti-convulsant ) treatment may reduce observed hyperactivity improve memory performance among individual MCI . We therefore conduct within-subjects trial 8 week duration , involve 144 subject low dose treatment levetiracetam . During course study , subject may receive drug placebo two week , order administer treatment counterbalance . Cognitive test fMRI imaging obtain 2-weeks drug/placebo . The overall goal study determine treatment MCI subject low dose levetiracetam reduce hyperactivity within MTL improve memory performance .</detailed_description>
