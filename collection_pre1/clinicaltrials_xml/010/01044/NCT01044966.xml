	<brief_title>A Study Intraventricular Liposomal Encapsulated Ara-C ( DepoCyt ) Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant improvement diagnostic image neurosurgical technique , current treatment modality high-grade gliomas inadequate . As , median survival patient GBM order month , even cytoreductive surgery , radiation chemotherapy . Fewer 3 % GBM patient still alive 5 year diagnosis . A rise incidence report GBM , survival rate patient GBM show improvement last two decade . For reason explore novel therapy treatment GBM warrant . Neuro-oncology currently midst paradigm shift term accept understand pathophysiology gliomagenesis . Classic `` dedifferentiation '' hypothesis , model cellular origin glioma neoplastic transformation differentiate glia , currently challenge hypothesis suggest dysregulated glial progenitor cell responsible gliomagenesis . Growing evidence exist glial progenitor cell persist adult mammalian brain , line lateral ventricle subventricular zone ( SVZ ) dentate gyrus , play role gliomagenesis . Gliomas frequently occur close proximity ventricular system SVZ high-grade lesion like GBM `` spread '' midline structure cross corpus callosum contralateral hemisphere . Glial progenitor cell line lateral ventricle SVZ dentate gyrus may source `` tumor '' cell `` spread '' midline structure corpus callosum well continuously replenish tumor bed result local recurrence . The lack significant clinical advance treat GBM may due oversight SVZ component disease . It hypothesis successful treatment GBM require suppression SVZ component addition currently accept modality hemispheric tumor resection follow radiation chemotherapy . This understanding gliomagenesis yet use clinically treatment GBM . We hypothesize SVZ incubator future recurrences GBM propose target SVZ progenitor cell intraventricular liposomal encapsulate Ara-C ( DepoCyt ) combination systemic metronomic dose temozolomide . Ara-C previously demonstrate inhibit proliferation migration SVZ precursor cell adult animal . Two patient treat use novel regimen demonstrate significant response warrant study treatment Phase I/II clinical trial propose . This also basis successful application grant Orphan-Drug designation cytarabine ( Ara-C ) liposome injection ( trade name : DepoCyt ) treatment glioma ( Designation # 06-2348 ) January 30 , 2007 .</detailed_description>
