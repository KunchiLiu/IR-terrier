	<brief_summary>The purpose open-label , non-comparative , multi-center protocol evaluate safety provide treatment ICL670 patient risk life threaten complication due transfusional iron overload document inability tolerate commercially available iron chelators due severe toxicity render continued therapy either impossible hazardous . Patients also ineligible on-going registration trial ICL670 include study . In exceptional case , patient degree iron overload immediately life-threatening ineligible registration trial also enrol provided well-documented , sound justification alternative chelation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients risk lifethreatening complication due transfusional iron overload unable tolerate therapy commercially available iron chelators ( mainly deferoxamine and/or deferiprone ) document severe toxicity . Patients degree iron overload immediately lifethreatening ineligible trial ICL670 could also enrol provide welldocumented , sound justification alternative chelation therapy . Serum ferritin ≥ 8000 μg/L . Serum ferritin &lt; 8000μg/L LIC ≥ 7 mg Fe/g dry weight . Patients ≥ 8 blood transfusion per year require order maintain Hemoglobin level &gt; 9 g/dL . Female patient reach menarche sexually active use double barrier contraception ( oral plus barrier contraception ) , undergone total hysterectomy and/or ovariectomy , tubal ligation . Written , voluntary inform consent . Patients transfusional iron overload experience severe toxicity therapy iron chelators ( e.g . deferoxamine and/or deferiprone ) . Patients nontransfusional hemosiderosis . Patients severe liver failure define score ≥ 10 point ChildPugh scale . Patients serum creatinine 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) screening . Patients history nephrotic syndrome . Patients diagnosis clinically relevant cataract previous history clinically relevant ocular toxicity relate iron chelation therapy . Patients severe systemic disease unrelated iron overload would prevent undergoing treatment ICL670 . Patients psychiatric addictive disorder prevent give inform consent undergo treatment ICL670 . Pregnant breast feeding patient . Patients treat systemic investigational drug within past four week topical investigational drug within past seven day . Any surgical medical condition might significantly alter absorption excretion drug show evidence follow : History inflammatory bowel disease History major gastrointestinal tract surgery gastrectomy , gastroenterostomy , bowel resection History pancreatic injury pancreatitis ; indication impair pancreatic function/injury indicate abnormal lipase amylase Patients consider investigator potentially unreliable and/or cooperative regard protocol . History drug alcohol abuse within 12 month prior dose .</criteria>
