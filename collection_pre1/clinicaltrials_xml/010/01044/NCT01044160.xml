	<brief_summary>This proposal examine trauma growth response childhood cancer experience . It address number gap unanswered question literature , integrate several distinct relate line research . The rationale proposal outline briefly follow : 1 . Traumatic stress model focus pathology dominate pediatric psychosocial oncology research despite empiric evidence low level post-traumatic stress population . 2 . The assumption 'cancer traumatic event ' bias research design ( include lack control comparison ) focus deficit pathological outcome . 3 . This deficit-oriented approach stimulate development intervention treat prevent PTSD , may unnecessary even harmful . 4 . Theoretical empiric evidence suggest common response traumatic stress growth positive change , posttraumatic growth phenomenon understudied pediatric population . 5 . Cognitive personality factor important determinant PTSD positive growth outcome , construct positive psychology theory may particularly relevant child cancer . 6 . Empirically , parent child cancer appear high risk PTSD/PTSS , although result unequivocal , research bias apply parental outcomes . This proposal include assessment parental PTSS PTG , outcome predictor child outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine follow outcome : 1 . To examine outcome posttraumatic growth benefit finding ( PTG ) child cancer/cancer survivor comparison population child without history serious illness . 2 . To examine outcomes posttraumatic stress ( PTSS/PTSD ) child cancer/cancer survivor comparison child without history serious illness . 3 . To examine predictor child posttraumatic stress posttraumatic growth medical variable , life event history , family environment , child personality variable . 4 . To apply accelerated longitudinal design examine trajectory pathological outcome posttraumatic stress ( PTSS ) positive outcome challenge-related growth ( CRG ) child cancer/cancer survivor comparison population child without history serious illness . Additional observation obtain 1- , 3- , 5-years post study entry . 5 . To examine outcome PTG PTSS/PTSD parent child cancer/cancer survivor comparison parent healthy child . Parental PTSS/PTSD PTG examine outcomes predictor child outcome . 6 . To examine predictor parent PTSS/PTSD PTG demographic medical variable , life event history , parent personality variable . 7 . To determine sensitivity/specificity measure PTSS screen PTSD base diagnostic interview . 8 . To examine validity reliability new measure child personality , Five Factor Personality Inventory Children ( FFPIC ) . 9 . To examine emerge social developmental outcome longitudinal cohort . 10 . To develop electronic version study measure compare data obtain electronically ( desktop laptop computer ) , data obtain paper comparability reliability outcomes obtain .</detailed_description>
