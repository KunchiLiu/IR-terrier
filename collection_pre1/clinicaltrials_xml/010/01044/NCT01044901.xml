	<detailed_description>Cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) gain increase clinical application cardiopulmonary disease . Due 3-dimensional nature , CMR consider gold-standard quantifying leave right ventricular systolic function size . Additionally , high tissue contrast allow detailed characterization myocardial tissue . Specifically , use technique late gadolinium enhancement use detect presence tiny amount myocardial scar . Other technique show correlate strongly myocardial iron content . Just importantly , CMR perfusion image accurately quantify myocardial blood flow provide tremendous insight function microcirculation . CMR 's high spatial temporal resolution , 3-dimensional approach , ability characterize tissue , ability evaluate micro- macro-circulation make comprehensive technique evaluation heart disease . Recently , one CMR study already show presence cardiac microvascular disease subset adult sickle cell disease ( SCD ) patient absence infarcted myocardium , myocardial iron overload , coronary artery disease , increase evidence contribution leave heart disease pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) development patient ; unfortunately , strong conclusion could make study underpowered . Thus , proposal leverage advantage offer CMR well characterize detect PH cardiopulmonary subphenotypes SCD patient population .</detailed_description>
