	<brief_summary>This research study carry study new way possibly treat HIV . This agent call `` Zinc Finger Nuclease '' ZFN short . ZFNs proteins delete another protein name CCR5 . This CCR5 protein require certain type HIV ( CCR5 tropic ) enter infect T-cells . T cell one white blood cell use body fight HIV . The important call `` CD4 T-cells . '' Some People bear without CCR5 T-cells . These people remain healthy resistant infection HIV . Other people low number CCR5 T-cells , HIV disease less severe slow cause disease ( AIDS ) . Even detectable level HIV blood , HIV remain tissue body , primarily gut tissue . HIV infect CD4+ T-cells include blood gut . The new treatment study involve remove white blood cell blood contains CD4+ T-cells . The extracted CD4+ T-cells genetically modify ZFNs resistant infection HIV remove CCR5 gene surface CD4+ T cell HIV enters cell . Additional genetically modify cell manufacture re-infused back . Researchers hope genetically modify cell resistant infection HIV able reproduce additional resistant CD4+ T-cells body . Laboratory study show CD4+ T-cells modify ZFNs , HIV prevent kill CD4+ T-cells . On basis laboratory result , thre potential ZFNs may work human infected HIV improve immune system allow CD4+ T-cells survive longer . The purpose research study find whether `` zinc finger '' modify CD4+ T-cells safe give human find `` zinc finger '' modify T-cell affect HIV .</brief_summary>

CD4+ T cell count &gt; 500 cells/mm3 Heterozygous CCR5 delta32 mutation On stable antiretroviral medication ( change treatment within 4 week screen willing discontinue current antiretroviral therapy structure therapy interruption Cohort 4 On stable antiretroviral medication ( change treatment within 4 week screen willing continue current antiretroviral therapy week 8 infusion CD4+ T cell count &gt; 350 cells/mm3 . HIV1 &gt; 1,000 copies/mL screen respond current antiviral therapy ( i.e . HIVRNA plasma level &gt; 1000 copies/ml least 12 week stable , unchanged ARV therapy ) . Acute chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C infection Active recent ( prior 6 month ) AIDS define complication . Any cancer malignancy within past 5 year , exception successfully treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin low grade ( 0 1 ) anal cervical dysplasia . Current diagnosis NYHA grade 3 4 CHF , uncontrolled angina uncontrolled arrhythmias . History feature physical examination indicative bleeding diathesis . Previous treatment HIV experimental vaccine within 6 month prior screen , previous gene therapy use integrate vector . Use chronic corticosteroid , hydroxyurea , immunomodulating agent ( e.g. , interleukin2 , interferonalpha gamma , granulocyte colony stimulate factor , etc . ) within 30 day prior enrollment Breastfeeding , pregnant unwilling use acceptable method birth control 6 month follow last infusion SB728T cell . warfarin medication likely affect platelet function aspect blood coagulation 2 week period prior leukapheresis . Active drug alcohol use dependence Serious illness require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 day prior study entry . Recent vaccination intercurrent illness ( within 5 week prior infusion ) Have allergy hypersensitivity study product excipients ( human serum albumin , DMSO Dextran 40 ) . Subjects currently take maraviroc receive maraviroc within 6 month prior screen . Cohort 4 : HIV1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL screen respond current antiviral therapy CD4+ T cell count &gt; 350 cells/mm3</criteria>
