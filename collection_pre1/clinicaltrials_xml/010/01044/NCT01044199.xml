	<brief_title>Study Intradermal Administration PCEC Rabies Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 16,000-39,000 person come contact potentially rabid animal receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) year US . To appropriately manage potential human exposure rabies , risk infection must accurately assess . Administration rabies PEP medical urgency , medical emergency , decision must delay . Prophylaxis occasionally complicate adverse reaction , reaction rarely severe . Current data safety efficacy active passive rabies vaccination derive human animal study . Timely appropriate human pre-exposure prophylaxis ( Pre-EP ) PEP prevent human rabies . Currently US , approve dosage administration PEP previously unvaccinated person consist administration vaccine ( HDCV PCECV ) HRIG . Vaccine administer IM day 0 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 28 ( deltoid area ) . The approved dosage administration pre-exposure prophylaxis ( Pre-EP ) consist three 1.0-mL injection vaccine ( HDCV PCECV ) administer IM ( deltoid area ) , one injection per day day 0 , 7 , 21 28 ) . Intradermal ( ID ) route administration rabies vaccination use certain country PEP Pre-EP , approve WHO modern potent cell culture vaccine . Recent study outside USA find use PCEC rabies vaccine ID administration immunogenic safe . The primary goal study obtain additional safety immunogenicity data ID administration 0.1 mL dos inactivate PCEC rabies virus vaccine adult . Given need provide alternative route administration current approve intramuscular route order protect large number people face potential vaccine shortage . The data yield clinical trial provide evidence support alternative route administration dose PCECV US .</detailed_description>
