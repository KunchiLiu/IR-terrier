	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) 4th lead cause death United States , affect 24 million people responsible $ 32 billion annually direct indirect health care cost . Based upon national COPD prevalence data , estimate 483,000 Coloradans COPD ( 193,000 diagnose 290,000 undiagnosed ) , care patient cost $ 490 million annually . Therefore , alter impact COPD State People Colorado , propose introduce telephone-dependent , internet-supported , self-monitoring `` eHealth '' management system urban rural Colorado setting order decrease healthcare utilization , improve management COPD base upon current national guideline , improve quality life , reduce health care cost decrease COPD exacerbation . We base program successful clinical pilot study , perform University Colorado Hospital ( UCH ) 2004-2005 , demonstrate dramatic improvement quality life decrease health care cost . We propose enroll patient advance COPD , history COPD exacerbation , patient high healthcare cost , great disability , high mortality . The ultimate goal project demonstrate feasibility efficacy proactive management strategy disseminate throughout urban rural Colorado . In first phase target two Denver Metro sit , UCH Kaiser-Permanente ( KP ) , rural site ( determine ) . We choose urban site strong interest enact eHealth Program , organize system healthcare delivery number COPD patient serve . We particularly enthusiastic application technology rural , underserved area , approach potential dramatically improve delivery healthcare large portion Colorado chronically plague inadequate health care network lack specialty care .
