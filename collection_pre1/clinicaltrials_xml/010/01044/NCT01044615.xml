	<brief_summary>We utilize set imaging modality include compute tomography ( CT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , suite magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) tool , investigate change human brain result mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Imaging Tools Study Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recruit mTBI subject control subject . Each subject undergo set image modality , result analyze difference structural , physiological , molecular level . The long term goal research development method diagnose mTBI base physical marker . This phased project begin pilot study follow future study large sample size .</detailed_description>
