	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving capecitabine together lapatinib ditosylate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give capecitabine lapatinib ditosylate together work treat patient squamous cell cancer head neck .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Lapatinib Ditosylate Treating Patients With Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Overall survival ( OS ) primary endpoint . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Progression free survival ( PFS ) . II . Time disease progression sit progression . III . Response rate . IV . Toxicity combination population . V. Quality life . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-21 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
