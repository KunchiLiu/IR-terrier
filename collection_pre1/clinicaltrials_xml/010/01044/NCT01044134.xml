	<brief_summary>Advice increase water consumption part weight-reducing diet - typically 8 cup ( 64 fl oz , ~2 L ) per day ( `` 8x8 '' water recommendation ) - almost ubiquitously recommended healthcare professional . Many believe water promotes weight loss numerous physiological mechanism . However , limited observational data virtually experimental data exist regard effect water consumption body weight . In study , propose randomize controlled pilot study two group overweight adolescent receive standard weight loss regimen , either ( experimental intervention ) without ( control intervention ) additional advice support increase water consumption . We utilize individual session , innovative text message protocol , motivational telephone call promote adherence intervention . The purpose pilot study evaluate feasibility obtain preliminary efficacy data , inform design future , definitive study . It hypothesize increase water consumption improve efficacy standard weight-reducing diet lead decrease consumption energy-containing beverage , decrease total energy intake , improve diet quality , improve immune status , improve cardiovascular diabetes risk factor . This simple behavioral intervention feasible significantly increase water consumption among participant experimental vs. control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Think AHEAD ( A Healthy Eating And Drinking ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 6-month randomized control trial . After initial baseline screening assessment , 60 overweight adolescent randomly assign ( 30 subject per group ) standard weight-reducing diet advice consume 8 cup water per day ( experimental group ) standard weight-reducing diet without additional advice ( control group ) . The intervention consist nutrition education behavioral counseling register dietitian , individual session telephone call . Mobile text messaging use reinforce information present individual session thereby foster adherence dietary advice . Diet prescription differ regard specificity recommendation regard water consumption physical activity recommendation differ group . The frequency content text message consistent experimental control group , exception experimental group receive additional phrase message encourage `` 8 x8 '' water recommendation . A registered dietitian communicate participant one time per month , either individual session telephone . Individual session include nutrition class , taste testing , hands-on activity , opportunity question answer . Text message send daily basis . Study outcome assess baseline regular interval throughout 6 month study . ANALYSIS PLAN : The blind randomization break July 28 , 2014 data analyze accord follow plan . All analysis follow intention-to-treat principle , attribute subject assign diet regardless compliance . Baseline characteristic compare diet group use Fisher exact test categorical variable t-test continuous variable . The 6-month change baseline primary secondary outcome compare group use general linear model , adjust baseline covariates potentially correlate outcome . These include demographic , socioeconomic status , anthropometrics , physical activity , beverage consumption . We test covariates potential interaction , i.e. , differential effect outcome two trial arm . The null hypothesis 6-month change baseline differ diet group .</detailed_description>
