	<brief_summary>The objective application identify pharmacologic agent help couple female partner ovulate regularly successfully obtain goal deliver healthy child , whose use result low rate multiple gestation . The central hypothesis , infertile ovulatory woman undergo ovarian stimulation ( OS ) intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) , use aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) stimulate ovary sufficiently produce reduction rate pregnancy , significantly reduce number multiple gestational pregnancy result stimulation clomiphene citrate ( CC ) follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) . The rationale propose research reduction multiple pregnancy rate could significantly reduce maternal neonatal morbidity mortality , well cost healthcare individual society .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient Population The population consist 900 woman include woman ≥18 ≤40 year year age ( time randomization ) desirous conceive recruit approximately two year period Reproductive Medicine Network ( RMN ) clinical site possibly Specialized Cooperative Center Programs Reproductive Research ( SCCPIR ) sit , public notification program . Study Design This multi-center , prospective , partially blind clinical trial gonadotropin vs. clomiphene citrate vs. aromatase inhibitor . The randomization scheme coordinate data coordination center ( DCC ) randomization stratify participate site within site age 18-34 35-40 . Treatment Patients randomize receive either FSH , CC , AI accord randomization table generate computer randomization program . Treatment assignment block site age group . Subjects randomized pill treatment receive medication double blinded fashion , receive one type pill ( overcoated CC AI ) . Subjects randomize injectable medication ( FSH ) receive vial medication . Primary efficacy parameter Multiple gestation rate follow recruitment multiple follicular development AI , compare CC FSH . Secondary efficacy parameter Rate pregnancy obtain , live birth rate , time pregnancy follow administration aromatase inhibitor , compare CC FSH well live birth rate multiple gestation pregnancy .</detailed_description>
