	<brief_summary>Background : Long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) component management chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) improve survival patient severe daytime hypoxemia ( define arterial oxygen pressure [ paO2 ] measure stable state &lt; =55 mmHg range 56-59 mmHg clinical evidence pulmonary hypertension polycythemia note ) . In Canada , LTOT usually provide stationary oxygen concentrator recommend use least 15-18 hour day . Several study demonstrate deterioration arterial blood gas pressure oxygen saturation sleep patient COPD . Sleep-related oxygen desaturation often occur patient qualify LTOT . The suggestion make natural progression COPD end stag chronic pulmonary hypertension , severe hypoxemia , right heart failure , death dependent upon severity desaturation occur sleep . This attractive hypothesis support fact hypoxemic episode sleep accompany substantial increase pulmonary arterial pressure often important cardiac arrhythmia . Supplemental nocturnal oxygen alleviates acute increase pulmonary arterial pressure cardiac arrhythmia . It suggest , long run , nocturnal oxygen therapy ( N-O2 ) may halt progression long-standing cor pulmonale prolong survival . Probably due fact recommendation scientific society regard indication use N-O2 COPD qualify conventional LTOT presently imprecise , number patient currently treat N-O2 although beneficial effect therapy confirm . Objectives : Primary objective : To determine , patient COPD qualify LTOT present significant nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation , whether N-O2 provide period 3 year decrease mortality delay prescription LTOT . Secondary objective : To estimate , population , cost-utility ratio nocturnal oxygen therapy 3-year period . Hypotheses : In patient COPD qualify LTOT present significant nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation , N-O2 provide period 3 year effective decrease mortality delay requirement LTOT ; cost-effective favorably compare medical intervention . Research plan : Study design : We propose 3-year , multi-center , placebo-controlled , randomized trial nocturnal oxygen therapy add usual care patient present sleep-related oxygen desaturation qualify LTOT . Inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) patient diagnosis COPD support history past smoke obstructive disease FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % ; ( 2 ) saturation rest &lt; 95 % ; ( 3 ) patient fulfil definition nocturnal oxygen desaturation : &gt; =30 % record time transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % least one two consecutive recording . Intervention : nocturnal oxygen therapy : N-O2 delivered overnight allow oxygen saturation &gt; 90 % . Placebo : The patient allocate control group receive room air deliver defective concentrator . The comparison double blind . Primary outcome : The primary outcome trial mortality cause requirement LTOT ( composite outcome ) . Secondary outcome : Secondary outcome include quality life utility measure , cost societal perspective compliance oxygen therapy . Trial duration : The follow-up period last least 3 year . We expect trial complete within 5 year . Sample size calculation : The sample size give 90 % chance show 30 % relative reduction event rate two study group ( i.e. , event rate intervention placebo group 28 % 40 % respectively ) . We calculate 300 patient per group need complete study ( 630 account potential withdrawal ) .</brief_summary>
