	<brief_title>Reducing Donor Specific Antibody ( DSA ) Strength Maintenance Kidney Transplant Recipients ( DSA Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development DSA post-transplant associate chronic rejection graft failure . EC-MPS thought key drug prevent cellular antibody mediate rejection . Several study show recipient receive optimal dose EC-MPS fewer antibody mediate rejection may require low dose calcineurin inhibitor and/or corticosteroid thus reduce side effect extend graft survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recipients cadaveric , live related living unrelated kidney transplant positive DSA titer . Males female , 1875 year age . Patients currently receive MPA ( 500mg 2500 mg CellCept daily 360 mg 1800 mg myfortic daily ) , cyclosporine tacrolimus without corticosteroid part immunosuppressive regimen least 6 month . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment . The test perform baseline visit . Effective contraception must use trial , 4 week follow discontinuation study medication . Patients willing able participate full course study write informed consent obtain . Exclusion criterion : Multisolid cellular organ transplant ( e.g . combine pancreas , liver , islet , bone marrow ) , either concurrent previous ( exception second kidney transplant allow ) . Evidence graft rejection treatment acute rejection within 14 day prior Baseline visit . Patients receive investigational drug within 4 week prior study entry . Patients thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 75,000/mm3 ) , absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/mm3 and/or leukocytopenia ( &lt; 4,000/mm3 ) , and/or hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL prior enrollment . The presence severe GI disorder ( Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Inflammatory Bowel Disease know Peptic Ulcer Disease ) . Presence clinically significant infection require continued therapy , chronic infection ( e.g . HIV , Hep B Hep C ) , malignancy ( within last 5 year , except excise squamous basal cell carcinoma skin ) , lymphoma renal toxicity would interfere appropriate conduct study . Evidence severe liver disease ( incl . abnormal liver profile i.e . AST , ALT total bilirubin â‰¥ 3 time ULN ) severe diarrhea active peptic ulcer disease would interfere appropriate conduct study . Abnormal physical laboratory finding clinical significance within 2 week inclusion would interfere objective study . Patients symptoms significant somatic mental illness evidence drug and/or alcohol abuse . Patients receive &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone dose . History hypersensitivity study drug drug similar chemical structure MPA . Patients make DSA antibody . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( local ) ; female childbearing potential unwilling use effective mean contraception plan become pregnant . Any medical condition , opinion site investigator base recall chart review would interfere complete study , include limited visual problem cognitive impairment .</criteria>
