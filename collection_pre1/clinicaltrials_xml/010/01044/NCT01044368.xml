	<brief_summary>This project test effectiveness Internet base glucose monitor system A1C level patient type 2 diabetes . All patient give meter test strip test blood glucose level , however , half require also upload meter onto Internet view endocrinologist . The doctor send message back patient comment reading . The effect ongoing communication measure change glucose level ( HbA1C ) 3 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To determine whether use Internet-based glucose monitoring system ( ALR Technologies Inc. ) improve Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level patient type 2 diabetes mellitus treat 1 oral anti-diabetic medication . Hypothesis : The investigator propose standardized encounter use Internet improve outcome treatment patient type 2 DM . Justification : An important aspect diabetes care self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) level order ass effectiveness treatment modify treatment achieve desirable glucose level . All patient type 2 DM recommend perform SMBG . However , often require intervention health professional order prevent immediate serious complication hyper hypoglycemia . The frequent SMBG effective intervention health professional may eventually allow tight control blood glucose level delay prevent complication associate diabetes . Objectives : The investigator propose measure HbA1c level begin study compare HbA1c level three six month initiate Internet-based blood glucose monitoring system ( IBMS ) . Research Method : Fifty patient randomize equally ( 50/50 chance ) either conventional therapy use Internet blood glucose monitoring system . Conventional therapy ( Control group ) consist general care comprise SMBG 3 time per day visit endocrinologist 3-month interval HbA1c , cholesterol , serum creatinine determination 3-month interval 6 month . Those patient randomize Internet system ( Intervention group ) require perform SMBG 3 time per day upload meter glucose value online every 2 week review doctor . As well , visit endocrinologist every 3 month HbA1c , cholesterol , serum creatinine measurement 3-month interval 6 month . Statistical Analysis : The primary endpoint HbA1c level change A1c level . The secondary endpoint include severe hypoglycemia define require external aid , hospital admission CVD relate intervention , adverse event unplanned hospitalization cause last 24 hour . For group , A1C level start study compare A1C level 3 6 month start study . Paired t-tests random effect model ( longitudinal analysis ) examine difference A1C value study duration . Unpaired , independent t-tests do examine difference A1C value two group intervention . Planned sample size 50 .</detailed_description>
