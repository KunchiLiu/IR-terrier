	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct multicenter , open-label , randomize , phase II study patient newly diagnose glioblastoma ( CeCil ) . Patients meet eligibility criterion CENTRIC phase III trial exception MGMT-promoter methylation could demonstrate . The treatment backbone study arm consist postoperative radiation therapy concomitant daily temozolomide , follow 6 cycle temozolomide accord 21 28 day regimen ( experimental arm RTOG 0525 / EORTC 26052-22053 phase III study ) . In study arm ( A ) Cilengitide ( dose 2000 mg iv administration , 2x/week ) add backbone second study arm ( B ) , Cetuximab add ( initial dose 400 mg/m² administer intravenous infusion 2 hour follow weekly dose 250 mg/m² iv 1 hour ) . In study arm , treatment administer 52 consecutive treatment week . The 1-year overall survival ( 1y-OS ) follow randomization serve primary endpoint study arm .</brief_summary>
