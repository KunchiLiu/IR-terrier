	<brief_title>Evaluate Efficacy Armodafinil Patients With B-cell Lymphoma Severe Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims analyze separately stratify treatment arm ( chemotherapy treatment arm vs. post-treatment remission arm ) . Primary Objective : - To determine whether armodafinil effective placebo reduce fatigue measure change score FACT-Fatigue report study entry , week 7 study treatment , study completion ( week 13 ) . Secondary Objectives : - To determine whether armodafinil effective placebo reduce fatigue measure standard actigraphy summary statistic include total sleep time ( TST ) , wake sleep onset ( WASO ) , sleep latency , number awakening , daytime sleep time , mean daytime activity , peak activity , acrophase , circadian mesor week 1 screening , week 7 study treatment , study completion ( week 13 ) . - To determine whether armodafinil effective placebo improve work quality measure change score WLQ© report study entry ( week 1 ) study completion ( week 13 ) . - To determine whether armodafinil effective placebo reduce fatigue measure change activity pattern actigraphy use applied functional data analysis week 1 screening , week 7 study treatment , study completion ( week 13 ) . - To evaluate whether measure cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-α , TGF-α ) elevate baseline . - To evaluate whether measure cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-α , TGF-α ) change time study entry study completion . - To assess whether cytokine level ( IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-α , TGF-α ) correlate circadian pattern wrist actigraphy self-described report fatigue measure FACT-Fatigue baseline study completion .</detailed_description>
