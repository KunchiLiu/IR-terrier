	<brief_summary>The 2009 flu pandemic global outbreak new strain influenza A virus subtype H1N1 , commonly know swine flu , first identify April 2009 . Large-scale immunization essential approach control pandemic.Vaccines become available protection pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) 2009 infection countries.In response pandemic , novel vaccine virus strain A/California/07/2009 ( H1N1 ) develop recently approve vaccination among specific population China . However , safety effectiveness vaccine prime concern authority public.This report detail finding observational clinical trial safety immunogenicity influenza A ( H1N1 ) 2009 monovalent vaccine . The virus Swine Flu H1N1 outbroke 2009 sensitive neuraminidase inhibitor ( Oseltamivir , zanamivir peramivir ) drug resistant adamantanamine derivative ( amantadine Flumadine ) , therefore neuraminidase inhibitor recommend antiviral therapy Swine Flu H1N1 , effect evidence data drug modify symptom decrease death rate H1N1 America Mexico . However , clinically , investigator encounter virus infect resistant strain Oseltamivir , urge effective treatment plan . In view situation , seek effective measure H1N1 flu top priority benefit human life economy globally . This Topic take classic strategy passive immunity perform basic clinical research apply blood fix treat critical H1N1 patient collect blood healthy person inoculate specific H1N1 vaccine cure critical H1N1 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Basic Clinical Research Applying Blood Fix Treat Critical H1N1 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus identify significant cause febrile respiratory illness Mexico United States . It rapidly spread many country around world , prompt World Health Organization ( WHO ) declare pandemic June 11 , 2009 . Antiviral drug , oseltamivir zanamivir , may effective treating case swine flu , large-scale immunization essential approach control pandemic.Although preliminary evidence match case-control study suggest protection 2008-9 trivalent inactivate vaccine pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 , particularly severe form disease . A vaccine H1N1 expect effective tool control influenza A ( H1N1 ) infection.In response pandemic , novel vaccine virus strain A/California/07/2009 ( H1N1 ) develop recently approve vaccination among specific population China.The primary safety objective study assess safety split- virion inactivate H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant administer 15 ug dose.The primary immunogenicity objective ass hemagglutinin antibody neutralize antibody response follow split- virion inactivate A ( H1N1 ) vaccine without adjuvant . Participants 148 healthy person age 18-60 year history novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination . This observational , Phase II study healthy male non-pregnant female , age 18-60 years.This study design investigate safety immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 virus vaccine approve Chinese Food Drug Administration.Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 21 day . Immunogenicity test hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) assay microneutralization ( MN ) assay serum obtain day 0,7 21 vaccination.In addition , take clinical research apply blood fix treat critical H1N1 patient collect blood healthy person inoculate H1N1 vaccine cure critical H1N1 patient observe effectiveness safety , purpose work new weapon H1N1 . According Blood Donation Law People 's Republic China , blood donation shall follow principle voluntary.The donor healthy person inoculate specific H1N1 vaccine titer H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition antibody must 1：320 examination ( kit shall provide WHO ) Shanghai Municipal Center Disease Control Prevention .</detailed_description>
