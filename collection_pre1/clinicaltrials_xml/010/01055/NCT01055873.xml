	<brief_summary>ANRS-EP38-IMMIP non interventional study . A single blood sample ( 30 mL ) drawn hospital visit clinical follow-up . Immunological assay perform fresh blood . Cells plasma store kept frozen additional biological evaluation . Patients include French perinatal cohort ( ANRS CO-10 ) , follow since 1996 clinical site patient belong ANRS CO-10 . In ANRS CO-10 cohort , patient prospectively follow birth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : Efficient anti-retroviral treatment lead significantly increase life expectancy . Children perinatal infection reach adulthood . The deleterious impact viral replication ontogenesis immune system , high thymic activity early year life , preclude extrapolation data pertain adult immune status mean specific pediatric study require . No data available concern immune status adolescent young adult infected via materno-foetal transmission . Detailed description : Our assumption duration uncontrolled viral replication affect immune status treatment viral replication associate : 1. disease progression independently CD4+ T cell level ; 2. accelerate senescence immune system ; 3. destruction organ involve restoration major immune cell population . The aim study : 1. describe immune virological status perinatally infect patient 15 yr old 2. study association : 1. current virological/clinical therapeutic status , 2. duration uncontrolled viremia ( defined treatment history ) , 3. virological , immunological ( CD4+ number ) , clinical status time HAART initiation . The immune status define ( 1 ) number phenotype CD4+ CD8+ T lymphocytes , dendritic cell , regulatory T cell , NK cell , ( 2 ) function ( proliferation cytokine production ) CD4+ CD8+ lymphocytes specific HIV , recall antigen ( tetanus toxoid ) virus ( CMV , EBV Flu ) , repertoire Natural Killer cell receptor . The virological status define level HIV DNA PBMCs , HIV subtype , resistance mutation archive circulate virus sequence region viral envelope involve co-receptor use . Clinical , therapeutic , demographic , virological immunological data collect birth member ANRS CO-10 cohort , collect retrospectively since diagnosis non-included patient .</detailed_description>
