	<brief_summary>This pilot study protocol induce falciparum malaria infection healthy volunteer order test activity novel agent develop drug treatment uncomplicated malaria . In pilot study , 16 healthy male volunteer administer low level malaria infection via infected human red blood cell . After 6 day administer one two register antimalarial treatment ( 8 volunteer treatment ) order define rate clearance infection . This information use design similar future study initial assessment efficacy novel antimalarial drug development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Test Activity Antimalarial Drugs Against Induced Malaria Infection Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , control , randomize , study use BSP inoculum challenge model ass activity antimalarial agent . The study conduct 2 cohort ( n = 6 n = 10 ) . Cohort 2 commence least day 12 cohort 1 review Safety Review Team follow day 9 exit cohort 1 . The participant randomize 1:1 two registered antimalarial . This enable study use register antimalarial drug reference treatment ( one slow act one fast act ) , aim inform trial design , endpoint test regimen assess new candidate antimalarial drug development . The study follow sequence challenge inoculation , reference treatment follow-up . Healthy male participant inoculate Day 1 ~1,800 Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocyte administer intravenously . On outpatient basis , participant monitor morning ( AM ) night ( PM ) day 3 day 5 adverse event unexpected early onset symptom , sign parasitological evidence malaria . On day 5 evening , participant admit study unit confine safety monitor antimalarial treatment . Reference treatment administration begin even Day 6 continue Day 7 8 ( 3 day treatment ) . If clinical parasitologic evidence malaria ( either identification two malaria parasite malaria thick film , platelet count le 100 x109/L , onset clinical feature malaria ) occur day 6 evening , allocate treatment begin time . Following treatment , participant follow inpatient least 86 hour , ( 4 evening ) ensure tolerance therapy clinical response , clinically well outpatient basis safety continue presence malaria parasites via PCR thick blood film review . Adverse event monitor via telephone monitoring , within clinical research unit outpatient review malaria challenge inoculation antimalarial study drug administration . Blood sample safety evaluation , malaria monitoring , red blood cell antibody draw baseline nominate time malaria challenge .</detailed_description>
