	<brief_summary>This investigation interested effect high dose vitamin C endothelial function healthy human . A high fat meal utilized induce endothelial dysfunction . It hypothesize , via antioxidant action , vitamin C reverse effect turn improve blood flow- involvement nitric oxide suggests could extend cerebral blood flow . This monitor trans cranial doppler flow meter near infrared spectroscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Cerebral Blood Flow Effects Vitamin C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute effect administer vitamin receive little research attention . The exception number study observe single dos variety vitamin , include Vitamin C , E several B vitamin , ameliorate endothelial dysfunction periphery participant smoke , suffer disorder diabetes mellitus cardio-vascular disease . Endothelial function also vary healthy people consequence diet , possible antioxidant vitamin attenuate vaso-constriction associate commonly consume foodstuff . Indeed , study Title et al ( 2000 ) show vitamin C improve endothelial function forearm follow glucose drink . Given putative underlying mechanism involve ( e.g . nitric oxide synthesis ) improvement may well also extend cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , therefore improvement aspect cognitive function . The study therefore assess effect single dose 1000 mg vitamin C cognitive performance cerebral arterial blood flow velocity ( cBFV ) use Trans-cranial Doppler , follow high fat meal use previous endothelial function research . The high fat meal administer 2 hour test begin . Research show meal type produce effect endothelium similar induce dysfunction diabetes i.e . blood flow restriction . No adverse effect report regard methodology however . In order monitor effect vitamin C ( case placebo ) endothelial function cerebral blood flow near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) trans cranial Doppler ( TCD ) record take throughout ( case former technique ) intermittent stage ( case latter ) . Both neuroimaging modality , use correctly ) entirely safe . Blood pressure reading also take intermittently throughout test session .</detailed_description>
