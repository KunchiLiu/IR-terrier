	<detailed_description>The main purpose study test safety three study drug , bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) , Everolimus ( Afinitor™ ) LBH589 ( Panobinostat ) give together . It hop study drug combination might lead great decrease size cancer and/or slow fast cancer grow compare drug give alone . There two part study . The purpose part I find high safest level drug give together . If enrolled part I study , start study drug time . The amount ( dose ) drug get depend enter study . The purpose part II see effect , good and/or bad , study drug give alone together . In addition , also give u good understand study drug work cancer . If enrol part II study , enter one three study drug arm : Study Drug Arm A : You receive everolimus alone two week , add bevacizumab LBH589 study regimen . Study Drug Arm B : You receive LBH589 alone two week , add bevacizumab LBH589 study regimen . Study Drug Arm C : You receive everolimus LBH589 together two week , add bevacizumab study regimen . ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS : - Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) intravenous ( I.V. , mean vein ) medication make special type human mouse protein call antibody . Bevacizumab block factor call VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) important angiogenesis ( growth new blood vessel ) . Blocking factor think block growth tumor-related blood vessel may stop growth cancer . Bevacizumab drug block VEGF activity currently evaluate clinical research study variety cancer . - Everolimus ( Afintor™ ) pill work block activity substance body know mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) . mTOR important help growth survival normal cancer cell . Blocking mTOR activity show slow kill cancer cell laboratory study . Everolimus drug block mTOR activity currently evaluate clinical research study variety cancer . - LBH589 ( Panobinostat ) new pill work block special group protein call histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) . HDACs important help growth survival normal cancer cell help growth new tumor-related blood vessel . Blocking HDAC activity show show slow kill cancer cell laboratory study . LBH589 drug block HDACs activity currently evaluate clinical research study variety cancer . LBH589 ( Panobinostat ) approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment cancer therefore consider investigational drug .</detailed_description>
