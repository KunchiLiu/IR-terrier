	<detailed_description>Summary Synthesis : Epidemiological study establish occurrence high rate AD person PTSD . Likewise , study alcohol/drug abuse treatment seeker document high rate trauma exposure PTSD . The high prevalence PTSD/AD comorbidity cause enormous human suffering , either go untreated resistant treatment effort . Both theory research concern interface two disorder suggest PTSD associate initiation excessive alcohol use and/or development AD way escape/avoidance behavioral mechanism wherein escalate alcohol use reinforce ability dampen negative emotion arousal associate PTSD . If PTSD often primary cause initiation maintenance AD , clinical intervention primarily impact PTSD lead significant improvement crave , use , alcohol . The finding two recent treatment study offer especially compelling support expectation . Drawing basic neuroscience research develop body suggestive clinical/applied research , lead consider putative memory modulate property adrenergic antagonist propranolol might therapeutic benefit PTSD/AD comorbid individual . Thus , propose study test hypothesis strategic administration propranolol couple elicitation/retrieval trauma-related memory dampen emotional distress , alcohol crave cue reactivity subsequent exposure trauma- alcohol-related cue . A two-week follow-up laboratory session clinical assessment permit u evaluate whether treatment benefit maintain time change alcohol use PTSD symptomatology .</detailed_description>
