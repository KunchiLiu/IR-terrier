	<brief_summary>In 2007 case control study complete within EUROCAT European network congenital anomaly register test hypothesis first trimester lamotrigine monotherapy exposure associate increase risk isolated oral cleft . This study find statistically significant increase risk oral cleft compare defect follow lamotrigine exposure uterus . The EUROCAT Antiepileptic Drug ( AED ) Database , establish original case control study 2007 , expand include additional five six year worth data . These data provide great power investigate risk isolate oral cleft , specific cleft type potential association additional specific malformation type ( e.g . neural tube defect ) . Data case isolate oral cleft register 1993 2012 extract EUROCAT member register meeting set inclusion criterion ( ensure completeness outcome exposure data ) . The primary comparison group include non oral cleft , non chromosomal malformation register collect data non malformed infant . This study also power include second control group chromosomal malformation , unlikely associate medication exposure . Data exposure anti-epileptic drug ( AEDs ) first trim pregnancy extract along key covariates include age mother , history epilepsy gestational age infant . Primary analysis , use logistic regression , compare lamotrigine monotherapy versus AED use across case control group secondary analysis compare lamotrigine monotherapy versus AED monotherapy ( without valproate ) . Data also monitor pattern lamotrigine exposure across additional specific malformation group interest .</brief_summary>
