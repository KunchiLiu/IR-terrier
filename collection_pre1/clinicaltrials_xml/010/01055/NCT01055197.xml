	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . This may effective treatment extensive stage small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial compare well radiation therapy brain work give without radiation therapy area body treat patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare 1-year overall median survival rate patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat prophylactic cranial irradiation v without consolidative extracranial radiotherapy follow platinum-based chemotherapy . Secondary - To compare treatment-related adverse event patient . - To evaluate pattern failure patient . - To compare time first failure patient . - To evaluate percentage plan radiotherapy dose give site . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response prior treatment ( complete response v partial response ) number metastatic lesion ( 1 vs 2-3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation 5 day per week 2 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation arm I . Patients also undergo consolidative extracranial radiotherapy locoregional residual metastatic disease 5 day per week 2-3 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week ; 1 , 2 , 6 , 9 , 12 month ; every 6 month 2 year ; annually thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically cytologically confirm extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) diagnose within past 6 months* Has 14 extracranial metastatic lesion NOTE : *Diagnosis make treatment chemotherapy Has complete 46 course platinumbased chemotherapy within past 8 week AND meet follow criterion : Radiographic partial complete response chemotherapy ≥ 1 site disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ( radiotherapy deliver primary disease chemotherapy , must complete partial response ≥ 1 site treat radiotherapy ) No progression site No limited stage SCLC , even disease progress No brain central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Zubrod performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/mm^3 Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL ( use transfusion intervention allow ) Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( patient receive radiotherapy liver ) Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN ( patient receive radiotherapy liver ) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN ( patient receive radiotherapy kidney ) Not pregnant nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective contraception No severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Acute bacterial fungal infection require IV antibiotic time study registration Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time study registration PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics Recovered prior chemotherapy ( i.e. , toxicity ≤ grade 1 [ except neuropathy alopecia ] ) Thoracic radiotherapy administer concurrently chemotherapy current diagnosis allow ( patient receive mediastinal radiotherapy per protocol ) No prior radiotherapy region cancer would result overlap radiotherapy field No concurrent chemotherapy</criteria>
