	<brief_summary>This Phase II clinical study open-label , multicenter study L19IL2 combination Dacarbazine patient metastatic melanoma . The study divide two part : phase IIa part , design establish recommend dose ( RD ) L19IL2 administer combination fix dose Dacarbazine , well determine preliminary tolerability profile ; second phase IIb part evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) include randomize study fix dose Dacarbazine without L19IL2 , dose RD determine phase IIa .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Phase II L19IL2 Combination With Dacarbazine Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose limit toxicity assess dose-escalation part Phase IIa day 1 day 21 first cycle . Response measure use RECIST criterion every 6 week ( every 2 cycle treatment ) . Patients stable respond disease assessment may receive additional treatment maximum 6 cycle induction . Patients stable respond disease induction may receive L19IL2 ( without dacarbazine ) every 2 week maintenance therapy . Tumor expression ED-B FN tumor uptake L19IL2 Dacarbazine assess via immunohistochemistry and/or method deem appropriate tumor tissue biopsy . Tumor biopsy perform superficial accessible cutaneous and/or subcutaneous lesion . Tumor biopsy consider optional preclude patient entry study patient refuse . Pharmacokinetics L19IL2 , Dacarbazine AIC assess serial blood sample use standard method . Overall response rate , PFS , survival rate 6 12 month , overall survival time patient separately patient Phase IIb part assess use standard method .</detailed_description>
