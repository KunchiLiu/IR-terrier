	<brief_summary>BKT-140 drug substance highly selective chemokine receptor ( CXCR4 ) antagonist , develop Biokine novel therapy Multiple Myeloma ( MM , type blood cancer ) . The unique combination activity BKT140 , i.e. , induction exit blood cell stem cell mature cell bone marrow peripheral blood , couple specific induction MM cell death BKT-140 , represent novel therapeutic strategy MM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Chemokine Receptor ( CXCR4 ) Antagonist Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The chemokine CXCL12 ( also call SDF-1 - stromal-derived-factor-1 ) receptor , CXCR4 ( ( CXC Chemokine Receptor 4 ) , molecule endow potent chemotactic activity hematopoietic cell , together play pivotal role traffic hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow 10,11 . The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis also critically involved retention hematopoietic cell within BM microenvironment . Following chemotherapy irradiation , CXCL12/CXCR4 axis delay recovery BM progenitor cell exit mature cell neutrophils monocyte periphery . Consequently , disruption CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction result mobilization hematopoietic cell include stem cell faster recovery treat BM . BKT140 ( 4F-benzoyl-TN14003 ) highly selective unique CXCR4 antagonist . Pre-clinical study show BKT140 bind CXCR4 high affinity ( 1nM ) 13 . Biokine demonstrate ability CXCR4 antagonist , BKT140 , mobilize various WBC neutrophil monocytes well progenitor stem cell , BM . The ability BKT140 stimulate mobilization cell superior AMD3100 , CXCR4 antagonist clinical development mobilization stem cell MM lymphoma patient , qualitatively quantitatively . BKT140 synergizes much efficiently G-CSF compare AMD3100 . Moreover , Biokine show BKT140 , synergism G-CSF ( NEUPOGEN® ) , much efficient increase number neutrophils activate monocyte blood , several fold compare G-CSF alone . BKT140 also shorten neutropenic period due early release neutrophil monocytes BM . More importantly , BKT140 , synergism G-CSF , reduce anemic period cause chemotherapy , due RBC production , occur G-CSF give sole treatment . More importantly , BKT140 , G-CSF AMD3100 , also capable shorten period cytopenia boost recovery hematopoietic cell BM exit periphery , therefore shorten period cytopenia follow chemotherapy irradiation BM transplantation . Importantly , Biokine show upon interaction CXCR4 , BKT140 , AMD3100 , selectively , specifically rapidly stimulate human leukemia myeloma cell death vitro vivo . Furthermore , BKT140 synergizes chemotherapeutic agent rapamycine induce MM cell death .</detailed_description>
