	<brief_title>An Adhesion Reduction Plan Management Surgical Open Abdomen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adhesions common consequence abdominal surgery . Trauma emergency general surgery patient may require open abdomen undergo series abdominal operation , may increasingly complicate presence adhesion . Adhesions appear soon initial operation gradually mature within day . The effect adhesion development subsequent surgery may include : increased procedure time ; difficulty differentiating , expose , access tissue plane ; increase risk inadvertent enterotomy . Complications adhesion include enteric obstruction enterocutaneous fistula . This study determine whether adhesion reduction plan , consist early adhesion prevention application bioresorbable membrane effective reduce extent severity adhesion incidence complication manage open abdomen trauma emergency general surgery .</detailed_description>
