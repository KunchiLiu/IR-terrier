	<brief_summary>Hypothesis Specific Aims : The investigator hypothesize ultrasound ( US ) visualization effective nerve stimulation ( NS ) identification peripheral nervous structure may associate less trauma patient discomfort . Specifically , investigator believe equivalent rate surgical anesthesia achievable non-invasive ultrasonic needle guidance comparison needle guidance intensity motor fiber response intermittent electrical nerve stimulation . Specifically , number needle stick identify brachial plexus total time plexus sheath injection may reduce achieve similar efficacy rate . The investigator hypothesize similar composite safety efficacy endpoint improve patient satisfaction acceptance favor US NS guidance nerve block indicate surgery extremity surgery . However , investigator believe economic assessment base upon capital hardware investment , operate room utilization , total block time , pay performance patient satisfaction metric require examination prior assimilation new technology clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized study 450 consecutive patient present upper extremity surgery schedule receive NB without general anesthesia surgical procedure . Patients randomize receive one two nerve localization technique 1:1 randomization ratio . Primary intraoperative provider supplemental sedative , additional local anesthetic infiltration analgesia , general anesthesia assessor VAS PCI blind technique . Patients 18 year age present elective upper extremity surgery plan supine position isolate interscalene axillary nerve block screen . Up 450 patient undergoing unilateral upper extremity procedure Lehigh Valley Hospital enrol . STUDY PROCEDURES Screening : All patient meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion eligible enrol . All subject preadmission test recruit prior surgical procedure initial contact make day schedule surgery . For patient preadmission test schedule find eligible study day surgery , patient consent study morning procedure study anesthesiologist . Only patient able understand English able legally give write informed consent recruit study . Following sign informed consent ( IRB approve ) permission surgeon anesthesiologist prior start anesthesia , vital sign , standard lab test , patient history physical examination review . Day Procedure : For NS group , interscalene/axillary block perform standard method use nerve stimulator attach four centimeter Stimuplex ( B Braun ) needle . Following application routine monitor , supplemental oxygen via facemask , intravenous sedation , skin overlie brachial plexus anesthetize . The Stimuplex needle insert guided position close proximity brachial plexus use endpoint muscle twitch involve hand stimulus intensity le 0.5 milliamps satisfaction operator . Forty ( 40 ) milliliter 0.5 percent Bupivicaine 1.5 % Mepivicaine 1:200,00 epinephrine inject incrementally intermittent aspiration . This block chosen study widespread use variety shoulder procedure low incidence complication . The quoted success rate literature interscalene block range 70 95 percent . For US group interscalene block perform method use ultrasound guide needle insertion . Following application routine monitor , supplemental oxygen via facemask , intravenous sedation , skin overlie brachial plexus anesthetize . A sterile cover use ultrasound probe . Using probe , anesthesiologist visualize nerve maneuver tip needle nerve guide ultrasound probe . Forty ( 40 ) milliliter 0.5 % Bupivicaine 1.5 % Mepivicaine 1:200,00 Epinephrine inject incrementally intermittent aspiration . This block chosen study widespread use variety shoulder procedure low incidence complication . The quoted success rate literature interscalene block range 70 95 percent . The brachial plexus visualize level root plexus level . Presence absence local anesthetic around nerve record use Sonosite Titan T-shaped ultrasound probe place patient 's skin . Still image brachial plexus local anesthetic capture patient . Patient identifier image , however image place patient 's medical record . Assessment block success : The success block assess examine motor strength anesthetize extremity degree anesthesia 30 minute injection . Strength distribution musculocutaneous , median , radial , ulnar nerve assess . Pinprick cold sensation assess distribution . A successful block one lack sensation cold pinprick distribution well strength less three five standard scale strength test distribution . Ultimately , block success ( yes/no ) determine pain free surgery require general anesthesia . The patient comfort index post op assessment carry . Completion Study : The study complete PACU discharge patient return his/her assessment PCI pain nausea data .</detailed_description>
