	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Our primary objective determine adjunctive varenicline efficacious ( vs. placebo ) initiate abstinence smoking cigarette subject stable bipolar disorder motivate quit smoke 12-week treatment phase . A secondary outcome determine whether initiated abstinence 12-week treatment phase maintain abstinence subsequent three-month follow-up period study medication . Additional outcome : plan test effectiveness varenicline reduce nicotine withdrawal symptom urge smoke , well safety use stable bipolar patient use adjunctive treatment smoke cessation . RESEARCH PLAN : We plan test hypothesis conduct randomized , placebo-controlled , treatment trial Chantix . Measures CO level expire air ( 10 ppm low ) , self-reported abstinence , psychopathology rating use evaluate primary secondary outcome along safety assessment . Smoking abstinence define 7-day point prevalence self-reported smoking verify objectively expire CO level 10 ppm less , assessed 12-weeks ( end treatment phase ) primary outcome . The criterion use assess maintenance abstinence non-treatment phase , i.e . 24 week end study . METHODS : Seventy-six subject DSM-IV bipolar disorder recruit Western Psychiatric Institute Clinic Dubois Regional Medical Center . Using 1:1 Randomization , also take account gender , subject sign informed consent document randomize receive Chantix placebo . It expect 16 76 may meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , leave 60 consent adult age 18-65 year DSM-IV bipolar disorder , confirm MINI ( Sheehan et al . ) Subjects must meet smoke inclusion criterion smoke 10 cigarette per day . Motivation quit smoking ( score least 7 Contemplation Ladder Scale ) well stable mood status ( Young Mania Rating Scale score eight less , Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale Score eight less , low score suicide aggression psychotic item four-week period require . Subjects receive pharmacological agent smoke cessation bupropion , nicotine replacement treatment , participate behavioral treatment smoke cessation three month begin study permit enroll study .

Chantix placebo administer use random assignment dose 0.5 mg mouth three day , follow 0.5 mg twice per day four day . After first week , dose increase 1 mg twice daily 11 week . Subjects must able tolerate minimum 1 mg per day continue study . Subjects pick target date visit 3 ( permit titration target dose 2 mg per day ) visit 4 quit smoking .

All visit schedule week apart subject continue take double-blind medication receive counseling session smoke cessation . Study medication stop 12 week , weekly visit evaluate abstinence . Some standard psychopathology rating scale smoke rating scale administer evaluate secondary aim degree nicotine withdrawal symptom impact residual symptom bipolar disorder . Safety assess administration specific mania depression rating scale include Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale , well comprehensive health assessment . This include medical history evaluation laboratory measure . Any adverse effect medication assess ask question visit necessary , contact subject phone outside schedule visit . SIGNIFICANCE The rate cigarette smoking among people psychiatric disorder remain exceedingly high ; nearly two four time high general population .
