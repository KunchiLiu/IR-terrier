	<brief_summary>The drug FEC 100 ( 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide ) one approve option treat Locally Advanced Primary Metastatic Breast Cancer . In study , investigator add another drug call Valproic Acid ( VPA ) see whether make treatment well . The addition Valproic Acid chemotherapy study 65 subject cancer find safe tolerable . Valproic Acid approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment seizure , mood swing , migraine headache . It currently approve cancer , investigator conduct study . The result Phase I study Valproic Acid FEC100 subject cancer spread lead investigator believe combination well standard treatment alone . The investigator test combination study subject either large tumor , many lymph node involve patient whose tumor spread . In addition treatment , main goal study find subject benefit combination . In Phase I trial investigator notice combination appear make chemotherapy effective , appear cause side effect induce chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valproic Acid Combination With FEC100 Primary Therapy Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year , 200,000 patient diagnose breast cancer . While recent advance diagnosis treatment render large proportion patient curable , many patient still present either locally advance metastatic breast cancer amenable potentially curative surgery . To enhance chance complete surgical resection tumor , patient large , locally advanced inflammatory breast cancer offer neo-adjuvant therapy . The use systemic chemotherapy surgical therapy patient operable disease associate 25 % -35 % reduction risk systemic relapse ( Early Breast Cancer Trialists ' Collaborative Group , 1998 ) Administration chemotherapy prior surgery , also refer neoadjuvant chemotherapy often use patient inoperable , non-metastatic breast cancer . However recently , neoadjuvant therapy become commonly use allows direct assessment response systemic therapy collection biological marker therapy otherwise difficult obtain . Furthermore , relative high response rate allow ability surgically remove tumor achieve adequate tumor-free margin .</detailed_description>
