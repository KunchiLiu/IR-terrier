	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study AS101 Treat Elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AML patient frequently develop cytopenia , result life-threatening bleeding infection . Despite administration prophylactic platelet transfusion , patient remain risk clinically significant hemorrhage . There grow need new , innovative strategy , outcome AML patient , particularly old one , substantially change last three decade . Thus , novel compound target tumor cell 's resistance chemotherapeutic agent essential improvement patient ' prognosis . AS101 non-toxic , organic , tellurium-based small compound immunomodulating property previously show bone marrow spar effect . In addition preclinical study AS101 show synergistic effect several cytotoxic drug . This study investigate safety efficacy AS101 formulation combination standard therapy newly diagnose elderly AML AML transform MDS patient .</detailed_description>
