	<brief_summary>Background : distal radial buckle fracture common injury child . ideal immobilization technique controversial . Few , retrospective study conduct evaluate bone heal cast versus splinting . However , impact immobilization technique daily function comfort evaluate . Objective : To compare impact daily function , comfort satisfaction cast versus splint child distal radial buckle fracture . Primary Hypothesis : Children short arm cast immobilize distal radial buckle fracture great reduction daily activity compare immobilized volar splint . Secondary Hypothesis : Children immobilize short arm cast less pain , less patient/parental satisfaction , adverse effect , few follow-up visit , long emergency department ( ED ) treatment time . Furthermore , hypothesize fracture acceptable alignment/healing follow-up orthopaedic clinic evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : A randomized control trial conduct child 2 17 year old radio graphically confirm distal radial buckle fracture . Exclusion criterion include skeletal maturity , previous distal radius fracture , concurrent fracture ( ) , osteogenesis imperfecta metabolic bone disease . Enrolled subject randomize receive either short arm cast volar wrist splint . The pediatric emergency department attend physician responsible apply directly supervise immobilization technique . All subject ' radiograph review pediatric orthopaedic surgeon 1 day confirm diagnosis measure fracture angulation . Those subject unacceptable angulation call ask return ED orthopaedic clinic re-evaluation . Outcomes Measures : The primary outcome measure Peds QL questionnaire assess impact daily function . This assessed baseline ED , phone 1 day , 3 day 1 week ED visit , orthopaedic clinic follow-up visit 3 week ED visit . Secondary outcome measure include questionnaire assess demographic data ( baseline ) , pain , satisfaction , adverse effect ( baseline , immediately immobilization apply , 1 day , 3days 1 week ED visit phone , 3 week orthopaedic clinic follow-up visit ) , ED treatment time ( ED prior discharge ) . At 3 week orthopaedic surgery clinic follow-up visit , assessment integrity immobilization technique conduct cast technician fracture alignment/healing range motion affect arm conduct pediatric orthopaedic surgeon blind treatment group .</detailed_description>
