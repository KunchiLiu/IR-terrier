	<brief_summary>To investigate effect anti-inflammatory therapy consist lenalidomide combination pioglitazone , dexamethasone metronomic low-dose chemotherapy treosulfan response rate patient relapse refractory progressive multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Phase I : determine lenalidomide dse phase II part ( 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg ) basis dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ' ) first 4 week treatment . Phase II : determine - response rate ( primary objective ) - time progression ( TTP ) - time partial response ( TPR ) - overall survival ( OS ) - quality life - tolerability safety</brief_summary>
