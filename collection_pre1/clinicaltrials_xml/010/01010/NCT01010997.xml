	<detailed_description>The FORESEE HOME intend early detection central paracentral irregularity ( abnormality ) visual field , commonly associate AMD . However , device ability detect development lesion post treatment therefore asses determination next treatment . The OCT May use well identify choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . Comparison two method allow well understanding device . The FORESEE HOME use assessment tool progression success treatment give AMD lesion . Therefore , evaluation size location treat lesion may serve additional tool .</detailed_description>
