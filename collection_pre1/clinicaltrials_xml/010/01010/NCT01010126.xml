	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well temsirolimus bevacizumab work treat patient advanced endometrial , ovarian , liver , carcinoid , islet cell cancer . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving temsirolimus together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Endometrial , Ovarian , Liver , Carcinoid , Islet Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate progression-free survival 6 month patient endometrial , ovarian , hepatocellular carcinoma , carcinoid islet cell cancer . II . To determine toxicity combination temsirolimus bevacizumab patient endometrial , ovarian , hepatocellular carcinoma , carcinoid islet cell cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect blood tumor specimens patient enter trial possible future analysis . OUTLINE : Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
