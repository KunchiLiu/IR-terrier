	<brief_summary>For patient initially present localize sarcoma standard care surgery follow radiation therapy ( feasible ) . Subsequent adjuvant cytotoxic base chemotherapy even aggressive sarcoma histopathologies ( commonly do colorectal cancer breast cancer ) controversial since 20 individual adjuvant randomize clinical trial able consistently demonstrate statistically significant improvement overall survival . Maturation differentiation therapy provide opportunity fundamentally change biology underlie cancer ( thus overall prognosis ) promote cellular maturation within cancer . A change poorly 'differentiated/high grade ' tumor well 'differentiated/low grade ' tumor attainable change individual 's median time survival month decade . The investigator significant preclinical data differentiation therapy use group drug refer histone deacetylase inhibitor ( Valproate , also commonly use safe anti seizure medication ) feasible sarcoma . This approach clinically address solid tumor . Since adjuvant therapy controversial sarcoma , build investigator ' preclinical data , adjuvant base differentiation therapy use valproate would predict safe potentially extremely beneficial term ) increase time disease recurrence , b ) improve histology upon recurrence ; c ) improve overall survival patient sarcomas . Patients high grade sarcoma receive Valproate adjuvant set daily clinically/radiologically follow recurrence . Relapse free survival , time local failure , time distant failure , overall survival , comparative histopathology primary recurrence assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Valproate High Grade Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant chemotherapy high grade soft tissue sarcomas controversial . Given fact approximately 50 % patient receive optimum treatment recur three year die recurrence within five year , smarter adjuvant option need . One treatment option would `` differentiate '' high grade sarcoma low grade sarcoma upon recurrence . This differentiation effect reduce risk subsequent death 50 % determine overall survival difference high grade/poorly differentiate low grade/ well differentiate sarcoma . Given differentiation take place time scale significantly longer cytotoxic effect , optimum time initiate differentiation therapy adjuvant setting ; time disease recurrence measure month year . The histone deacetylase inhibitor , Valproate , show promote differentiation myeloid malignancy administer standard dosing regiment . We recently show sarcoma conceptually similar hematopoietic malignancy , represent disease aberrant development develop cell along respective lineage arrest transform various point differentiation . We recently show vitro , acute promyelocytic leukemia , sarcoma reprogrammed reenter normal differentiation via epigenetic modulation use histone deacetylase inhibitor . It therefore appeal study Valproate base differentiation therapy adjuvant setting sarcoma .</detailed_description>
