	<brief_summary>The benefit laparoscopic ( `` minimally invasive '' `` keyhole '' ) surgery gallbladder removal ( cholecystectomy ) open surgical procedure term significant reduction pain , scar recovery time well accept . In conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy however , excise gallbladder still extract abdominal wall skin via laparoscopic port site use incision 10mm great . Despite much small require open surgery , incision painful , leave scar result port site hernia follow require surgery repair . Recent attempt reduce invasiveness surgical procedure suggest performing operation via endoscope pass mouth incision stomach wall - call Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) . Unlike skin incision , incision wall stomach ( gastrotomy ) give pain , visible scar herniation risk yet still allow access peritoneal cavity surgical procedure cholecystectomy . Against , potential risk contamination leakage gastric content peritoneal cavity . Whilst limitation present technology make difficult perform entire cholecystectomy stomach wall patient , endoscopic method close gastrotomy available approve use patient ( CE mark ) hypothesise remove excise gallbladder stomach way would avoid problem extract abdominal wall described . Data require determine whether extraction gallbladder via gastrotomy rather skin safe , produce small scar well cosmetic result . A secondary endpoint would assess possible reduction pain recovery less invasive approach .</brief_summary>
