	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose nelarabine give continuous infusion patient lymphoid malignancy respond , come back treatment chemotherapy . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) Study Nelarabine Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Nelarabine design interfere DNA ( genetic material cell ) stop growth rapidly divide cell , cancer cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level nelarabine base join study . Up 8 dose level nelarabine test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose nelarabine find . Study Drug Administration : You receive nelarabine non-stop infusion needle catheter vein Days 1-5 4 - 6 week cycle . You remain hospital infusion . You may receive ondansetron similar drug vein 30 minute receive nelarabine . This give help prevent nausea . You also take ondansetron similar drug mouth every 12 hour next 7 day need . If still nausea , give additional drug . If allergic , may receive allopurinol mouth Days 1-10 Cycles 1 . Allopurinol give help reduce risk much uric acid blood . If level uric acid blood high , may receive additional drug . You may also give drug help reduce risk infection . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test 1 hour , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10-18 hour study drug infusion . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . PD test measure level study drug body may affect disease On Days 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK PD test . On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug take transfusion may . - You ask side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Measurements lymph node , spleen , liver take . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test level antibodies T-cells ( type white blood cell ) blood . One ( 1 ) time week , often study doctor think need : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . After every 3 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug take transfusion may . - You ask side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Measurements lymph node , spleen , liver take . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You neurological exam ( test check function nerve , include test balance reflex ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check number T-cells blood . - You bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . - If NHL , CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Length Participation : You may continue receive nelarabine long study doctor think best interest . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Nelarabine , give injection , FDA approve treatment refractory relapse T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T lymphoblastic lymphoma . The use nelarabine continuous infusion investigational . Up 35 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must one follow relapsed/ refractory lymphoid malignancy : Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) Bprolymphocytic leukemia previously treat purine analog , candidate higher priority clinical study . Follicular lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma , lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma marginal zone lymphoma previously treat autologous allogeneic stem cell transplantation . 2 . Continued # 1 : Tcell prolymphocytic leukemia , large granular lymphocyte leukemia , mycosis fungoides / Sezary syndrome peripheral Tcell lymphoma previously treat least one line chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy . Tcell Bcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) previously treat least one line chemotherapy . 3 . Patients ( pediatrics adult ) must adequate renal function ( calculated creatinine clearance &gt; /= 50ml/min ) . For adult calculate per Cockcroft Gault formula pediatric case calculate per Schwartz formula . 4 . Patients must adequate hepatic function ( bilirubin &lt; /= 2 mg/dL ; SGOT SGPT &lt; /= 3X ULN reference lab unless due leukemia ) . 5 . Patients must adequate marrow function ( neutrophils &gt; /= 0.5x10^9/L platelet &gt; /= 50x10^9/L ) unless cytopenia deem due disease . 6 . Patients must adequate performance status ( Zubrod 02 ) . 7 . Female patient must pregnant lactating . Female patient childbearing potential ( include &lt; 1 year postmenopausal ) male patient must agree use contraception . 8 . Patients must sign informed consent form indicate aware investigational nature study , keep policy hospital . 1 . Patients must untreated uncontrolled lifethreatening infection . 2 . Patients know HIV positive know Hepatitis B and/or C exclude . 3 . Patients must receive systemic chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy within 2 week study enrollment . Patients previously receive bolus nelarabine still eligible . Hydroxyurea corticosteroid control blood count allow , must discontinue 24 hour prior initiate nelarabine . 4 . Patients must history grade &gt; /=2 neurological toxicity previous treatment , persistent grade &gt; /=2 peripheral neuropathy . Drowsiness lethargy exempt criterion unless previously persistent one week . 5 . Patients must uncontrolled central nervous system disease . Patients history seizure disorder must seizurefree one year prior enrolment . 6 . Patients must medical condition , include mental illness substance abuse , deem Investigator likely interfere patient 's ability give inform consent cooperate participate study interfere interpretation result .</criteria>
