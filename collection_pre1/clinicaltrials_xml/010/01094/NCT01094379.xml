	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy establish treatment choice symptomatic gallstone disease . The main advantage laparoscopic surgery cosmetic result , reduce postoperative pain , short hospital stay rapid return normal activity . Although reduce , however , pain still substantial constitutes main clinical problem laparoscopic cholecystectomy , especially plan day case procedure . Recently , new technique laparoscopic cholecystectomy develop , instrument insert umbilical incision . The single incision laparoscopic surgery ( SILS ) technique cholecystectomy prove feasible safe several study . However , moment randomize study standard SILS cholecystectomy publish . The primary end point study compare postoperative pain secondary end point operate time , nausea , vomit , tissue damage , pulmonary function , cosmetic result quality life . Patients admit laparoscopic cholecystectomy Aretaieion Hospital , care four surgeon , enter study sign consent obtain . Randomization carry preoperatively use block random number . Anaesthesia standardize . The waterproof dressing , site , apply patient order prevent nursing staff know variant operation carry . Postoperatively , patient receive identical protocol care . Postoperative pain assess use visual analogue pain score . The analgesia prescribe patient , require . Postoperative analgesia , nausea vomit record . Pulmonary function test measure , sit position , use spirometer operation . Tissue damage assess measure CRP Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Injury inflammation human body result increase concentration acute-phase reactant protein . CRP consistent response , therefore , satisfactory single screen test acute phase reactant . IL-6 one important mediator acute phase response . It secrete T cell macrophages stimulate immune response trauma . The cosmetic result assess patient . Quality-of-life assess use EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire preoperatively 1 week postoperatively . The EQ-5D questionnaire generic measure quality life , health status define term 5 dimension : mobility , self-care , usual activity , pain/discomfort anxiety/depression . Reevaluation patient take place 1 week 4 week operation outpatient clinic . If consider reduce postoperative pain 35 % , α : 0.05 β : 0.20 need 20 patient arm .</detailed_description>
