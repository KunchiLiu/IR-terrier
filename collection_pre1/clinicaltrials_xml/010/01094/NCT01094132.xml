	<brief_summary>Precancerous lesion cervix occur frequently treatable . This justify population-based screen program . Following abnormal Pap smear , patient refer colposcopic exam confirm presence/stage disease select appropriate treatment . Unfortunately , approach detect lesion sometimes give 'false positive ' result ( result overtreatment ) . We test device call 'multispectral digital colposcope ' determine whether effective detect precancerous cervical lesion exist tool . Success study make diagnosis accurate reduce cost associate unnecessary treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Digital Colposcopy Analysis Improve Cervical Precancer Cancer Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multispectral digital colposcope ( MDC ) specialize lightsource image device mount custom-made colposcope acquire sequence fluorescence image . The MDC also consist point probe use take detailed light measurement ( call spectroscopy ) small region cervix . The goal study see whether MDC perform good standard method detect cancerous pre-cancerous abnormality cervix . Study subject HPV swabbed . After vinegar apply cervix per usual colposcopy practice , MDC use take sequence image cervix . Next 2-4 reading take cervix use point probe . Study subject may also randomly ask additional picture take another imaging device . ) The Fast Fluorescence Camera ( FFC ) modify digital camera capture image similar MDC . It take pair image two different light condition - white light violet light , use MDC . b ) The Confocal Probe ( CP ) hand-held microscope use collect image location point probe . The cervix topically stain fluorescent dye ( Acriflavine ) take cell nuclei . The CP able capture , real time , image cell fluorescent nuclei . This data use train , test valid algorithm specific MDC . The ability algorithm detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia compare standard clinical care ( colposcopy ) . The MDC image pathology result compare spectroscopy data MDC probe . We determine spectroscopy equal sensitivity colposcopy detect high grade lesion .</detailed_description>
