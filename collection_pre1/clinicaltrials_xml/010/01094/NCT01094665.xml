	<detailed_description>This single center , single arm , open-label study evaluate safety feasibility MRI guide focal prostate cancer laser ablation patient focus prostate cancer yet receive treatment cancer . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion none clinical exclusion criterion enrol study ( legal representative ) sign informed consent form . No control group utilize patient receive MRI guide FLA focal prostate cancer . As part screen process , patient provide medical history undergo physical examination , include digital rectal examination ( DRE ) . At first visit , patient also give copy inform consent , copy quality life performance questionnaires assess urinary , rectal , erectile function ( IPSS questionnaire urinary , IIEF5 questionnaire erectile function , ) . MR image visit 2 serve determine single site prostate cancer localize . At visit 3 , 12 core transrectal u guide prostate biopsy confirm yet unilateral , unifocal histologically proven tumour site recognize MRI . On preoperative examination ( visit 4 ) - blood urine sample take prior procedure . Visit 5 - focal treatment perform regional general anesthesia , conscious sedation , ( determined anesthesiologist ) TGH research 1.5T MRI suite . MR guide FLA procedure similar MR guide brachytherapy , fiber probe insert transperineally outside bore MR patient move inside bore verify position deploy laser . The treatment expect last 2-3 hour , patient expect pain whole procedure . Laser ablation monitor use MR thermometry14 , 15.An MRI scan do immediately ablation , initial assessment ensure complete treatment target volume , well ensure treatment extend critical structure . The size location lesion compare plan target volume proximity lesion urethra rectum . If lesion encompass target volume , still safe distance either critical structure , FLA may continue . On day 3 , 7 , 30 , 120 follow procedure , patient assess clinical sign urinary , rectal , erectile complication complete validate self-assessment tool function . Free/Total PSA monitor visit -1 treatment day 7 , 30 120 , order try understand effect FLA PSA . Four month focal procedure , 12 core biopsy , plus 2 core aim ablated lesion preform verify oncological effectiveness treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men 4580 year age ; Histologically prove prostate carcinoma ; Prostate cancer clinical stage T1c T2a Prostate MRI must confirm area suspicious cancer sector positive biopsy ; Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level le 15 ng/mL 12 core biopsy , histologically proven prostate carcinoma , suspicious region MRI . IPSS IIEF complete prior procedure Life expectancy great 5 year , base comorbidity relate prostate cancer . Medically unfit focal therapy prostate Patients unwilling unable give inform consent ; Patients receive androgen suppression therapy Patients receive receive chemotherapy prostate carcinoma ; Patients previously treat surgery prostate ( traditional , endoscopic minimally invasive include HIFU , TUNA , RITA , microwave , TURP , cryotherapy curative treatment Patients undergone radiation therapy prostate cancer pelvis Any condition , history illness surgery , opinion Investigator , might confound result study pose additional risk patient ( e.g . significant cardiovascular condition allergy ) ; Patients history non compliance medical therapy and/or medical recommendation ; Patients unwilling unable complete patient selfassessment questionnaire ; Chronic acute prostatitis , neurogenic bladder , urinary tract infection , sphincter abnormality , symptom prevents normal micturition . Patients participate clinical study and/or receive treatment investigational treatment and/or product within past 90 day ; If patient unable undergo regional anesthesia Patients contraindication MRI ( i.e . pacemaker , hip prosthesis , severe claustrophobia , brain aneurysm clip , allergy MRI contrast agent ) Any condition , history illness , opinion investigator confound increase patient risk study</criteria>
