	<brief_summary>Central dopamine think play significant role obesity . In support idea , animal study one human positron emission tomography ( PET ) study find reduce postsynaptic D2-like receptor availability striatum obesity , low D2 receptor availability associate high weight . In addition , reward sensitivity hedonic response , know related dopamine function , also implicate obesity obesity-related eating behavior . These report lead concept dopaminergic abnormality ( e.g . reduce D2-like receptor ) influence reward sensitivity , lead alter eating behavior eventually obesity . However , several critical limitation human D2 receptor study limit strength conclusion thus interpretation speculation embed literature relies work . First , estimate D2-like receptor human confound potential difference endogenous dopamine release since PET ligand ( raclopride ) use know displaceable receptor endogenous dopamine . Second , failure rigorously screen obese individual diabetes confounds conclusion , since diabetes independently associate dopaminergic abnormality reduce D2-like receptor mute dopamine release diabetic rat . Finally , human study address whether reduce D2-like receptor level risk factor obesity , consequence engage obesity-related behavior obese .</brief_summary>
