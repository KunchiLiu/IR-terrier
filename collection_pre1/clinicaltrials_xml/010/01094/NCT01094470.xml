	<brief_title>Body Weight Support Training Ground Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals mechanically support BWS system walk ground level . All individual start train 30 % body weight unload three week , percentage reduce 20 % remainder six-week training period . The criterion use reduce percentage BWS individual 's ability maintain alignment trunk transfer weight paretic limb gait . Individuals ' body mass measure weekly ensure appropriate percentage body weight unload . During training session , physical therapist encourage individual walk fast possible , feedback provide order improve gait performance , vertical alignment trunk , symmetric limb weight distribution , proper movement low limb . Heart rate blood pressure observe begin end session , patient report symptoms discomfort session . Rest period allow training session accord individual need . All individual submit gait training session 45 minute , three time week , alternate day six week , complete total 18 session . None give type physical intervention conventional gait training , stretch , muscle strengthen endurance exercise participate study . In order verify effect describe gait training , individual assess gait training program , walk freely self-selected comfortable speed along 10 walkway six time . They videotape four digital camera ( AG-DVC7P , Panasonic ) 60 Hz , position bilaterally order allow simultaneous kinematics measurement paretic nonparetic limb either direction motion ( left right vice-versa ) . During evaluation , individual allow use assistive device , walk physical therapist ' assistance keep balance , necessary . Passive reflective marker place nonparetic paretic side body follow anatomical location : head fifth metatarsal , lateral malleolus , lateral epicondyle femur , great trochanter , acromion , order define foot , shank , thigh , trunk segment , respectively . The digitalization reconstruction marker perform use Ariel Performance Analysis System - APAS ( Ariel Dynamics , Inc. ) software , filter posterior analysis perform use Matlab software ( MathWorks , Inc. - Version 6.5 ) . Reconstruction real coordinate perform use direct linear transformation ( DLT ) procedure .</detailed_description>
