	<brief_title>Multicenter Clinical Efficacy Safety Study Delayed Release 6MP Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) therapy aim reduce inflammation via induction remission flare-up maintenance remission long possible . Therapies commonly use induce remission steroid anti-TNF-a . Standard 6MP , hand , slow onset action require several month administration therapeutic effect become apparent . Therefore , 6MP typically used maintenance therapy , rather remission . Furthermore , serious AE 's associate wtih 6MP include leucopenia , hepatoxicity , pancreatitis bone marrow suppression , require lower dose treatment discontinuation . The Teva DR-6MP project design evaluate new oral 6MP formulation would address limitation . The slow action standard 6MP , preclude use treatment induction remission , would offset faster-disintegrating , soluble formulation enteric coating target ileal delivery . This new formulation design open terminal ileum , commonly affect area CD bowel involvement , could deliver high effective local concentration drug site affect CD , stimulate effective local immunological response , result cascade widespread immunological activity , evoke induction remission . The safety standard 6MP would improve upon fact negligible level DR-6MP formulation observe plasma , obviate toxicity associate systemic 6MP . Moreover , since DR-6MP dose fix subject patient weight , potentially , side-effects , dose adjustment require up-titration optimal dose , down-titration due toxicity , could avoid . Previous small , pilot proof-of-concept clinical efficacy pharmacokinetic study DR-6MP formulation demonstrate potential induction remission , mucosal healing , systemic immunological improvement low systemic side-effects . The current study design repeat earlier study large , rigorous condition randomize , double-blind fashion multiple site ascertain initial encouraging result could repeat . Moreover , high dose 6MP ( 80 mg ) test ascertain presumably higher local concentration disease site evince robust clinical effect .</detailed_description>
