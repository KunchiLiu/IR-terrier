	<brief_title>Switching Drug Therapy Prevention Blood Clot Formation From Enoxaparin Rivaroxaban After Orthopedic Surgery Either Total Hip Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study medication , rivaroxaban , oral ( mouth ) medication . Rivaroxaban directly inhibit one clotting mechanism blood involve formation blood clot vein body . The ability inhibit blood clotting measure . Rivaroxaban currently approve European Union European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) prevention blood clot vein orthopedic ( bone ) surgical patient elective total joint ( hip knee ) replacement . It currently review Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) United States indication . Enoxaparin medication inject fat tissue skin approve FDA treatment prevention blood clot formation vein . The goal study describe short-term effect study drug body patient switch enoxaparin rivaroxaban . The study hypothesis , theory , switch enoxaparin rivaroxaban ability body inhibit blood clotting activity continue . This open-label study mean person involve study know study drug give . It single-arm study mean patient administer study medication , rivaroxaban . The study conduct large orthopedic center United States . All patient elective total hip total knee replacement surgery . While hospital , eligible patient receive enoxaparin either 30 mg twice day 40 mg daily . Upon discharge hospital eligible patient require stay subacute unit continue medication blood clot prevention . After provide write informed consent , patient screen procedure complete determine eligibility . Safety evaluation screen procedure include physical examination , vital sign , clinical blood laboratory test . Women , able bear child , also screen blood pregnancy test perform . A negative pregnancy test need study . Just receive first dose rivaroxaban , 10 mg , blood sample short-term effect rivaroxaban begin continue various time . All patient receive 10 mg rivaroxaban daily . In addition , study doctor assessment surgical wound . At time discharge subacute unit , study doctor feel appropriate , adequate supply rivaroxaban provide complete full course therapy . If patient withdraws his/her consent prior completion study , appropriate course blood clot prevention therapy prescribe study doctor . Upon completion rivaroxaban therapy , patient require final study procedure perform . Those patient continue oral rivaroxaban discharge subacute unit required return office visit final study procedure either time completion rivaroxaban therapy surgical follow-up visit . Patients rivaroxaban discontinue prior discharge subacute unit final study procedure complete time subsequent office visit require . In case , prescribed rivaroxaban therapy must complete prior time final visit . Safety evaluations final visit include clinical laboratory blood test , physical examination , urine pregnancy test ( applicable ) , record adverse event include detail regard bleed episode blood clot event , assessment surgical wound . All patient return unused study medication study participation complete . All patient receive oral rivaroxaban 10mg daily . First dose rivaroxaban give within 2 day admission subacute unit , morning within 12 hr ( 30mg twice day ) 24 hour ( 40mg daily ) enoxaparin dose . Patients continue receive daily 10 mg dose morning . The total duration combine therapy ( enoxparin plus rivaroxaban ) may exceed 35 day patient total hip replacement 14 day total knee replacement .</detailed_description>
