	<brief_title>Effect ATI-7505 Gastrointestinal Transit Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ATI-7505 , engineer analog 5-HT4 agent , cisapride . The objective study compare effect ATI-7505 placebo gastric , small bowel colonic transit healthy human volunteer evaluate safety tolerability ATI-7505 . This trial double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study evaluate gastrointestinal transit effect ATI-7505 placebo . Three different dos ( 3 , 10 , 30mg ) ATI-7505 placebo administer parallel four independent group 12 subject . The maximum duration drug exposure subject 9 day . All participant undergo standard 48 hour gastrointestinal transit measurement use scintigraphy standardize meal first 12 hour . The response endpoint ( colonic geometric center 4 h , colonic geometric center 24 h , colonic geometric center 48 h , gastric residual 2 &amp; 4 h , colonic fill 6 h ascend colonic empty t1/2 ) base abdominal scintigraphic image follow technetium-99m egg meal methacrylate-coated , delayed-release capsule contain 111In label activated charcoal . Safety tolerability evaluate serial assessment vital sign , physical examination , ECG , adverse event , concomitant medication blood sample analysis .</detailed_description>
