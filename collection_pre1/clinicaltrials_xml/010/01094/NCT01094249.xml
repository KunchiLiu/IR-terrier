	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study Valproic Acid Paliperidone Extended-Release ( ER ) Patients With Schizophrenia , Bipolar I Disorder , Schizoaffective Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( patient know identity study drug take ) study patient diagnose either schizophrenia , bipolar I disorder , schizoaffective disorder currently receive treatment valproic acid , sodium valproate , divalproex sodium . The primary purpose study determine effect , , multiple dos paliperidone extend release ( ER ) tablets pharmacokinetics ( ie , blood level ) valproic acid administer study divalproex sodium extend release ( ER ) . Divalproex sodium consist compound sodium valproate valproic acid 1:1 molar relationship enteric coat form . Approximately 16 patient take part study . The study last approximately 41 day participation study require minimum 5 overnight stay maximum 13 overnight stay study drug treatment . The study consist screen period occur 21 day study treatment , 13-day treatment period , posttreatment period include follow-up visit 1 week end-of-treatment procedure perform . The purpose screening visit see patient meet requirement participate study . At screen visit , patient read provide write informed consent acknowledge willingness participate study , follow procedure perform : 1 ) information regard medical , psychiatric , surgical history medication currently take collect , 2 ) physical examination perform , 3 ) vital sign ( blood pressure ) electrocardiogram ( ECG , painless test measure electrical activity heart ) assess , 4 ) blood sample routine laboratory test well test hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( check pregnancy woman child-bearing potential ) collect , 5 ) urine sample collect routine laboratory test include test drug abuse , 6 ) alcohol breath test perform . Patients meet entry criterion study ask check-in study clinic evening first administration study drug stay overnight clinic least 5 day Day 13 ( approximately 2 week ) . During overnight stay clinic , patient require eat drink meal beverage provide clinic . Patients take study drug orally ( mouth ) follow order day specify : divalproex sodium ER daily 7 day ( Day 1 Day 7 ) follow divalproex sodium ER daily combination paliperidone ER daily 7 day ( ie , Days 8 Day 12 ) . During study , patient blood sample take vein arm use needle ( flexible tube ) specify time study determine concentration drug blood . On Day 13 ( time early withdrawal study ) last blood sample drug level collect , patient undergo end-of-study procedure include physical examination , measurement vital sign , ECG . A blood urine sample routine laboratory test also collect end-of-study procedure check patient general health ( check pregnancy woman child-bearing potential ) . After end-of-study procedure complete , patient leave study clinic return 1 week posttreatment follow-up visit overall general condition occurrence adverse event assess . The primary objective study assess potential effect multiple dose paliperidone ER tablet steady state pharmacokinetics VPA . Steady state achieve drug concentration blood stable ( ie , rate drug absorption equal rate drug elimination body ) . Patients also monitor safety time sign inform consent form end study ( ie , posttreatment follow visit ) . Safety include monitor adverse event , change clinical laboratory test result , ECG parameter , vital sign measurement , physical examination finding , severity patient general condition , concomitant medication ( medication study drug take patient ) throughout study period . All patient receive single oral ( mouth ) daily dose divalproex sodium ER ( dose depend patient prescreening therapeutic dose ) Days 1 7 divalproex sodium ER daily combination one 12mg tablet paliperidone ER daily Days 8 12 . All study drug swallow whole water .</detailed_description>
