	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Hyperthermia therapy kill tumor cell heat several degree normal body temperature . Drugs use chemotherapy , mitomycin C epirubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Biological therapy , bacillus calmette-guerin ( BCG ) interferon alfa , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . It yet know whether give hyperthermia together mitomycin C effective give BCG standard therapy second-line therapy treat patient recurrent bladder cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well hyperthermia give together mitomycin C work compare BCG standard therapy second-line therapy treat patient recurrent bladder cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether hyperthermia combination mitomycin C versus bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) standard therapy second-line therapy effective patient recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer follow induction maintenance therapy BCG . - To compare disease-free survival time patient . - To compare complete response rate 3 month patient carcinoma situ . Secondary - To compare progression-free survival , overall survival , safety tolerability treatment , quality life , cost , cost-effectiveness patient . - To assess biomarkers response standard investigational treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord presence carcinoma situ ( yes v ) , prior bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) therapy ( induction v maintenance ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( experimental ) : Patients receive intravesical mitomycin C two 30-minute instillation per session , bladder hyperthermia ( 42 +/-2°C ) deliver combination instillation . The suspension maintain bladder 2 hour . Treatment repeat week 6 week follow 6-week rest period . Patients disease-free proceed maintenance therapy consist one instillation mitomycin C bladder hyperthermia every 6 week 1 year every 8 week 1 year . Patients disease-free 24 month may continue treatment discretion clinician . - Arm II ( control ) : Patients receive 1 follow treatment regimen depend prior BCG treatment . - Second course BCG therapy ( patient fail previous induction BCG ) : Patients receive intravesical BCG ( 1 instillation ) week 6 week . The suspension maintain bladder 2 hour . Patients receive maintenance therapy consist BCG week 3 week month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 . Patients disease-free 24 month may continue treatment discretion clinician . - Standard therapy ( patient fail previous maintenance BCG ) : Patients receive standard therapy BCG failure define treating center . Standard therapy may include intravesical BCG alone , intravesical mitomycin C alone , intravesical epirubicin hydrochloride alone , intravesical BCG combination interferon alpha . All patient undergo cystoscopic surveillance without biopsy every 3 month 2 year . Urine , blood , tissue sample collect periodically biomarker laboratory study . Patients complete quality life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-BLS24 , QLQ-C30 , EQ5D ) baseline , 12 week , 6 , 9 , 12 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK</detailed_description>
