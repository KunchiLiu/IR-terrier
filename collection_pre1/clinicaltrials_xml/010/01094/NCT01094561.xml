	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate utility Secretin-Stimulated Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography ( S-MRCP ) detect carcinoma precancerous lesion patient significant family history pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Our hypothesis S-MRCP superior traditional compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detect early pancreatic neoplasm , approach accuracy endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer remain fourth lead cause cancer-related death United States , largely due lack accurate cost-effective screening method . Initial screen effort direct patient know increased genetic risk pancreatic adenocarcinoma . About 10-20 % pancreatic cancer consider familial syndromic . Since pancreatic adenocarcinoma know progress preneoplastic lesion , term pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PanIN ) , may eventually possible identify cure patient detect preneoplastic lesion . Traditional radiological method lack resolution detect early lesion . The sensitivity specificity endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) ( 92 % ,96 % ) EUS ( 93-98 % ) good , procedure invasive limited availability . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) emerge widely-accepted alternative comparable sensitivity ERCP . Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) augment secretin stimulation , improve visualization pancreatic duct well side branch . We recruit 25 patient prospective pilot study examine S-MRCP screening technique high-risk individual . All recruit patient undergo S-MRCP conjunction magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) /magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) , well secretin-enhanced EUS ( S-EUS ) . Those patient abnormality S-MRCP S-EUS undergo ERCP . If ERCP also show abnormality , patient recommend total subtotal pancreatectomy . The primary outcome study concordance S-MRCP EUS . Secondarily , measure positive predictive value S-MRCP , comparison EUS ERCP identify neoplasm patient undergo surgical resection study .</detailed_description>
