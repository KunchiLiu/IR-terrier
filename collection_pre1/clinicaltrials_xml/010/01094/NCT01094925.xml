	<brief_summary>Gabapentin effective treating pain knee hip operation , hysterectomy , many type operation . A previous study investigator ' hospital find single pre-operative dose 600mg gabapentin produce significant reduction pain caesarean section . However , 19 % complained sedation . The purpose study see whether reduce dose gabapentin produce similar improvement pain score avoid adverse effect sedation dizziness . The objective study compare efficacy single pre-operative oral dose gabapentin 300mg , versus 600mg placebo woman undergo Cesarean section .

	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Gabapentin Post-operative Pain Following Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative pain great fear woman undergo Cesarean section , despite current analgesic regimen , pain severe , impede mother 's recovery ability bond breastfeed new infant . Opioids mainstay treatment currently , , although effective , drug significant adverse effect , include sedation , nausea , vomit constipation . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) reduce opioid consumption , also side effect , contra-indicated significant number patient . Therefore remain considerable scope improve post-Cesarean analgesia . It show severe acute post-operative pain Cesarean section increase risk develop chronic pain post-partum depression . A recent study show 18 % woman persistent pain Cesarean section , severe acute post-operative pain significant risk factor . Gabapentin use widely treat chronic pain , demonstrate effective treat acute post-operative pain follow variety surgical procedure , significant reduction opioid consumption . Side effect uncommon ; likely dizziness sedation . Gabapentin cross placenta breast milk , evidence adverse maternal neonatal effect woman take gabapentin pregnancy . Gabapentin use successfully treat pain neonate . A recent study Mount Sinai Hospital compare single pre-operative dose 600mg gabapentin versus placebo woman undergo Cesarean section . Women gabapentin group report significantly improve pain score movement 48 hour surgery . Side effect similar group apart increase somnolence gabapentin group . The objective study compare efficacy single pre-operative oral dose gabapentin 300mg , versus 600mg placebo woman undergo Cesarean section . Our hypothesis gabapentin 300mg result decrease pain score similar gabapentin 600mg , reduce side effect . We design randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study aim answer question . Aside administration gabapentin one hour prior surgery , change standard protocol anaesthetic care . Women follow 48 hour surgery assessment pain score overall satisfaction . A follow-up three month determine incidence chronic pain . Few study examine incidence chronic pain follow Cesarean section , none examine impact pre-emptive analgesia use gabapentin incidence chronic pain follow Cesarean section . As rate Cesarean section continue increase , remain significant problem current analgesic regimen , use gabapentin , drug proven effectiveness post-surgical pain limited side effect , potential considerably improve acute chronic post-Cesarean pain , lead widespread change clinical practice .</detailed_description>
