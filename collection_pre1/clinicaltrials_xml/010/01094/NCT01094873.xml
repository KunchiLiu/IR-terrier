	<brief_summary>HCV002TV Phase I study ascertain safety immunogenicity novel vaccine Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) chronically infected patient . The vaccine base sequential delivery , intramuscular route , two different adenoviral vector , chimpanzee human origin respectively , bear genetic information HCV antigens ( NS region ) . The two recombinant vaccine vector , call AdCh3NSmut Ad6NSmut , weaken unable multiply within body ; design induce immune response HCV proteins . AdCh3NSmut Ad6NSmut use ongoing HCV001 study healthy volunteer good safety immunogenicity result . HCV002TV dose-escalation study ; AdCh3NSmut administer prim vaccination Ad6NSmut boost vaccination . The trial include : - Arm A , vaccinated patient Interferon-ribavirin therapy ( gold standard therapy hepatitis C ) ; - Arm B , vaccinate patient therapy .</brief_summary>

Vaccination occur week 14 IFNalpha ribavirin therapy . Resident near trial site duration vaccination study Able willing ( Investigator 's opinion ) comply study requirement For woman child bear potential , willingness practice continuous effective contraception study negative pregnancy test day ( ) vaccination For men use barrier contraception three month last vaccination Written inform consent The patient may enter study follow apply : Participation another research study involve investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan use study period Prior receipt recombinant simian human adenoviral vaccine Clinical , biochemical , ultrasonographic , liver biopsy ( histology ) evidence cirrhosis portal hypertension Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) Patients likely infected HCV within last 12 month History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine , e.g. , Kathon Patients fail respond ( nonresponders ) previous IFNalpha monotherapy Patients receive IFNalpha ribavirin past nonresponders relapse therapy History clinically significant contact dermatitis For Arm A , patient must treatment naïve ( i.e . never previous IFNα ribavirin treatment ) . Arm B may include patient previously treat HCV fail achieve sustain virological response ( define undetectable HCV PCR 6 month post cessation treatment ) Any history anaphylaxis reaction vaccination Pregnancy , lactation willingness/intention become pregnant study History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision Suspected known current alcohol abuse define alcohol intake great 42 unit every week Current suspect known injecting drug abuse Seropositive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Seropositive HIV ( antibody HIV ) screen Seropositive simian adenovirus 3 ( antibody AdCh3 ) titres &gt; 200 , screen Seropositive human adenovirus 6 ( antibody Ad6 ) titres &gt; 200 , screen Any significant disease , disorder finding , , opinion Investigator , may either put patient risk participation study , may influence result study , patient 's ability participate study Any finding opinion investigator would significantly increase risk adverse outcome participate protocol Individuals temperature &gt; 38°C 3 day precede vaccination .</criteria>
