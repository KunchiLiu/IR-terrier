	<brief_summary>The major purpose study examine anti-tumor activity CDX-1307 vaccine regimen give bladder cancer surgery . The study also provide information safety vaccine regimen give combination chemotherapy , affect immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CDX-1307 Vaccine Regimen Patients With Newly Diagnosed Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer ( The `` N-ABLE '' Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CDX-1307 experimental vaccine design generate immune response protein call human chorionic gonadotropin-beta ( hCG-β ) . hCG-β make several type cancer , include bladder cancer , show associated short time development metastasis reduce survival bladder cancer . In study , hop administer CDX-1307 vaccine cause body 's immune system attack bladder cancer cell order kill otherwise keep spread come back . Standard treatment early stage , muscle invasive bladder cancer include administration chemotherapy shrink tumor follow surgical removal bladder ( cystectomy ) . This study compare effect add CDX-1307 administration standard treatment . CDX-1307 give 3 different immune stimulant try increase immune response tumor cell ; collectively , call `` CDX-1307 vaccine regimen . '' Only patient whose tumor make hCG-β protein include study . Eligible patient receive `` standard care '' chemotherapy CDX-1307 vaccine regimen surgery , CDX-1307 vaccine regimen alone ( without chemotherapy ) surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Among criterion , patient must meet following condition eligible study : 1 . 18 year age old . 2 . Newly diagnose muscleinvasive transitional cell ( urothelial ) bladder cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy radical cystectomy curative intent indicate ( i.e. , American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stage T24a , Nany , M0 ) . Patients must enter study within eight week recent diagnostic procedure , usually diagnostic biopsy transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) procedure . 3 . Histopathologically confirm , transitional cell ( urothelial ) carcinoma . Urothelial tumor mixed histology ( &lt; 50 % variant ) eligible . 4 . Tumor tissue ( obtain prior procedure ) confirm express hCGβ central laboratory . 5 . Candidate therapy neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Among criterion , patient meet follow condition NOT eligible study : 1 . Previous systemic chemotherapy radiation bladder cancer . Note : Prior immunotherapy intravesical ( administer within bladder ) chemotherapy superficial disease acceptable . 2 . History anaphylactic reaction follow exposure humanize human therapeutic monoclonal antibody , hypersensitivity GMCSF yeast derive product , clinically meaningful allergic reaction imiquimod , resiquimod , know hypersensitivity prior reaction formulation excipients study drug . 3 . Concurrent chronic treatment immunosuppressive immunomodulatory agent , include systemic steroid ( exception : inhale topically applied steroid , acute chronic standard dose NSAIDs , permit ) . 4 . Known infection HIV , HBV HCV . 5 . Any underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study vaccine hazardous patient , would obscure interpretation adverse event , would contraindicate receipt neoadjuvant chemotherapy surgical resection .</criteria>
