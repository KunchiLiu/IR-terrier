	<brief_title>Adjustable Gastric Banding Its Effects Postprandial Glucose Metabolism Independent Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim application determine mechanism ( ) common bariatric surgical procedure alter carbohydrate metabolism . Very often , resolution diabetes occur early post-operative period prior development significant weight loss . It suggest bariatric surgery alters insulin action study examine insulin secretion postprandial glucose fluxes patient . At present time , little know various bariatric surgical procedure alter glucose homeostasis . It essential effect bariatric surgery meal size parameter understand accurately measure . Enteroendocrine secretion affect rate intestinal delivery calorie may also modulate enteric nervous system rate direct delivery nutrient enteroendocrine cell . Direct measurement intestinal transit also important part understand bariatric surgery alters intestinal secretion hormone may alter glucose metabolism . The Oral C-peptide Minimal Models apply C-peptide , glucose insulin concentration ingestion standard label mixed meal accurately measure insulin secretion action . Subsequently , disposition index provide measurement appropriateness insulin secretion prevail insulin action . When couple establish triple-tracer methodology , mixed meal use measure fast postprandial glucose flux . The present experiment determine mechanism glucose lower adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) . AGB seem superior medical therapy type 2 diabetes . However , bariatric surgery compare intensive effort weight reduction ameliorates diabetes cardiovascular risk . It therefore unknown beneficial effect AGB glucose metabolism relate weight-loss per se rather direct effect AGB .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals age 30 65 year see Nutrition Clinic Mayo Clinic , potentially eligible prior undergo adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) . We recruit 20 subject fast glucose concentration 126 mg/dl two occasion history type 2 diabetes treat one two oral agent thiazolidinediones . Potential participant attend Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) screen visit . In addition , investigator also recruit 20 subject type 2 diabetes , Nutrition Clinic interested pursue surgical intervention . The 2 group match age , gender BMI duration severity ( HbA1c . oral medication need achieve glycemic control ) diabetes . Subjects le 30 year age insulin study minimize possibility type 1 diabetes . Subjects older 65 year age study minimize potential confounding effect age glucose tolerance . Healthy status indicate participant know active systemic illness history microvascular macrovascular complication diabetes .</criteria>
