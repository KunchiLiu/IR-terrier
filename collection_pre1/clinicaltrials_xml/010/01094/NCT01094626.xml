	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate utility secretin-enhanced MRI ( S-MRI ) detect measure pancreatic lesion patient know adenocarcinoma Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) lesion . The hypothesis S-MRI superior MRI without secretin enhancement ( N-MRI ) increase tumor conspicuity , allow improve identification accurate measurement lesion precursor lesion pancreas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Secretin-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( S-MRI ) Pancreatic Cancer Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer remain fourth lead cause cancer-related death United States mark advanced stage diagnosis high mortality rate . Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) cystic lesion potentially cancerous , leading pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Currently , exist image modality sensitive cost-effective enough accurately measure detect adenocarcinoma IPMN . Improving method use identification localization disease critical . Secretin , hormone produce duodenal mucosal cell increase blood-flow pancreas . The investigator ' hypothesis secretin increase blood flow pancreas , increase conspicuity area dysplasia/cancer minimal blood-flow , enhance tumor detection . The investigator conduct prospective , randomized-control pilot study thirty subject IPMN pancreatic cancer undergo surgical resection Columbia University 's Pancreas Center . Fifteen subject randomly select undergo S-MRI prior surgery fifteen subject select control , undergo MRI without secretin-enhancement matched age , sex , race tumor-type . The investigator first evaluate secretin allows increase tumor conspicuity , enhance visualization lesion , compare calculated tumor conspicuity S-MRI N-MRI group . The investigator ass S-MRI image allows increase accuracy lesion measurement look concordance measurement S-MRI tumor specimens post-resection compare concordance measurement N-MRI tumor specimens post-resection .</detailed_description>
