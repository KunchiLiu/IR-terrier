	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Pain Palliation Benefit Adding Custirsen Docetaxel Retreatment Cabazitaxel Second Line Therapy Men With Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter , international trial enrol patient metastatic CRPC response first-line docetaxel therapy prostate cancer-related pain progression disease . The intended intervention second-line treatment docetaxel retreatment cabazitaxel plus study agent , custirsen administer investigational arm placebo administer control arm . Selection chemotherapy ( docetaxel re-treatment cabazitaxel ) determine treat physician , base patient 's first-line response . The study primarily assess pain analgesic use evaluation durable pain palliation response study treatment . Pain analgesic use obtain via 3rd party contact center ( direct contact patient ) . Study treatment start Loading Dose Period three infusion study agent ( custirsen vs. placebo ) administer . Following Loading Dose Period , study treatment consist docetaxel cabazitaxel 21-day cycle weekly study agent ( custirsen vs. placebo ) infusion Day 1 , 8 15 21-day cycle oral prednisone BID . Patients continue study treatment pain progression , unacceptable toxicity , completion 10 cycle specific criterion withdrawal identify protocol . If study treatment complete discontinue prior pain progression , 6-day assessment continue every 3 week pain progression document . Follow-up study treatment occur safety parameter 3 week last study agent infusion patient . Survival status update report every 12 week follow documentation pain progression . The amount time patient remain study vary ; average survival patient receive second line taxane treatment expect 14 15 month .</detailed_description>
