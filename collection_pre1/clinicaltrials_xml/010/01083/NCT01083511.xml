	<brief_summary>The study conduct nasopharyngeal swab specimen collect prospectively individual suspect acute respiratory tract infection cause Influenza virus . A series standard viral culture test validate routine use clinical laboratory , well CDC swine H1N1 test use establish collection well characterize specimen . For specimen four ( 4 ) aliquot prepare . One aliquot test real-time use requisite viral culture reference method , one aliquot use H1N1 reference testing , one aliquot use extract nucleic acid real-time , one aliquot UTM archive purpose sequence confirm Influenza-positive specimen . The extracted nucleic acid remain specimen store -70°C later test artus Influenza RG PCR test , investigational method ( ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each year morbidity mortality associate respiratory tract infection fluctuate seasonally . This rise fall associate change prevalence respiratory virus population . Myriad respiratory virus responsible infection . For example , Influenza Virus , Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) , Parainfluenza Virus , Human Metapneumovirus , Rhinovirus , Adenovirus identify cause infection . Numerous pathogenic subtypes identify within viral group . Apart supportive measure ( e.g. , bed rest , hydration , etc . ) , effective treatment viral infection ; however , antiviral agent ( e.g. , Tamiflu ) use alleviate severity flu-like symptom . Each year virus population fluctuates , antigenic presentation dominant strain circulate population . Epidemics arise large large portion population innate acquire resistance strain ( ) give season . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) maintain separate website dedicate track outbreak influenza , especially avian influenza ( http : //www.who.int/fluvirus_tracker ) . Influenza outbreak monitor hope pandemic similar Spanish Flu 1918 avoid ; estimate well 25 million people die Spanish Flu . The United States government also maintain separate website resource regard flu pandemic relate information ( http : //www.pandemicflu.gov/ ) . On June 11 , 2009 WHO raise pandemic threat level 6 response global appearance new strain swine Influenza A ( subtype H1N1 ) . The rapidity H1N1 virus spread exemplifies notion quickly accurately identify virus associate outbreak critical global public health . In present study collection respiratory specimen well characterize archive later evaluation use artus® Influenza RG PCR test . The artus Influenza test real-time PCR test identifies Influenza A , Influenza B , Influenza Type A/subtype H1N1 nasopharyngeal swab specimen .</detailed_description>
