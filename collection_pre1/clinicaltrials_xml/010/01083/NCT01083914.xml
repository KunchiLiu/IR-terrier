	<brief_title>Comparing Blood Loss , RBC Transfusions Inflammatory Marker Changes Among Methods CPB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( OPCAB ) use minimal extracorporeal circulation system ( MECC ) propose alternative avoid harmful effect conventional cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . However , technically demand nature off-pump CABG , potential short-term benefit off-pump surgery may translate long-term benefit provide optimal revascularization . In prospective cohort study , goal evaluate short term outcome demonstrate blood loss , transfusion need , systemic inflammatory response CABG surgery use MECC conventional CPB OPCAB . In addition technical challenge pose off-pump CABG surgery , also know significant systemic inflammatory response mount patient undergo conventional CPB . This inflammatory response combine effect 1 ) placement require tubes line connection heart/lung machine , 2 ) hemodilution , 3 ) hypothermia . In study , measure level tissue inflammation use specialized laboratory test ( C Reactive Protein , C5 complement activation Interleukin 6 ) , correlate inflammation level three different cardiopulmonary bypass option . It hypothesis MECC provide stable operating environment conventional CPB patient benefit less blood loss , decrease transfusion rate , decrease inflammation level see patient OPCAB . Statistical Analysis : Multivariable regression model use investigate association MECC pump , conventional CPB versus off-pump outcome control risk factor recognize STS associate post-CABG adverse outcome ) clinical non-clinical factor . The association outcome interest MECC versus conventional CPB MECC versus off-pump estimate 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) . With cohort 102 patient ( 34 three study group ) 80 % power detect 71 % relative reduction ( 30 % absolute difference ) transfusion rate among CABG patient use MECC pump compare conventional pump patient assume 42 % patient undergoing CABG conventional pump require transfusion</detailed_description>
