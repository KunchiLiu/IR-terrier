	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To improve overall survival patient post-transplant relapse myeloid malignancy . OUTLINE : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
