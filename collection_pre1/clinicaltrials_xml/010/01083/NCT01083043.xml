	<brief_summary>It well known lower average blood glucose decrease risk diabetic complication involve small vessel , find eye , nerve kidney . It less clear however , control fluctuation blood glucose help prevent complication . The purpose study examine relationship extreme fluctuation glucose damage blood vessel lining .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies show glycemic variability associate oxidative stress turn correlate endothelial damage . Further , endothelial damage identify critical event lending way vascular complication see many disease state . The specific aim study investigate relationship short-term glycemic variability biomarkers endothelial dysfunction analyze influence different variable adjust covariates . Data obtain continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) , device continuously record interstitial glucose 72 hour period , use calculate glycemic variability . Serology determination endothelial dysfunction biomarkers obtain day three . Pearson Spearman Rank Order correlation utilized determine whether significant correlation measure glycemic variability biomarker level endothelial dysfunction . Multiple regression analysis would also determine glycemic variability predicts elevate biomarker level even control variable . Provided high prevalence diabetic complication stagger socioeconomic cost , important elucidate relationship glycemic variability endothelial dysfunction .</detailed_description>
