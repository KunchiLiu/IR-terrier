	<brief_summary>Cardiac arrest lead cause sudden death , survival rate cardiac arrest 5-35 % . Although , first resuscitation cardiac arrest patient would success , hypoxic brain injury cardiac arrest important cause mortality morbidity . For management hypoxic brain injury cardiac arrest , American Heart Association European Resuscitation Council recommend induce mild hypothermia therapy . And , ILCOR ( International Liaison Committee Resuscitation ) announce standard treatment post cardiac arrest syndrome ( success state first resuscitation cardiac arrest patient ) include induced mild hypothermia therapy September , 2008 . The generalized seizure myoclonus arise 60 % post cardiac arrest syndrome patient difficult control . Also , occurrence implies poor prognosis patient . Although , mild hypothermia therapy could decrease development propagation generalize seizure myoclonus theologically , therapy could prevent development propagation entirely . Therefore , use prophylactic anticonvulsant need . But , randomize control study use prophylactic anticonvulsant . We hypothesize use prophylactic anticonvulsant post cardiac arrest syndrome patient would decrease rate occurrence generalize seizure myoclonus would improve neurologic outcome . We plan use two anti-epileptic drug - valproate , clonazepam - prophylactic anticonvulsant . The valproate clonazepam general use prevention treatment generalized seizure myoclonus recommend treat generalized seizure myoclonus post cardiac arrest syndrome patient 2008 guideline ILCOR .</brief_summary>
