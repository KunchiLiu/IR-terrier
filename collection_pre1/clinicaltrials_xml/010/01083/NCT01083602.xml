	<criteria>1 . Patient previous diagnosis multiple myeloma , base IMWG 2003 definition . All three follow criterion must meet : Monoclonal immunoglobulin ( M component ) electrophoresis , immunofixation serum total 24 hour urine Bone marrow ( clonal ) plasma cell ≥ 10 % biopsy proven plasmacytoma Related organ tissue impairment ( CRAB symptom : anemia , hypercalcemia , lytic bone lesion , renal insufficiency , hyperviscosity , amyloidosis recurrent infection ) 2 . Patient must relapse refractory MM must require treatment relapsed disease 3 . Patients must receive least 2 prior line therapy include IMiD ( thalidomide lenalidomide ) 4 . Patient must refractory last bortezomib contain line therapy give relapse refractory setting define : progress within 60 day last bortezomibcontaining line therapy 5 . Patient measurable disease M protein study screen define least one follow measurement per threshold clarify IMWG 2003 disease definition ( Kyle , et al 2003 ) : Serum Mprotein ≥ 1 g/dL ( ≥ 10 g/L ) Urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 h 6 . Patients treat local radiotherapy without concomitant exposure steroid pain control management cord/nerve root compression , eligible . Two week must lapse since last date radiotherapy , recommend limited field . Patients require concurrent radiotherapy entry protocol defer radiotherapy complete 2 week pass since last date therapy 7 . Patient 's age ≥ 18 year time signing inform consent 8 . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) ≤ 2 9 . Patient follow laboratory value within 3 week start study drug ( lab test may repeat , clinically indicate , obtain acceptable value screen fail conclude supportive therapy administer within week prior screen test absolute neutrophil count platelet count ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 109 /L Platelet count ≥ 70 x 109 /L Serum potassium , magnesium , phosphorus , within normal limit ( WNL ) institution Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ionize calcium ≥ LLN , high CTCAE grade 1 case elevate value Note : Potassium , calcium , magnesium , and/or phosphorus supplement may give correct value &lt; LLN : AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN ( ≤ 3.0 x ULN patient Gilbert syndrome ) Serum creatinine level ≤ 2.5 x ULN , calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 40 ml/min 10 . Patient provide write informed consent prior screen procedure 11 . Patient able swallow capsule 12 . Patient must able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement 13 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start study treatment 1 . Primary refractory disease ( patient never reach least MR 60 day prior therapy ) 2 . Patients history prior MM treatment DAC inhibitor include panobinostat 3 . Patients prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation show evidence active graftversushost disease require immunosuppressive therapy 4 . Peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2 5 . Patients need valproic acid medical condition study within 5 day prior first administration study drug / treatment switch safely alternative antiepileptic medication 6 . Patients impaired cardiac function include follow : Congenital long QT syndrome , complete leave bundle branch block use permanent cardiac pacemaker , history presence ventricular tachyarrhythmias , clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) . Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( bifascicular block ) QTcF &gt; 450 msec screen ECG Presence unstable atrial fibrillation . Patients stable atrial fibrillation allow study provide meet cardiac prohibit drug exclusion criterion Previous history angina pectoris acute MI within 6 month Congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) Patient clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g . uncontrolled hypertension ) 7 . Patient impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption panobinostat ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , malabsorption syndrome , obstruction , significant small bowel resection ) 8 . Patient unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 9 . Patients concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition ( ) include , limited : uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , active uncontrolled infection , chronic obstructive chronic restrictive pulmonary disease ( e.g . dyspnea rest cause ) , symptomatic thyroid dysfunction , significant bleeding tendency , could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol 10 . Patients use medication know relative risk prolong QT interval induce Torsade de Pointes , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug 11 .
