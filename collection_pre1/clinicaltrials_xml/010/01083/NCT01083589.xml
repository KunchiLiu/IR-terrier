	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Docetaxel Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imatinib mesylate medication block certain protein important development cancer . Docetaxel drug design target destroy cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , take 4 imatinib mesylate tablet mouth day . Docetaxel give vein arm first day treatment cycle total 6 cycle . The infusion take 1 hour . A treatment cycle study 21 day . You need take steroid ( dexamethasone ) receiving docetaxel try prevent fluid accumulation hypersensitivity reaction . The dexamethasone come pill form take every 12 hour 3 day start day chemotherapy . You also receive additional dexamethasone vein docetaxel give . After complete 6 treatment cycle , continue take 4 imatinib mesylate tablet day cancer get bad , experience unacceptable side effect , withdraw study . While study , physical exam every 3 week . During first 5 week study , blood test week . About 3 teaspoon blood drawn time . After first 5 week , blood test ( 3 teaspoon ) begin treatment cycle . In addition , tumor measure CT MRI scan every 6 week . You must agree use herbal remedy over-the-counter therapy ( e.g. , shark cartilage ) treatment . If develop unacceptable symptom change laboratory test , treatment may delay and/or dose decrease symptom go . It may even necessary stop treatment . Your doctor inform change dose schedule dos medication he/she evaluate clinic . After treatment end , follow-up visit clinic . At visit , complete physical exam , include blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine test . You also CT scan measure size tumor body . This investigational study . Imatinib mesylate FDA approve treatment leukemia . Docetaxel FDA approve treatment breast , prostate , NSCLC . Up 50 patient take part study . All enrol UTMDACC .</detailed_description>
