	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving temsirolimus together bevacizumab may better way block tumor growth . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose temsirolimus give together bevacizumab see well work treat patient hormone-resistant metastatic prostate cancer respond chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Bevacizumab Hormone-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective Phase I portion study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) temsirolimus combination AVASTIN subject chemotherapy refractory metastatic CRPC . II . The primary objective Phase II portion study evaluate objective response frequency ( PSA RECIST-Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors-defined ) combination temsirolimus AVASTIN patient chemotherapy refractory metastatic CRPC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect combination temsirolimus AVASTIN time clinical progression overall survival patient chemotherapy refractory metastatic CRPC . II . To evaluate safety temsirolimus give combination AVASTIN chemotherapy refractory metastatic CRPC patient dose establish phase I safety phase . III . To determine presence circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) status single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) CRPC patient . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30-60 minute weekly bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every two week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
