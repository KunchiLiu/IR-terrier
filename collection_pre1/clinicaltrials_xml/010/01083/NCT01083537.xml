	<brief_summary>The best way treat MBO patient ovarian cancer study enough trial assess one treatment arm ( surgical , chemotherapeutic , supportive care approach ) affect clinical outcome like resolution bowel obstruction , survival , quality life . To improve patient outcome , must assess patient well palliative surgery , chemotherapy , best supportive care . This study gather safety information , reasonable give chemotherapy BSC patient advance ovarian cancer MBO non-surgical candidate . This study also look effect chemotherapy BSC quality life resolution bowel obstruction , hop perform future study lead best management MBO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Best Supportive Care Either Cisplatin Paclitaxel Treat Patients With Primary Ovarian Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer Fallopian Tube Cancer Inoperable Malignant Bowel Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal management MBO patient ovarian cancer define proper prospective randomize control trial evaluate impact define multidisciplinary treatment arm ( surgical , chemotherapeutic , supportive care approach ) important clinical outcome include resolution bowel obstruction , survival endpoint validate quality life outcome . In order improve patient outcome , must define patient benefit palliative surgery , patient appropriate candidate chemotherapy patient benefit best supportive care . This study determine safety , feasibility chemotherapy BSC patient advance ovarian cancer present MBO initially deem non-surgical candidate identify impact chemotherapy BSC quality life resolution bowel obstruction , preparation future prospective randomize study determine optimal management MBO .</detailed_description>
