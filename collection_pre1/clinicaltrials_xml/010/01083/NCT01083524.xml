	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The small molecule metabolic modulator Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) safe , tolerate potential therapy patient moderate severe Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) . This Phase I , two centre study subject PAH WHO functional class III-IV whose symptom clinically stable prescribed medical treatment ( include endothelin and/or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ) 8 week prior enrollment . Such patient give either DCA 3.0 mg/kg BID ( group I ) , 6.25 mg/kg BID ( group II ) 12.5 mg/kg BID ( group III ) additional treatment 16 week . The design open-label subject act control . Primary endpoint safety tolerability DCA . Secondary end point include : ) functional capacity include change 6 minute walk form baseline , b ) change pulmonary vascular resistance ( measure right heart catheterization ) , c ) right ventricular volume mass ( measure MRI ) , ) NT-proBNP level change baseline , e ) change FDG-glucose uptake lung right ventricle ( measure PET ) f ) change quality life index . 15 evaluable patient site expect include .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vascular remodel PAH state apoptosis-resistance . As cancer , switch anti-apoptotic glycolytic metabolism towards pro-apoptotic oxidative phosphorylation metabolism , show cause regression vascular remodel PAH several animal model . This achieve small molecular DCA , inhibitor mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase . DCA use human 30 year , mostly treatment inherited mitochondrial disorder also currently evaluate potential therapy cancer . This first-in-humans , Phase I , two centre study ( University Alberta Imperial College ) subject advanced PAH , whose symptom clinically stable prescribed medical treatment 8 week prior enrollment . These treatment include standard ( eg diuretic , warfarin ) specific PAH therapy ( eg endothelin phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ) . From know metabolism drug involve , pharmacokinetic interaction anticipate . In line safety efficacy study , design open-label subject act control . Patients PAH stable current therapy precede 2 month give either DCA 3.0 mg/kg BID ( group I ) , 6.25 mg/kg BID ( group II ) 12.5 mg/kg BID ( group III ) additional treatment 16 week . Following baseline visit , patient follow every week first month , week 6 , 8 10 , 12 16 . In week 1 , 3 , 6 10 , patient ' status assess telephone interview . At visit : medical history physical examination perform . With exception week 2 ( unless clinically indicate ) , combine routine hematology biochemistry assessment functional capacity ( 6 minute walk test ) . Serum lactate NT-pro-BNP level measure PDH activity assay perform . Urine obtain DCA metabolite study . At baseline 16 week : A cardiac catheterization ass change pulmonary hemodynamics ; routine cardiac MR ( RV mass/volumes , MR angiography ) ; FDG-PET examine effect regional lung RV glucose uptake . If tolerate well , subject continue medication return follow-up assessment Weeks 20 , 24 28 . At follow-up visit , physical examination perform functional capacity assess ( 6 minute walk test ) . At Week 28 visit routine cardiac MR also perform . Enrollment continue 30 evaluable subject ( 15 site ) include .</detailed_description>
