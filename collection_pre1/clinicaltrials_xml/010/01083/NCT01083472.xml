	<brief_summary>The objective study compare incidence post-repair wound related complication , include hernia occurrence/recurrence , challenge abdominal wall defect repair Strattice ( TM ) Reconstructive Tissue Matrix ( TM ) manage standard repair . It hypothesize use Strattice ( TM ) TM reinforce repair reduce incidence post-repair complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repair Challenging Abdominal Wall Defects : Strattice ( TM ) TM Abdominal Wall Repair ( StAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , single-blind , randomize , longitudinal , cross-over evaluation repair challenge abdominal wall defect use Strattice ( TM ) TM standard surgical repair . These abdominal wall defect acute chronic , include midline , transverse ( include flank ) well Pfannenstiel incision . The skin may close ( fascial dehiscence incisional hernia ) open ( patient open abdomen acute fascial dehiscence ) without evisceration . Patients randomize control group require re-operation perform plan final repair due failure initial repair within 12 month , offer repair Stratticeâ„¢ TM ( i.e . `` crossed '' ) repair perform , patient complete study . An adaptive study design use validate initial conditional power study balance randomization , base upon three condition ( type defect [ dehiscence , hernia repair open abdomen ] , morbidity [ POSSUM score ] time since exposure abdominal fascia/viscera ) use equally distribute subject group . The primary endpoint study hernia occurrence 12 month post repair secondary endpoint include re-operation abdominal wall repair within 12 month , incidence complication require intervention ( medical surgical ) within first 30 day repair , , length hospitalization resource utilization , cause mortality . Subjects enrol randomized receive Strattice ( TM ) TM reinforcement repair standard care repair ( i.e . suture alone suture absorbable mesh ) follow set timepoints observe incision site repair surgical site event , include reoperation hernia occurrence .</detailed_description>
