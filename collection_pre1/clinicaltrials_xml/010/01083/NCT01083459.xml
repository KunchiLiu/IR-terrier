	<detailed_description>Pneumococcus bacterium healthy people commonly nose throat ; call pneumococcal 'carriage ' . Carriage usually harmless , progress serious disease like pneumonia , meningitis , blood stream infection less serious , burdensome , disease like sinusitis ear infection . Infants elderly bear great burden pneumococcal disease 800,000 annual global death germ among child 5 year age . Furthermore , pneumococcus develop resistance antibiotic make increasingly difficult treat pneumococcal infection . Within United States Native American group , like Navajo White Mountain Apache tribe , suffer pneumococcal disease much often people general US population . We n't know pneumococcus disproportionately afflict community , know health disparity significantly reduce vaccination . In 2000 , first time pneumococcal vaccine design specifically infant , call PCV7 , become available put routine use among Navajo Apache well general US population . PCV7 contain 7 common &gt; 90 pneumococcal strain exist . Although PCV7 give infant toddler , impact pneumococcal disease throughout community protects vaccinate infant disease also protect NP colonization . Infants child main transmitter pneumococcal colonization community change carriage affect whole population pneumococcal germ circulate within family community . Reductions pneumococcal disease cause 7 type PCV7 exceed expectation , especially among Navajo Apache see virtually case 5 year . But , PCV7 unintended consequence increase amount pneumococcal disease pneumococcal type PCV7 . Therefore new vaccine protect 13 pneumococcal strain , call PCV13 , develop license use ( expected licensure Q4/2009 ) . This project aim reveal impact PCV13 pneumococcal disease carriage strain move person person within Navajo community . We specifically intend find use PCV13 effect disease carriage 6 additional strain vaccine find PCV13 result emergence new pneumococcal serotypes within community , like PCV7 . This information allow u design vaccine strategy meet new pattern pneumococcal disease stay least one step ahead organism change . It also provide evidence rational policy PCV13 use among Navajo make . This essential information past experience vaccine shortage , Navajo communities give priority vaccine use . We also propose explore correlation pneumococcal colonization viral infection nasopharynx establish enhanced risk pneumococcal colonization set viral co-infection enhances risk develop disease . To achieve overall objective propose pull together three type information ( 1 ) effect PCV13 nasopharyngeal colonization pneumococcus viral pathogen ( 2 ) effect PCV13 disease ( 3 ) use PCV13 community .</detailed_description>
