	<brief_title>Decision Making Radioactive Iodine Treatment Papillary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Primary research question In patient early stage papillary thyroid cancer , administration computerize decision aid improve score test knowledge early stage PTC adjuvant RAI treatment , compare usual care ? ( The knowledge score sum positive response total 10 true/false question self-administered questionnaire , administer study visit , Q2A ) . B . Secondary research question 1 . In patient early stage PTC , administration computerize decision aid reduce overall decisional conflict ( well follow respective subscales - inform subscale , uncertainty subscale , effective decision subscale ) , compare usual care ? ( Decisional Conflict questionnaire , DCS ) . 2 . In patient early stage PTC , administration computerize decision aid , improve reduce decisional regret relate RAI decision make final decision make ? ( Decision Regret Questionnaire , DRQ ) 3 . In patient early stage PTC , administration computerize decision aid , reduce number participant receive adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment ( analysis participant , well already wait list radioactive iodine treatment time recruitment , respectively ) ? 4 . Do respective monitoring blunting score Miller Behavioral Style Scale ( MBSS ) correlate number click information perform participant review decision aid ? ( subgroup analysis decision aid intervention group ) 5 . Do respective monitoring blunting score Miller Behavioral Style Scale ( MBSS ) correlate score test knowledge early stage PTC adjuvant RAI treatment ? ( Respective analysis plan entire study population , well intervention control group ) 6 . What main reason RAI treatment select select ( decision finalize ) , group description accord exposure non-exposure computerized decision aid ? ( See Follow-up questionnaire [ administer telephone ] , question 2 , qualitative description , reason cod quantified use mixed method ) . NOTE : In original design study , hop utilize modified Client Satisfaction Questionnaire assessment satisfaction patient participant physicians secondary trial outcome . However , unable utilize modify Client Satisfaction Questionnaires study , lack permission original developer Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 , copyright trademarked questionnaire prohibits modification . No modified client satisfaction questionnaire result analyze study analyze . Study design The project design single-centre randomized control trial conduct University Health Network . The participant randomize ) decision aid group ( addition usual care [ counseling physician , call usual care ] ) b ) usual care . The DA available participant study ( public treat physician ) . The decision aid test perform Toronto General Hospital . 15-23 Month Extended Follow-up Study : After initiation primary study , subsequently award funding contact enrol study participant 15 23 month post-randomization inquire permission participate extend follow-up study . The extended follow-up study approve University Health Network Research Ethics Board . Participants original randomize control trial ( ) contact telephone consent participate extend follow-up study , consider exploratory ( secondary ) . The extended follow-up study include quantitative questionnaire telephone interview component qualitative component . For quantitative questionnaire component , single telephone interview perform updating demographic , thyroid cancer outcomes/treatments ( confirmatory medical record review administer quantitative questionnaire verbally . A participant consent extend follow-up study also offer opportunity participate in-depth qualitative study , involve one-on in-person interview ( audio-recorded , transcribed , analyzed use qualitative method ) . A representative subgroup 15-30 participant invite qualitative interview sample continued saturation theme achieve . The following exploratory question address quantitative component extend follow-up study ( 15-23 month post-randomization ) : 1 . To degree participant study ( decision aid control group ) perceive respectively inform satisfied original radioactive iodine treatment decision ? The result respective study arm compare . 2 . To degree participant study ( decision aid control group ) perceive regret original radioactive iodine treatment decision ? The result respective study arm compare . 3 . To degree participant study ( decision aid control group ) perceive current cancer-related worry ( Assessment Survivor Concerns Questionnaires ) ? The result respective study arm compare . 4 . To degree participant study ( decision aid control group ) perceive trust treating physician ( Trust Physician Scale ) ? The result respective study arm compare . 5 . How participant study ( decision aid control group ) perceive mood ( PHQ-4 questionnaire ) ? The result respective study arm compare . The qualitative subgroup study include semi-structured question experience radioactive iodine treatment decision-making , overall thyroid cancer treatment satisfaction , study participation . Exploratory Telephone Survey Study - 24 month long randomization : After initiation primary study , subsequently award pilot study funding contact study participant one occasion , two year post-randomization inquire permission participate exploratory telephone survey study , intend guide future research direction , generate data possible use sample size calculation potential future study . The 24 month long post-randomization exploratory telephone survey study approve University Health Network Research Ethics Board . Participants original randomize control trial ( ) contact telephone consent participate study , consider exploratory ( secondary ) thus , hypothesis-generating . The telephone survey exploratory study ( 2 year post-randomization ) consist quantitative telephone questionnaire . A single telephone interview perform updating demographic , thyroid cancer outcomes/treatments ( confirmatory medical record review administer quantitative questionnaire verbally . The following exploratory question address exploratory 24 month ( long ) post-randomization study . For analysis , descriptive data describe entire study population , sample size permit , subgroup analysis accord decision aid status , radioactive iodine status , age ( &lt; 45 year time original surgery 45 year old time original surgery ) , recurrence status , consider . 1 . To describe Cancer Impact consent participant , 2 year post-randomization . For participant negative financial impact cancer report , additional question pose request explanation impact . 2 . To describe Information Needs consenting participant , 2 year post-randomization . 3 . To describe General Concerns consent participant , 2 year post-randomization . 4 . To describe cancer-related worry ( Assessment Survivor Concerns Questionnaires ) two year follow randomization .</detailed_description>
