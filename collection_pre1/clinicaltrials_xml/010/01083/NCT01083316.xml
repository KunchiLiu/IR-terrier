	<brief_summary>The drug dexamethasone bortezomib FDA-approved treatment multiple myeloma , disease similar amyloidosis . However , currently investigational treatment amyloidosis . We want find addition dexamethasone bortezomib standard high dose chemotherapy stem cell transplant help improve response . Standard treatment include four step : 1 ) Stem Cell Mobilization ( standard ) 2 ) Stem Cell Collection ( standard ) 3 ) Conditioning Regimen ( Melphalan chemotherapy ) . The condition regimen help kill abnormal cell body make room bone marrow new blood stem cell grow . 4 ) Stem Cell Infusion Participants study additional treatment step call `` induction therapy '' , design first step towards reduce number abnormal cell body . Two cycle investigational drug bortezomib dexamethasone give induction therapy . In addition , bortezomib give part condition regimen , addition standard melphalan chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
