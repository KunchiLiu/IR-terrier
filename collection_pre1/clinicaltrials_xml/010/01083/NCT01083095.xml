	<brief_summary>A clinical trial aim standardize vivax sporozoite infection model human volunteer conduct Malaria Vaccine Drug Development Center ( MVDC ) collaboration Immunology Institute Valle State University Fundación Clínica Valle del Lili ( FCVL ) Cali , Colombia . The primary objective determine naïve human volunteer could safely reproducibly infect bite An . albimanus mosquito carry P. vivax sporozoites salivary gland secondary objective consist determine minimal number infect mosquito require infect volunteer , reproducible pre-patent period . The trial divide two step : Step A directed obtain human blood infect P.vivax parasite use infect anopheles mosquito Step B produce P. vivax sporozoites Anopheles mosquito determine dose response naive human volunteer expose 3 +/- 1 , 6 +/- 1 9 +/- 1 mosquito bite . A total 15 sample P. vivax infect donor use infect different batch mosquito .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : The study randomize open label clinical trial establish sporozoite challenge model Plasmodium vivax human . The development standardization model make possible evaluate efficacy candidate P. vivax vaccine Phase 2a trial . The study divide two successive step : Step A Parasite Blood Donation : Volunteers recruit passively group patient present active P. vivax infection accept donate infect blood . Samples P. vivax infect blood collect screen infectious disease , accord standard blood bank procedure . Colonized Anopheles albimanus mosquito feed blood use Membrane Feeding Assay ( MFA ) . Sixteen ( 16 ) day , select positive mosquito batch use step B . Step B Challenge : After inform consent signature , total 18 healthy volunteer randomly allocate Groups 1 , 2 3 , 6 volunteer challenge bite 3±1 , 6±1 9±1 P. vivax infect mosquito . Volunteers closely monitor post infection , treat soon blood infection become patent ascertain microscopic examination thick blood smear ( TBS ) . Comparison three bite pattern use select optimal number P. vivax-infected mosquito bite need provide reliable reproducible blood infection . Infection expect occur first 30 day . After time , infection document , antimalarial treatment plan . Nevertheless expose volunteer present malarial infection . Despite infection expect day 30 , 18 month follow-up perform sure delay malaria infection present without detection . So , total duration study 18 month . Infection determine detection P. vivax parasites TBS volunteer include . Eligibility criterion Blood donor Step A : - Adult , male female ( 18-60 year age ) . - Capacity freely understand sign inform consent form participation . - TBS Positive P.vivax negative malaria specie . - P.vivax gametocytemia &gt; 0.2 % . Exclusion criterion - Unable provide free willing write informed consent . - Have illness condition , investigator 's judgment , may substantially increase risk associate blood donation . Eligibility exclusion criterion Challenge describe format . Close monitoring adverse event perform , medical examination telephone contact .</detailed_description>
