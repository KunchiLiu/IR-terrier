	<brief_title>Acetaminophen Impaired Musculoskeletal Adaptations Exercise Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The commonly use pain reliever acetaminophen ibuprofen may impair musculoskeletal adaptation progressive resistance exercise train inhibit exercise-induced muscle protein synthesis . To test hypothesis acetaminophen ibuprofen would diminish training-induced increase fat-free mass , untrained men ( n=26 ) age â‰¥ 50 year participate 16 week high-intensity progressive resistance exercise train bone-loading exercise randomly assign take ACET ( 1000 mg ) , ibuprofen ( 400 mg ) placebo 2 hour exercise session . The primary outcome change total body fat-free mass measure dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) baseline week 16 . Our primary interest comparison acetaminophen placebo group .</detailed_description>
