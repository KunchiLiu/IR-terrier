	<brief_summary>Healthy biological system characterize normal range `` variability '' organ function . For example , many study heart rate clearly document loss normal level intrinsic , beat-to-beat variability heart rate associate poor prognosis early death . Unlike heart , little know pattern respiratory variability illness . What know , like heart , healthy subject specific range variability breath- to-breath depth timing . Additionally , animal model , ventilator strategy re-introduce normal variability breathe pattern significantly reduce ventilator-associated lung injury . Critically ill patient require mechanical ventilation offer opportunity observe analyze respiratory pattern completely non-invasive manner . Current mechanical ventilator produce real-time output respiratory tracing analyze variability . The investigator propose non-invasively record tracing patient ventilate intensive care unit mathematical variability analysis . The purpose pilot analysis : ( 1 ) demonstrate range respiratory variability present mechanically ventilate critically ill ( 2 ) demonstrate ventilator modality deliver permit close approximation previously describe beneficial normal level variability . Future study use pilot data order determine observe pattern respiratory variability mechanically ventilate critically ill subject prognostic therapeutic implication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Different mode mechanical ventilation allow different level patient control respiratory pattern . For example , common mode ventilation , call volume control , give little control patient amount air take breath . Other mode , pressure control , pressure regulate volume control pressure support , allow patient control volume air deliver ventilator . Newer mode , airway pressure release ventilation ( APRV ) , allow completely spontaneous patient respiration . All mode allow least patient control respiratory rate . Studies natural breathe healthy subject show normal level variability respiratory rate tidal volume.1 Variability physiological process associate health loss variability presage onset illness . For example , normal human expose LPS ( lipopolysaccharide-the potent immune-stimulating cell wall component bacteria ) lose normal respiratory variability . Thus , physiological variability may represent `` hidden vital sign , '' monitoring may herald important clinical event . Additionally , re-establishing normal level variability therapeutic benefit animal model . 2 The variability respiratory pattern ill patient well study . For example , currently unclear critical illness result deviation normal variability pattern , ventilator mode allow increase patient control respiration allow patient attain great normalcy respiratory variability , deviation normal respiratory pattern ventilator mode allow increase level spontaneous breathe prognostic implication . The purpose pilot study record respiratory pattern ventilator patient receive various mode mechanical ventilation order quantify compare level respiratory variability associate mode . Our hypothesis APRV , mode allow spontaneous respiration , associate respiratory variability pattern closely approximate normal subject . We hope data derive study inform future observational study correlate respiratory variability mechanical ventilation severity illness prognosis .</detailed_description>
