	<brief_title>Intensive Computerized Brain Training ( ICBT ) Youth With Early Onset Psychosis ( EOP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study provide foundation future rigorous study intervention translates know refinement synaptic connection response environmental stimulus individualize intervention directly improve neurocognitive function youth early onset psychosis ( EOP ) . We conduct pilot randomize control study determine feasibility , tolerability acceptability Intensive Computerized Brain Training ( ICBT ) youth EOP . Participants : Seventy youth , age 10 year 19 year inclusive assess study . Forty youths EOP randomly assign ICBT equally intense computerized game activity 20 age , gender race match youth major psychiatric illness . We allow 5 EOP screen failures 5 healthy control screen failure . Procedures ( method ) : The forty participant EOP randomly assign treatment ICBT equally intense video game play also involve attention sensory stimuli require increasingly skilled response . A computer generate randomization schedule use make assignment . Outcomes assessed baseline , completion intervention ( typically week 20 ) , 3 complete intervention ( typically month 8 ) 7 month complete intervention ( typically month 12 ) . The 20 youth , comprise typically develop comparison group know healthy control , participate computer activity regular monthly psychiatric visit complete satisfaction questionnaire . Up 10 subject may eligible participate study .</detailed_description>
