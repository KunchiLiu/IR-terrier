	<detailed_description>Despite advance medical technology , heart failure remain major cause illness global scale . The quest understanding condition develop new treatment strategy lead consideration stem cell possible therapy . Medical research , recent year , show adult stem cell ( oppose embryonic stem cell ) present organ adult human . Their exact function however poorly understood . An improved understanding stem cell work essential effective stem cell treatment develop future . A number stem cell research group around world find adult stem cell circulate blood human . These circulate cell likely enter bloodstream bone marrow think travel blood get body organ may help repair damaged tissue . Interestingly , level circulate stem cell find different healthy people compare various disease , include heart attack heart failure . This lead researcher think stem cell may play important role human body fight diseases . To date , level one type stem cell measure patient heart failure . Also , one study stem cell level patient heart failure time sudden worsen condition later patient follow recovery . This information would valuable expand scientific knowledge stem cell behave different stage heart disease . The project seek examine level number different type stem cell patient heart failure , compare healthy volunteer . The project also aim measure stem cell level patient heart failure time sudden worsen condition later patient follow recovery . The project entail take blood sample order measure stem cell level blood . The study NOT involve form treatment stem cell . Two group patient study ; patient heart failure healthy volunteer . Following obtainment inform consent , screen history , physical examination routine blood test perform . After , 50ml sample blood take study participant . This equivalent 10 teaspoonfuls blood . The 50ml blood sample obtain take immediately laboratory analysis . In case patient heart failure , order measure stem cell blood level recovery , one additional blood sample obtain ; 50ml blood sample patient send home hospital . Patients heart failure identify health care staff Alfred Hospital . Healthy volunteer identify use database healthy volunteer express interest participate clinical study . Potential study participant initially approach provide write information . If potential participant wish proceed study , involve one outpatient hospital visit healthy volunteer . For patient heart failure , study involve two visit study staff hospital admission .</detailed_description>
