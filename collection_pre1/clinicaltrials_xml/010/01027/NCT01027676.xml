	<brief_summary>Gefitinib orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) produce 8-20 % response rate patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Vorinostat ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [ SAHA ] ) small-molecule inhibitor histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) induce cell differentiation , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis several tumor cell . There strong synergistic antiproliferative effect vorinostat combination gefitinib NSCLC cell . Vorinostat increase expression E-cadherin ErbB-3 , result increase sensitivity gefitinib . Moreover , In-vitro study show vorinostat lead acetylation disruption Hsp90 , may lead decrease activity pro-growth prosurvival client protein ( J Bio Chem 2005 ; 280:26729 , Br J Cancer 2006 ; 95 : S2 ) . These finding suggest combination vorinostat gefitinib may improve efficacy gefitinib NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Vorinostat Gefitinib Relapsed/ Refractory Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Carcinoma ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I design - Three patient treat per cohort one cycle ( 28 day per cycle ) . - If DLTs record , treatment continue three patient treat subsequent cohort . - However , patient develops DLT , another three patient treat cohort one cycle . - If DLTs , dose escalation continue . - If one three patient develop DLT cohort , another three patient treat next low dosage cohort . - If DLTs record cohort , cohort 3 expand six patient . - Up 12 patient enrol MTD . - The phase II dose combine treatment therefore define high dosage cohort six patient treat less three DLTs .</detailed_description>
