	<brief_summary>The propose study : 1. estimate prevalence need cancer screen prevention population 211 caller ; 2. determine whether cancer communication intervention deliver 211 increase use breast , cervical colon cancer screening , HPV vaccination , smoke cessation adoption smoke free home policy ; 3. determine intensive intervention need bring change ; 4. determine whether effectiveness intervention enhance caller ' basic need address . Connecting system - 211 , clinical community cancer control program navigation service - benefit disadvantaged Americans . The propose study evaluate effect approach eliminate cancer disparity . We hypothesize proportion 211 caller obtain needed cancer control service : 1. differ significantly study group follow : N &gt; T &gt; P &gt; CONTROL ; 2. vary significantly across study group base intervention dose caller receive ; 3. vary significantly across study group base whether caller ' original need resolve , extent basic need , perception life manageable predictable ( i.e. , sense coherence ) . ( Dissemination Aim ) : Determine cost 211 effect quality service offer cancer control referral .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For Americans live poverty , cancer prevention screen low priority meeting basic need . When basic need address , likelihood engage preventive behavior increase . Strategies eliminate cancer disparity disadvantage population must recognize address fundamental challenge . We propose first-ever cancer communication research partnership United Way 2-1-1 , telephone information referral system reach million low-income minority Americans every year connect locally available resource meet basic need . By proactively link caller evidence-based cancer control service available free community , cancer disparity could reduce . The propose study : 1. estimate prevalence need cancer screen prevention population 211 caller ; 2. determine whether cancer communication intervention deliver 211 increase use breast , cervical colon cancer screening , HPV vaccination , smoke cessation adoption smoke free home policy ; 3. determine intensive intervention need bring change ; 4. determine whether effectiveness intervention enhance caller ' basic need address . Connecting system - 211 , clinical community cancer control program navigation service - benefit disadvantaged Americans . The propose study evaluate effect approach eliminate cancer disparity . Objectives : Study group assignment -- By random assignment receive either : - Tailored Cancer Communication help act cancer control referral receive ; - A Cancer Control Navigator help overcome obstacle obtain needed cancer control service ; - Cancer Control Phone Referral Only ; , - No intervention control The study aim : 1 . Estimate prevalence need cancer screen prevention population 211 caller compare rate population data Missouri U.S. 2 . Evaluate effect Tailored Cancer Communication ( T ) , Cancer Control Navigation ( N ) , Cancer Control Phone Referral Only ( P ) use cancer control service randomize trial among 211 caller .</detailed_description>
