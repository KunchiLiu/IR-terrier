	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety maximum tolerate dose PCI-24781 give safely doxorubicin ( phase I ) safety efficacy PCI-24781 use combination doxorubicin ( phase II ) patient advanced sarcoma . The study drug , PCI-24781 , believe regulate gene involve tumor cell growth . The study drug , doxorubicin , consider standard chemotherapeutic treatment advance sarcoma patient . We hypothesize combine PCI-24781 doxorubicin overcome chemoresistance doxorubicin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PCI-24781 Combination With Doxorubicin Treat Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In phase I portion study , since look high dose PCI-24781 administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant advance sarcoma , everyone participates research study receive dose PCI-24871 . - Each treatment cycle 3 week ( 21 day ) . Participants take capsule PCI-24871 five consecutive day start Day 1 3 week cycle . On Day 4 cycle , participant come clinic receive doxorubicin intravenously . - At specific time interval , participant return clinic follow test procedure : physical examination , vital sign , blood test , urine test , EKG , assessment tumor CT scan , ECHO MUGA . - Participants may remain study maximum 6 cycle ( 4-5 month ) . After last cycle , long participant showing benefit , may elect continue take PCI-24781 alone , case continue research study evidence tumor grow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm metastatic unresectable sarcoma All participant must receive lifetime cumulative maximum dose 300 mg/m2 less prior doxorubicin anthracycline therapy . Participants must measurable disease , define least one unirradiated lesion accurately measure least one dimension 20mm great conventional technique 10mm great spiral CT scan . ECOG performance status 2 less Ability swallow oral capsule without difficulty Participants must normal organ marrow function outline protocol . Women childbearing potential must negative serum/urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior receive first dose PCI24781 . An ECHO MUGA demonstrate EF &gt; 50 % require within 4 week prior study drug administration . 18 year age old Participants immunotherapy , chemotherapy , experimental therapy radiotherapy within 4 week first day study drug dose recover grade 1 baseline adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants previously receive &gt; 300 mg/m2 cumulative lifetime dose doxorubicin , receive anthracycline chemotherapy . Major surgery within 4 week first day study drug dose Participants know central nervous system/brain metastasis Participants receive chronic corticosteroid &gt; 20 mg prednisone equivalent per day &gt; 7 consecutive day ( Topical , inhale nasal corticosteroid permit ) . Participants document malabsorption syndrome condition may impair absorption PCI24781 capsule . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Participants require concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation receive therapeutic anticoagulation within 2 week first day dose . Risk factor Torsades de Pointes , use , within 4 week start study drug administration , medication know prolong QTc interval may associate Torsades de Pointes . QTc prolongation significant ECG abnormality define 2nd degree AV block type II , 3rd degree AV block , bradycardia . History myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , coronary angioplasty and/or coronary artery stenting within past 6 month . For patient history major coronary artery disease judgement responsible physician , cardiac stress test demonstrate clinically significant abnormality perform within 28 day first dose study drug Pregnant breastfeed woman Women childbearing potential , sexually active men unwilling use adequate contraceptive protection course study HIVpositive individual Other medical psychiatric illness organ dysfunction , opinion investigator , would either compromise patient 's safety interfere evaluation safety PCI24781</criteria>
