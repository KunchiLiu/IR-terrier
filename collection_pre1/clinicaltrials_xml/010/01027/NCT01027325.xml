	<brief_summary>The alarm increase prevalence obesity cause great concern give association many adverse health condition , include insulin resistance type 2 diabetes , associate increase cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk . The primary objective project identify effective dietary strategy , focus carbohydrate quantity starch digestibility , improve outcome variable associate CVD risk insulin resistant individual express component atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype ( ALP ) . Current dietary guideline emphasize substitution carbohydrate calorie total saturated fat calorie prevention management chronic disease . Yet , others show high-carbohydrate diet increase expression ALP , characterize increase plasma triglyceride , reduce HDL cholesterol , increased level small , dense LDL particle , phenotype reverse moderate carbohydrate restriction . We also show expression stearoyl coenzymeA desaturase ( SCD ) , enzyme involved triglyceride synthesis , reduce carbohydrate restriction change correlate plasma triglyceride response . While carbohydrate restriction effective management ALP , role starch quality address . Furthermore , study effect resistant vs. digestible starch incorporate high- vs. low carbohydrate diet . Since isolated report suggest increase intake resistant starch lower plasma triglyceride postprandial insulinemia , hypothesize starch quality important determinant component ALP , may mediate part reduce adipose tissue SCD expression . Aim 1 proposal address hypothesis control dietary intervention 52 insulin resistant men woman change plasma lipid , lipoproteins lipogenic gene expression determine substitute resistant starch digestible starch high- vs. lower-carbohydrate diet . In Aim 2 , fast postprandial glucose insulin response resistant vs. digestible starch meal measure test hypothesis starch digestibility improve glycemic insulinemic control way relate diet-induced change plasma lipid lipoprotein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinic Visits : Participants visit clinic total 11 time screen completion study . This include weekly visit dietician 7 visit require blood draw ( screen twice follow diet period ) . At visit , participant weigh , waist hip circumference measure , blood pressure monitor . The total amount blood collect 450ml . Screening visit ( V1 : 1 hour ) : Recruiters initially determine eligibility review screen questionnaire telephone personal interview . If potential subject eligible interested , orientation package mail include write information study requirement . Interested subject schedule screen visit determine final eligibility Clinical staff . At screen visit ( V1 ) , informed consent obtain , anthropometric measurement obtain ( height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure ) , blood ( 30ml ) drawn assess laboratory criterion enrollment ( total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose , insulin determination HOMA-IR ) . Screening blood sample individual either eligible unwilling proceed intervention destroy . We screen pregnancy , repeat pregnancy test `` A '' visit ( V2a , v3a , v4a ) . Menstruating woman give calendar record menstrual cycle duration study . Eligible individual contact within 2 week screen visit invite participate study . We prepare enroll 64 participant study yield target 52 complete participant ( 20 % dropout ) . Dietitian Visits ( Initial : 1 hr , Subsequent : 15 min ) : Participants meet weekly dietitian dietitian aide receive counsel include weight management diet review . At meeting , participant receive week 's worth frozen entree , standardize menu check list , itemized grocery list . Baked good product contain test starch also provide time . The form provide ( frozen fresh ) depend nature product capacity withstand refrigerate vs. frozen storage . During washout period ( day 28-42 ) , subject continue refrain alcohol consume usual home diet 7 day , follow baseline diet additional 7 day . We anticipate give participant permission eat want 7 day washout improve compliance remainder dietary protocol . Participants bring grocery store receipt previous week dietitian may ensure purchase prescribe food provide Bionutrition Unit . Post-diet Visits Requiring Blood Draws ( A visit : 2.5 hr , B visit : 5 hr ) : Participants visit clinic two separate day follow completion diet provide blood sample . Duplicate sample reduces biological variability , hence improves power study detect significant diet-induced change measurement . On penultimate day diet ( Visits 2A , 3A , 4A ) participant visit clinic fasting state provide fast blood sample ( 30ml ) measurement total , LDL- HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , apolipoproteins A1 B , lipoprotein subfraction analysis ion mobility . Lipoprotein lipase hepatic lipase activity also measure plasma ( 20ml ) obtain 15 minute IV heparin ( 75 units/kg ) . On final day diet ( Visits 2B , 3B , 4B ) , participant provide second fasting blood sample ( lipids lipoprotein ) adipose tissue aspiration measure lipogenic gene expression . In addition 3 hour starch tolerance meal perform visit 3B 4B , blood sample measure glucose insulin drawn fast state 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 minute starch meal ( 60ml total ) . Clinical Procedures : Clinical measurement : Blood pressure measure 3 time sit position last 2 value average . Anthropometric measurement include height , weight , waist hip circumference , % body fat bioimpedance ( Tanita scale ) . Waist circumference measure two time iliac crest hip circumference measure wide point hip . Standard Blood sampling : Using standard blood collection procedure , blood sample collect participant 12-14 hour fast . The blood collect tube contain follow preservative solution : 3.0 gm EDTA ( dipotassium ) , 1.7 mg P-Pack , 0.15 gm gentamycin sulfate , 0.15 gm chloramphenicol , 5.96 ml aprotinin ( Sigma A-6279 ) , 0.30 gm sodium azide dilute 20mls doubly deionized water . Plasma separate immediate centrifugation 4°C . Lipid lipoprotein measurement perform aliquot plasma frozen future analysis . Post-heparin Blood Sampling : A blood sample ( 20ml ) drawn 15 minute intravenous administration heparin bolus ( 75U/kg , see Risk section justification ) analysis plasma lipase activity . Prior administration , participant interview family history clot disorder personal contraindication include use anticoagulant , history bleed bruise abnormality disease , allergy , recent dental work . Following administration , participant remain clinic 2 hour observation . They also provide information sheet regard heparin procedure . Adipose Tissue Biopsy : Adipose biopsy collect subcutaneous flank region R.N . use standardized , sterile procedure . Participants instructed take drug within 2 day procedure would impair clot . This procedure take place least 24 hour post-heparin lipase analysis . Because half-life heparin 2 hour , sufficient time ensure clearance . After clean area participant 's buttock betadine , Lidocaine hydrochloride 1 % ( 10mg/ml ) inject subcutaneous skin . Using number 14G needle , 1-1.5 c.c . 's fat aspirate . Cold pressure hold site wound bandage . Participants instructed change bandage daily two day . They provide two bandage , instruction keep wound clean , telephone number clinical staff reach . Starch Meal Test : Immediately follow adipose tissue biopsy fast blood draw , participant give starch meal provide 1/3 daily calorie consume 15 minute . It similar macronutrient composition test diet participant assign either high amylose amylopectin . Blood drawn 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 minute meal consumption IV . For procedure , intravenous cannula needle place antecubital vein . A normal saline solution run keep open rate antecubital site .</detailed_description>
