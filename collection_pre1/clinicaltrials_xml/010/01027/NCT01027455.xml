	<brief_summary>In laparoscopic ( key-hole ) surgery , use cold dry carbon dioxide gas inflate abdominal cavity creation clear operating field , result damage cavity lining , know peritoneum . This associated negative effect post-operative recovery . Adult study use warm humidify insufflation gas indicate possible decreased post-operative pain , reduce narcotic analgesia requirement , decrease fog laparoscopic camera lens , reduced time return normal activity . Cold dry gas laparoscopic surgery also potential cause abnormal decrease body core temperature ( hypothermia ) . This establish trial adult human animal model . The WARMIST study aim investigate whether warm humid gas insuflation laparoscopic removal appendix child reduce intraoperative temperature variation , post-operative pain ( indicated morphine usage pain score ) , length hospital stay degree camera lens fogging , speed post-operative recovery compare use cold dry gas insufflation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Aim/Question : Does warm humidify carbon dioxide gas compare cold dry gas abdominal cavity insufflation laparoscopic appendectomy child reduce variation intraoperative core body temperature , reduce post-operative pain , improve post-operative recovery ? The Aim study investigate whether difference exist follow outcome : 1 . Intraoperative temperature variation ; 2 . Need post-operative opiate analgesia ( primary outcome study ) ; 3 . Post-operative pain score ; 4 . Length hospital stay ; 5 . Post-operative return normal daily activity ; 6 . Fogging laparoscope lens ; warm humidify rather cold dry gas use intra-abdominal insufflation laparoscopic appendectomy acute appendicitis child . Study Sample Size Power Calculations : From retrospective audit 43 child underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy Starship Children 's Hospital 2006 , 70 % require opiate-based analgesia pain relief stage admission . To detect 30 % reduction 70 % ( i.e . 49 % exposure group require opiate ) power 0.8 alpha 0.05 use 2 tail Fisher 's exact test , 95 participant need per arm trial . Study Participants : - Inclusion criterion : Children age 8-14 year present Starship Children 's Hospital within study period diagnose clinically acute appendicitis require diagnostic laparoscopy +/- appendicectomy . - Exclusion criterion : Consent participate study obtain , partial total blindness , unable speak read sufficient English , presence abdominal prosthesis , diagnosis mental retardation , developmental delay , neuro-muscular impairment , attention-deficit disorder , chronic pain , psychiatric illness , immunosuppression , allergy morphine , history previous abdominal surgery . Study Design : This Randomised-Controlled Trial involve 190 child age 8-14 year present Starship Children 's Hospital clinical sign acute appendicitis . After recruitment , study participant randomise either intervention group ( warm humidify gas insufflation ) control group ( cool dry gas insufflation ) undergo laparoscopic appendicectomy part surgical management acute appendicitis . The insufflation device use Fisher Paykel Insuflow MR 860 . Other intraoperative variable control standardise . A computer-generated random sequence employ randomise study participant . Group allocation place seal opaque envelope open sequence consecutive participant . Allocations conceal completion data collection . To ensure double-blinding ( blind investigator , operate surgeon , member clinical team , study participant family ) , circulate theatre nurse direct involvement care participant unblinded control switch insufflation device . Upon open allocation envelope , set Insuflow device warm humidify cold dry gas insufflation place specially design cover device transfer device operate theatre . This cover place insufflation device duration operation blind theatre personnel . At end operation , insufflation device switch remove theatre circulate theatre nurse cover intact . It disassemble theatre preparation room , sight . The following data measured/collected intraoperatively : 1 . Core body temperature measure every 10 minute nasogastric temperature probe , place anaesthetic induction ; 2 . Severity laparoscopic camera lens fogging : Surgeon 's rating severity camera fogging ( scale 1 10 - 10 represent worst degree fog ) ; 3 . Surgeon 's rating operation 's technical difficulty ( scale 1 10 - 10 represent difficult ) ; 4 . Total volume CO2 gas use pneumoperitoneum creation maintenance ; 5 . Duration operation ; 6 . Total amount analgesia anti-emetics give intraoperatively ; 7 . Pathological appearance appendix degree peritoneal faecal/pus contamination appendix perforation present ; 8 . Temperature volume intravenous fluid administer peritoneal irrigation fluid use . A standard perioperative care protocol use ensure study patient receive standard care , reduce risk performance bias . The protocol cover perioperative use antibiotic , measure prevent infection include wound infection , post-operative oral feeding mobilisation , criterion discharge , etc . Post-operative opioid-sparing analgesia medication ( paracetamol non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent ) standardise study participant post-anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) surgical ward . The route administration depend degree nausea vomiting , oral per rectal preparation available . A Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) 0 10 used measure pain ascertain requirement additional nurse-controlled analgesia . All opiate-based analgesia require first 12 hour post-operatively administer intravenously minimize variation gastrointestinal absorption effect post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . The following outcome measure record post-operatively : 1 . Tympanic body temperature 10-minute interval duration stay PACU 2 . Presence shiver PACU 3 . Post-operative pain score rest movement , measure use 10-point pictorial Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) follow time : 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 48 hour end operation . 4 . Total Nurse-controlled Opioid Analgesia require , oral parenteral , convert Mean Equivalent Daily Dose ( MEDD ) unit parenteral morphine , first 12 , 24 48 hour post-operatively entire hospital stay . The need opioid analgesia total quantity require total duration hospital stay primary outcome study . The opiate-based analgesia available study : oral morphine , IV morphine , IV fentanyl . 5 . Severity post-operative nausea , number vomit episode total amount anti-emetic medication require . 6 . Total length laparoscopic port site wound , measure millimetre first dress change 7 . Length hospital stay ( day ) 8 . Post-operative return normal activity measure use Day-10 Post-operative Recovery Questionnaire give participant family time discharge hospital . Participants ask complete questionnaire morning Day 10 operation post back investigator pre-paid envelope provide . The Questionnaire adapt Pediatric Quality Life Inventory Version 4.0 . The Principle Investigator remind participant phone call one two day Questionnaire complete . All operative disease-related complication ( minor major ) hospital stay report follow-up outpatient clinic also record . Standard internationally-recognized definition operative complication use . Statistical Analysis Data : Intervention Control group compare use Fisher 's exact test categorical variable appropriate non-paired parametric non-parametric statistical test continuous variable , depend normality data . Statistical significance set 2-tailed P value &lt; .05 . Subgroup analysis uncomplicated complicated appendicitis group undertake .</detailed_description>
