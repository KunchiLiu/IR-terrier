	<detailed_description>In less 15 year , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection reach level pandemic , acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) report 190 country . By end 2001 , 30 million people infected HIV worldwide , approximately one million infected reside North America one million reside Europe . Significant advance make treatment HIV disease . The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor provide early therapeutic intervention HIV infection . This class antiretroviral agent interfere replication HIV competitive inhibition HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme chain termination new HIV DNA nucleoside analogue incorporate . Subsequent development potent drug class , non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor , make possible use multidrug , multiclass regimen achieve durable suppression HIV replication . However , extensive resistance develop class drug , necessitate development potent class antiretroviral therapy . The integrase inhibitors new class antiretroviral drug . They inhibit catalytic activity HIV integrase , HIV encode enzyme require viral replication . Inhibition integrase prevents covalent insertion , integration , unintegrated linear HIV DNA host cell genome prevent formation HIV provirus . The provirus require direct production progeny virus , inhibit integration prevents propagation viral infection . Raltegravir ( RAL ) newly approve HIV integrase inhibitor . It approve salvage regimen ( Merck &amp; Co Inc. 2007 ) show promise first line therapy . Raltegravir potent vitro ; concentration 31 ± 20 nM result 95 % inhibition ( EC95 ) viral spread ( relative untreated virus-infected culture ) human T-lymphoid cell culture infect cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB . In addition , raltegravir concentration 6 50 nM result 95 % inhibition viral spread culture mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell infected diverse , primary clinical isolates HIV-1 , include isolates resistant reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor . RAL plasma concentration highly variable even control food intake UGT1A1*28 polymorphism . Despite variability , RAL remain efficacious study show little correlation various RAL pharmacokinetic parameter efficacy ( Wenning , Hwang et al . 2008 ) . This suggest although RAL exposure may important , plasma concentration may best marker RAL exposure . RAL exert effect HIV-infected cell inhibit HIV integrase . Therefore intracellular concentration correlate efficacy much plasma concentration . It possible RAL could accumulate inside HIV-infected cell intracellular concentration could less variable , explain sustain efficacy RAL despite variable plasma concentration . Intracellular half-life could also longer relatively short plasma half-life . This information could use justify daily administration RAL , zidovudine dose change five time twice daily intracellular zidovudine triphosphate much long half-life plasma zidovudine ( Barry , Khoo et al . 1996 ) . Measurement intracellular raltegravir could also aid therapeutic drug monitor assess drug-drug interaction . For example , rifampin reduces plasma concentration RAL almost 50 % ( Wenning , Hanley et al . 2009 ) . However , dose increase may necessary intracellular concentration maintain , think true zidovudine rifampin co-administration . To knowledge , data intracellular raltegravir . We therefore aim measure time course RAL intracellular concentration single dose healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
