	<brief_title>IV Plerixafor With Mitoxantrone Etoposide Cytarabine Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , seek target leukemia microenvironment overcome disease resistance . We hypothesize disrupt interaction leukemic blast bone marrow microenvironment , may sensitize leukemic blast effect cytotoxic chemotherapy . In current formulation , volume plerixafor require administer dose high 240 mcg/kg may result significant discomfort repeat daily injection . In phase I extension study , seek test safety high dos plerixafor well intravenous dose maximize inhibition target , CXCR4 .</detailed_description>
