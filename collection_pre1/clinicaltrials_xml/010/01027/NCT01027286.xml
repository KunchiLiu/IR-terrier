	<brief_summary>Vitagel® FDA approve class III medical device . It surgical hemostat , show control bleed orthopaedic , cardiac , hepatic , general surgical procedure . The product thrombin/collagen suspension work combination patient 's plasma form fibrin/collagen clot . The present prospective , randomize control trial design evaluate efficacy Vitagel® reduce blood loss pain patient manage unilateral total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . It hypothesize use Vitagel® may lead less blood fill knee , thus great improvement postoperative pain score compare control group . The two arm study include : 1. experimental group Vitagel® use unilateral TKA 2. control group represent current standard care ( Vitagel® ) A comparison functional clinical result two group conduct use several outcome measure include KOOS , SF-12 version2 pain score previously IRB approve OrthoMidas registry . The primary variable interest blood loss , base hemoglobin drop postoperative hospital stay . Of secondary interest ; 1 ) pain level PACU , 2 ) pain score postoperative day , 3 ) average pain entire hospital stay , 4 ) length stay , 5 ) patient satisfaction discharge , 4 week postoperative , 12 week postoperative , 6 ) functional score 4 12 week postoperative .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Vitagel Reduction Blood Loss Pain Following Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-center , randomize , double-blinded , clinical trial involve three orthopaedic surgeon perform total knee replacement . The propose study optimal obtain clinical functional comparison TKA surgical procedure utilizing conventional practice ( control ) TKA utilize Vitagel® , surgical hemostat use control bleed facilitate healing . The study include patient receive unilateral primary TKA . Fifty case assign arm study ( total 100 case ) . This sample size estimate use alpha 0.05 ( conventional study ) beta 0.80 ( recommend superiority study ) . The standard deviation base study conduct PI Cleveland Clinic IRB approve retrospective project 2007 , provide excess 80 percent statistical power detect less 100 ml difference blood loss two group . The study conduct Cleveland Clinic ( Cleveland , OH ) . The patient inform treatment assignment , research investigator make observation record data postoperatively also blind treatment assignment . The placement patient treatment arm base random draw sealed envelope . An assessment blinding conduct conclusion study ask patient treatment think receive . Data collect four timepoints , include preoperatively , hospital stay , 4 week postoperatively , 12 week postoperatively . Preoperative data collect include baseline SF-12 , KOOS , hemoglobin hematocrit level , pain score . Data collect hospital include hemoglobin hematocrit level , pain score , narcotic usage , length stay , patient satisfaction discharge . The SF-12 , KOOS , pain score , patient satisfaction collect utilize 4 week ( ±2 week ) standard care postoperative visit . Patients always see 12 week ( ±4 week ) postoperative timepoint standard care . To collect data , patient mail SF-12 , KOOS , pain score , patient satisfaction , blind assessment questionnaire . Patients respond initial mailer contact phone send second packet questionnaire .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age : 18 85 year Sex : Both male female include . The maletofemale ratio depend upon patient population . Stable Health : At time surgery base physical examination medical history . Patient exhibit preoperative radiographic evidence joint degeneration consistent TKA could treat nonoperative fashion . Patient severe knee pain disability due degenerative joint disease . Patient patient 's legal representative sign Informed Consent form . The patient capable making informed decision regard his/her healthcare . Patients history liver disease . Patients liver dysfunction cirrhosis hepatitis may impair production factor clot cascade may make individual prone bleed , especially use anticoagulant . For reason , patient also exclude study baseline INR great 1.3 . Patients allergic material bovine origin . Patients predonating autologous blood . Patients preoperative platelet count less 100,000 . Patients undergoing bilateral revision surgery . Evidence bleed metabolic base hemolytic disorder ( hemophilia anticoagulation use ) , hypercoaguable disorder . Previous history infection affect joint . Peripheral vascular disease . Patient poor compliance risk treat ethanol drug abuse , physical mental handicap , etc . Patients previous history venous thromboembolism , reason require anticoagulation ASA 325 mg po BID mechanical compression .</criteria>
