	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate role Alloderm tissue regenerative matrix use many breast reconstruction operation . When material use abdomen often stretch sometimes needs replace . Although see good clinical result use breast reconstruction , research regard material change location . The Alloderm place breast time expander place , post-mastectomy . The expansion start time surgery complete series office visit . This process stretch skin , underlie muscle presumably Alloderm . The goal study well understand natural history material use breast reconstruction . Our objective measure change dimension tissue matrix material place breast . These objective finding supplement patient questionnaire specifically design breast surgery patient . All patient receive standard preoperative work , intraoperative procedure , postoperative care indicate patient undergo implant breast reconstruction mastectomy . Some patient require use Alloderm reconstruct lower half breast pocket . This already do plastic surgeon Henry Ford Hospital . The difference Alloderm tissue matrix use reconstruct lower part breast pocket study patient 4 millimeter metallic clip place . Postoperatively clips track ultrasound do clinic . As breast implant normally expand add saline , believe Alloderm matrix stretch . The movement imperceptible clip track measure map expansion matrix response underlie implant stretch overlie breast pocket skin envelope . The pattern expansion allow u develop mathematical model describe stretch pattern Alloderm matrix use breast reconstruction . This information supplement validated questionnaire specifically design breast surgery patient . This give u objective dimensional change breast reconstruction well patient-centered evaluation reconstruction process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Describe experimental design/methodology.Prospective consecutive case series . 2 . Outline protocol , correspond specific aim ; identify data endpoint analyze reach specific aim . 1 . The first 3 candidate serve prototype model . There may unanticipated modification setup , patient care , image data analysis . We plan follow 3 case deliberately proceed 3 follow least 3 month . After 3 case , anticipate rest proceed smoothly . Placement clip provide data primary question 3 case . The schematic show presume change Alloderm size shape post expansion correspond change location vessel clip . The inferior border fix point . By position clip regular interval along top border , measure transverse horizontal change . The timing ultrasound study design coincide change likely visualized postoperative period . We may change date study . We anticipate total number study increase change full expansion ( complete postoperative week 4 ) slow small magnitude . 2 . 30 patient enrol study study position metallic marker postoperative day 1 , week 4 , month 6 , month 12 . The location clip relative fix anchor point record timepoint . The fixed anchor point medial-inner attachment point Alloderm® chest wall fascia . This inferior/medial point Alloderm® tissue matrix . With expansion breast expander chest wall fascia move . Only overlie skin , pectoralis muscle Alloderm stretch response breast prosthesis expansion . We therefore track movement clip embed matrix time . For clip develop best fit curve 30 subject study . This allow u develop mathematical model final position shape reconstruct breast one year . This model compare exist mathematical model breast tissue expanders ( Mentor Corp. 3 . A standardized validated questionnaire Breast-Q patient report outcome data instrument . The Breast-Q conceptually ground patient perception , able span continuum impact surgery validate appropriate psychometric benchmark . It allow quantification patient satisfaction health-related quality life experience woman undergo breast surgery . The questionnaire administer preoperative , one month postoperative one year postoperative . The BREAST-Q scoring software , QScore , give clinician researcher simple accurate way analyze data . It feature powerful score engine base RUMM 2020 ; data analyze program develop Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Models Laboratory Perth , Australia . Each pre postoperative BREAST-Q module come Microsoft Excel template . The template help organize data import QScore program . Once import , QScore automatically transform raw data summary score range 0 ( dissatisfy ) 100 ( satisfy ) scale . 3 . Discuss potential limitation difficulty protocol . Potential limitation include displacement vessel clip . If happens , patient 's result aesthetic outcome compromise . The clip cause harm . These patient follow standard care protocol remove study . 4 . Provide tentative schedule conduct complete project , applicable , multicenter study . The patient see office study enrollment post surgery one week , one month , six month one year evaluation ultrasound study . The Breast Q questionnaire complete preoperatively surgery one month one year . one month one year post surgery . We anticipate patient enrol within 6 month study initiation . Total project le 2 year last patient enrol . 5 . Data collection : Submit copy data collection tool list data field collect ( review IRB policy , Access Medical Records Research intranet http : //henry.hfhs.org ) . Data entry point collect include : The patient 's name , age , history steroid use , past medical history , date surgery , size graft use , thickness graft use . Also implant size , pre-surgery bra size , distance clip inferiolateral anchor point ultrasound . 7 . DATA ANALYSIS : Describe analysis data relate specific aim . Describe statistical analysis detail ( referral analysis multicenter sponsor acceptable ) . The Committee recommend free consultation Division Biostatistics Research Epidemiology . There two type outcome measurement : alloderm increase size stardardized validated questionnaire . We compare difference baseline time point implant . For alloderm increase size , student paired-t statistic wil use test stretch size . For questionnaire outcome , one-sample wilcoxon rank sum test use test difference patient satisfication . Bonferrnoi correction use multiple comparison familywise type I error rate set 0.05 .</detailed_description>
