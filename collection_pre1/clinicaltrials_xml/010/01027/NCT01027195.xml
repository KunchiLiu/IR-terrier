	<brief_summary>The present prospective , single-center , clinical trial design evaluate hemostatic efficacy hemostatic sealer Aquamantys 6.0™ patient manage total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . It hypothesize Aquamantys 6.0™ improve hemostasis follow total hip arthroplasty . Comparison functional clinical result THA patient expose Aquamantys 6.0™ versus control group analyze use several outcome measure include Harris Hip Score pain scale . The primary variable interest transfusion requirement - specifically , number patient manage blood transfusion hospital stay surgery . However , secondary interest : 1 ) number unit transfuse , 2 ) estimate intraoperative total blood loss , 3 ) change pre- post-operative hemoglobin level , 4 ) total narcotic usage hospital stay , 5 ) length stay , 6 ) functional pain outcome ( Harris Hip Score Pain Scale ) , 7 ) adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age : 18 85 year Sex : Both male female include . The maletofemale ratio depend upon patient population . Stable Health : At time surgery base physical examination medical history . Patient exhibit preoperative radiographic evidence joint degeneration consistent THA could treat nonoperative fashion . Patient severe hip pain disability due degenerative joint disease . Patient patient 's legal representative sign Informed Consent form . The patient capable making informed decision regard his/her healthcare . Patients history cardiac disease , liver disease renal disease . Severe cardiac disease , liver disease renal dysfunction confound different parameter within study . Patients decrease cardiac function prior myocardial infarction , cardiomyopathy congestive heart failure likely require transfusion pack red blood cell low threshold relative healthy counterpart cardioprotection . Therefore , patient prior history myocardial infarction , cardiomyopathy , congestive heart failure significant cardiac history exclude study . In addition , patient liver dysfunction cirrhosis hepatitis may impair production factor clot cascade may make individual prone bleed , especially use anticoagulant lovenox . For reason , patient also exclude study . Finally , individual renal dysfunction decrease creatinine clearance , may artificially elevate level lovenox , thereby promote bleed . In addition , individual severe renal disease may also associate anemia would complicate transfusion threshold . For reason , individual chronic renal failure , diabetic nephropathy , decrease creatinine clearance exclude study . Patients predonating autologous blood . Patients preoperative hemoglobin level less 11.5 g/dL hematocrit le 35 % . Patients preoperative platelet count less 100,000 . Patients undergoing bilateral revision surgery . Evidence bleed metabolic base hemolytic disorder ( hemophilia anticoagulation use ) Previous history infection affect joint . Peripheral vascular disease . Patient poor compliance risk treat ethanol drug abuse , physical mental handicap , etc . Patients whose personal belief exclude use blood transfusion ( example : Jehovah 's witness ) .</criteria>
