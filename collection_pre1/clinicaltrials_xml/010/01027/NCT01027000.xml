	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving low dos chemotherapy donor stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell . It may also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . Also , monoclonal antibody , rituximab , find cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . The donated stem cell may replace patient 's immune cell help destroy remain cancer cell ( graft-versus-tumor effect ) . Sometimes transplanted cell donor also make immune response body 's normal cell . Giving tacrolimus , sirolimus , methotrexate transplant may stop happen . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well donor stem cell transplant work treat patient high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine treatment improve 2-year current progression-free survival ( PFS ) early disease cohort compare historical control . Specifically , plan study whether achieve 2-year PFS ≥ 70 % exclude 2 year PFS ≤ 50 % Secondary - To determine whether advanced disease cohort achieve 2-year current PFS ≥ 50 % exclude 2-year PFS ≤ 30 % - To assess objective response rate . - To assess incidence grade 2-4 3-4 acute graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) . - To assess incidence extensive chronic GVHD . - To assess incidence treatment-related mortality 100 day 1 year - To assess overall survival - To assess donor chimerism CD3+ cell 1 2 year transplantation - To investigate presence donor antigen-specific T-cell clone withdrawal immune suppression . - To compare relapse profile patient T-cell response CLL whose CLL cell reactive - To prospectively examine impact high-risk genomic feature immune-based single nucleotide polymorphism response , toxicity , 2-year PFS reduce intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Preparative regimen : Patients receive 1 2 preparative regimen discretion participate institution . - Preparative regimen 1 : Patients receive rituximab IV day -7 , -1 , 7 , 14 fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute busulfan IV 3 hour day -5 -2. . - Preparative regimen 2 : Patients receive rituximab IV day -7 , -1 , 7 , 14 , fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day -5 -2 , cyclophosphamide IV 1-2 hour day -5 -3 . Patients match unrelated donor also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV 4-6 hour day -6 -4 . - Graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis : Patients receive preparative regimen 1 may receive either GVHD prophylaxis regimen 1 2 ; patient receive preparative regimen 2 may receive GVHD prophylaxis regimen 2 . - GVHD prophylaxis regimen 1 : Patients receive tacrolimus either orally IV oral sirolimus begin day -2 continue day 60 , follow taper day 180 . Patients also receive methotrexate IV day 1 , 3 , 6 . - GVHD prophylaxis regimen 2 : Patients receive tacrolimus either orally IV begin day -2 continue day 60 , follow taper day 180 . Patients also receive methotrexate IV day 1 , 3 , 6 , 11 . - Transplantation : Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation day 0 . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive rituximab IV 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month transplantation . Peripheral blood bone marrow aspirate sample may collect periodically correlative laboratory study . Patients follow periodically maximum 5 year study entry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Eligibility : 1 . Diagnosis Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia Bcell small lymphocytic lymphoma . Diagnosis accord International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( IWCLL ) 2008 Criteria 1 . Early Disease Cohort Patients early disease cohort must include one follow : FISH show deletion 17p ≥ 20 % cell ( either diagnosis time prior study entry ) either alone combination cytogenetic abnormality FISH show del 11q ≥ 20 % cell ( either diagnosis time prior study entry ) either alone combination cytogenetic abnormality , unless patient achieve complete remission IWCLL 2008 include CT scan , bone marrow morphology flow cytometry Failure achieve partial response initial chemotherapy , lack progression . These patient may receive second therapy improve response prior transplant . Patients , time first progression , 17p deletion FISH ≥ 20 % cell , either alone combination cytogenetic abnormality . The duration first progression specify . In addition , patient early disease cohort must follow : Received least 2 cycle induction therapy . It expect patient receive least 4 month therapy prior enrollment , require . Suggested regimen include limited following : fludarabine plus rituximab , fludarabine , cyclophosphamide plus rituximab , pentostatin , cyclophosphamide plus rituximab , bendumustine plus rituximab , alemtuzumab alone combination agent . Patients may receive 2 different regimen prior proceed transplantation . Nodes ≤ 5 cm 2 . Advanced Disease Cohort Patients advance disease cohort must include one follow : FISH show deletion 17p ≥ 20 % cell ( regardless interval initial therapy ) either alone combination cytogenetic abnormality First progression &lt; 24 month complete therapy . This include progression initial therapy . Second subsequent progression In addition , patient advance disease cohort must follow : Stable disease well Revised IWCLL 2008 NCI Criteria recent chemotherapy Nodes ≤ 5 cm 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 02 3 . Age Requirement Patients must ≥ 18 &lt; 70 year age 4 . Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Alemtuzamab There must least 4 week day 1 last cycle cytotoxic chemotherapy , alemtuzamab . 5 . Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Status Patients must HIV infection . Allogeneic transplantation HIV patient population welldefined likely requirement concomitant antiHIV therapy antiGVHD therapy would create potentially dangerous pharmacokinetic interaction among different agent could constrain therapeutic option control HIV GVHD . 6 . Hepatitis B C Patients must Hepatitis B sAg , antiHBc HCV . 7 . Diffusion capacity carbon monoxide DLCO must ≥ 40 % predict 8 .
