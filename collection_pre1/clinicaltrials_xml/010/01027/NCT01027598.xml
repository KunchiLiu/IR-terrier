	<brief_title>Randomized , Double-Blind Trial Erlotinib/Pazopanib Erlotinib/Placebo Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib current treatment standard second- third-line therapy advance NSCLC . Since angiogenesis inhibitor also show activity NSCLC , simultaneous inhibition EGFR VEGF pathway may improve efficacy therapy . In recently report Phase III trial ( Hainsworth et al . 2008 ) , combination bevacizumab erlotinib improved Progression- Free-Survival ( PFS ) vs. erlotinib alone give second-line therapy NSCLC ( 3.4 month vs. 1.7 month , respectively ; HR 0.63 ) . Pazopanib also inhibit angiogenesis pathway , may advantage bevacizumab include : ( 1 ) inhibition potentially important target , include PDGFR ; ( 2 ) convenient oral administration .</detailed_description>
