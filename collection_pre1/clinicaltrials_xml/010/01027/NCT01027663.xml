	<brief_summary>The purpose study perform laboratory base study determine growth development malaria parasite effect iron status host ( person infect malaria parasite ) . Iron deficiency affect 500 million people include many pregnant woman child area world plague malaria . Some population base study suggest iron deficiency protect people get malaria raise question wisdom public health policy provide universal iron supplementation country malaria common . We use red blood cell sera patient iron deficiency anemia , hereditary hemochromatosis normal individual take iron supplement look question systematic way . This study provide information possible mechanism iron deficiency may affect malaria parasite . The result contribute effort develop evidence-based public health policy iron supplementation policy malaria-endemic area . There three different type individual involve study ( 1 ) people iron deficiency anemia take iron supplementation ( 2 ) people without iron deficiency anemia take iron supplementation ( 3 ) people condition call hereditary hemochromatosis excess iron body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Host Iron Status Iron Supplement Use Erythrocytic Stage Plasmodium Falciparum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : This proposal aim study effect individual 's iron status iron supplementation growth viability malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum . The overall goal provide evidence support development evidence-based program improve global health policy iron supplementation area world high malaria transmission . Current WHO recommendation include routine supplementation woman child . Recently however , wisdom policy apply area afflict high rate malaria come scrutiny . This proposal study effect red blood cell ( RBCs ) serum iron overload patient ( hereditary hemochromatosis ) , iron deficient patient , iron replete individual take oral iron supplement . This proposal attempt identify mechanism human host 's iron status iron supplement use affect growth viability P. falciparum parasite red blood cell . Participants : Healthy adult volunteer , adult iron deficiency anemia , patient hereditary hemochromatosis enrol study . Fifteen individual recruit three setting . This study involve subject 18 year age males female include . Procedures ( method ) : Participation study involve undergo series screen test donation blood either single time point ( hemochromatosis patient ) total three pre-specified time point ( healthy volunteer iron deficiency ) . The healthy individual ask take oral iron supplement daily ( 325 mg ferrous sulfate ) duration study . Patient 's blood separate centrifugation RBCs serum , use vitro study impact iron status growth viability Plasmodium falciparum .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All study participant need meet follow eligibility criterion participation study : 1 . 18 year age old 2 . Agree HIV test 3 . No known malignancy 4 . Agree pregnancy test ( applicable ) 5 . Do sickle cell disease trait 6 . Do thalassemia thalassemia trait 7 . Not take iron supplementation 8 . Have O+ A+ blood group , 9 . Consent participate study In addition common study screen test , additional specific eligibility criterion three study group follow : 1 . Individuals iron deficiency : Iron deficiency diagnose use biochemical parameter list Serum iron : &lt; 40 µg/dL Iron binding capacity ( transferrin ) : &lt; 40 µg/dL Saturation ( SI/TIBC ) : &lt; 10 percent Hemoglobin : &lt; 9 g/dL Red cell morphology : Hypochromia microcytosis Plasma serum ferritin : &lt; 10 ng/mL 2 . Individuals Hereditary Hemochromatosis ( HH ) : In addition confirmation genetic testing , expect patient HH biochemical parameter list . From genotype standpoint , patient homozygous C282Y H63D mutation compound heterozygotes C282Y/H63D enrol . These mutation associate iron overload HH patient . Note different criterion men woman . Since woman ( without hemochromatosis ) great iron loss ( secondary menstruation ) comparison men , usually low iron store , low ferritin level low iron saturation . Biochemical parameter : Biochemical marker patient HH Serum iron : &gt; 65 µg/dL Saturation ( SI/TIBC ) : &gt; 60 % men ; &gt; 50 % woman Plasma serum ferritin : &gt; 300ng/mL men ; &gt; 200 ng/mL woman Each study participant diagnose ( via genetic test ) HH prior enrollment . 3 . Healthy volunteer : Patients HIV , pregnant , Sickle cell anemia/trait Thalassemia/Thal trait eligible participate study condition could interfere outcomes vitro study perform proposal .</criteria>
