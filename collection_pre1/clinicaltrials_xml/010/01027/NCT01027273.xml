	<brief_title>Prevent Return Stroke Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty nine percent 700,000 stroke occur yearly nationwide among stroke survivor . Blacks , nationally among Harlem resident , twofold increase recurrent stroke . Harlem Latinos threefold increase risk relative Whites . Primary risk factor recurrent stroke include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , use anti-thrombotic agent . Controlling risk factor particularly challenge low-income , minority population lack resource need adhere necessary therapy . In Harlem , 72 % adult study six month post stroke three risk factor treat adequately . We propose determine participation recurrent stroke prevention educational intervention , versus usual care , activate stroke survivor reduce primary risk factor recurrent stroke provide effective , low-cost , sustainable recurrent stroke prevention program neighborhood like Harlem , whose resident bear disproportionate burden suffering stroke . Specifically , propose : 1 . Recruit 600 adult sustain stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within past five year work Harlem community leader , local clinical site include Mount Sinai Medical Center Institute Family Health , Visiting Nurse Service New York ; 2 . To conduct randomize , control trial determine participation peer-led stroke prevention program activate stroke TIA survivor improve knowledge self-management strategy treatment related stroke prevention ; 3 . To rigorously compare impact intervention usual care ( delay intervention ) , increase proportion individual stroke TIAs appropriately treat reduce risk recurrent event , specifically control hypertension ( blood pressure ≤ 140/90mmHg ) , hyperlipidemia ( LDL cholesterol≤100 mg/dl ) use anti-thrombotic medicine .</detailed_description>
