	<brief_summary>Frequently glaucoma controlled clinical treatment ( `` eyedrop '' ) laser surgery control eye pressure . If raise pressure sustain long period time lead permanent damage optic nerve ( glaucoma ) severe case result blindness . You also cataracts , opacification natural lens inside eye impair vision . To prevent vision loss due glaucoma , doctor recommend glaucoma filtration surgery low eye pressure , cataract surgery time improve sight . The use anti-metabolite ( Mitomycin-C ) operation currently drug choice improve surgical outcome glaucoma filtration surgery . Mitomycin-C potent antiscarring agent reduces amount scar tissue produce surgery lead good control eye pressure . Although potent drug effective increase surgical success , use related high risk post surgical complication , sight threaten . The Collagen Matrix Implant biodegradable implant ( absorb naturally tissue ) , make porcine collagen , reduce scar tissue form glaucoma filtration surgery without use Mitomycin-C . This mean could less likely fail glaucoma filtration surgery , consequently , poor eye pressure control . In addition , risk surgical failure may reduce technique , use potent drug . However , long-term effect OculusGenTm implant glaucoma filtration surgery fully know . The aim study determine whether OculusGenTm implant equal success rate Mitomycin-C control eye pressure , without potentially sight threaten complication associate Mitomycin use . And time , study aim determine implant reduce potential complication relate glaucoma surgery compare combine surgery augment anti-proliferative agent . This study recruit 66 subject patient attend Singapore National Eye Centre period 12-24 month .</brief_summary>
