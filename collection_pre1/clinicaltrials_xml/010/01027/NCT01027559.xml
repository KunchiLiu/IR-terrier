	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research determine Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) heal effect brain people depression traditional anti-depressants , find cause depression people differ extent problem cause depression , determine certain difference gene within population related clinical symptom . We hypothesize CBT heal effect brain antidepressant ; difference brain activation create various task genetic difference help u understand difference type severity symptom among depressed subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall purpose research determine Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) heal effect brain people depression traditional anti-depressants , find cause depression people differ extent problem cause depression , determine certain difference gene within population related clinical symptoms.The gene examine study call `` COMT , BDNF , 5-HTT long arm short arm '' , well future gene may discover play role depression later time , determine examine sample saliva small blood sample . The method use study depression Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) take picture brain . This method allow u identify certain part brain show brain work control negative feeling . These picture compare 50 depressed individual 50 individual depress . Three task perform scan design cause activation brain area interested . In first task , subject match task stimulus match either face house flank distracters either face house . The goal participant task attend stimulus either horizontal vertical plane . On trial , non-task relevant stimulus ( distracters ) present non-attended plane . One trial distracter stimulus house , trial neutral face trial negative face . In second task , participant present pre-recorded statement use word list 555 personality/trait word compile Anderson ( 1968 ) . Examples statement `` I happy '' , `` You lucky '' , `` You dull '' , `` You greedy '' . For negative statement , participant instruct either passively listen statement decrease emotional response statement . For neutral statement , participant ask passively listen statements.Subjects ask much statement applies , 4-part Likert-type scale . In third task , subject ask focus attention single fixation point . This allow u measure rest state connectivity specific brain region .</detailed_description>
