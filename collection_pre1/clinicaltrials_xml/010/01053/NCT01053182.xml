	<brief_summary>Worldwide , esophageal cancer 6th common cause cancer-related death . Currently curative resection remain cornerstone therapy . Despite advance anesthesia , operative technique postoperative management , postoperative pulmonary complication ( PPCs ) occur frequently account 30 % postoperative complication . Most importantly , PPCs much associate postoperative mortality . The diaphragm important respiratory muscle respiratory function would inevitably damage esophagectomy perform left posterolateral thoracotomy ( Sweet procedure ) diaphragm must dissect purpose stomach moralization . Meanwhile , Ivor-Lewis approach may effectively avoid diaphragm injury stomach manage laparotomy whereas additional abdomen incision need . Both procedure routinely use practice surgically manage esophageal cancer . The investigator hypothesize Ivor-Lewis procedure might superior left-thoracotomy route esophagectomy prevent PPCs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esophagectomy Associated Respiratory Complications : Ivor-Lewis Versus Sweet Approaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Esophageal cancer common malignant tumor China worldwide poor prognosis . Although surgical resection combine adjuvant therapy constitute mainstay treatment esophagectomy-associated complication still life-threatening . Postoperative pulmonary complication ( PPCs ) , include pulmonary infection , atelectasis , edema ARDS ( acute respiratory distress syndrome ) lead cause eventful postoperative episode . The diaphragm well know essential respiratory muscle whose normal function guarantee 30 % pulmonary function . Esophagectomy leave thoracotomy would inevitably cut left diaphragm abdominal procedure thus greatly damage diaphragmatic function . It assume Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy would save pulmonary function great extent retain intact diaphragm addition laparotomy would unavoidable . However , hypothesis confirm randomize control trial adequate operation volume . At present , large part thoracic surgeon , example China , still prefer esophagectomy Sweet approach believe less traumatic . So far , presently convince evidence guide esophagectomy approach selection aspect prevention PPCs . Objectives : 1 . To compare PPCs rate Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy Sweet esophagectomy 2 . To compare degree diaphragm function deficiency two group . 3 . To compare pulmonary function result two group 4 . To compare degree gastric empty two group Diagnostic Criteria PPCs : one following anastomotic leak , massive pleural effusion non-pulmonary origin infection : 1. postoperative hypoxemia ( PaO2≤ 60mmHg and/or PaCO2≥ 50mmHg ) dyspnea 2. transfer intensive care unit due hypoxemia dyspnea 3. purulent pulmonary secretion require bronchoscopic suction 4. dependence oxygen mask nasal tube 5 day 5. infiltrate atelectasis one pulmonary lobe multiple segment identify chest X-ray film CT scan ) 6. postoperative hiatal hernia associate pulmonary dysfunction 7. dependence ventilator support 48h Degree diaphragm function : The distance diaphragmatic movement centimeter Pulmonary function measurement : FEV1 , FVC MMV Gastric empty function : Radioactivity remain 15 minute ingestion 100ml Tm99-labelled radioactive milk Design : Prospective randomized control trial . Setting : Thoracic Surgery Department , West China Hospital Sichuan University , Chengdu , China Patients method : All patient histologically confirm esophageal carcinoma locate middle low thoracic esophagus present hospital consider study Termination criterion : 1 . Intolerance treatment modality , 2 . Development PPCs 3 . Development severe complication , progressive bleeding , large pleural effusion , empyema 4 . Death Staging investigation standard include 1 . Computed Tomography ( CT ) Chest patient 2 . Fibroesophagoscopy patient 3 . Esophagogram barium swallow patient 4 . Endoscopic Ultrasonography ( EUS ) wherever possible Further investigation like bronchoscopy , PET scan , MRI apply indicate . Randomization : Complete randomization do use computer generate sheet . Randomization perform confirm resectability primary tumor enlarge lymph node . All surgery perform general anesthesia epidural analgesia . The surgery perform either Dr. Longqi Chen Dr. Yidan Lin faculty professor thoracic surgery department West China Hospital . Thoracic esophageal mobilization mediastinal lymphadenectomy do open thoracotomy . Stomach dissection gastric tube make do either leave diaphragm incision leave thoracotomy applied laparotomy Ivor-Lewis approach apply . Operative time , blood loss , blood product replacement intraoperative detail record proforma . Patients shift postoperatively intensive care unit ( ICU ) observation subsequently recovery high dependency ward stabilize . Postoperative detail include period postoperative ventilation , hemorrhage , pulmonary cardiac complication , arrhythmia , thoracic duct leak , anastomotic leak , wound infection recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis palsy record . Postoperative mortality define 30-day mortality plus death discharge surgery . Patients start oral feed 8th 10th day absence anastomotic leak . The total duration ICU stay hospital stay also record . Sample size : The sample size consider improvement morbidity sever pulmonary complication 15 % 5 % 280 patient ( 140 arm ) . The trial aim enrol 320 patient order adjust protocol violation . Interim analyse do ½ ( 160 event ) estimate event occur . We expect complete accrual patient three year . Follow : No follow discharge . The long-term pulmonary function concern clinical trail . Data management : All collect data enter statistical software package subsequent analysis</detailed_description>
