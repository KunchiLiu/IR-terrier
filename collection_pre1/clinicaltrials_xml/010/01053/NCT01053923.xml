	<brief_title>MRI Tumor During Chemoradiation Anal Canal Perianal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anal cancer uncommon cancer , account 2 % gastrointestinal cancer . Prognostic factor include tumor differentiation staging , along patient gender , race , socioeconomic status . The standard care radical chemoradiation 5-fluorouracil mitomycin C , surgery reserve salvage . Intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) specialize radiotherapy technique may use anal cancer . IMRT allow radiation dose conform three-dimensional shape target volume conventional two-dimensional technique , may reduce treatment toxicity without compromise tumor control . At Princess Margaret Hospital ( PMH ) since July 2007 , IMRT treatment phase radiotherapy implemented standard treatment patient anal canal perianal cancer .</detailed_description>
