	<brief_summary>Low blood sugar also call hypoglycemia . Usually , mild treat quickly easily eat drink small amount sugar-rich food . If low blood sugar leave untreated , get bad cause confusion , clumsiness fainting . Severe hypoglycemia lead seizure , coma , even death . Some people diabetes early warn sign low blood sugar . This condition call hypoglycemia unawareness . It happen body stop react low blood sugar level person realize need treat hypoglycemia . This lead severe dangerous hypoglycemia . The purpose early study see drug call naltrexone studied people Type I diabetes hypoglycemia unawareness . This study show whether naltrexone could reduce hypoglycemia unawareness . The study also show , use magnetic resonance imaging ( also call MRI ) , whether naltrexone change way blood flow brain person experience hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naltrexone Hypoglycemia Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visit 1 This visit estimate last approximately 1 hour . At visit , ask complete questionnaire hypoglycemia unawareness . Some question medical history may ask order make sure eligible study . You also blood collected test measure liver kidney work . A blood test measure muscle breakdown also do . If female could become pregnant , pregnancy test also do . The amount blood collect visit approximately three teaspoon . This visit estimate last approximately one hour . You ask wear continuous glucose monitor ( CGMS ) around clock seven day MRI study . This involve put small plastic sensor skin stomach carry monitor attache sensor . The sensor measure glucose record reading automatically monitor . The monitor size palm woman 's hand . The information store monitor send computer researcher use . The researcher insert CGMS visit 1 . Between Visit 1 Visit 2 You also ask keep careful record study every day next seven day . You ask check blood glucose three meal go sleep night . You also ask write blood glucose level bring record back researcher . Visit 2 Seven day visit 1 asked report Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) 7:30AM first MRI scan . The study do morning overnight fast . All subject ask fast minimum 8 hour arrive center . The researcher advise adjust insulin regimen 1-2 day MRI scan sure blood sugar good control arrive CMRR . Alternatively , may ask come Clinical Research Unit night MRI study You admit Clinical Research Unit , stay overnight . You give food even meal test complete lunch time follow day . Your even dose long-acting insulin pump hold 6:00 p.m. evening . Your blood glucose measure every 1-2 hour . An intravenous ( IV ) catheter place arm stay test next day . You give insulin glucose need keep blood sugar 100 150 mg/dl night lead test next day . In morning , transfer Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) MRI . At CMRR , IV place arm . This allow give insulin , glucose potassium test . A third IV place one leg . This catheter put blood collect test . After catheter leg place rest 30 minute . After thirty minute , blood collect catheter leg laboratory test . The test ready begin . You give insulin catheter one arm place MRI machine . Your glucose check every five minute throughout study . Blood also collect every 30 minute laboratory test . When glucose drop 50 mg/dl hold level approximately 30 minute measure blood flow glucose concentration brain take . While blood sugar dropping , ask symptom may feel . After measure take , insulin give IV stop give glucose bring back normal level . You CMRR 4-6 hour . After test complete , IVs take , resume usual diabetes treatment , feed meal . Between time admit Clinical Research Unit time discharge MRI test , le one cup blood collect . You give supply naltrexone , study medication , placebo , instruction take medication next four week . You randomly assign ( like flip coin ) naltrexone , placebo ( pill contain medicine ) . Neither study doctor know study treatment ( placebo naltrexone ) receiving . If becomes necessary know medical reason , information make available . Between Visits 2 3 While take naltrexone placebo ask use Tylenol ( product contain acetaminophen ) , Advil ( product contain ibuprofen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) , aspirin . You also ask avoid alcohol take naltrexone . If concern question use substance time take naltrexone please ask study doctor coordinator . You always take naltrexone dose right eat meal . Days 1 - 5 : Starting day MRI test , ask take one 25 mg tablet naltrexone placebo day next five day . Days 6 - 10 : On day ask take one 50 mg tablet naltrexone placebo day . Days 11- 14 : On day ask take one 50 mg tablet naltrexone placebo twice day . Visit 2 study occur Day 14 . Visit 3 This visit estimate last approximately 30 minute . You come Clinical Research Unit short visit day . Blood collect test measure liver kidney work . A blood test measure muscle breakdown also do . Just like visit 1 , amount blood collect visit approximately three teaspoon . The study doctor coordinator also talk feeling . You ask whether take naltrexone placebo accord study plan . Between Visits 3 4 Days 15 - 21 : On day ask take one 50 mg tablet naltrexone placebo twice day . Visit 4 This visit estimate last approximately 30 minute . You ask wear continuous glucose monitor ( CGMS ) around clock seven day MRI study . This involve put small plastic sensor skin stomach carry monitor attache sensor . The sensor measure glucose record reading automatically monitor . The monitor size palm woman 's hand . The information store monitor send computer researcher use . The researcher insert CGMS visit 4 . Between Visits 4 5 Days 22 - 28 : On day ask take one 50 mg tablet naltrexone placebo twice day . You take last study dose naltrexone placebo Day 28 . Starting Day 22 , like first part study , also ask keep careful record study every day time . You ask check blood glucose three meal go sleep night . You also ask write blood glucose level bring record back researcher . Visit 5 Just like first part study , ask report Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) 7:30AM first MRI scan . The study do morning overnight fast . All subject ask fast minimum 8 hour arrive center . The researcher advise adjust insulin regimen 1-2 day MRI scan sure blood sugar good control arrive CMRR . Alternatively , ask come Clinical Research Unit night MRI study . You come day take last dose naltrexone placebo . You admit Clinical Research Unit , stay overnight . You give food even meal test complete lunch time follow day . Your even dose long-acting insulin pump hold 6:00 p.m. evening . Your blood glucose measure every 1-2 hour . An intravenous ( IV ) catheter place arm stay test next day . You give insulin glucose need keep blood sugar 100 150 mg/dl night lead test next day . In morning , transfer Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) MRI . Blood collect test measure liver kidney work . A blood test measure muscle breakdown also do . The procedure Visit 5 exactly procedure Visit 2 . The difference give naltrexone placebo end visit . When complete Visit 5 , participation study complete . At CMRR , IV place arm . This allow give insulin , glucose potassium test . A third IV place one leg . This catheter put blood collect test . After catheter leg place rest 30 minute . After thirty minute , blood collect catheter leg laboratory test . The test ready begin . You give insulin catheter one arm place MRI machine . Your glucose check every five minute throughout study . Blood also collect every 30 minute laboratory test . When glucose drop 50 mg/dl hold level approximately 30 minute measure blood flow glucose concentration brain take . While blood sugar dropping , ask symptom may feel . After measure take , insulin give IV stop give glucose bring back normal level . You CMRR 4-6 hour . After test complete , IVs take , resume usual diabetes treatment , feed meal . Between time admit Clinical Research Unit time discharge MRI test , le one cup blood collect .</detailed_description>
