	<brief_summary>This randomized trial enroll adult recipient HLA-identical living kidney transplant least 1 year post-transplant . All subject take Prograf ( tacrolimus ) cyclosporine mycophenolic acid ( CellCept Myfortic ) randomize ( 1:2 ) either continue calcineurin inhibitor taper calcineurin inhibitor . The hypothesis mycophenolic acid monotherapy permit long-term rejection-free renal allograft function absence long-term calcineurin inhibitor fully match renal transplant cohort .</brief_summary>
