	<brief_summary>The incidence severe morbidity mortality follow influenza infection annual influenza epidemic high among elderly population 90 % influenzaassociated mortality occur group . Vaccination consider best preventive intervention available offer partial protection . The protective effect decrease advance age exist co-morbidity . Therefore , spite high compliance vaccination , risk influenza-related complication among nursing-home resident , particularly high , consequently also associate disease economic burden . There debate potential health benefit antiviral activity oseltamivir effective supplementary intervention prevent contain influenza outbreak nurse home . Although effectiveness post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) oseltamivir prevent transmission demonstrate trial among healthy ( mainly unvaccinated ) adult child , effectiveness yet assess among vulnerable vaccinate highrisk group , elderly population nursing home . If prove ( cost ) effective , oseltamivir could considerable benefit set , although constraint relate implementation need address well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective If prove ( cost ) effective , without induce antiviral resistance , oseltamivir could considerable benefit set , although constraint relate implementation need address well . If ( cost ) effective fragile population , resource well spent activity support nursing home resident . Study design : A randomised control trial effect PEP oseltamivir versus placebo transmission influenza nursing home , link virological monitoring possible development resistance impact transmission outcome , link cost effectiveness analysis , exploration logistical ethical issue could interfere successful implementation . Study population : This trial nest recently establish Network Nursing Homes ( SNIV ) . SNIV initiate coordinated RIVM Centre Infectious Disease Control . Baseline data population nursing home already routinely collect , epidemiological virological surveillance ILI/influenza establish , collaboration local laboratory . Intervention : Post-exposition prophylaxis oseltamivir placebo . Once laboratory confirmation obtain index case , resident implicate unit randomly assign PEP either oseltamivir 75 mg placebo daily 10 day . Data co-morbidity , medication potential confounders susceptibility clinical influenza infection collect prior start PEP . The index patient ( secondary patient ) treat therapeutically oseltamivir . Main study parameters/endpoints : Transmission , primary trial outcome measurement , define newly laboratory confirm influenza unit 12 hour start PEP . Assuming 30 home participate , annually 30 % nursinghomes experience confirm influenza outbreak average two unit , recruit 20 unit per season . Assuming without effective prophylaxis ongoing transmission occur 40 % unit , least 80 % power 3 season two-sided alpha=0.05 demonstrate reduction transmission 70 % . Furthermore , trial offer excellent opportunity evaluate possible emergence resistance oseltamivir use circumstance , analyse occurrence viral mutation oseltamivir therapy ( index- secondary case ) . In addition , assess relative cost-effectiveness PEP oseltamivir per nursing home unit , compare use PEP prospectively collect information number influenza infection related complication , duration symptom , use medical service secondary case , well sickness leave staff . Finally , potential ethical logistical restriction large scale use oseltamivir document prospectively . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Burden risk trial minimal , deviate current standing practice , nurse home offer PEP others n't , follow diagnosis influenza unit .</detailed_description>
