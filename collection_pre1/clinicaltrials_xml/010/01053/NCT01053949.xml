	<brief_title>IFM2009-02-Pomalidomide Dexamethasone Phase 2 Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable disease characterize accumulation clonal plasma cell bone marrow . The median overall survival patient MM approximately 4-5 year . Despite front line treatment approach , disease eventually relapse . The recent US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval bortezomib ( 2003 ) combination lenalidomide plus dexamethasone ( 2006 ) therapy treatment previously treat MM provide effective therapeutic option give patient relapse refractory MM prospect prolongation overall progression-free survival time . However , MM remain incurable disease . A clear unmet medical need still exist additional novel therapeutic option treatment previously treat MM . Pomalidomide belong IMiDs class compound thalidomide parent compound lenalidomide recently approve agent . It derive thalidomide share number beneficial pharmacologic property thalidomide . The efficacy thalidomide limited adverse effect . This toxicity profile seem dose duration-related , spur development IMiDs , potential improve potency reduce toxicity . By modify thalidomide structure addition amino group 4 position phthaloyl ring generate pomalidomide , compound 50000 time potent inhibit TNF-alpha thalidomide form . Recently , preliminary efficacy safety data ongoing phase 2 study , lead Martha Lacy , et al , Mayo Clinic , present XII International Myeloma Workshop Washington DC ( 01 March 2009 ) . The study highlight 63 % objective response 5 % complete response patient take pomalidomide ( 2 mg daily day 1-28 28-day cycle ) plus dexamethasone ( 40 mg daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle ) include patient lenalidomide resistant refractory multiple myeloma . The result also show treatment well tolerate . Based encourage data study , phase 1/2b multi-center , randomize , open-label , dose escalation study ( dose level 2 mg 5 mg daily day 1-21 28-day cycle ) conduct determine MTD pomalidomide . This ongoing study evaluate safety efficacy oral pomalidomide alone , combination dexamethasone , patient relapse refractory MM . The first result obtain study demonstrated maximum tolerate dose pomalidomide 4 mg per day highlight pomalidomide significant efficacy MM safely administer myeloma patient . Moreover , increase number patient refractory respond significantly experience significant toxicity either bortezomib lenalidomide . Based study , hypothesize patient might benefit combination pomalidomide dexamethasone . We therefore design multicenter phase 2 randomize open label study determine response pomalidomide dexamethasone relapse refractory MM patient progressive achieve least partial response bortezomib lenalidomide . This study determine efficacy toxicity profile 2 modality pomalidomide patient advanced myeloma , previously heavily treat characterized adverse prognostic desperate need novel therapeutic . This study conduct accordance `` good clinical practice '' ( GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement , include , applicable , 2008 version Declaration Helsinki .</detailed_description>
