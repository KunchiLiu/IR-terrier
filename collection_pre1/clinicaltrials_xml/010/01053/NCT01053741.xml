	<brief_title>Effect Seminal Fluid Colon Wall ; Implications HIV Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design effective rectal microbicides prevent HIV infection require understanding rectal HIV transmission location within low gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract ( luminal mucosal ) HIV ( cell-free cell-associated ) follow exposure infect seminal fluid . These basic detail HIV transmission yet determine human subject , yet essential select microbicide candidate rationally design achieve effective concentration sit HIV transmission . Rational development rectal microbicide also require understanding factor may contribute colonic mucosal injury - potential confounders microbicidal effect . Such factor include exposure seminal fluid show animal vitro study cause histologic permeability change might facilitate HIV transmission .</detailed_description>
