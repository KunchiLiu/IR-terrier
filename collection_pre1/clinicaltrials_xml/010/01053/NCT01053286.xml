	<brief_summary>This research study learn whether capsaicin , natural ingredient chili pepper make taste `` hot '' , improve swallow function . The purpose study evaluate whether suck capsaicin lozenge improve sensation throat enough improve swallow function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stimulation Sensation Improvement Swallowing Using Oral Capsaicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Swallowing problem encounter frequently primary practice hospital setting . The list possible cause large , range stroke neurological disease complication cancer treatment , acid reflux , surgery . Many patient reduce ability feel food fluid ( reduced sensation ) within throat ( pharynx ) lead inability manipulate food fluid correct manner . This produce variety swallow problem choke food fluid , regurgitation , aspiration , weight loss , malnutrition poor quality life . Treatment largely direct rehabilitation muscle power education safe swallow technique position limit food fluid enter airway . A novel approach try improve sensation within pharynx patient feel substance present manipulate appropriate safe manner . In regard capsaicin , nutritional supplement derive pepper , show stimulatory effect sensory nerve ability improve swallow reflex ( Ebihara et al. , 2005 ) . Although study show capsaicin improve swallow reflex , data regard improvement swallow function lacking . Using small dose capsaicin administer lozenge , hope stimulate sensation within pharynx enough improve physical swallowing measure contrast swallow study . This method application comfortable , easy direct site action .</detailed_description>
