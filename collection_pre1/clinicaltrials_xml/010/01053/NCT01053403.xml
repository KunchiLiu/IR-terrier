	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure effect MDMA sleep , mood , thinking , body retain water . The researcher interested effect occur hour take MDMA well effect occur next two day . We study effect standardize , control set Clinical Translational Science Institute ( CTSI ) Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) locate San Francisco General Hospital . The primary hypothesis : 1 . MDMA induce sleep disruption , indicate comprehensive polysomnography , wrist actigraphy , self-report sleep measure 2 . MDMA alter sodium water homeostasis either increase blunt suppression arginine vasopressin level decrease free water excretion . Effects exacerbate water loading . Secondary hypothesis : 1 . Acutely , MDMA increase positive negative arousal , increase sociability autonomy . 2 . Acutely , MDMA increase risk-taking willingness donate money others economic decision make task . 3 . MDMA decrease stressful effect talk negatively-valenced autobiographical increase recall detail episode . 4 . MDMA increase oxidative stress marker possible ameliorate factor ( e.g. , ADMA ) . 5 . The short form serotonin transport promoter region associate great acute discontinuation effect MDMA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This placebo-controlled , double-blind , gender balance , within-subject study acute 24 48 hour post dose effect ( discontinuation syndrome ) MDMA sleep architecture , water homeostasis neurocognitive function . We define sign symptom sleep disruption time course alteration ADH level neurocognitive function occur administration single dose MDMA experience user . The immediate effect MDMA include euphoria intoxication ; 24 hour MDMA positive effect replace lowered mood lethargy - refer effect discontinuation syndrome . The pleasurable effect MDMA think due elevation serotonin , norepinephrine dopamine ; mechanism post-MDMA depression unknown may due relative serotonin depletion . Among many function serotonin maintains normal sleep architecture . The effect MDMA discontinuation sleep architecture assess use comprehensive polysomnography wrist actigraphy measure obtain ~36 hour single dose MDMA . Cognitive measurement explore acute effect MDMA . MDMA produce hyponatremia . In study evaluate effect MDMA ADH release , urine sodium excretion , relationship gender effect .</detailed_description>
