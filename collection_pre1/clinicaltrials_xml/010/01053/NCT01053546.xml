	<brief_title>Effects Swallowing Exercises Patients Undergoing Radiation Treatment Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To assess difference early late onset swallowing exercise swallow quality life patient undergoing chemo/radiation therapy head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To assess difference early late onset swallowing exercise swallow function patient undergo radiation therapy head neck cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVE : I . To assess difference early late onset swallowing exercise : individual domain swallow quality life ; Penetration Aspiration Scale ( PAS ) assess via FEES ; diet level ( Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale ( DOSS ) assess via FEES ; feed tube duration ( day ) ; Eating Assessment Tool ( EAT ) ; lingual strength assess via lingual manometry ; percent weight loss percent weight recovery . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I ( Early exercise group ) : Patients perform swallow exercise comprise lingual press , head lift , breath hold , Masako swallow , high pitch e , effortful swallow , neck stretch massage 2 week prior begin radiotherapy immediately completion radiotherapy . Arm II ( Late exercise group ) : Patients begin perform swallowing exercise arm I 1 month completion radiotherapy . In arm , swallow exercise perform twice daily , 6 day week , 12 month follow completion radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
