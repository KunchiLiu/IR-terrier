	<brief_summary>Study objectives To evaluate safety echinocandin anidulafungin prophylaxis treatment invasive fungal infection ( IFI ) hematologic patient . Study design , Study conduct period Prospective , open label , phase II , one arm , single centre study October 2009 - September 2010 Study population Twenty adult patient ( ≥ 18 year ) hematologic disorder indication antifungal prophylaxis therapy , relative contraindication azoles polyenes due hepatic renal dysfunction respectively Methods Main Out-come Variables Main Outcome Parameter Safety : Adverse event change important laboratory parameter clinical impact report . Secondary Outcome Parameter Efficacy : In therapeutically use outcome categorize success failure . For patient receive anidulafungin prophylaxis number rate breakthrough infection document . Risk assessment Treatment related adverse effect report approved physician prescribe information ( usually mild incidence &lt; 5 % ) . Treatment failure due resistant pathogen . Expected benefit study IFI major cause death among hematological patient , especially undergoing high dose chemotherapy . It conceivable anidulafungin new treatment option patient azoles polyenes relatively contraindicate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment patient hematologic disorder frequently complicate invasive fungal infection ( IFI ) . The current spectrum pathogen patient population characterise increase rate aspergillosis , atypical mould yeast , might explain extended application myelosuppressive chemotherapy prophylactic use antibiotic therapy , also sensitive diagnostic tool . Although several new antifungal drug approve recently treatment invasive fungal infection , mortality rate remain unacceptably high . In patient suspected IFI invasive diagnostic procedure often perform due thrombocytopenia blood test fungal antigen ELISA PCR-methods additive tool time . Thus , antifungal drug frequently apply empirically neutropenic fever persist despite antibiotic therapy preemptive case radiological laboratory suspicion IFI . The antifungal armamentarium consist mainly azoles , polyenes , echinocandins . Therapy azoles frequently complicate hepatological side effect drug interaction , whereas application polyenes often associate worsen renal function , severe hypopotassemia shivering . Because favourable efficacy outstanding safety profile , nowadays echinocandins increasingly use hematologic ward , especially patient renal liver comorbidity . Anidulafungin novel echinocandin potent invitro fungicidal activity several pathogen yeast mould like Candida- Aspergillus spp . It recently approve EMEA treatment invasive candidiasis non-neutropenic patient . A low cytochrome P450 interaction profile report dose adaption case hepatical renal impairment recommend . In pivotal clinical trial anidulafungin achieve superior response rate treatment invasive candida infection comparison fluconazole . In trial , quarter patient cancer 3 % neutrophil count 500/cm3 blood randomisation . Although clinical experience efficacy tolerability anidulafungin adult hematologic patient limit , Infectious Diseases Society America recently recommend anidulafungin use neutropenic patient candidiasis . Primary endpoint : Safety : For patient receive anidulafungin without regard indication incidence ( serious ) adverse event change important laboratory parameter ( particular liver renal function parameter ) clinical impact report . Secondary endpoint : Pharmacokinetics Efficacy For patient receive anidulafungin prophylaxis number rate breakthrough infection report . If breakthrough infection occur type salvage therapy outcome also document . For patient receive anidulafungin treatment current episode fungal infection primary efficacy outcome define proportion patient alive week six inclusion study time patient censor . A second evaluation survival do week 12 . Reason death analyze accord toxicity study drug progression IFI , respectively . The efficacy outcome categorize following : Success : Complete response : Survival within prespecified period observation , resolution attributable symptom sign disease radiological abnormality , mycological evidence eradication disease . Partial response : Survival within prespecified period observation , improvement attributable symptom sign disease radiological abnormality , evidence clearance culture reduction fungal burden , assess quantitative validated laboratory marker . Failure : Stable response : Survival within prespecified period observation minor improvement fungal disease , evidence progression , determine basis composite clinical , radiological , mycological criterion . Progression : Evidence progressive fungal disease base composite clinical , radiological , mycological criterion . Death : Death prespecified period evaluation , regardless attribution . Survival data ( overall mortality attributable mortality , applicable ) patient time-to-negativity blood culture report study .</detailed_description>
