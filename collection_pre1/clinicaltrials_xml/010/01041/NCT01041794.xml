	<brief_summary>Early childhood ( ~4-6 year age ) important window determine body composition trajectory may critical period development tissue partition pattern influence later disease risk , include obesity type 2 diabetes . As adiposity accelerate critical period , deposition/ preservation fat store may sustain 'expense ' tissue ; i.e . energy homeostasis may inherently bias toward fat gain . The type amount tissue mass accrue early childhood implication metabolic profile , glucose/insulin homeostasis , hormone profile rest energy expenditure . The interplay fat bone deposition represent physiologic trait enable body choose shuttle 'energy ' towards accrual particular tissue . Plausibly phenotype underlie obesity diabetes risk may determine differentiation cell type ( adipocyte , osteocyte , etc . ) early stage growth development . In vitro study demonstrate transdifferentiation influence specific external stimulus , switch phenotype toward cell lineage . Further , rodent model demonstrate exposure stimulus ( exercise ) early life may prevent excess fat mass accrual adulthood , even stimulus later remove ( animal longer exercise ) . Children 's early experience ( engagement physical activity ) may 'environmentally induce ' alteration body composition predispose individual diabetes throughout life ( Figure 1 ) . Hypotheses Specific Aims : Early growth pattern cell differentiation may induce long term effect body composition impact biological hormonal ax regulate childhood body composition . Body composition comprise absolute mass , also aspects size , shape location . To end , follow specific aim evaluate : 1 . Quantify body composition , adipose tissue distribution , relative tissue ratio use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . 1 . Hypothesis : Early partitioning 'resources ' toward fat mass accrual lead decrease gain bone mass may persist long-term . 2 . Hypothesis : Partitioning tissue toward fat expense bone mass ( indirectly , lean mass ) result adverse effect glucose/insulin metabolism , total energy expenditure , rest metabolic rate hormone signal . 3 . Hypothesis : Children great level physical activity ( energy expenditure ) great partition towards bone ( lean ) mass . 2 . Quantify adipose tissue distribution adipocyte cell size number use MRI histological technique . 1 . Hypothesis : A relatively great amount bone marrow adipose tissue apparent child low level physical activity , result preferential differentiation pluripotent stem cell towards adipocytes vs osteocytes bone marrow cavity . 2 . A relatively great adipocyte cell number apparent child low level physical activity indicate great differentiation MSC towards adipocytes vs osteocyte .</brief_summary>
