	<brief_title>Safety Study Liposomal Docetaxel Formulation Patients With Solid Tumors Who Have Failed Previous Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority advance stage human cancer fatal treat promptly aggressively . Standard treatment include chemotherapy , radiation therapy surgery . Docetaxel , active ingredient ATI-1123 FDA approve drug Taxotere , chemotherapy give IV patient treat various type cancer . Docetaxel poorly water soluble semi-synthetic taxane analog commonly use treatment variety solid tumor include non-small cell lung , prostate , breast , gastric head neck cancer . Because poor water solubility formulate co-solvents potentially contribute treatment related adverse event hypersensitivity . Current taxane formulation often complicate drug delivery alter pharmacokinetic toxicity profile . Results nonclinical evaluation show ATI-1123 retains antineoplastic activity docetaxel remove need unwanted solvent like Tween 80 . The administration ATI-1123 versus docetaxel chemotherapy formulation expect reduce hypersensitivity reaction ( redness , swell , itch infusion site ) , eliminate requirement premedications , broad therapeutic index , enhance systemic docetaxel exposure .</detailed_description>
