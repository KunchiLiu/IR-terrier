	<detailed_description>The epidemic overweight obesity United States America along comorbidities continue expand . Bariatric surgery demonstrate effective sustained method control severe obesity comorbidities . For instance , type 2 diabetes mellitus completely resolve 76.8 % , systemic arterial hypertension resolve 61.7 % , dyslipidemia improve 70 % obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome resolve 85.7 % . Furthermore , bariatric surgery significantly increase life expectancy ( 89 % ) decrease overall mortality ( 30-40 % ) , particularly deaths diabetes , heart disease , cancer . Lastly , preliminary evidence downstream saving associate bariatric surgery offset initial cost 2 4 year . Since 1998 , substantially progressive increase bariatric surgery . In 2005 , ASMBS report 81 % bariatric procedure approach laparoscopically 2007 , 205,000 people bariatric surgery United States approximately 80 % Gastric Bypass . Moreover , mismatch eligibility receipt bariatric surgery le 1 % eligible population treat morbid obesity bariatric surgery . Along increase number elective primary weight loss procedure , 20 % post RYGB patient sustain weight loss beyond 2 3 year primary bariatric procedure . Thus , revisional surgery poor weight loss re-operations technical mechanical complication rise parallel manner . A common late complication gastric bypass surgery marginal ulceration , ulcer margin gastrojejunostomy jejunal side . Its incidence RYGB range low 0.6 high 16 % . After 1,040 laparoscopic RYGB surgery , incidence rate , hand , 1.4 % mainly related NSAID´s use . In observational cohort study , presence specific technical factor - staple-line dehiscence gastro-gastric fistula , enlarge pouch , foreign material local ischemia - environmental factor - tobacco , NSAID´s , alcohol consumption , H pylori infection among others - associate marginal ulceration however exact etiopathogenesis completely elucidate . Similar peptic ulcer disease ( PUD ) , marginal ulcer respond medical therapy , specifically sucralfate acid-lowering medication . In contrast , perforation , obstruction , penetration , bleed and/or intractability present , complex complicate ulcer disease , warrant surgical intervention . The intestinal mucosa typically expose gastric acid , neutralized alkaline biliopancreatic secretion . The jejunal mucosa natural barrier ; expose gastric acid , ulcerate easily . Capella &amp; Capella demonstrate transect gastric segment significantly reduce staple-line dehiscence ; so-called divide gastric bypass . In retrospective analysis consecutive series , incidence gastro-gastric fistula ( GGF ) formation undivided gastric bypass ( GBP ) 23 % , partially divide GBP 19 % , completely divide GBP 2 % complete transection interposition jejunal limb 0 % ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . MacLean et al confirm divided primary gastric bypass decrease GGF formation ( 29 % vs. 3 % ) . Also , patient develop marginal ulcer low pH well great time pH le 2 correlate 100 % presence GGF ; closure GGF increase pH pouch subsequent heal marginal ulcer . An unusually large gastric pouch ( horizontal pouch , retain fundus , long less curvature base pouch enlarge initially size adequately ) contain acid-producing parietal cell . Increased acid production pouch carry risk develop marginal ulcer . Acid secretion small pouch RYGB virtually absent . Smith et al measure basal pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion pouch significantly low compare age sex-matched control . Likewise , MacLean et al report significantly low pH &amp; great time pH &lt; 2 gastric pouch marginal ulcer and/or GGF patient RYGB compare non-complicated RYGB control . Thus , create esophagojejunostomy would solve gastric acid factor develop marginal ulcer however high incidence anastomotic failure unknown weight loss result prohibitive approach . Sapala et al create micro-pouch cardiojejunostomy decrease maximum parietal cell mass low incidence marginal ulcer ( 0.01 % 1 year follow-up ) well limit pouch dilation . By Histopathology semi-quantitative approach , Gustavsson et al report less acid-producing parietal cell within small pouch . With next study ( n=12 ) , Gustavsson et al , demonstrate significantly high time exposure pH &lt; 4 patient marginal ulcer RYGB ( 4x3cm pouch ) compare control ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . Furthermore , downsize pouch , repeat pH-metry show % time pH &lt; 4 decline 100 % prior 6 % revisionary surgery . The anastomotic technique influence incidence marginal ulcer . Capella &amp; Capella report consecutive series significant decrement 5.1 % 1.5 % ( p &lt; 0.001 ) switch staple hand-sewn anastomosis . Likewise , change inner layer absorbable suture outer layer nonabsorbable material double-layer absorbable suture incidence rate improve 1.6 % 0 % . Dr Schauer´s group confirm significant improvement incidence rate MU 2.6 % use nonabsorbable suture outer layer 1.3 % change absorbable suture layer ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Local ischemia , immediate postoperative period , probably secondary technical reason . Fundamental aspect decrease tension local ischemia gastrojejunostomy dissection tissue around pouch without devascularizing less curvature complete mobilization well-perfused Roux limb . In epidemiological , clinical experimental study , NSAID´s identify one three major risk factor PUD . Wilson et al find NSAID´s consumption significantly increase risk marginal ulcer follow RYGB ( adjust OR 11.5 , 95 % CI 4.8-28 ) . In epidemiological , clinical experimental study , Tobacco another major risk factor PUD . Smoking carry overall relative risk 2.2 ( 95 % CI , 2.0-2.3 ) . Helicobacter pylorus ( H pylorus ) infection carry overall relative risk 3.3 ( 95 % CI , 2.6-4.4 ) develop PUD . A synergistic relationship exist H pylori infection NSAID´s consumption develop PUD overall risk 3.5 ( 95 % CI , 1.26-9.96 ) compare either H pylori NSAID´s negative individual . In Papasavas et al study , preoperative H. pylorus test prophylactic eradication decrease incidence MU erosive pouch gastritis . The pathophysiological mechanism damage gastric mucosa ethanol alcoholic beverage poorly understood . There study available effect alcohol marginal ulcer development RYGB . Cocaine use responsible approximately 143,000 Emergency Department visit annually ; 19 % American , 18 25 year old , used cocaine : 1 % Americans use cocaine least week ; approximately 50 % drug-related death secondary Cocaine . The temporal association smoking cocaine ( crack ) GI tract manifestation include ulceration , perforation , visceral infarction , retroperitoneal fibrosis . Re-operative strategy address chronic marginal ulcer gastric bypass scarcely describe mostly report case small series case . The revisional strategy describe I ) ulcer excision revision gastrojejunostomy gastric transection need , II ) ulcer excision pouch downsizing redo gastrojejunostomy , III ) ulcer excision resection ischemic Roux limb segment , IV ) ulcer excision reversal . The possible adjuvant procedure include I ) proximal remnant gastrectomy ( partial gastrectomy ) , II ) vagotomy . In summary , scant information late complication gastric bypass especially widespread adoption laparoscopic approach modern anatomical construct Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery .</detailed_description>
