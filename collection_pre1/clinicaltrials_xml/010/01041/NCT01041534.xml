	<brief_summary>Our aim complete survey study patient undergone Adjustable Gastric Band ( AGB ) surgery University Washington Medical Center ( UWMC ) expand bariatric surgical site outside University Washington ( UW ) , obtain HIPAA waiver letter cooperation ) April 1 , 2007 July 1 , 2008 . ( Please note University Washington team access site 's list patient , access cod return survey send back patient ) . Patients identify obtain operative case list Department Surgery Quality Improvement Team maintain monthly record bariatric procedure perform . We obtain patient contact information ( address ) patient contact mail request complete Adjustable Gastric Band ( AGB ) Health Survey standard Quality Life survey ( EQ5D ) . The mail include Information Statement , AGB Survey , EQ5D , stamp return envelope . As incentive , $ 2 bill send along first mailing cover cost complete return survey . Patients return survey within 30 day mail second survey . Patients return second survey within 30 day mail third survey . Patients return third survey re-contacted .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While considerable energy focus cost effectiveness bariatric surgery , little systematically-gathered evidence non-surgical care healthcare expenditures similarly burden patient . The economic burden clinical impact need carefully define help guide DOD decision make regard obesity care . Understanding cost effectiveness obesity treatment also critical give cost treatment procedure , potential saving future cost related co-morbid health condition worker productivity grow population operative candidate . This study provide comprehensive assessment burden cost operative non-operative obesity care across region U.S. Department Defense ( DOD ) authorize care . The development economic assessment tool allow health policy expert , purchaser payer healthcare , clinicians patient determine utility cost-effectiveness available treatment strategy . These economic consideration relevant compete crisis spiral health care cost loss productivity relate obesity . The specific purpose study provide comprehensive assessment burden cost operative non-operative obesity care develop set economic assessment tool allow health policy expert , purchaser payer healthcare , clinicians patient determine utility cost-effectiveness available treatment strategy manage obesity . Utility refers qualitative component affect clinical condition individual 's perception quality life , ability take care one-self , ability work/be productive . We anticipate utility change greatly people able achieve weight loss , difference degree operative non-operative weight loss treatment affect utility well know . In particular , less known effect Adjustable Gastric Band ( AGB ) surgery utility emerge predominant form surgical treatment United States approximately within last five year - example , first AGB surgery UWMC perform April 2007 . In addition , assessment cost-effectiveness treatment require understand healthcare use treatment ( i.e . many follow-up visit doctor surgical treatment ) AGB require frequent follow-up visit first three year make surgical treatment effective . There little information research report actual frequency patient receive follow-up care AGB surgery , cost care ( patient cost insurance cover ) , whether frequency follow-up care affect long-term weight loss health outcome . While original procedure relate study ( IRB # 35310 , Committee E/A ) include secondary analysis exist datasets , find little information qualitative utility use/frequency follow-up care AGB patient feel important aspect model treatment choice patient consider AGB . By add survey component , capture data element otherwise find literature administrative datasets .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient undergo Adjustable gastric band ( AGB bariatric surgery ) diagnose morbid obesity include . All patient AGB bariatric operation April 1 , 2007 July 1 , 2008 include analysis except exclusionary diagnosis . Current `` Longitudinal Assessment Bariatric Surgery ( LABS ) '' study participation ( note : LABS study capture similar information utility frequency healthcare use , yet publish data could otherwise incorporate study . All LABS study site , University Washington Medical Center ( UWMC ) , prohibit duplicate research effort LABS enrol patient reduce burden patient conflict interest research reporting )</criteria>
