	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine ( FdCyd ) give together tetrahydrouridine ( THU ) treat patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . FdCyd may inhibit cancer cell growth increase production cell compound suppress growth otherwise kill cell . Although FdCyd stable drug solution , rapidly inactivate enzyme present people . THU include treatment inhibit enzyme , prolong time FdCyd remain body</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) FdCyd administer fix dose THU patient acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , daily day 1-10 21-day treatment cycle . II . To describe toxicity FdCyd/THU patient acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . III . To document clinical response hematologic improvement patient treat FdCyd/THU . IV . To obtain preliminary information regard effect FdCyd/THU deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation pattern peripheral blood mononuclear cell bone marrow aspirate , include malignant myeloid cell ; ratio gamma- beta-globin messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) blood cell ; serum cytokine . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study FdCyd . Patients receive FdCyd intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour THU IV 3 hour day 1-10 . Courses repeat every 21days absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
