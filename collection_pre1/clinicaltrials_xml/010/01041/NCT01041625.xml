	<brief_title>Pilot Study Apremilast ( CC-10004 ) Treatment Moderate Severe Lichen Planus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , single center , non-randomized , open label efficacy safety study design characterize response Apremilast 20 mg oral administer twice daily 12 week subject moderate severe lichen planus . The hypothesis ideal primary end point subject achieve significant clinical response cutaneous disease define 2 grade improvement physician global assessment ( PGA ) 12 week treatment . Many various therapy use treat LP include topical oral corticosteroid , retinoids , cyclosporine , griseofulvin , dapsone phototherapy , often disappointing response.4 It inflammatory condition whose pathogenesis involve damage basal keratinocytes alloreactive T cell release proinflammatory cytokine , TNF-α IFN-γ.1 Significantly elevate level inflammatory mediator present tissue LP lesion compare normal controls.5 Based observation , investigation Apremilast , due ability inhibit multiple inflammatory cytokine , treatment moderate severe LP warrant . The primary objective study evaluate clinical efficacy Apremilast subject moderate severe lichen planus 12 week treatment . Other objective evaluate safety tolerability Apremilast , effect quality life , efficacy mucosal disease present .</detailed_description>
