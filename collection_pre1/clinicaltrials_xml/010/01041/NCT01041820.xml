	<brief_summary>Early childhood ( ~3-7 year age ) important window determine body composition trajectory may critical period development tissue partition pattern influence obesity risk . As adiposity accelerate critical period , deposition/ preservation fat store may sustain 'expense ' tissue ; i.e . energy homeostasis may inherently bias toward fat gain . The type amount tissue mass accrue early childhood implication metabolic profile , glucose/insulin homeostasis , hormone profile rest energy expenditure . The interplay fat bone deposition represent physiologic trait enable body choose shuttle 'energy ' towards accrual particular tissue . Plausibly phenotype underlie obesity diabetes risk may determine differentiation cell type ( adipocyte , osteocyte , etc . ) early stage growth development . In vitro study demonstrate transdifferentiation influence specific external stimulus , switch phenotype toward cell lineage . Further , rodent model demonstrate exposure stimulus ( exercise ) early life may prevent excess fat mass accrual adulthood , even stimulus later remove ( animal longer exercise ) . Children 's early experience ( engagement physical activity vs. sedentary behavior ) may 'environmentally induce ' alteration body composition predispose individual obesity throughout life . Aim 1 . To examine association body composition via DXA objectively-measured physical activity/inactivity . 1 . Hypothesis 1.1 : There positive association physical activity bone mass . 2 . Hypothesis 1.2 : There positive association sedentary behavior total fat mass . Aim2 . To examine association adipose tissue distribution via MRI objectively-measured physical activity/inactivity . 3 . Hypothesis 2.1 : There inverse association physical activity bone marrow adipose tissue . 4 . Hypothesis 2.2 : There positive association sedentary behavior bone marrow adipose tissue .</brief_summary>
