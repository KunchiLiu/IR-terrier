	<detailed_description>In Italy , Professor Nicola Scopinaro , study dog , perform first BPD human 1976 . Because lack blind-loop syndrome selective malabsorption starch fat , BPD accept risk-benefit ratio compare long ago abandon Jejunoileal Bypass ( purely malabsorptive procedure ) . BPD side effect resumption full food intake include 2 4 bowel movement `` BM '' per day foul-smelling , soft stool flatulence . Modification food habit and/or administration neomycin metronidazole bacterial overgrowth syndrome tend decrease BPD side effect disappearance postcibal syndrome somewhere around fourth postoperative month . To optimize performance mainly decrease protein malnutrition incidence , BPD undergone several modification 1992 ad hoc stomach-ad hoc alimentary limb BPD configuration implement . Consequently , early sporadic late recurrent form protein malnutrition decrease high 30 % 10 % low 2.0 % 1.0 % , respectively . PROTEIN-CALORIE MALNUTRITION I ) After BPD Protein-calorie malnutrition `` PCM '' multifactorial depend patient-related factor ( eat habit , capacity adapt requirement set surgery , socio-economic status ) technical factor ( include gastric volume , bowel limb length , intestinal absorption adaptation , amount endogenous nitrogen loss ) . Most case limit single sporadic episode . In early postoperative period secondary force reduce food intake , marasmic form PCM incidence high , aim operation . However , carbohydrate intake prefer ( poor compliance adequate protein intake ) , hypoalbuminemic form develop . The absorptive capacity alimentary limb `` AL '' common limb channel `` CC '' depend 1 ) number villus per square centimeter , 2 ) transit time , 3 ) total intestinal length AL + CC . Thus , condition interferes postoperative intestinal adaptation , mainly villous hypertrophy ; increase transit time ; and/or decrease length functional AL + CC lead late onset severe PCM . Increased number bowel movement `` BM '' severe diarrhea generally precede PCM . After adequate counsel life-style change ( mainly consumption 90 g/day high biological value protein ) , supplementation pancreatic enzyme , management contribute medical condition ( gastroenteritis , lactose intolerance , intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome , celiac sprue , inflammatory bowel disease ) , recurrent severe PCM frequently cause excessive malabsorption . When mild moderate protein malnutrition instated , two three week parenteral nutrition generally require revert . In contrast , severe PCM refers need prolonged total parenteral nutrition `` TPN '' , recurrent need TPN , malnutrition recalcitrant TPN . Eventually , revisional surgery require . The recurrent severe form PM rarely secondary excessive persistence food limitation mechanism without poor protein intake , require restitution intestinal continuity complete reconstruction gastrointestinal tract ( partial vs. full restoration ) . The partial restoration gastrointestinal tract allow normal protein-energy absorption , still partially preserve specific effect BPD glucose cholesterol metabolism . II ) After RYGB 1 . Over seven-year period , Avinoah et al . report nutritional status 200 RYGB patient . Meat intolerance observe 51 % , 60.3 % , 59.5 % 55.1 % patient 1st year , 2nd year , 3rd 6th year , 7th year RYGB , respectively . No protein-calorie malnutrition identify . 2 . Moize et al . evaluate food consumption 93 RYGB patient find inadequate protein intake related protein intolerance one year . Protein intake increase significantly first postoperative year 45 g 3 month , 46 g 6 month , 58 g 12 month . Low protein intake along first year RYGB mainly relate intolerance rich-protein food animal protein , mainly red meat . 3 . There study quantify protein malabsorption short-limb RYGB kind RYGB variant . However , less acidic environment gastric pouch RYGB delay protein digestion affect release cascade peptide enzymes , include pepsinogen , gastrin , cholecystokinin involve initial breakdown protein . 4 . In 236 consecutive short-limb , ( 6.3cm ) band RYGB patient , Faintuch et al . identify 4.7 % patient severe hypoalbuminemic malnutrition 63.6 % defined event , stenosis gastrojejunostomy ( 36.4 % ) associate disease , 36.4 % severe emesis without endoscopic abnormality . 5 . In series 342 consecutive ring RYGB , White et al . report 2 % ring removal rate place 6.5cm ring 92 patient major restriction solid food . 6 . In 65 patient convert distal RYGB , Fobi et al . report mean BMI decrease 7 kg/m2 ; however , 23 % patient develop protein malnutrition require revision surgery almost 50 % . 7 . In 27 distal RYGB 3rd postoperative year , Sugerman et al . report 25 % incidence protein malnutrition 150-cm common channel RYGB ( n=22 ) . In contrast , five patient 50-cm common channel need elongation common channel two die hepatic failure . After extensive review literature , Kushner list principal variable contribute nutritional deterioration bariatric surgery : 1 ) sever malabsorption malabsorptive procedure BPD BPD-DS distal , long-limb RYGB ; 2 ) surgical mechanical complication , stenosis gastrojejunostomy , intractable marginal ulcer , gastro-gastric fistula ; 3 ) Non-compliance Same analysis review literature available less extensive Metabolic bone disease , Anemia ( Iron , folate , vitamin B12 ) , liposoluble vitamin essential fatty acid . Revisional strategy : Revisional strategy describe long-term complication BPD 1 ) elongation common limb channel , 2 ) restoration intestinal continuity ( partial restoration ) , 3 ) restoration gastrointestinal continuity ( full restoration ) . RYGB vs. BPD : Roux-en-Y configuration 1 . Weight maintenance BPD BPD-DS appear superior restrictive procedure RYGB . However , never subject randomize control trial . 2 . Intuitively , one would expect macro micronutrient deficiency bariatric surgery frequent severe primarily malabsorptive restriction pure malabsorptive procedure carry , show correct ( level evidence 3 C ) . 3 . Comparing incidence rate large series perform expert , incidence rate late metabolic/nutritional complication standard BPD/BPD-DS high standard RYGB . 4 . There trial level evidence 3 &amp; 4 ( C &amp; D ) favor overall superiority RYGB BPD clinically severe obesity include among others follow : - RYGB around longer BPD - Widespread use RYGB compare BPD - Comparable weight loss however BPD good weight maintenance RYGB - RYGB low morbidity mortality BPD include metabolic/nutritional problem , prevalent BPD RYGB . - RYGB , general , accept best revisional strategy failed/ complicate restrictive procedure even malabsortive surgery jejunoileal bypass Summarizing , evidence level A 1 best overall primary bariatric procedure address obesity long-term . In USA , investigator prefer RYGB primary bariatric procedure , leave BPD BPD-DS select case include revisionary surgery poor weight loss . After RYGB BPD/BPD-DS , patient require give priority protein intake macronutrients well vitamin mineral supplementation lifelong ; objective standardize recommendation supplementation . However , metabolic/nutritional complication BPD BPD-DS develop regardless optimize multispecialty medical management , lengthen common channel partial full reversal describe . On hand , one-stage revision , either open laparoscopic , BPD standard RYGB never report . With study , advance knowledge revisional RYGB , metabolic complication hybrid bariatric procedure , along exist literature , draw preliminary clinical recommendation .</detailed_description>
