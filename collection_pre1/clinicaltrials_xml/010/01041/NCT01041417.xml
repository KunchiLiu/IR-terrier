	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease common condition old adult involve poor arterial circulation leg lead leg pain debility . The body 's circulate blood vessel stem cell may help improve circulation . This study test whether treatment drug granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) improve symptom sign peripheral arterial disease placebo four week therapy . As well study examine whether improvement blood vessel function observe . Finally , measure blood vessel function stem cell level order determine whether help predict whether patient wither peripheral arterial disease suffer cardiovascular complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) affect 8 million Americans . Although exercise , smoke cessation , anti-platelet therapy , cilostazol , statins revascularization use treat PAD , men woman PAD significantly great functional impairment fasterfunctional decline without PAD . Stem progenitor cell ( PC ) therapy promote neoangiogenesis emerge treatment modality PAD . Progenitor cell , particularly endothelial origin , involve vascular repair regeneration . They originate primarily exclusively bone marrow , differentiate endothelial vascular cell , contribute neovascularization tissue repair direct paracrine mechanism . Endogenous , pharmacologically-stimulated , exogenous PCs contribute re-endothelialization neovascularization . Granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) stimulate mobilization hematopoietic PCs bone marrow.In murine hind limb ischemia model , GM-CSF administer injection plasmid transfer augments circulate level PCs , increase capillary density , promote arteriogenesis.GM-CSF also augment neo-endothelialization denuded artery , promote proliferation , differentiation survival hematopoietic cell , monocyte macrophage .</detailed_description>
