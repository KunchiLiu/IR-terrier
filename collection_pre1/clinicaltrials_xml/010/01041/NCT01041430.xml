On POD 14 patient question unplanned contact primary healthcare , unplanned hospital visit , readmission , correspond reason . Patient satisfaction treatment operate room follow arrival postanaesthesia care unit evaluate numerically ( 0-10 ) , use numeric rating scale ( NRS ) , 0 indicate low , 10 high possible satisfaction rat patient . Intensity postoperative pain evaluate NRS . Overall condition functional capacity evaluate use 3 -point scale ( good / moderate / poor ) . Health-related quality life measure use RAND-36-instrument . Patients inquire degree impairment groin area preoperative visit , three month postoperatively . Results give median ( range ) mean ( SD ) appropriate . Patient characteristic surgery -related variable NRS score compare use Chi-square , Mann-Whitney-U Kruskall-Wallis test appropriate . Intergroup comparison perform use Wilcoxon test relate sample .
