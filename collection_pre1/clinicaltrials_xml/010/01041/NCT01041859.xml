	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability orally administer tapentadol extend release ( ER ) dosages 100 250 mg twice daily compare placebo patient moderate severe pain due chronic , painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) tolerate tapentadol ( ER ) initial treatment effect ( pain improvement ) 3-week , open-label titration period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability Tapentadol ER Compared With Placebo Patients With Chronic , Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized-withdrawal ( patient initial response tapentadol assign either tapentadol placebo ) , placebo-controlled , multicenter study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability orally administer tapentadol , use extended release tamper-resistant formulation ( TRF ) , dosages 100 250 mg twice daily patient moderate severe pain due chronic , painful DPN . The study consist 1 ) open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) phase , include 13-day screening period , 5-day washout period ( patient stop take pain medication ) , 3-day pre-titration pain-intensity evaluation period ( patient record pain intensity twice daily morning evening ) , 3-week , open-label titration period ( patient receive tapentadol study drug ) , 2 ) 12-week , double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign drug ) maintenance phase , 3 ) posttreatment phase approximately 10 14 day . The study evaluate effectiveness orally administer tapentadol ER versus placebo reduce patient ' pain intensity . The pain intensity assess compare baseline pain level level week 12 maintenance phase . The total duration study drug treatment patient approximately 15 week . Safety tolerability evaluate vital sign , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , standardize neurologic examination , monitor adverse event . Patients titrate tapentadol ER start dose 50 mg twice daily patient 's optimal dose range 100 mg 250 mg twice day , placebo . All dos study medication take orally approximately 120 ml water without food maximum timeframe 15 week .</detailed_description>
