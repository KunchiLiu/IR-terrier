	<brief_summary>A one-arm , open , multi-center study , evaluate sorafenib ( 400mg twice daily ) adjuvant prevent recurrence RCC ( renal cell carcinoma ) patient radical nephrectomy high-risk recur . To observe disease-free survival survival rate 3 years,5 year . The purpose study : - To study efficacy Sorafenib adjuvant therapy reduce recurrence rate locally advance renal-cell carcinoma ( RCC ) radical nephrectomy . - To observe incidence hand-foot skin reaction ( HFSR ) Urea ( 10 % 5 % ) base cream intervention treatment . The primary end point disease-free survival ( DFS ) .The secondary end point overall survival ( OS ) , drug safety tolerance , occurrence hand foot skin reaction ( HFSR ) week 3,6,12 , skin toxicity ( include HFSR ) high CTCAE ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) Grade 2 12th week , incidence HFSR Urea ( 10 % 5 % ) base cream intervention treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A one-arm , open , multi-center study , evaluate sorafenib ( 400mg twice daily ) adjuvant prevent recurrence RCC ( renal cell carcinoma ) patient radical nephrectomy high-risk recur . To observe disease-free survival survival rate 3 year , 5 year . To observe incidence hand-foot skin reaction ( HFSR ) Urea ( 10 % 5 % ) base cream intervention treatment . 140 subject prospect enter trial . The sorafenib adjuvant therapy unremitting time 12 month . For convenient record , every 6 week regard single observational cycle . The end-point recurrence , tolerant toxicity , need stop intervene study withdraw informed consent . It necessary evaluate efficacy safety every 6 week . At screen stage every 12 week image review perform abdominal chest CT MRI , image method single subject uniformity trial . The post-treatment evaluation perform 30 day last usage adjuvant order collect adverse event ( AE ) survival rate subject . The agent-relevant AE ( know unknown ) report drug safety institution , patient visit event solve , except event solved subject ' underlying disease .</detailed_description>
