	<brief_summary>A key factor determination body composition lifecourse fat accumulation childhood . Periods life associate great change organ development growth , i.e . early childhood , significant effect body composition , energy balance , metabolism . Early childhood ( age 3 7 year ) represent critical transition basis adaptability body composition , due rapid growth development occur . Plausibly phenotype underlie obesity relate health risk may determine body composition critical period . Our previous research child consistently indicate HA child accumulate great amount fat , particularly intra-abdominal compartment , even similar BMI , low bone mineral content relative EA child . The reason difference body composition lifecourse clear . Racial/ethnic difference risk factor health , include 'thriftiness ' body fat accumulation often evident age 7 , suggest racial/ethnic difference energy utilization subsequent fat storage may account genetic make-up , environment ( e.g . diet ) , interaction two . The physiologic behavioral process ( e ) cause ( ) certain child take trajectory towards obesity others accrue less fat known . However , economic decision fuel utilization physiologic trait enable body choose shuttle 'energy ' towards accrual particular tissue ( e.g . bone vs. fat ) trait likely genetic component . This genetic component may embed fat storage capacity evolve gene environment interaction promote thrift , particularly conserve population . Although genetic background play role , know whether relationship genetic background , know candidate gene candidate pathway environmental contributor ( e.g . diet ) impact body composition trajectory . Of central importance understand early fat mass accumulation health disparity mechanisms lead chronic disease progression . It likely variation within candidate gene may differential impact individual base genetic background . It also probable body composition influence many gene , often within metabolic pathway , small individual effect . These gene may significantly associate individually , examine unit ( candidate pathway gene-gene interaction framework ) association become significant . Further , child 's early environmental exposure ( e.g . diet ) may interact genetic background variation candidate gene along result alteration body composition predispose HA excess fat accumulation throughout lifecourse . To end , follow specific aim evaluate : Aim 1 . To examine association genetic admixture body composition child age 3-7 year control dietary intake . 1 . Hypothesis 1.1 : There direct association Amerindian admixture fat mass inverse association Amerindian admixture bone mass . 2 . Hypothesis 1.2 : There direct association energy intake fat accumulation relationship particularly evident individual great proportion Amerindian admixture . Aim 2 . To examine association genetic admixture bone marrow fat child age 3-7 year control dietary intake . 1 . Hypothesis 2.1 : There direct association Amerindian admixture bone marrow fat . 2 . Hypothesis 2.2 : There direct association energy intake fat accumulation bone marrow relationship particularly evident individual great proportion Amerindian admixture . Aim 3 . To examine relationship variation candidate gene pathway Amerindian admixture control dietary intake . a. Hypothesis 3.1 : Amerindian admixture associate variation candidate gene pathway know associated fat accumulation .</brief_summary>
