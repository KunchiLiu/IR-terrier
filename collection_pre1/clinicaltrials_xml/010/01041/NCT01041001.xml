	<brief_title>Study Compare Efficacy Safety Cartistem® Microfracture Patients With Knee Articular Cartilage Injury Defect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cartilage unique avascular , aneural tissue regenerate easily damage . Chondral defect damage articular cartilage due accident , necrosis subchondral bone tissue , arthritis become common disorder today . About 15 % world 's population reportedly suffer cartilage joint damage degenerative arthritis rheumatoid arthritis . As population age progress young people start take active sport , size target patient group also grow . However , despite ongoing research , effective treatment cartilage defect yet discover . Various different type treatment currently use , drug therapy , arthroscopy , artificial joint surgery . However , fail address root cause . Complete treatment , regeneration damage defective cartilage impossible continuous drug administration secondary surgery require many case . As way regenerate damage defective cartilage tissue , treatment localized damage articular cartilage use autologous chondrocytes currently review . A life science company home abroad market method treatment call 'autologous chondrocyte transplant ' . The treatment involve extraction healthy cartilage tissue patient culture transplant damage site . However , treatment require extraction chondrocytes directly patient thus cause trauma healthy articular cartilage . Also , type treatment apply large lesion , efficacy satisfactory patient age 40 whose cellular activation level low . Thus , autologous chondrocyte transplant rather limited number cell harvest activation level therefore restrict term treatment site , severity condition , size lesion . The current technology allow application treatment local cartilage defect degenerative arthritis rheumatoid arthritis . The technology need take another level order benefit prevalent arthritic disorder . Treatments use stem cell cause damage healthy articular cartilage n't require harvest healthy cartilage tissue patient . Moreover , number successfully culture cell large due excellent proliferation capability stem cell thus , mass supply possible . This clinical trial stem cell therapies essential treatment cartilage defect umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell , know high level activity among adult stem cell , open possibility articular cartilage regeneration even age patient patient large lesion unable benefit exist treatment . The big challenge face nation compete field `` tissue differentiation regeneration use stem cell '' question whether use embryonic stem cell ethical . Chondrogenesis use umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell avoid similar challenge , also present innovative treatment mode significant clinical implication patient . In clinical study , mesenchymal stem cell isolated umbilical cord blood culture , mixed semi- solid polymer , administer cartilage tissue lesion orthopedic surgery order stimulate regeneration defective cartilage tissue improve function .</detailed_description>
