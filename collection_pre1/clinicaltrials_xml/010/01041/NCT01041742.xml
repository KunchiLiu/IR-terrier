	<brief_title>Pulse Pressure Variation ( PPV ) Predict Fluid Responsiveness During Cardiac Displacement Patients Undergoing Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( OPCAB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate ability PPV predict fluid responsiveness displacement heart patient undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery . After anesthesia , measure mean arterial pressure , heart rate , central venous pressure , mean pulmonary artery pressure , pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure , mixed venous oxygen saturation , PPV cardiac index patient receive elective OPCAB . All parameter record 5 minute leave anterior descend artery anastomosis , immediately displacement heart leave circumflex artery anastomosis , 10 minute fluid load hydroxyethyl starch 6 % ( 10 mL/kg ) . Patients whose cardiac index increase &gt; 15 % fluid loading define responder . To test ability central venous pressure , pulmonary artery occlusion pressure PPV predict fluid responsiveness heart displacement , area receiver operate characteristic curve responder calculate compare .</detailed_description>
