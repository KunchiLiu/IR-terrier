	<detailed_description>The epidemic overweight obesity United States America along comorbidities continue expand . Bariatric surgery demonstrate effective sustained method control severe obesity comorbidities . For instance , type 2 diabetes mellitus completely resolve 76.8 % , systemic arterial hypertension resolve 61.7 % , dyslipidemia improve 70 % obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome resolve 85.7 % . Furthermore , bariatric surgery significantly increase life expectancy ( 89 % ) decrease overall mortality ( 30-40 % ) , particularly deaths diabetes , heart disease , cancer . Lastly , preliminary evidence downstream saving associate bariatric surgery offset initial cost 2 4 year . Since 2000 , substantially progressive increase bariatric surgery . In 2007 , ASMBS report 205,000 people bariatric surgery United States approximately 80 % Gastric Bypass . Moreover , mismatch eligibility receipt bariatric surgery le 1 % eligible population treat morbid obesity bariatric surgery . Along increase number elective primary weight loss procedure , 20 % post RYGB patient sustain weight loss beyond 2 3 year primary bariatric procedure . Thus , revisional surgery poor weight loss re-operations technical mechanical complication rise parallel manner . A common late complication gastric bypass surgery marginal ulceration define ulcer margin gastrojejunostomy , mostly jejunal side . Its incidence RYGB range low 0.6 high 16 % . After 1,040 laparoscopic RYGB surgery , incidence rate , hand , 1.4 % mainly related NSAID´s use . In observational cohort study , presence specific technical factor - staple-line dehiscence gastro-gastric fistula , enlarge pouch , foreign material local ischemia - environmental factor - tobacco , NSAID´s , alcohol consumption , H pylori infection among others - associate marginal ulceration however exact etiopathogenesis completely elucidate . Similar peptic ulcer disease , marginal ulcer respond medical therapy complicate complex ulcer disease warrant operative intervention . Specifically , perforate , penetrate , obstruct , bleed intractable marginal ulcer require surgical intervention . The intestinal mucosa typically expose gastric acid , neutralized alkaline biliopancreatic secretion . The jejunal mucosa natural barrier ; expose gastric acid , ulcerate easily . Capella &amp; Capella demonstrate transect gastric segment significantly reduce staple-line dehiscence ; so-called divide gastric bypass . The incidence gastro-gastric fistula ( GGF ) formation undivided gastric bypass ( GBP ) 23 % , partially divide GBP 19 % , completely divide GBP 2 % complete transection interposition jejunal limb 0 % ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . An unusually large gastric pouch ( horizontal pouch , retain fundus , long less curvature base pouch enlarge initially size adequately ) contain acid-producing parietal cell . Increased acid production pouch carry risk develop marginal ulcer . Acid secretion small pouch RYGB virtually absent . The anastomotic technique influence incidence marginal ulcer . Capella &amp; Capella report consecutive series significant decrement 5.1 % 1.5 % ( p &lt; 0.001 ) switch staple hand-sewn anastomosis . Likewise , change inner layer absorbable suture outer layer nonabsorbable material double-layer absorbable suture incidence rate improve 1.6 % 0 % . Local ischemia , immediate postoperative period , probably secondary technical reason . Fundamental aspect decrease tension local ischemia gastrojejunostomy dissection tissue around pouch without devascularizing less curvature complete mobilization well-perfused Roux limb . NSAID´s inhibit prostaglandin synthesis 1 ) decreasing blood flow mucosa ( mainly PG subgroups E I , promote vasodilatation ) , 2 ) increase adherence neutrophil , 3 ) topical irritant effect , 4 ) impair repair/healing process , 5 ) gastric-acid-related effect . In retrospective cohort study , Wilson et al find NSAID´s consumption correlate marginal ulcer development RYGB . Numerous study identify NSAID´s use main risk factor PUD ; however , precise relevance NSAID´s factor marginal ulcer development RYGB largely unknown . In epidemiological , clinical experimental study , Tobacco identify major risk factor peptic ulcer disease ( PUD ) . Smoking carry overall relative risk 2.2 develop PUD . A synergistic relationship develop PUD exist H pylori infection smoking ( 2.3 vs. 6.1 ) . Biological evidence suggest smoke compromise gastric mucosa barrier , decrease gastric empty increase gastric secretion . For marginal ulcer RYGB , three cohort study show positive correlation smoke develop anastomotic ulcer . Helicobacter pylorus ( H pylorus ) infection carry overall relative risk 3.3 ( 95 % CI , 2.6-4.4 ) develop PUD . A synergistic relationship exist H pylori infection NSAID´s consumption develop PUD overall risk 3.5 ( 95 % CI , 1.26-9.96 ) compare either H pylori NSAID´s negative individual . Furthermore , 61.1 ( 95 % CI , 9.98-373 ) overall risk exist compare H pylori negative individual take NSAID´s . For marginal ulcer RYGB , three cohort study show H. pylori infection associate development marginal ulcer . In Papasavas et al study , preoperative H. pylorus test prophylactic eradication decrease incidence MU erosive pouch gastritis . The pathophysiological mechanism damage gastric mucosa Ethanol alcoholic beverage poorly understood . There scant retrospective epidemiological study determine relationship alcohol consumption PUD exist . Although alcohol associate increase risk PUD , patient PUD advise avoid alcoholic drink . Basic science study show instillation pure ethanol low concentration ( 4-40 % v/v ) cause hemorrhagic gastritis dose-dependant fashion . Also synergistic relationship exist ethanol NSAID´s , since cause mucosal injury . On hand , study available effect alcohol marginal ulcer development RYGB . Cocaine use responsible approximately 143,000 Emergency Department visit annually ; 19 % American , 18 25 year old , used cocaine : 1 % Americans use cocaine least week ; approximately 50 % drug-related death secondary Cocaine . The temporal association smoking cocaine ( crack ) GI tract manifestation include ulceration , perforation , visceral infarction , retroperitoneal fibrosis . Most ulcer perforation juxtapyloric duodenal ( D1 ) however jejunal location report . The physiopathologic hypothesis include follow mechanism 1 ) cocaine block re-uptake norepinephrine lead intense vasoconstriction ( alpha-adrenergic receptor ) , mesenteric ischemia , focal tissue ischemia , coagulative necrosis perforation ; 2 ) cocaine cause thrombus formation platelet aggregation mediate endogenous Thromboxane B2 . A retrospective cohort study suggest primary patch repair recommend therapeutic option type ulcer . However , Shuster et al report high recurrence rate ( 42 % ) omental patch repair compare definitive anti-ulcer procedure ( 0 % ) . Little information exist association crack gastroduodenal ulcer perforation temporal association report small retrospective cohort study . In communication , Dr Mason recall two patient perforate `` stomach ulcer '' associate cocaine use . The following Critically-Ill patient significant increase risk stress-related mucosal disease ( SRMD ) : 1 ) mechanical ventilation &gt; 48hrs conveys 16-fold risk ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , 2 ) coagulopathy 4-fold risk ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , 3 ) shock carry 3.7-fold risk ( p= 0.08 ) , 4 ) drop intramural pH ( 8 6 , 5 ) , 5 ) increase number risk factor ( 0 4 ) , 6 ) recent major surgery , 7 ) major trauma , 8 ) severe burn , 9 ) head trauma , 10 ) hepatic renal disease admission , 11 ) sepsis . SRMD encompass stress-related injury ( SRI ) , primarily erosion GI tract , stress ulcer , focal deep mucosal damage . The pathogenesis SRMD unravel completely strong evidence hypoperfusion reperfusion upper GI tract major cause . There literature available marginal ulcer RYGB associate ICU critically ill patient . Diverse operative strategy address perforate marginal ulcer gastric bypass describe include I ) Omental ( Graham ) patch repair , II ) Revision gastrojejunostomy , III ) Irrigation drainage , IV ) previous procedure truncal vagotomy , V ) Esophagojejunostomy , VI ) Reversal . Summarizing , scant information late complication gastric bypass especially widespread adoption laparoscopic approach modern anatomical construct Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery .</detailed_description>
