	<brief_title>A New Oxygen Mask Carotid Endarterectomy Under Local Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) procedure remove plaque carotid artery ( one two main artery supply blood brain ) . The procedure effective reducing risk subsequent stroke . To access artery , incision make artery wall mean artery must clamp order prevent blood loss . Consequently , blood supply ( therefore oxygen supply ) brain reduce . To ensure patient sufficient oxygen avoid brain damage , procedure often carry local anaesthetic mean anaesthetist talk operation ; mean determine patient 's conscious level whether need supplementary oxygen . There various way administer supplementary oxygen . Most oxygen mask completely cover mouth nose inevitably limit patient-doctor communication . Oxygen therefore usually administer via nasal tube . However , actual level oxygen take patient hard measure , best 40 % . A novel mask open design . By create 'vortex ' oxygen deliver high concentration oxygen patient without significantly interfere doctor-patient communication , time , improve patient comfort . We wish test efficacy mask CEA plan measure oxygen content blood directly use blood sample ; also monitor marker brain damage may occur lack oxygen . Finally , survey patient acceptability mask .</detailed_description>
