	<brief_title>Letrozole Treating Breast Cancer Postmenopausal Women With Stage I , II , III Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Tamoxifen ( GIM4 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare disease-free survival previously treat , post-menopausal woman early-stage breast cancer treat standard- ( 2-3 year tamoxifen follow 2-3 year letrozole ) versus long-treatment ( 2-3 year tamoxifen follow 5 year letrozole ) adjuvant letrozole . Secondary - To compare overall survival patient . - To compare safety patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( standard treatment ) : Patients previously treat tamoxifen 2 year receive letrozole additional 3 year ; patient previously treat tamoxifen 3 year receive letrozole additional 2 year ; patient previously treat tamoxifen 2-3 year receive letrozole , total duration endocrine treatment ( i.e. , tamoxifen follow letrozole ) 5 year . - Arm II ( long treatment ) : Patients receive letrozole additional 5 year regardless duration previous tamoxifen treatment .</detailed_description>
