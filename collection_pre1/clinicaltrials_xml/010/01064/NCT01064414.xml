	<brief_title>An Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability Study Canagliflozin Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Who Have Moderate Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double blind ( neither patient study doctor know name assign treatment ) , parallel-group , 3-arm ( patient assign 1 3 treatment group ) multicenter study determine efficacy , safety , tolerability 2 different dos canagliflozin ( 100 mg 300 mg ) compare placebo ( pill look like treatment real medicine ) patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) renal impairment ( reduce kidney function ) achieve adequate response current therapy control diabetes . Canagliflozin ( also refer JNJ-28431754 ) drug test see may useful treat patient diagnosed T2DM . Approximately 240 patient participate study approximately 63 72 week , depend length pretreatment phase . The study consist pretreatment phase , 52 week double blind treatment phase , posttreatment phase . During pretreatment phase , screen evaluation perform see patient meet entry criterion study . In addition , routine clinical procedure perform ( physical examination , vital sign measurement , electrocardiogram [ ECG ] ) , blood urine sample collect routine clinical laboratory test , antihyperglycemic therapy take patient review . Patients meet entrance criterion study currently take stable antihyperglycemic agent ( AHA ) regimen accord local prescribing information eligible inclusion study . Patients meet entrance criterion study take stable AHA regimen accord local prescribing information enter AHA adjustment period may last 12 week . Patients receive daily treatment study drug addition current stable diabetes regimen ( eg , diet , exercise , medication therapy ) . Patients continue take assign treatment 52 week ( include 26-week core double-blind treatment period 26-week extension double-blind treatment period ) . During study , patient 's blood sugar remain high despite treatment study drug combination antidiabetic agent , study physician modify patient 's treatment . If patient take insulin experience low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) , dose insulin may modify . During study , patient monitor safety review adverse event , result safety laboratory test ( include chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , ECGs , vital sign measurement , body weight , physical examination , self-monitored blood glucose , collection potential hypoglycemic episode report patient diary card . The safety patient study also monitor company internal Medical Safety Review Committee ( MSRC ) . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) evaluate cardiovascular ( CV ) event report across entire clinical development program canagliflozin . Patients complete Week 52 visit discontinue treatment early withdrawn study end-of-study evaluation perform follow-up telephone interview conduct study personnel approximately 30 day ( 42 day ) last dose study drug collect serious adverse event occur since last study visit . The primary outcome measure study assess effect canagliflozin relative placebo hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c , blood test use measure control diabetes ) 26 week treatment assess safety tolerability canagliflozin time sign informed consent study end ( include 30 day follow last dose study drug ) . All patient take single-blind placebo capsule daily 2 week randomization double-blind study drug . After randomization , patient take one capsule canagliflozin ( either 100 mg 300 mg ) match placebo orally ( mouth ) liquid daily 52 week first meal day except day fast pharmacokinetic blood sample collect case study drug take visit immediately patient 's next meal .</detailed_description>
