	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Giving vorinostat together chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient stage III stage IVa squamous cell cancer oropharynx either unresectable borderline resectable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose Vorinostat combination concurrent chemoradiotherapy treatment advance stage OPSCC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : l. To determine complete response rate , overall survival progression free survival use maximally tolerate dose Vorinostat . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess treatment related acute late toxicity combine Vorinostat chemoradiation correlate toxicity molecular marker apoptosis tumor normal oral mucosa . II . To evaluate effect Vorinostat tumor immune surveillance , particularly HPV positive patient . III . To illustrate Vorinostat alters methylation status commonly methylated gene OPSCC . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients receive oral vorinostat day 0-2 cisplatin IV day 7 , 21 , 35 . Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 day week begin day 7 . Patients also receive concurrent oral vorinostat along radiotherapy give 3 day per week ( Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday ) . Treatment continue 7 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
