	<brief_summary>Brittle nail syndrome ( BNS ) refers nails exhibit splitting , raggedness ( fray distal edge ) , peel ( lamellar onychoschizia ) . ( 1 ) This common problem , affect approximately 20 % woman , high prevalence among elderly . ( 2 ) A number factor propose possible cause nail brittleness , anemia , biotin deficiency , cysteine deficiency . ( 3,4 ) However , author believe brittle nail usually cause dehydration nail plate , either repetitive cycle hydration dehydration relate hand wash exposure dehydrate chemical , find nail enamel cuticle remover . ( 5,6 ) Inflammation nail potential contributing factor never study . There currently consistently effective treatment condition . Restasis® effective treat keratoconjunctivitis sicca . This condition characterize troublesome condition dry eye partially due decrease tear production exacerbate inflammation . The BNS manifest nail plate dehydration . The two condition common disruption water balance give rise problematic clinical disorder . The hypothesis product benefit tear production would also effective brittle nail contain roughly 15 % water .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Brittle nail syndrome ( BNS ) heterogeneous abnormality , characterize increase fragility nail plate . About 20 % population affect brittle nails woman affect twice frequently men . ( 2 ) . The diagnostic criterion brittle nails well define author agree least 3 criterion : onychoschizia ( lamellar splitting free edge distal portion nail plate ) , onychorrhexis ( longitudinal thickening thin ridge nail plate ) fray raggedness distal edge cause transverse splitting . Although cause nail brittleness unknown , author believe cause dehydration nail plate frequent cycle hydration dehydration well various mechanical chemical insult increase incidence brittle nail . ( 7 ) The nail plate contain 15 % water low lipid content water permeation nail plate high . ( 8 ) In fact , demonstrate flux water across nail plate 10 time epidermis 1000 time permeable stratum corneum . ( 9 ) A recent report show significant difference water content brittle nail compare normal nail suggest nail plate water content random nail plate constant state influx efflux water . ( 10 ) Keratoconjunctivitis sicca chronic , bilateral desiccation conjunctiva cornea due inadequate tear film . There two type : one cause inadequate tear volume one cause accelerate tear evaporation due poor tear quality ( 11 ) . Restasis® ( cyclosporine 0.05 % topical emulsion ) effective treat keratoconjunctivitis sicca . BNS keratoconjunctivitis sicca common disruption water balance give rise problematic clinical disorder . We hypothesize product improve corneal dehydration would also effective brittle nail . Our rationale use occlusion show occlude skin vapor-permeable membrane increase water flux barrier function recover normal rate . ( 12 ) We also hypothesize use Restasis® ( cyclosporine 0.05 % topical emulsion ) vehicle ( Refresh Dry Eye Therapy® ) occlusion finger cot increase nail plate hydration balance consequence improve nail brittleness . Topical cyclosporine show safe treatment dermatological condition nail psoriasis oral lichen planus . ( 13,14 ) An investigator-blinded design differentiate observe effect cause active ingredient Restasis® ( cyclosporine 0.05 % topical emulsion ) vehicle ( Refresh Dry Eye Therapy® ) .</detailed_description>
