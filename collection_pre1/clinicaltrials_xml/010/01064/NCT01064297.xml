	<brief_summary>Antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) indicate use pregnancy . However , woman epilepsy , approve indication include bipolar disorder , may require unintentionally expose AEDs pregnancy . Prior AED market data available drug safety pregnancy : data animal model may translate directly human pregnant woman routinely exclude clinical trial . The International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry establish GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) 1992 monitor safety lamotrigine pregnancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry ( LAM05 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry aim ass whether substantial increase risk major congenital malformation ( MCMs ) follow utero exposure lamotrigine . Exposure first trimester primary interest represent period organogenesis . The Registry primarily prospective enrolment follow-up study . Patients expose lamotrigine pregnancy enrol , voluntary basis , healthcare provider . Enrolment encourage early pregnancy possible prior prenatal testing . The healthcare provider provide initial information concern patient demographic ; detail pregnancy include estimate delivery date result prenatal test ; timing , duration dosage lamotrigine exposure pregnancy . The registry accept exposure report anywhere world . Within United States ( US ) healthcare provider contact registry use toll free number . Outside US enrolment make GlaxoSmithKline local operating company . Close estimated date delivery healthcare provider contact Registry provide follow information concern pregnancy outcome ( live still birth , spontaneous induced abortion ) , presence absence MCM , history exposure lamotrigine well antiepileptic antipsychotic pregnancy . Up six attempt make contact healthcare provider obtain pregnancy outcome information . After six attempt , record close lose follow . Pregnancy outcomes classify outcome MCMs , outcomes without MCMs spontaneous abortion . The outcome without MCMs classify live birth , stillbirths/fetal death induce abortion . Spontaneous abortion report separately due potential inconsistent identification malformation situation . It beyond scope Registry consistently access pediatric evaluation medical record . For reason main outcome restrict major congenital malformation external recognizable delivery room shortly birth . To provide consistency , report congenital malformation classify major minor accord criterion use Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) 's Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) . All malformation report review classified paediatrician CDC information request necessary . Analyses restrict prospectively enrolled pregnancy ( enrolment prior knowledge birth outcome ) . Retrospectively enrolled pregnancy review pattern defect type , include formal analysis retrospective report bias towards unusual severe outcomes less likely representative general population experience . The proportion infant MCMs among prospectively report exposure calculate : total number outcome major birth defect ( number outcomes major birth defect + number live birth without defect ) . Chromosomal malformation report descriptively , include numerator unlikely associate drug exposure pregnancy . All spontaneous pregnancy loss , well induced abortion fetal death without report defect , exclude denominator due potential inconsistent identification malformation situation . The 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) risk estimate calculate use exact method base binomial distribution . Analyses stratify accord trimester exposure ( second trimester start week 14 third trimester week 28 gestation ) exposure group ( lamotrigine monotherapy , lamotrigine polytherapy include valproate lamotrigine polytherapy without valproate ) . The registry internal comparator group , descriptive comparison make MCM rate general population study literature ongoing AED pregnancy registry . Prospective report also review detect unusual pattern malformation type may warrant investigation . The data International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry review , conclusion develop , independent scientific advisory committee . A semi-annual interim report summarize aggregate data provide disseminate information regular basis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women expose utero lamotrigine ( monotherapy polytherapy combination ) pregnancy . Exposure occur time pregnancy , though exposure first trimester primary interest . Pregnancies expose lamotrigine report outcome pregnancy know ( prospective reporting ) . Ideally exposed pregnancy register prior prenatal testing , pregnancy enrol prenatal testing diagnose birth defect exclude . Retrospectively report exposure ( i.e . exposure register pregnancy outcome know ) include registry , consider descriptively include risk analysis . Retrospectively report exposure ( i.e . exposure register pregnancy outcome know ) include registry , review separately descriptively . These include risk analysis . Patient report exposure outcome verify healthcare provider .</criteria>
