	<brief_summary>This randomise , double-blind , cross-over study pazopanib versus sunitinib patient locally advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) receive prior systemic therapy advance metastatic RCC . Approximately 160 eligible patient stratify base ECOG performance status ( 0 vs. 1 ) number metastatic site disease ( 0 1 vs. &gt; =2 ) . The study consist two treatment period 10 week 2-week wash-out period two treatment period . Patients receive pazopanib sunitinib treatment sequentially double-blinded fashion . The primary objective study assess tolerability safety difference pazopanib sunitinib translate patient preference , define patient 's stated preference drug may prefer continue treatment end study . The secondary objective evaluate reason patient preference assess patient preference questionnaire ; evaluate fatigue assess FACIT-Fatigue quality life assess EuroQoL EQ-5D ; evaluate dose modification time dose modification ; evaluate safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Preference Study Pazopanib Versus Sunitinib Advanced Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double-blind , cross-over study evaluate patient preference pazopanib versus sunitinib patient locally advance metastatic RCC receive prior systemic therapy advance metastatic RCC . Approximately 160 eligible patient stratify base ECOG performance status ( 0 vs. 1 ) number metastatic site disease ( 0 1 vs. 2+ ) . The study consist two 10-weeks treatment period two-week wash-out period treatment period . Patients receive pazopanib sunitinib treatment sequentially . At end second treatment period , patient preference disease assessment evaluate patient unblinded . Further treatment discretion physician . Further treatment pazopanib available within study . Patients require treatment complete study point . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio receive blind ( overencapsulated ) study drug : either 800mg pazopanib orally 10 week follow 50mg sunitinib orally 10 week 50mg sunitinib orally 10 week follow 800mg pazopanib orally 10 week . A two-week washout period separate treatment period ( medical monitor consult ongoing AEs need resolve wash-out period need extend ) . The regimen sunitinib 4 week treatment follow 2 week treatment . To maintain double-blind two week drug patient sunitinib ( 'Treatment Holiday ' ) , patient take matching placebo . No study drug take wash-out period either arm . Following two-week wash-out period disease assessment , patient plan cross second treatment . Patients informed disease assessment result patient wish come study point due significant response , define 50 % reduction tumour size ( complete response non-measurable disease ) , option unblinded continue whichever treatment , however patient case need discuss medical monitor prior unblinding . Patients sunitinib leave study continue treatment outside study . Patients pazopanib continue pazopanib within pazopanib open-label part study . Conversely , patient significant response wish cross complete study , must document patient note . Patients cross progressive disease follow visit schedule assessment investigator option patient unblinded . The patient ' preference collect analysed contribute primary , exploratory analysis bias cause progress first treatment . Even unblinded , patient may continue receive second treatment may receive open label pazopanib second treatment within study progress pazopanib . Patients withdraw treatment due unacceptable toxicity progression first treatment period cross-over directly second treatment follow 2-week wash-out period . Actual treatment end study discretion investigator take account disease assessment result , laboratory result patient preference . Choice rationale continue treatment document . Patients progress pazopanib prefer continue pazopanib may continue pazopanib follow safety patient come pazopanib due disease progression , toxicity , death patient choice , ever early . Those patient may benefit treatment sunitinib reason receive study follow , patient receive treatment . Patients permit receive supportive care throughout study include transfusion blood blood product , treatment antibiotic , anti-emetics , anti-diarrhoeal agent , analgesic , erythropoietin bisphosphonates , appropriate . The study treatment continue end two treatment period unacceptable toxicity consent withdrawal death , whichever occur first . The patient preference ascertain prior second disease assessment result share patient avoid bias .</detailed_description>
