	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose cediranib maleate give together pemetrexed disodium cisplatin see well work treat patient malignant pleural mesothelioma . Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving pemetrexed disodium cisplatin together cediranib maleate may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Cisplatin With Without Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose cediranib maleate ( cediranib ) combination cisplatin pemetrexed disodium ( pemetrexed ) . ( Phase I ) II . To assess safety toxicity regimen . ( Phase I ) III . To assess whether cisplatin/pemetrexed plus cediranib compare cisplatin/pemetrexed plus placebo improves progression-free survival patient malignant pleural mesothelioma . ( Phase II ) IV . To compare overall survival patient treat cisplatin/pemetrexed plus cediranib treat cisplatin/pemetrexed plus placebo . ( Phase II ) V. To assess safety toxicity profile regimen . ( Phase II ) VI . To assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) disease control rate ( response stable disease ) subset patient measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . ( Phase II ) VII . To assess response rate disease control rate use modify RECIST criterion pleural tumor subset patient measurable disease modify RECIST criterion pleural tumor . ( Phase II ) VIII . To assess rate agreement local central pathology review mesothelioma histologic subtypes . ( Phase II ) IX . To collect specimen bank use future research study . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study cediranib maleate follow phase II study . PHASE I ( CLOSED ) : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive cediranib maleate alone PO QD absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 cediranib maleate PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive cediranib maleate alone PO QD absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium cisplatin arm I placebo PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive placebo alone PO QD absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year 3 year .</detailed_description>
