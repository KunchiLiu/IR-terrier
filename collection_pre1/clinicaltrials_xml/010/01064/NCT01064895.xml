	<brief_summary>This prospective , observational , multi-center study consecutive enrollment . Up 500 patient enrol . All ( consecutive ) adult patient one component Benephit Infusion System plan use participate site eligible enrollment . The objective post-marketing surveillance study collect clinical usage pattern Benephit Infusion Systems . As result , AngioDynamics able ( 1 ) Better understand quantify usage pattern include patient characteristic , adjunctive procedure , infusion agent , ( 2 ) Collect user-interface information overall customer satisfaction , ( 3 ) Monitor post-marketing device performance safety ISO quality adherence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury , AKI , rapid decline renal function characterize decrease urine output and/or increase serum creatinine ( Cr ) , associate worsen clinical outcome increase healthcare cost . AKI may cause numerous factor include interruption perturbation renal blood flow toxin , often factor extra-renal origin . AKI diagnose hospitalize patient one million per year project continue grow , due largely age population increase number medical invasive procedure perform elderly ever-increasing prevalence diabetes mellitus medical complication , well increase awareness within medical community . Treatment option establish acute kidney injury limit consist mainly fluid electrolyte balance ( diuretic and/or IV fluid ) supportive care point dialysis renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) require . Despite advent new drug , sophisticated RRT equipment , increase awareness problem , little changed relative patient outcome , remain poor . Similarly , limited option exist patient know risk factor AKI prevent development due iatrogenic cause ( e.g. , major surgery , exposure contrast medium ) . Targeted Renal Therapy allow direct delivery therapeutically relevant dos various pharmacological agent directly renal bed , potentially reduce dose limiting side effect traditional IV therapy . With Targeted Renal Therapy , TRT , kidney metabolize , conjugate , and/or clear substantial portion many agent immediately ( know `` renal first-pass '' effect ) , reduce amount return systemic circulation via renal vein , thus potentially reduce untoward side effect . While existence renal first-pass effect hypothesize medical literature time , possible take clinical advantage important physiological function prior advent AngioDynamics ' TRT . Thus , TRT potential offer additional preventative treatment opportunity patient risk AKI , establish AKI , respectively .</detailed_description>
