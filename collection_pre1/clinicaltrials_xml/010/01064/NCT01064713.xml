	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn tesetaxel help control metastatic melanoma . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Tesetaxel Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Tesetaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 Groups base enroll study . Each group 2 `` stage . '' Group A : A total 27 patient enrol Group A receive 40mg dose tesetaxel , adjust individual body weight . For Group A , 13 patient enrol Stage 1 . If least 1 patient response 40 mg dose tesetaxel , 14 additional patient enrol Stage 2 dose level . Group B : A total 27 patient enrol Group B receive 50mg dose tesetaxel , adjust individual body weight . For Group B , 13 patient enrol Stage 1 researcher wait see patient Group A respond study drug . If least 1 patient response 50 mg dose tesetaxel , 14 additional patient enrol Stage 2 dose level . Study Drug Administration : No matter Group assign , take tesetaxel capsule mouth morning water ( 6 ounce ) Day 1 21-day study cycle . You must eat drink anything except water ( fast ) least 4 hour take tesetaxel . After fast 4 hour take tesetaxel , may eat average sized meal . Before take tesetaxel , receive drug prevent nausea vomiting . The study doctor discus . If rash allergic reaction , may receive antihistamine and/or corticosteroid . If develop low number white blood cell red blood cell , may give growth factor drug receive transfusion . These drug may give mouth vein . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles : -Your medical history , include side effect may drug may take , record . On Day 9 ( +/- 1 day ) Day 20 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles : - Any side effect may drug may take record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Within 5 day start cycle 3 , 5 , 7 every cycle thereafter : - You CT scan chest , stomach , hip area . - Photographs melanoma skin take . - Any side effect may drug may take record . After last dose tesetaxel , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Within 3 week last dose tesetaxel : - You CT scan chest , stomach , hip area . - Photographs melanoma skin take . - Any side effect may drug may take , record . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-Up Visits : If melanoma get bad study , visit every 2 month 12 month first dose study drug . At visit : - You CT scan chest , stomach , hip area . - Photographs melanoma skin take . - Any side effect may drug may take , record . - You ask treatment may receive . If disease get bad study , follow phone call every 2 month 12 month first dose study drug . During call , ask feeling therapy receiving . These call take 5 minute . This investigational study . Tesetaxel FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 54 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
