	<detailed_description>Lipoprotein ( ) [ Lp ( ) ] independent risk factor cardiovascular disease . Non-medical treatment measure ( e.g . dietary therapy weight loss ) hardly influence Lp ( ) plasma concentration . Drug therapy limit influence , e.g . treatment niacin .

In patient pronounced elevation Lp ( ) normal LDL cholesterol level , suffer progressive cardiovascular disease , treatment lipid apheresis seem last-resort treatment option . The current trial evaluate effectiveness lipid apheresis cardioavascular endpoint . The trial randomize multicenter trial Germany . Patients randomized apheresis group control group . All patient receive maximal risk minimize therapy . The apheresis group receive addition weekly lipid apheresis . The principal outcome parameter composite endpoint non-fatal myocardial infarction , interventional therapeutic procedure ( PCI , stenting ) , coronary bypass surgery ( CABG ) , non-fatal ischemic cerebrovascular accident , hospitalization due acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , critical limb ischemia , peripheral arterial revascularization procedure ; amputation , death cardiovascular cause .</detailed_description>
