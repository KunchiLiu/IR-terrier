	<brief_summary>Approximately 5 % adult asthma difficult control disease account 80 % total cost asthma due recurrent healthcare contact include hospital admission . The reason `` difficult asthma '' multi-factorial , important element many patient non-adherence steroid therapy . Recent qualitative analysis investigator group identify number individual group theme , relate non-adherence steroid treatment . Many theme steroid phobia , inaccurate / lack knowledge , negative attitude inability deal side-effects , potentially modifiable investigator believe , unless issue address , individual patient level , adherence unlikely improve . This randomised parallel group study examine nursing intervention try improve adherence consequence , asthma control , group difficult asthmatic non-adherence identified significant factor . The study use needs-led menu driven individualise intervention compare current best asthma care . The primary outcome measure adherence therapy , however asthma control , lung function asthma relate quality life , patient ' attitude asthma treatment level anxiety depression also examine . Addressing issue non-adherence fundamental improve asthma management difficult group concomitant reduction health care cost improvement patient ' quality life</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plan investigation The study single blind randomise control trial . Patients recruit attend difficult asthma clinic Belfast City Hospital deem non−adherent ( see ) . Difficult asthma define ; 1. persist asthma symptom ( Asthma control score &gt; 3 ) ( ACS ) , despite detailed assessment management ; 2. minimal maintenance therapy long act B2−agonist inhaled steroid ( 800 mcg BDP equivalent ) 3. least 1 course systemic steroid precede 12 month . Non adherence define prescription fill &lt; 50 % prescribed anti−inflammatory inhale therapy utilized precede 6 month ( GP prescription record ) . All subject invite take part give consent take part study . Exclusion criterion medication adherence , condition asthma contribute persist symptom ; current smoker ; significant co−morbidity due condition asthma . Primary Outcome measure Improvement adherence steroid therapy intervention ( 7 day prednisolone ( serum assay ) inhale steroid therapy ( prescription counting ) . Secondary outcome measure Improvement Asthma Control Scores ( ACS ) Improvement asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( AQLQ ) Improvement Lung function Reduction course rescue steroid Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale These routinely measure part difficult asthma service . Study design Pre run−in period 1 . Assessment inclusion / exclusion criterion 2 . Full inform consent Run−in period ( 1 week ) − All participant Week 1 Prednisolone course − 7 day course 1 . ACS/Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) Day 1 ( Lung function breathe test ) 2 . Serum prednisolone/cortisol urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio Day 7 - measure adherence prednisolone 3 . Asthma control score/FEV1 Day 7 Randomisation Patients randomize two group either control ( usual care ) intervention group use random number generator . Intervention Intervention Group− A nurse−led programme intervention devise . It two stage incorporate : 1 . Semi−structured audio tap interview identify individual reason non−adherence assessment readiness change behaviour . 2 . An individualised package incorporating : 1 . Asthma education programme address specific gap asthma knowledge request information 2 . Motivational interview base stage change model encourage change adherence 3 . Psychological therapy involve ( ) relaxation therapy ( b ) cognitive behavioural technique look negative catastrophic thought ( c ) panic cycle adapt respiratory patient Patients see regularly ( individual need determine time span ) period 3 month . Control group - standard asthma management . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure Adherence determine baseline , 3 9 month prescription fill define outcome completion programme . During period follow−up , 7 day course prednisolone indicate clinical ground , serum prednisolone/cortisol urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio measure completion course . Secondary outcome measure These measure 3 9 month There currently 200 patient attend difficult asthma service Belfast City Hospital Trust fulfil definition difficult asthma . No data available specific population regard adherence inhale therapy base adherence prednisolone adherence data inhale therapy severity asthma , would anticipate 50 % variably adherent therapy . 1−6 month − Screening population / liaise primary care / psychological intervention train 6 months−18 month − Patient recruitment intervention package deliver 18−36 months− Follow−up data analysis .</detailed_description>
