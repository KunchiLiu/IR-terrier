	<brief_summary>Cough common , disruptive time disable symptom often prompt patient seek medical attention . Determining cause ( ) chronic cough challenging , costly . Asthma airway disorder among common cause chronic cough ; cough sole symptom asthma . Little known patient asthma primarily cough develop symptom asthma shortness breath wheeze . Improved understanding reason different manifestation may lead new effective treatment strategy . We notice difference pressure measurement inside chest patient mostly cough induced bronchoconstriction , might part explanation vary symptom . This study compare lung mechanical response methacholine mannitol-induced induced airway narrow typical asthma , cough variant asthma ( CVA ) airway inflammatory disorder asthma.The purpose research explore pathophysiology sensory-mechanics cough individual asthma , CVA methacholine-induced cough normal airway sensitivity use mannitol high-dose methacholine bronchoprovocation testing .</brief_summary>
