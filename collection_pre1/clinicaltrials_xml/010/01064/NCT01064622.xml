	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without Vismodegib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To compare progression-free survival advance pancreatic cancer patient treat combination gemcitabine plus GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) versus gemcitabine plus placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival advance pancreatic cancer patient treat combination gemcitabine plus GDC-0449 versus gemcitabine plus placebo II . To compare objective response rate advance pancreatic cancer patient treat combination gemcitabine plus GDC-0449 versus gemcitabine alone . III . To determine toxicity experience pancreatic cancer patient treat combination gemcitabine plus GDC-0449 . IV . To determine activity , exploratory analysis , gemcitabine plus GDC-0449 patient progress gemcitabine plus placebo . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tumor immunohistochemical expression pattern proteins Hh pathway , include sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) , indian hedgehog ( Ihh ) , patch tumor suppressor gene ( PTCH ) , smoothen protein ( SMO ) , GLI1 2 , within pancreatic tissue obtain time curative intent surgery predict response prognosticate outcome patient treat without GDC-0449 time relapse . II . To determine prognostic ability ( relapse free survival , [ RFS ] ) biologic marker resect patient archival cohort patient undergoing resection . III . To determine expression pattern pancreatic CSC marker , include CD44 , CD24 , CD133 , aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) epithelial specific antigen ( ESA ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) archival tissue relation Hh pathway marker correlate clinical outcome . IV . To determine whether high baseline serum Shh , well change serum Shh treatment , predict treatment efficacy and/or prognosticate clinical outcome . V. To determine frequency mutation Hh pathway gene , PTCH , SMO , SuFU , presence absence mutation correlate clinical outcome . VI . To determine frequency amplification Hh pathway gene , gene copy number quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) GLI1 SMO tumor high protein expression see IHC . Gene amplification correlate clinical outcome . VII . To determine correlation K-ras mutation , MET RON expression , amplification , mutation status Hh pathway abnormality , CSC marker , clinical outcome . VIII . To determine baseline contrast perfusion imaging volume transfer constant ( Ktrans ) within primary liver metastatic lesion measure 256-detector computed tomography ( CT ) scanner predict objective response rate , clinical endpoint include progression-free survival ( PFS ) , treatment gemcitabine GDC-0449/placebo . ( University Chicago ONLY ) IX . To determine treatment Gemcitabine GDC-0449 improve tumor perfusion , measure Ktrans , course treatment serial CT scan every 2 cycle , compare tumor treat Gemcitabine placebo . ( University Chicago ONLY ) X . To determine improved tumor perfusion GDC-0449 treatment ( observe ) improve objective response rate clinical endpoint include PFS . ( University Chicago ONLY ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , safety lead-in study ( part I ) follow randomize study ( part II ) . An initial 6 patient enrolled part I portion study . If dose-limiting toxicity occur patient , subsequent patient enrol part II portion study . PART I ( safety lead-in study ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART II ( randomize study ) : Patients stratify accord disease status ( recurrent surgery v metastatic ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride 1000 mg/m^2 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 placebo PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . At time disease progression , patient unblinded may crossover arm II . ARM II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride 1000 mg/m^2 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue , blood , serum , plasma sample collect periodically biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
