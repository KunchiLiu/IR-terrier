	<brief_title>Docetaxel And Cisplatin With Without Erlotinib For Metastatic Or Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of Head And Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Erlotinib design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell . Blocking protein may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Docetaxel drug design target destroy cancer cell . Cisplatin platinum atom center . The platinum suppose poison cancer cell , may cause die . It also may stop replication transcription cancer cell ' DNA ( genetic material cell ) . Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . You equal chance assign either group . Both group receive 6 3-week cycle ( 18 week total ) docetaxel cisplatin carboplatin , combine `` study tablet . '' Your treat doctor decide receive cisplatin carboplatin . One group 's `` study tablet '' erlotinib , group 's `` study tablet '' placebo ( tablet look like study drug active ingredient ) . Neither study doctor know receive erlotinib placebo . However , need safety , study doctor able find receiving . If disease get bad tolerate `` study tablet '' end combination chemotherapy treatment , continue receive `` study tablet '' every day long benefit . This call `` maintenance '' phase study . Study Drug Administration : Cisplatin/Carboplatin docetaxel give vein every 3 week . Both drug give Day 1 every cycle . Docetaxel give first , 1 hour . Cisplatin/Carboplatin give second , 2 hour . Erlotinib ( placebo ) take every day mouth , cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You take tablet empty stomach , least 1 hour 2 hour meal . You take tablet around time day . Your eat habit around time take tablet stay study . lf vomit , take another tablet next schedule dose . You continue take erlotinib ( placebo ) every day long benefit . Study Visits : Within 7 day Cycles 2-6 : - You ask side effect may experience drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask current smoking status tobacco use . - You give next supply study tablet , return tablet count . - If doctor think need , woman able become pregnant blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Within 7 day Cycles 3 5 : - You CT MRI scan chest x-rays check status disease . If doctor think need , may image scan . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire . The questionnaire take 15 minute complete . `` Maintenance '' Phase : Every 21 day : - You ask side effect may experience drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask current smoking status tobacco use . - You give next supply study tablet , return capsule count . If doctor think need , woman able become pregnant blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Every 6 week : - You CT MRI scan chest x-rays check status disease . If doctor think need , may image scan . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire . The questionnaire take 15 minute complete . Length Study : You stay study 6 cycle chemotherapy study tablet ( erlotinib placebo ) , follow `` maintenance '' phase . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect . You may also stop receive study drug doctor think best interest stop . If leave study early reason , try complete end-of-study testing . End-of-Treatment Visit : For patient , End Treatment visit take place 30 day last dose study drug/placebo . The following test procedure perform : - You ask side effect may experience drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , woman able become pregnant blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Follow-Up Contact : After End-of-Treatment visit , may contact collect information disease status , treatment receive , side effect experience . You ( family member designees ) may contact telephone , write , e-mail , clinic visit . This information may also collect check medical record . This investigational study . Erlotinib approve FDA treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Its use study experimental . Docetaxel , cisplatin , carboplatin FDA approve commercially available . Up 120 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
