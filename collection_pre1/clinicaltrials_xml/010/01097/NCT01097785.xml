	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) lead cause morbidity mortality United States incidence prevalence disease continual rise . An overactive sympathetic nervous system become hallmark characteristic HF . Although sympathetic activation initially beneficial maintain cardiac output , blood pressure perfusion vital organ , long term become deleterious contribute worsen HF sudden cardiac death . Indeed , recent finding HF patient suggest sympathetic overactivity marker poor prognosis play causative role development disease . Thus , sympathetic nervous system constitute putative drug target treatment HF . However , despite aggressive medical management , include conventional anti-adrenergic strategy , sympathetic nerve activity ( SNA ) show remain abnormally high HF patient improvement survival limited . Thus , treatment strategy include reduce SNA deleterious consequence warrant . Recent finding clinical trial indicate 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) improve survival irrespective cholesterol lower bring pleiotropic ( i.e. , cholesterol independent ) effect statins forefront . An important pleiotropic effect recently report experimental HF , yet directly test human HF , ability statin reduce rest sympathetic outflow . Several study pacing-induced HF rabbit demonstrate statin normalize excessive sympathetic activation HF state . Thus , goal proposal determine whether finding experimental HF translate clinical setting human HF . Our central hypothesis statin reduce sympathetic overactivity HF patient . To test hypothesis directly measure muscle SNA one month statin therapy . In addition , begin elucidate potential mechanism ( ) involve statin-induced reduction SNA use technique partial autospectral analysis ass baroreflex-independent ( i.e. , central ) component SNA application neck pressure neck suction ass baroreflex-dependent control SNA . The significance propose experiment potential statin therapy reduce SNA HF patient provide novel therapeutic strategy target heighten rest sympathetic drive present HF . The study utilize randomize crossover placebo-controlled study design . Subjects come research laboratory , administration either placebo Simvastatin one month standard therapeutic dosage 40 mg per day . Subjects carefully monitor adverse effect examine blood sample baseline 4 week marker liver , kidney , muscle damage . If subject 's response one month Simvastatin therapy minimal , decrease LDL cholesterol le 25 % , ask participate additional 2 week Simvastatin administration dosage 80 mg per day . During baseline , visit 4 wks , additional visit ( necessary ) subject undergo follow experimental measurement procedure , take approximately four hour . All measurement procedure perform principal investigator train research personnel . To completely obtain data necessary project , would expect take 5 year . This base goal initially collect additional data add preliminary data recent American Heart Association ( AHA ) grant submission submit project NIH grant . Based power calculation previous experience use experimental measure , take approximately 30 heart failure patient determine influence statin sympathetic nerve activity . This permit statistical comparison take account technical difficulty obtain repeat quality sympathetic nerve recording patient well data collection necessary determine potential contribution baroreflex-dependent -independent mechanism . Healthy control subject match HF patient age , sex , body mass index , know factor influence rest SNA , also study . These study important comparison determine whether statin-induced reduction SNA specific HF general overall effect statin therapy . It anticipate identify patient already statin therapy may take time therapy standard patient group . We choose Simvastatin study statin choice pacing-induced HF rabbit study report normalization rest SNA statin therapy . We anticipate future study identify efficacy different statin reduce SNA , impact different dosage , different duration treatment warrant .</detailed_description>
