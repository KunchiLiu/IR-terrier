	<brief_summary>Forty 18-year-old social drinker select sample test specific aim 1 ( `` Prospective Assessment Adolescent Drinking Trajectories With Computer-Assisted Self-administration Ethanol ( CASE ) '' ; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01063166 ) . The functional magnetic resonance image blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( fMRI BOLD ) activity relate disinhibition measure Stop Signal task assess continuous infusion alcohol , clamp arterial Breath Alcohol Concentration ( aBAC ) 60 mg % approximately one hour . It examine whether fMRI BOLD activity associate initial drinking trajectory alcohol consumption age 18 age 20 identify specific aim 1 . Furthermore , fMRI use Taylor Aggression Paradigm determine brain area mediate increase physical aggression continuous infusion alcohol describe . All participant undergo alcohol placebo fMRI session .</brief_summary>
