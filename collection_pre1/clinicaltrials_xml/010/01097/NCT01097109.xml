	<brief_title>The Effect Somatic Dysfunction Pelvis , Sacrum Lower Lumbar Spine Weight Bearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most source claim individual leg length discrepancy , tend place weight shorter low extremity.1,2 Few case state opposite true.3 Many health care practitioner diagnose leg length discrepancy . Osteopathic physician practice Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine ( OMM ) also diagnose leg length discrepancy . They use test evaluate whether leg length discrepancy structural functional . A structural leg length discrepancy associate shorten bony structures.4 The structure affect due congenital defect , result possible structural shorten tibia femur , slip capital femoral epiphysis ( SCFE ) , congenital dislocation . Other cause structural leg length discrepancy include post total hip replacement , infection , tumor , paralysis , trauma , include fracture gross length limb altered.4 A structural leg length discrepancy accurately assess physically measure distance anterior superior iliac spine ( ASIS ) medial malleolus.4 The reliable method diagnose structural short leg full body radiograph . 6 A functional leg length discrepancy result alter mechanic low extremity . It think functional short leg occur secondarily rotate pelvis cause joint contracture and/or axial misalignment , include scoliosis.4 In osteopathic literature ; functional leg length discrepancy also think result alter position pelvis sacrum . It also think osteopathic philosophy position fifth lumbar vertebra affect position sacrum . Therefore dysfunction L5 change position sacrum functional short leg created.2 ( p.780-782 ) A common cause functional leg length discrepancy diagnose osteopathic physician sacral base unleveling.5 The way leg length discrepancy cause unleveling sacrum femoral head longer leg drive pelvis posterior rotation via force place acetabular contact . Then pelvis typically rotate forward attempt lengthen short leg , cause sacral base become unlevel.5 In addition , sacral base tilt toward side short leg.6 Standing postural x-ray , outline sacral declination , often used chiropractor osteopathic physician diagnose functional leg length discrepancies.6 Another way functional leg length discrepancy confirm supine long sit test , test presence innominate rotation may affect leg length cause . There research know support presence somatic dysfunction , leg length discrepancy alter weight bear low extremity secondary . It common practice among osteopathic physician utilize OMM diagnose musculoskeletal somatic dysfunction pelvis , sacrum lumbar spine . All finding contribute low back pain . Therefore , common practice physician diagnose leg length discrepancy , may ultimately result low back pain . Somatic dysfunction osteopathic nomenclature define 'impaired altered function relate component somatic ( body framework ) system : Skeletal , arthrodial Myofascial structure , related vascular , lymphatic neural elements'.2 There specific somatic dysfunction lead leg length difference . These effect include sacral base tilt toward side short leg , low iliac crest short leg side , forward rotation innominate short side and/or posterior rotation innominate side longer leg compensatory measure . The lumbar spine develop convexity toward side short leg.6 Their definition follow : Anteriorly rotate innominate : Entire innominate appear rotated anterior relation opposite innominate . The ASIS inferior caudad PSIS superior cephalad.2 ( 776-778 ) , 6 Posteriorly rotate innominate : Entire innominate appear rotated posterior relation opposite hip bone . The ASIS superior cephalad PSIS inferior caudad.2 ( 776-778 ) , 6 Superior shear innominate : ASIS , PSIS pubic ramus superior cephalad opposite side.2 ( 776-778 ) , 6 Inferior shear innominate : ASIS , PSIS pubic ramus inferior caudad opposite side.2 ( 776-778 ) , 6 The way osteopathic physician determine side somatic dysfunction ASIS compression test . This defined follow : ASIS compression test : Test lateralization somatic dysfunction sacrum , innominate pubic symphysis . A posterior compression normally produce palpatory sense 'give ' 'resilience ' innominate glide slightly posterior sacroiliac joint side . Somatic dysfunction pelvis side compression produce resistance test determine side lateralization analogous determine dysfunctional side . This interpreted positive ASIS compression test.2 ( 777 ) Individuals suffer type osseous soft tissue traumatic injury last three month make suitable subject evaluation somatic dysfunction ' effect weight bear . Neither individual suffer type osseous soft tissue injury low extremity joint ( knee , ankle , hip ) last twelve month . As state earlier , leg length discrepancy may result trauma . Individuals suffer traumatic injury within last three month may exhibit antalgic compensatory posture may displace weight bear one low extremity other.7 This ensure treatment population homogenous possible improve reliability study . Individuals suffer low extremity injury last twelve month may also exhibit altered weight bear distribution low extremity . This may something , depend chronicity problem , alters weight bear extended period time may vary depend person.7 Therefore , exclude individual suffer low extremity trauma last twelve month also exclude study allow homogenous characteristic sample population .
