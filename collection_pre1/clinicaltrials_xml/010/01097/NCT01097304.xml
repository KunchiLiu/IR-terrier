	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability UDCA ( ursodiol ) treatment reverse oxidative deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage esophageal epithelium subject Barrett 's esophagus . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect UDCA treatment gastric bile acid composition cell proliferation Barrett 's epithelium . OUTLINE : Patients receive ursodiol orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
