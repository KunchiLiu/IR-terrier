	<brief_summary>The objective study assess superiority biodegradable polymer base limus-eluting stent ( Nobori® ) compare permanent polymer base everolimus-eluting stent ( XIENCE V® ) regard absolute percentage uncover stent strut segment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Test Safety Biodegradable Permanent Limus-Eluting Stents Assessed Optical Coherence Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mid-term efficacy drug-eluting stent well-established , ongoing debate potential increase incidence late stent thrombosis , particularly discontinuation thienopyridine therapy , well delay onset restenosis catch-up phenomenon permanent polymer-based DES . The extent strut coverage reduction expose thrombogenic material show associated inflammatory reaction grade incidence stent thrombosis . The optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) intravascular image modality base light . The principle similar intravascular ultrasound , due much short wave length light , offer much good resolution 10µm , enable exact determination strut coverage , neointimal thickness , vessel size , presence dissection , even presence inflammation .</detailed_description>
