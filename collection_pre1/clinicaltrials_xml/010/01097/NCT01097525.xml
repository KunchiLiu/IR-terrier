	<criteria>1 . Normal , healthy active adult access medical care Walter Reed Health Care System . 2 . Male female least 21 year old time preoperative examination , sign informed consent . The low age limit 21 year intend ensure documentation refractive stability . 3 . Myopic spherical manifest refractive error 1.00D 10.00D inclusive , 4.00D manifest cylinder refractive error . 4 . Inclusion base preop Central Corneal Thickness ( CCT ) assess accord Residual Stromal Bed Thickness 5 . BSCVA least 20/20 study eye . 6 . Soft contact lens user must remove lens least two week prior baseline followup measurement . 7 . Hard contact lens user ( PMMA rigid gas permeable lens ) must remove lens least four week prior baseline followup measurement . 8 . Refractive stability must document previous refraction . Spherical cylindrical portion manifest refraction must vary 0.50 diopter previous 12 month . 9 . Exhibits strong motivation keep followup visit . 10 . Available evaluation Walter Reed 1 year followup period 11 . If select , willing available undergo test Ft. Belvoir study period . 12 . All service member must sign command authorization receive government sponsor refractive surgery . The signed command authorization include original application . 13 . Access transportation meet followup requirement . 1 . Residual , recurrent active ocular disease congenital corneal abnormality either eye iritis , uveitis , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , herpetic keratitis , vernal conjunctivitis , lagophthalmos , corneal scarring , anterior basement membrane disease , recurrent erosion , glaucoma , previous steroid responder , occludable chamber angle , visually significant cataract . 2 . History previous eye surgery trauma , include previous refractive surgery . 3 . Dry eye reflect Schirmer 's test , subjective complaint symptom dry eye , finding slit lamp exam would consistent dry eye ( e.g . superficial punctuate keratitis ) . 4 . Corneal thickness insufficient allow residual remain stromal bed le 300 micron eye . The residual stromal bed thickness determine subtract LASIK flap thickness depth ablation total central corneal thickness measure pachymetry . 5 . Female subject pregnant , breastfeed intend become pregnant study . This standard care exclusion refractive surgery Walter Reed Refractive Surgery Center medication routinely give part procedure . Standard care analgesia consist medication ( e.g . narcotic ) label Pregnancy Category `` C '' FDA . Teratogenic effect know , however , physical dependence neonate may occur mother give narcotic . Female subject give urine pregnancy test prior participate study rule pregnancy . 6 . Concurrent topical systemic medication may impair heal , include corticosteroid , antimetabolite , isotretinoin ( Accutane ) , amiodarone hydrochloride ( Cordarone ) and/or sumatripin ( Imitrex ) . 7 . Significant corneal neovascularization . 8 . Progressive myopia keratoconus . 9 . Medical condition ( ) , , judgment investigator , may impair heal , include limited : collagen vascular disease , autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency disease , ocular herpes zoster simplex . 10 . Patients know sensitivity inappropriate responsiveness medication use postoperative course . 11 . Any physical mental impairment would preclude participation examination . 12 . Inability meet mandate followup visit schedule reason duty hour , impend deployment , PCS .</criteria>
