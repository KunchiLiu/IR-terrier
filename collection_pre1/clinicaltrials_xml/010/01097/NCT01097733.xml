	<brief_summary>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) widely accept treatment lead improved clinical outcome patient refractory congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , systolic dysfunction , wide QRS duration . However , require implantation expensive device ( $ 30,000 ) 1/3 patient clinical improvement . Inadequate amount LV dyssynchrony suboptimal lead placement may limit clinical response . Dual-Source compute tomography ( DSCT ) allow subtle detection myocardial contraction assess LV dyssynchrony , also assess coronary venous anatomy scar burden . Thus DSCT may ideal noninvasive modality predict response CRT .</brief_summary>
