	<brief_summary>This project evaluate new therapy patient severe form MS know progressive MS . These patient severely limited ability walk function everyday life . The exercise therapy propose recumbent cross trainer allow patient seat move arm legs time resistive foot pedal arm lever . The recumbent cross trainer safe easy use people disability cost-effective compare rehabilitation equipment . Before recumbent trainer become part mainstream MS therapy , important determine effective exercise therapy improve functional performance quality life . In study compare effect recumbent cross training support treadmill walk functional psychological outcome . Further , since new therapy progressive MS patient , also want determine safe enjoyable use . We hypothesize recumbent stepper training safe well-tolerated progressive MS patient . Both train intervention beneficial improve walk function psychosocial outcome . Recumbent stepper strain likely great effect upper extremity function , support treadmill walk great effect low extremity function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose evaluate clinical utility efficacy new therapeutic exercise modality patient progressive MS severe functional impairment . Progressive MS patient limit treatment option reach high disability level faster rate relapse remit MS patient . Consequently , find solution maintain function improve quality life patient progressive MS essential . A traditional training modality patient limited mobility body-weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) . Our preliminary result support efficacy BWSTT progressive MS patient ; however , financial burden labour-intensive nature BWSTT make viable option setting . For aforementioned reason , propose total body recumbent stepper training ( TBRST ) alternative therapy progressive MS patient mobility impairment . TBRST advantageous BWSTT low set-up maintenance cost , easily use patient limited mobility require minimal assistance operate . TBRST potential become part conventional MS treatment program could easily incorporate home community setting . The primary aim investigation establish safety satisfaction TBRST progressive MS patient . Second , plan determine TBRST effective BWSTT therapeutic modality . Twenty patient progressive MS ( primary secondary ) high disability level ( EDSS 6.0-8.0 ) recruit participate study . Both primary secondary MS patient include due similarity disease progression lack available alternative treatment population . Patients randomize either TBRST BWSTT intervention ; 10 patient group . Patients TBRST program train use Nustep ( TRS 4000 ) recumbent cross trainer . The recumbent cross trainer allow patient move legs natural step motion bilateral reciprocal movement arm seat position . Foot strap , leg stabilizer hand stabilizer may use add control proper body alignment necessary . Patients BWSTT group exercise use Woodway Loco-system allow portion patient 's body-weight off-loaded overhead pulley system . Treadmill therapists guide patient ' leg proper gait motion assist low limb control . Participants intervention complete three weekly exercise session 30min , duration 12 week . Perceived exertion use indicator exercise intensity guide program progression . Both intervention group maintain perceived exertion 5-7 Borg CR10 Scale throughout exercise program . All patient evaluate baseline follow 12 week variety outcome measure . Primary outcome measure safety satisfaction TBRST . Secondary outcomes functional ability use EDSS MSFC , quality life use MSQOL-54 , fatigue use MFIS MS self-efficacy use MSSE . The propose research take place one year enrolment intervention program commence grade manner .</detailed_description>
