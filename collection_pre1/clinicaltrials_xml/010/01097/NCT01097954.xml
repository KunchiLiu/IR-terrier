	<brief_summary>Exercise induce bronchospasm ( EIB ) , also know exercise induce asthma ( EIA ) transient obstruction airflow trigger exertion . It well know identity , center discussion recent year , particularly athlete ' world . It common asthmatic individual ( regardless severity disease ) , also see otherwise healthy subject , lead general consensus pathophysiology different asthma . The concentration exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) various airway &amp; respiratory disorder , particularly asthma , deeply study . Its use noninvasive monitoring asthma control ( reflect airway eosinophilic inflammation ) closely examine put clinical practice . FeNO significantly elevate asthma . Elevated FeNO level also note patient hospitalize COPD exacerbation , acidosis , rhinitis , bronchiectasis , active pulmonary sarcoidosis , active fibrosing alveolitis , acute lung allograft rejection . Decreased FeNO level see patient primary ciliary dyskinesia , cystic fibrosis , PiZZ phenotype-related alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency , pulmonary hypertension Two study address variation FeNO EIB contradictory result . Scollo et al . find change FeNO either healthy asthmatic child 6-min vigorous exertion exercise laboratory study 24 asthmatic 18 control child . Terada et al . report , 39 subject , decrease FeNO subject EIB increase healthy control . It well accept pathophysiology exercise induce bronchospasm similar asthma . Certainly inflammation airway appear eosinophilic . Understanding disease mechanism key factor adequately manage . This prospective study measure online exhale nitric oxide involve child 8 21 year old . The study group include child come pulmonary exercise test exercise laboratory locate Pediatric Pulmonary Division office . The study conduct fall 2009 spring 2011 . The change FeNO measurement correlate change % predict FEV1 . We consider significant decrease FEV1 post exercise 15 % and/or decrease FEF25-75 20 % persist 15 minute complete exercise . We also record symptom report subject test . An exercise test standard care suspect exercise-induced asthma . The subject parent come exercise test offer opportunity participate study . The subject come exercise test perform spirometry FeNO measurement prior start test . According exercise laboratory protocol 1 minute warm low speed , follow 6 minute high speed ( enough increase heart rate 90 % predict ) 3 minute cool low speed perform . Then spirometry repeat 3 , 5 , 10 15 minute FeNO measurement take 5 , 10 15 minute . We analyze data find significant change FeNO measurement exercise .</brief_summary>
