	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure sentinel lymph node mapping may help doctor find patient risk develop micrometastases plan good treatment . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II/III trial study micrometastases patient stage I stage II localize colon cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Micrometastases Patients With Stage I Stage II Localized Colon Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine subset patient stage I II localize , resectable colon cancer ( pN0 ) risk develop systemic metastasis . - To determine clinical prognostic relevance occult nodal isolated tumor cell micrometastases patient . - To determine benefit adjuvant chemotherapy patient pN0micro+ colon cancer . OUTLINE : This phase II feasibility study ( stage 1 ) follow phase III multicenter , open-label , randomize , control study ( stage 2 ) . - Stage 1 ( phase II feasibility study ) After undergo plan curative resection follow ex vivo sentinel lymph node mapping ( SLNM ) . Resected sample examine . The sentinel lymph node deem pN0 disease ( macroscopic metastasis angioinvasion ) evaluate micrometastases serial section immunohistochemistry use pan-cytokeratin . pN0micro+ disease define isolated tumor cell ( ITC ) &lt; 0.2 mm micrometastasis 0.2 - 2 mm . Patients pN0 disease followed-up every 6 month 3 year annually 2 year . - stage 2 ( phase III randomize study ) : Patients undergo plan surgery ex vivo SLNM stage 1 . Patients pN0micro- disease assign arm C ; patient pN0micro+ disease randomize 1 2 intervention arm ( arm A B ) . . - Arm A ( pN0micro+ ) : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 OR oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 alone accord standard protocol . Treatment repeat every 4 week 8 course . Patients followed-up every 6 month 3 year annually 2 year . - Arm B ( pN0micro+ ) : Patients followed-up every 6 month 3 year annually 2 year . - Arm C ( pN0micro- ) : Patients followed-up every 6 month 3 year annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
