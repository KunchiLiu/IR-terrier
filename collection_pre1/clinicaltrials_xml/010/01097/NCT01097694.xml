	<detailed_description>Severe asthmatic remain poorly control despite high dos standard asthma therapy even daily dos systemic corticosteroid equivalent . They account large proportion morbidity mortality associate asthma . Features seem characterize many patient disorder include persistent inflammation , symptom , airway hyperresponsiveness face corticosteroid therapy . Mast cell powerful , long-lived tissue dwell effector cell resistant corticosteroid effect implicate pathobiology asthma . Mast cell airway smooth muscle find major distinguish difference asthmatic non-asthmatic eosinophil airway disease ; putative circulating mast cell progenitor increase 5 fold asthma . Stem cell factor ( SCF ) critical mast cell homeostasis upregulation pleiotropic effect mast cell eosinophil . SCF level elevate relation asthma severity SCF antibodies block hyperresponsiveness inflammation remodel murine asthma model . Imatinib , specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor , inhibits cKit ( Kit ) , receptor SCF mast cell . Imatinib dose equivalent , , dose safely used human , also mimic exceed anti-SCF effect murine asthma model . Therefore would like know Does imatinib , inhibitor Kit , ameliorate severe asthma , association effect lung mast cell phenotype and/or function ? Specific Aims study : Specific Aim 1 : To investigate whether , patient persistent airway responsiveness poor asthma control despite intensive asthma therapy , 24 week imatinib therapy result reduction airway responsiveness secondary indicator asthma control , airway inflammation , structural change airway . Patients treat imatinib randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial . Assessments include methacholine AMP reactivity , airway function , symptom , airway wall thickness CT scan , analysis induce sputum , non-invasive marker airway inflammation , bronchoscopy include endobronchial biopsy bronchoalveolar lavage - end therapy . Specific Aim 2 : To investigate whether , patient persistent airway responsiveness poor asthma control despite intensive asthma therapy , 24 week imatinib therapy result change airway mast cell population and/or phenotype .</detailed_description>
