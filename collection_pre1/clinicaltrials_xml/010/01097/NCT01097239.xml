	<brief_summary>This single centre pilot trial establish feasibility role endoluminal HIFU patient locally advanced cancer within pelvis either primary recurrent available current therapy inappropriate and/or exhaust . The aim make preliminary assessment efficacy &amp; dosage evaluation randomise control trial . Whilst efficacy data limit small feasibility study ; radiological , biochemical histopathological analysis patient patient specimen , along quality life questionnaire ( QoL ) , use provide preliminary measure efficacy patient cohort . These analysis allow examination biochemical , metabolomic histological change associate HIFU treatment cancer within pelvis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Role Transrectal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Rectal Pelvic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CURRENT TREATMENT OF LOCALLY ADVANCED PELVIC CANCER Colorectal cancer This common condition 40,000 new case year United Kingdom . The optimal multimodality management stage III &amp; IV rectal cancer remain increase challenge . There high risk local recurrence poor survival report patient treated surgery alone . About 20 % patient may present locally advanced tumour , partially totally fix ( T3/T4 ) . Until recently widely accept validated method define preoperatively either locally advanced rectal cancer unresectable disease . The use pre-operative pelvic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) predict likelihood achieve R0 resection ( Beets-Tan et al 2001 , Brown et al 2003 ) result improved selection . Pre-operative chemoradiotherapy downstage locally advanced tumour , result high resection rate achieve reduce risk local recurrence ( Bosset et al 1993 , Rich et al 1995 ) . Gynaecological cancer Treating advanced pelvic malignancy include vaginal , ovarian , endometrial cervical cancer similarly challenge . Disease recurrence site surgical resection adjacent lymph node also preclude curative option , due chemotherapy resistance , reach maximum safe radiotherapy limit unsuitable surgical option . It propose High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) may become another modality treatment locally advance unresectable pelvic disease . RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY Colorectal cancer This third common cause cancer cancer death men woman ( 40,000 case 16 000 death per year UK ) . Worldwide , approximately 1 million case 500 000 death per annum . Primary treatment usually surgical , appropriate case , adjuvant neo−adjuvant therapy currently include radiotherapy , cytotoxic chemotherapy combination . Unfortunately , overall survival locally advanced disease best 50 % . Many patient residual , refractory recurrent rectal cancer experience serious morbidity local tumour invade destroy adjacent tissue include bone , nerve ( sacrum ) , bladder skin . These interfere severely normal daily activity , especially bowel function cause great distress term pain , many patient require permanent palliative colostomy . Gynaecological cancer Other advance pelvic malignancy equally problematic manage successfully . Annually UK , approximately 250 vaginal cancer , 7000 ovarian cancer , 8000 endometrial cancer 3000 cervical cancer diagnosis make , incurable time presentation . Treatment option include surgery , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy , radiotherapy combination , although palliative patient often leave debilitate symptom include severe pain fistula formation , compromise quality life . High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) method accurately deliver ablative ultrasound ( US ) generate high temperature non−invasively endo−luminally focus specific area body use image ( ultrasound MR ) guidance . Intracavitary endo−luminal ( also call transrectal ) HIFU appraise National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) treatment prostate cancer . It currently use primary prostate cancer ; also evidence may effective treat post-radiotherapy prostate cancer recurrence . Short medium term data demonstrate HIFU may equivalent current prostate cancer therapy reduce morbidity length stay . As prostate rectum adjacent natural evolution translate success prostate adjacent rectum/other pelvic structure . There large unmet clinical need new treatment patient residual progress local pelvic cancer ( rectal origin well pelvic malignancy ) current therapy exhaust . Intracavitary HIFU offer therapy . An initial cohort 20 patient offer intracavitary HIFU use Sonablate 500 ( Sonacare Medical , Charlotte , NC , USA ) intra-luminal device ( different , escalate energy dos ) general anaesthetic monitoring toxicity ablative efficacy use pre post-treatment Imaging . As none intracavitary device yet use rectal , vaginal , ovarian , endometrial , cervical pelvic lymph node tumour directly ( use rectum treat prostate cancer ) , important gauge level energy resultant cancer tissue destruction variety different treatment energy . In manner , first phase trial equivalent 'dose escalation ' phase drug trial . Once optimum energy level , safety treatment protocol know , 30 patient treated Phase II . Patients undergo MR Imaging pre− post−treatment objectively assess tumour complete quality life questionnaire , pain score , functional questionnaire . Survival data document . Post-treatment imaging perform 3-4 week , within time frame ablative effect ( necrotic area ) see prostate cancer treat HIFU , become clear provide useful data Phase I element . The trial run two stage : end first phase ( regulatory requirement ) define 30 day date last patient complete trial therapy . The non-interventional follow-up stage commence patient follow minimum 6 month death .</detailed_description>
