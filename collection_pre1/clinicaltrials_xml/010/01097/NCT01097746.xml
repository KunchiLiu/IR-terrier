	<brief_title>First-line Treatment Weekly Paclitaxel With Carboplatin Bevacizumab Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard chemotherapy newly diagnose epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer usually combination 2 chemotherapy drug call carboplatin paclitaxel . This treatment find effective , cancer often come back , require additional treatment . For study , researcher give carboplatin , bevacizumab , weekly paclitaxel see treatment effective safe treat disease . The Study Drugs : Bevacizumab design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division . Paclitaxel design block mechanism cell division cancer cell , cause die . Study Drug Administration : If choose take part study , receive 6 `` cycle '' treatment study drug . Each cycle 21 day ( 3 week ) long . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive paclitaxel carboplatin vein . Paclitaxel give first 3 hour , follow carboplatin 1 hour . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 , receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour . On Day 1 Cycles 2-6 , receive paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab vein . Paclitaxel give first 3 hour , follow carboplatin 1 hour , bevacizumab 1 ½ hour . If tolerate first dose bevacizumab well , dose bevacizumab Cycle 3 may give 60 minute . If tolerate 60 minute dose well , bevacizumab dos Cycles 4 , 5 , 6 may give 30 minute . On Days 8 15 Cycles 2-6 , receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour . Before begin treatment , receive drug dexamethasone vein help decrease risk study drug side effect . If study doctor think need , may also receive drug ( cimetidine diphenhydramine ) vein help prevent side effect nausea allergic reaction . Study Visits : Before start cycle : - Your medical history record , include list drug may take . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - A pelvic exam perform study doctor think necessary . - You ask side effect may experience . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure level CA125 . - If study doctor think necessary , CT MRI scan abdomen pelvis . Before Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , urine collect routine test . Length Study : You may remain study 6 cycle . You take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug , end-of-study visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record , include list drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement weight , vital sign , pelvic exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test measure level CA125 . - Urine collect routine test . - You CT scan MRI scan abdomen pelvis . - If study doctor think necessary , chest x-ray and/or ECG . Long-Term Follow-Up : After end-of-study visit , long-term follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record , include list drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement weight , vital sign , pelvic exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test measure level CA125 . - Urine collect routine test . - You CT scan MRI scan abdomen pelvis . - If study doctor think necessary , chest x-ray and/or ECG . If unable come M. D. Anderson long-term follow-up visit , researcher call phone every 3 month 2 year ask question . Your doctor tell standard test procedure need perform . The phone call last 10 minute time . This investigational study . Bevacizumab , carboplatin , paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment many type cancer . The combination carboplatin paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . At time , addition bevacizumab combination carboplatin paclitaxel FDA approve use research . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
