	<brief_summary>Loss-of-function mutation gene encode CYP450 2C19 enzyme emerge likely determinant resistance clopidogrel therapy . The primary hypothesis propose research among patient confirm loss-of-function allele CYP2C19 gene , increase maintenance clopidogrel dose 75 150 mg result significant reduction rate measure clopidogrel resistance define multiple measure platelet function</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first phase clinical trial involve subject recruitment inform consent genetic testing . Because target population patient stable coronary artery disease , patient recruit outpatient set clinic visit time outpatient cardiac catheterization . It expect potential candidate initially screen eligibility treat cardiologist . If patient agree undergo formal screening , approached member research team receive write summary clinical trial protocol review trial personnel . The initial informed consent allow patient undergo genetic test baseline VerifyNow assay , also give trial personnel permission contact patient phone find eligible interventional phase trial . The goal enrollment genetic test portion clinical trial 200 patient . If genetic test result confirm patient candidate interventional study , contact asked make outpatient appointment initiate interventional study protocol . The therapeutic portion study randomize , unblinded cross-over comparison two clopidogrel dose strategy . It anticipate eligible patient continue previous chronic clopidogrel therapy standard dose 75 mg/day . Because patient receive chronic clopidogrel initiation intervention protocol , steady state level present patient . Dose dependent inhibition platelet aggregation see two hour single oral dose clopidogrel . Repeated dose 75mg daily produce steady state inhibition day 3 day 7 administration . Patients agree participate therapeutic protocol , meet eligibility criterion , randomize initial dose strategy 75 150 mg daily minimum 30 day . At day 30 ( +/- 5 day ) , patient return repeat platelet function test . In randomly select subset 15 patient , blood test active metabolite clopidogrel . At time , crossover patient receive 75 mg qD increase 150 mg qD receive 150 mg qD decrease 75 mg qD . At day 60 ( +/- 5 day ) , participant return comprehensive platelet function test second randomly select group patient undergo test clopidogrel metabolite . Chronic clopidogrel dose reduce 75mg participant . Please see attached schedule event summary trial schedule .</detailed_description>
