	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A virus call Seneca Valley virus-001 ( NTX-010 ) may able kill tumor cell without damage normal cell . It yet know whether NTX-010 effective placebo treat small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study NTX-010 see well work compare placebo give chemotherapy treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seneca Valley Virus-001 After Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer treat Seneca Valley virus-001 ( NTX-010 ) v placebo . Secondary - To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient treat NTX-010 v placebo . - To describe adverse event profile safety NTX-010 patient population . - To determine antitumor response rate , assess RECIST criterion , duration tumor response patient population . - To assess quality life patient population . Exploratory - To determine relationship presence neutralize antibody PFS . - To assess whether slow viral clearance associate well response determine PFS . - To determine potential impact presence one several neuroendocrine marker tumor sample ( synaptophysin , chromogranin , CD56 ) PFS OS . - To determine potential relationship presence cell surface determinants NTX-010 tropism tumor tissue clinical outcome improve PFS OS . - To determine potential relationship loss integrity IFN signal tumor tissue clinical outcome improve PFS OS . - To assess whether presence circulate tumor cell permissive NTX-010 associate well clinical outcome determine PFS OS . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , tumor response standard chemotherapy ( partial response v stable disease vs complete response ) , time completion chemotherapy randomization 1 month ( ≤1 month ) vs 2 month ( &gt; 1 month ≤ 2 month ) vs 3 month ( &gt; 2 month ≤ 3 month ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive single dose Seneca Valley virus-001 ( NTX-010 ) IV 1 hour day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive single dose placebo IV 1 hour day 1 . In arm , patient may also undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) daily day 22-35 previously undergone PCI whole-brain radiotherapy . Quality life assess baseline periodically study . Blood sample collect periodically viral clearance antiviral neutralize antibody level , circulate tumor cell , biomarker laboratory study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
