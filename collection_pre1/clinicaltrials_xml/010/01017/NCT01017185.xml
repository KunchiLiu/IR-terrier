	<brief_title>Study HF10 Patients With Refractory Head Neck Cancer Solid Tumors With Cutaneous and/or Superficial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , non-randomized , multicenter , two-stage , dose escalation Phase I study evaluate single repeat intratumoral injection oncolytic virus , HF10 , patient refractory head neck cancer , solid tumor cutaneous and/or superficial lesion ( e.g. , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma breast , malignant melanoma ) . Stage 1 : Stage 1 study investigate dose escalation single intratumoral injection follow dose level : 1 x 10^5 TCID50 , 3 x 10^5 TCID50 , 1 x 10^6 TCID50 , 1 x 10^7 TCID50 . In Stage 1 , plan 3 patient enrol per single dose cohort . Within single dose cohort , accrual temporarily suspend first patient enter patient follow safety viral distribution elimination . The patient Stage 1 must seropositive HSV-1 . Stage 2 : Stage 2 evaluate repeat intratumoral injection HF10 dose level 1 x 10^6 TCID50/dose 1 x 10^7 TCID50/dose . Three patient enrol repeat dose cohort . In Stage 2 , first patient treat repeat dose cohort must seropositive HSV-1 . Patients repeat dose cohort receive total four intratumoral injection lesion . Following completion dose repeat dose cohort , expansion cohort three additional patient treat high tolerate dose level .</detailed_description>
