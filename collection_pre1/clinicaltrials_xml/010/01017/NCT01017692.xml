	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Interpretations Lumbar Spinal Stenosis ( LSS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) become gold standard evaluation lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS . LSS define narrow spinal canal . Thus far , formal grading system literature . Physicians , particularly radiologist , interpretation , currently describe degree stenosis level normal , mild , moderate severe . Unfortunately , consensus criterion definition . Treatments surgical plan base primarily information . Consequently , reliability accuracy information critical term optimize outcome . In study 50-100 MRI study patient diagnose symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis collect , de-identified , assign study identification number track purpose . Three `` raters '' Upstate three `` rater '' outside institution , experience review MRI 's ask review MRI 's classify LSS lumbar level normal , mild , moderate severe central canal , lateral recess neuroforamen . The raters information patient . The MRI 's give new identification number , patient 's self-assessment questionnaire ( also de-identified give study id number ) give raters , second review . The raters patient gender , age outcome score Short form 36 , Visual Analog Scale , Oswestry Disability Index Zurich Claudication Questionnaires . The raters classify MRI , normal , mild , moderate severe use outcomes information supply . The data rating compile compare assess reliability radiologically establish anatomical stenosis compare subject outcome score . This study current patient Upstate Orthopedics office .</detailed_description>
