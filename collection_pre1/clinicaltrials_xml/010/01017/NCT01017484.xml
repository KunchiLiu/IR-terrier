	<brief_title>Mechanism Blood Pressure Lowering Effect DASH Dietary Pattern</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized , control feeding trial establish BP lower effect Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) dietary pattern , emphasize fruit , vegetable low fat dairy low saturate total fat . The DASH study design establish efficacy , determine mechanism action . Other study suggest DASH diet may effect renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . These effect directly evaluate , potential mechanism action effect adrenergic tone , vascular function inflammation . The BP-lowering effect DASH dietary pattern maximal two week control feeding , comparable magnitude antihypertensive medication among participant stage 1 hypertension . Understanding possible mechanism ( ) DASH diet lower BP potentially enhance value intervention elucidate condition effective , identify target population , examine impact vascular health beyond BP , enhance understanding interaction among diet , BP vascular function . In addition , result study may help identify additional therapeutic target . Therefore , overall goal propose study determine mechanism ( ) DASH diet lower BP . Our unifying hypothesis DASH diet lower BP effect vascular function sodium excretion , mediate effect RAAS .</detailed_description>
