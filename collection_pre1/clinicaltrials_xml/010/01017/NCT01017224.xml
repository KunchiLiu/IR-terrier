	<brief_summary>Solid tumour contain vary degree hypoxia . Studies show hypoxia associate poor local control survival , hypoxia cause resistance radio- chemotherapy development aggressive tumour . Previous attempt measure hypoxia bias technique invasive , repeatable difficult apply routine basis . There great interest try measure hypoxia tumour could lead individualized hypoxia-modifying therapy prediction treatment response . Additionally investigator ' knowledge change hypoxia time limited , great interest individualise treatment , intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) emerge . 18F-FAZA , appear promise . It nitroimidazole , get trap hypoxic cell detect positron emission therapy ( PET ) scan . Compared nitroimidazoles , 18F-FAZA superior biokinetics thereby believe provide fast clearer image hypoxia . The investigator ' hypothesis 18F-FAZA use prognostic marker HNSCC .</brief_summary>
