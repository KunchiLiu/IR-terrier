	<detailed_description>Introduction : Administration radiographic contrast agent often result reversible acute reduction renal function begin soon contrast dye administration . The incidence contrast induce nephropathy varies 5 % 50 % depend patient ' population criterion contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) , definition use consider one leading cause hospital acquire acute renal failure . The pathogenesis contrast-induced nephropathy uncertain . There two main theory . According first one possible influence renal hemodynamics , mainly vasoconstriction , result medullary ischemia possibly mediate alteration endothelin adenosine . In addition direct vasoconstriction renal vessel , iodinate contrast agent also block important pathway vasodilation autoregulation possibly reduce production nitric oxide . And accord main theory contrast agent exert direct toxic effect tubular epithelial cell . It seem reactive oxygen specie role CIN . A lot study examine incidence contrast agent-associated nephrotoxicity mainly stable patient undergo elective radiographic procedure . Numerous agent examine ability prevent contrast-induced decrease renal function . Among use low-osmolarity , non anionic contrast agent , prophylactic hydration reduce incidence CIN . Administration drug calcium antagonist , theophyllin , dopamine atrial natriuretic peptide prevent CIN . In study antioxidant agent like acetylcysteine ascorbic acid seem reduce incidence CIN . Critically ill patient represent absolutely discrete group may acute decrease renal function , multiple organ failure often receive multiple potentially nephrotoxic agent like antibiotic , vasoconstrictive , NSAIDs etc . Critically ill patient frequently require radiographic study contrast agent administration order improve diagnostic accuracy detection abscess , diagnosis suspect embolism . Radiographic study often do emergent urgent basis enough time patient receive prophylactic regiment . Despite improvement supportive care , acute renal failure increase morbidity mortality rate critically ill patient . We think important initially investigate incidence CIN critically ill patient fact establish ( one retrospective cohort study ) see impact combination prophylactic strategy population . The ability prevent CIN high risk patient result significant public health benefit reduce in-hospital mortality , hospital stay need dialysis subsequent devastate cost hospitalization . N-acetylcysteine reduce thiol , potent antioxidant may scavenge wide variety oxygen derive free radical . Ascorbic acid potent antioxidant capable scavenge wide array reactive oxygen specie additionally regenerate antioxidant . Acetylcysteine ascorbic acid inexpensive treatment generally mild adverse effect . Material method : This study represent prospective randomize open label control trial . The study take place intensive care unit University Hospital Larissa . Consecutive sample use recruit patient hospitalize ICU department October 2009 October 2010 . The patient undergo radiographic study administration contrast agent randomly assign receive IV either 1200mg acetylcysteine 2g ascorbic acid placebo least 2 hour start index procedure , follow 1200mg acetylcysteine 1,5g ascorbic acid placebo night morning examination . All patient independently randomization receive hydration least 100ml/h IV 0,9 % 0,45 % sodium chloride water , randomization least 6 hour examination . The variation hydration type rate allow adjustment accord special need every patient . An acute contrast induced reduction renal function define increase serum creatinine concentration least 0,5mg/dl 72 hour injection radiocontrast medium relative rise least 25 % fro baseline . Baseline serum creatinine urea concentration measure blood sample drawn time randomization , follow-up serum urea creatinine concentration measure 1st , 2nd 3rd day examination . At time interval study renal function use sensitive test like serum cystatin serum lipocalin ( NGAL ) . We also examine plasma total antioxidant status blood urine sample draw time randomization begin procedure follow morning . The daily urine output also register day study three subsequent day . Authorization give Scientific Council Ethical Committee hospital . Clinical biochemical characteristic study patient include demographic data , diagnosis admission ICU , APACHE II score admission randomization , medical history presence cardiac insufficiency , hypertension , coronary disease , hepatic insufficiency , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , nephrotoxic medication patient receive like antibiotic , NSAID , chemotherapeutic agent , diuretic , inotropic vasopressor agent , ACE inhibitor , calcium antagonist , mechanical ventilation ICU , ICU length stay , ICU outcome , need renal replacement therapy , quantity receive radiocontrast agent route administration . Statistical analysis . All analysis perform intention-to-treat basis probability value 2-sided . Data present mean +/- SD 95 % CI continuous variable percentage discrete variable . Analysis perform use statistical software , SISS 15 Windows . Data compare two group . Characteristics compare use x2 test t-test .</detailed_description>
