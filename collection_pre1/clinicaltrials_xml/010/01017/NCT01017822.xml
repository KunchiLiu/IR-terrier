	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , conatumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy may use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving conatumumab together gemcitabine hydrochloride , capecitabine , radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose conatumumab give together gemcitabine hydrochloride , capecitabine , radiation therapy see well work treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate maximum tolerate dose conatumumab target dose 10 mg/kg give concurrently capecitabine radiotherapy follow induction therapy comprise conatumumab gemcitabine hydrochloride patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . ( Phase I ) - To evaluate overall survival patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To evaluate safety profile patient treat regimen . ( Phase I II ) - To evaluate progression-free survival patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - To evaluate primary tumor response rate patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - To generate translational research hypothesis . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study conatumumab , follow phase II study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive conatumumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 15 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . - Conatumumab chemoradiotherapy : Beginning 14-42 day last course induction therapy , patient undergo 3-dimensional radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 5½ week ( 28 treatment ) . Patients also receive conatumumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 oral capecitabine twice daily , 5 day week , 5½ week . - Maintenance therapy : Beginning 28-56 day completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive conatumumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 15 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
