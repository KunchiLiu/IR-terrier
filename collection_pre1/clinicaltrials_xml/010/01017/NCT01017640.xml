	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose veliparib give without mitomycin C treat patient solid tumor spread place body , remove surgery come back . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , mitomycin C , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving veliparib together mitomycin C may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib With Without Mitomycin C Treating Patients With Metastatic , Unresectable , Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To screen cancer patient across different histological site identify functional defect Fanconi anemia ( FA ) pathway tumor . II . To establish safety practicality treat patient FA deficient tumor poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor ABT-888 ( veliparib ) protract monotherapy . III . To establish safety practicality treat patient FA deficient tumor combination mitomycin C ( MMC ) ABT-888 . IV . To select dose ABT-888 protract monotherapy dose-schedule combination mitomycin C ABT-888 patient FA deficient tumor phase 2 trial . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate germ-line FA repair deficiency BRCA mutation peripheral blood mononuclear ( PBMC ) patient receive ABT-888 treatment . II . To evaluate PBMC sample foci produce histone variant gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( H2AX ) patient receive mitomycin C without ABT-888 order ass possible effect ABT-888 cellular sense process mitomycin C-induced deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) double strand break . III . Quantify number patient antitumor response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-7 , 1-14 , 1-21 . Patients also receive mitomycin C intravenously ( IV ) 10-20 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
