	<brief_title>A Study Gemcitabine Adjuvant Treatment Cholangiocarcinoma After Surgical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholangiocarcinoma highly fatal disease poor prognosis . While Cholangiocarcinoma generally rare Western country , common Korea , estimate 3500 case diagnose annually . Currently , surgical resection remain potentially curative treatment , many patient develop recurrence . Thus , effective postoperative adjuvant therapy require prolong survival patient cholangiocarcinoma . However , standard postoperative treatment establish yet . Among several different new anticancer drug currently investigate treatment advance biliary tract cancer , gemcitabine generate particular interest . The nucleoside analogue gemcitabine report active advanced unresectable cholangiocarcinoma include cancer gallbladder , intrahepatic , extrahepatic bile duct . So expected investigated adjuvant setting .</detailed_description>
