	<brief_summary>Patients receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) usually undergo test end ICD procedure measure amount energy able successfully defibrillate heart ( defibrillation threshold test , DFT ) . This study propose perform measurement pediatric patient already undergo clinically necessary ICD procedure , measurement perform use binary search method previously validate adult cohort . We hypothesize pediatric DFTs , precisely measure , may lower previously assume extrapolation adult data .</brief_summary>
