	<brief_title>Non-malarial Febrile Illness Children Areas Perennial Malaria Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until recently , national global malaria control authority recommend clinical diagnosis—based solely presence history fever—for malaria treatment setting sub-Saharan Africa malaria transmission sustain intense . To extent recommendation base fact conventional antimalarial treatment like chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) relatively affordable safe microscopic diagnosis complex difficult maintain remote rural setting . It economically advantageous logistically feasible treat potential case malaria extend microscopic diagnosis every level health system . This approach result extensive over-treatment , particularly among old child adult , may contribute rapid development antimalarial drug resistance . Although much write recently cost-effectiveness expand malaria diagnosis , available information scarce number important reason clinical diagnosis recommend long , especially among child live high transmission setting . First , uncomplicated malaria progress severe fatal illness within 24 48 hour onset . Numerous care-seeking study demonstrate caretaker seldom arrive formal health facility within 24 48 hour onset uncomplicated febrile illness . If diagnostic test impose additional barriers—such cost , time delay , referral—requiring positive parasitological diagnosis could put child whose cause fever malaria infection great risk progress severe fatal illness . Second , although current approach base clinical diagnosis appear result substantial over-treatment , still possible demonstrate child live malaria transmission area benefit additional schedule dose antimalarial treatment , even ill. For example , meta-analysis six trial sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) give child routine immunization visit demonstrate average decrease 30 % episodes clinical malaria , 15 % anemia , 24 % all-cause hospital admission among child receive SP compare child receive drug visit . Finally , provider client may incline disregard negative blood slide RDT , especially situation identify additional treatable cause illness . Withholding antimalarial treatment child might adversely affect provider client satisfaction poor client satisfaction may reduce subsequent health facility utilization . It might also encourage disappointed client seek treatment private sector broad range antimalarial drugs—most single drug treatment contribute development resistance recommend national treatment policy—can obtain without diagnostic confirmation . We propose longitudinal cohort study evaluate identifiable cause treatable fever among 1000 malaria-negative child present outpatient health clinic Miono , Bagamoyo District , Tanzania use variety clinical , microbiological serologic method . In addition intend follow 1000 malaria-negative child 91 day next malaria infection assess clinical progress need malaria treatment . To compare relative benefit provide antimalarial treatment even malaria-negative child , half participant randomize receive first-line treatment malaria currently recommend ; half receive treatment identify illness . Alternative Hypothesis : Febrile , parasite-negative child treat malaria well clinical longitudinal outcome ( measure prevalence anemia end follow period , reticulocyte count repeat visit health facility , hospitalization , time next infection malaria parasite ) febrile , parasite-negative child treat malaria area high transmission .</detailed_description>
