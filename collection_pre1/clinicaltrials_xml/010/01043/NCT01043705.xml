	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare incidence cardiac implantable electronic device ( CIED ) infection CIED mechanical complication CIED replacement high-power cardiac implantable electronic device ; either cardiac resynchronization therapy device ( CRT ) , implantable cardioverter defibrilator ( ICD ) TYRX Anti-Bacterial Envelope ( formerly know `` AIGISRx '' ) , incidence , replacement ICD CRT TYRX .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TYRX™ Envelope Prevention Infection Following Replacement With CRT ICD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac implantable electronic device ( CIED ) infection associate significant morbidity expense . The frequency CIED infection increase faster frequency CIED implant , suggest effective prophylactic strategy need . The TYRX Anti-Bacterial Envelope FDA-cleared polypropylene mesh intend securely hold pacemaker pulse generator defibrillator ( ICD ) order create stable environment implant body . It contain antimicrobial agent , rifampin minocycline , show reduce infection vivo model bacterial contamination follow surgical implant generator defibrillator . This prospective , observational , multicenter registry subject undergo CIED replacement ICD CRT TYRX , without lead revision/addition . The registry subject compare published historical control group undergo CIED replacement ICD CRT TYRX , without lead revision/addition . The CRT registry subject also compare case-matched retrospective control group undergo CIED replacement CRT TYRX , without lead revision/addition . The primary study endpoint major CIED infection CIED mechanical complication 12 month follow CIED replacement ICD CRT . Originally execute two separate study ( Citadel - ICDs ) ( Centurion - CRTs ) , protocol amendment execute 2012 due slow enrollment , combine database analysis result .</detailed_description>
