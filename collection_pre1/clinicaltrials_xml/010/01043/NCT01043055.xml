	<brief_title>Evaluation Diagnostic Ability Cancer Detection Technology ( CDT ) Detect Breast Cancer Among Women Population Over Age 40</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer diagnosis rapidly expand research field , whose early-stage detection may reduce burden disease permit effective treatment . It well document tumor growth require specific condition development occurrence mutation clinically detectable cancer . It show live peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) different ability cytosolic enzyme ( esterases ) convert hydrophobic substrate fluorescein diacetate ( FDA ) hydrophilic fluorescent fluorescein . It depend PBMC cycle stage , size , surface state , physiological state , activation apoptosis . The important step breast cancer genesis early change functional activity cytosolic enzyme ( esterases ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell . Such transformation PBMC may detect accurately exist device Flowcytometer ( FACS™ MultiSET™ System , company `` Becton Dickinson '' GmbH , USA ) , measurement fluorescence polarization enzymatic hydrolysis FDA substrate record . A conclusion presentation breast cancer among examined woman achieve `` CDT '' ( cancer detection technology ) software , analyze mathematically result fluorescence polarization enzymatic hydrolysis . Moreover , combine biochemical model together additional prognostic parameter ( age , ethnic group , gynecological obstetric anamnesis ) increase validity ( accuracy , sensitivity specificity ) diagnostic conclusion . Diagnostic Solution CDT : 1 . Mathematical processing specific blood analysis device Flowcytometer . 2 . Mathematical evaluation specific prognostic parameter</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Breast Cancer Patients Experimental Group : 1 . Patient age 40 . 2 . Patient willing participate evidence sign write informed consent form . 3 . Patient refer Department Oncology/ Surgery operative treatment breast cancer previously detect disease . Positive conventional test find include ( limited ) record screen diagnostic mammography , blood oncomarkers , breast ultrasound , breast CT , biopsy . 4 . Nontreated patient ( w/o previous chemotherapy , hormonal drug radiotherapy ) . 5 . Patient without cancer location Inclusion Criteria Presumably Healthy Subjects Control Group : 1 . Subjects age 40 . 2 . Subjects willing participate evidence sign write informed consent form . 3 . Subjects presumably healthy without breast pathology ' symptom family history breast cancer , i.e. , breast disease ( except history functional breast problem , e.g. , mastitis within lactation period ) rule base physician anamnesis 4 . Subjects negative result screen mammography . 5 . Subjects without take hormonal medicine 1 . Subjects know cancer internal organ system . 2 . Subjects high fever presentation ( 38.5 ) . 3 . Subjects know breast disease undergo treatment disease . 4 . Pregnant lactating woman</criteria>
