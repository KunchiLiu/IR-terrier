	<brief_title>Evaluation Insecticide Treated Nets Wall Liners Prevention Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insecticide treat net ( ITNs ) show reduce malaria relate morbidity mortality increasingly scale throughout sub-Saharan Africa . However , ITNs alone unlikely reduce transmission zero setting additional vector control tool necessary . One new promise strategy use insecticide treat wall liner ( ITWLs ) . These textile treat insecticide use line inner wall house . The wall liner consider long-lasting alternative indoor residual spraying also use malaria vector control expensive implement . Within 6 pair village , plan randomly allocate one village pair receive either ITNs ITNs plus ITWLs . Households randomly select village child age 6 month 11 year enrol cohort study . The child clear exist infection follow monthly found infect malaria . The study last 6 month demonstrate whether ITWLs provide additional protection malaria provide use ITNs .</detailed_description>
