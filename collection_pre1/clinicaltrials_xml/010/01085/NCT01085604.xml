	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine trunk neuromuscular control strategy change therapeutic exercise emphasize core stabilization . Hypothesis : subject low back pain demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement function pain significantly improve trunk motor control strategy . Hypothesis : measure trunk control demonstrate 'construct-validity ' . This test use know group method demonstrating : - significant change motor control measure within untreated , healthy control group . - significant change within low back subject demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence suggest poor neuromuscular control lumbopelvic region important find large number patient recurrent chronic low back pain may play role recurrence symptom . Despite finding alter trunk motor control individual low back pain , neuromuscular strategy underlie alteration satisfactorily characterize . The aim study ( 1 ) identify neural control strategy alter follow rehabilitation program emphasize trunk control stability use motor learn approach ( 2 ) provide preliminary evidence link hypothesize mechanism effectiveness program design improve trunk control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion healthy control : No history low back define : 1. pain limiting performance daily activity great 3 day , 2. pain seek medical ally health intervention . Inclusion Criteria individual history low back pain : 1. duration current episode low back pain le 3 month , 2. average pain intensity past 2 week least 3 11 point ( 0 = pain , 10 = worst pain ever ) numeric pain rating scale , 3. medical intervention low back pain last 6 month , 4 . Oswestry disability score great 20 % 5. physical therapy diagnosis clinical lumbar instability base upon specific examination finding . Exclusion Criteria group : 1. permanent structural spinal deformity ( e.g. , scoliosis ) 2. history spinal fracture diagnosis osteoporosis 3. diagnosis inflammatory joint disease 4. sign systemic illness suspect nonmechanical LBP ( i.e . spinal tumor infection ) 5. previous spinal surgery 6. frank neurological loss , i.e. , weakness sensory loss 7. history neurologic disease require hospitalization , 8. active treatment another medical illness would preclude participation aspect study low extremity injury would potentially alter trunk movement stand 9. leg length discrepancy great 2.5 cm . 10. pregnancy 11. vestibular dysfunction</criteria>
