	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) inherit blood disorder cause red blood cell change shape round shape half-moon/crescent sickled shape . People SCD different type protein carry oxygen blood ( hemoglobin ) people without SCD . This different type hemoglobin make red blood cell change crescent shape certain condition . Sickle-shaped cell problem often get stuck blood vessel block flow blood , cause inflammation injury important area body . Lexiscan drug may prevent inflammation injury cause sickle shape cell . This drug approve FDA use fast infusion heart stress test people unable exercise enough put stress heart make beat faster . Lexiscan never study patient SCD never give long infusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- In research study look high dose Lexiscan give safely patient SCD . There 4 stage study . Each stage look high dose give safely follow situation : Stage 1 : Lexiscan give 12 hour infusion adult SCD pain crisis . Stage 2 : Lexiscan give 24 hour infusion adult SCD pain crisis . Stage 2b : Lexiscan give 48 hour infusion adult SCD pain crisis . Stage 3 : Lexiscan give 24 hour infusion adult SCD pain crisis . Stage 4 : Lexiscan give 24 hour infusion child SCD pain crisis . Stages 1-3 complete close accrual . The study open child age 10-17 SCD pain crisis ( stage 4 ) . - When participant sign consent form , tell stage join . - Participants Stages 1 , 2 , 2b give infusion study drug time pain crisis . The infusion Stage 1 participant 12 hour long , follow 6-hour observation period . The infusion Stage 2 24 hour long , follow 6-hour observation period . The infusion Stage 2b 48 hour long , follow 6-hour observation period . - Participants Stages 3 4 give one infusion study drug admit hospital pain crisis . The infusion 24 hour long , follow 6-hour observation period . During infusion , receive standard treatment pain crisis . - Before infusion follow procedure perform : Pulmonary function test ( optional , Stage 1 ) , blood test vital sign . - During infusion follow procedure perform : heart rate amount oxygen blood monitor continuously , blood test blood pressure . - During observation period immediately follow infusion follow procedure perform : heart rate amount oxygen blood monitor continuously , blood test , blood pressure Pulmonary Function test ( optional , Stage 1 ) .</detailed_description>
