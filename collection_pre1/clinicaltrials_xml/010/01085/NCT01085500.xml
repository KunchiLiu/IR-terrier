	<brief_summary>Abstract : Minimally invasive technique ubiquitous management surgical disease . Competence laparoscopy require specialized training practice . With decrease resident work hour , train program need explore adopt efficient strategy teach evaluate laparoscopic skill . For economic , ethical , legal consideration , operate room may longer ideal environment teach basic technical skill . There appear role simulation response need . The transfer laparoscopic skill learn simulated environment operating room show mixed result . Overall , seem surgical skill train outside operating room beneficial , best method ( ) designing , implement evaluate skill curriculum yet identify . The laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal ( TEP ) inguinal hernia repair example procedure associate steep learning curve require mastery basic laparoscopic skill . In addition , increase recurrence complication rate early learn curve procedure , underscore importance adequate training . The current practice teach TEP repair operate room apprenticeship-based model associate increase operative time cost . We propose train surgical trainee outside operating room structure , mastery orient simulation-based curriculum help reduce learn curve TEP repair , improve operative performance , decrease operative time cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Inguinal hernia common ailment general population . Their surgical management laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal ( TEP ) approach show lead less discomfort faster recovery classic open repair equal effectiveness . Nonetheless , TEP repair adopt widely concern regard substantial learn curve . In addition , current practice teach TEP procedure operate room apprenticeship-based model associate increase operative time cost . The training surgeon laparoscopic skill outside operating room simulation-based strategy emerge attractive alternative . Many study demonstrate trainee practice laparoscopic skill simulate environment show improvement skill test environment . Few study however , able demonstrate direct correlation simulation training improve performance operating room . It appear study surgical skill train outside operating room beneficial , best method yet identify . Our long-term research goal explore adopt efficient simulation-based strategy teach evaluate surgical skill surgical trainee . Our objective study design evaluate simulation-based curriculum base upon concept mastery learn theory ( achievement pre-specified expert-derived benchmark without time constraint ) develop objective mean assess operative performance aid shorten learn curve TEP inguinal hernia repair surgical trainee . Our central hypothesis training surgery resident outside operative room simulation-based strategy , TEP mastery learn curriculum improve operative performance reduce operative time TEP repair . The rationale study identification effective strategy shorten learn curve TEP repair translate decrease operative time increase adoption TEP repair inherent benefit candidate patient , also lead substantial cost-savings perhaps improve patient outcome . We especially well prepared complete study part academic referral center treat myriad inguinal hernia patient educate hundred surgical resident continuous basis . Specific Aim 1 : To compare TEP mastery learn curriculum apprenticeship-based model learn TEP repair operative room operative time operative performance TEP inguinal hernia repair perform surgical trainee . Hypothesis 1a : Surgical trainee undergo TEP mastery learn curriculum achieve less mean operative time perform TEP inguinal hernia repair compare follow apprenticeship-based model . Hypothesis 1b : Surgical trainee undergo TEP mastery learn curriculum achieve great mean operative performance score perform TEP inguinal hernia repair compare follow apprenticeship-based model . Secondary Aim : Compare rate TEP inguinal hernia repair post-operative complication , specifically urinary retention patient operate surgical resident underwent mastery learn curriculum versus underwent apprenticeship-based model . This research innovative challenge current paradigm teach basic laparoscopic skill operative room strive link surgical education method objective patient level outcomes operative time cost . At completion project , expectation well prepared continue effort translate new educational modalities/technologies improve delivery healthcare . Our anticipated finding relevant impact educate surgeon tomorrow .</detailed_description>
