	<brief_title>Erlotinib Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I-II multicenter , open label , sequential cohort dose escalation study erlotinib design assess safety efficacy daily administration erlotinib high risk MDS patient . Five patient per cohort enrol sequential cohort receive increase dosage erlotinib . The first cohort 5 patient start dosage 100 mg erlotinib daily . Response determine 12 week treatment ( earlier upon major hematologic improvement , whichever event occur first ) . At completion cohort , define fifth subject complete week 12 visit , safety review panel responsible make decision whether next cohort begin , intermediate dose cohort add , additional subject enrol earlier dose cohort . Upon agreement safety review panel , second cohort patient receive 150 mg erlotinib daily , - upon agreement safety review panel - third cohort five patient enrol receive 300 mg erlotinib daily . Since expect therapeutically required dosage erlotinib high dosage patient initially enrol ( i.e . patient enrol first cohort receive 100 mg daily ) , dosage erlotinib increase ( patient ) next high level , response document 12 week continuous treatment grade III IV toxicity document . In contrast , responder continue treatment dosage erlotinib grade III IV toxicity arise treatment loses efficacy ( define relapse/progression disease ) . Consequently , study plan enrol 15 patient 3 cohort 5 patient . Once dose limit toxicity define , additional confirmatory subject ( 20 ) enrol appropriate low dose recommend safety review panel .</detailed_description>
