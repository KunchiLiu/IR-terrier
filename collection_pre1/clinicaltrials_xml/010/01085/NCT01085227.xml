	<brief_summary>Besides Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , exist rare parkinsonian syndrome clinically close PD correspond Mendelian entity . Autosomal dominant form mainly associate mutation alpha synuclein LRRK2/dardarin gene , whereas autosomal recessive form due mutation Parkin , Pink1 DJ-1 gene . This entity still unknown clinical , genetic metabolic `` au plan `` . Throughout national network 15 specialized centre movement disorder , coordinate team neurogenetics reference centre Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital ( Alexis Brice ) , propose precise relative frequency , molecular base abnormality functional neuroimaging associate LRRK2 gene mutation , frequently implicate autosomal dominant form . Due relative rarity parkinsonian syndrome , perform time retrospective study case family already collect national network ( 300 isolate case 300 family ) prospective study . The network recruit 100 isolated case 40 familial case yearly , precise diagnosis tool . The genetic analysis evaluate relative frequency LRRK2 mutation spectrum French population . Phenotype-genotype correlation perform well orientate molecular diagnosis , order improve genetic counselling reduce cost analysis . In case LRRK2 mutation , genetic investigation propose family , specific care at-risk case . A detailed phenotypic evaluation patient at-risk case propose ( neurological , neuropsychiatric behavioural ) CIC Pitié-Salpêtrière also image , 15 patient 40 relative ( 20 carrier 20 non-carriers LRRK2 mutation ) . The TEP study evaluate dopaminergic function ( fluorodopa capture ) measure dopamine transporter ( DAT ) . The structural MRI evaluation search possible associate structural morphologic abnormality . The functional MRI evaluation search dysfunction motor circuit movement realisation . These examination perform two year interval appreciate evolution disease . This study allow good characterize parkinsonian syndrome due LRRK2 mutation also well characterize presymptomatic phase , subject controversy idiopathic PD . The feasibility project assure expertise collaborative centre inclusion retrospective cohort , combine prospective cohort , allow recruit sufficient patient at-risk relative rare genetic entity .</brief_summary>
