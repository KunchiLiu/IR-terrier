	<brief_title>Oxygen Saturation Alarms Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>False alarm may particularly prevalent neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) uncontrolled motion infant intensify problem . The performance pulse oximeter particular importance NICU danger hyperoxemia hypoxemia pose newborn ; hyperoxemia lead chronic lung disease retinopathy prematurity , hypoxemia depresses spontaneous ventilation . High false alarm rate contribute problem noise NICU . They also potential endanger patient clinicians become inured continual alarm ignore may clinically relevant . There study utility pulse oximeter alarm NICU , particularly new-generation technology . This study build small body exist literature alarm rate new-generation pulse oximeter neonate provide detail relationship alarm clinical intervention . This observational study 50 infant three hospital United States . The observer experience nurse comprehensive training ensure consistency . The infant clinical staff observe four hour continuously . Observers note time alarm , response , interrupted clinical staff activity , clinical intervention , time intervention . Clinical staff also question whether alarm consistent desaturation event . Infant characteristic may affect frequency alarm . Data collect include age , gender , weight , ethnicity , diagnosis , medication . This study evaluate proportion nuisance alarm relative proportion clinically relevant alarm . It also evaluate difference alarm frequency across infant characteristic characterize nurse activity interrupt alarm .</detailed_description>
