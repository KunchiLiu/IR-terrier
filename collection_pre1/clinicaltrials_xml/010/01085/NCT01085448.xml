	<brief_summary>The aim study determine assessment additional measure trunk neuromuscular control improve ability identify patient low back pain successfully respond trunk stabilization exercise . Question : What clinical characteristic associated patient respond positively program core stabilization exercise ? Hypothesis : Clinical characteristic show decrease trunk motor control associate positive response stabilization exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical identification individual mechanical low back pain would benefit program stabilization exercise struggle physical therapy profession . While change trunk muscle recruitment motor control link patient chronic low back pain hypothesize adaptation spinal instability , systematically establish . However , connection spinal instability , poor trunk motor control , low back pain plausible . The real problem lie clinical identification subgroup patient either acute chronic phase low back dysfunction would benefit approach intervention . In create preliminary clinical prediction rule , Hicks et al ( 2005 ) , look many variable include patient demographic characteristic , hip trunk motion , special test instability , functional measure muscle performance . However , measure performance core stabilizing muscle assessment trunk dynamic control/ coordination include potential variable . The aim study determine assessment additional measure trunk neuromuscular control improve ability identify patient low back pain successfully respond trunk stabilization exercise .</detailed_description>
