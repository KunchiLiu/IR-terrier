	<detailed_description>Conventional intestinal manometry current gold standard evaluation intestinal motility1,2,3,11 , identifies pattern intestinal dysmotility4,8,9 . However intestinal manometry involve intestinal intubation consequent discomfort patient . Furthermore , require considerable technical expertise knowledge interpretation data . Hence , date method limit indication restrict referral center around world6,7,10,13 . Vall d'Hebron Hospital , collaboration CVC ( Barcelona , Spain ) recently develop minimally invasive method evaluation intestinal motility base endoluminal image analysis use endoscopic PillCam capsule . In contrast manometry , technique minimally invasive , technical aspect simple , analysis perform fully automate computer program . Both technical procedure test endoluminal image analysis program develop multidisciplinary medical-engineering team Autonomous University Barcelona past 5 year . The technique validate group patient intestinal dysmotility healthy subject , demonstrate 90 % sensitivity specificity . In brief , technique work follow . In study series feature analyze : contractile pattern ( contraction evaluate diaphragmatic occlusion lumen presence radial wrinkle pattern ) , non contractile pattern ( wall tunnel pattern ) , luminal content ( turbid pattern ) , endoluminal motion , capsule displacement . The program base automate learn method ( machine learning technique ) . Data patient healthy subject use training set . Based data , program develop function best discriminate group . The performance system validate use leave-one-out method use one training set evaluate left-out example . This technique need validated large multinational population . Using expanded pool study learn set , robust discrimination algorithm develop , make available widespread diagnostic application . Furthermore , whereas manometry recognize neuropathic , myopathic5,12 obstructive motor pattern , endoluminal image analysis may identify different category patient depend clinical presentation etiologic factor involve . This study design provide evidence algorithm , use image create PillCam SB2 capsule , least good small bowel manometry diagnose severe dysmotility .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Patients Patient 's age 1680 year , inclusive . One follow SB manometry procedure : Underwent SB manometry within five year result abnormal Underwent SB manometry within 1 year result normal Scheduled SB manometry within six month enrollment date Patient indicate small bowel manometry base one follow symptom : Pseudo obstruction small bowel : symptom resemble mechanical small bowel obstruction without evidence luminal compromise gut . Mechanical occlusion ruledout endoscopic / radiological study follow criterion attend physician . Patients may follow : recurrent acute episode ( least two ) air fluid level ( evidence least abdominal Xray ) , chronic symptom small bowel dilation resemble partial mechanical obstruction . Patients tested period ( nonacute ) remission . Chronic severe GI symptom inability maintain normal body weight : abdominal symptom ( nausea , abdominal distension , discomfort pain ) produce inability maintain normal body weight defined unintentional weight loss least 10 % original body weight onset symptom BMI &lt; 18.5 , normal diet ( without oral dietary supplement , enteral parenteral feeding ) . These chronic symptom last least 6 month . Patient legal guardian agree sign consent form Exclusion criterion Patients Acute exacerbation chronic obstructive symptom . Mechanical obstruction kind definite long stricture see radiological exam . Suspected GI stricture , follow AgileÂ® study could prove patency GI tract . Known history small bowel organic disease Crohn 's Disease Celiac . Patient suffers condition , swallow problem implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator precludes compliance study and/or device instruction . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug include aspirin , ( twice weekly ) 4 week precede CE exam . Patient undergone gastrectomy ( segmental small bowel resection 30 % ) . During period small bowel manometry Capsule endoscopy , patient undergone abdominal surgical procedure appendectomy , cholecystectomy , abdominal wall hernia repair catheter place enteral feeding . Manometry perform allow GI procedure . Patient pregnant . Known abuse alcohol illicit substance . Patient presently present acute life threaten condition . Participating another clinical study within 30 day . Inclusion criterion Healthy Volunteers Volunteer 's age 1680 year , inclusive .
