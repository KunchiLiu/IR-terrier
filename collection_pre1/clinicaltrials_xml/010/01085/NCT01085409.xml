	<brief_summary>Aim : The aim proposal investigate potential use value experience utility , measure Experience Sampling Method Day Reconstruction Method , economic evaluation health care . Methods : Three sample 46 patient different condition one sample 46 healthy control include study . The Experience Sampling Method ( ESM ) Day Reconstruction Method ( DRM ) adapt subsequently use measure experienced utility . Decision utility elicit traditional preference base method . Expected result : The expected result study threefold . First , unified version ESM DRM use economic evaluation health care develop apply . Second , rich dataset allow u investigate difference result experience utility derive method , traditional preference base measure . Third , normative implication use QALYs base either decision utility , experienced utility , combination two , health care resource allocation decision , examine . Keywords : experienced utility , decision utility , subjective well-being , experience sample method , day reconstruction method</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Q Quality Adjusted Life Years ( QALY ) : Exploring New Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study explore new methodology regard measurement health state utility . A new pharmaceutical nowadays reimburse evidence cost-effectiveness . This determined different type economic evaluation , cost-utility analysis ( CUA ) prefer guideline . In CUA health outcome technology measure quality adjust life year ( QALY ) . Utilities calculate QALYs base decision uncertainty ( decision utility ) . However , health care literature describe several problem lead bias measurement decision utility . These bias lead inaccurate estimation value health state therefore cause policy maker allocate resource inefficiently . To solve problem , suggest determine experience associate different health state measure well-being moment-to-moment ( experienced utility ) Experience Sampling Method Day Reconstruction Method . Differences utility measure use traditional preference base measure ( decision utility ) , use new state-of-art method ESM DRM ( experienced utility ) range population differ condition severity health state investigate . Since somatic , psychosomatic psychological condition likely differ way experience affect well-being , involve patient group category study well healthy control .</detailed_description>
