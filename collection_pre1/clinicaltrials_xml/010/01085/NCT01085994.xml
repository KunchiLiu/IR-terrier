	<brief_summary>Sepsis common associate significant mortality , morbidity health-care cost . Unfortunately , diagnosis straightforward sign symptoms neither specific sensitive ; addition , microbiological culture lack specificity , sensitivity plague high turn-around time . Because delay institution antimicrobial therapy may deleterious , broad-spectrum antibiotic widely use ICU-patients , even need . Procalcitonin may long sought bio-marker establish diagnosis sepsis may help decrease duration administer antibiotic course start .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procalcitonin Monitoring May Decrease Antibiotic Use Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , number study show utility procalcitonin ( PCT ) measurement reduce duration antibiotic treatment patient respiratory tract infection present primary care set emergency department . However , remain unclear similar strategy effectively safely implemented critical care set . We attempt address controversy issue , collect , analyze interpret currently available relevant evidence . To end , systematic review meta-analysis randomize controlled trial report outcome critically ill septic patient manage without procalcitonin-based algorithm perform .</detailed_description>

As routine practice , investigator consider institution discontinuation antibiotic attend physician aid clinical sign , symptom , microbiological data , well establish laboratory parameter ( i.e. , white blood cell count ) widely accept guideline without knowledge PCT value . The investigator set limitation regard time , country language publication . The investigator search trial conduct critically ill neonate child .
