	<detailed_description>Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) common disorder , define symptom-based diagnostic criterion . The pathogenesis multifactorial , gut motor dysfunction consider contributing factor . Dysmotility affect small bowel colon . Changes motor pattern small bowel IBS quantitative rather qualitative , distinct pattern distinguish patient healthy individual . Changes motor pattern potentially affect transit bowel content contribute symptom . Indeed , variation intestinal transit report patient IBS . Small bowel transit study , use scintigraphy , radio-opaque marker hydrogen breath test , show transit delay constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( C-IBS ) accelerate diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( D-IBS ) . Lubiprostone novel agent Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treatment adult male females chronic constipation . More recently , 2 randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial show drug effective relieving symptom patient C-IBS , result approval female patient C-IBS , dose 8 microgram twice day . The investigator hypothesize lubiprostone work laxative , actually alter motility pattern small intestine female C-IBS patient . These alteration could measure High Resolution Manometry ( HRM ) , new technique use catheter multiple , closely spaced sensor , special software use color scheme portray pressure gradient . This technique allow detailed assessment direction spread individual contraction . The investigator would like use HRM see lubiprostone affect intestinal contraction . The investigator would like achieve administer blinded participant lubiprostone placebo undergoing HRM seeing change contraction occur . Participants recruit investigator 's clinic word mouth . Patients investigator approach member research team regularly schedule clinic visit . If interested , potential subject provide copy consent form review . Patients give ample time review consent form friend , family , and/or physician . Patients informed opportunity review consent form , may contact study team schedule appointment one co-investigators discuss research address question concern patient may . Once potential subject 's issue concern address , individual would like enroll study , investigator co-investigator obtain informed consent . Referring physician ask give patient contact information study team recruitment process proceed describe . Participants undergo two visit : screen visit manometry visit . During screen visit determine eligibility , include application inclusion/exclusion criterion administration pregnancy test . Then manometry visit , patient receive two capsule ( lubiprostone placebo ) , three hour apart HRM . Patients receive capsule , know order 're receive . Patients may receive lubiprostone without participate research study . As lubiprostone FDA approve , indication would , however , patient receive drug standard care would undergo HRM receive placebo capsule . Patients also may require undergo washout standard medication start lubiprostone .</detailed_description>

Patients must take prohibited medication least 7 day prior manometry . Planned use drug agent 7 day prior Screening Visit affect gastrointestinal motility and/or perception include erythromycin Use investigational drug participation investigational study , within 30 day Screening Visit Known hypersensitivity drug .
