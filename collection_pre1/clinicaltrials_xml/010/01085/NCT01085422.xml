	<criteria>Subject histologically cytologically confirm prostate cancer . Metastatic prostate cancer measurable and/or bony disease progress despite androgen deprivation therapy least one two prior systemic non hormonal therapy ( least one must include docetaxel ) castration resistant metastatic disease . At least 28 day must elapse since completion prior anticancer therapy must recover side effect &lt; Grade 1 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . ECOG PS 3 allow due pain . Subjects must PSA progression define : A 25 % increase PSA baseline value increase absolute value PSA level 2 ng/ml , confirm another PSA level minimum 1 week interval . Subjects must minimum PSA &gt; 2 ng/ml . Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL . Subjects must continue primary androgen deprivation luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogue undergone orchiectomy . No investigational commercial agent ( LHRH analogue ) therapies include hormonal agent antiandrogens herbal medication may administer intent treat subject 's malignancy . Subjects stable dos steroid megestrol acetate ( hot flash appetite ) allow . Four week must elapse since major surgery . Prior radiotherapy allow long bone marrow function adequate least 4 week elapse since completion radiation therapy . No prior radiopharmaceutical allow . Subjects must normal organ bone marrow function define obtain within two week treatment initiation : Bone Marrow : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL ; platelet ≥ 100,000/mcL ; hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Renal function : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit institution 's normal ( ULIN ) range creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 Hepatic Function : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and/or alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULIN . For subject liver metastasis , AST and/or ALT &lt; 5 × ULIN . Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULIN ( Subjects Gilbert 's Syndrome may bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULIN ) Subjects refuse provide blood sample correlative study eligible . ABT888 temozolomide know teratogenic , therefore men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Subjects treat controlled epidural disease permit study . Subject capable understanding comply parameter outline protocol able sign date inform consent , approve Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) /Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , prior initiation screen study specific procedure . A subject cord compression history uncontrolled central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases leptomeningeal disease . Subject prior therapy Dacarbazine ( DTIC ) TMZ contain regimen . The subject receive investigational agent within 28 day prior study drug administration . Subject history seizure disorder currently receive medication seizure disorder ( e.g. , steroid anticonvulsant drug ) . The subject another active malignancy within past 1 year exception definitely treat carcinomas situ , superficial bladder cancer , nonmelanoma carcinoma skin . Questions regard inclusion individual subject discuss Abbott Medical Monitor . Clinically significant uncontrolled major medical condition ( ) include limited : active uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia , Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement , Or medical condition , opinion study investigator place subject unacceptably high risk toxicity . Subject previously treat PARP inhibitor .</criteria>
