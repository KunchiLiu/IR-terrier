	<brief_summary>We test computer game-style rehabilitation program people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . People PD often difficulty motor planning , initiate start movement . We believe program improve performance movement initiation task well activity daily live , walk , prepare meal open medicine bottle . We measure brain function use functional MRI training identify brain area involve improved performance . If effective , computer base train inexpensive treatment motor plan deficit PD free side effect easy administer large number patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our approach use PD-based adaptive training improve performance IG movement initiation patient PD . We three aim , 1 ) systematically evaluate cognitive rehabilitation people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , 2 ) examine neural mechanism subserve cognitive rehabilitation PD 3 ) ass ecological validity cognitive rehabilitation PD . We focus single aspect cognitive function , decision initiate movement . Movements internally generate ( IG ) externally cue , motor deficit PD typically link IG movement . The protocol design drive beneficial neuroplastic change use paradigm similar show promising result traumatic brain injury patient . In addition , use fMRI measure activity underlie basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit . Finally , goal research regard pathophysiology disease improve live patient disease , behavioral neuropsychological measure correlate fMRI measure functional abnormality train . Improvement initiation movement potential dramatically improve daily function include reduce fall , improve language production improve proficiency activity daily live .</detailed_description>
