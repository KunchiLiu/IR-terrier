The primary objective main trial determine extent participation life 's role optimize provision community-based structured program providing opportunity physical activity , leisure , social interaction .

Information emanate site well dissemination activity CSN Canadian Stroke Strategy , lead interest express site across Canada prepare run trial phase project . The study design propose two-period , site-stratified , randomize , crossover design time entry randomize immediate entry delay entry six month time difference group . The intervention period 9 month follow-up period additional 6 month ( total 15 mo . ) This design would provide assessment between- group within-person change . The main outcome amount time spend meaningful activity day ( outcome relate primary objective ) . Sample size require sufficient power detect between-group difference 240 subject sit across Canada . As considerable interest community reintegration , `` snowball '' entry site would make realistic accumulate sample size would also make result generalizable locally responsive .</detailed_description>
