	<brief_summary>To date except large striato-pallidal complex , reliable image marker small deep nucleus . Major improvement spatial resolution result use ultra-high field MRI system offer new perspective image deep structure . We use new contrast mechanism available data acquire ultra-high field MR system ( 7T ) well recent high angular diffusion image technique order characterize cytoarchitectonics deep brain structure brainstem lesion parkinsonian syndrome ( special interest substantia nigra ( SN ) pathology nigro-striatal fiber pathway ; subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) , red nucleus ( RN ) , oculomotor structure ( involve PSP ) ; pedonculo-pontine nucleus ( involved gait posture control disorder ) locus sub-coeruleus area ( implicated sleep disorder ) The optimized MR sequence 7T adapt validated 3T ( clinically orient MRI approach ) . The clinical goal project ( via characterization deep brain structure ) detection new neuroimaging marker neuronal lesion PD . These biomarkers use create diagnostic tool early stage disease could correlate clinical sign gait disorder help identify predictive factor . In addition , could contribute establish adequate therapeutic strategy ( example deep brain stimulation ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project divide several methodological step . First , establish image protocol use high field MR system ( 7T ) deliver high resolution data . The new T1/T2-star contrast mechanisms observed high field data make possible segmentation central structure , specifically deeply located brainstem , pons mesencephalon involved Parkinsonian syndrome . Second , characterize cytarchitectony deep structure anatomical connectivity involve Parkinsonian syndrome use high angular resolution diffusion imaging ( HARDI ) . The local information organization tissue come HARDI data use subdivide deep structure small nucleus . We also use HARDI data infer connectivity structure , employ probabilistic tractography algorithm efficient detect small bundle . Such technique never use Parkinsonian syndrome , may highlight structural difference inside deep nucleus could observe perform statistic entire structure . Third , preclinical study perform order tackle best spatial angular resolution build atlas brainstem help understand structural organization . Clinical acquisition do acquire two database healthy volunteer patient suffer Parkinsons disease progressive supranuclear palsy . Fourth , develop statistical tool isolate biomarkers Parkinsonian syndrome create diagnosis tool pathology , rely robust bootstrapping technique . The marker stem comparison population use various information available . Expected result In project , develop ultra high field technique allow u investigate characteristic brainstem structure central deep nucleus normal subject parkinsonian syndrome . The finding obtain image innovation technique help overcome present technical difficulty limit 1.5 3T MRI method transfer routine machine result compare image obtain 3T MRI , order make new diagnosis tool available , clinical research clinical practice . The ultimate goal improve accuracy diagnosis various parkinsonian syndrome early stage , detect pre-clinical stage abnormality may reflect underlie anatomical lesion , improve accuracy neurosurgical target deep brain stimulation , detect image marker may useful biomarkers progression disease neuroprotective therapy .</detailed_description>
