	<brief_title>Focused Ultrasound Surgery Treatment Pain Resulting From Metastatic Bone Tumors With ExAblate 2100 Conformal Bone System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone third common organ involve metastatic disease behind lung liver [ 6 ] . In breast cancer , bone second common site metastatic spread , 90 % patient die breast cancer bone metastasis . Breast prostate cancer metastasize bone frequently , reflect high incidence tumor , well prolonged clinical course . Post-cancer survival increase improvement early detection treatment . As consequence , number patient develop metastatic bone disease lifetime also increase . Current treatment patient bone metastasis primarily palliative include localized therapy ( radiation surgery ) , systemic therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiopharmaceutical , bisphosphonates although primary goal use therapy often address disease ) , analgesic ( opioids non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) . Recently , radiofrequency ablation test treatment option bone metastases [ 8 ] . Currently , label use Cryoablation technique test another alternative bone Mets palliation . The main goal treatment improvement quality life functional level . These goal describe : 1 . Pain relief 2 . Preservation restoration function 3 . Local tumor control 4 . Skeletal stabilization Treatment external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) standard care patient localize bone pain , result palliation pain many patient . Twenty 30 % patient treat radiation therapy experience pain relief [ 9-13 ] . Re-treatment rate generally report range 10-25 % . Many patient relapse pain poor response initial radiation may lose follow may refer back oncologists consideration re-radiation . In addition relapse re-treatment , increase risk pathologic fracture peri-radiation period . The fracture rate report radiation study generally range 1 % 8 % . The hyperemic response weaken adjacent bone increase risk spontaneous fracture . Furthermore , patient recurrent pain site previously irradiate may eligible radiation therapy secondary limitation normal tissue tolerance . Hesitation part physician use large dose may relate increase long-term toxicity . Larger radiation dose produce great risk complication fibrosis normal soft tissue , cause decrement quality life case life expectancy longer 6 month . There may also great incidence acute side effect nausea vomit treatment field include stomach . The percent patient experience vomit follow EBRT range 5 % 30 % . A palliative treatment painful bone metastases non-invasive , without long-term toxicity minimal complication would useful tool treat physician also beneficial option patient suffer painful bone metastasis . Results preliminary study indicate ExAblate treatment painful bone metastasis may beneficial treatment option [ 14 , 15 ] . The ExAblate system non-invasive thermal ablation device use coagulation various type soft tissue . The ExAblate system potential achieve first three four previously mention goal treatment bone tumor ; namely pain relief , preservation restoration functional level local tumor control [ 11 ] . The ExAblate system use present study technological advance ExAblate 2000 fix transducer system term flexibility use reduction positioning related pain patient . The ExAblate system use study conform patient 's body shape location bone mets location</detailed_description>
