	<brief_title>AZD6244 ( Selumetinib ) Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) hydrogen sulfate capsule patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity AZD6244 patient MM . II . To estimate progression-free survival duration response AZD6244 . III . To test whether AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate capsule downregulate tumor cell phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase ( pERK ) 1/2 . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 week .</detailed_description>
