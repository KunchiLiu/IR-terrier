	<brief_title>Identifying Treating Arousal Related Deficits Neglect Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neglect dysphagia two problematic behavioral disorder encounter stroke rehabilitation 300,000 patient affect annually US . Both disorder impede progress therapy lead costly medical complication , like fall associate neglect aspiration pneumonia malnutrition associate dysphagia . No widely accept pharmacological treatment exist either disorder . A new direction application view neglect dysphagia different disorder share common deficit magnitude estimation ( ME ) . ME refer one 's ability perceive intensity sensory stimulation . Deficits ME explain much stimulus neglect stroke patient . Sensory deficit also know produce dysphagia . Perceptual deficit influence patient response stimulus like fail act stimuli present ( neglect ) fail generate swallowing reflexes sufficient normal bolus flow ( dysphagia ) . We know previous work ME alter change cortical arousal follow stroke ( decrease hypoarousal ) . Hypoarousal evidence objective subjective post-stroke fatigue daytime sleepiness occur 50 % stroke patient persist chronically . Increasing arousal could potentially reverse perceptual deficit associate hypoarousal improve neglect dysphagia . This proposal manipulate arousal two way . Cold pressor stimulation ( CPS ) , immerse foot cold water 50 second , use increase arousal reverse neglect dysphagia temporarily . A brief , 3-day trial modafinil ( Provigil ) versus placebo use stroke patient learn positive response cold-pressor stimulation predict patient respond positively modafinil .</detailed_description>
