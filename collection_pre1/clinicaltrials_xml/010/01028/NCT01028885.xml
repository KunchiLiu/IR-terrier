	<brief_summary>This prospective clinical trial examine use MRI measure internal organ motion result change target volume ( shape location ) course post-operative radiation therapy prostate cancer . The goal well understand characterize physiologic variation account treatment planning process . The ultimate longer-term clinical goal provide form adaptive radiation therapy future , major change see 8-week course radiation therapy study . This may argue hypofractionating patient likely major shift time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate use MRI delineate clinical target volume , well endorectal balloon target immobilization patient treat radiation follow radical prostatectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : II . Trends time CTV , bladder rectum volume percent change baseline time point . III . Frequency event CTV fall outside PTV . IV . Proportion total CTV fall outside PTV event . V. Trends time dose-volume exposure bladder rectum . OUTLINE : Patients undergo MRI CT scan-based simulation treatment plan endorectal balloon target immobilization . The treatment target volume surround organ risk contour , treatment plan develop approve . Patients undergo 39 fraction image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy 8 week . Patients also undergo weekly MRI scan pelvis ( plan treatment position ) radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
