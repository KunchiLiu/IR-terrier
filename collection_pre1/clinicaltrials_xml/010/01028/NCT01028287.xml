	<detailed_description>Diabetes Mellitus significant grow health problem United States develop country . Despite improve public awareness , end-organ complication include diabetic nephropathy coronary atherosclerotic heart disease continue grow 5-10 % per year . While improvement control blood pressure wide-spread use antagonists renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system significantly improve renal outcome , therapy design disrupt central pathogenic mechanism diabetic nephropathy still need . Recent observation show effacement podocyte foot-plate process accelerate apoptosis , central pathogenesis diabetic nephropathy . The resulting increase glomerular permeability lead nephrotic range proteinuria interstitial fibrosis local synthesis transform growth factor b ( TGF-b ) direct toxicity renal epithelium . Recent study show synthetic form adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) able achieve sustain reduction proteinuria non-diabetic glomerulopathies . Moreover , number patient quite limited , preliminary study also suggest pharmacologic administration ACTH reduce proteinuria patient diabetic nephropathy . The observation ACTH reduce proteinuria variety glomerulopathies suggest ACTH may important podocyte function viability independent primary disease . Interestingly , recent study confirm melanocortin receptor express non-adrenal tissue include circulate T B cell recently glomerular podocyte . Previous study investigate effect diabetes insulin therapy ACTH level give mixed result . It therefore unclear podocytes patient diabetic nephropathy could become functionally deficient ACTH . However , study adrenal cortical cell find TGF-b able regulate expression ACTH receptor . Moreover , TGF-b able block ACTH-induced stimulation melanocortin receptor . This intriguing link TGF-b ACTH signal raise question whether impaired signal ACTH glomerulus lead podocyte dysfunction , accelerate detachment ultimately podocyte apoptosis . Moreover , postulate complex interaction TGF-b ACTH expression exists within glomerulus restoration ACTH function lead reduction renal TGF-b expression . We therefore propose study effect increase dos exogenous ACTH rate albuminuria urinary TGF-b expression diabetic nephrotic range proteinuria . In addition TGF-b examine whether similar effect occur 3 major isoforms vascular endothelial growth factor , VEGF120 , 164 , 180 . We also determine duration effect whether additive ACE/ARB therapy inhibition .</detailed_description>
