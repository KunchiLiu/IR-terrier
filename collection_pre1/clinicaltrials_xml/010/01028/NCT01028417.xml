	<brief_summary>LAY ABSTRACT 1 . Statement health problem issue : Of estimate 24,000 Canadians diagnose lung cancer 2008 , 21,000 die disease . Based cancer incidence survival data , promise current strategy improve outcome screen early detection . It suggest lesion discover early stage disease , high likelihood treatable therefore , survival improve . CT detection grow small lung nodule , many non-cancerous ( benign ) , raise possibility lung cancer thus cause anxiety patient refer clinician . Unfortunately , confident separation benign malignant small lung nodule reliably achieve use CT PET criterion . Pathologic diagnosis use needle excision biopsy usually require . Excision biopsy remove entire nodule one setting eliminate sample error associate needle biopsy , make appeal physician patient . To reduce post-operative pain breathing difficulty , excision biopsy often perform use minimally invasive surgery ( video assist thoracoscopic surgery , VATS ) . Finding small pulmonary nodule often difficult minimally invasive camera ( VATS ) big incision ( thoracotomy ) necessary 60 % patient . We recently develop technique use platinum micro-coils , insert lung nodule use CT guidance , locate nodule fluoroscopy excise VATS . We complete pilot study ( n=75 nodule ; 69 patient ) determine effectiveness technique . Seventy three ( 97 % ) 4-24-mm nodule successfully remove fluoroscopically guided VATS excision . 2 . Objective project : To improve ability successfully excise small grow lung nodule minimally invasive VATS surgery use CT guide micro-coil localization technique . 3 . How undertake work ? We propose conduct randomize controlled trial determine use CT guide platinum microcoil marker VATS excision subcentimetre pulmonary nodule reduce rate conversion open thoracotomy 50 % 10 % . 4 . What unique/innovative project ? New image guide minimally invasive surgical technique remove early grow cancer develop Vancouver General Hospital University British Columbia . This publish peer-reviewed journal potentially allow u accurately locate excise suspicious lung nodule 5 . Relevance Lung Association 's mission statement ? Lung cancer remain major health problem Canada . Early detection screen program allow discovery nodule still small therefore , likely curable . Excision biopsy remove entire nodule one setting eliminate sample error associate needle biopsy , make appeal patient physician . To reduce post operative morbidity , cost volume lung remove , excision biopsy often perform use video assist thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) technique . Using pilot project grant BC Lung Association develop new technique allow preoperative CT marking nodule minimally invasive removal lesion . We hope technique allow earlier treatment lung cancer improve survival devastate disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study See Microcoil Insertion Reduces Rate Open Thoracotomy Removal Lung Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention Description : The pre-operative CT scan review surgeon radiologist determine nodule excise use thoracoscopic staple wedge technique . After informed consent , patient see anesthesiologist determine risk benefit general anesthetic . The patient initially come CT scanner suite radiology department . The CT guide percutaneous microcoil nodule localization procedure , perform consciously local anaesthesia Using sterile technique local anesthetic , biopsy needle ( 22 gauge ) pre-loaded 6 cm long platinum microcoil place 10mm deep suspicious pulmonary nodule use CT guidance . The coil deploy one end adjacent nodule end lie free : lung surface . The patient transfer Laurel OR place general anesthesia double lumen endotracheal tube order allow collapse involve lung thoracoscopic excision mark lung nodule . The patient 's blood pressure , oxygen level , pulse ECG monitor . The thoracoscopic excision nodule perform use microcoil localize device . Using preoperative CT scan , study surgeon mark insertion site thoracoscopic instrument . Instruments video-assisted thoracoscopy include rigid 5 mm thoracoscope , light source , video-camera monitor , 5 mm grasp forceps . The patient drape . A 5mm thoracoscopic port insert thorax percutaneously lung examine thoracoscope . The nodule location identify end microcoil sits surface lung . A second 5 mm port put place end microcoil grasp thoracoscopic visualization . Multiple endoscopic place via third 12mm port nodule coil completely excise fluoroscopic guidance . The resected nodule place endoscopic bag bring large port site . If lesion excise VATS technique patient undergo open rib spread thoracotomy excision mark nodule . The indication thoracotomy time : poor visualization lung , pleural symphysis scarring , uncontrollable bleed inability completely resect lesion thoracoscopic endostapler . The specimen send frozen section pathological examination . If lesion benign thoracic cavity irrigate saline small chest tube put place attached water drainage . The incision close lung re-expanded . The patient transport post-anesthetic room similar patient undergo general anesthesia . If lesion non-small cell cancer lung patient may undergo sample lymph node time follow formal lobectomy . If patient inadequate pulmonary function tolerate lobectomy lesion completely excise surgeon may choose stop operation time follow patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients evaluate eligibility use follow criterion : All newly diagnose patient small lung nodule &lt; 1cm require excision history prior ipsilateral thoracotomy . The nodule must locate part lung amenable thoracoscopic wedge excision nodules.The external surface lesion must least 2 cm major pulmonary artery , vein , main bronchus allow safe adequate thoracoscopic excision lesion . Patients must mentally competent give write , informed consent Patients must capable independently complete standard Englishlanguage QOL instrument . Patients exclude trial consent participate study , radiologist surgeon agree nodule locate centrally safely excise use thoracoscopic wedge technique . Patients three nodule exclude study . Patients positive diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer obtain sputum cytology , bronchoscopy , CT guide needle biopsy exclude study . If patient exclude , he/she receive current standard treatment , may include needle biopsy , continue observation nodule three six monthly interval , excisional surgery ( thoracoscopy open thoracotomy ) .</criteria>
