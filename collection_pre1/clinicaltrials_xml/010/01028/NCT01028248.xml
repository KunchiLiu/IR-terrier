	<brief_title>Lucentis Macular Edema Associated With Central Retinal Vein Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinal Venous Occlusive disease second diabetic retinopathy major cause blindness associate retinal vascular disease . Macular edema major cause vision loss patient present central hemi vein occlusion . Until recently standard care macular edema secondary central retinal vein occlusion observation . Recent investigation steroid condition show great visual benefit associate risk cataract formation increase intraocular pressure . In past laser photocoagulation use , find offer visual benefit natural history treatment macular edema associate CRVO . Ranibizumab ( rhuFab V2 ) , anti-VEGF agent , potent inhibitor vascular permeability , potential reduce retinal vascular leakage diminish macular edema . In addition , anti-VEGF agent , may also inhibit neovascularization iris , frequent complication ischemic central retinal vein occlusion . Ranibizumab use intravitreal agent carry risk intraocular infection probably carry low risk glaucoma cataract formation , make potentially safer pharmacologic treatment CRVO associate macular edema compare steroid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study Age &gt; 18 year Clinical evidence perfuse central retinal vein occlusion . A central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) define eye retinal hemorrhage dilate retinal venous system 4 quadrant . Other evidence CRVO may include telangiectatic capillary bed collateral vessel optic nerve head . Central macular edema present clinical examination OCT test central point thickness and/or central 1mm subfield thickness &gt; 250 micron . Visual acuity score great equal 19 letter ( 20/400 ) less equal 73 letter ( 20/40 ) ETDRS visual acuity protocol . Media clarity , pupillary dilation patient cooperation sufficient allow OCT test retinal photography Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) know pregnant ; also premenopausal woman use adequate contraception . Participation another ocular investigation trial simultaneously Uncontrolled hypertension Any condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g . chronic alcoholism , drug abuse ) Significant diabetic retinopathy ( great moderate NPDR ) macular edema associate diabetic retinopathy Evidence vitreoretinal interface abnormality ocular exam OCT may contribute macular edema An eye , investigator 's opinion , chance improve visual acuity follow resolution macular edema ( e.g . presence subretinal fibrosis geographic atrophy ) Presence another ocular condition may affect visual acuity macular edema course study ( e.g . AMD , uveitis , IrvineGas ) Evidence neovascularization iris retina ( presence ischemic CRVO ) Evidence central atrophy fibrosis study eye Presence substantial cataract , one might decrease vision 3 line vision sometime study . History grid/focal laser panretinal laser study eye History vitreous surgery study eye History use intravitreal , peribulbar , retrobulbar steroid within six month study . History cataract surgery within 6 month enrollment . History YAG capsulotomy within 2 month surgery . Visual acuity &lt; 20/400 fellow eye Uncontrolled glaucoma ( pressure &gt; 30 ) despite treatment glaucoma medication . History cerebral vascular accident myocardial infarction within 3 month prior Day 0 .</criteria>
