	<brief_title>Study Assess Effect 8 Wks Duloxetine Therapy Breast Cancer Patients With Aromatase-Inhibitor Associated Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy commonly use treatment postmenopausal woman hormone receptor-positive breast cancer . The common toxicity arthralgias myalgia , difficult manage necessitate discontinuation therapy 10 % patient . One potential interventional approach pharmaceutical agent duloxetine , show effective treatment type chronic pain , include fibromyalgia diabetic neuropathic pain . The primary objective pilot study determine proportion breast cancer patient AI-associated musculoskeletal symptom experience 30 % reduction average pain score baseline 8 week due duloxetine treatment . Participants treat duloxetine 8 week . Questionnaires evaluate pain , functional status , depression , menopausal symptom , sleep difficulty administer baseline 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week therapy . In addition , 10 milliliter blood drawn subject baseline future pharmacogenetic evaluation . If result pilot study suggest efficacy duloxetine therapy great expect placebo base historical control , data use design future prospective , placebo-controlled , randomized trial treatment duloxetine patient population .</detailed_description>
