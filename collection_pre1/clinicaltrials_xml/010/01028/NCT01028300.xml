	<brief_summary>Degenerative disc disease ( DDD ) refer syndrome degenerate disc cause chronic back pain , significantly impact individual 's ability function . The condition commonly diagnose lumbosacral spinal segment L3-S1 . The condition often start injury disc space . The injury weaken disc creates excessive motion correspond vertebral level . Over time , segmental instability associate neurological compromise combine ongoing inflammatory process occur around disc produce low back pain . The reparative process disc poor , thus painful symptom become chronic . Premature degeneration adjacent level spine remain one vexing problem face spinal surgeon advise relatively young people consider lumbar fusion surgery . Stopping motion change mechanic back ( design motion flexibility ) result transfer loads stress adjacent vertebral segment . It therefore intuitive pursue total disc replacement , allow treatment pain due DDD re-establishing motion stability , load distribution , restore disc height , alternative spinal fusion surgery . The study hypothesis military personnel receive Total Disc Replacement return level active duty performance time recent successful physical readiness test .</brief_summary>
