The placebo solution solution ingredient Syntocinon Spray except oxytocin 2 oz vial contain 30 ml solution design deliver 0.1 ml meter volume per insufflation prepare Triangle Compounding Pharmacy . Treatment assignment random within gender . Vials contain oxytocin placebo spray relabeled Dorothea Dix Hospital Pharmacy UNC Investigational Drug Service subject raters blind treatment . Social cognition competence test begin 50 min morning treatment day 14 , 28 42 treatment trial follow rating psychotic , mood anxiety symptom ( require 1-3 hr depend much social cognition test do ) . The FEIT , Reading Mind Eyes test ( Eyes Test ) Trustworthiness Tasks ( see ) well psychiatric rating conduct time point Brüne , AIHQ , social competence task ( see ) conduct treatment day 14 42 . On treatment day , subject take 20-30 min break FEIT , Eyes Test , Trustworthiness Brüne task ensue AIHQ social competence task follow psychiatric rating . At end treatment protocol ( treatment day 42 ) , subject research staff conduct social cognition test make psychiatric rating ask guess treatment subject receive . Subjects may take part study outpatient inpatient may start inpatient complete protocol outpatient set . Subjects train research nurse first dose test substance intranasal self-administration shortly baseline measurement complete . During preliminary study Dorothea Dix CRU , 10 subject enrol quickly easily master procedure . After learn intranasal self-administration , subject wish participate study outpatient give write instruction time day 's test treatment procedure follow home . They give one 2 ounce vial contain 30 ml test substance supply last first outpatient clinic test appointment instruct begin twice daily intranasal treatment . Subjects wish study hospital already inpatients CRU admit shortly complete baseline measurement . Outpatient subject visit outpatient study site ( CTRC CRU ) morning treatment day 14 , 28 42 ( provide snack breakfast lunch depend length visit ) . They self administer test substance site staff confirm use proper technique . In addition social cognition/competence test psychiatric rating , blood sample well vital sign obtain visit . At 40 min last intranasal insufflation , blood ( 15 ml ) drawn measure plasma oxytocin concentration lab value ( Na , K , glucose [ treatment day 14 , 28 42 ] , CBC , BUN , creatinine , GGT [ treatment day 14 , 42 ] ) . An ECG also obtain morning treatment day 14 42 approximately 3-4 hr intranasal treatment ( social cognition/competence test psychiatric rating complete ) . Urine also collect female subject day baseline measurement treatment day 28 42 pregnancy test . These procedure conduct morning treatment day 14 , 28 , 42 subject study inpatient . After procedure study site morning treatment day 14 28 , outpatient subject give new vial contain 30 ml test substance self administer dos twice daily next visit study site . Subjects instruct store vial room temperature clean tip spray nozzle alcohol wipe dose administer . Vials weight dispense upon return clinic 2 wks later determine much solution actually eject vial . Measurements : A battery well-validated instrument quantify psychiatric symptom , social cognition social competence use study . The domain measure instrument use summarize . Psychiatric symptom rat research staff among good inter-rater reliability establish . Psychiatric Measures Psychotic symptom : The Positive Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS , White et al. , 1997 ) 30-item scale interviewer rate subject severity positive negative psychotic symptom mood behavioral symptom ask standard series question . Items rat scale 1 ( absent ) 7 ( severe ) , yield five scaled score : positive symptom ( include several subscales include paranoia ) , negative symptom , dysphoric mood , activation , autistic preoccupation .
