	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose combination BIBW 2992 cetuximab patient non-small cell lung cancer acquire resistance erlotinib gefitinib . Overall safety , pharmacokinetics anti-tumor activity combination BIBW 2992 cetuximab patient non-small cell lung cancer acquire resistance erlotinib , gefitinib BIBW 2992 evaluate secondary objective . Initially standard , 3+3 dose escalation perform determine MTD BIBW 2992 administer together cetuximab patient advance non small cell lung cancer acquire resistance erlotinib gefitinib . Subsequently , preliminary efficacy safety identify MTD cetuximab administer BIBW 2992 explore combo arm via expansion MTD cohort total 140 EGFR mutation positive NSCLC acquire resistance erlotinib/gefitinib . Furthermore , safety preliminary anti-tumor activity combination therapy EGFR mutant NSCLC patient develop acquire resistance ( AR ) BIBW 2992 , assess sequential arm . The sequential arm use two-stage design early stopping rule 12 patient acquire resistance BIBW 2992 receive 5 course BIBW 2992 plus cetuximab . If response see 12 patient 5 course combination therapy , accrual sequential arm stop . If 1 response observe , sequential arm expand 40 patient .</brief_summary>
