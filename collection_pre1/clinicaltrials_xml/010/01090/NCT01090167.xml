	<brief_summary>This study sponsor Genzyme Japan K.K . The purpose study assess safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics Clofarabine ( JC0707 ) intravenously administer Japanese adult patient newly diagnose relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) 20 , 30 , 40 mg/m2/day 5-day dose schedule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Clofarabine Japanese Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , multi-center study Clofarabine administer Japanese patient Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) relapsed/refractory elderly untreated AML standard induction chemotherapy unlikely benefit . Cohort 1 receive 20 mg/m2/day Clofarabine daily five consecutive day , Cohort 2 receive 30 mg/m2/day , Cohort 3 receive 40 mg/m2/day . Patients receive one cycle rule . However , evidence hematologic response one cycle treatment Clofarabine , patient may receive maximum three cycle . If patient fail achieve CR CRp two cycle treatment Clofarabine , dose patient stop . Three patient constitute cohort receive Clofarabine assess dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) Cycle 1 . If none three patient develop DLT , next cohort introduce . If one develop DLT , three new patient added cohort , six patient total included tolerability assessment . In case , treatment next cohort allow case number patient develop DLT still one six-patient cohort . If two six patient develop DLT , however , tolerability rule . However , two DLTs observe 20mg/m2/day dose cohort , new patient enrol cohort -1 15mg/m2/day ; one six patient cohort develop DLT , consider last cohort study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosis relapse refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion untreated AML patient ( 60 year 74 year ) standard induction chemotherapy unlikely benefit judge investigator ( coinvestigator ) Age time inform consent 20 year 74 year ; 60 year old patient previously untreated AML Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 Be able comply study procedure followup examination specify protocol . Hepatic , renal , pancreatic , cardiac function satisfy laboratory value criteria Patients diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL , FrenchAmericanBritish classification M3 WHO classification APL ( 15 ; 17 ) ( q22 ; q12 ) , ( PML/RARA variant ) Have prior hematologic stem cell transplant Have prior external beam radiation therapy pelvis Have systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , infection control exhibit symptom relate infection despite appropriate treatment . In addition , patient must temperature less 38.0 least 48 hour prior first dose study drug . Have severe concurrent disease difficult control drug therapy , history serious organ dysfunction disease involve liver , kidney , pancreas , heart , organ system may place patient undue risk Diagnosis another malignancy , unless patient meet none follow condition : 1 ) Any persist treatmentrelated adverse event ; 2 ) Less 180 day diseasefree duration count period treatment completion enrollment ; note patient meet following condition eligible : Patients treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia eligible study treatment condition complete . Patients organconfined prostate cancer evidence recurrent progressive disease base prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) value also eligible study hormonal therapy initiate radical prostatectomy perform . Have prior positive test HBs antigen antibody , HBc antibody , HCV antibody , HIV antigen antibody ; note patient treatment vaccine positive HBs antibody eligible . Have clinically significant arrhythmia screen know family history QT prolongation . Marked prolongation QTc interval exceed 450 msec consider clinically significant Have clinical evidence suggestive central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement leukemia Have Psychiatric disorder would interfere consent , study participation , followup Have prior treatment study drug Have chemotherapy investigational agent receive within 30 day prior first dose study drug If receive chemotherapy investigational agent prior time point , drugrelated adverse event must recover baseline value Grade 1 less prior first dose study drug ( except alopecia , nail change ) . Is currently participate another concurrent investigational protocol Are pregnant lactate . Male female patient fertile must agree use effective mean birth control avoid pregnancy study period six month last dose study drug .</criteria>
