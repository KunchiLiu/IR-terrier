	<brief_summary>MiroCam® new video capsule endoscope IntroMedic® . By use novel transmission technology promise long battery life expectancy consequential impact length video record diagnostic evaluation . As investigator know shortcoming battery life expectancy many capsule examination inconclusive ileocaecal transit film , investigator would appreciate capsule extend video record improve diagnostic yield capsule examination . Therefore investigator want compare MiroCam® routinely use Olympus® Enteropro EndoCapsule® context half-year clinical trial . Focussing total video length well rate video-recorded ileocaecal transition surrogate parameter investigator want find whether one two product provide superior diagnostic information order reduce amount inconclusive examination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Video Capsule Endoscopy ( VCE ) Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Video capsule endoscopy ( VCE ) important tool diagnostic management several gastrointestinal ( GI ) disorder . Taking video pass GI tract , VCE technique provide image information whole small bowel . It comfortable safe procedure ; complication due capsule retention rare [ 1 ] . The main disadvantage VCE make dependence macroscopic information . Therefore reliably use detection disorder need histological confirmation . However , lot macroscopic pathology diagnose excluded VCE . Above , obscure digestive bleeding ( ODB ) become main indication use VCE [ 2 ] . Independent type bowel preparation use , ileocaecal transit visualize 20 percent VCE examination , mean loss diagnostic information last intestinal part [ 3 ] . Risk factor incomplete VCE include previous small-bowel surgery , hospitalization , moderate poor bowel cleanse gastric transit time longer 45 minute [ 4 ] . Especially latter case , success examination determine battery life expectancy capsule technology use [ 5 ] . The new MiroCam® , brand IntroMedic® , advertise long battery life expectancy competitive product throughout market . To prove pronouncement , pilot-study 16 patient present He Man Kim UEGW 2008 , compare MiroCam® Given® 's PillCam® sequential application capsule . Although battery life expectancy MiroCam® significantly high , significant difference diagnostic yield product [ 6 ] . Currently similar comparison study MiroCam® Pill Cam® ongoing France , involve high amount patient [ unpublished data ] . Study Aims In prospective study want compare IntroMedic® 's MiroCam® Olympus® Enteropro EndoCapsule® far routinely used department . We want investigate whether one two product provide superior diagnostic information small bowel . The primary endpoint total video length register well rate successful ileocoecal transition ongoing video registration . The secondary end point number pathology detect capsule . If significant difference two tested product , preferred usage superior product may improve diagnostic yield future examination avoid incomplete video registration small bowel . Study Design Prospective Study without randomisation blinding Study Population Patients transfer unit undergo video capsule endoscopy - Obscure digestive bleeding ( ODB ) - Chronic anaemia unknown origin - Chronic diarrhoea Exclusion criterion : - Patients age 18 year - Patients present contraindication video capsule endoscopy already know gastrointestinal stenosis , already know gastrointestinal adhesion , already know diverticulum small bowel , already know severe diabetes induce intestinal hypomotility - Refusal participate study Methods Our investigation perform Medical University Vienna , department medicine III , clinical division gastroenterology hepatology . Patient recruitment start 1st January 2010 . The study last six month . The number patient include within period around 50 , base current amount VCE examination perform department . All patient fulfil list inclusion criterion , receive patient information form study together routine inform consent form VCE . Potentially occur question course examination , data acquisition process context study answer medical professional . As routine preparation VCE , patient receive 2 litre washout solution previous day examination . At day procedure fasting require . The patient swallow first capsule successful mount adhesive electrode register tool capsule product . The second capsule swallow two hour later - knowledge first capsule already pass gastro-duodenal transit time . The two capsule use investigation already mention MiroCam® ( product IntroMedic® , Seoul , Korea ) Enteropro EndoCapsule® ( product Olympus® , Tokyo , Japan ) . To reduce bias make sequence capsule use , randomize capsule position examination , follow computer generate list . After capsule swallow , fast continue four hour prevent image interference VCE . Risk/Benefit Assessment The safety product use within investigation already prove former clinical trial [ 7 , 8 ] . For patient enrol study potentially high risk complication make expected increase diagnostic yield implicate evaluation two different bowel video . The notable discomfort patient participate investigation cause rather high amount adhesive electrode necessary capsule . There interference two video signal already show former investigation [ 6,9 ] .</detailed_description>
