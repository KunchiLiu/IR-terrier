	<brief_summary>Preterm birth ( birth 37 week gestation ) large problem United States major cause neonatal morbidity mortality childhood neurological disability . Despite significant advance care pregnant mother , incidence preterm labor rise . There grow recognition cytokine inflammatory mediator present amniotic fluid placenta play fundamental role regulate labor . Cytokines chemical fluid tell body 's immune system . These ( biomarkers ) measure small amount ( drop ) amniotic fluid . The researcher previously show people risk preterm labor high cytokine level . However , understand in-utero environment currently require invasive sampling , amniocentesis , determine cytokine concentration . This procedure inherent risk , cause patient discomfort anxiety , thus avail routine use repeat sampling , especially non-high risk patient . Therefore , researcher look non-invasive sample predict in-utero environment . To date , study simultaneously evaluate different maternal-fetal compartment determine relationship marker among compartment . Therefore , purpose pilot study determine differential expression inflammatory mediator various maternal-fetal compartment ; specifically , vaginal fluid , cervical secretion , placenta , cord blood ( arterial venous ) , amniotic fluid , maternal serum , maternal urine , maternal saliva . The researcher seek obtain fluid sample nine maternal-fetal compartment determine inflammatory mediator expression . The timing collection , location , propose study sample outline Table 1 . In pilot study , plan enroll 20 patient undergoing cesarean delivery . After consent , sample collect give unique Study ID number . No protect health information collect . In addition , link Study ID patient identifier . Therefore , seek HIPAA authorization time consent . While none sample would routinely collect part standard care , collection procedure meet criterion minimal risk .</brief_summary>
