	<brief_title>Transnasal Insufflation ( TNI ) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) slowly proceed lung disease basic pathophysiologic mechanism partly understand far difficult access pharmacological sundry approach besides smoke cessation . Average life expectancy clearly limit especially advanced stage respiratory insufficiency . Based different small survey long-term oxygen treatment classify routine COPD treatment patient develop hypoxemia . The primary application non-invasive ventilation Routine treatment COPD patient acute respiratory decompensation develop hypoxemia respiratory acidosis , reduces acute mortality various prospective randomize study show . On side distinct information data initiation nocturnal positive pressure breathe therapy chronic hypercapnia appear progression COPD . Nocturnal positive pressure therapy applique mask assume routine treatment neuromuscular restrictive thorax disease , nocturnal ventilation result distinct increase life expectancy . In contrast data positive pressure therapy COPD inconsistent initiation nocturnal breathing therapy practise many place , scientifically confirm yet . It know various study patient collective nocturnal positive pressure therapy , like patient obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome , 50 70 % patient use therapy constantly . Daily practice show patient chronic hypercapnia base COPD even hard accustom oneself nocturnal breathe therapy patient restrictive lung diseases patient obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome . Reasons know , maybe significant lung distension increase appearance depressive anxiety disorder COPD patient responsible . Perhaps patient feel subjective improvement medical condition n't accept tight closing mask night . As result alternate form breathing support would desirable .</detailed_description>
