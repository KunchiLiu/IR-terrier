	<detailed_description>Introduction : Percutaneous treatment bifurcation lesion complex procedure . After main vessel stent implantation , side branch become jailed carina displace result complete occlusion vessel . Re-wiring side branch condition may result difficult time impossible . There agreement regard need side branch pre-dilation ( main vessel stent implantation ) reduce complication . Researchers European Bifurcation Club propose pre-dilate side branch avoid vessel dissection difficulty rewire true lumen vessel . On contrary , group good experience treatment bifurcation lesion treat side branch pre-dilation . Aims : 1.- To determine efficacy side-branch pre-dilation patient bifurcation lesion treat provisional T stenting . 2.- To determine success rate incidence complication patient without side-branch pre-dilation , well economic impact term number use wire . Design : Prospective randomize study . Patients method : The series constitute 420 patient bifurcation lesion treat drug-eluting stent ; 210 patient treated side branch pre-dilation main vessel stent implantation , remain 210 patient randomized pre-dilation side-branch . Primary end point : - TIMI flow Side Branch main vessel stent implantation . Secondary end point : - Time re-wiring . - Number use wire . - % stenosis Side Branch . - Levels CK TpI procedure . - Related cardiac event 9 month . Relevance : Currently controversy use side branch pre-dilation patient bifurcation lesion treat provisional T-stenting . However , comparative study literature .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients atherosclerotic coronary disease bifurcation lesion significant stenosis side branch . Main vessel diameter great 2.5 mm diameter operator 's visual estimate . The side branch exceed 2.25 mm diameter operator 's visual estimate . Patients damage main branch length side branch lesion small 5 mm length . Patients bifurcation lesion fulfil follow morphology classification Medina : 1 1 1 , 1 0 1 , 0 1 1 . Treatment bifurcation lesion previsional drug elute stent . Symptoms stable angina acute coronary syndrome . Contraindication drug elute stent implantation . Cardiogenic shock . Coexistence serious systemic disease . Patients impossible guide placement side branch stent implantation main vessel . Patients bifurcation lesion side branch le 2 mm .</criteria>
