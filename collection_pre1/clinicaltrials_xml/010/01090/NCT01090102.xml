	<brief_summary>The objective study determine whether 12 week mesalamine therapy add standard HIV treatment decrease systemic immune activation inflammation HIV-infected patient , possibly result well recovery immune system . The study hypothesis decrease inflammation directly gut may decrease potential cause chronic inflammation , potentially result immunologic benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesalamine Reduce T Cell Activation HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While HIV-infected patient achieve nearly complete viral suppression currently available HIV medication , still least 10-year short life expectancy general population high risk disease associate accelerate age include cardiovascular disease non-AIDS-defining cancer . Persistent inflammation immune activation believe drive increase risk . Despite suppression viral replication peripheral blood effective HIV medication , HIV may continue express low level T cell line gut may also result translocation bacterial product across line gut , drive persistent inflammation . We believe decrease inflammation directly gut may decrease potential cause chronic inflammation , potentially result immunologic benefit . Mesalamine oral anti-inflammatory drug use treat patient inflammatory bowel disease , act locally gut tissue decrease inflammation , associate side effect . If mesalamine therapy reduces immune activation inflammation study , would prompt large study see mesalamine decrease clinical outcome like cardiovascular disease , cancer , mortality setting .</detailed_description>
