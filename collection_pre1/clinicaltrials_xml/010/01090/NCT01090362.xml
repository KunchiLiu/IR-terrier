	<detailed_description>Using data 1000 randomly select centre across 35 country , represent possible care setting , registry help characterize real-life anticoagulant treatment pattern outcomes , include rate stroke bleed complication , well provide data important issue , physician ' compliance guideline patient ' adherence therapy . This particularly timely standard practice move away vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) -dominated therapy towards new era novel oral anticoagulant ( OACs ) , i.e . direct Factor Xa inhibitor direct thrombin inhibitor . To ensure dataset truly reflect current practice , investigator request prospectively enrol newly diagnose patient non-valvular AF least one additional investigator-determined risk factor stroke . Patients consecutively recruit one five cohort follow least 2 year . With 3 cohort complete 36,000 enrol GARFIELD-AF continue recruit patient , conjunction registry non-interventional study , source informative useful data come year . The finding serve increase understanding management patient AF improve practice benefit .</detailed_description>
