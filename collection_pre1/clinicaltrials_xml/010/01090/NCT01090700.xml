	<detailed_description>TMC435 investigate treatment chronic HCV infection , combination Peg-IFN ( pegylated interferon ) RBV ( ribavirin ) . Peg-IFN plus RBV currently accept method treat HCV . Treatment Peg-IFN plus RBV HCV infection associate high rate depression . The result study provide dose recommendation coadministration TMC435 escitalopram HCV-infected patient . This Phase I , open-label ( participant investigator know name medication ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , crossover trial 18 healthy participant investigate pharmacokinetic interaction escitalopram TMC435 , steady state . Steady state term mean drug give long enough plasma concentration remain subsequent dose . The participant receive three treatment ( treatment A-B-C ) randomize order . In Treatment A , participant receive TMC435 150 mg q.d . In Treatment B , participant receive escitalopram 10 mg q.d . In treatment C , participant receive escitalopram 10 mg q.d . TMC435 150 mg q.d . All treatment administer 7 day food . There washout period ( period treatment take view medication eliminate body start new treatment ) least 10 day last intake study medication one session first intake study medication subsequent session . Pharmacokinetic profile two compound measure blood sample take regular interval study safety tolerability assess study period follow-up . Safety tolerability evaluation record regular interval throughout trial period . Blood urine sample , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) take screening , medication intake day 1 7 Day 8 session 2 follow visit 1 week 4-5 week last dose drug last session . A physical examination perform screening , day -1 ( = day day first medication intake session ) 2 follow visit . On morning first medication intake ( first session ) blood sample take examine CYP2C19 gene , responsible production enzyme determine breakdown drug body . The result study provide dose recommendation coadministration TMC435 escitalopram HCV-infected patient . Participants receive treatment A TMC435 150 mg q.d. , treatment B participant receive escitalopram 10 mg treatment C participant receive escitalopram 10 mg q.d . + TMC435 150 mg q.d . All treatment administer 7 day food .</detailed_description>
