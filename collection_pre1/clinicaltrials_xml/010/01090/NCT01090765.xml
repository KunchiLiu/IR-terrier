	<brief_summary>Background : - Currently , curative therapy metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , lead cause death men . However , researcher explore new treatment involve drug prevent angiogenesis ( process new blood vessel form ) slow prevent tumor growth . - TRC105 experimental drug block angiogenesis , study possible use treat different kind cancer . However , validate treat prostate cancer general CRPC particular . Objectives : - To determine effect TRC105 treatment CRPC - To determine safety effectiveness TRC105 treat CRPC Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age diagnose castrate-resistant prostate cancer exist treatment effective . Design : - Eligible individual series blood test determine suitability participate study . - Participants receive intravenous infusion TRC105 28-day treatment cycle . Participants receive i.v . ( intravenous ) infusion TRC105 every two week day 1 15 28-day cycle ( cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 ) every week day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28 day cycle ( cohort 4 ) . - Participants receive different dos TRC105 depend enter study , maximum tolerate dose optimum treatment dose . - Frequent blood urine test perform treatment , well test cancer progression direct study doctor . Participants receive medicine help prevent possible adverse side effect TRC105 , allergic reaction drug . - Participants continue treatment TRC105 study team decide medication beneficial . No additional testing require unless participant discontinue treatment side effect ( study doctor follow side effect resolve ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study TRC105 Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Inhibition angiogenesis demonstrable antitumor efficacy castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . TRC105 human/murine chimeric immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 ( IgG1 ) kappa monoclonal antibody bind human CD105 ( endoglin ) , thus inhibit angiogenesis tumor growth . Data ongoing phase I clinical trial suggest TRC105 well tolerate evidence clinical efficacy patient metastatic CRPC . Primary Objectives : - Define maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) TRC105 give every one two week . Secondary Objectives : - Define dose-limiting toxicity toxicity profile TRC105 give every one two week - Evaluate time disease progression , overall response rate overall survival . - Describe prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate therapy TRC105 - Characterize pharmacokinetics TRC105 - Demonstrate biologic effect TRC105 patient , possible , tumor via laboratory evaluation molecular marker angiogenesis drug administration respectively Eligibility : - Progressive , castrate-resistant , metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) less equal 2 Design : - An initial single-arm , phase I dose escalation study open patient progressive metastatic CRPC . The study evaluate patient five cohort escalate dose level . A maximum 30 patient need complete phase I evaluation .</detailed_description>
