	<brief_summary>Hepatitis E worldwide disease . It lead second leading cause acute hepatitis adult develop country sub-Saharan Africa Southeast Asia , hyperendemic principally water-borne . In industrialised western country , hepatitis E recently consider imported hyperendemic geographical area , currently emerge autochthonous infectious disease . A grow body data Europe , America , Australia , Asia strongly indicate pig represent major Hepatitis E Virus ( HEV ) reservoir might source zoonotic transmission human direct indirect exposure . Hepatitis E typically cause self-limited acute infection . However , overall death rate 1-4 % , reach 20 % pregnant woman might still high patient underlie chronic liver disease . To date , preventive curative treatment hepatitis E available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Host Responses Kidney-transplant Recipients With Chronic Hepatitis E Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therefore , major goal study analyse first time host response kidney-transplant recipient chronic HEV infection compare host responses kidney-transplant recipient without viral infection ( control ) , identify specific peripheral signature use blood microarray-based gene expression profile . Other minor goal : 1. ass incidence HEV infection kidney-transplant recipient south-eastern France , study risk factor , describe clinical feature outcomes chronic HEV infection kidney-transplant recipient , 2. compare peripheral signature liver signature case liver biopsy available . If peripheral liver signature parallel , peripheral signature may become non-invasive tool exploration chronic HEV infection kidney-transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
