	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect glucocorticoid administration follow traumatic memory reactivation psychiatric symptom veterans combat-related PTSD , addition examine effect glucocorticoid administration follow traumatic memory reactivation physiological response veteran 's personal combat memory . The following hypothesis test : 1 . Subjects receive exogenous glucocorticoid traumatic memory reactivation demonstrate few PTSD depression symptom one week later , compare receive placebo traumatic memory reactivation . 2 . The glucocorticoid reduction effect cumulative ; , reduction persist , post-reactivation glucocorticoid administration reduce symptom 3 . Decreases PTSD depression symptom persist 1 , 3 , 6 month subject receive exogenous glucocorticoid compare subject receive placebo 4 . Subjects receive exogenous glucocorticoid traumatic memory reactivation demonstrate decrease physiological response one week later , compare receive placebo traumatic memory reactivation . 5 . As psychological measure , suppression physiological measure demonstrate persistence time accumulation subsequent post-reactivation glucocorticoid administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background information relate research : Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) characterize , among thing , intrusive memory form unwanted image , nightmare , flashback . These memory associate intense distress involve excessive physiological psychological response fear associate stimulus . Prevalence rate combat-related PTSD increase due Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) deployment , estimate risk PTSD service Iraq War 18 % , 11 % Afghanistan . According Pentagon 's mental health taskforce , 38 % soldier , 31 % marine , 49 % National Guard member , 43 % marine reservists show symptom post-traumatic stress disorder psychological problem within three month return active duty . Estimates National Center PTSD suggest 40 % OEF/OIF troop may acquire PTSD . The Department Defense ( DoD ) report 22 % OEF/OIF troop flag PTSD refer follow-up care , record indicate 39,000 OEF/OIF vet treat PTSD December , 2006 . Current research effort explore underlying neurochemical change associate PTSD . Recently , effort focus prevention PTSD person expose trauma administration medication affect underlie neurochemical process . For example , preliminary evidence suggest interference consolidation trauma-related memory use beta-antagonist , propranalol , may prevent PTSD human recent trauma . However , give much 90 % US population expose least one traumatic event lifetime , utility treatment limit logistical problem treat everyone risk develop PTSD trauma . To date , systematic study human focus change underlie traumatic memory PTSD establish . The trauma experience initially store short-term memory , consolidated long-term memory . However , long-term stability confer consolidation process undergoes period labiality follow . Each time consolidated memory activate , memory trace become newly labile must consolidate remain long-term memory . This process call reconsolidation . Reconsolidation therefore offer biologic window long-term memory disrupt . Preclinical study begin unravel biological change underlie process . Both pharmacological agent , include glucocorticoid , protein synthesis inhibitor interfere memory consolidation reconsolidation . Endogenously produce stress-hormones , glucocorticoid , enhance consolidation emotionally-arousing experience , effect dependent dose , aversiveness task , time hormone administration . Conversely , glucocorticoid appear impair retrieval memory aversive experiences.10 Recent data also suggest glucocorticoid enhance extinction traumatic memory . Preclinical work laboratory UT Southwestern Medical Center establish corticosterone dose-dependently reduce establish fear memory rodent . In study , mouse train associate foot-shock specific train context induce fear memory . When fear memory reactivate contextual stimulus follow glucocorticoid administration , subsequent reactivation fear memory produce significantly less fear response relative mouse administer saline memory reactivation . After one pair reactivation glucocorticoid , effect reversible subthreshold reminder shock transient , indicate effect glucocorticoid extinction process . These result strongly suggest glucocorticoid treatment pair therapeutic traumatic memory reactivation specific therapy PTSD human directly inform pilot study PTSD patient .</detailed_description>
