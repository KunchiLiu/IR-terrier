	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE : To determine whether long-term maintenance program respiratory rehabilitation , contrast usual minimal maintenance therapy , improve cost-effectiveness : a.- maintaining long term effect term effort capacity , HRQL , reduce exacerbation b.- reduce total cost care patient , largely reduction exacerbation . MATERIAL AND METHODS : multi-center ( 4 hospital ) prospective randomize controlled study include 150 patient moderate-severe COPD ( age &lt; 75 ; BODE 4-10 ) 3 year follow-up . All patient receive initial in-hospital rehabilitation program include : Education , Physiotherapy , low upper extremity train respiratory muscle train . Following completion program , patient undergo conceal randomization one two maintenance strategies:1.-an intensive maintenance program ( GR1 ) 2.- standard , minimal monitoring program ( GR2 ) . On intensive maintenance program ( GR1 ) physiotherapist call week reminder patient attend hospital week . A physiotherapist supervise weekly in-hospital exercise he/she check patient properly undergoing rehabilitation treatment . OUTCOMES : 1.- Clinical : dyspnea ( area CRQ questionnaire ) , HRQL ( CRQ , SF 36 ) ; Effort capacity ( 6minute Walking Test ) , BODE index ; 2.- Economical : direct cost ( program ) ; indirect cost ( exacerbation , admission ) ; comparison GR1 GR2 cost ; EXPECTED OUTCOMES : reduction dyspnea , improvement HRQL , effort capacity BODE index , reduction health expenditure GR1 compare GR2 .</brief_summary>
