	<detailed_description>Response Assessment Mantle Cell Lymphoma Based International Workshop Standardize Response Criteria non-hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) ( Cheson , JCO 1999 ) complete hematologic remission define follow : - Disappearance evidence disease . - Any positron emission tomography ( PET ) + mass prior therapy must PET negative treatment . - No palpable spleen liver - If bone marrow involvement prior therapy , must document clear bone marrow . Partial response define : - No new area disease clinical exam regression previous area disease - Greater equal 50 % decrease size prior disease area per measurement compute tomography ( CT ) scan - No new PET+ area PET scan - No increase size liver spleen Response Assessment CLL Using National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) criterion , complete hematologic remission define follow present 2 month : - Absence symptom attributable CLL - Normal finding physical examination - Absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 4000/microL - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/microL - Platelet count &gt; 100,000/microL - Hemoglobin concentration &gt; 11 g/dL ( untransfused ) - Bone marrow lymphocytosis &lt; 30 percent - No nodule ( lymphoid aggregate ) bone marrow biopsy A partial response per NCI criterion define follow 2 month : - A reduction previously enlarge node , spleen , liver · least 50 percent - Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/microL - Platelet count ≥100,000/microL - Hemoglobin concentration ≥11 g/dL - 50 percent improvement pretherapy reduction hemoglobin concentration and/or platelet count</detailed_description>
