	<brief_summary>This exploratory trial four cross-over arm measure pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile growth hormone use two different mode growth hormone administration ( subcutaneous infusion abdomen subcutaneous bolus injection thigh ) 8 adult male female patient growth hormone deficiency interval exercise supine rest . The order dose regimen within group group randomise . All patient go four different treatment session : A/B Single subcutaneous bolus injection , supine rest without/with interval exercise , session C/D : Continuous subcutaneous infusion , supine rest without/with interval exercise . Hypotheses : 1 ) There day-to-day variation exogenous growth hormone , 2 ) Concentration growth hormone decrease due exercise compare supine rest , 3 ) There circadian variation pharmacokinetics exogenous growth hormone infuse subcutaneously</brief_summary>
