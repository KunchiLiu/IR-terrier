	<brief_title>The Use Specialised Amino Acid Mixture Pressure Ulcer Wound Healing Rates- A Placebo Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcer define area localise damage skin , muscle underlying tissue , cause shear , friction unrelieved pressure , usually bony prominence . They associate many health condition cause prolong bed rest , immobility , inactivity poor sensation significantly contribute morbidity mortality , particularly age population . International prevalence rate range widely 4.6 % - 83.6 % due methodological difference classification system . In Singapore , study prevalence pressure ulcer 3 hospital reveal prevalence 9 % 14 % . Pressure ulcer often fail heal timely orderly manner , result chronic non-healing wound . Many intrinsic extrinsic factor identify disrupt wound heal process haemostasis , inflammation , proliferation , angiogenesis remodelling . One factor gain interest impact wound heal process nutritional status . Arginine semi-essential amino acid even though body normally make enough , supplementation sometimes need critical illness severe trauma . There numerous research study focus use arginine enhance wound heal pressure ulcer prevention . It require promotion nitrogen balance , cell proliferation , T lymphocyte function collagen accumulation . It also change nitric oxide , know vasodilatory angiogenic property . Glutamine conditionally essential amino acid manufacture body , extreme physical stress demand glutamine exceed body 's ability make . Adequate amount glutamine generally obtain diet alone body also able make glutamine . Certain medical condition , include injury , surgery , infection , prolong stress , deplete glutamine level . Since glutamine play key role immune system , deficiency nutrient significantly slow healing process . Beta-hydroxy-Beta methylbutyrate ( HMB ) metabolite leucine , essential amino acid . HMB supplementation associate increased muscle mass accretion . HMB appear assert effect via inhibit muscle proteolysis modulate protein turnover . Recently , arginine find accelerate wound heal combination HMB glutamine . It show healthy subject supplement orally arginine significant rise plasma arginine ornithine level lead enhanced rate collagen synthesis . In another recent study , HMB/Arginine/Lysine mixture increase protein turnover elderly patient year long period . However , know randomise control trial do patient chronic hard heal wound acute healthcare setting . AIM To compare pressure ulcer heal rate patient supplement commercial HMB/Arginine/Lysine mixture ( Abound ) standard high protein , high energy iso-nitrogenous medical nutritional supplement versus patient supplement standard high protein , high energy iso-nitrogenous medical nutritional supplement . OUTCOME INDICATORS - Percentage change wound size ( length , depth , area ) - Percentage change proportion viable wound tissue ( Refer wound data collection detail ) The study take comparative , randomise control trial design .</detailed_description>
