A major cause hearing loss exposure high level sound , refer Noise Induced Hearing Loss ( NIHL ) . Veterans inevitably expose high level sound military service , even though may yet NIHL , ears damage . Continued noise exposure civilian life result NIHL . However , easily prevent avoid noise use hear protection . Most people unaware noise damage hearing , even , use hear protection . In study use randomize controlled trial evaluate short- long-term effectiveness two form education NIHL develop Veterans . One computerized program ; Hearing Conservation Brochure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hearing loss tinnitus two prevalent service-connected disability VA system Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) Veterans , Veterans World War II , Korea , Vietnam , Gulf War Peacetime . Costs associate health care utilization , provision hearing aid , rehabilitation service reduce productivity Veterans hear loss substantial , continue increase . On personal level , hear loss result communication difficulty , often contribute social isolation , frustration depression . A major cause hear impairment cochlear damage exposure high level sound . The long period exposure intense sound pressure level , great damage occur . The damage noise exposure cumulative time , exacerbate effect age . Veterans , expose high level sound military therefore highly vulnerable damage civilian life , thus must protect ear noise avoid hear loss age . Unfortunately , people unaware damage noise auditory system , even aware , choose use hearing protection . It therefore critical educate Veterans danger noise exposure simple action take protect hearing . Our long-range goal disseminate effective hearing loss prevention education program help reduce prevalence associate cost noise induce hearing loss Veteran population . Ultimately intention make program available Veterans , military personnel member public . We develop two form intervention educate Veterans hear conservation . One computerized multimedia interactive program ; print Hearing Conservation Brochure . Both provide information hearing , damage noise auditory system , impact hearing loss communication , use hear protection . In study use randomize controlled trial evaluate effectiveness two form intervention change knowledge , attitude behavior toward hear conservation . Effectiveness examine three way assessment : ( 1 ) actual behavioral change , evidence decrease daily noise exposure measure noise dosimetry ; ( 2 ) report behavioral change , evidence decrease daily noise exposure assess use real-time log daily activity use hear protection ; ( 3 ) increase knowledge , healthy attitude improve intend actual behavior towards hear protection , assess self-report questionnaire . Outcomes measured baseline , immediately follow intervention six month post-intervention . There many challenge face military personnel reintegrate society leave military service . Reducing risk acquire noise induce hearing loss associate problem communication , help make transition less difficult traumatic . This study provide important information relative effectiveness two different form hear conservation education . In long term potential reduce prevalence associate cost hear loss tinnitus among Veterans , demonstrate prevention hearing loss reduce need long-term rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
