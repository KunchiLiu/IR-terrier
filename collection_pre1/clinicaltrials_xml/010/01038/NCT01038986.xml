	<brief_title>A Post-marketing Observational Study Cell Therapy Chronic Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic wound categorize two main group : ( ) chronic ulcer , diabetic foot ulcer , venous leg ulcer pressure ( decubitus ) ulcer ( b ) post-operative traumatic , difficult-to-heal wound , may infect sternal wound infection follow cardiac surgery wound follow abdominal orthopedic surgery . Age , peripheral vascular disease , infection , diabetes mellitus , auto-immune dis. , obesity , cardiac disease , cardiac failure , malnutrition , immunological deficiency , steroid treatment , bed confinement prolonged operation time among cause wound repair delay failure often result considerable morbidity mortality . In addition , wound lengthen hospital stay , significantly increase cost care , negatively impact quality life patient care giversCurrently available wound care product include various dressing , ointment , gel , antiseptic agent device . These product intend supply suitable environment wound healing ( e.g . moist environment , particular factor require heal process ) , provide adequate solution grow problem chronic wound . Macrocure develop advanced cellular therapy wound heal name Curexcell™ . Curexcell™ provide natural environment wound healing , also ensure appropriate cell activity factor secretion maintain required stage wound heal . The product contain primed/activated Monocytes , Neutrophils Lymphocytes derive whole blood unit , key role player normal natural wound heal process . The cell inject locally wound bed . The propose study post-marketing observational study ( PMOS ) decision use Curexcell™ treatment patient chronic and/or refractory wound make local physician . Curexcell™ administer patient accordance Instructions Use . In PMOS , control investigator respect patient , duration frequency follow-up method patient manage general . This design truly reflect real-life circumstance .</detailed_description>
