	<brief_summary>Background : - Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChRs ) primary target action nicotine . In addition involve tobacco dependence , also involved variety brain disorder , include Alzheimer 's Parkinson 's disease . Researchers interested develop good way study action nAChRs improve treatment smoke cessation problem affect receptor . These new study method may involve different approach positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning , show brain activity related nAChRs . Objectives : - To evaluate appropriate useful dos radiotracers use PET scan nAChRs brain nonsmokers/former smoker , light smoker , heavy smoker . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age fall one follow group : ( 1 ) nonsmoker former smoker smoke past 2 year , ( 2 ) light/situational smoker , ( 3 ) heavy smoker ( least 15 cigarettes/day past 2 year ) . Design : - Each participant undergo three PET study , give approximately1 month apart . Each study take approximately 8 hour complete . - Participants provide urine breath sample study start study , test chemical may interfere study . - Depending study , smoke participant may receive nicotine patch wear PET scan . - On day study , participant receive dose radiotracer ( drug use PET scan ) give either single injection injection follow continuous infusion , series PET scan next 7 hour provide blood sample time . - Participants return follow-up visit 1 month end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitation Human Cerebral Nicotinie Receptors With 218FFA-85380 PET Healthy Non-smokers Ex-Smokers Heavy Light Situational Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChRs ) mediate variety brain function implicate pathophysiology Alzheimer 's Parkinson 's disease , CNS disorder ( Tourette 's syndrome , epilepsy , etc . ) , nicotine dependence . These receptor primary target action nicotine , believe cause tobacco dependence . The ability quantitatively image nAChRs PET human would allow scientist monitor nAChRs vivo nicotine dependence smoking cessation determine receptor occupancy nicotine different type nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) . Recently complete study demonstrate feasibility image nAChRs human brain 2 [ 18F ] FA-85380 show participant could receive 4 injection 5 mCi/70 kg without exceed dosimetry limit impose FDA NIH Radiation Safety Committee . Scientific Goal : The aim propose study 1 ) compare total volume distribution 2 [ 18F ] FA-85380 volume distribution specific bind compartment ( estimate nAChR density ) brain light heavy smoker 2 ) develop simplify PET procedure comfortable human participant maintain ability accurately quantify nAChR bind vivo . Study Population : Healthy adult participant ( non-smokers exsmokers light ( situational ) heavy smoker ) , males female 18 50 year age , recruit study . The goal complete study 12 control ( non-smokers exsmokers ) , 12 light smoker 12 heavy smoker . Experimental Design Method : After medically clear give informed consent , participant undergo three PET study . In study , participant receive 5 mCi/70 kg dose radioligand , 2 [ 18F ] FA-85380-Injection . For one study , participant smoke receive nicotine nicotine patch ( Nicoderm ) , apply approximately 4 h scan . The patch remove 12 h apply . For two study ( one without one nicotine ) , participant smoke receive radioligand bolus injection . Six participant currently smoke ( control group ) receive radioligand bolus injection twice without nicotine either time . For third study , participant receive radioligand bolus injection follow continuous infusion ( bolus injection/infusion combination ) . Six participant currently smoke ( control group ) receive radioligand bolus plus infusion injection twice . For study , series brain PET scan acquire 8 h beginning time injection . The data PET scan without nicotine patch ( smoker ) use determine total non-specific accumulation radioactivity brain . The data equivalent two PET scan control used determine test-retest reliability measure . The data PET scan acquire bolus/infusion paradigm use demonstrate feasibility shorter scan period quantitation study . It anticipate several participant choose continue first scan . The study design accommodate expectation . Benefits participant and/or society : This protocol provide direct benefit research participant routine medical screen attention research staff . The knowledge gain study may lead availability agent external monitoring nAChRs use PET . This agent would valuable tool determine dynamic nAChRs nicotine dependence smoking cessation . Risks participant : There risk related PET scan general , involve exposure radiation , arterial catheterization venous catheterization . In addition , risk related administration radiopharmaceutical exposure nicotine . Medical supervision provide throughout study . A plan monitor potential side effect radiotracer give .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Subjects male female volunteer age 18 50 year . All subject must stable point contact must agree participate three PET study approximately 4week interval . All participant light heavy smoker group must smoke experience . Those heavy smoker group must smoke least 15 cigarettes/day smoke least last 2 consecutive year . Those participant light smoker group situational smoker ( often smoke consume alcohol another type situation , smoke daily ) . Light smoker smoke 1 cigarette week start medical screening process agree smoke week first PET study ( except single cigarette ask smoke ) . Participants heavy smoker group experience abstain smoke least 48 h. Subjects control group must nonsmoker cease smoke least two year start study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Weight : Anyone weigh 300 lb exclude study . Psychiatric disease : DSMIV criterion use ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) . No subject current axis I diagnosis allow . No subject know claustrophobia allow . History Drug Abuse : Volunteers report current significant history illicit drug abuse ( single illicit substance use 30 time lifetime give substance , except marijuana ) exclude study . However , use great 10 time lifetime , must occur 10 year enrollment protocol . Subjects may use moderate amount alcohol caffeine smoke occasional marijuana cigarette . Moderate alcohol use define less fourteen drink liquor ( 1.5 oz ) equivalent beer ( 12 oz ) wine ( 5 oz ) per week . Moderate caffeine use define less 500 mg caffeine per day , 100 mg equivalent 1 serve coffee ( 5 oz serve ) , 2.5 serving ( 12 oz serve ) caffeinated soft drink , 2.5 serving tea ( 5 oz serve ) . Occasional marijuana use define less equal two marijuana cigarettes/month . Current Medication Use : Volunteers may currently use chronic ( daily 10/14 day last month ) prescription counter medication , ( include , limited , antihypertensive , antiallergy , pain ) . CNS disease : History know structural brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasm , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , history head trauma ( define document loss consciousness &gt; 5 min injury require hospitalization ) , history seizure adult , sleep apnea . Cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic disease : Repeated ( measure three separate occasion ) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg , systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg , know arrhythmia , symptomatic know coronary artery disease ; history endocarditis , cerebral embolism , obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , active tuberculosis , know endocrine disease ( derangement adrenal , thyroid , bone reproductive function ) know chronic renal hepatic dysfunction , know HIV seropositive , know current autoimmune disease involve CNS , type I diabetes mellitus , current gastrointestinal disease , gastritis ulcer . Special consideration female subject . Female participant currently pregnant nursing allow participate study potential damage fetus baby radiation . Female subject give serum pregnancy test ( quantitative beta HCG ) within 24 hour PET study . Radiation exposure : Any subject participate research study he/she receive radiation exposure would result combination present study , total effective radiation exposure ( research study ) exceed 3.0 rem 13week period 5.0 rem year . Lack bilateral arterial patency : Evidence inadequate patency radial lunar artery , determine either Doppler flow measurement positive Allen 's test , exclusionary criterion insertion arterial catheter . Women pregnant lactate child age 18 exclude avoid unnecessary exposure radiation population .
