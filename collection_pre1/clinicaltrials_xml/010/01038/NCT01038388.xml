	<brief_title>A Study Combination Vorinostat With Lenalidomide , Bortezomib Dexamethasone Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate clinical effectiveness side effect vorinostat , bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone investigational combination . All drug - vorinostat , bortezomib , lenalidomide dexamethasone , approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) . They approve combination use type cancer type cancer . Vorinostat approve treatment patient different type cancer ( Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma ) . Bortezomib currently approve treatment multiple myeloma . Lenalidomide currently approve treatment certain type myelodysplastic syndrome ( another form cancer affect blood ) use dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma receive least one prior therapy . Dexamethasone commonly use , either alone , combination drug , treat multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>
