	<detailed_description>Recent clinical study show oxytocin ( OT ) , next long-time know action ( lactation , satiety ) , participate regulation social behavior . Swaab al 1995 show significant reduction number volume neuron express OT paraventricular nucleus PWS patient . Recent data suggest link OT autistic pathology : existence lower plasmatic rate OT association polymorphism OT 's receptor autistics patient . Because OT role pro-social behavior nervous control stress , hypothesis deficit OT would play role abnormality social behavior advance . Moreover , certain feature autistic spectrum disorder find PWS patient . Moreover , recent study show OT administer intra-nasal spray reduce psychosocial stress increase confidence healthy volunteer . The PWS genetic pathology clinical feature similar autistic pathology .

The hospital routinely receive PWS adult 4 week stay give optimal condition establishment study . Patients separate 2 group match one one sex IQ . One group receive OT , placebo . Forty five minute inhalation , patient evaluate social comprehension thanks psychometric test . Furthermore , analysis base observation sheet allow u score daily stress , anxiety eat behavior . These sheet serve comparison 2 day 2 day nasal spray described scoring component .
