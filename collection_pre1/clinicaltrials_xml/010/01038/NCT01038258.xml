	<brief_title>Monitoring Response After The First Chemotherapy Cycle After Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use neo-adjuvant systemic therapy woman recently diagnose breast cancer grow popularity base proven benefit ( 1 ) . Pre-operative chemotherapy assist regard breast conservation therapy ( 2 ) data suggest prognostic benefit subset patient 's obtain complete pathological response ( 3,4 ) . It imperative clinician detect early possible patient likely obtain desired clinical /or pathologic response , thus identify patient n't benefit first line neoadjuvant treatment treatment modify accordingly . Response treatment base clinical data structural imaging , usually require several chemotherapeutic cycle establish degree effectiveness ( 5 ) . Lately , FDG-PET/CT use different type neoplasm , breast cancer among , establish early response treatment ( 6,7 ) . Recent data establish usefulness metabolic analysis via FDG-PET , separate subgroup chemotherapy . For analytical approach , sequential estimation SUVs ( Standardized Uptake Value ) measure along duration treatment . Reduction SUVs presume adequate response treatment ( 8 ) , little change metabolic activity presume sub-optimal response . However , definite consensus establish regard degree metabolic response predictive desire clinical benefit , particularly early treatment . Establishing criterion could potentially serve guideline monitoring neoadjuvant treatment . Schelling et al , able separate group patient eventually show either progression disease clinical response early first course chemotherapy . The aim study establish simple formula use FDG-PET/CT , early first course chemotherapy , stratify patient undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy recently diagnose breast cancer . Those benefit continue treatment regard responder versus non-responders , need change strategy . The primary goal study correlate result FDG-PET/CT perform 15 day first course chemotherapy versus clinical assessment breast MRI obtain 3rd course chemotherapy . At time , clinical decision therapeutic path follow make .</detailed_description>
