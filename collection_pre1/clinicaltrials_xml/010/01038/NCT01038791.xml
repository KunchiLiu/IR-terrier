	<brief_title>Patients-ventilator Interaction During Sleep : Effect Humidification System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Non-invasive mechanical ventilation ( NIMV ) , usually deliver night time , widely use home chronic hypercapnic respiratory , patient COPD restrictive thoracic disease ( RTD ) . The aim chronic NIMV improve daytime arterial blood gas , sleep quality decreasing symptom hypoventilation ( mainly sleep ) , quality life mood . Scarce data available NIMV compliance home ; poor compliance may reduce positive effect mechanical ventilation . Previous data show patient enrol long-term home ventilation program may drop early , mainly skin irritation , upper airway problem , air leak . Studies perform patient sleep apnea , receive CPAP therapy home , show occurrence leak ventilation cause development mucosal inflammation , nasal congestion increase nasal airway resistance . On hand , presence development nasal obstruction make arise worsen air leak ( vicious cycle ) reliable . A lack humidification may increase nasal resistance nasal symptom , therefore , contribute reduction compliance . Furthermore , leak may significant consequence inspiratory expiratory trigger function , induce poor patient-ventilator interaction . Indeed , presence ineffective effort , common phenomenon bad patient-ventilation interaction , common patient receive long term home ventilation usually associate poor gas exchange sleep . At present , little data available medical literature regard affect humidification NIMV efficacy , sleep quality upper airway symptom patient undergo nocturnal NIMV . The aim present pilot study assess impact two humidification system sleep quality , NIMV efficacy , patient-ventilator interaction , prevalence NIMV side effect , compliance treatment , group stable patient already enrol long-term nocturnal mechanical ventilation program chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure sleep hypoventilation . PATIENTS We plan enrol 20 patient chronic respiratory failure sleep hypoventilation already include long-term home non-invasive ventilation program ( least 3 month ) . Inclusion criteria Patients stable condition ( acute exacerbation 4 week enrolment ) , well adapt ventilation without problem ventilation mask . Exclusions criteria Patients acute respiratory failure , recent exacerbation , severe co-morbidities ( i.e . hearth failure , recent stroke etc . ) Recent upper airways surgery . Allergic rhinitis , severe nasal stenosis . STUDY DESIGN Patients undergo three consecutive nocturnal polysomnographs . Patients baseline therapy NIMV without humidification 1 week . They undergo nocturnal polysomnograph last evening baseline therapy . Patients randomly assign use HH HME 1 week undergo nocturnal polysomnography last evening . The patient assign second method humidification 1 week undergo third nocturnal polysomnograph last evening . The whole evaluation perform ventilator ( ideally patient 's device ) use patient 's mask usual ventilator set . Measures At enrolment : Lung function test Standard questionnaire use tolerability NIMV home Measure NIMV compliance home Blood gas analysis wakefulness ( spontaneous breathe - SB - NIMV ) The breathing pattern wakefulness ( SB NIMV ) Polysomnographic evaluation Full standard assist polysomnography simultaneous recording Tidal Volume , Leaks , pressure mask , respiratory rate , instantaneous minute ventilation . Analysis sleep data perform accord standard criterion ( AASM 2007 ) . Analysis breathe pattern patients-ventilator interaction make accord previous publish method ( Fanfulla , Tuggey , Techsler etc.. ) . At end PSG recording , patient ask humidification NIMV tolerance well presence upper airway symptom ( Nava et al ) .</detailed_description>
