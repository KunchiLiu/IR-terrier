	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine perform endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) addition standard endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) increase precision accuracy stag esophageal cancer comparison EUS alone . The expectation EBUS use biopsy lymph node : ( 1 ) position mediastinum would inaccessible EUS , ( 2 ) would inaccessible due position behind esophageal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endobronchial Ultrasound ( EBUS ) Nodal Staging Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Problem : Endoscopic ultrasound technique become popular . The safety technology demonstrate multiple occasion . These minimally invasive trans-luminal technique require general anesthesia perform , rapidly , accurately low cost . Endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) use pulmonologists thoracic surgeon primarily stag , diagnosis management lung cancer . Its efficacy safety demonstrate multiple study . EBUS currently utilize center stag esophageal cancer . To date , study explore possible use EBUS peritumoral lymph node biopsy , biopsy suspicious mediastinal lymph node , accessible EUS . At Notre Dame Hospital , Centre Hospitalier de L'Universite de Montreal , patient diagnose esophageal cancer undergo complete EUS staging follow EBUS procedure , order examine lymph node near far primary tumor amenable EBUS guide trans-bronchial biopsy . This important allows physician bypass primary tumor pas normal ( non-cancerous ) bronchial wall , eliminate chance tumoral contamination sample . In addition , also provide much complete mediastinal staging allow biopsy population lymph node non-accessible EUS biopsy . Thus far , perform EBUS six patient esophageal cancer upstage N stage tumor two patient ( 33 % ) . There morbidities patient discharge home day procedure . EBUS therefore able change treatment strategy , without add morbidity , discomfort additional procedural time two six patient . The propose project first study ever evaluate impact EBUS esophageal cancer stag well choice therapy . This study consist prospective cohort study placebo group , patient EBUS stage obtain without EBUS compare well change treatment plan base EBUS stag . 2 . Objectives : - Examine impact add EBUS gold standard work-up esophageal cancer stag . - Examine impact add EBUS gold standard work-up treatment plan patient newly diagnose esophageal cancer . 3 . Methodology : The study consist prospective cohort study . Each patient serve his/her control . All patient currently undergo esophageal cancer stag Division Thoracic Surgery CHUM approach enrolment study . EUS follow EBUS perform EUS stag procedure . The order procedures patient follow : ( 1 ) Flexible Esophagoscopy endoluminal biopsy , ( 2 ) Radial EUS T staging ( 3 ) Linear EUS lymph node biopsy N staging , ( 4 ) Flexible Bronchoscopy evaluation leave mainstem bronchus tumor invasion , ( 5 ) Linear EBUS trans-tracheal trans-bronchial lymph node biopsy . All FNA sample evaluate use standard method cytopathologists CHUM . Results evaluate : ( A ) positivity , ( B ) negativity ( tumor cell , positive lymphocyte ) , ( C ) inadequacy ( tumor cell , lymphocyte ) . A minimum two pass perform lymph node . Patients discharge day , procedure . Results discuss follow-up clinic appointment thoracic surgeon within 3 week procedure . Any procedure-related morbidity document post-procedural period well follow-up appointment . 4 . Expected Results : We believe add EBUS gold standard work stag esophageal cancer , make significant difference esophageal cancer stag . This may also significantly change choice therapy .</detailed_description>
