	<brief_title>5-Azacytidine With Lenalidomide Patients With High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Azacitidine design block certain protein stop function tumor-fighting gene . By block `` bad '' protein , tumor-fighting gene may able work well . Lenalidomide design change immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 6 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase 1 portion study , 40 participant enrol Phase 2 . If enrolled Phase 1 portion , dose lenalidomide receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level lenalidomide . Each new group receive high dose lenalidomide group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose lenalidomide find . If enrolled Phase 2 portion , receive lenalidomide high dose tolerate Phase 1 portion . All participant receive dose level azacitidine . Study Drug Administration : Each study `` cycle '' 3-8 week , depend well tolerate drug , side effect may , blood count bone marrow recovers . On Days 1-5 every cycle , receive azacitidine vein 15-30 minute . In order participate study must register follow requirement Revlimid REMS™ program Celgene Corporation . This program provide education counsel risk fetal exposure , blood clot reduce blood count . You require receive counseling every 28 day treatment lenalidomide , follow pregnancy test birth control requirement program appropriate take telephone survey regard compliance program . If enrolled Phase 2 study , Days 6-15 every cycle , take capsule lenalidomide mouth . You swallow lenalidomide capsule whole cup ( 8 ounce ) water time day . Do break , chew , open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide , seek emergency medical care need contact study staff right away . Any unused lenalidomide return instructed RevAssist® program . Any woman become pregnant wear glove touch lenalidomide capsule . You inform risk birth defect . If female , agree become pregnant take lenalidomide . For reason , lenalidomide provide patient special distribution program call Revlimid REMSTM . Your dose study drug may lower experience side effect . You may give drug help prevent side effect , nausea , vomit , and/or diarrhea . The doctor tell drug may receive . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask drug and/or treatment may receive side effect may . One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Days 21 28 Cycle 1 ( +/- 3 day ) , bone marrow aspiration perform check status disease . You bone marrow aspiration perform every 7-14 day rest study . If point disease appear go remission , bone marrow aspiration perform every 1-3 cycle . Before Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Pregnancy Testing : If woman able become pregnant , blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test 1 time week first 4 week study , every 4 week study , stop study , 4 week study . If woman able become pregnant menstrual cycle irregular , blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test 1 time week first 4 week , every 2 week study , stop study , 2 4 week study . Length Study : You may continue receive azacitidine long doctor think best interest . You may receive lenalidomide part study long benefit . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . This investigational study . Both azacitidine lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available treatment AML . The combination use study investigational . Up 88 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
