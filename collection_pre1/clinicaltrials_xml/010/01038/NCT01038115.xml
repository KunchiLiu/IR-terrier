	<brief_summary>The purpose study perform prospective , randomise study investigate safety efficacy cryoballoon catheter ablation compare radiofrequency ablation , together treatment paroxysmal AF . The hypothesis study ( 1 ) cryothermal energy effective safe use radiofrequency energy treatment paroxysmal AF associate well long term outcome , ( 2 ) use cryothermy RF combination effective safe use either radiofrequency energy cryothermy alone associate good long term outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Pulmonary Vein Isolation With Cryoballoon , Radiofrequency Energy , Both Treatment Atrial Fibrillation ( AF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary vein isolation important treatment patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , particularly antiarrhythmic drug ineffective tolerate . One method involve use radiofrequency energy 3-D mapping system produce series lesion ( small burn area ) within heart . Another method involve pass balloon ( call cryoballoon ) heart freeze part heart muscle vein drain . Both method appear effective know data . However , know use either method alone together effective . We aim perform prospective , randomized clinical trial compare three strategy . Substudy 1 : Use cardiac MRI evaluate ablation lesion . Some patient also ask undergo MRI scan heart ablation procedure , three month one year follow procedure . This allow u examine potential role MRI image scar tissue form ablation , help u understand time course scar formation change part heart follow ablation . Substudy 2 : Platelet reactivity activation AF , impact curative ablation . Blood urine sample take pre- 3 month post ablation see platelet reactivity activation affect AF compare establish normal range , whether curative ablation impact .</detailed_description>
