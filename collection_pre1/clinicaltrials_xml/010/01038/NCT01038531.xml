	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) represent spectrum clinical syndrome rapid respiratory system deterioration associate pulmonary systemic illness . These syndrome associate 30-40 % mortality current standard care responsible approximately 75,000 death US yearly . Current evidence-based care ALI consist strategy mechanical ventilation utilize low lung volume ( ARDSNet ventilation ) intend limit stretch-induced lung injury exacerbate ventilator . However , strategy show associate increased lung injury subset patient still associate 30 % mortality rate . Airway pressure release ventilation ( APRV ) different , non-experimental strategy mechanical ventilation currently routine clinical use . APRV pressure-cycled ventilator mode allow patient great degree autonomy control breathe pattern ARDSNet ventilation . Use APRV associate good oxygenation , less sedative usage , less ventilator-associated pneumonia small study compare ventilator mode . However , debate exists whether APRV might result decrease increased ventilator-associated lung injury compare ARDSNet ventilation . We intend implement randomize , cross study look biomarkers lung injury patient acute lung injury ventilation APRV use ARDSNet protocol . Our hypothesis airway pressure release ventilation associate low level lung injury biomarkers ARDSNet ventilation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) represent spectrum clinical syndrome rapid respiratory system deterioration associate pulmonary systemic illness . These syndrome associate 30-40 % mortality current standard care responsible approximately 75,000 death US yearly . The current evidence-based care consist strategy mechanical ventilation utilize low lung volume ( ARDSNet ventilation ) intend limit lung injury overstretch lung induce ventilator . However , strategy show associate continued lung injury study still associate 30 % mortality rate . Airway pressure release ventilation ( APRV ) different , nonexperimental strategy mechanical ventilation currently routine clinical use . APRV allow patient great degree autonomy control his/her breathe achieve high mean airway pressure ( similar plateau pressure ) typically achieve ARDSNet . APRV associate less ventilator-associated pneumonia , good oxygenation , less sedative usage small study compare method ventilation . However , debate exists net effect APRV regard ventilator-associated lung injury . Additionally , recently complete study show APRV associate low ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) rate , benefit appear mediate sedation difference . We hypothesize VAP benefit might mediate great lung recruitment possibly less ventilator-induced lung injury APRV . We propose randomize , crossover study look biomarkers lung injury patient acute lung injury ventilate APRV ARDSNet . Our hypothesis airway pressure release ventilation associate low level lung injury biomarkers ARDSNet ventilation .</detailed_description>
