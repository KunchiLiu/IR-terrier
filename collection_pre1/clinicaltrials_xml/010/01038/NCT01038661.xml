	<brief_summary>The Primary Objective evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . The secondary objective : - To compare disease control rate different dos Docetaxel+Cisplatin first-line treatment accord Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ; - To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) ; - To evaluate time disease progression ( TTP ) ; - To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) ; - To evaluate toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist : - A first line treatment phase : participant receive 4 cycle chemotherapy ( cycle contain 3 week ) either docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 ) plus cisplatin ( 75 mg/m2 ) docetaxel ( 60 mg/m2 ) plus cisplatin ( 75 mg/m2 ) , - A maintenance treatment phase : participant disease control ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] stable disease [ SD ] ) initial treatment receive 6 cycle chemotherapy docetaxel ( 60 mg/m2 ) best supportive care ( BSC ) . - A follow-up period end study treatment participant death end study .</detailed_description>
