	<brief_summary>Smoking cessation often difficult smoker achieve variety reason include : difficulty nicotine withdrawal , failure perceive benefit smoke cessation , failure perceive risk associate smoking . We argue effective biomarkers affect perception harm , especially lung cancer , signal progression towards disease development Proposed pilot study educate smoker role genetics lung cancer Durham VA out-patient clinic . The goal pilot study assess interest study participation VA smoke population , well determine fraction subject complete study power future large trial . Interested patient receive 15 minute educational presentation function p16 role development lung cancer . They assess airway obstruction hand-held spirometry follow review questionnaire assess understanding present information , concern develop lung cancer , desire quit smoking . All patient offer smoke cessation assistance point . Enrolled patient give 3 sputum cup take home return morning sputum sample mail . Samples assess evidence p16 methylation patient informed result . Follow-up phone interview perform 2 4 week patient receive result mail ass understanding result , desire stop smoking . A final phone interview occur approximately 3 month sputum test ass attempt stop smoke well patient continue understanding test result .

	<brief_title>p16 Methylation Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States 2007 , ~ 213,380 people expect diagnosed lung cancer , ~ 160,390 expect die disease . Among diagnosed lung cancer , 79 % 90 % cigarette smoker . Overall , ~21 % adult U.S. smoke . The important cost-effective strategy prevention lung cancer mortality smoke avoidance cessation . Smoking cessation often difficult smoker achieve variety reason include : difficulty nicotine withdrawal , failure perceive benefit smoke cessation , failure perceive risk associate smoking . We argue effective biomarkers affect perception harm , especially lung cancer , signal progression towards disease development . Prior development lung cancer , genetic alteration bronchial epithelium . One alteration methylation promoter region Rb-p16 ( p16 ) important regulation G1-S transition cell cycle . Prior study show presence promoter methylation p16 result 2-fold increase risk develop lung cancer smoker evidence airway obstruction . Proposed pilot study educate smoker role genetics lung cancer Durham VA out-patient clinic . The goal pilot study assess interest study participation VA smoke population , well determine fraction subject complete study power future large trial .
