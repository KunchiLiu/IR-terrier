	<brief_summary>This single center , randomize , unblinded study compare rate occlusion plastic , uncovered metal , fully cover metal biliary stent patient 's surgically resectable disease undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . We also compare occlusion rate uncover metal fully cover metal biliary stent patient determine surgically unresectable disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plastic v . Covered Metal v . Uncovered Metal Biliary Stents Management Malignant Biliary Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant biliary obstruction result extrinsic process , proximal pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma metastatic lesion , intrinsic lesion cholangiocarcinoma . Malignant biliary obstruction typically treat endoscopically placement either plastic ( polyethylene ) metal biliary stent . Metal stent wider diameter plastic stent , show high patency rate , also 15-40 time cost plastic stent . Metal stent polymer coating develop prevent tumor ingrowth stent , lead stent occlusion . Cost analysis demonstrate advantage use metal stent patient unresectable disease , may achieve operable status follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy , either plastic stent metal stent use patient deem surgically resectable lesion . Patient 's determined resectable , borderline resectable malignancy ( may achieve resectability status follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) receive either plastic , uncovered metal , cover metal stent randomize fashion , patient determine surgically unresectable malignancy randomly receive either cover uncovered metal biliary stent . The primary aim study prospectively evaluate stent occlusion rate patient present malignant biliary obstruction . Secondary aim study include cost analysis stent type , rate hospital admission follow stent placement , day chemotherapy due procedural complication , rate acute cholecystitis associate stent placement .</detailed_description>
