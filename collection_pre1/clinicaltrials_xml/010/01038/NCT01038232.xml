	<brief_summary>Background : - People treatment substance abuse often feel distress withdrawal period afterward . Some individual feel distress acutely others , distress link poor treatment outcome increase risk relapse smoker , alcoholic , cocaine- heroin-dependent individual . More research need effect distress brain , particularly individual seek treatment substance abuse . Researchers interested use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanning study distress tolerance substance user seek treatment healthy non-drug-using volunteer . Objectives : - To use functional magnetic resonance imaging study effectiveness distress tolerance assessment . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age either cocaine dependent healthy non-drug-using volunteer . Design : - This study involve initial screen visit scan visit , four followup visit . - Participants screen medical history physical examination , well blood sample questionnaires mood past current drug use . - Participants structural MRI scan brain provide baseline reading comparison . Participants fMRI scan session , include distress tolerance assessment relevant control task . Heart rate , blood pressure , physical reaction monitor throughout scan . Participants also provide blood saliva sample measure stress hormone level . - Participants eligible followup assessment fMRI scan 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month scan visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary objective current study implement distress tolerance assessment use fMRI determine neurobiological difference individual low high distress tolerance . Additionally , biological physiological indicator assess , include genetic polymorphism , salivary cortisol , galvanic skin response , blood pressure . The overall hypothesis individual low distress tolerance exhibit hyperactivation extend amygdala hypoactivation prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex experience affective distress failure stressful task , compare individual high distress tolerance . Study Population : The study population consist healthy male female adult volunteer ( 18-55 year old ) , well otherwise healthy sample male female treatment seek substance user cocaine user ( 18-55 year old ) ( see exclusion criterion ) . Experimental Design Methods : After medically clear give write informed consent , participant undergo structural MRI scan brain , undergo fMRI scan session , include administration distress tolerance relevant control task . Physiological response task , include heart rate , blood pressure , galvanic skin conductance , salivary cortisol concentration monitor throughout fMRI scan . Follow-up assessment control cocaine dependent participant occur 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month baseline assessment . Genetic data collect aegis protocol 10-DA-N457 compare data collect study . Outcome Measures : Outcome measure include distress tolerance measure latency second task termination distress tolerance task , neural index distress tolerance ( participant ) , substance use treatment outcome ( cocaine user ) include relapse drug use , latency first cocaine use , number substance use day per week follow-up .</detailed_description>

Have neurological illness include , limited , seizure disorder , migraine , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history head trauma , CVA , CNS tumor . 6 . Control participant : Meet DSMIV criterion past current substance abuse dependence ; use illicit substance last 30 day nicotine use great 10 cigarette per day and/or Fagerstrom score great 3 . 7 . Cocaine use participant : 1 . Nontreatment subject : Meet DSMIV criterion substance dependence substance nicotine cocaine month prior study enrollment . Only ( except nicotine cocaine dependence allow month prior enrollment . Current abuse substance acceptable. ) . While might preferable exclude individual whose use substances reach threshold abuse , inclusion individual necessarily contaminate data . 2 . Inpatient cocaine subject : Those meet DSMIV TR criterion course specifier In Controlled Environment may history dependence substance cocaine admission inpatient treatment program . 8 . Regular use prescription , overthecounter , herbal medication may alter CNS function , cardiovascular function neuronalvascular coupling . Medications could interfere BOLD signal include compound show vasoactive , include alpha agonist , beta blocker , calcium channel blocker . 9 . Have cognitive impairment assess screen WASI vocabulary subtest 48 , correspond full IQ 85 ( case screening , full WASI do verify IQ 85 ) . 10 . Acute drug intoxication positive urine drug screen begin study</criteria>
