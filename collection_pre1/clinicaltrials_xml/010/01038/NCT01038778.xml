	<brief_title>Entinostat Combination With Aldesleukin Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability high dose interleukin 2 ( aldesleukin ) combination entinostat patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To monitor toxicity estimate efficacy high dose aldesleukin combine entinostat patient metastatic RCC . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare time-to-tumor progression , progression-free survival overall survival patient metastatic RCC treat high dose aldesleukin combine entinostat historical data patient treat high dose aldesleukin alone . ( Phase II ) II . To assess toxicity high dose aldesleukin combine entinostat . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate entinostat pharmacodynamics ( PD ) blood tumor sample . ( Phase II ) IV . To measure association baseline laboratory parameter ( e.g . cluster differentiation [ CD ] 4+ , CD8+ , CD4+/forkhead box P3 [ Foxp3 ] ) , tumor blood metabolism , variety response variable ( e.g . toxicity , response survival ) . ( Phase II ) V. To explore relationship entinostat exposure PD endpoint ( e.g . toxicity histone acetylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell peripheral blood mononuclear cell [ PBMNCs ] change T cell subset population ) . ( Phase II ) VI . To evaluate modulation tumor metabolism fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG , fludeoxyglucose F 18 ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study entinostat follow phase II study . Patients receive entinostat orally ( PO ) every 2 week begin day -14 high-dose aldesleukin intravenously ( IV ) every 8 hour day 1-5 15-19 . Courses repeat every 84 days* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients evidence tumor shrinkage may receive 3 course high-dose aldesleukin therapy . Patients stable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.0 criterion , without evidence tumor shrinkage two course receive entinostat disease progression document . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
