In patient atherosclerosis , function endothelium impaired abnormality may contribute development heart attack stroke . Observational study show frequent nut consumption decrease risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , mechanisms benefit fully define . Recent study suggest specific fatty acid flavonoid nut may favorable effect cardiovascular disease . In addition , grow evidence compound may improve function endothelium .
