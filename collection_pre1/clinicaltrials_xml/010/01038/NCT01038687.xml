	<detailed_description>Study period Estimated date first patient enrol : January 2010 Study design This single-center , randomize , parallel group , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose response , pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic study evaluate effect A3309 gastric , intestinal colonic transit patient functional constipation . Doses 10 20 mg A3309 match placebo administer orally daily fourteen ( 14 ) consecutive day . Aim To assess dose related effect A3309 small bowel overall colonic transit bowel function patient functional constipation . Number patient plan Twelve complete female patient functional constipation treatment group total 36 patient . Diagnosis main eligibility criterion Female patient diagnose functional constipation recruit local community public advertisement place within area Mayo Clinic target mail informational letter . Methodology Patients functional constipation screen eligibility inform study pre-screening dialogue also initial Visit 1 screen . Within seven ( 7 ) fourteen ( 14 ) day Visit 1 , eligible patient return abbreviate scintigraphy test image obtain 4 24 hour follow In111 capsule ingestion . A geometric center 24 hour must less equal 2.30 qualify randomization study medication . The assigned medication either 10 20 mg A3309 placebo administer orally daily fourteen ( 14 ) consecutive day . The allocation treatment group conceal . A urine pregnancy test perform female child bear potential Visit 1 within 48 hour prior receipt isotope mouth abbreviate post-study medication transit scintigraphy test Visit 2 Visit 4 . Note female status post-bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy postmenopausal exempt test . Patients take study medication home eleven ( 11 ) consecutive day . Study medication administer Charlton 7 Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) Visit 4 , 5 , 6 , day scintigraphic assessment gastric , small bowel colonic transit solid perform 48 hour period total dosing period fourteen ( 14 ) consecutive day . Within seven ( 7 ) ten ( 10 ) day Visit 6 , patient return Charlton 7 CRU final safety monitoring exit physical examination interview study staff . Investigational product , dosage mode administration Patients take 15 20 mg A3309 placebo administer orally eleven ( 11 ) consecutive day report post-study medication transit scintigraphy day twelve ( 12 ) dosing . Study medication administer In111 capsule Visit 4 immediately camera image obtain Visits 5 6 . Study medication administer Charlton 7 CRU nurse day 12-14 . Duration treatment A3309 match placebo administer orally daily fourteen ( 14 ) consecutive day . Duration patient ' involvement study Each patient attend seven ( 7 ) visit clinic period thirty-one ( 31 ) forty-one ( 41 ) day . Efficacy assessment - Scintigraphic small bowel colonic transit - Assessment stool frequency consistency use Bowel Pattern Diary Pharmacokinetic analysis Blood sample analysis pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter collect Visit 4 , dose 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 210 , 240 minute post-dose . PK parameter analyze . Safety assessments The following safety assessment perform : - Laboratory safety test , include complete blood count ( CBC ) , comprehensive metabolic panel ( CMP ) , coagulation study ( PT APTT ) urinalysis ( UA ) perform Visit 1 study entry , Visit 6 completion transit scintigraphy final dose study medication , Visit 7 study completion . A urine screen drug abuse perform Visit 1 study entry . - A 12-lead ECG perform Visit 1 study entry , Visit 6 completion post-study medication transit scintigraphy Visit 7 study completion . - A physical examination study physician Visit 1 study entry Visit 7 study completion . - Vital sign ( include temperature , pulse , blood pressure respiration rate ) every visit - Urine pregnancy test perform Visit 1 study entry within 48 hour prior receipt radiation abbreviate transit scintigraphy post-study medication transit scintigraphy Visit 2 Visit 4 , respectively - Interview concomitant medication adverse event every visit Statistical method An analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) use compare transit parameter among treatment group . The co-variates consider inclusion analyse age body mass index ( BMI ) . If necessary suitable transformation potential skewness distribution measure volume may use ( e.g. , ANCOVA rank log volume ) . If ANCOVA show p value le equal 0.10 , 10 mg 20 mg dos compare placebo ( p value less equal 0.025 correct 2 pairwise comparison Dunnett 's Test ) . Since secondary endpoint assess separate hypothesis regard effect A3309 , adjustment alpha level test multiple type endpoint anticipate , two-sided significance level 0.05 use ANCOVA model . Statistical Power Based data acquire use method laboratory , sample size 12 patient per group provide 80 % power detect difference approximately 27 % 37 % colonic transit 24 hour , primary endpoint . This magnitude change consider clinically significant . PK analyse Plasma concentration v time curve plot subject , linear/linear log10/linear scale . Mean plasma concentration v time curve also present dose level . Summary statistic ( n , mean , SD , minimum , median , maximum , geometric mean , coefficient variation ) calculate plasma concentration time point dose level . Summary statistic ( n , mean , SD , minimum , median , maximum , geometric mean coefficient variation ) present pharmacokinetic parameter dose level . Geometric mean coefficient variation calculate Tmax . The coefficient variation calculate use follow formula : CV ( % ) = [ exp ( SD2 ) -1 ] 1/2 * 100 SD=standard deviation natural-logarithmically-transformed data . Analysis data set The primary analysis follow intent treat ( ITT ) paradigm patient randomize included analysis . Those patient miss response value miss value impute via overall ( patient non-missing data ) mean correspond adjustment ANCOVA residual error variance degree freedom ( subtract one miss value impute ) . Safety data present patient receive investigational product .</detailed_description>
