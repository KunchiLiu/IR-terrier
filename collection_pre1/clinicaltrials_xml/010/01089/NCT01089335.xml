	<detailed_description>The standard surgical treatment highly differentiate papillary thyroid cancer &gt; 10 mm accord recent national international guideline , total thyroidectomy central lymphnode clearance , patient cytology indicate thyroid neoplasia unclear malignant potential hemithyroidectomy side tumour . There however number clinical problem approach : - For patient papillary thyroid cancer , significant proportion receive unnecessary extensive surgical treatment - In papillary thyroid cancer , central lymphnode clearance increase risk complication , especially risk hypoparathyroidism . According Scandinavian survey ( Scandinavian Quality Register Thyroid- Parathyroid Surgery ; www . thyroid-parathyroidsurgery.com ) ,16 % patient unclear follicular neoplasia , final histological diagnosis thyroid cancer , half , cancer papillary subtype . In patient preoperatively suspect , proven malignancy cytology , 30 % receive final histological diagnosis thyroid cancer , patient , 70 % papillary subtype . Typically patient undergo second operation contralateral hemithyroidectomy . In many case , due risk complication , central lymphnode clearance avoid case . Therefore , stag cancer incomplete , patient receive suboptimal surgical treatment . The study design compare SN investigation final histology central lymphnodes : - Pretracheal bilateral paratracheal patient preoperatively diagnose papillary thyroid cancer - Pretracheal ipsilateral paratracheal tumour uncertain malignant potential cytology The identification SN aid preoperative ultrasound guide injection 99m- Tc- nanocolloid albumin thyroid tumour . The result histological investigation SN compare result central lymphnode clearance .</detailed_description>
