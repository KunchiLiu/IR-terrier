	<detailed_description>In investigator previous study ( Ann Thorac Surg 2002 , 73 : 538-545 ) , investigator know adult patient receive ECMO support post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock , 1/3 would survive discharge , 1/3 could wean ECMO die ECMO support , 1/3 could wean ECMO support , finally die multiple organ failure . However , clinical observation first day ECMO support , would difficult predict outcome specify individual patient . Therefore , investigator usually wait four six day know whether ECMO treatment successful . If investigator could predict result one two day earlier , would give physician enough time make medical decision . Therefore , early parameter could use predict outcome ECMO treatment would valuable . The investigator also find despite obscure clinical presentation , significant difference serum cytokine ' concentration 3rd day ECMO support `` ECMO successful '' `` ECMO failure '' patient . In study , investigator investigate leukocyte free radical activity , oxidation damage marker ( 8-OHdG concentration ) serum , whole blood glutathione peroxidase activity antioxidation , serum IL-6 , IL-12 , IL-8 , IL-10 , transform growth factor-β biochemical concentration immune cellular change period ECMO treatment . Patient 's blood sample 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour ECMO support treatment , ECMO removal ICU discharge collect use study . The measured factor final outcome compare . The investigator hope find early factor change ECMO treatment among biochemical , immunological clinical parameter .</detailed_description>
