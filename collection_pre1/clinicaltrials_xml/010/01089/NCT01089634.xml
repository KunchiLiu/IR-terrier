	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To characterize left ventricular ( LV ) threshold behavior time use daily leave ventricular capture management ( LVCM ) measurement . Study Design : This multicenter , prospective , non-interventional study patient receive first cardiac resynchronisation therapy-implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( CRT-ICD ) device . The study design , base primary objective , observational examination LV threshold time . Daily leave ventricular threshold measurement collect use LVCM feature . Up 150 patient enrol Canada evaluate primary objective 15 study center . Data collect Baseline , Implant , 12 month post-implant regularly schedule follow-up visit 12 month post-implant . Devices : The ConcertoTM CRT-ICD device future Medtronic CRT-ICD device contain LVCM feature use study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I . Study Purpose : The purpose LEARN Study provide information assist clinician manage LV threshold . II . Device Description : The CRT-ICD device use study Therapeutic Products Directorate license , market release Medtronic CRT-ICD device equip LVCM feature . Currently include ConcertoTM CRT Defibrillator . Future Medtronic model equip LVCM feature become Therapeutic Products Directorate license market release future also include . The study allow commercially available lead manufacturer compatible Medtronic CRT-ICD device . Devices program interrogate Medtronic 9790 2090 programmer . Medtronic defibrillator automatically detect treat episode ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) , ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) bradyarrhythmia . When ventricular arrhythmia detect , implantable device deliver defibrillation , cardioversion , anti-tachycardia pace standard pace therapy terminate ventricular arrhythmia . In addition , Medtronic CRT defibrillator , include Concerto , also provide Cardiac Resynchronization therapy . All device study use accord intend use . III . Study Objective : Primary Study Objective : To characterize LV threshold behavior time . IV . Study Scope : 150 patient enrol Canada evaluate primary objective 15 study center . Individual center limit maximum 30 enrollment . Patients follow 12 month period interim visit occur accord regular clinic follow schedule . V. Methodology : A . Study Design This multicenter , prospective , non-interventional study patient receive first CRT-ICD device . The study design , base primary objective , observational examination LV threshold . Patients follow clinic per hospital ICD clinic standard follow schedule mandatory follow-up visit 12 month ( ± 30 day ) post-implant . The following collected 12 month ( ± 30 day ) visit regularly schedule follow-up visit : LV threshold measurement , change cardiovascular medication save disk file . B . Patient Population Inclusion Criteria - Patients implant first CRT defibrillator system . - Patients implanted Medtronic CRT defibrillator contain LVCM feature . - Patients willing able sign IRB/MEC approve patient inform consent . - Patients geographically stable available follow-up study center require follow-up duration study Exclusion Criteria Patients meet follow criterion exclude entry study : - Patients pre-existing LV lead prior enrollment - Patients life expectancy le 1 year - Patients include another clinical trial affect objective study VI . Study Procedures : A. Overview Data Collection Requirements : Clinical data collect baseline , implant , regularly schedule follow-up visit 12months , system modification , patient withdrawal/exit . Data collect via case report form , Save-to-Disk file . B. Enrollment Procedures : There medication treatment require study . Patients enrol LEARN Study receive standard medical care typically provide investigator . There medication treatment permit study , unless conflict patient inclusion/exclusion criterion . Patients plan implanted CRT-ICD evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion invite participate study . Each study subject must sign IRB/MEC approve consent form prior implant . Once patient sign consent form patient enrol LEARN Study . Patients must consent enrol prior hospital discharge . At time enrollment , Baseline Case Report Form must complete . The following information document form : - Verification inclusion/exclusion criterion meet - Patient demographic information - Cardiovascular status history - Arrhythmia status history - Current Cardiovascular Medications C. Implant Procedures : The Medtronic device implant accord manufacturer 's instruction . The lead implant accord instruction provide applicable lead . Only commercially available RA , RV LV lead may use study . At implant , record model number serial number device lead implant implant form . In event patient receive ConcertoTM equivalent LVCM equip Medtronic CRT-ICD device , withdrawn study via study exit case report form . In event LV lead place time implant subsequent attempt implant LV lead either successful attempt , patient withdrawn study via study exit case report form . D. LVCM Programming Requirements : In order collect data LV threshold , LVCM feature must set either Monitor Adaptive . The setting must note implant form . E. Follow-up Procedures : The follow perform regularly schedule in-clinic follow-up visit 12 month post-implant include required 12 month visit . Record require data correspond CRF patient . 1 . Record LV lead data follow CRF . 2 . Record result manual LV threshold test b ) 'Interrogate ' perform final Save-to-Disk . F. Adverse Event Reporting : Adverse event collect study . G. System Modification : In event CRT defibrillator lead system require invasive modification ( e.g. , device LV lead explant , device LV lead replacement , attempt place LV lead initial failed attempt , lead repositioning ) , System Modification Case Report Form must complete . If patient 's CRT defibrillator system LV lead explanted replaced , complete study exit form exit patient study . H. Study Exit : In event patient unable unwilling continue participation study , notify Medtronic Clinical Research Manager immediately . Patients enrol study , receive Concerto equivalent Medtronic device , well patient receive LV lead must withdraw via Study Exit Case Report Form . If patient express desire withdraw study , Study Exit Case Report Form must complete . The reason patient withdrawal must document form . In case patient fail comply follow-up schedule , study site must attempt contact patient . Each attempt contact patient must document patient 's record . In event patient lose follow-up , Study Exit Case Report Form must complete . Details attempt contact patient method use ( e.g . telephone , register mail ) must record case report form . In event patient death , study exit form complete patient death list reason withdrawal . I . Study Deviations : A Study Deviation define event clinical Investigator site personnel conduct study accord Investigational Plan , protocol , applicable law regulation Investigator Agreement . Examples include limit : failure obtain informed consent , miss save disk etc . It responsibility investigator notify study sponsor ( Medtronic Canada Ltd. ) deviation complete Deviation CRF include rationale deviation . Any planned deviation may affect right , safety welfare patient involve study require prior approval IRB/MEC Medtronic . If patient enrol violation inclusion exclusion criterion , patient contribute study objective . All protocol deviation report investigator Medtronic deviation CRF sit IRB/MEC per IRB/MEC policy .</detailed_description>
