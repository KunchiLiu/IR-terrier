	<brief_summary>In 2008 research study conduct Dr. Barth involve 46 woman determine whole breast radiation therapy perform lumpectomy borderline malignant phyllode tumor decrease rate recurrence . None 46 participant develop local recurrence . Based information learn research study , recommend whole breast radiation therapy woman malignant borderline phyllode tumor receive lumpectomy . New method deliver breast radiotherapy develop allow radiation deliver solely site surgical resection . This call partial breast radiation . The main advantage partial breast radiation simplifies treatment patient . Radiation deliver twice day 5 day , rather 5 day per week 6 week . The main concern partial breast radiation might miss site breast cancer breast receive radiation . Evidence accumulate research study partial breast radiation therapy surgical removal common type breast cancer , invasive ductal carcinoma , breast result rate local recurrence comparable see whole breast radiation therapy . In contrast patient invasive ductal cancer breast , rare patient phyllodes tumor appear one area breast . Review research data determine cancer recurrence see patient phyllodes tumor undergone lumpectomy almost always original tumor site . Therefore , partial breast radiation likely effective whole breast radiation therapy resection malignant phyllode tumor . The purpose study determine chance phyllodes tumor recur breast breast treat partial breast radiation therapy lumpectomy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic proof phyllode tumor borderline malignant grade , first define Pietruszka modify Azzopardi adopt World Health Organization ( 1,2,17 ) : Borderline malignant : 59 mitoses/10 HPF , push infiltrating margin , 2+ ( moderate ) stromal cellularity atypia . Malignant : 10 mitoses / 10 HPF , predominantly infiltrate margin , usually 3+ ( severe ) stromal cellularity atypia occasionally 2+ . The tumor excise breastconserving resection tumor see margin resection . No prior breast carcinoma ductal carcinoma situ ipsilateral breast . Patients local recurrence previously excise phyllode tumor eligible recurrence area previous excision . No history irradiation ipsilateral breast . No evidence area worrisome cancer physical examination mammography ipsilateral breast . Age &gt; 18 year . Informed consent . Documentation either : 1. patient 's medical insurance company certify pay cost radiation therapy treatment , 2. letter patient indicate explicitly understand cost radiation therapy sponsor ( Principal Investigator ) study hold responsible cost . Histologically positive margin . Breast carcinoma ductal carcinoma situ ipsilateral breast . A history irradiation ipsilateral breast . Pregnancy . A urine pregnancy test perform fertile premenopausal female prior entry study . Patients childbearing potential must employ effective contraception radiation therapy . A radiation planning CT scan demonstrates target lumpectomy cavity clearly delineate target lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume &gt; 30 % . Unacceptable radiation therapy quality assurance parameter , define Section 5 protocol .</criteria>
