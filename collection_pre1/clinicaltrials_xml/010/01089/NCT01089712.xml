	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine best way prevent infection heart surgery . Participation study last 3 month heart surgery . The study collect information care patient receive plan surgery . No new testing procedure do . Patients receive test procedure doctor already plan . This kind study observational study , plan observe care patient receive well treatment . The information collect help improve quality surgical care future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hospital-acquired infection represent main non-cardiac complication heart surgery . They associate substantial morbidity high mortality , often require prolonged hospitalization additional surgery . The proportion cardiac surgery patient high-risk infection increase increased prevalence co-morbid condition obesity diabetes mellitus general ( especially elderly ) population . In addition increase morbidity mortality , infectious complication also result great economic burden . A past study estimate incremental cost treat Medicare beneficiary suffer septicemia coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) $ 59,204 . These patient stay hospital 21.3 day long experience serious adverse event . Of great relevance treat hospital , Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) announce fall 2007 would longer pay care relate preventable complication . CMS specifically mention exclude reimbursement mediastinitis CABG , catheter associate infection . Thus , crucial need identify variable mitigate infection post cardiac surgery develop effective preventative treatment strategy . Prior study examine relationship patient baseline ( preoperative ) characteristic ( e.g. , co-morbid condition ) hospital-acquired infection post cardiac surgery . The STS database , example , lead identification predictive factor post-operative CABG infection . Much variation outcomes see different institution , however , explain difference preoperative patient characteristic alone . How care deliver also play essential role determine infection rate therefore likely explain difference rate observe different institution . The literature sufficiently examine relationship treatment/management practice ( e.g. , line management , ventilator management , etc ) postoperative infection risk . In study seek good understand management practice put patient high risk infection post-cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
