	<brief_title>Clinical Application 18F-3'-Fluoro-3'-Deoxy-L-thymidine ( 18F-FLT ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Lung Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer become leading cause cancer death Taiwan . 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) use find effective diagnosing , stag , restaging primary non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , 18F-FDG tumor specific . It may also show increased uptake benign tumor tissue inflammatory cell , macrophage fibroblast . Therefore , ability 18F-FDG PET characterize lung nodule remain challenge , especially Taiwan tuberculosis still prevalent . Recently , 18F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine ( 18F-FLT ) , radiolabeled analog thymidine , synthesize imaging tumor cell proliferation vivo . The tracer trap within cytosol monophosphorylated thymidine kinase-1 ( TK-1 ) , principle enzyme salvage pathway DNA synthesis . It demonstrate cell culture , animal model clinical study accumulation 18F-FLT dependent presence TK-1 therefore closely associate cellular proliferation . Malignant lung lesion reveal significant 18F-FLT accumulation benign lung tumor show 18F-FLT uptake . Therefore , 18F-FLT PET may accurate 18F-FDG PET differentiate benign malignant pulmonary lesion . In addition , correlation 18F-FLT uptake cellular proliferation hint usefulness 18F-FLT PET monitoring treatment response cytostatic anticancer drug . In meantime , cyclotron hot lab facility National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) develop 18F-FLT successfully . After careful quality assurance animal experiment , ready perform clinical study human being . We thus design prospective 3-year project 1 . To evaluate usefulness 18F-FLT PET 18F-FDG PET differentiate benign malignant pulmonary nodule Taiwan tuberculosis still prevalent . 2 . To assess usefulness 18F-FLT PET early prediction therapeutic response platinum-based chemotherapy EGFR inhibitor NSCLC patient . 3 . To correlate 18F-FLT uptake EGFR mutation status , therapeutic response survival NSCLC patient .</detailed_description>
