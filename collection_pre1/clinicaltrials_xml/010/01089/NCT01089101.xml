	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Low Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) child recurrent refractory low-grade glioma . ( Phase I , complete April 29 , 2013 ) II . To describe toxicity profile define dose limit toxicity AZD6244 child recurrent refractory low-grade glioma . ( Phase I ) III . To study safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) AZD6244 determine base safety data child &gt; = 12 year age child &lt; 12 year age ; MTD/RP2D old child toxic young child , de-escalate one dose level study safety dose young age cohort . ( Phase I ) IV . To assess sustain response rate AZD6244 administer 25 mg/m^2/dose twice daily ( BID ) , single arm Phase II set patient assign stratum base neurofibromatosis ( NF ) -1 status presence absence v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B ( BRAF ) aberration , specifically BRAF V600E mutation and/or BRAF KIAA1549 fusion identify immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) , respectively . ( Phase II ) V. To estimate sustain response rate prolong disease stabilization rate ( define lack disease progression &gt; = 12 course ) associate AZD6244 patient recurrent and/or progressive low-grade glioma previously receive treatment PBTC-029 PBTC-029B minimum 12 course , least stable disease patient sustain response remain treatment &lt; 12 course . ( Re-treatment Study ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize inter- intra-patient variability AZD6244 pharmacokinetics administer schedule ass influence patient specific covariates ( include concomitant drug therapy ) AZD6244 pharmacokinetics . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate feasibility collect pre-trial tumor sample feasibility use situ hybridization assay identify BRAF aberration available tumor specimen . ( Phase I ) III . To determine pre-trial tumor sample show biochemical signature indicate activation mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . ( Phase I ) IV . To describe magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) characteristic tumor treatment explore diffusion change tumor treatment determine early diffusion indicator response . ( Phase I ) V. Within constraint Phase I trial , document antitumor activity treatment AZD6244 , measure objective response progression-free survival ( PFS ) . ( Phase I ) VI . To explore pharmacogenetic polymorphism AZD6244 metabolize enzyme transporter relate polymorphism AZD6244 pharmacokinetics . ( Phase I ) VII . To estimate PFS distribution associate AZD6244 treatment separately patient assign six stratum well various subset e.g . histology tumor grade across stratum . ( Phase II ) VIII . To explore correlation BRAF aberration treatment response PFS patient relevant biology data available . ( Phase II ) IX . To assess MAPK aberration combination whole-exome ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sequencing . ( Phase II ) X . To characterize inter- intra-patient variability AZD6244 pharmacokinetics administer schedule MTD/RP2D . ( Phase II ) XI . To determine progression-free survival follow re-treatment AZD6244 progressive , recurrent low-grade glioma evaluate impact variable previous response , interval treatment regimen , BRAF status previous dose AZD6244 . ( Re-treatment Study ) XII . To evaluate toxicity profile re-treatment AZD6244 correlate toxicity see initial treatment . ( Re-treatment Study ) XIII . To evaluate toxicity profile re-treatment AZD6244 beyond 2 year patient continue show benefit drug , i.e . least stable disease ( SD ) . ( Re-treatment Study ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study ( complete April 29 , 2013 ) follow phase II study . Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience sustain objective response selumetinib phase I phase II portion trial , complete 2 year treatment stop study drug may enrol re-treatment study progression/recurrence . Patients re-treatment study may continue treatment indefinitely absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
