	<detailed_description>In United States , patient dependent upon parenteral nutrition ( PN ) receive parenteral fat emulsion compose soybean oil . Lipids necessary PN dependent patient due high caloric value essential fatty acid content . They implicate predispose patient PN associate liver disease . Phytosterols contain soybean oil think deleterious effect biliary secretion . Children require prolong PN risk develop PN associate liver disease . We hypothesize although omega-6 fatty acid emulsion prevent fatty acid deficiency , clear manner similar enteral chylomicron therefore accumulate liver result steatotic liver injury . We hypothesize fat emulsion comprise omega-3 fatty acid ( i.e. , fish oil ) Omegaven™ would beneficial management steatotic liver injury inhibition de novo lipogenesis , reduction arachidonic acid-derived inflammatory mediator , prevention essential fatty acid deficiency presence small amount arachidonic acid , improve clearance lipid serum . Animal study show IV fat emulsion ( IFE ) fish oil high eicosapentaenic docashexaaenoic acid reduce impairment bile flow see cholestasis cause conventional fat emulsion . Intravenous omega three fatty acid may well tolerate might reduce inflammatory effect liver prolong PN exposure could potentially reverse hepatic dysfunction due PN/IFE use . By administer Omegaven™ place conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsion may reverse prevent progression PN associate cholestasis thus allow patient maintain adequate PN able ingest adequate nutrition enterally .</detailed_description>
