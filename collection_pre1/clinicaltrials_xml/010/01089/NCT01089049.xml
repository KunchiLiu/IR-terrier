	<brief_title>Effect Natural Health Product Urinary Estrogen Metabolites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The active botanical constituent femMED Breast Health Formula contain lignans , compound anti-estrogenic activity , show exert estrogenic effect follicular phase [ i.e . estrogen low ] antiestrogenic effect luteal phase female menstrual cycle . These plant-derived chemical act weak mimic estrogen body . Overall compound find helpful stabilize natural cyclical fluctuation estrogen level . The trial double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel study 100 subject recruit one two arm study : one arm consist pre-menopausal woman ; another consist post-menopausal woman . Each arm study carry concurrently one phase , washout period . The placebo assignment randomize within arm study . Subjects arm study follow protocol . Urine blood sample collect group first last visit , subject receive month 's supply treatment placebo first visit , consume daily basis second lab visit 28 day later . Urine sample analyze follow estrogen metabolite : 2-OH-estrone 16-Î± OH-estrone . Blood sample would collect assessed level enterolactone . Pre post-supplementation result assess difference statistical comparison .</detailed_description>
