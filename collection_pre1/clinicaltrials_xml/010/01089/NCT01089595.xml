	<brief_summary>Patients advance GIST treat imatinib . This study seek look new therapeutic agent time tumor progression follow treatment 600-800 mg daily imatinib . The study look see Nilotinib ( tasigna ) alone combination imatinib ( gleevec ) effective control disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Tasigna ( Nilotinib ) 400 mg Twice Daily Alone With Gleevec ( Imatinib Mesylate ) 400 mg Daily Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resistance imatinib develop represent major clinical challenge . Mechanisms implicate imatinib resistance include : target resistance due new KIT PDGFRA mutation expression KIT protein ; target modulation due activation alternate receptor tyrosine kinase protein loss KIT oncoprotein expression ; functional resistance due KIT PDGFRA activation without secondary mutation ; alteration imatinib uptake P-glycoprotein . This study seek test nilotinib alone nilotinib combination imatinib patient progress imatinib . Nilotinib new synthetic second-generation inhibitor BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase compete ATP-bindings site BCR-ABL . A complete phase I trial assess activity nilotinib alone combination imatinib patient progress imatinib population patient imatinib refractory intolerant patient . There rare response , stable disease observe grater 50 % patient . This study aim treat patient advance metastatic GIST disease progression imatinib dose escalate 600 mg great . The rationale explore Nilotinib set determine therapeutic efficacy , potentially less toxicity current standard care second line therapy . In addition , since uncommon see progression metastatic GIST lesion imatinib , others remain controlled , add nilotinib may treat progress lesion imatinib continue control area without disease progression .</detailed_description>
