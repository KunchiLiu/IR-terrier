	<brief_summary>Foot ulceration risk factor associate early death patient chronic kidney disease . Little known relationship risk factor develop patient kidney failure onset low limb threaten foot ulcer . Diabetes major cause kidney disease foot ulceration ; however previous study report significant proportion kidney failure patient haemodialysis treatment without diagnosis diabetes also risk factor could lead foot ulceration . The aim study identify risk factor associate low limb threaten disease patient advance kidney failure . In addition robust screen tool develop address reliability validity current screen method deem gold standard assessment diabetic foot disease Chronic Kidney Disease population . It important follow progression risk factor kidney failure worsens . The study also intend screen patient start dialysis treatment follow progress respect risk factor know predispose foot ulceration first year treatment . The propose outcome study develop strategy identify patient kidney failure risk foot ulceration intervene early point prevent life threaten complication associated foot disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors Foot Ulceration Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk factor contribute foot ulceration diabetic population well publish , abundance publication demonstrate acceleration risk factor association diabetic nephropathy . It also apparent risk factor present non-diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease population much less information prevalence progression publish . A recent pilot study report significant risk factor foot ulceration population subject receive haemodialysis therapy absence diabetes mellitus . The study aim increase understand Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) development foot ulceration diabetic non-diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease population renal failure progress dialysis initiate . Design methodology : Patient Identification : It propose identify patient Chronic Kidney Disease level 4 ( renal function 15 30 % normal ) Nephrology clinic University Hospital Wales , Cardiff . It group patient risk progression renal disease towards end stage subsequent need dialysis . A proportion patient identify pre-dialysis clinic due commence dialysis imminently . It group patient use examine specific effect dialysis modality risk factor foot ulceration The directorate Nephrology Transplantation Cardiff 450 haemodialysis patient , 140 peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) patient , around 400 Chronic Kidney Disease level 4 patient . Approximately 100 new patient commence dialysis year 35 start peritoneal dialysis rest haemodialysis . Renal patient currently freedom choose preferred modality dialysis follow series inform consultation Physician . One method may indicate another patient meet suitability criteria one modality . However , current recruitment trend demonstrate patient prefer choose haemodialysis despite socioeconomic challenge therapy pose quality life cost constraint health service . A previous study demonstrate 20 % patient diabetes develop foot ulceration within first year commence haemodialysis may attribute hypoxia peripheral tissue haemodialysis process . There much less information change see initiation peritoneal dialysis study may help influence dialysis modality choice future one method dialysis associate development few low limb threaten complication . Inclusion criterion : Stage 4/5 Chronic Kidney Disease ( eGFR &lt; 30ml/min ) Over 18 year age Exclusion criterion : Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 1-3 ( eGFR &gt; 31 ) Inability refusal give informed consent Life expectancy &lt; 6 month The Proton database hold within Nephrology along clinic list use identify potential patient research team invitation letter send study information leaflet prior clinic visit . The Physician clinic recruit patient take part study Outpatient consultation . Clinic list also review identify patient Chronic Kidney Disease stage 4/5 . Screening protocol : The longitudinal prospective study propose would expand pilot study result include level 4 Chronic Kidney Disease monitor development low limb threaten risk factor progression kidney failure towards end stage renal disease.Patients follow 2 year period . A single Podiatrist undertake interview use non-invasive technique assess foot physiological risk factor accordance evidence-based practice . The Renal Foot Screening Tool develop use prospectively identify neurovascular risk factor foot ulceration . Patients would podiatry assessment baseline , 12 24 month . In addition trigger assessment would take place commencement dialysis . Power calculation difficult undertake give lack current knowledge risk factor group patient . Following consultation statistician supervisory team minimum figure 100 adopt target Chronic Kidney Disease level 4 patient additional minimum 100 patient commence renal replacement therapy course study period.The target recruitment estimate take account financial resource implication , agree supervisory team realistic sample size . Subsequent statistical analysis include multiple regression . Interview : Demographic medical information obtain patient interview medical record time foot screen . Patients question prior foot care education , patient perception current foot health status , history Podiatry care , history foot ulceration previous amputation . Non-invasive assessment techniques No current foot screen provision patient Chronic Kidney Disease exist Cardiff . The research participant detailed foot screen consultation identify potential risk foot ulceration allow early intervention require . The patient enrol study enhance care term identification potential foot ulceration . However , raise ethical concern . The first patient may see presentation foot ulcer high risk develop foot ulcer patient refer Podiatry service routine treatment . The issue patient give verbal education regard specific foot care need contact . We justify try find factor associate Chronic Kidney Disease contribute foot ulceration longitudinal fashion . Intervention education could confound true prevalence study . We would acknowledge simply check foot patient would alter awareness also may influence study finding small way . Information leaflet provide high risk participant give indication danger sign precede ulceration infection , help line telephone number call participant develop warn sign . The participant fast track refer Cardiff &amp; Vale Podiatry department , give urgent appointment Cardiff &amp; Vale Podiatry Wound Clinic treatment plan . Follow care provide local Community Podiatry Service wound heal . Non-healing foot ulcer refer Multi-disciplinary Foot Ulcer Clinic review Vascular , Orthopaedic , Medical team . Peripheral neuropathy : To ensure patient neuropathy identified multiple form assessment use patient . All method assessment standardise , test demonstrate back one hand patient experience prior formal neuropathy test . The previously publish Neuropathy Symptom Score use pick symptomatic peripheral neuropathy . This scoring system use identify sensory symptom peripheral neuropathy , ache , burning , prickle , numbness , sharp pain . Light pressure sensation test use Semmes-Weinstein 10g monofilament 10 site foot . The patient instruct close eye , 10g monofilament apply 90 degree right angle select site buckle , hold 1 second move onto next test site . A positive neuropathy score monofilament assessment define inability perceive monofilament sensation test site foot . A neurothesiometer use test vibration perception threshold . This device apply tractor balance vertically onto pulp hallux voltage increase base unit patient perceive vibration sensation . A mean three reading would record foot.A value 25 volt would confirm patient 'At Risk ' foot ulceration . Given patient often score differently test , patient positive score 3 repetition classify peripheral neuropathy . Vascular Insufficiency : The Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire use diagnose symptomatic vascular insufficiency . Patients score positive symptomatic vascular insufficiency describe either symptoms intermittent claudication rest pain . The possibility concomitant peripheral neuropathy patient population symptom alone insufficient diagnose peripheral vascular disease . Therefore hand hold Doppler ultrasound use locate dorsalis pedis posterior tibial artery . The probe lightly apply skin avoid occlusion artery , audible sound reproduce printout preparation waveform analysis . Arterial insufficiency record dorsalis pedis posterior tibial signal monophasic single low limb . Foot Pathology : It recognise foot pathology additional risk factor foot ulceration especially patient either peripheral neuropathy vascular insufficiency . Both foot visually inspected common pathology predispose diabetic foot ulceration . Any deformity , include hammer toe Charcot deformity , nail dystrophy , corn callus report additional risk factor . The presence active foot ulceration document grade accord Texas Wound Classification system ascertain severity wound present within cohort . Data collect laptop study identification number record ensure anonymisation participant data collection data analysis research team statistician . The laptop password secure store lock filling cabinet lock office key access Band 7 Podiatrist . Files contain consent form index numerical order study identification number , store lock filling cabinet access Principle Investigator Band 7 Podiatrist . The file source person identifiable information . Body Composition Monitoring : The use none invasive assessment body composition allow review body fluid status may impact ability tissue heal . Resources : A Podiatrist require undertake longitudinal study part time basis . This support fact highly specialise skill develop Podiatrist need maintain PhD study period also require contribution specialist clinical duty . The equipment need make measurement available department Podiatry calibrate used day day basis current patient care . Willing participant offer foot screen end Nephrology OPD consultation minimise inconvenience travel parking cost A contribution may require patient travel expense recall . The full support Institute Nephrology obtain term supervision Consultant Nephrologist access patient information . Dissemination : It propose work present Podiatry Renal conference UK overseas . Minimum 3 paper 3 conference presentation . There room publication Podiatry Renal publication ensure group professional inform . Posters prepare international conference . There also opportunity consider Nursing conference raise general awareness issue , opportunity arise preparation review article take . Outcomes impact : The primary outcome study identify neurovascular risk factor foot ulceration renal function decline , develop suitable foot protection programme Chronic Kidney Disease patient . The secondary outcome measure identify whether dialysis modality choice influence foot ulcer development use inform patient choice dialysis .</detailed_description>
