	<detailed_description>Combination chemotherapy acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) usually include bacterial L-asparaginase enzyme derive Escherichia coli Erwinia specie . Several study describe pharmacokinetics child 1 year age asparaginase give intramuscularly well intravenously . The development anti-asparaginase antibody foreign protein also describe . Chemotherapy infant ALL also include L-asparaginase . However , pharmacokinetics asparaginase antibody formation infant need described optimize therapy group patient doubtful prognosis . Background In general information drug metabolism neonates infant scarce well reaction immature immune system foreign protein . Several pharmacokinetic study perform child one year age , data available pharmacokinetics antibody formation treatment asparaginase preparation infant . Pharmacokinetics : Asparaginase use treatment childhood ALL since depletes blood asparagine , synthesize normal cell leukemic lymphoblast . It show serum activity 100 IU/l ensure depletion asparagine serum CNS . In many case even value considerably low 100 IU/l deplete asparagine serum1-5 . In Interfant-06 protocol dose asparaginase adopt childhood ALL-protocols without scientific foundation . Infants may metabolise asparaginase differently thus may achieve amino acid depletion . Antibody formation : Asparaginase foreign protein human body , patient may develop antibody , result allergic reaction ( probably mediate IgE-antibodies ) silent antibody ( IgG antibody , block effect enzyme ) . In first case treatment often stop second case treatment insufficient6-7 , thus give patient poor prognosis case . In Interfant-06 patient treat native E.coli asparaginase period follow PEG-asparaginase later treatment . Studies older child show approximately 1/3 patient develop IgG-antibodies native E.coli 5-6 doses7 . Other study show IgG-antibodies native E.coli asparaginase cross-react PEG-asparaginase , result faster clearance enzyme8 . Allergic reaction ( grade ) native E.coli asparaginase encounter approximately 30 % children11-12 . There knowledge frequency antibody formation asparaginase therapy infant . Aim The study purpose : - describe pharmacokinetics intramuscular native E.coli PEG-asparaginase child 1 year diagnosis - evaluate antibody formation asparaginase treatment E.coli follow PEG-asparaginase infant</detailed_description>
