	<brief_summary>This study design prospective clinical trial aim investigate mechanism behind observed improvement type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) follow bariatric surgery . The majority patient T2DM undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) surgery , particular , experience complete remission T2DM almost immediately post-surgery . This response occur significant weight loss possible . To assess mechanism involve disease resolution , investigator propose study evaluate patient UW Medical Center ( UWMC ) T2DM undergo RYGB G ( gastronomy ) -tube placement part clinical care . The investigator interested sub-population G-tube allow u unique opportunity evaluate glycemic control insulin response follow delivery exclusion nutrient otherwise bypass portion gastrointestinal tract . The investigator hypothesize nutrient delivery proximal GI tract reverse RYGB-mediated improvement glucose homeostasis , possibly association change nutrient-regulated gut peptide involve glucose control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery cause complete , durable remission type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) 84 % case , typically within day week surgery . Mounting evidence indicate dramatic phenomenon result effect beyond related weight loss reduce caloric intake alone . The mechanisms mediate weight-independent anti-diabetes impact RYGB unknown , elucidate could lead new diabetes medicine . Human subject undergo frequently sample I.V . glucose tolerance test ( FS-IVGTT ) tracer-enhanced hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp ( measure insulin secretion sensitivity ) RYBG 3 time first six week afterward , proximal small bowel either exclude nutrient contact expose nutrient deliver indwell gastric cannula . We hypothesize nutrient delivery proximal GI tract reverse RYGB-mediated improvement glucose homeostasis , possibly association change nutrient-regulated gut peptide involve glucose control . Our study allow u test upper intestinal hypothesis rigorously man , whether hypothesis confirm refute , gain valuable new insight mechanisms improve glucose control early RYGB .</detailed_description>
