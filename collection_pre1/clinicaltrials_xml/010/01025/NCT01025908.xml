	<detailed_description>The patient PDA diagnose medical psychiatrist team Respiration Panic Laboratory Instituto de Psiquiatria da Universidade Federal Rio de Janeiro ( IPUB/UFRJ ) , INCT Translational Medicine , accord criterion diagnostic Manual Diagnostic Statistics Mental Disorder ( DSM-IV-TR , 2002b ) accord evaluation instrument SCID-I ( Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic ) ( First et al , 1997 ) . The sample consist 50 voluntary patient divide two Groups . The 1st Group , make 25 individual , receive 10 session CBT . The 2nd Group , `` control '' , also consist 25 patient , receive supportive psychotherapy . With view compare result Groups intervention , follow evaluation instrument apply begin end research : Beck Anxiety Inventory ( Beck et al , 1998a ) ; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( Spielberg et al , 1970 ) ; Sheehan Disability Scale ( Sheeham , 1983a ) ; Global Assessment Functioning ( AXIS V ) ( DSM-IV-TR , 2002c ) ; questionnaire fear phobias ( Mark &amp; Mathews , 1979 ) ; questionnaire cognitive agoraphobia ( Chambless , 1984a ) ; questionnaire body sensation ( Chambless , 1984b ) Panic Agoraphobia Scale ( Bandelow , 1999a ) . The criteria inclusion research patient 18 year old sexes diagnosis PDA , serious comorbidities . The patient present alcohol drug dependency , mental retardation serious mental disorder exclude research . The patient agree participate study , sign `` Term Free Clarified Consent '' make aware procedure undertaken , approve Committee Ethics research IPUB/UFRJ . In evaluation test Chi-square test ( χ2 ) ANOVA , depend type variable measure , always 95 % Confidence , P-Value ≤ 0,05 . In characterization Groups , test undertaken value identify begin treatment . Thus , efficiency initiative undertaken could perceive . The objective identify significant statistical difference , initial final result test . The 10 CBT session base previous study ( King et al , 2007a ) , modification adaptation appropriate characteristic sample patient study . The content session distribute follow way : PD education ( include educational concept anxiety , agoraphobia , panic , hyperventilation , respiratory re-education exercise ( RR exercise ) , progressive muscular relaxation exercise ( PMR exercise ) , preparation scale `` patient fear '' small great cause anxiety , identification cognitive distortion , cognitive restructuring ( CR ) , symptom induction exercise ( SIE ) , IE , IVE , reinforcement conquest , observation difficulty procedures maintenance treatment gain . The patient encourage apply cognitive strategy home , expose change temperature , physical exercise , amongst others , several time , purpose induce tolerate sensation therapeutic assistance . The learning first phase treatment BS relate panic really dangerous essential overcome agoraphobia control panic . Standard model 10 CBT session : 1. st . Session : Education concern trajectory PD preparation priority list fear situation patient . Instructions patient relaxation technique , repeat whenever necessary . RR exercise : Placing one hand one stomach , feel air pass diaphragm , perception abdominal movement respiration . Slow inspiration nose count three , hold respiration , count three , release air slowly mouth count six . Repetition exercise several time row . In continuity , Progressive Muscular Relaxation ( PMR ) ( Jacobson , 1938 ) undertake individual , whereby instructor seek exercise tensioning four Groups muscle ten second immediately relax another ten second . The latter : 1st face ; 2nd arm , shoulder , chest neck ; 3rd abdomen , spine , genital organ 4th legs foot . 2. nd . Session : explanation concern physiological mechanism `` fight flight '' ( Barlow , 1988b ) , verification similarity sensation originate mechanism , compare BS emerge panic . Undertake RR exercise , use constantly session . When one manage alter thought refer capacity deal fear situation , one capable control physical symptom . 3. rd . Session : model hyperventilation delineate rhythm depth exaggerated respiration need body specific give moment . The latter undertaken patient sit position SIE hyperventilation : patient inspires expire deeply 90 second , observation patient reaction explanation reason emerge symptom . Undertaking RR exercise . The patient understand anticipate anxiety characterize anticipated thought process , generally negative , feared situation . Even secure situation mind interpret insecure , body react message danger produce symptom . 4. th . Session : SIE : -sitting , look fixedly light minute afterwards stand quickly try read something . Analysis patient sensation present level negative , catastrophic repetitive thought occur . The patient begin understand origin symptom perceive inoffensive , learning deal . In continuity , RR exercise administer . 5. th . Session : explanation concept BS accentuate due situation substance . Examples : exercise oneself move oneself quickly , brusque change temperature , bright light , use caffeine , alcohol , medicine irregular level respiration . Panic root fear physical sensation ( Rangé , 2001b ) . A patient submit SIE : turn around circle minute , afterwards stop , understand give new positive significance reaction verify . Immediately , RR exercise administer . 6. th . Session : PA patient complaint : ex : `` I breathe '' , `` I go suffocate '' . It explain natural breathe excessively one anxious . The body seek energy form oxygen prepare deal danger . When oxygen use proportion consume , result hyperventilation . The concept hyperventilation remember SIE 4th session repeat , follow RR exercise . 7. th . Session : education concern CR - The way event interpret determines nature result emotional reaction ( Rangé , 2001c ) . The patient try identify give new significance specific badly-adapted cognation . The concept Anticipated Anxiety ( AA ) agoraphobic avoidance ( PA-aa ) ( Beck , 1994 ) clarify . Patients custom myth relation PA : `` I think I go lose control '' , `` I think I go die '' , `` I think I go heart attack '' , I think I go mad '' , amongst others . The patient instruct question contest conjecture belief concentrate realistic probability gather evidence form deal event . 8. th.Session : The IE refers fear learnt internal state . Certain sensation terror , similar fear previously experience , custom indicate new possible PA ( Muotri et al , 2007c ) . The automatic stimulus generate intensifies fear sensation , create vicious circle . Undertake two SIE : Sitting , place patient 's head legs 30 second , afterwards sit quickly look ceiling . And exercise : patient hold respiration longer hold turn round circle 30 second . In continuity , analysis symptom try understand originate cause . RR exercise undertaken . 9. th . Session : Undertake three SIE : repeat exercise 5th session two 8th session subsequent administration RR exercise . The purpose individual associate symptom cause , explain symptom emerge physiological alteration trigger reason , differently one thought BS emerge nowhere , apparent reason . Previously , patient would make distorted association fact , interpret tachycardia , perspiration , lack breath , among others , sign imminent death loss control result specific trigger factor . 10. th . Session : one SIE : patient stand turn head one side 30 second , stops try fix eye spot wall . Repeat exercise SIE 3rd session , continuity ; recover patient 's physical balance respiration RR PMR exercise . Evaluate IVE concept regard confront patient agoraphobic situation location . Explain agoraphobia maintain fear panic experience certain BS . Real confrontation fear situation repeat item priority list patient 's fear , begin least anxiety provocative , reach fear . Ask patient practise IVE whenever opportunity . Review IVEs undertaken , encourage practical repetition , discus difficulty procedure . The behaviour exceed oneself encourage instead unnecessary precaution . Remind patient run away IVE reinforces maintenance fear . The therapist stimulate thought concern avoided task help patient CR . The fact additional diagnostics tendency decline PD treatment comment . Ex : comorbidities depression , generalize anxiety social phobia . Reaffirm fear response inoffensive , pass controllable , BS appear disappear , without need avoid . After end stage research , two Groups re-evaluated initial instrument . The Groups compare , observe change occur , benefit , loss difference occur Group 1 receive accompaniment CBT medication , compare Group 2 control make use medication CBT .</detailed_description>
