	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy together gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect stereotactic body radiation therapy give without gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Without Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To demonstrate feasibility safety administer margin-intensive stereotactic body radiotherapy together preoperative gemcitabine hydrochloride patient resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study gemcitabine hydrochloride . Patients receive 1 2 treatment regimen . - Regimen 1 : Patients undergo single fraction margin-intensive stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) day 1 . Patients undergo pancreatoduodenectomy day 15-43 . - Regimen 2 : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients undergo single fraction SBRT day 21-28 followed pancreatoduodenectomy day 35-63 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
