The primary criterion inclusion constant pain least three month duration least moderate level average pain ( i.e. , score 4 great 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad pain imaginable ) numerical rating scale average pain . All patient must access touch-tone telephone . Excluded patient life threaten acute physical illness , current alcohol substance abuse dependence , current psychosis , suicidal ideation , dementia , individual seek surgical pain treatment .
