	<brief_summary>If subject list kidney transplant consider sensitize , mean high amount antibody blood could react kidney transplant offer . Antibodies protein substance make body fight anything body considers threat , infection kidney transplant . Sensitization may due prior transplant , pregnancy , blood transfusion . Being sensitized increase subject 's kidney transplant wait time difficult find suitable kidney transplant antibody react . The purpose research study see give investigational drug belimumab one year pre-transplant de-sensitize subject , decrease amount antibody blood . This may help make subject eligible receive kidney transplant quickly . If receive belimumab , subject compatible donor kidney offer medically suitable transplant time , kidney transplant perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Desensitization With Belimumab Sensitized Patients Awaiting Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one third patient await kidney transplant transplant center significant level antibody blood lead longer wait time kidney transplant death . Antibodies blood may due prior transplant , pregnancy , blood transfusion . These antibody sensitize patient make difficult patient get compatible kidney transplant . The measure antibodies call panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) range 0-100 % , 100 % sensitize . The wait time patient PRA range 20 % -79 % 5 year compare patient low PRA ( 0 % -19 % ) 3-4 year . Patients PRA great 80 % likely grant extra point increase chance transplantation . Antibodies patient may due prior transplant , pregnancy , blood transfusion . To date , trial belimumab perform patient pre-existing antibody await kidney transplantation . This study undertaken ass effectiveness safety use belimumab normalize antibody level sensitize patient await kidney transplantation . It hop decrease antibody decrease wait time kidney transplant list , allow patient become compatible donor kidney transplant .</detailed_description>
