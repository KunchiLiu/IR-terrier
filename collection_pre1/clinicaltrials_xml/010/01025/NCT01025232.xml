	<brief_title>A Study Intravitreal Injections 2.0mg Ranibizumab Subjects With Chronic Fluid On OCT Post Multiple Injections With Ranibizumab ( Super-dose Anti-VEgf SAVE Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , Phase I/II study intravitreally administer 2.0 mg ranibizumab subject persistent fluid recurrent fluid OCT receive least nine ranibizumab injection past twelve month . Consented , enrol subject receive monthly ETDRS BCVA , ophthalmic examination OCTs evaluation use Stratus , Cirrus Spectralis machine . Fluorescein angiography autofluorescence do BSL , Months 6 12 . DNA sample genetic analysis collect baseline . Subjects receive open-label intravitreal injection 2.0 mg ranibizumab administer every 28 day 3 month : Following three load dos , patient receive minimum `` cap '' PRN treatment ( patient receive 2.0 mg intravitreal ranibizumab quarterly ) . Dosing occur earlier 22 day previous treatment . Study visit schedule occur every 30 ( ±7 ) day relative date first injection ( Day 0 ) . Subjects randomize two re-treatment cohort additional re-treatment , need : - Cohort A - Subjects receive re-treatment every 4 week persistent recurrent intraretinal , subretinal , sub-RPE fluid OCT modality , evidence hemorrhage clinical evaluation . - Cohort B - Subjects receive re-treatment every 6 week persistent recurrent intraretinal , subretinal , sub-RPE fluid OCT modality , evidence hemorrhage clinical evaluation . Every 6 week regimen test potential long duration action 2.0 mg ranibizumab .</detailed_description>
