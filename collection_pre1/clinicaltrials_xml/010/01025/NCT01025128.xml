	<brief_summary>Because high sun exposure , Israel traditionally suppose protected vitamin D deficiency , country food product hardly contain vitamin D supplement . However Jerusalem ultra-Orthodox population , constitute significant fraction city population , risk develop vitamin D deficiency due low sun exposure , consequence dress code cover body limited time outside activity . The investigator aim check whether vitamin D deficiency find frequently ultra-Orthodox male population comparison non-ultra-Orthodox male population , study eventual consequence . Correlation vitamin D level PTH level examine , accord age creatinine level . Bone mineral density ( BMD ) evaluate 2 select subgroup subject ( low high vitamin D level ) , re-evaluated 6 month vitamin D supplementation vitamin D-deficient subject . An increase BMD within 6 month would suggest osteomalacia main cause low BMD subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects : The study include 200 male age 18-70 , living Jerusalem area . Enrollment distribute among 8 clinic Clalit Health Services : 4 clinic locate predominantly ultra-Orthodox area ( group A ) 4 clinic locate mixed area ( Group B ) . Each group clinic enroll 100 subject sub-defined : Age 18-24 : 30 patient ( Groups A1 B1 ) Age 25-39 : 30 patient ( Groups A2 B2 ) Age 40-54 : 20 patient ( Groups A3 B3 ) Age 55-70 : 20 patient ( Groups A4 B4 ) Study protocol : Enrollment perform physician participate study nurse work correspond clinic , advertisement study clinic . Visit 1 : 1 . The subject receive information study aim protocol sign informed consent form . 2 . Blood pressure , height weight measure BMI calculate . 3 . The subject fill questionnaire concern personal habit : dressing code , degree sun exposure , physical activity , smoking , alcohol consumption , muscular pain general fatigue . 4 . The physician ( co-investigator ) signing informed consent form rule subject present pre-defined exclusion criterion . 5 . Blood sample draw : calcium , phosphorus , PTH , 25 OH Vitamin D , 1,25 OH Vitamin D , magnesium , creatinine , alkaline phosphatase , albumin . 6 . A urine sample collect magnesium calcium/creatinine ratio . The subject receive lab result mail , recommendation consult family physician order receive treatment case vitamin D deficiency . ( Vitamin D level &lt; 20 ng/ml ) The subject 18-39 age group ( Groups A1 , A2 , B1 B2 ) classify accord vitamin D level . The 20 subject present high vitamin D level vitamin D level &gt; 30 ng/ml constitute `` high D '' group 40 subject low vitamin D level constitute `` low D '' group . ( We expect vitamin D level 30 ng/ml `` high D '' group 10 ng/ml `` low D '' group , accord result pilot study ) . Subjects vitamin D level &gt; 30 ng/ml &lt; 10 ng/ml enrol 60 patient `` high D '' `` low D `` group proceed visit 2 3 . Visit 2 : 60 subject ( 20 `` high D '' group 40 `` low D '' group ) undergo bone mineral density examination Osteoporosis Center Mount-Scopus Hadassah Hospital . All subject low vitamin D level receive 6-month vitamin D supplementation 2000 unit per day first 12 week 1000 unit per day next 12 week . Visit 3 : The 60 subject underwent visit 2 undergo visit 3 six month later . 1 . The subject fill questionnaire similar first one detail degree compliance vitamin D supplementation 2 . Blood sample draw plasma level : calcium , phosphorus , magnesium , PTH , 25 OH vitamin D , 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D , creatinine , alkaline phosphatase , albumin 3 . A urine sample collect magnesium calcium/creatinine ratio . 4 . A repeat bone mineral density examination perform Osteoporosis Center Mount-Scopus Hadassah Hospital The subject receive test result mail recommendation consult family physician case persistent abnormal result .</detailed_description>
