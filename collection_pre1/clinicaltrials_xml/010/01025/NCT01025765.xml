The objective clinical trial evaluate effect oral hypoglycemic agent ( daily 4 week run-in period 8 week combination treatment ) CHC genotype 1 infect Taiwanese patient receive 48 week Peg-IFN plus ribavirin ( RBA ) , enrolled subject randomize 4 treatment group ( include Acarbose , Metformin , Pioglitazone standard care control group ) . During trial 24 week end treatment , serial serum HCV RNA , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level , clinical data evaluate determine therapeutic response adverse event CHC patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pegylated interferon combination ribavirin current standard treatment chronic hepatitis C virus infection , expensive several adverse effect . To modify standard treatment optimize therapeutic effect decrease adverse event important . Recent study identify close link metabolic profile , insulin resistance HCV infection . Chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) patient higher pretreatment HOMA-IR ( insulin resistance ) index poor therapeutic response one low HOMA-IR index . Thus , reasonable increase therapeutic response CHC patient lower insulin resistance . Several pilot study western world conduct evaluate concept add oral hypoglycemic agent pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment , find beneficial effect oral hypoglycemic agent CHC genotype 1 infected patient . Whether concept still hold true Taiwanese people remain unknown . To evaluate effect oral hypoglycemic agent CHC genotype 1 infected Taiwanese patient , design study evaluate virologic , biochemical histological response CHC patient receive pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment , hope identify similar beneficial effect oral hypoglycemic agent CHC Taiwanese patient . We plan enroll 80 chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infected patient clinic study . All patient inform consent , receive interferon-based therapy anti-viral medication , abstinence alcohol beverage 6 month conform regulation Bureau National Health Insurance , Taiwan . All patient randomly assign 4 different treatment arm . The patient assign first 3 arm receive one kind follow oral hypoglycemic agent , Acarbose , Metformin , Pioglitazone 12 week ( include 4 week run-in period 8 week combination treatment pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin ) . From week 13 , patient first 3 arm receive pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin 40 week . The last arm control group ; patient last arm receive standard pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin treatment 48 week . During trial 24 week end treatment , serum HCV RNA level , clinical biochemical data evaluate determine therapeutic response adverse event patient .</detailed_description>
