	<brief_summary>Subjects eventually undergo treatment HCV , gather treatment data ( start stop date ) , repeat CB-CAP analysis week 4 , 12 , 24 72 ( +/- 2 week window allow time point ) determine whether CB-CAPs level predict virologic response treat subject . Routine laboratory data also collect time point .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit consecutive HCV infect subject Center Liver Diseases ( CLD ) University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) schedule undergo liver biopsy part routine clinical care . The liver biopsy read concurrently single study pathologist blind subject ' clinical status . At time liver biopsy , blood drawn perform CB-CAP assay . The CB-CAP level correlate liver biopsy result ass ability predict degree liver injury . The investigator retrieve lab do routine clinical care close time liver biopsy , include complete blood count , serum aminotransferase level , biochemical profile . A total 250 subject recruit study . Data gather would include demographic clinical information , risk factor HCV , information drug alcohol use anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , abdominal circumference , etc. ) . For subset subject initiate treatment HCV healthcare provider , gather treatment information ( start date , stop date , treatment regimen dosage , etc . ) blood draw treatment week 4 , 12 , 24 72 ( +/- 2 week window allow time point ) determine whether CB-CAPs level predict virologic response treat subject . Routine laboratory data also collect time point . The +/- 2 week time window allow blood draw do routine clinical visit .</detailed_description>
