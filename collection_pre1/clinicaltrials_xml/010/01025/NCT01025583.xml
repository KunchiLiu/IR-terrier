	<brief_title>Oral Rehydration Solution With Zinc Prebiotics Acute Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Funding Prospective , randomize control trial collaboration family pediatrician , care child 14 year age Italian Public Health System . The study protocol illustrate discuss 3 meeting . The research fund pharmaceutical company author declare conflict interest . The study protocol review approved Ethics Committee University Federico II Naples . Participants Children 3-36 month old see pediatrician office November 2007 March 2008 present acute diarrhea last less 48 h consider eligible study . Exclusion criterion : diarrhea last 48 h , malnutrition judge body weight/height ratio 5th percentile , clinical sign severe dehydration , clinical sign coexist severe acute systemic illness ( meningitis , sepsis , pneumonia ) , immunodeficiency , underlie severe chronic disease , malnutrition , cystic fibrosis , food allergy chronic gastrointestinal disease , use pre/probiotics previous 3 week , use antibiotic antidiarrheal medication previous 3 week . Acute diarrhea define decrease consistency stool ( loose liquid ) and/or increase frequency evacuation ( 3 &gt; 3 24 h ) , without fever vomiting . Informed consent obtain parent enrolled child . Microbiologic laboratory investigation perform require specific clinical reason . Intervention Enrolled patient randomly allocate standard hypotonic ORS ( group 1 ) super-hypotonic ORS contain zinc prebiotics ( group 2 ) . We use two commercial ORS ORS preparation available market sachet similar cost packaging . The composition two ORSs report Table 1 . Randomization Blinding Patients allocate group accord computer-generated randomization list . The researcher responsible enrol patient allocate next available number upon entry trial . The parent instruct rehydrate orally child 30-50 ml/kg ORS 3-4 h mild dehydration 50-100 ml/kg ORS 3-4 h moderate dehydration , administer 10 ml/kg/die ORS graduate glass bottle dehydration prevention cessation symptom . Three four hour , child feed normal appropriate-for-age diet include full strength lactose-containing formula cow 's milk.Treatment allocation conceal maintain single-blind status . Upon enrolment , patient 's parent receive envelope contain write prescription name ORS product instruction administer . To circumvent problem perform double-blind study commercially available product large population , use third-part blind observer method ass efficacy ORS preparation . To ensure unbiased efficacy assessment , investigator collect reporting form complete parent blind patient 's treatment assignment , whereas family pediatrician charge treatment allocation exclude efficacy assessment . The reporting form send coordinate centre Department Pediatrics analysis . We previously use procedure study 5 probiotic preparation child affect acute diarrhea ( Berni Canani R et al . BMJ 2007 ; 335-340 ) . Upon enrollment , patient undergo physical examination clinical history take identify patient , determine duration severity diarrhea , assess associate clinical feature ( fever , vomit dehydration ) establish nutritional status previous therapy . The parent enrol child instruct record daily specific form : ) number fecal outputs consistency ; ii ) amount daily ORS assume child ; iii ) possible adverse event . We also record number parent 's missed work day , number hospital admission group , use medication . Outcome measure The primary outcome study rate resolution diarrhea 72 h start oral rehydration therapy . We select time point study indicate risk dehydration high period zinc able reduce diarrhea 72 h treatment . The latter finding recently confirm Cochrane meta-analysis . Diarrhea consider stop patient pass last abnormal ( loose liquid ) stool precede normal stool output , apply previous study . Secondary outcome measure total amount ORS intake first 24 h , number miss work day parent , number hospital admission group , use medication . Safety also investigate . Sample size Fifty-seven patient group require obtain power study = 80 % , type 1 error = 0.05 , 2-tailed test consider difference 25 % ( 75 % vs 50 % ) rate resolution diarrhea 72 h study group . This estimation base preliminary data previous result obtain child acute diarrhea treat zinc . We decide enroll 65 patient per group consider possible drop 15 % . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform statistician blind individual ORS preparation receive child two group . Continuous variable express mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . For categorical variable , Pearson chi-square test perform . The two group compare continuous variable t-test equality mean . After check assumption , linear regression analysis stepwise method use study effect different variable ( age , sex , body weight , duration symptom enrollment ) presence diarrhea 72 h treatment . Analyses conduct intention-to-treat per-protocol basis . All test significance two-sided . A p value le 0.05 consider significant . The statistical analysis perform use SPSS software package Windows ( release 16.0.0 ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) Starts Direct ( release 2.6.6 ) . Table 1 .
