	<brief_summary>Fibrates reduce atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease event . A major mechanism benefit appear ability raise plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , especially patient high triglyceride level . This study investigate effect addition Trilipix ( fenofibric acid ) versus placebo ongoing statin treatment high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) composition arterial function subject insulin resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Trilipix Effects Lipids Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The field lipid treatment atheroprevention , HDL-raising particular , shake unexpected finding net adverse clinical effect torcetrapib , Cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) inhibitor HDL-raising effect far dramatic niacin fenofibrate . Trilipix ( ABT 335 , choline fenofibrate , fenofibric acid ) approve FDA ( 12/2008 ) treatment dyslipidemia may act new fibrate treatment dyslipidemia atheroprevention . It first fibrate sufficient evidence safety combination use statin receive FDA indication combination use . Thus , minimal safety risk prospective research subject , case dyslipidemia combination approve recommended . With ongoing development agent time great scientific controversy regard torcetrapib HDL , urgent explore HDL-related mechanism Trilipix may atheroprotective , special attention change HDL composition function . Novel method develop measure HDL composition function add state-of-the-art technology assemble uniquely comprehensive panel HDL parameter study . Such method employ explore potentially beneficial effect promise HDL-active agent Trilipix . In addition , improvement HDL fibrates appear relate favorable lipoprotein change , reduce remnant level increase LDL particle size , likely help explain arterial benefit agent . The recent advent validation many non-invasive method measure arterial function allow characterization arterial effect lipid agent time- cost-effective way , alternative standard event-driven trial . This study offer uniquely comprehensive panel arterial parameter order characterize likely atheropreventive effect Trilipix . This study investigate change panel endpoint ( state-of-the-art measure HDL relate lipoprotein , arterial function ) Trilipix , clearly broadly define benefit agent do lipid therapy . In addition , analyse intercorrelations change among several parameter strongly suggest mechanism atheropreventive benefit Trilipix . Finally , regard subject selection , patient insulin resistance high risk atherosclerosis , even without concurrent diabetes mellitus . Importantly , favorable effect fibrates pronounce patient insulin resistance , whether manifest traditionally central obesity , adiposity , glucose insulin abnormality . Beta-cell dysfunction , generally see conjunction insulin resistance , might also predict benefit fibrate therapy . Body composition ( adiposity central obesity ) strong correlate abnormality measure study . Already present , future , standard care insulin resistant patient statin monotherapy . In addition , however , fibrates increasingly advocate adjunctive therapy patient residual abnormality triglyceride HDL-C statin monotherapy . Thus , best way ass likely benefit Trilipix usual clinical practice set background stable statin therapy .</detailed_description>
