	<brief_title>Non-invasive Measurement Hemoglobin Retinal Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To knowledge tool exists allow direct collection hemoglobin data eye . In many eye disease ( especially diabetic hypertensive retinopathy well retinal vessel occlusion ) retinal circulation modify . Knowing hemoglobin concentration site pathology give u information pathogenesis disease may provide new possibility therapy . The purpose study test new non-invasive tool measure hemoglobin retinal artery . Healthy volunteer eye clinic pregnant otherwise healthy patient gynecological department Triemli Hospital , Zurich , well anemic gynecological patient show check-up include . Hemoglobin quantify blood draw cubital vein . Using Fundus Camera ( Nidek AFC-230 ) picture fundus take study patient . Afterwards study investigator select retinal artery interest use measure hemoglobin concentration . Intensity green channel camera chip determine aid law Lambert-Beer . Absolute Hemoglobin concentration calculate relation vessel volume .</detailed_description>
