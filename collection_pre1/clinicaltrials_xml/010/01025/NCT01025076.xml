	<brief_summary>Executive Summary Aims Hypotheses Study : The aim study evaluate safety , effectiveness early outcome StomaphyX procedure reduce enlarge gastric pouch stoma post-bariatric patient . The study test hypothesis StomaphyX procedure effective promoting loss regain weight , reduce risk comorbidities improve patient ' quality life . Type Study : Prospective non-randomized Study Duration : 12 month Number Patients : 20 Inclusion Criteria : 18-70 year age , BMI ≥ 35 , ≥ 2 year primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass evidence enlarge gastric pouch volume enlarge stoma diameter ≥ 20 mm via endoscopy fluoroscopy . Pts also demonstrate weight regain 15 % excess body weight loss . Exclusion Criteria : Esophageal stricture , anatomic condition preclude passage transoral endoluminal instrument , another causal factor weight regain stoma pouch dilatation , portal hypertension , coagulation disorder chronic use anticoagulant , active medical condition would preclude patient completing study would result unreasonable risk patient . Intervention Treatment : Creation multiple full-thickness plication within gastric pouch use StomaphyX device ( EndoGastric Solutions , Inc. , Redmond , WA , USA ) Evaluation Criteria Primary Outcome : Change body weight 6 12 month Secondary Outcome : Gastric pouch volume assessment , stoma diameter determination , quality life score , waist circumference , co-morbidity resolution Effectiveness Safety Assessment Clinical : Weight , height , waist circumference quality life questionnaire ( Impact Weight QOL-Lite , Eating Weight Patterns , Three-factor Eating , Emotional Eating Scale , GI QoL , GSRS and/or PGWB ) Anatomical : Upper GI endoscopy , compute tomography barium radiography Biochemical : Blood urine test ( glucose , cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL , LDL , uric acid ) Safety : Adverse event , complication , co-morbidities , hospital stay</brief_summary>
