	<detailed_description>information relate subject 's demographic , past medical history current medical history collect medical record . This collect research coordinator . The following sample obtain research coordinator bedside RN send UPMC laboratory evaluation . 1 teaspoon blood creatinine phosphokinase level obtain pregnancy test occur necessary - 1 teaspoon blood Screening procedures 30 minute patient 's time include , medical record review occur information relate patient past medical history , demographic , present condition , result present test collect , pregnancy test- 1 teaspoon blood , creatinine phosphokinase - 1 teaspoon blood . Additionally another CPK level obtain 36 hour post daptomycin infusion . This blood sample routine part clinical care . The bedside RN research coordinator collect blood sample send lab UPMC evaluation medical chart review complete research coordinator . patient meet entry criterion follow occur patient 's bedside room . If clinical indication require catheter remove , removal delayed purpose research study : Patient receive one dose daptomycin via IV give bedside RN 30 minute ( dose base patient 's weight- 10 milligram per kilogram ) . PK sample obtain around dose . 10 PK sample around dose Daptomycin occur- approximately 11 teaspoon ( 1 teaspoon per sample ) obtain immediately Daptomycin dosing , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 , 16 , 24 36 hour end infusion . The research coordinator come bedside bedside RN obtain sample obtain via patient 's exist IV catheter central line . 4 sample cerebrospinal fluid approximately 1 teaspoon per sample collect day daptomycin give . These sample obtain bedside RN take already exist spinal fluid drain catheter . 10 subject sample obtain 1 , 8 , 16 , 24 end daptomycin infusion 10 subject collect 2,4 , 10 36 hour end daptomycin infusion . 2 day collection PK sample patient see bedside check well patient . This take 5-10 minute patient 's time . If patient d/c home research coordinator call patient check status take 5-10 minute</detailed_description>
