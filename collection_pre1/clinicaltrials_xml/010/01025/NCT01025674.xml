	<detailed_description>This project one seven multi-site trial different program nationally implement . Oregon State University ( OSU ) University Illinois Chicago ( UIC ) conduct school-based randomized trial evaluate efficacy Positive Action program ( PA ) find program work , determine effectiveness Positive Action program reduce negative behavior ( include health-related behavior ) , increase positive behavior improve academic achievement elementary school student . The Positive Action program design promote social character development ( respect , responsibility , altruism , civic virtue , prosocial behavior ) way reduce anti-social behavior ( violence , substance use , delinquency ) improve school performance ( attendance , test score ) . Fourteen eligible school select winter 2004 comprise 7 match pair ( treatment control ) ; school match 'risk score ' compose multiple school characteristic . Students grade 3 2004-05 school year , parent , teacher principal survey baseline ( Fall 2004 ) , spring fall 2005 , spring 2006 spring 2007 . Evaluation base multiple kind process , mediator variable outcome data school record ( attendance , transience , grade , test performance , disciplinary action suspension , change school student population characteristic ) , student record , student survey , parent survey , teacher rating survey , administrator survey , collect school condition ( except information delivery Positive Action program ) . The work do OSU confine Dr. Flay 's overall supervision aspect project , data analysis use de-identified data receive Dr. DuBois UIC research paper writing . The work do UIC , direct Dr. David DuBois , include intervention work , data collection , data entering , data analysis report write . The U.S. Department Education/IES hire national contractor , Mathematica Policy Research , Inc. ( MPR ) conduct core survey sit multi-site trial spring 2007 . In addition , OSU/UIC administer site-specific student survey complementary multi-site survey wave data collection . As project funding follow Dr. Flay 's move UIC OSU September 2005 , OSU IRB provide review overall project . As April 2008 , new funding allow continuation study March 2012 follow target cohort student end 8th grade teacher principal survey fall 2008 , spring 2009 along parent spring 2010 . Data collection continuation study also include collection height weight child process evaluation data student teacher . There involvement MPR . Data collection complete June 2010 . Consent Rates Mobility : Parental consent obtain student , parent teacher complete surveys student grade 3 . Seventy-nine percent parent provide consent baseline . Students join study later wave consented time ; consent rate range 65 % 78 % Waves 2-5 . All student re-consented second phase funding Wave 6 ( begin grade 7 ) ; consent rate lower Waves 6 8 ( ≈ 58 64 % ) . This consistent previous study find consent rate drop grade level increase . The percentage consent parent provide report child 72.3 % , 58.9 % , 52.2 % , 50.5 % , 72.9 % Waves 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 8 , respectively . Two factor likely increase parent response rate Wave 8 ( 1 ) increase financial incentive complete parent report ( 2 ) intensive period phone outreach family note incentive increase encourage survey completion . Percentages consent student teacher complete rating 74.6 % , 74.8 % , 72.4 % , 78.3 % , 74.4 % , 92.7 % Waves 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , respectively . At Wave 8 , introduce additional school-level incentive 100 % rate teacher survey completion , likely result increase complete teacher rating . Mobility pattern identify use result latent class analysis 5-class solution find appropriate fit data : 1 ) stayer ( average study duration 5.72 year , N = 158 ) , 2 ) temporary participant ( 1.30 year , grade 4 5 ; N=196 ) , 3 ) late joiner ( 1.38 year ; N=308 ) ; 4 ) early leaver ( 0.94 year ; N=263 ) , 5 ) late leaver ( 3.23 year ; N=287 ) . Planned Statistical Analyses : Because trial cluster-focused , assessed student enter school begin trial ( joiner ) , follow individual student stop attend study school ( leaver ) . From standpoint student , across time could consider `` dynamic '' ( i.e . change ) grade cohort . Multilevel model use take account variation school student level . Missing data address use missing-at-random ( MAR ) assumption , unlikely single unmeasured variable set variable would predict missingness student leave joined trial school randomization We propose three-level ( occasion measurement nest within student nest within school ) growth-curve model analyze treatment effect various student-level outcome . These model account observation model school difference . This approach allow complete analysis multiple wave available data take account pattern change time . Random-intercept growth-curve model first estimate . Following random-intercept model , random-coefficient model run test whether significant variation student change across time , rather student condition change pattern . A Likelihood Ratio Chi-square ( LR ) test use compare model fit without random coefficient . If model random time coefficient provide significantly good fit give outcome , report final model . Intervention effect scales collect later wave ( Waves 5 6 onwards ) test intercept set endpoint ( Wave 8 ) condition term indicate possible difference effect last ( Wave 8 ) . Because 14 school trial , PA effect test school level cluster-randomized trial , conduct several sensitivity analysis . First , assess statistical significance PA coefficient estimate standard error use t-distribution 12 degree freedom : 14 school - 1 ( condition effect ) - 1 = 12 df provide conservative approach . A second approach pair-level analysis , estimate four-level model : occasion measurement nest within student , nest within school , nest within match pair . In addition student-level survey data , several school-level archival measure analyze . Because data school level , growth-curve model two-level ( observation within school ) rather three-level . Because small amount data ( number school time number wave ) result power limitation , analysis use random-intercept model . We test moderation gender student mobility . The moderation test reveal program effect ; , test allow u assess whether program effect differ gender child 's mobility . We test moderation ethnicity highly confounded school , 3 pair school mostly African-American enrollment 2 pair school mostly Hispanic enrollment . While 14 school retain throughout CRCT , student population trial highly mobile . Thus , important test potential moderating effect student mobility pattern . A recent approach analyze mobility pattern latent class analysis ( LCA ) . The mobility pattern describe tested moderator program effect ; , examine whether student different mobility pattern different program effect . Mediation analyse allow u examine PA program 's mechanisms action . We first estimate bivariate effect X Y without mediator include model . Then , simultaneously estimate direct effect X Y mediator include model , well mediated effect , consist effect X M × M Y .</detailed_description>
