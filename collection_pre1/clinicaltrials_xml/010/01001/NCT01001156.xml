	<brief_summary>The purpose study use associate breathing exercise incentive inspiratory load lineal pressoric , Threshold® IMT , load pressoric alinear , Voldyne® , institutionalize elderly , compare effect one train breathing musculature , increment muscular strength , express maximum breathing pressure ( MIP MEP ) . From total number admit people ( n = 52 ) , 12 individual exclude : one appearance cognitive deficit , one death ( stroke ) , one visual deficit ( glaucoma ) twelve failure continue training . After select sample , 37 participant randomly divide three different group : Threshold Group ( TG ; n = 13 , age = 70 . 93 ± 8.41 year old , BMI = 24.06 ± 3.69 kg/m² ) , Voldyne Group ( VG ; n = 12 , age = 70.54 ± 7 . 73 years-old , BMI = 27.17 ± 5.66 kg/m² ) Control Group ( CG ; n= 12 , age = 73 . 92 ± 7.28 years-old , BMI = 24.80 ± 5.42 kg/m² ) . The TG VG receive treatment respiratory exercise Threshold Voldyne muscular training , respectively . The CG receive respiratory exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The physiologic alteration age systemic seem evident institutionalize elderly . The advanced age associate decrease force skeletal muscle , well one muscle respiratory . In breathe system happen important muscle-skeletal alteration , interfere mechanic ventilatory . The change compliance thoracic wall lung stcruture result imprisonment air , air-trapping `` , increase breathe work simultaneously functional residual capacity ( FRC ) consequent decrease pressure maximum expiratory . Also decrease pick flow expiratory change curve flow-volume contribute closing outlying aerial road . This way breathe muscular function strongly harm correlated state nutritional force muscular outlying . Besides , modification curvature diaphragm , negative effect capacity generate muscular force , collaborate decrease inspiratory . The participant completely evaluate , include personal information , medical history physical examination . Measurement Translation provide gratis . MIP MEP : Before respiratory muscle training , inspiratory expiratory strength evaluate analysed maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) maximum expiratory pressure ( MEP ) , respectively . This measure use device call vacuum manometer ( analogical operational interval -120 + 120 cmH2O , Critical Med/USA-2002 display scale interval 4 cmH2O ) . During MIP measurement , nasal clip use , prevent air escape evaluation . In MIP measurement , mouth oropharynx create negative pressure alter result depend whether glottis open ( correct form ) close ( improper form ) . To prevent interference orofacial musculature MIP measurement , escape orifice place measurement instrument . This orifice relieve pressure without significantly affect pressure produce respiratory muscle . Five test carry get three acceptable measure ( i.e. , duration least 2 second absence empty ) . Acceptable test require least two reproducible measurement ( maximum difference 5 % two maximum ) . A rest least one minute test use good equalization volume ( consequently ) attainment maximum pressure . To measure MEP , patient instruct inhale reach total pulmonary capacity ( TPC ) carry support expiratory effort residual volume ( RV ) . A seated position use measure MIP MEP . Threshold Group Training : measurement initial MIP MEP ( pre-training ) , elderly individual TG submit respiratory exercise program . The research Ide et al . ( 2007 ) show program contributes increase chest expansion healthy elderly people . The program compose follow exercise : active/resistance exercise horizontal adduction-abduction flexion-extension shoulder joint ; active/resistance exercise anterior flexion associate rotation trunk lateral flexion trunk ; active/resistance exercise lateral rotation trunk ; active/resistance exercise put superior member head . The relaxation protocol consist inspiration deep expiration without accompaniment movement . After training , Threshold® IMT ( Respironics USA - 2004 ) use . This device commercially offer form transparent plastic cylinder ; one end valve keep closed positive pressure spring , end nipple . The valve block aerial flow patient generate inspiratory pressure sufficient overcome spring . The utilization Threshold research begin gradual load , start 50 % MIP individual increase 10 % per week fourth week . From fifth week , increase 5 % 100 % reach eighth week maximum pressure value Threshold IMT ( 41 cmH2O ) reach . Thereafter , value keep constant final two week . The session last 20 minute consist seven series strengthen ( 2 minute ) interval 1 minute series ; session conduct three time per week ten week . In use training program , elderly individual evaluate separately train group individualized attention . Voldyne Group Training : The respiratory exercise use TG use VG . The maximum inspiratory sustentation technique ( MIS ) use Voldyne mobilize great pulmonary volume thereby increase intra-alveolar pressure end support inspiration . The increase intra-alveolar pressure directly proportional contractile strength respiratory muscle ( diaphragm accessory ) , thus justify fact intense muscular activity require reach total pulmonary capacity ( TPC ) support inspiration level . The use EI ( Voldyne® ) incentive spirometry muscular training elderly people basis physiotherapy follow guideline . The patient 's trunk position 30º relative horizontal plane , provide diaphragmatic conscription . The device position vertically . The volume indicator visible patient provide visual biofeedback . The patient instruct carry slow deep inspiration reach TPC functional residual capacity ( FRC ) . Slow inspiration favour laminar flow . A sustentation maximum inspiration around three second recommend . Expiration occur normally FRC reach . During use Voldyne , patient hyperventilation avoid . Intervals 60 second inspiration support maximum recommend 11 . The elderly subject receive verbal command initiate new inspiration . In study , Voldyne use 20 minute , , 40 repetition 2 repetition per minute . The procedure last 10 week frequency three time per week . The group supervise intermittently twenty minute ensure hyperventilation occur . Control Group Training : This group receive respiratory exercise . The exercise compose follow exercise : active/resistance exercise horizontal adduction-abduction flexion-extension shoulder joint ; active/resistance exercise anterior flexion associate rotation trunk lateral flexion trunk ; active/resistance exercise lateral rotation trunk ; active/resistance exercise put superior member head . The relaxation protocol consist inspiration deep expiration without accompaniment movement . Statistical Treatment : The average standard deviation ( av ± sd ) calculate age , body mass index , maximum respiratory pressure functional autonomy . The normality sample evaluate Shapiro-Wilk test homogeneity variance test Levene . For within-groups analysis variable , parametric Student 's test Wilcoxon use appropriate ( homogeneous heterogeneous distribution data , respectively ) . For between-groups evaluation , nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test use follow Mann-Whitney multiple comparison test . The statistical significance level adopt p &lt; 0.05 . Excel SPSS v14.0 statistical package program use evaluate data .</detailed_description>
