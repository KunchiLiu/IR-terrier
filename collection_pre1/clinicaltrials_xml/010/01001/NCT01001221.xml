	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - Study part 1 : To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) cabazitaxel administer 1-hour infusion combination gemcitabine , every 3 week patient advance solid malignancy . - Study part 2 : To determine antitumor activity cabazitaxel combination gemcitabine , additional extend cohort 15 patient advance solid malignancy treat defined MTD , assess objective response rate ( ORR ) accord revise guideline Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST 1.1 criterion ) . Secondary Objectives : - To assess safety profile combination regimen cabazitaxel gemcitabine . - To assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) cabazitaxel , gemcitabine metabolite 2',2 ' difluorodeoxyuridine ( dFdU ) give combination . - To determine Time Progression ( TTP ) , Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) , Duration Response ( DR ) , extend cohort patient treat MTD Part 2 study patient receive MTD Part 1 component . For study part 1 , dose level escalate accord predefined dose escalation decision rule . The Maximum Administered Dose ( MAD ) reach dose level least 2 patient develop DLT first 3 week treatment . There dose escalation dose achieve . The MTD define high dose 0 1 3 6 patient , respectively , experience DLT first 3 week treatment .</brief_summary>
