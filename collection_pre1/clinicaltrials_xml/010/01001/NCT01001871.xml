	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) prevalent micronutrient deficiency worldwide basis , especially develop country . The impact severe IDA mortal consequence , since without adequate hemoglobin , brain body become deprived oxygen , allow continue , death may ensue . It show iron supplementation infant young child enhance child development , however , may also result increased rate malaria high burden area . The primary objective study determine impact provide encapsulate iron ( powder add complementary food ) susceptibility clinical malaria among anemic non-anemic infant young child ( 6-24 month age ) living high malaria burden area . The value perform research Ghana primarily malaria anemia remain important cause death morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : The propose study community-based blind randomize control trial 2 study arm conduct two phase : - Phase I take place dry season ( December April ) , malaria transmission rate low . Eligible subject ( one per household ) individually randomize receive daily dose either powdered vitamin/mineral fortificant contain 12.5 mg iron ( plus ascorbic acid , vitamin A zinc ) , placebo ( contain micronutrient exclude iron ) , add complementary food , 5 month . - Phase II take place wet season ( June October ) , malaria transmission rate higher . Eligible subject , participate Phase I , individually randomize one two study arm describe follow 5 month . A dual phase design , two unique cohort , choose preliminary result ( end phase 1 ) could assess independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee . It possible dry season impact iron detect , wet season , impact observe . With possible outcome , potentially feasible translate knowledge Ministry Health Program provide iron supplementation ( fortification ) dry month year ( December April ) .</detailed_description>
