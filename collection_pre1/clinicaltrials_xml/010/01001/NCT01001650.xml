	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety tolerability non-replicating , metabolically active Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite ( PfSPZ ) vaccine malaria-na√Øve healthy volunteer follow multiple-dose subcutaneous ( SC ) intradermal ( ID ) administration . In addition , investigator wish evaluate PfSPZ vaccine-mediated protection P. falciparum challenge follow 4 group ( see ) compare protective efficacy PfSPZ vaccine give SC v ID administration group : - Group 1 : 4 dos 7,500 PfSPZ/immunization , - Group 2 : 4 dos 30,000 PfSPZ/immunization , - Group 3 : 4 dos 135,000 PfSPZ/immunization - Group 4 : 4 6 dos 135,000 PfSPZ/immunization . If &gt; 80 % protective efficacy achieve Groups 1 , 2 , 3 , volunteer Group 4 receive fifth sixth dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial PfSPZ Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first clinical trial Pf SPZ vaccine Phase 1 trial non-immune healthy adult volunteer . Sanaria Sponsor PATH MVI fund trial . The study conduct collaborative effort Sanaria , PATH MVI , NMRC Malaria Program ( U.S. Military Malaria Vaccine Program ) , Center Vaccine Development University Maryland Baltimore ( CVD-UMB ) . The study take place NMRC Malaria Program Clinical Trials Center campus National Naval Medical Center Bethesda , MD CVD and/or General Clinical Research Center , UMB . The study design evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity protective efficacy successively high dos vaccine administer subcutaneous ( SC ) intradermal ( ID ) route . There 4 group volunteer group comprise subset volunteer receive vaccine SC route subset receive vaccine ID route . Groups 1-3 : The first 3 group receive 3 ascend dos vaccine administer 4 SC ID injection separate 4 week interval ( 7,500 PfSPZ/dose , 30,000 PfSPZ/dose , 135,000 PfSPZ/dose respectively ) . Each group challenge minimum 3 week final dose exposure A. stephensi mosquito infect P. falciparum sporozoite . All 3 group follow safety 48 week first immunization . Group 4 : Group 4 start minimum 3 week first immunization Group 3 . If &gt; 80 % efficacy one subsets Groups 1 , 2 , 3 ( SC ID ) , Group 4 volunteer receive 4 immunization ( like Group 3 ) experimental challenge ; simply follow safety 12 month first immunization . The FDA request follow group volunteer receive high dose ( 135 PfSPZ/immunization ) without challenge 3 week . However , NOT &gt; 80 % efficacy one subsets Groups 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 month observation period , Group 4 volunteer receive two additional monthly immunization ( Immunizations # 5 # 6 ) follow challenge approximately 3 week sixth immunization . All volunteer Group 4 follow safety 52 week first immunization .</detailed_description>
