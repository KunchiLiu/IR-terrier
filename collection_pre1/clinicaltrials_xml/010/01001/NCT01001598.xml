	<brief_summary>Fanconi anemia ( FA ) Dyskeratosis congenita ( DC ) inherit bone marrow failure syndrome . The current androgen treatment ( e.g. , oxymetholone ) use treat FA DC cause unwanted masculinizing side effect , indicate need different medication . Danazol le potent androgen , may therefore few masculinize side effect . Danazol currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment disease , never study patient FA DC . The main purpose study see danazol safe treatment FA DC . Specifically , would like determine : - best dose danazol ; - fast hemoglobin ( protein carry oxygen blood ) level rise FA DC patient receive danazol therapy ; - genetic pattern ( know expression profile ) certain cell response danazol , predict well people respond medication . Subjects enroll study treat danazol 24 week ( 6 month ) , 11 study visit , include followup visit 38 week ( 9 month ) 52 week ( one year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Trial Danazol Patients With Fanconi Anemia Dyskeratosis Congenita</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient either Fanconi anemia ( FA ) Dyskeratosis congenita ( DC ) initially receive danazol dose 5 mg/kg/d orally , round near 100 mg. For first 8 week , patient evaluate week 2 , 5 , 8 hematologic response ( HR ) . If patient show hematological response ( either hemoglobin platelet value longer meet blood cell count criterion protocol inclusion absence recent transfusion ) within first 12 week initial dose , study drug continue dose next 6 week . If patient fail show hematologic response within first 12 week , dose escalate 10 mg/kg/day next 6 week , additional monitoring visit require week 14 . If week 18 , patient fail show hematological response increase dose , dose increase 15 mg/kg/day another 6 week ( exceed 800 mg/day ) , additional monitoring visit require week 20 . At 24 week , response dose patient take study drug classify treatment failure , monitor week 38 week 52 ) . After week 24 , patient continue show response , however , study drug may continue discretion primary care physician , monitoring week 38 52 . Should patient lose hematologic response 5 10 mg/kg/day dose point within first 18 week treatment , dose escalate 10 15 mg/kg/day ( exceed 800 mg/day ) , respectively . The patient continue evaluate next visit . If week 24 hematologic improvement see , patient take study drug monitor week 38 52 .</detailed_description>
