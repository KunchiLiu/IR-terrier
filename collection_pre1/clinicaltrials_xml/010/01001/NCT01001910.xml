	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pemetrexed disodium carboplatin work treat patient recurrent ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Carboplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate combination pemetrexed ( pemetrexed disodium ) ( Alimta ) carboplatin ( Paraplatin ) recurrent ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free interval , overall survival , adverse effect among patient receive drug combination . OUTLINE : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously ( IV ) 8-15 minute carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
