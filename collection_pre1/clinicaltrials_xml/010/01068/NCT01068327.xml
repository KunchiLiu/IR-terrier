	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose stereotactic radiation therapy nelfinavir mesylate give together gemcitabine hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Stereotactic radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs , nelfinavir mesylate , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving stereotactic radiation therapy nelfinavir mesylate together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety , dose-limiting toxicity maximally tolerate dose hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy concurrently nelfinavir patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer give part neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate surgical complete resection rate . II . To evaluate pathological response . III . To evaluate tumor response compute tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . IV . To evaluate correlation radiologic response pathologic response . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure phospho-AKT expression pancreatic tumor tissue prior follow neoadjuvant chemo-radiation program . ( Correlative ) II . To measure nelfinavir pharmacokinetics steady-state . ( Correlative ) III . To measure pharmacogenomic status CYP2C19*2 ( G681A ) study population . ( Correlative ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) concurrent nelfinavir mesylate . NEOADJUVANT THERAPY : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 30 minute , fluorouracil IV continuously 24 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive nelfinavir mesylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) begin week 9 continue completion SRT 14 day completion SRT . Patients undergo concurrent SRT daily 5 day week 11 . SURGERY AND ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY : Approximately 2-3 week completion SRT , patient undergo restaging evaluate disease response . Patients resectable potentially resectable disease metastasis undergo definitive surgery 2-3 week later . Approximately 1 month surgery , patient receive three additional course gemcitabine hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil . Patients unresectable disease stable responsive time surgical exploration may resume treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients metastatic disease time restaging remove study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
