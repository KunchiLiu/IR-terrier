	<brief_summary>People survive severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) live profound cognitive impairment alter developmental course define future possibility . Worldwide , TBI lead cause death disability among child adolescent ( Murgio , 2000 ) . In United States , annual incidence TBI six time great multiple sclerosis , HIV/AIDS , spinal cord injury , breast cancer combine [ Centers Disease Control , American Cancer Society , National Multiple Sclerosis Society ] . The burden TBI may even great develop country , due civil unrest war , absence mandate prevention seat belt law . The long-term objective investigator ' research group improve outcomes survivor TBI Latin America . To end , investigator create structure professional institution involve treatment TBI generate research ; facilitate education , standardization , certification , dissemination information resource ; foster development evidence-based guideline . The structure Latin American Brain Injury Consortium ( LABIC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Improve Outcomes Survivors Traumatic Brain Injury Latin America</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective application establish network Centers Excellence within LABIC , collaboration U.S. partner , conduct research training program TBI . To end , project include scientific investigation capacity building . The primary focus scientific investigation conduct high quality randomize control trial address question critical importance management TBI worldwide : â€¢ Does use information provide intracranial pressure ( ICP ) monitor direct treatment patient TBI improve medical practice patient outcomes develop country ? This trial conduct three trauma center Bolivia , infrastructures practice pattern optimal strong internal validity , time level resource representative trauma care practice develop world . The secondary focus scientific investigation conduct prospective study TBI seven trauma center Bolivia , Brazil , Argentina , Colombia , Ecuador represent variation access use resource develop world . This study address two question vital importance management TBI develop country : - To extent finding randomize trial ICP monitoring particular , brain injury care general , generalize diverse population TBI patient Latin America ? - What association resource outcomes TBI develop country ? To build capacity , provide education , equipment , structure , foster collaboration establish pilot R21 phase project . Our commitment LABIC become completely independent research entity . At end funding period LABIC constituent able identify important research question , design research , write successful proposal funding , carry strong study , analyze interpret data , submit successful publication internationally recognize peer review journal , disseminate information across Latin America . Our specific aim : Specific Aim # 1 : In randomize controlled trial 3 trauma center Bolivia , test effect outcomes management severe TBI guide information ICP monitor vs. standard empiric protocol . Hypothesis # 1 : Patients severe TBI whose acute care treatment manage use ICP monitor significantly low mortality well neuropsychological functional recovery 6 month post-trauma whose treatment manage standard protocol . Hypothesis # 2 : The incorporation ICP monitoring care patient severe TBI minimize secondary complication decrease length stay intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Specific Aim # 2 : In prospective , observational study conduct trauma center Latin America , test association resource availability/medical management outcomes patient severe TBI . Hypothesis # 3 : The association treatment outcomes patient severe TBI identify randomize trial ICP monitoring generalize population prospective , observational , multi-center , multi-national study . Hypothesis # 4 : Variations resource availability medical management significantly associate mortality functional recovery patient severe TBI , control patient injury characteristic . Specific Aim # 3 : Establish network research center investigator train skilled design , conduct , fund research program address TBI brain disorder Latin America . In fulfil aim , answer important research question patient characteristic , treatment , outcomes TBI environment limit resource , aspect generalize develop country well developed world . In develop country , test effectiveness technology consider pivotal brain trauma treatment develop world - ICP monitor . The outcome trial may serve standardize practice , improve outcome , mobilize resource worldwide . A randomized control trial ICP monitoring never perform . As specifically state Guidelines Management Severe Brain Injury ( Bullock et al. , 1996 ) , critical gap evidence base support role ICP monitoring TBI care . As , result RCT perform Bolivia global implication regardless level development trauma system . We also establish sustainable capacity conduct research TBI Latin America . Within structure LABIC , create cadre professional train clinical research equip carry study answer question important Latin America . These study establish literature base Latin American treatment guideline generate . With train cognitive assessment , introduce new discipline many Latin American medical system provide understanding unique profound disability associate brain disorder .</detailed_description>
