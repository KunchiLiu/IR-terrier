	<brief_summary>This study look global gene expression pterygium find derangement matrix gene particular feature pterygium . In investigator opinion , would beneficial elicit change gene expression recurrence pterygium develop panel biomarkers associate pterygium recurrence ; one would able predict post surgical prognosis patient resection.Biomarker level compare discover biomarker panel prediction recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors Biomarkers Associated With Recurrence After Excision Primary Pterygium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A comprehensive questionnaire use evaluate environmental , biological , physical behavioral risk factor associate recurrence pterygium excision . Slit lamp digital color photograph take primary recurrent pterygium pterygium grade three level severity , base relative transparency pterygium tissue ; grade 1 ( transparent ) , grade 2 ( intermediate ) , grade 3 ( opaque ) see whether risk factor correlate morphology pterygium . Tear sample collect surgery use schirmers strip.Proteins tear sample analyze use iTRAQ method . The transcriptional difference pterygium conjunctival tissue sample analyze use western blot , qPCR immunohistochemistry assay .</detailed_description>
