	<brief_title>Letrozole RAD001 With Advanced Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Everolimus design stop cancer cell multiply . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , may cause tumor cell die . Letrozole design block chemical pathway necessary tumor growth . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take 2 pill everolimus mouth 1 time every day . You open everolimus take absorbs moisture sensitive light . You also take 1 pill letrozole mouth 1 time every day . You take letrozole time everolimus . Everolimus take time every day empty stomach ( fast state ) light , fat-free meal . You wait least 6 hour eat regular ( fat-free meal ) take everolimus . You eat fatty food least 1 hour take everolimus . If swallow tablet , tablet dissolve glass 2 tablespoon water take . The tablet stir gently ( maximum 7 minute ) tablet dissolve . The content drunk . If vomit take study drug , take another tablet day . If forgot take drug one day , take extra dose next day instead contact doctor advice . You give diary record pill take day . You must bring diary visit . While study , avoid grapefruit , grapefruit juice , product contain grapefruit . There also certain drug take study . You take drug study without ask study doctor first . Study Visits : Every 4 week , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature ) . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , include check liver kidney measure level sugar blood , level fat blood . - You ask side effect experience . - If disease pelvis , pelvic exam . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn hepatitis test . - Your pill count . At Week 8 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - You CT and/or MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . Other area scan doctor think need . - Any tumor measure . The doctor either feel tumor CT , x-ray , and/or MRI use . - If disease chest , chest CT and/or MRI scan check status disease . - You ask side effect experience . After Week 8 Visit , follow test procedure . ( If disease partially completely respond study drug , test do around Week 12 . If disease stable , test do around Week 16 . ) - You physical exam . - You CT and/or MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . Other area scan doctor think need . - Any tumor measure . The doctor either feel tumor CT scan , x-ray , and/or MRI use . - If disease chest , chest CT and/or MRI scan check status disease . After Week 12 16 visit , every 12 week , follow test procedure perform : - You pelvic exam . - You CT and/or MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . Other area scan doctor think need . I-f disease chest , chest CT and/or MRI scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue receive additional cycle study treatment . You take study experience intolerable side effect , disease get bad , disease completely respond , doctor think best interest . End Treatment Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug , end-of-treatment visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You pelvic exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , include check liver kidney measure level sugar blood , level fat blood . - You CT and/or MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . Other area scan doctor think need . - If disease chest , chest CT and/or MRI scan check status disease . - Your pill count unused study drug return . Long Term Follow-up : After study , follow doctor regular basis . How often visit occur doctor . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You pelvic exam . - Your performance status record . - You ask experienced intolerable side effect . - You CT and/or MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . Other area scan doctor think need . - If disease chest , chest CT and/or MRI scan check status disease . This investigational study . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available . At time , everolimus use research . Letrozole FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer ovarian cancer . The combination everolimus letrozole study treatment endometrial cancer also investigational . Up 42 patient take part multicenter study . Up 42 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
