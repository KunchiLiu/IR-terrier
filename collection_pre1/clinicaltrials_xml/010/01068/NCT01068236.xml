	<detailed_description>Obesity currently major US public health problem , give prevalence adverse health consequence . In past two decade , percentage overweight adolescent almost triple 5 14 % . Clinic-based weight control treatment youth demonstrate success , design pre-adolescent child family . Even though considerable research explore adult-weight control grow body research examine childhood obesity , treatment adolescent adequately study . Also , almost empirically tested intervention youth base academic research clinic rather primary care medical setting , weight problem often identify may efficiently treat . Placing adolescent weight-related intervention primary medical care setting could make easily disseminate cost-effective . Finally , treat obesity primary care ( non-school ) setting may particularly effective/appropriate teen girl two reason . First , overweight girl high risk normal-weight peer engage unhealthy weight-control behavior . Second , researcher speculate teen girl ' self-consciousness mixed-gender physical education ( PE ) class may contribute low enrollment rate enrollment PE class overall decline physical activity recent year . If , target physical activity primary-care-based program may successful school-based program . We propose examine clinical effectiveness incremental cost-effectiveness primary care-based multi-component lifestyle intervention overweight adolescent female family . This multi-component intervention tailor gender developmental stage , include behaviorally-based intervention teens parent well coordinate feedback counsel adolescent 's pediatric primary care provider ( PCP ) . We compare primary care-based intervention usual-care control condition adolescent family receive information weight loss guideline achieve maintain healthy lifestyle along encouragement utilize appropriate health care service .

H1 : We hypothesize treatment group great decrease BMI z-score baseline 12 month control youth . In addition , include follow secondary aim exploratory intend hypothesis-generating rather hypothesis-testing activity : Determine dietary intake ( total energy intake , % calorie fat , etc . ) and/or physical activity mediate effect intervention BMI z score . H2 : Change dietary intake physical activity baseline 6 month mediate relationship intervention change BMI z score baseline 12 month . Determine impact experimental intervention overweight adolescent family secondary outcome include physiological parameter ( triglyceride , cholesterol , fast insulin ) , quality life , psychosocial functioning ; participant safety ( depression disorder eating behavior ) ; feasibility/acceptability intervention ( e.g. , participant provider satisfaction ) preparation future Phase III trial . Determine incremental cost-effectiveness intervention relative usual care societal perspective . We examine direct cost deliver intervention treatment 's impact subsequent use cost health service .
