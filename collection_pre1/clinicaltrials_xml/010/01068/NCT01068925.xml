	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study Between GSK1349572 Tipranavir/Ritonavir Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The construction new antiretroviral regimen GSK1349572 raltegravir-resistant subject likely require less commonly use agent tipranavir enfuvirtide . Ritonavir-boosted tipranavir ( TPV/RTV ) show induce drug metabolize enzyme lead decrease exposure antiretrovirals thus necessitate drug interaction study GSK1349572 GSK1349572 eliminate primarily metabolism . This single-center , single sequence , open-label , three-period study , adult male female healthy subject . Approximately 18 subject receive GSK1349572 50mg QD 5 day ( Treatment A ) . Subjects administer TPV/RTV 500/200mg BID 7 day ( Treatment B ) follow combination GSK1349572 50mg QD TPV/RTV 500/200mg 5 day ( Treatment C ) . There washout period treatment . Safety evaluation collect treatment period . Serial PK sample GSK1349572 collect compare Treatment A C. A follow-up visit occur 7-14 day last dose study drug . The study conduct one centre US healthy adult male female subject . ViiV Healthcare new sponsor study , GlaxoSmithKline process update system reflect change sponsorship .</detailed_description>
