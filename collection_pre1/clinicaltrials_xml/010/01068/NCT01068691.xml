	<brief_summary>A dissecting intramural haematoma thoracic aorta ( AH ) haemorrhage dissects aortic wall . An entry point detect intimal tear , ulcer plaque rupture via image almost 50 % case . AH occur old patient AD develop atheromatous lesion parietal ulcer , often case poorly manage , pre-existing hypertension ( HTN ) . Type A AHs , affect ascend aorta , frequently progress towards AD high risk mortality , represent surgical indication . Patients present AD AH , whether operate , must undergo prolonged monitoring . This involve clinical radiological check ensure blood pressure properly monitor , parietal lesion recede complication . HTN recognize risk factor onset AD systolic blood pressure must bring 100 120 mmHg perioperatively . Furthermore , HTN also risk factor rupture unoperated type B AD . Despite , two study look BP management AD patient . The first , carry among chronic type A B AD patient reveal closer monitor blood pressure level home lead good long-term prognosis . Another study reveal 60 % prevalence non-managed clinical HTN among 40 chronic AD patient . Whilst frequent , regular aortic wall monitoring via image method ( CT MRI ) recommend thoracic AD surgery , precise recommendation method BP monitor high-risk patient . A BP level 135/80 mmHg suggest maximum limit patient operate AD . In order achieve , antihypertensives several therapeutic class must use , beta-blockers priority . The say AH , demonstrate absence beta-blocker treatment predictive factor poor progress . Increased aortic stiffness cause increase systolic blood pressure recognize independent cardiovascular risk factor . This stiffness detect measure carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) . No study yet focus assess aortic stiffness patient undergone AD AH surgery . Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) thoracic AD patient highly prevalent , respiratory event occur severe . This prompt suggest systematic detection OSAS AD carry . No finding yet publish patient undergone AH surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main objective : - To evaluate level blood pressure control use ambulatory blood pressure monitoring patient undergone surgery type A thoracic AD AH . Secondary objective : - To study aortic stiffness within patient population determine predictive parameter . - To determine prevalence OSAS among patient population study relationship respiratory data blood pressure value . - To determine respective role blood pressure level , aortic stiffness , respiratory biological parameter upon postoperative aortic diameter patient undergone surgery type A thoracic AD AH .</detailed_description>
