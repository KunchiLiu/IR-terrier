	<brief_summary>Pancreatoduodenectomy ( PD ) perform many high volume center low mortality . Reduced mortality rate largely result careful patient selection , improve intraoperative management well postoperative care . Unfortunately , similar reduction morbidity rate remain 40 % . Persistent morbidity predominantly due pancreatic fistula ( PF ) . Abdominal abscess hemorrhage common sequela PF associate high mortality rate . While many different risk factor report , soft pancreatic texture nondilated pancreatic duct consistently link high rate PF . A number method reduce incidence PF propose analyse . Many involve technical feature anastomosis , include site reconstruction , anastomotic technique , use biologic glue , prophylactic use somatostatin analogue . The placement stent pancreatic anastomosis attractive strategy reduce PF rate . This multicenter prospective randomize trial design compare outcome PD external drainage stent versus stent patient high risk PF ( soft pancreas diameter wirsung &lt; 3mm ) . Analysis : The primary objective study compare incidence PF patient without external pancreatic stent . With anticipated PF rate 30 % , base literature experience , calculate reduction 10 % PF rate would require inclusion 75 patient group ( statistical significance P &lt; 0.05 power 80 per cent two-tailed test proportion ) . We 'll enroll 158 patient take account possibility 5 % lose follow-up .</brief_summary>
