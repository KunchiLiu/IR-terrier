	<detailed_description>Coronary Heart Disease ( CHD ) remain significant problem US , cause 1 every 5 death 2005 . In 2009 , approximately 1.3 million Americans new/recurrent myocardial infarction . Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) include myocardial infarction , stable unstable angina , demonstrate myocardial ischemia detect noninvasive testing , history coronary artery procedure ( stent bypass ) . Currently , `` statin '' recommend AHA manage elevate low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) . Unfortunately , discontinuation statin quite substantial . For example , large cohort study old patient find 2-year statin adherence rate approximately 40 % acute coronary syndrome patient , 36 % chronic coronary artery disease , 25 % primary prevention associate increased mortality , hospitalization , cost . Recently , kinesin 6 ( KIF6 ) gene associate 30-55 % increase cardiovascular event individual carry one two risk variant ( ~57 % white population ) multiple prospective study . Furthermore , KIF6 carriers receive `` statin '' substantial great cardiovascular risk reduction ( -34 50 % ) use `` statin '' compare non-carriers use statin ( 6 20 % ) . In prospective , open label , trial , recruit subject recently start statin therapy provide information KIF6 carrier status follow 6 month determine `` statin '' adherence . Additionally , quality life factor adherence measure baseline 6 month . Finally , pharmacy record evaluate 1-year determine statin discontinuation rate .</detailed_description>
