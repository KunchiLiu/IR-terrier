	<brief_title>Test Efficacy Biodegradable Permanent Limus-Eluting Stents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restenosis affect 20-40 % de novo coronary lesion treat bare-metal stent . Although often consider benign process , recent data indicate in-stent restenosis negative impact long-term survival patient treat coronary stent . Drug elute stent emerge effective strategy prevention restenosis . A large number study show drug-eluting stent significantly reduce in-stent restenosis subsequent need target vessel revascularisation compare bare-metal stent . Available evidence show 3 limus drug − rapamycin , everolimus biolimus − effective suppress neointima formation coronary stenting . Drugs fully release within week majority current DES . However , DES use permanent polymer , continue remain vessel wall even accomplish drug-release mission . Their permanent presence may associate persistent inflammatory reaction delay neointimal proliferation vessel thrombosis . Clinical trial evidence biodegradable polymer DES still limit , great expectation DES technology might dominant one year come .</detailed_description>
