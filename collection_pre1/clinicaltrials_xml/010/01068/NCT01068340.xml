	<brief_summary>The formation intraperitoneal adhesion follow abdominal surgery accept clinician inevitable consequence . More 90 % patient undergoing surgical procedure abdomen develop intraperitoneal adesions . The incidence however , small bowel obstruction ( SBO ) result form adhesion far low . To date , unknown risk factor predispose patient develop SBO . Several propose , age , peritonitis , surgery small bowel injury result gunshot . None however , widely accept . During last 20 year significant lifetime risk associate phenomenon impact quality life patient well recognize . In addition , burden healthcare resource due complication cause adhesion increase medicolegal consequence rapidly evolve . Early SBO follow laparotomy trauma poorly describe entity . A retrospective , single institution study low number patient try address issue . However , study either include subset trauma patient , i.e . patient sustain penetrate trauma , [ 4 ] patient undergoing negative non-therapeutic laparotomy , examine incidence SBO require surgical intervention . In addition , recent data regard issue lacking , especially implementation damage control concept advance trauma surgery . The aim study define incidence early SBO follow laparotomy trauma examine possible risk factor associate development .</brief_summary>
