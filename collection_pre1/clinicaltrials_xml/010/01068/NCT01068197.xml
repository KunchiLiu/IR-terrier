	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1. compare two diet plan - low-glycemic load ( low-GL ) diet low-fat diet . A low-GL diet expect keep blood sugar level normal , sugar level stay normal , prevent rapid rise insulin blood . We want test Hispanic child at-risk type 2 diabetes give low-GL diet less insulin resistance , lose weight , decrease chance get type 2 diabetes . 2. compare effect Low-GL high-GL meal appetitive , hormonal , metabolic response obese Hispanic youth control , standardized condition . We want test child feed low-GL meal would lower glucose low insulin response , report less hunger consume less energy feed high-GL meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overweight among minority child adolescent prevalent pediatric public health problem United States . Our preliminary study find prevalence overweight among Hispanic child adolescent Washington DC twice U.S. national average . It well establish overweight associate medical psychosocial complication , particularly minority population . Study overweight Hispanic child show high risk insulin resistance impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , IGT present 28 % overweight Latino child family history type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . Despite urgency develop effective strategy treat obesity prevent T2DM child , randomize control trial weight management conduct Hispanic child . Hence , urgent need develop effective , feasible culturally competent obesity treatment program target Hispanic youth great risk obesity-associated co-morbidities , represent fast grow segment U.S. population . A low-glycemic index ( GI ) glycemic load ( GL ) diet much discuss , quite controversial treatment obesity . Some , epidemiological study show low risk diabetes among individual consume low-GL diet . Short-term clinical study examine hormonal biochemical response low-GI diet document reduction reactive hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia , decrease food intake . We propose low GL diet may particularly effective dietary regimen overweight Latino child risk T2DM , high consumption process refine carbohydrate food . The overall aim project determine hormonal , metabolic , body composition change occur two-year period consumption low-GL meal compare low fat meal among Latino child risk T2DM . Our specific aim : - Specific Aim 1 : To study short- long-term effect low-GL diet insulin sensitivity overweight Latino child risk T2DM . Hypothesis 1 : Insulin sensitivity increase great extent child randomize low-GL diet child randomize reduced-fat meal prescription 3 , 12 , 24 month . The increase insulin sensitivity find low-GL diet fully explain change BMI alone . - Specific Aim 2 : To determine short- long-term effect low-GL diet BMI z-score body fat change overweight Latino child risk T2DM . Hypothesis 2 : BMI z-score body fat proportion decrease great extent child randomize low-GL diet child randomize reduced-fat meal prescription 3 , 12 , 24 month observation period . - Specific Aim 3 : To examine effect low-GL diet marker metabolic risk overweight Latino child risk T2DM . Hypothesis 3 : Both traditional risk factor ( e.g . systolic blood pressure , LDL-cholesterol , triglyceride ) non-traditional risk factor ( e.g . inflammatory [ C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , Plasminogen activate inhibitor -1 ] , adipocyte-derived factor [ adiponectin , resistin , free fatty acid ] ) , related insulin sensitivity lower low-GL meal group compare reduced-fat meal group 3 , 12 , 24 month . - Specific Aim 4 : To examine subjective , hormonal , metabolic response obese Hispanic youth consumption low-glycemic load high glycemic load meal control , standardized condition . Hypothesis 4 : compare group feed high glycemic load meal , low glycemic load group lower glucose low insulin response , low glycemic load group report less hunger meal great satiety meal , low glycemic load group consume less energy post-meal ad libitum snack platter . Latino child age 7-14y BMI≥95th percentile at-risk T2DM randomly assign either low-GL low-fat dietary plan 2 year . Subjects also participate culturally competent , family-based intervention program include behavior modification enhance physical activity . The frequence intervention consist weekly visit 12 week ( Phase 1 ) , monthly visit 9 month ( Phase 2 ) , 3-monthly visit 12 month ( Phase 3 ) . After completion Phase 1 , subject admit GCRC 24-hour period participate meal study . Subjects provide standardized meal consist either low-glycemic load ( low-GL group ) high-glycemic load ( high-GI group ) , subjective , hormonal , metabolic response assess .</detailed_description>
