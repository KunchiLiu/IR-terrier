	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety activity regorafenib participant advance gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) standard approve therapy , imatinib sunitinib , fail control disease . Regorafenib drug block abnormally active signal enzymes call `` tyrosine kinase '' important growth GIST . This `` tyrosine kinase inhibition '' similar way imatinib sunitinib work ; however , regorafenib block certain additional signaling pathway block imatinib sunitinib . Regorafenib test GIST participant research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- In research study , plan `` cycle '' study last 4 week . In first cycle , participant come clinic Days 1 , 15 16 . For cycle 2 4 , come clinic Days 1 15 cycle . For cycle 5 beyond , come clinic Day 1 cycle . Repeat tumor image performed end every 2 cycle study drug administration ( e.g . end cycle 2 , 4 , 6 , etc . ) - During cycle , participant take regorafenib mouth , day morning , 3 week follow one week take regorafenib ( `` rest period '' ) . - FDG-PET/CT ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan require part study monitor effect study drug participant 's GIST . The first scan take place first dose study drug . If first scan show `` tracer sugar '' collection increase participant 's GIST , 5 additional scan perform different time point throughout participation research study . - Participants may continue participate research study long serious side effect disease get bad .</detailed_description>
