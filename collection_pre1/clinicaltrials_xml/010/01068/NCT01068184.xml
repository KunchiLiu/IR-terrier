	<brief_summary>AZD6553 new drug develop possible treatment patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . COPD refer chronic bronchitis emphysema , pair two commonly co-existing disease lung airways become inflame small airsacs lung become damage . This lead limitation flow air lung cause shortness breath . In contrast asthma , limitation airflow poorly reversible usually get progressively bad time . There urgent medical need therapy could slow disease progression target underlying mechanism associate change lung patient COPD . AZD6553 act reduce activity protease find involved disease process COPD . AZD6553 develop novel oral treatment control symptoms exacerbation COPD , reduce progression severity disease . The purpose research study determine safe well-tolerated AZD6553 much AZD6553 enters blood circulation collect blood urine sample study . We also investigate AZD6553 broken , give orally , much drug clear body via kidney , effect take drug food . This do analysis blood urine sample take various point study .</brief_summary>
