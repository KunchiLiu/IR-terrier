	<brief_title>Reducing Length Stay Veterans Hospitalized With Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumonia 3rd lead medical discharge diagnosis VA , although significant attention focus improve pneumonia process care measure less attention pay resource use , specifically length hospital stay ( LOS ) . Based preliminary analysis LOS considerably high VA versus non-federal hospital . Major cause increase length stay delay conversion intravenous ( IV ) oral therapy upon reach clinical stability , discharge day conversion oral antibiotic . Therefore additional intervention need decrease LOS veteran hospitalize pneumonia VA system . The long-term goal research develop sustainable approach reduce LOS thereby improve efficiency care veteran admit pneumonia VA Medical Centers implementation computerize clinical stability reminder . Although prior research , include , demonstrate moderate effectiveness resource intense method implement criterion ( e.g. , utilization management nurse ) new , effective less resource intense , strategy need accomplish long-term goal . The design computerized clinical stability reminder , likely range magnitude response implementation intervention , logistics data collection , data management , development study instrument need prior commencement definitive , multi-center study . Hence , seek funding conduct necessary pilot work need successfully design implement large multi-center randomize intervention study reduce LOS veteran pneumonia . Our objective include : 1 ) Develop perform local pilot implementation inpatient clinical reminder within Computerized Patient Record System identify veteran hospitalize pneumonia clinically stable ready conversion form IV oral antibiotic therapy hospital discharge . 2 ) Test measure construct Theory Planned Behavior ( TPB ) VA medicine ward physicians determine correlate intention discharge behavior . 3 ) Establish collaborative VA Medical Centers purpose develop large scale implementation study use evidence-based criterion reduce LOS patient hospitalize pneumonia . 4 ) Prepare VA HSR &amp; D IIR grant proposal cluster randomize control trial clinical reminder intervention reduce length hospital stay among veteran hospitalize pneumonia . The propose pilot study develop implement computerized-based inpatient clinical reminder assist physician appropriate conversion IV oral antibiotic discharge day veteran hospitalize pneumonia . In addition create implement clinical reminder single tertiary care VA teaching hospital , examine physician attitude potential barriers/facilitators introduction inpatient clinical reminder use theoretical model TPB . We also assemble cohort VA medical center investigator chiefs medical staff willing participate multi-center randomize control trial intervention . The result pilot study use plan large , definitive multi-center trial inpatient clinical reminder goal significantly reduce LOS veteran hospitalize pneumonia VA health care system .</detailed_description>
