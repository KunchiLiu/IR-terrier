	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine recommended phase II dose MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinibin combination standard erlotinib hydrochloride therapy patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) failure least one prior chemotherapy regimen , whose EGFR-expression status positive unknown . - To determine safety , tolerability , toxicity profile , dose-limiting toxicity , pharmacokinetic profile MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib erlotinib hydrochloride schedule . - To determine correlation , , toxicity profile pharmacokinetics . - To assess anti-tumor activity MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib combination erlotinib hydrochloride evidence response rate , clinical benefit ( complete partial response stable disease ≥ 8 week duration ) , exploratory endpoint early assessment tumor size continuous variable ( compare erlotinib hydrochloride alone ) . - To assess one-year survival rate patient . - To investigate correlation , , response biomarkers , include EGFR gene mutation , EGFR gene amplification , EGFR gene polymorphism , c-Met gene mutation , amplification expression , phospho-c-Met expression , K-Ras gene mutation , baseline serum HGF level . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation phase I study MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib follow randomize , open-label phase II study . - Phase I ( dose-escalation ) : Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Patients receive oral MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor GSK1363089 daily day 15-28 course 1 day 1-28 course . Courses repeat every 28 day maximum-tolerated dose MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib determine . Blood sample collect day 14 28 course 1 pharmacokinetics day 1 course 1 2 post treatment pharmacodynamic study . - Phase II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : - Arm I ( MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib erlotinib hydrochloride ) : Patients receive oral MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib ( recommend phase II dose determine phase I ) daily oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) : Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , sample collect pharmacodynamic study phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 4 every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
