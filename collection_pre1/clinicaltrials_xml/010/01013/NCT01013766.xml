	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics GSK1362885 Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first administration single dos GSK1362885 target population T2DM . Based mechanism action involve reduce hepatic glucose output , possible day time ( AM ) night time ( PM ) dose GSK1362885 could produce different plasma glucose lower effect , act either prandial post-absorptive elevation HGO . This study design compare glucose profile follow AM PM dose determine advantage either one . This study compare glucose profile follow single dose GSK1362885 morning breakfast ( AM ) single dose administer night ( PM ) . These two dose period randomize subject receive dosing regimen . A third dosing period ( BID ) randomize , include explore effect GSK1362885 glucose profile administer twice daily 24 hour timeframe .</detailed_description>
