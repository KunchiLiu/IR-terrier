	<brief_title>A Comparison Investigational Dressing Tegaderm Matrix Wound Dressing Management Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study compare effect investigational , non-adherent dress commercial wound dressing , 3M™ Tegaderm™ Matrix Dressing PHI™ technology ( Matrix dress ) , management diabetic foot ulcer . Subjects ' wound observe four week , pre-treatment period wound assessment make sample wound fluid tissue collect analyzed characterize wound . Following pre-treatment observational stage , subject continue meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomly assign , stratification center , wound size wound duration , either two group eight week treatment stage study . Subjects one group wind manage investigational non-adherent dressing , subject group wind manage Matrix dress . At Visit 4 ( start treatment stage study ) , subject study wind less 1 cm2 point drop study . A second investigational device use measure pH wound , compare wound heal data . Pre-treatment Stage Secondary Objectives 1 . To measure compare change wind size wound assessment change wind biomarker level , wound pH , microbial load , change systemic level C-reactive protein homocysteine . 2 . To measure compare change wind biomarker level , pH , microbial load , change systemic ( blood ) level C-reactive protein homocysteine , look relationship . Treatment Stage Secondary Objectives 1 . To measure compare incidence adverse event experience subject 2 treatment group . 2 . To measure compare wound characteristic treatment group . 3 . To measure compare subject ' quality life treatment group . 4 . To measure compare cost effectiveness treatment group . 5 . To measure compare change wind size change wind biomarker level , pH , microbial load ; change systemic ( blood ) level C-reactive protein homocysteine . 6 . To measure compare change wind biomarker level , pH , microbial load , change systemic level C-reactive protein homocysteine , look relationship within treatment group overall . 7 . To assess ease use dress Post-treatment Stage Secondary Objectives Subjects whose wound heal prior Visit 12 expect follow-up appointment 12-14 week wound heal . Subjects whose wound heal Visit 12 expect complete follow-up appointment 12-14 week last appointment . The objective determine frequency complete heal two treatment group determine number wound healed end treatment phase remain healed group follow-up appointment . The objective measure compare percentage wound heal Visit 12 ( ) remain healed follow-up appointment treatment group .</detailed_description>
