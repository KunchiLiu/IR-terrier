	<brief_summary>There systemic therapy approve United States Europe treat advanced recurrent endometrial cancer ( EC ) . This study evaluate safety preliminary efficacy XL147 advance recurrent EC . Constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase ( PI3K ) /phosphatase tensin homolog chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) pathway signal common EC involve development and/or progression disease . PTEN deficiency and/or activate mutations/amplification PIK3CA gene encodes p110α catalytic subunit PI3K frequently detect EC patient . XL147 potent highly selective inhibitor Class I PI3K family lipid kinase . In addition , vivo preclinical data demonstrate XL147 target proximal distal signal PI3K/PTEN pathway . Therefore , XL147 may utility treatment subject advance recurrent EC .</brief_summary>
