After receive assign Stage 1 treatment 12 week , participant assess see respond Stage 1 treatment . If child respond Stage 1 treatment , continue treatment another 12 week Stage 2 . A different treatment sequence use respond Stage 1 treatment non-responders re-assigned 1 3 alternative intervention condition . For example , respond JAE-AAC intensity JAE-AAC treatment increase . Those respond , JAE-EMT treatment randomly assign either intense JAE-EMT condition , original JAE-AAC implement Stage 1 .
