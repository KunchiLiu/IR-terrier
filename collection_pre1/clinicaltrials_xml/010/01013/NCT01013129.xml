	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gathering information genetic environmental factor may help doctor learn person 's risk develop prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study gene , environment , prostate cancer risk patient without prostate cancer first-degree relative .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Genes , Environment , Prostate Cancer Risk Patients With Without Prostate Cancer Their First-Degree Relatives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate evidence familial aggregation prostate cancer identify homogenous subgroup family elevate likelihood aggressive disease ( `` high familial risk '' ) use family case-control design . - To determine genetic variation select gene involve reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) detoxification ( e.g. , glutathione superoxide dismutase gene ) oxidative stress response ( e.g. , NFE2 ) independently jointly associate great mitochondrial DNA damage increase prostate cancer risk . - To determine dietary intake Ï‰-3 fatty acid alters risk prostate cancer . - To determine association variation gene involve ROS detoxification , oxidative stress response , prostate cancer risk . OUTLINE : Probands undergo blood saliva sample collection fatty acid , DNA , polymorphism analysis . Archived blood tissue sample probands previously participate Dr. Shannon 's Diet Prostate Cancer Risk study also analyze . First-degree relative ( FDRs ) probands found part homogenous high-risk subgroup undergo saliva sample collection DNA analyse . Medical record probands reviewed demographic , history course disease , clinical laboratory test result . All probands FDRs complete `` Genetic Risk Easy Assessment Tool Family History Cancer '' `` Diet History Environmental Risk Factor '' questionnaires baseline . If proband previously participate Diet Prostate Cancer Risk study , ask complete `` Changes Diet , Prescriptions , Supplementals Herbal Remedies '' questionnaire addition `` Genetic Risk Easy Assessment Tool Family History Cancer '' questionnaire baseline study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,250 participant ( 750 probands 1,500 first-degree relative ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
