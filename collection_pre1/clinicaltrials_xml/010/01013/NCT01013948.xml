	<brief_title>Prevalence Chronic Airway Obstruction Subjects With History Cigarette Smoking Primary Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence COPD increase throughout world , vast majority patient disease remain undiagnosed ( Coultas et al. , 2001 ) underreported ( Frank et al. , 2006 ; Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [ GOLD ] , 2003 ; Peña et al. , 2000 ; Takahashi et al. , 2003 ; Van Weel et al. , 2002 ) . This highlight recent study find 63 % patient smoke history spirometry-confirmed COPD mention COPD medical record ( Frank et al. , 2006 ) . These finding indicative low awareness condition among patient COPD ( Stratelis et al. , 2004 ) . The use patient-completed questionnaire ass smoke history status , respiratory symptom , socioeconomic status reliable valid method screen COPD diagnosis severity ( Bednarek et al. , 2008 ) . The range condition describe COPD lead confusion disease terminology difficulty diagnosis communication , particularly primary care ( Fukuhara et al. , 2005 ; Kesten Chapman , 1993 ) . Considering approximately 80 % patient diagnose COPD current previous cigarette smoker , mass screening population use office-based spirometry become attractive option ( Furguson et al. , 2000 ) . A questionnaire design capture patient answer specific disease condition could provide invaluable information , , correlate adequately spirometry , could markedly improve diagnosis provide avenue appropriate treatment decision . There data support argument prevalence physician-diagnosed COPD much low prevalence suggest result population-based spirometric survey ( Chapman , 2004 ; Fukuchi et al. , 2004 ; Peña et al. , 2000 ; Soriano et al. , 2000 ) . Evidently , development practical reliable tool could help bridge gaps diagnosis disease awareness . Moreover , prevalence study underscore need improve awareness COPD among cigarette-smoking population provide information could potentially lead patient seek treatment . Hence , need develop screen questionnaire able identify patient risk airflow obstruction , evaluation . The LFQ , develop purpose , consist series question pertain COPD risk factor symptom . Specifically , study aim identify patient risk airflow obstruction identify LFQ , result follow confirmation subsequent spirometry subset subject . The LFQ evaluate spirometry result comparatively . A minimum age limit 30 year select subject participation study validation LFQ ascertain enrollment adequately representative subset subject may bronchitic asymptomatic COPD , comparison purpose subject COPD . The study subject population may increase sensitivity COPD diagnosis potentially provide information could improve disease awareness , consequence , possibly lead optimization disease management primary care . This cross-sectional study determine prevalence symptomatic airway obstruction use LFQ screen tool primary care patient history cigarette smoke provide descriptive data patient population . The study design multicenter , cross-sectional , involve single visit . This study intend evaluate efficacy safety investigational product . Following completion write informed consent , eligible study subject complete single study visit encompass require study assessment . Study subject receive blind study medication evaluation efficacy safety . All eligible patient complete self-administered Web survey include LFQ . To meet primary secondary aim , patient LFQ ≤ 18 ( current cut-off obstruction ) , well 5 % patient score &gt; 18 , candidate spirometric assessment . Only subset patient undergo pulmonary function test . Albuterol self-administered determination post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume one-second ( FEV1 ) /forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio post-bronchodilator FEV1 percentage predict normal . The study end 800 patient assess spirometrically 3,000 patient complete LFQ ( whichever criterion achieve first ) .

	<criteria>Patients age 30 year old Current previous cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke ≥ 10 packyears : number pack year = ( number cigarette per day/20 ) × number year smoke ) ( e.g. , 10 packyears equal 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ) . Previous smoker define stop smoke least 3 month prior study visit . Willing able provide write informed consent prior study participation ( day study visit ) . Able read , write , comprehend information English . Prior enrollment , prospective subject screen .
