	<brief_title>Lapatinib Combination With Vinorelbine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 105 subject enrol study randomize 2:1 one follow regimen Arm A ( n=70 ) : Lapatinib 1250 mg orally daily continuously plus Vinorelbine 20mg/m2 intravenously ( IV ) day 1 8 , every third week , Arm B ( n=35 ) : Lapatinib 1250 mg orally daily ( QD ) continuously plus Capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/day orally 2 dos 12 hour apart day 1-14 every third week . Randomization stratify accord follow variable : 1 ) Prior receipt therapy metastatic breast cancer ( Yes No ) , 2 ) Site metastatic disease ( Visceral/Soft tissue Bone-only ) . Subjects receive randomize study treatment disease progression discontinuation study treatment due unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , lose follow , death . All subject discontinue study treatment without documented progression continue follow progression accord protocol-schedule new anti-cancer therapy initiate and/or progression death document . Survival data collect subject ensure minimum 18 month survival data . This study include safety run-in phase approximately first 30 subject ( 20 randomize lapatinib vinorelbine ; 10 lapatinib capecitabine ) .</detailed_description>
