	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving bevacizumab together temozolomide radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give bevacizumab together temozolomide external beam radiation therapy work give first-line therapy treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Temozolomide , External Beam Radiation Therapy First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To investigate safety tolerability bevacizumab combination temozolomide external beam fractionate regional radiotherapy first-line treatment patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma . ( Pilot phase ) - To estimate overall survival patient treat regimen . ( Expansion phase ) Secondary - To investigate safety tolerability regimen patient . ( Expansion phase ) - To isolate DNA , RNA , protein frozen paraffin-embedded archival tumor sample evaluation , immunohistochemical pathway profile VEGF-dependent angiogenic pathway , gene expression microarray , MGMT promoter methylation status define important molecular feature treatment response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo external beam fractionate regional radiotherapy daily 5 day week 6 week receive concurrent oral temozolomide daily 6 week . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 2 week begin first day radiotherapy continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 2-5 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive oral temozolomide day 1-5 . Treatment temozolomide repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood frozen paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sample collect biomarker genetic analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
