	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II-R/III trial study gemcitabine hydrochloride without erlotinib hydrochloride follow chemotherapy regimen without radiation therapy capecitabine fluorouracil treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , capecitabine , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy together without erlotinib hydrochloride and/or radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether chemotherapy effective give without erlotinib hydrochloride and/or radiation therapy treat pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without Erlotinib Hydrochloride Followed By Same Chemotherapy Regimen With Without Radiation Therapy Capecitabine Fluorouracil Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) adjuvant chemotherapy show signal improve survival compare gemcitabine alone follow R0 R1 resection head pancreas adenocarcinoma ( include adenocarcinoma head , neck , uncinate process ) . ( Phase II-R ) II . To determine whether use concurrent fluoropyrimidine radiotherapy follow adjuvant gemcitabine base chemotherapy non-gemcitabine base chemotherapy modify fluorouracil-leucovorin-irinotecan-oxaliplatin regimen ( FOLFIRINOX ) enhance survival patient without evidence progressive disease 5 month adjuvant chemotherapy . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate disease-free survival adjuvant chemotherapy follow radiotherapy concurrent fluoropyrimidine patient resect head pancreas adenocarcinoma disease free 5 month adjuvant chemotherapy . II . To evaluate disease-free survival standard adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy without erlotinib patient resect head pancreas adenocarcinoma . III . To evaluate adverse event without erlotinib patient resect head pancreas adenocarcinoma . IV . To evaluate adverse event adjuvant chemotherapy without radiation therapy concurrent fluoropyrimidine patient resect head pancreas adenocarcinoma disease free adjuvant chemotherapy . V. To evaluate preoperative cross-sectional imaging primary head pancreas adenocarcinoma order determine frequency objective criterion resectability present . VI . To determine patient report low baseline fatigue , measure Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy ( FACIT ) -Fatigue , predict survival explore correlation baseline fatigue , measure Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) , survival . OUTLINE : Patients without disease progression treatment arm I II randomize 1 2 additional treatment arm ( arm III IV ) . ARM I : Patients receive either gemcitabine hydrochloride allowable combination chemotherapy per standard care 5 month . ARM II ( close accrual 4/2/14 ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive treatment arm I 1 month . ARM IV : Patients receive treatment arm I 1 month . Beginning within 7-21 day completion chemotherapy , patient undergo radiotherapy ( 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy ) 5 day per week 5.5 week ( 28 fraction ) . During radiotherapy , patient receive either capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) 5 day per week fluorouracil IV continuously 5.5 week radiotherapy complete . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
