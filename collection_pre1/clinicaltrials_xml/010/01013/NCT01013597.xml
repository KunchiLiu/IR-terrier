	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate tumor response rate patient metastatic medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) radioiodine resistant differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) receive treatment LBH589 20 mg mouth , three time weekly . Time progression , overall survival , toxicity , tolerability , Notch1 protein expression pattern also evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial LBH589 Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) neuroendocrine tumor account 3-5 % case thyroid cancer . The majority patient MTC present early stage disease . Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) account &gt; 90 % thyroid cancer . In sub-set patient , thyroid cell become resistant I-131 radioiodine therapy subsequently develop distant metastasis . In MTC DTC , systemic chemotherapy metastatic disease largely ineffective . LBH589 histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) recently demonstrate activity inhibit Notch1 signal pathway MTC cancer cell suppress tumor cell proliferation DTC cancer cell . This clinical trial evaluate tumor response rate LBH589 patient metastatic MTC radioactive iodine resistant DTC .</detailed_description>
