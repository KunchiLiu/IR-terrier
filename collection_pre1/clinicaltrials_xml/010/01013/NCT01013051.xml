Drug malabsorption potential concern post-gastric bypass intestinal length reduce . Purpose : The purpose control , pharmacokinetic study determine whether absorption single dose metformin , first line drug treatment patient type 2 diabetes , significantly reduce gastric bypass . Methods : A single dose standard release metformin 1000 mg administer patient undergone gastric bypass patient receive surgery wait list ( wait-listed control ) . Blood sample urine sample occur standardized fashion ensue 24 hour measure compare absorption metformin study arm . 34 patient total recruited . Significance : Following completion study , good understand gastric bypass affect metformin absorption . Ultimately , information help ensure patient population receive optimal dos important drug treatment .</brief_summary>
