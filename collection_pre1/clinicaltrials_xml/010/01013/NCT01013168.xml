	<detailed_description>STUDY PURPOSE : The purpose study collect data safety feasibility use medical device OncoSorb® clinical routine treatment patient solid metastatic cancer entity fail standard therapy . MEDICAL DEVICE : The medical device use clinical study OncoSorb® column . It use specially modified Fresenius ART apheresis machine , associate tube set Albuflow plasma filter , also Fresenius . These component comprise extracorporeal immune apheresis system . The OncoSorb® column CE certify April 2008 . The OncoSorb® device intend specifically adsorb three soluble receptor ( sTNF-R1 , sTNF-R2 sIL-2R α ) , know inhibit natural immune response cancer patient mediate via tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF- α ) . OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : The primary objective evaluate use OncoSorb® therapy clinical practice term safety feasibility . This involve evaluation system-immanent issue ( particularly occurrence possible catheter infection suitability citrate/heparin anticoagulation ) course clinical study prior initiation phase II study . Primary variable : Occurrence - Possible catheter infection - Suitability citrate/heparin anticoagulation ( clog extracorporeal circuit bleed potential consequence ) - Adverse events/serious adverse event general include change clinically relevant laboratory parameter , change vital sign , ECG change ) Secondary objective Evaluation clinical efficacy define objective response treatment ( accord RECIST ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , clinical benefit , quality life ( QoL ) kinetics soluble receptor . Secondary variable : - Objective response rate ( ORR ) OncoSorb® therapy , define proportion patient confirm CR PR accord RECIST efficacy evaluation I , II III ( monthly Cycles 2 , 4 6 continuation disease progression ) - Progression free survival ( PFS ) - Time progression ( TTP ) - Clinical benefit OncoSorb® therapy ( defined proportion patient confirm CR , PR stable disease [ SD ] ) evaluable patient population - QoL ( assess EORTC QLQ-C30 rev . 3.0 ) - Kinetics sTNF-R1 , sTNF-R2 sIL-2R α ( concentration level pre-/post-apheresis well determination receptor level treatment ) . Soluble receptor level measure first 3 recruited patient day 4 5 ( hourly first 3 hour , every 2 hour follow 6 hour every 3 hour treatment start day 5 ) . STUDY POPULATION : A total 5 evaluable patient recruit , age 18 old . Eligible patient identify NCT , Department Medical Oncology Department Dermatology ( Prof. Enk ) . Patient 5 patient cutaneous metastatic melanoma . One tumor lesion biopsied ( tumor excision ) order evaluate induction apoptosis trigger TNF-α . The stag examination accord RECIST criterion conduct radiological department University Heidelberg . Patients receive central venous catheter extracorporeal treatment site Prof. Quentmeyer ( St. Josefskrankenhaus , Heidelberg ) . The OncoSorb® treatment patient OncoSorb® extracorporeal immune apheresis device conduct either site Prof. Rohmeiss ( ze : ro dialysis center Schwetzingen ) site Prof. Zeier ( Nierenzentrum Heidelberg ) . For security reason recruitment patient consecutive order patient 1 2 : Patient 2 recruited case patient 1 finalize OncoSorb treatment end cycle 2 . For recruitment subsequent patient ( patient 3 5 ) , consecutive recruitment plan . Patient 5 optionally receive another biopsy ( tumor excision ) day 5 week 3 second treatment cycle evaluate biological effect OncoSorb treatment respect induction apoptosis response TNF-α . STUDY TREATMENTS : The study start screen visit ( day -21 day 0 ) obtain informed consent patient . Patients screen recruitment patient 5 must give consent baseline biopsy ( tumor excision ) optional follow-up biopsy ( end week 3 cycle 2 ; tumor excision ) . Patients , qualify participation willing participate , receive period central venous catheter conduction extracorporeal OncoSorb® therapy . During treatment period patient receive OncoSorb® treatment consist daily immune adsorption treatment procedures 5 day per week 3 week , follow resting period one week . Due safety reason patient hospitalize NCT first week OncoSorb® treatment . Since currently information exist counterregulation kinetics sTNF-R1 , sTNF-R2 sIL-2Rα upon OnsoSorb® treatment , collection pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data plan first 3 recruited patient . Blood sample PK measurement patient take day 4 5 first treatment cycle hospitalize condition . PK data essential design optimized treatment schedule ( potential reduction frequency apheresis time ) subsequent patient trial . The schedule first 3 patient constitute one monthly treatment cycle . For 2 remain patient study treatment plan re-designed accord PK data obtain first 3 patient treatment . The efficacy evaluation carry 8 week begin treatment . Patients progression disease may withdraw OncoSorb® treatment . Patients complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) offer continue OncoSorb® treatment disease progression . In case efficacy evaluation ( CT scan ) perform every 8 week .</detailed_description>
