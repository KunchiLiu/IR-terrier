	<brief_summary>Through study , investigator prove Cilostazol effectively prevent cardiovascular event ischemic stroke patient high risk cerebral hemorrhage , along significant increase risk occurrence hemorrhagic side effect . The primary hypothesis study ; Cilostazol alone probucol reduce risk cerebral hemorrhage without increase cardiovascular event compare aspirin ischemic stroke patient symptomatic asymptomatic old cerebral hemorrhage . This study prove superiority cilostazol prevention cerebral hemorrhagic event without increase cardiovascular event aspirin superiority probucol prevention overall cardiovascular event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It generally accept 'old age ' 'hypertension ' may risk factor cerebral infarction also cerebral hemorrhage . Usually 40 60 percent recurrent stroke cerebral hemorrhage case cerebral infarction ; 5 10 percent recurrent stroke cerebral infarction case cerebral hemorrhage . Consequently , reason describe , hemorrhagic side effect include cerebral hemorrhage great concern , usage antiplatelet agent anticoagulant secondary prevention patient cerebral infarction . It report occurrence cerebral hemorrhage tend increase case accompany lacunar infarction occur frequently Asians Westerners , periventricular ischemic change increasingly occur age . Accordingly , point occurrence cerebral hemorrhage primarily consider treatment cerebral infarction , along phenomenon age population Asian country include Korea . Nevertheless , far clinical research regard secondary prevention stroke , particularly consider risk occurrence hemorrhage cerebral infarction case . However , accord recent study , phosphodiesterase inhibitor include Cilostazol use independently , combination aspirin , secondary prevention improve without increase occurrence hemorrhagic side effect . Considering , prove agent , Cilostazol , could decrease risk occurrence stoke , along significant increase risk occurrence hemorrhagic side effect , select patent group high risk cerebral hemorrhage , agent ( Cilostazol ) may recognize unique antiplatelet agent applicable old-aged patient cerebral infarction certain risk cerebral hemorrhage . - High risk cerebral hemorrhage define presence history cerebral hemorrhage appropriate neuroimage finding presence asymptomatic old cerebral hemorrhage finding ( equal 8mm ) multiple microbleeds GRE image . - 1600 ischemic stroke patient high risk cerebral hemorrhage recruit randomized four group ( cilostazol plus probucol , aspirin plus probucol , cilostazol aspirin ) 2X2 factorial design . - IMT ABI measure every year follow-up period result compare baseline data . The change IMT ABI analyze occurrence cardiovascular event . - The study finish least 1 year recruit 1600th patient . Until finish , patient continuously take study medication visit every 3months study site . - Brain MRI include FLAIR GRE do final visit .</detailed_description>
