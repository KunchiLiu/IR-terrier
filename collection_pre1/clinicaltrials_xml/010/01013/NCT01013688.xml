All patient schedule follow discharge 3rd , 6th 12th postoperative month . Standard 12-lead electrocardiography ( ECG ) , 24-hour Holter transthoracic echocardiography use determine rhythm cardiac hemodynamic status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether concomitant radiofrequency Maze procedure surgical treatment chronic atrial fibrillation rheumatic valve disease could provide good sinus rhythm control , improve cardiac hemodynamic status decrease thromboembolism event compare biatrial good leave atrial procedure ? 150 patient chronic AF concomitant cardiac surgery enrol . Patients underwent bi-atrial radiofrequency , leave atrial radiofrequency radiofrequency procedure randomly . All patient receipt amiodarone 200 mg/day 12 month postoperatively . All patient schedule follow discharge 3rd , 6th 12th postoperative months.The follow diagnostic procedure perform 1 . Standard 12-lead electrocardiography 2 . Holter-ECG 3 . Transthoracic echocardiography</detailed_description>
