	<brief_summary>The purpose study improve ability diagnose problem mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) test drug may improve outcome injury . Of 1.5 million people experience traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) year United States , many 75 % sustain mild TBI cause long-term permanent impairments/disabilities significant proportion patient . In addition , traumatic brain injury become signature injury war Iraq Afghanistan . For people injury , difficult determine whether symptom due head injury another condition , Post-traumatic Stress Disorder . In project , 3 observational study involve test mental function behavior , image brain special x-ray procedure , blood sample look glandular function , may affect head injury . A fourth study test drug , atorvastatin , may provide protection injured brain cell improve outcome . By collect analyze information test , possible make process diagnose mild TBI post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) precise , also see atorvastatin helpful drug patient MTBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Of 1.5 million people experience traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) year United States , many 75 % sustain mild TBI ( MTBI ) cause long-term permanent impairments/disabilities significant proportion patient . In addition , traumatic brain injury become signature injury war Iraq Afghanistan . One difficult diagnostic problem separate effect MTBI post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , sign symptoms condition often overlap . Early accurate diagnosis MTBI differentiation acute stress disorder ( ASD ) PTSD major priority military medicine due overlap symptom ( e.g. , attention problem ) frequent lack external sign even self-awareness MTBI , especially association blast injury . The major goal project improve ability diagnose mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) test drug , atorvastatin , may improve outcome MTBI . To accomplish goal , 200 MTBI subject 100 orthopedic injury ( OI ) subject , comparison purpose , recruit variety clinical evaluation phase II drug trial . Only MTBI subject participate phase II drug trial , subject may choose participate observational study , decline drug trial . Potential subject identify Emergency Departments ( EDs ) two level I trauma center , locate within block Houston , Texas . Once discharged ED , subject enrolled baseline procedure perform , include behavioral/cognitive testing , sample collection , medication teaching , include first dose study drug . Subjects follow phone Day 3-4 7-day dose period drug trial , return visit subject one week , one month , three month , six month injury . Investigation acute civilian MTBI could potentially elucidate diagnostic issue distinguish MTBI , post-concussion syndrome ( PCS ) , acute stress disorder ( ASD ) , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , civilian setting , mild traumatic brain injury characterize prospectively use advanced brain imaging , EEG , neuropsychological assessment . We hypothesize comparison OI subject , MTBI group exhibit slow EEG frequency , alteration cerebral white matter microstructure diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , cognitive deficit within 24 hour injury . We also hypothesize MTBI subject show recovery EEG frequency cognition six month follow injury despite residual white matter injury DTI . We also collect two plasma sample saliva sample , first within 24 hr injury ( baseline ) second six month post-injury , measurement potential biomarkers genetic study . Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) use detect characterize focal abnormality neurophysiological function subject MTBI diagnose PTSD purpose distinguish two . MEG completely non-invasive image modality able provide information regard focal abnormality brain . MEG show sensitive cognitive complaint patient MTBI sensitive deficit EEG . In addition , neurophysiological abnormality find test differentiate patient MTBI PTSD study . Thus , propose explore relationship DTI MEG finding may lead identification distinct , replicable pattern brain abnormality subject PTSD MTBI may lead good differentiation group patient improve diagnostic precision , well patient combination disorder . A separate analysis design examine incidence effect hypopituitarism MTBI . The incidence hypopituitarism MTBI known . However , patient persistent symptom one year post-injury , 35 % find deficiency one pituitary hormone . The clinical characteristic , MRI image result , EEG MEG result patient pituitary deficiency compare patient normal pituitary function . The relationship pituitary dysfunction functional outcome , cognitive recovery , resolution PCS examine well . The final component protocol Phase II randomize clinical trial 200 MTBI subject evaluate atorvastatin ( LipitorÂ® ) neuroprotective agent treatment MTBI . The primary endpoint trial three month . This trial examine effect atorvastatin , give orally dose 1mg/kg ( 80 mg ) seven day , development post-concussive symptom ( PCS ) , PTSD symptom , cognitive recovery , functional outcome 3 month post-injury , recovery EEG MEG 3 month post-injury , change DTI imaging , well effect liver function . In conclusion , traumatic brain injury become signature injury Iraq Afghanistan war , many veteran mild TBI find injury overlook misunderstood . The goal Mission Connect Mild TBI Translational Research Consortium find answer challenge question associate diagnosis treatment MTBI . The four study Integrated Clinical Protocol begin process .</detailed_description>
