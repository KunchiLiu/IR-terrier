	<brief_summary>The present study constitutes study examine effect atorvastatin vascular function high cardiovascular risk patient . For purpose investigator record atorvastatin effect statin-naïve patient ( patient start statin treatment first time ) . More specifically investigator study atorvastatin effect : 1 . Endothelial function 2 . Arterial elastic property 3 . Systemic Inflammatory/thrombotic mechanisms 4 . Vascular myocardial redox state</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pleiotropic Effects Atorvastatin High Cardiovascular Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In total recruit 72 high cardiovascular risk patient patient ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ischemic heart failure ) , coronary artery disease and/or patient undergo elective coronary bypass artery grafting ( CABG ) , valve replacement aortic surgery . The whole study divide 2 distinct clinical arm : ARM A In arm patient ischemic heart failure ( NYHA II-III ) recruit . In double-blind crossover design heart failure patient ( n=30 ) naïve statins treatment randomize atorvastatin 10mg/day ( n=15 ) 40mg/day ( n=15 ) 4 week . At end 4 week 2-week wash period follow patient switch atorvastatin dose ( e.g patient atorvastatin 10mg/day switch 40mg/day vice versa ) . Both baseline end 4 week period patient undergo - blood sample - assessment endothelium-dependent -independent vasodilatation - vascular elastic property study ( see method ) . ARM B In arm , patient undergo cardiac surgery ( CABG , valve replacement aortic surgery ) statins treatment recruit ( n=42 ) . Patients randomize double-blind fashion atorvastatin 40mg/day placebo 3 day surgery . Both baseline surgery day patient undergo - blood sample - assessment endothelium-dependent -independent vasodilatation ( see method ) - surgery tissue sample ( graft , myocardium adipose tissue segment ) obtain use ex-vivo study ( see ) . Consent form Every patient participate clinical study give write consent form , inform detail aim study researcher . During recruitment process participant fill questionnaire demographic clinical data . All information give participant hold highly classify . All participant give write consent program biochemical measurement vascular study , state study design . Specifically patient undergo cardiac surgery ( arm B ) additional consent form fill permit graft , myocardium adipose tissue segment harvest cardiac surgery . Methods Endothelial-dependent independent vasodilatation : Brachial Artery Flow-Mediated Dilatation ( FMD ) brachial artery measure quantitative readout NO-mediated conduit vessel endothelial function , do several previous study accordance international guidelines.Endothelial dependent ( hyperaemic flow cuff occlusion ) endothelial independent ( GTN ) responses brachial artery measure use high-resolution ultrasound image automated vessel diameter measurement ( Vascular Analyser , MIA Inc. Iowa ) . FMD GTN induce dilatation measure absolute proportional change arterial diameter.Reproducibility data laboratory show coefficient variation inter-study measurement &lt; 10 % comparable report . Arterial Stiffness : Measures central arterial stiffness independent predictor cardiovascular outcome large prospective study inversely correlate measure endothelial function.Arterial tonometry simple , reproducible method measure , non-invasively , arterial stiffness . We already establish measure central aortic stiffness - augmentation index aortic pulse wave velocity - use Sphygmocor system applanation tonometry ( AtCor Medical , Australia ) . Mathematical transformation radial pulse waveform use derive augmentation index.The difference time pulse waveform reach carotid compare femoral artery measure pulse wave velocity aorta , fast transit associate 'stiffer ' aorta . Systemic oxidative stress : We study statin effect systemic oxidative stress use systemic oxidative stress marker like lipid peroxide . In detail lipid peroxide quantify patient ' plasma use malondialdehyde assay ( ΜDA-TBARS ) . Vascular oxidative stress : ROS generation vascular segment obtain CABG determine lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence . The measurement also perform myocardium segment obtain CABG form site right atrium incision , extracorporeal circulation cannula insert . Our aim determine statin effect vascular myocardial ROS generation . Adipose tissue culture : During cardiac surgery adipose tissue sample collect . In detail subcutaneous adipose tissue collect site sternum incision ; pericardial adipose tissue collect site close right ventricle ; femoral adipose tissue collect area saphenous vein harvesting ( available ) . Adipose tissue sample obtain surgery cultured ex-vivo use standard adipose tissue protocol . Biochemical inflammatory marker : Apart common laboratory screening test ( whole blood count , AST , ALT , γGT , ALP , Urea , Creatinine , glucose , total cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL , HDL , Na+ , K+ , Ca2+ , CRP ) , determine additional proinflammatory prothrombotic biomarkers patient ' plasma . More specifically , use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) quantify interleukin-6 adipokines patient plasma adipose tissue culture supernatant . Using high precision liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) quantify biopterin plasma vascular level ( tetrahydrobiopterin , dihydrobiopterin total biopterins ) .Studies show abovementioned marker may prognostic value high cardiovascular risk patient . Statistical Analysis : Statistical analysis result do separately accord clinical group study . Therefore separate statistical analysis ischemic heart failure patient group ( arm A ) patient undergo cardiac surgery ( arm B ) . Especially arm B compare reactive oxygen specie generation vascular wall myocardium patient randomize placebo atorvastatin 40mg/day .</detailed_description>
