	<brief_title>The Use Music Pain Anxiety Control During Abortion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly 90 % abortion occur first trimester majority perform suction curettage outpatient set use local anesthesia ( Grimes , 2007; Lichtenberg , 2001 ) . When local anesthesia use , 97 % woman experience pain , anxiety level positive predictor pain abortion ( Bélanger , 1989 ) . Although general anesthesia offer well agent anxiety pain management , route less commonly use prohibitive cost potential complication ( Grimes , 2007 ) . Because many first trimester abortion provider utilize local anesthesia primary pain management procedure , multiple agent technique investigate supplement enhance effect local anesthetic . Investigated method include time delay paracervical block administration cervical dilation , intrauterine lidocaine infusion , various combination inhale , oral , intravenous analgesic anxiolytic . Additionally , complementary alternative regimen relaxation , distraction , hypnosis , aromatherapy also evaluate auxiliary analgesic anxiolytic first trim abortion . Despite attempt improve anxiety pain associate abortion local anesthesia , result efficacy method variable inconsistent . Music therapy classify cognitive-behavioral intervention help patient provide great sense self-control assess manage pain ( AHCPR , 1992 ) . In 1992 , recommendation Agency Healthcare Research Quality include music one type cognitive-behavioral intervention pain management ( AHCPR , 1992 ) . The exact mechanism music impact pain sensory system fully elucidate , think engage specific brain function involve memory , learning , multiple motivational emotional state ( Nilsson , 2008 ) . As influential theory nature pain , Gate Control Theory hypothesize cognitive-behavioral intervention work close gate nerve fiber transmit ascend sensory information brain concurrently modulate input inhibitory system psychological factor , sum lead reduction pain experience ( Tse , 2005; Sendelbach , 2006 ) . The Gate Control Theory posit music act distracter , divert attention away noxious stimulus redirect person 's attention involve individual distract task ( Tse , 2005 ) . The role music auxiliary analgesic anxiolytic evaluate outpatient procedure colonoscopy , laceration repair , dental work , lithotripsy , nasal surgery , breast biopsy , colposcopy ( Chan , 2003 ) . In addition nonpharmacologic approach pain management relaxation , distraction , guide imagery , musical intervention demonstrate favorable effect upon pain , anxiety , wound healing , recovery among patient peri-operative setting ( Laurion , 2003 ) . Physiological parameter heart rate , blood pressure , stress hormone level improve influence music ( Leardi , 2007 ) . A Cochrane Collaboration review use music pain relief find music reduce pain intensity level recommend music use primary pain control ( Cepeda , 2006 ) . The author also conclude impact music anxiety yet determine need investigate . Given music 's demonstrated benefit auxiliary analgesic anxiolytic multiple operative setting , role abortion set deserves examination . The objective study evaluate role music alternative agent pain anxiety management first trim abortion . A systematic review 42 randomize control trial evaluate effect music multiple peri-operative setting find intervention positive effect reduce patient pain anxiety approximately half review study ( Nilsson , 2008 ) . Many include trial note `` insufficient quality '' meta-analysis could perform due variation type music use , duration listening time , procedure investigate . Furthermore , study use non-validated questionnaire methodological limitation . Nonetheless , author conclude peri-operative musical intervention easy implement effective reduce patient pain , anxiety , stress ( Nilsson , 2008 ) . A 2006 Cochrane Collaboration review examine effect music acute chronic pain 51 randomize control trial . They calculate mean difference pain intensity level , percentage patient least 50 % pain relief , opioid requirement among 3663 subject . The author conclude listen music reduce pain intensity level opioid requirement magnitude benefit small uncertain clinical significance ( Cepeda , 2006 ) . Although pooled result indicate statistical significance reduction post-operative pain intensity level , author state role music pain relief warrant investigation role potential anxiolytic . As musical intervention show adverse effect , worth pursue nonpharmacologic agent supplemental resource patient undergo medical procedure first trim abortion . Only one study , publish 1975 , examine music auxiliary analgesic first trimester abortion . This randomize controlled trial 144 patient divide 3 group receive oral diazepam paracervical block mepivacaine addition 1 ) anesthesia , 2 ) self-administered methoxyflurane , 3 ) music via stereophonic headphone . Patients listen music suction curettage report less tension less pain ( Shapiro , 1975 ) . Although study show beneficial effect music , finding limit poor study descriptor patient characteristic , unspecified randomization procedure , lack appropriate statistical analysis . A non-validated pain questionnaire utilized minimal description procedural method , intervention , result . Given limitation , result may applicable current randomize trial guideline . Nonetheless , publish study examine use music auxiliary analgesic first trimester abortion . Because pain perception also think highly associate comorbid condition depression , anxiety , substance abuse , pain experience may influence overall satisfaction outcomes relate specific event ( Guzeldemir , 2008; Bair , 2007 ) . The baseline presence condition may impact one 's response pain management , anxiety status , satisfaction associate procedure . In addition overall satisfaction , assess comorbid condition study . Today , music become portable form digital music player iPOD™ . With 25 % Americans 51 % American adolescent own one device , music familiar part many life ( Pew , 2006 ) . Pain study evaluate musical intervention auxiliary analgesia use various type music via different delivery system ( i.e . cassette/CD player headphone , loudspeaker , live music music therapist ) different setting . Many trial utilized self-selection music include variety musical genre , specific sound , white noise , vocal suggestion . Although study indicate slow non-lyrical music patient 's choice least 30 minute 60 decibel volume ideal optimal pain relief relaxation , know factor directly influence music 's impact reduce pain anxiety ( Nilsson , 2008 ) . Additionally , mixed evidence role patient choice music selection whether affect amount pain anxiety experience . While study advocate use self-selected music enhance pain anxiety reduction ( Hekmat , 1993; Lee , 2004 ) , previously mention Cochrane review find decline pain intensity similar among patient whether music self-selected ( Cepeda , 2006 ) . Given data music 's potential ability positively influence surgical experience , believe music auxiliary method anxiety pain management first trim abortion warrant investigation . The propose study evaluate music 's impact anxiety pain experience first trimester abortion perform local anesthesia might influence overall satisfaction experience procedure . Given 50 % woman abortion 2005 less 25 year old ( Gamble , 2008 ) young age group likely increase familiarity portable digital music player , patient population may benefit music auxiliary analgesic anxiolytic pregnancy termination . This research potential expand arsenal low-cost , safe , effective analgesic anxiolytic available surgical abortion , commonly perform procedure across United States worldwide . The addition music first trim abortion local anesthesia provide opportunity improve pain anxiety associate procedure , especially give many woman reproductive age utilize personal digital music player may welcome auxiliary analgesic anxiolytic experience . The propose study randomize control trial evaluate hypothesis intraoperative music reduce patient anxiety pain first trim abortion . We examine role music auxiliary analgesic anxiolytic conjunction standard pain control regimen use first trim suction aspiration procedure consist preoperative oral ibuprofen local anesthesia use 1 % lidocaine paracervical block . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio control intervention group .</detailed_description>
