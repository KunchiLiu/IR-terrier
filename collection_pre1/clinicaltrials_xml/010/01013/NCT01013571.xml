	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The primary objective study demonstrate non-inferiority patient-managed titration algorithm ( include blood glucose monitoring ) addition single dose insulin glulisine breakfast Canadian patient inadequately control T2DM optimization basal insulin , compare HCP-managed titration algorithm . The primary endpoint assessment objective percent patient reach target HbA1c &lt; =7.0 % without severe hypoglycemia end study . Secondary Objective : Secondary objective study compare effect two different insulin glulisine titration algorithm ( patient-managed versus HCP-managed ) following : - change HbA1c , FG , 7-point glucose profile Week 24 Week 36 - satisfaction treatment ( DTSQc patient questionnaire HCP ) Week 36 - change weight Week 24 Week 36 - incidence hypoglycemia - insulin dose - resource utilization ( rural/urban , blood glucose meter test strip , lancet , HCP visit , telephone call , hospitalization ) - adherence patient-managed monitoring algorithm</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Runin phase : T2DM Treated least 3 month basal insulin ( insulin glargine , NPH , detemir ) +/ oral antidiabetic drug ( OADs ) HbA1c &gt; 7.0 % insulin naive ( 23 OADs ) HbA1c &gt; =7.8 % ( historic HbA1c result 3 month screen acceptable ) Randomized treatment phase : Completed runin phase HbA1c &gt; 7.0 % &gt; = 1 episode confirm nocturnal hypoglycemia ( BG &lt; 4.0 mmol/L ) &gt; = 2 measurement FG &lt; =6.0 mmol/L within previous week Patients complete runin phase HbA1c &gt; 7.0 % meet randomization criterion continue titrate insulin glargine follow end study . No food intake lunch ( noon ) Unstable diet intake significant change current diet regimen Nightshift worker Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects unwilling inject insulin perform selfmonitoring blood glucose Pregnant , alcohol drug abuse Active cancer disease condition opinion investigator would make subject unsuitable participation study Any clinical significant laboratory finding judgment investigator would preclude safe completion study Known allergy study drug The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
