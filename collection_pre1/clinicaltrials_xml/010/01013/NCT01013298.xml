	<brief_title>Video-guided Percutaneous Tracheostomy ( PCT ) : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Percutaneous tracheostomy ( PCT ) commonly use intensive care unit ( ICU ) critically-ill patient require long-term mechanical ventilation . In experienced hand , proper patient selection , safe , easy quick , associate perioperative complication rate reduce approximately 4 % [ 1-7 ] . However , skilled intensivist may always available , procedure may sometimes entail complication . These include paratracheal insertion tracheostomy tube , tracheal injury ; puncture cuff transfix endotracheal tube ( ETT ) transtracheal needle insertion ; insert guide wire Murphy 's eye ; accidental extubation withdraw endotracheal tube procedure leading loss airway [ 8-13 ] . Although use fingertip palpate trachea endotracheal tube useful technique locate tip endotracheal tube procedure , unreliable , particularly patient short thick neck . Bronchoscopic guidance PCT generally recommend minimize risk unintentional tracheal injury . The use fibreoptic bronchoscope may helpful [ 14-18 ] . However , expensive tool readily available center . Video guidance provide cost-effective alternative bronchoscope , may also reduce risk procedure-related complication paratracheal insertion tracheostomy tube , tracheal injury cuff puncture [ 19 ] . The goal study observe describe simple safe technique - Video-guided PCT - may overcome limitation percutaneous tracheostomy , report potentially-related complication may occur procedure , portray learn curve obtain technique . The equipment use technique ETView TVTTM , commercially available ETT , embed mini video-camera tip tube . It provide direct endoscopic visualization larynx tracheal mucosa , thereafter allow determination tip transtracheal needle percutaneous puncture trachea , hence may reduce likelihood paratracheal insertion , tracheal injury , technical complication . The ETView TVTTM device compatible medical grade NTSC video monitor , thereby provide monitoring airway intubation PCT procedure , well continuous view airway long mechanical ventilation require ( www.etview.com ) . Study Objectives To observe new bedside technique video-guided PCT , report potentially-related complication , construct learn curve base operative time complication rate . Study design The study conduct prospective observational one . The set ICU Sourasky medical center . 10 consecutive adult critically ill patient require elective tracheostomy recruit study . Informed consent obtain family next kin study patient . In absence relative , consent give anesthesiologist/intensivist related study . The procedure perform team intensivists upon study patient . During follow procedure assess complication rate , operative time , operability procedure ( see `` procedure &amp; follow-up '' section ) . Methods The procedure The procedure perform ICU team include : anesthesiologist/intensivist execute procedure , another anesthesiologist apply anesthetic &amp; analgesia , nurse , forth person take time . During procedure oxygen saturation , end tidal carbon dioxide ( ETCO2 ) , ECG , blood pressure , arterial blood gas monitor continuously . The video-guided PCT procedure require extubation re-intubation TVTTM tube , mention consent form . Re-intubation TVTTM tube perform commonly practice intubation . The ETView Tracheoscopic system ( TVTTM ) consist ETT , embed video image device light source tip integrate cable connector , may wire video monitor . The imaging system use monitor airways intubating , beyond vocal cord , locate transtracheal insertion site needle . In addition , light source serve transillumination neck soft tissue , order delineate tracheal curvature identify anatomical deviation . Anesthesia analgesia routinely perform , standardize study patient . Low dos opiate fentanyl ( 2-3 μg/kg ) short-acting sedative propofol ( 20 mg bolus , 3-6mg/kg/h drip ) administer begin procedure . Rocuronium bromide , brief acting muscle paralyzer , 0.6mg/kg , also use patient . Patient follow-up The execute physician answer questionnaire evaluate intraprocedural difficulty , complication , feasibility , confidence , operability , follow-up patient first 6h procedure , discharge . Follow-up include documentation procedure-related complication , monitor respiratory/ventilatory parameter length stay ( LOS ) ICU beyond 6h ( due medical circumstance related procedure ) . All study patient place arterial line withdraw blood procedure , indicated deterioration respiratory parameter - blood gas analysis ( PaO2/FiO2 , PaCO2 , pH BE ) . In addition , saturation document hourly . All patient also chest x-ray perform immediately follow tracheostomy . The questionnaire include check-list listing procedure-related complication , evaluate total number complication . These include : A . Technical complication : False route/paratracheal insertion , injury thoracic vessel , tracheal/laryngeal/esophageal injury , accidental decannulation , puncture cuff , insert guide wire Murphy 's eye , malpositioning kink tracheal cannula , fail trachestomy , multiple puncture ( ≥3 ) . B . Clinical complication potentially related procedure : B.1 . Intraprocedural : significant endotracheal bleed transfusion requirement ( RBC , FFP platelet ) , transient hypoxia/hypoxemia , hemodynamic change ( e.g. , transient hypotension relate anesthetic ) . B.2 . Postprocedure : alteration respiratory function ( define &gt; 15 % reduction saturation PaO2/FiO2 , compare baseline ; Increased PaCO2 without change saturation ; need change ventilatory setting and/or add PEEP within first 24 hr ) , atelectasis , pneumothorax , pneumomediastinum , aspiration , early unexplained mortality ( within first 24 hr ) . Other parameter ask evaluate : whether transtracheal needle recognize via TVTTM ( yes/no ) ; intraoperative difficulty ; level confidence ; ease performance ( `` best practice '' ) ; need convert surgical tracheostomy procedure . In addition , member team measure operative time , include total duration procedure ; time take recognize tracheal insertion site needle ; time since ETT placement successful tracheal placement confirm via air bubble ETCO2 . The complication rate operative time use construct learn curve execute intensivist .</detailed_description>
