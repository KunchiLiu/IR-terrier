	<detailed_description>For proper vision , eye need focus exactly image . The two main determinant refraction focus power cornea eye 's axis length . In normal eye , image form exactly retina ( emmetropia ) , farsightedness ( hyperopia ) situation , eye form image backside retina nearsightedness ( myopia ) situation image form front retina , may two reason : 1 ) lens convexity powerful normal 2 ) eye axis longer normal ( axial myopia ) . Refractive error measure diopter ( D ) , myopia specify negative sign . Severity myopia categorize 3 level . 1 ) Mild ( 0 -1.5D ) , 2 ) moderate ( -1.5D -6.0D ) 3 ) severe myopia ( -6.0D ) . Pathogenic myopia develop , condition advance -8.0 D . Visual disorder - moderate retina disorder , cataract , glaucoma - may see patient moderate severe myopia . At birth , infant hyperopic condition lower grow age 5-8 , eye must emmetropic ( normal without refractive error ) ( 2 ) . Nearsightedness see 30.4 million adult USA ( 1 ) . It 's prevalence adolescent remarkably increase last decade today prevalence industrialize western eastern society increase 10-25 60-80 percent respectively ( 3 ) . For American society , 60 percent myopia categorize early myopia ( childhood/school age ) usually age 9-11 year , increase adolescence year , decrease late adolescence begin 20th decade life , usually stop -3 -4 D ( 9,10 ) . A study Tehran ( 4 ) show prevalence myopia 21.8 56.6 percent base manifest cycloplegic refraction respectively . Another study show high prevalence myopia schoolchildren Kashan , Iran ( 11 ) . Also study Dezful , Iran show prevalence myopia 7-15y 14-18y child 3.4 33 percent respectively ( 12 ) . Factors related myopia divide two group : 1 ) hereditary 2 ) environmental . Relationship heredity likelihood myopia show many study ( 13 , 14 ) . These study obviously show effect parental myopia moderate level childhood myopia . Today different area several chromosome know severe myopia ( like 18p , 12q , 7q36 , TGIF ) ( 15-17 ) . Although seem two chromosome ( 18q , 12q ) relationship childhood myopia ( 18 ) . Environmental factor study show may relation myopia : near work ( 19 , 20 ) , stature ( 21 , 22 ) , night time light exposure ( 10 ) [ however relationship confirm neither American ( 20 ) English child Indian monkey ( 23 , 24 ) ] , day time light exposure ( 25 ) , refine sugar consumption [ It show carbohydrate consumption stimulate series event lead eye 's axial length increase consequently myopia . So refined sugar consumption increase nowadays may play role . ] ( 26 ) , IQ ( Intelligence quotient ) ( 27-33 ) , birth weight , social economic condition ( 7 ) , physical activity ( 32 ) , breastfeed ( 7 ) . Increasing prevalence myopia , particularly Asian urban child , confirm life style childhood infancy may play role ( 3 ) . Today potential effect early life nutrition myopia development later life become attractive field study . Breastfeeding related neural development affect visual acuity . Up wean , breastfeed main source many micronutrient [ include docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) ] , important light receptor brain neural development ( 6 ) . A study do Singapore show breastfeed independently relate likelihood myopia control cofactor ( 7 ) . But study limitation may affect result . This study small population size participant one school . All factor relate myopia control study . However , data pull three English birth cohort do 10-11y 15-16y child show effect ( 8 ) . Hence , result relationship breastfeed likelihood childhood myopia controversial . To examine association breastfeed pattern likelihood myopia 6-7y child , retrospective case-control study design National Nutrition Food Technology research Institute Iran . This study try ass almost cofactor may relate myopia ; child 's age , sex , height , birth weight , maternal age delivery , IQ ( intelligence quotient ) , near work , parental education ethnicity , parental myopia , child n-3 ( omega-3 ) fatty acid refine carbohydrate intake , maternal n-3 fatty acid intake , n-3 fatty acid intake infancy , physical activity confound factor may effect relationship among breastfeed pattern myopia .</detailed_description>
