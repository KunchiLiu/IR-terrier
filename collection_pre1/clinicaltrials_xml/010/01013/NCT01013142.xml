	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety MN-221 Subjects With Stable Moderate Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center dose escalation study subject diagnose stable moderate severe COPD . The study conduct approximately 6 Clinical Research Units ( CRUs ) . Subjects diagnosis stable moderate severe COPD screen must demonstrate improvement FEV1 bronchodilator treatment least 12 % Screen Visit 1 . The subject 's degree dyspnea capture British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) questionnaire , severity determine Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) spirometric criterion . Subjects meet entry criterion Screen Visit 1 ask return CRU Screen Visit 2 within 14 day Visit 1 . Subjects confirm entry criterion include degree COPD severity spirometry Screen Visit 2 randomize receive either MN-221 placebo . Serial spirometry perform 8 hour treatment period initiation study drug administration . Subjects discharge CRU complete Hour 8 study procedure ask return approximately 24 hour initiation study drug follow safety assessment include spirometry . A study diary provide subject upon discharge CRU complete instruct return site 24 hour Follow-up Visit . There three dose level include approximately 16 subject randomize receive either MN-221 placebo 3:1 ratio ( 12 subject receive MN-221:4 subject receive placebo ) . A risk/benefit evaluation perform study 's Safety Review Committee completion dose level prior escalate next dose level . Safety efficacy monitor throughout treatment period . Blood sample PK parameter metabolite identification obtain .</detailed_description>
