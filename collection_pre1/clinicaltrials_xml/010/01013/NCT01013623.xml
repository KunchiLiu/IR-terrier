	<brief_summary>This study establish role surgical versus nonsurgical approach patient whose melanoma spread distant site . Results help clinician develop standardized initial approach prolongs survival optimize quality life . Results also indicate whether Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) postoperative immunotherapy significantly improve outcome patient treat surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stage IV Surgery Versus Best Medical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design examine impact surgical resection versus medical therapy initial treatment therapy patient Stage IV melanoma . Surgical resection think efficacious highly select patient solitary metastasis , patient multiple site metastasis . Even solitary metastasis , considerable debate among major melanoma center whether undergo initial systemic medical therapy prior surgical resection prefer initial surgical resection upon Stage IV diagnosis . According Dr. Dan Coit , Co-leader Melanoma Disease Management Team Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute New York , trial initial medical therapy standard approach multidisciplinary melanoma service even patient solitary distant metastasis ( personal communication , 15 Dec 2009 ) . Many favor upfront medical therapy believe delay surgical resection may avoid unnecessary surgery identifying patient progress early due outgrowth occult metastases multiple site , may make patient unresectable . This Phase III , randomize , international , multicenter study metastasectomy without BCG versus best medical therapy initial therapy Stage IV melanoma . This study three arm : surgical resection plus BCG immune adjuvant , surgical resection plus observation , best medical therapy ( BMT ) . Since systemic medical therapy demonstrate superior DTIC multiple new therapy evaluate , choice constitutes best medical therapy determine individual investigator base standard care systemic medical therapy particular multicenter site . Best systemic medical therapy may include clinical trial new agent standard non-protocol treatment ( e.g. , DTIC Temodar accord standard care multi-center site ) . Patients progress best medical treatment arm may switch different medical therapy , appropriate , surgical therapy ; similarly , surgery patient may additional surgical resection receive medical therapy .</detailed_description>
