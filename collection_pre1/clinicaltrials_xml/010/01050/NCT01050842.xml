	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , bicalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Selective estrogen receptor modulators , raloxifene , may work together bicalutamide stop growth prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study give bicalutamide raloxifene together treat patient metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bicalutamide Raloxifene Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To describe 6-month progression-free survival rate , progression-free survival , overall survival patient receive bicalutamide raloxifene . II . To describe adverse event profile combine treatment bicalutamide raloxifene ( adverse event grade use NCI CTCAE version 3.0 ) . III . To describe quality life patient receive bicalutamide raloxifene . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral bicalutamide oral raloxifene day 1-28 . Treatment repeat 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
