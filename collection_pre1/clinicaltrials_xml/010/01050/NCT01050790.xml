	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . An autologous stem cell transplant may able replace blood-forming cell destroy lenalidomide azacitidine . Giving autologous lymphocyte transplant may help destroy remain cancer cell . PURPOSE : This pilot trial study well give lenalidomide together azacitidine work follow autologous stem cell transplant autologous lymphocyte infusion treat patient multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide + Azacitidine Adaptive Immunotherapy - &gt; Auto SCT Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility mobilize infuse autologous lymphocyte ( ALI ) follow immunomodulatory therapy comprise azacitidine lenalidomide patient multiple myeloma . Secondary - Determine ability proceed autologous stem cell transplantation patient . - Determine complete response rate 6 month follow transplant patient treat regimen . - Determine progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Monitor toxicity post-autologous stem cell infusion autologous lymphocyte . - Measure pre- post-ALI immune response cancer testis antigen ( CTA ) ( CTA-specific Ig T-cell repertoire ) . - Study expression CTA multiple myeloma azacitidine therapy . OUTLINE : - Immunomodulatory therapy : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously day 1-5 oral lenalidomide day 6-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Lymphapheresis : Patients undergo autologous lymphocyte harvest day 22 course 2 3 . - Autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) : Patients undergo single tandem ASCT use standard protocol . - Autologous lymphocyte infusion ( ALI ) : Patients undergo ALI approximately 28-60 day ASCT . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study correlative laboratory study , include CTA-specific immune monitoring RT-PCR , ELISPOT assay , flow cytometry . Tissue sample bone marrow aspirate also collect baseline , course one , course three CTA expression methylation study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
