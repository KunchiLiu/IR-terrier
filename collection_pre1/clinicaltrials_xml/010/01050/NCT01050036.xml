	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 . CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CBF AML Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) disease entity consist heterogeneous group different clinical feature prognosis . Cytogenetic status patient AML single important factor expect survival treatment response . Core binding factor ( CBF ) AML characterize presence cytogenetic abnormality , i.e. , balance translocation chromosome 8 21 [ ( 8 ; 21 ) ( q22 ; q22 ) ] pericentric inversion chromosome 16 [ inv ( 16 ) ( p13q22 ) ] less frequent variant , balance translocation ( 16 ; 16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) . Among adult de novo AML , ( 8 ; 21 ) inv ( 16 ) find 7 % 8 % patient , respectively1 . All subtypes CBF AML share chimeric fusion gene form disruption gene encode different subunit core bind factor , heterodimeric transcription factor complex . CBF AML accept disease entity favorable prognosis high complete remission rate ( 90 % ) conventional induction chemotherapy follow intensive consolidation treatment 3 4 cycle high-dose cytarabine ( HDAC ) . The overall survival patient group rise 60 - 70 % , encourage result support opinion HDAC preferable postremission therapy instead autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) allogeneic HCT . 1.2 . STRATEGY TO REDUCE RELAPSE IN CBF AML It think patient CBF AML first complete remission ( CR1 ) would benefit high-dose consolidation chemotherapy risk HCT outweigh benefit group . However , cumulative incidence relapse ( CIR ) report 54 % 50-60 % patient cure use contemporary treatment . The survival outcome unsatisfactory , especially elderly patient . Prebet et al report 5-year probability overall survival ( OS ) leukemia-free survival ( LFS ) 31 % 27 % , respectively intensive consolidation low-dose maintenance chemotherapy among patient CBF AML age 60 year old . To improve treatment outcome group , alternative strategy postremission therapy efficiency tolerability warrant , especially patient prone relapse . A number study stratify intensification postremission therapy accord risk relapse appropriate prognostic index identify high risk patient report , currently investigation . 1.3 . DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AML WITH INV ( 16 ) AND WITH T ( 8 ; 21 ) Recent study report two group seem distinct clinical entity stratify report separately . Patients ( 8 ; 21 ) short OS ( hazard ratio [ HR ] =1.5 , p=0.045 ) survival first relapse ( HR=1.7 , p=0.009 ) patient inv ( 16 ) . A similar difference find among patient undergone HCT ; 3-year OS patient ( 8 ; 21 ) inv ( 16 ) 50 % 72 % , respectively ( p=0.002 ) . Based result , discriminative postremission strategy could apply patient CBF AML - patient ( 8 ; 21 ) manage differently inv ( 16 ) application HCT prospective trial warrant clarify significance HCT chemotherapy . 1.4 . RISK STRATIFICATION IN AML WITH INV ( 16 ) Although AML inv ( 16 ) relatively good prognosis , substantial number patient ( i.e . 40-50 % ) finally relapse . In group , timely identification therapeutic stratification patient deem high risk relapse could ultimately result improvement clinical outcome . The minimal residual disease ( MRD ) monitor real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RQ-PCR ) assay CBFβ/MYH11 fusion transcript regard useful surrogate marker identify patient resistant disease predict relapse early remission . Lane et al report rise 1 log rise transcript level relative level remission bone marrow sample time post-induction follow correlate inferior LFS morphologic relapse ( HR 8.6 ) . Bounamici et al suggest patient whose transcript ratio bone marrow sample take remission great 0.25 % finally relapse , ratio 0.12 % might indicate patient curable state . Two conclusion deduce result ; first , considerable portion patient among CBF AML finally relapse . Second , post-induction MRD monitoring might helpful discriminate patient vulnerable relapse may benefit intensified consolidation therapy . 1.5 . RISK STRATIFICATION IN AML WITH T ( 8 ; 21 ) AML ( 8 ; 21 ) accept disease good prognosis categorize favorable cytogenetic risk group along AML inv ( 16 ) . According recent study , however , outcome AML patient ( 8 ; 21 ) disappoint contrary previous one . The biologic prognostic heterogeneity recently describe subgroup ( include subtypes CBF AML ) number promise biologic marker suggest . MRD monitor RQ-PCR flow cytometry also think useful method stratification patient ( 8 ; 21 ) , well inv ( 16 ) . C-kit mutation generally accept discriminate marker CBF AML increase relapse risk . A difference race consider important predictor ( 8 ; 21 ) AML , nonwhites failed induction often short OS white . Other biomarkers consider leukocyte count white blood cell , CD56 positivity , loss sex chromosome secondary cytogenetic abnormalities6 , submicroscopic deletion chromosome rearrangement , loss MRP gene translocation / inversion presence RAS/FLT3 mutation . Gene-expression profile suggest relevant way molecular characterization discriminate substantial biologic clinical heterogeneity within CBF AML . 1.6 . COMPARISON OF POSTREMISSION THERAPY FOR CBF AML The optimal postremission therapy CBF AML remain determined . Despite consider patient favorable risk group AML , approximately half patient cure current strategy , significant portion patient finally relapse overall survival unsatisfactory . Heterogeneity treatment outcome group also suggest tailor approach might prefer unique predefined strategy treat . Current state CBF AML indicate need improve therapeutic approach , include intensive consolidation obtain improved LFS . There prospective study support role HCT . A prospective trial impact cytogenetics kind consolidation therapy perform Visani et al show patient favorable group significantly longer disease-free survival ( DFS ) treat intensive induction allogeneic HCT intensive consolidation therapy . According result MRC AML 10 randomize control trial compare addition autologous HCT intensive chemotherapy alone AML CR1 , addition autologous HCT four course intensive chemotherapy reduce risk relapse , increase disease-free survival significantly , improve overall survival , although death remission autologous HCT group . However , number study support classic concept CBF AML CR1 would benefit HDAC risk HCT outweigh benefit . Delaunay et al report outcome patient inv ( 16 ) CR1 similar among patient allocate receive allogeneic HCT v HDAC8 . According meta-analysis perform 392 adult CBF AML prospective German AML treatment trial , type postremission therapy reveal difference intensive chemotherapy autologous HCT ( 8 ; 21 ) group chemotherapy , autologous HCT , allogeneic HCT inv ( 16 ) group . Recent result suggest possibility improve overall survival HCT . Subgroup analysis EORTC-LG/GIMEMA AML-10 trial patient young 46 year assign allogeneic HCT autologous HCT accord availability HLA-identical sibling donor , DFS rate similar patient good risk cytogenetics . Kuwatsuka et al report retrospective analysis result HCT perform CBF AML . OS different patient CR1 receive allogeneic HCT receive autologous HCT ( 8 ; 21 ) AML ( 84 % vs 77 % ; p=0.49 ) inv ( 16 ) AML ( 74 % vs 59 % , p=0.86 ) . 1.7 . OPTIMAL POSTREMISSION THERAPY FOR CBF AML In summary , HDAC chemotherapy recommend relevant postremission therapy patient CBF AML CR1 basis risk HCT outweigh clinical benefit reduce incidence relapse prolong LFS . With advance hematopoietic cell transplantation technique biomarkers risk stratification , HCT consider promising method improve overall outcome patient CBF AML . Until , previous result support introduction autologous HCT rather allogeneic HCT intensified postremission therapy CBF AML benefit HCT yet proven risk allogeneic HCT might outweigh benefit group . We hereby intend evaluate efficacy autologous HCT patient CBF AML CR1 .</detailed_description>
