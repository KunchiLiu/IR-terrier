	<brief_summary>Leishmaniasis diverse clinical manifestation cause different specie Leishmania endemic many country . Although Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( CL ) self-healing disease , take long time heal . Pentavalent antimonials still first-line treatment CL need multiple injection , painful tolerate patient , addition available treatment always effective resistance report . Paromomycin sulfate ( PM ) report show anti-Leishmania activity CL visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) since 1960s . Therapeutic strategy high efficacy urgently need especially Anthroponotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( ACL ) . Liposomes lipid bilayer molecule entrap water-soluble molecule internal water compartment water-insoluble one lipid bilayers . Liposomes , proper formulation size , deliver drug skin base similarity bilayers structure lipid vesicle natural membrane target macrophage within dermis . Several lipid-based formulation develop treat experimental leishmaniasis . Recently different dos liposomal formulation PM liposomal formulation Glucantime prepare show high efficacy vivo L. major infection BALB/c mouse . In study efficacy liposomal formulation PM liposomal formulation Glucantime combination systemic Glucantime treatment ACL parasitologically prove patient evaluate .
