	<brief_title>Folic Acid Creatine Therapeutic Approaches Lowering Blood Arsenic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 140 million people 70 country chronically expose arsenic ( As ) -contaminated drinking water concentration far exceed World Health Organization standard 10 µg/L . As carcinogen know cause cancer skin , bladder , lung , well ischemic heart disease neurologic impairment . Methylation ingest inorganic arsenic ( InAs ) methylarsonic- ( MMA ) dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) rely folate-dependent one carbon metabolism , utilize S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) methyl donor , facilitate urinary As elimination . The result Nutritional Influences Arsenic Toxicity ( NIAT ) study indicate folate deficiency hyperhomocysteinemia ( HHcys ) associate reduced capacity methylate arsenic risk factor arsenic-induced skin lesion . Furthermore , folic acid ( FA ) supplementation indeed facilitate As elimination significantly lower blood As concentration individual folate deficient . We also determine blood As good biomarker As exposure directly associate risk As-induced skin lesion . Collectively , implication finding FA enormous therapeutic potential ameliorate long-term health consequence arsenic exposure many population risk . However , several fundamental question remain addressed study . This trial design determine 1 ) whether FA supplementation lower blood As concentration general Bangladeshi population , 2 ) time point nadir blood As achieve , 3 ) whether creatine supplementation , alone addition 400 µg/d FA , spare methyl group , result low blood As , low homocysteine ( Hcys ) concentration , increased methylation As . The creatine arm base multiple study show urinary creatinine concentration strong predictor As methylation . The final step creatine biosynthesis methylation guanidinoacetate creatine ; process consume 50-75 % SAM-derived methyl group also responsible 50-75 % Hcys biosynthesis . Thus , trial test hypothesis creatine supplementation , shut endogenous creatine biosynthesis , spare methyl group , low Hcys , increase As methylation .</detailed_description>
