	<brief_summary>This study prospectively characterize molecular , cellular genetic property primary metastatic neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , retinoblastoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor , soft tissue sarcoma , adrenocortical tumor liver malignancy . These cell isolates use gene expression array analysis , genomic analysis [ SNP ] single nucleotide polymorphism chip , array [ CGH ] comparative genomic hybridization next generation sequencing , [ TEM ] transmission electron microscopy analysis . Additionally cell line orthotopic xenografts create obtained tumor specimen . The specificity TCRs examine compare pair TCR peripheral blood tumor infiltrate CD4+ CD8+ T cell . Epigenetic study perform look methylation profile cell investigate anti-tumor T cell response pre- post-PD1 inhibition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each year approximately 2,200 child United States diagnose neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) , retinoblastoma , soft tissue sarcoma , adrenocortical tumor liver malignancy . These aggressive pediatric solid tumor developmental tumor initiate period tissue growth morphogenesis neural crest , bone soft tissue . The overall survival rate tumor advance stage le 30 % . Despite intensive effort past three decade use multiple therapeutic modality include chemotherapy , surgery , radiation , autologous bone marrow transplant biological agent modest improvement long-term survival advance stage pediatric solid tumor . A good understanding molecular , cellular genetic change occur develop tissue tumor form could improve treatment devastate cancer . In particular , chemotherapeutic agent may effectively target key regulatory enzyme protein study good understand pathway disrupt cell progress preneoplastic lesion metastatic disease . The specific aim proposal identify change gene expression occur neuroblastoma , retinoblastoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor [ ESFT ] soft tissue sarcoma cell correlate change genetic cellular change tumor cell . [ RNA ] ribonucleic acid genomic [ DNA ] deoxyribonucleic acid isolated neuroblastoma , retinoblastoma , osteosarcoma , ESFT [ Ewing sarcoma family tumor ] soft tissue sarcoma ( primary metastatic lesion ) follow surgery bone marrow aspiration previously untreated patient . Additional testing conduct tumor sample point follow therapy surgical specimen obtain . When sufficient tumor sample remain pathological analysis banking , fresh primary tumor cell use prepare orthotopic xenograft establish model disease recapitulate advanced form neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor [ ESFT ] , retinoblastoma soft tissue sarcoma . For small group excess sample , study perform fixation electron microscopy process sample [ TEM ] transmission electron microscopy analysis . These study complement active research program characterizing molecular , cellular genetic feature genetically engineer mouse model disease . Biological sample cohort patient treated St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital complement sample collect process collaborate institution around world . Samples collect international collaborator use analysis [ DNA ] deoxyribonucleic acid [ RNA ] ribonucleic acid complement St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital cohort . Through collaboration study anticipate able obtain enough fresh tumor sample improve understanding multistage tumorigenesis pediatric solid malignancy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Must suspect know diagnosis neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor soft tissue sarcoma base initial diagnostic workup evidence gross disease amenable excision . Specimens may collect follow time point : initial biopsy , bone marrow aspiration procedure , tumor resection , time possible relapse . Patients diagnosis retinoblastoma base initial diagnostic workup require enucleation may enrol active therapeutic biologic protocol retinoblastoma . The patient his/her legal guardian , appropriate , must provide write informed consent within 30 day removal first collection tissue/bone marrow/blood sample protocol . The patient see St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital collaborate institution . Patients must less equal 25 year old time enrollment . Patient know Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C and/or HIV positive .</criteria>
