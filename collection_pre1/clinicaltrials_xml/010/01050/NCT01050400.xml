	<brief_title>CYP2D6 Screening Adverse Drug Reactions Codeine Breast Milk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , opioid analgesic codeine commonly administer breastfeed mother Caesarean section pain relief . Codeine originally consider safe use breastfeeding however , increase risk adverse drug reaction demonstrate mother take codeine , well breastfed infant , mother posse genetic variation result cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) ultra-rapid metabolizer ( UM ) phenotype . On average , people convert 10-15 % codeine dose morphine result pain relief however , UM individual convert 50 % codeine dose active morphine . As many 4 % North Americans may UMs mother breastfed infant high risk serious adverse event despite `` safe '' codeine dose due morphine overproduction accumulation mother breast milk . Observed side effect include severe sedation , decrease rate depth breathe even infant death . In response problem , hospital-based clinical trial strives identify at-risk UM mother-infant pair perform genetic test non-invasive , voluntary saliva sample mother give birth Caesarean section need codeine pain relief breastfeeding . We believe test allow u reliably identify at-risk UM mother-infant pair prevent adverse drug reaction tailor analgesic therapy genetic result : mother identify UMs give suitable analgesic , ibuprofen , place codeine-containing preparation . We propose prospective study generate high-level data support cost-effective genetic screening mother take codeine breastfeed begin take medication . Such test currently possible nation-wide scale collaboration Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network Drug Safety ( CPNDS ) .</detailed_description>
