	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder condition associate symptom feel urge urinate , urinating often , may may accompany leakage urine . A patient spinal cord injury ( SCI ) often suffer overactive bladder often lead urinary incontinence ( UI - unwanted leakage urine ) . OnaBoNT-A bladder injection study clinical research trial . The result show improvement urinary symptom reduce often urine leakage occur increase amount urine bladder hold . This purpose clinical trial see onaBoNT-A safe effective inject bladder treatment UI work well drug take mouth . A second purpose study perform research test urine sample provide volunteer . Urine present rich source information bladder diseases biomarkers ( chemical make-up urine cell ) examine learn yet undiscovered reason urinary disease . These test would beneficial result would lead good treatment urinary disease . Volunteers randomize either : ARM 1 : onaBoNT-A 200 U bladder injection placebo oral capsule daily ARM 2 : Placebo bladder injection ( saline ) oxybutynin ER 10mg capsule twice day . The treatment onaBoNT-A bladder injection placebo oral capsule day placebo bladder injection oxybutynin ER ( like Ditropan ) capsule twice day . Placebo contain active medicine . Participation study 6-7 month involve 5 visit clinic . The risk bladder onaBoNT-A</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OnabotulinumtoxinA ( onaBoNT-A ) Versus Oral Oxybutynin ER</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment neurogenic bladder dysfunction ( NGB ) limit suboptimal result achieve use standard antimuscarinic agent . A prominent role action alternative transmitters/growth factor peripheral micturition pathway emerge grow number pharmacologic localization study human . For example , recently publish data demonstrate significant increased expression Nerve Growth Factor chemokine/cytokine level patient detrusor overactivity NGB . Treatment onabotulinumtoxinA ( onaBoNT-A ) show reduce detrusor overactivity improve urinary symptom also significantly reduce tissue urine level factor NGF . Up point , study directly compare effect front-line therapy antimuscarinic agent versus onaBoNT-A urinary symptom patient NGB result spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . In addition , investigation examine effect antimuscarinic agent onaBoNT-A urinary level NGF chemokines/cytokines , whether change urinary level predict clinical response return symptom , change urinary level predate change clinical response . Access selective reliable urine test NGF chemokines/cytokines provide unique opportunity assess impact modulate agent bladder function . The main purpose proposal incorporate novel urine biomarker test exist clinical methodology order : 1 ) evaluate safety efficacy 200 U onaBoNT-A inject detrusor versus oral oxybutynin treatment urinary incontinence ( UI ) cause neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( NDO ) spinal cord injure patient 2 ) determine potential role urine biomarkers guide process patient selection identify surrogate predictor treatment outcomes . This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study ass safety efficacy onaBoNT-A 10 mg twice day oral oxybutynin hydrocholoride spinal cord injure patient diagnose neurogenic detrusor overactivity . Volunteers include male female spinal cord injuries 18 80 year age . Volunteers randomize use block randomization approach either : ARM 1 : onaBoNT-A 200 U bladder injection placebo oral capsule daily ARM 2 : Placebo bladder injection ( saline ) oxybutynin ER 10mg capsule twice day . Subjects randomize one two treatment arm , use block size 4 . The order treatment assign block randomized process repeat consecutive block subject subject randomize . This process ensure every fourth randomize subject , number subject treatment group equal . There five study visit approximately 6-7 month . The significance experiment begin fact propose intervention first randomize clinical trial compare effect onaBoNT-A ( onabotulinumtoxinA ) bladder injection versus anticholinergic medication detrusor hyperreflexia ( DH ) . In addition , first study profile urine level signal protein nerve growth factor ( NGF ) chemokines/cytokines possible bio-markers bladder overactivity patient neurogenic detrusor overactivity . Finally , study date compare effect onaBoNT-A anticholinergic medication urine NGF chemokine/cytokine level . If hypothesis prove correct , significance treat patient spinal cord injury botulinum toxin A less incontinence , requirement low dos avoidance anticholinergic medication associate side effect , ability prevent complication DH/DESD ( Detrusor-External Sphincter Dyssynergia ) include urinary tract infection , decubiti , impairment quality life . Although study write moderate length ( i.e . total 4 year ) , hope find significant result , able capture longitudinal history population extend follow-up long duration ( i.e . 10 year ) .</detailed_description>
