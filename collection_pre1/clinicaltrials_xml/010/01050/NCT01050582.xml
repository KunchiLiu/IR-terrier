	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Effects Risperidone Compared With Other Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs Growth Sexual Maturation Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study find effect long-term use atypical antipsychotic ( drug use treat mental health behavior disorder ) child adolescents growth physical maturity . Atypical antipsychotic use treatment wide range disorder child adolescent , ; schizophrenia , bipolar mania , autistic disorder disruptive behavior disorder . This study involve use new medication , look side effect child adolescent may experience take atypical antipsychotic . One side effect atypical antipsychotic increase level `` prolactin '' , hormone occur naturally body lead `` hyperprolactinemia '' condition pituitary gland produce much prolactin . In order investigate possible side effect , two group child adolescent ( age 8 16 ) diagnosis schizophrenia , bipolar mania , autistic disorder , conduct disruptive behavior disorder recently treat atypical antipsychotic enrol ; 1 group child adolescents either currently take recently treat risperidone second group child adolescents either currently take recently treat similar type atypical antipsychotic therapy . The result compare see age physical maturation , growth development differs two group , use data collect office visit previous information available exist medical record . The patient 's growth assess use information height weight take medical record different time point ( one year previous ) since start treatment antipsychotic therapy . In addition , also one visit clinic growth stage sexual maturity patient review study doctor patient 's assessment , use questionnaire picture develop specially assess stage physical development ( call - Tanner stage ) . In addition , one blood sample take patient check level prolactin hormone blood see differs treatment group . Potential patient identify automated database and/or medical chart review . If , fully understand purpose study , parent , legal guardian child agree participate signing inform consent ( child sign assent form ) , information ( specify ) relate child 's treatment development collect directly central medical record note keep child 's doctor evaluation . The following data collect available medical record : information patient 's use antipsychotic drug prescription ; previous record patient 's height , weight , growth ; physical sexual development ( call , Tanner stage [ developmental stage ] ) available ; result previous blood test take evaluate level hormone prolactin available ; , history side effect could relate increased level hormone prolactin . All information collect within 1 year patient start antipsychotic therapy . The information ( available ) also collect following time patient start take atypical antipsychotic medication present time . As much information possible collected period time determination take antipsychotic drug may influence patient 's growth make . The study doctor see patient single study visit . This visit take place convenient time approximately one week inform consent/assent obtain . At clinic visit , study doctor examination check patient 's general health ass growth physical development . These include : physical examination ( include developmental stage assessment [ Tanner stage ] ) , weight height , vital sign ( pulse , respiration rate , temperature blood pressure ) , medical history , collection information regard occurrence side effect thought relate use atypical antipsychotic medication relate hormone prolactin . In addition assess study doctor , patient ask complete Tanner Stage questionnaire . This involve patient review picture write description child different stage physical development . The patient decide picture/description representative body . The study doctor also look patient 's current use medication . Each patient participate study one week . The outcome measure study compare Z-scores height , age current Tanner stage , prolactin-related adverse event patient expose risperidone patient expose atypical antipsychotic drug . Outcome measure collect study visit retrospectively time exposure 2 year prior study visit .</detailed_description>
