	<brief_summary>Despite initial positive signal recent statistic , breast cancer continue claim substantial number live approximately 500,000 death worldwide 2005 Thus current treatment paradigm - surgery , radiation systemic chemo hormonal therapy biological therapy -still fail cure significant number woman early breast cancer new treatment strategy need improve current result early advance disease . Recurrent metastatic breast cancer incurable malignancy median survival 20-24 month [ Hortobagyi , 1998 ] change significantly last decade fewer 20 % patient still alive 5 year diagnosis recurrence . Although small improvement survival new therapy , metastatic breast cancer remain incurable , ultimately , fatal disease . The introduction novel combination therapy potential target different pathway cancer cell , lead improve efficacy . Further study optimize combination therapy , ameliorate AEs , critically important patient metastatic breast cancer . Lapatinib oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor potently inhibit EGFR HER2 [ Spector , 2005 ] . Lapatinib combination capecitabine approve 20 country treatment patient advance metastatic breast cancer whose tumor overexpress HER2 . All patient study lead lapatinib approval receive prior therapy include anthracycline , taxane , trastuzumab . The relevance HER2/neu target breast cancer , combine promising preclinical clinical data regard use lapatinib , provide rationale formal evaluation agent combine non taxane agent gemcitabine vinorelbine progression taxanes trastuzumab base therapy metastatic disease set chemotherapy option use daily practice subset patient . This randomized phase II , open label , multicentric , international , 3 arm treatment study patient confirm HER2+ metastatic breast cancer taxane progression . The main objective investigate ( CBR ) safety 3 different combination Lapatinib therapy ( plus capecitabine gemcitabine vinorelbine ) determine whether either , , Lapatinib /Vinorelbine Lapatinib/Gemcitabine consider reasonable alternative establish Lapatinib/Capecitabine standard combination . The decision whether study either new combination base toxicity efficacy profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In area trastuzumab available barrier access , patient must receive trastuzumab adjuvant metastatic setting . However , country trastuzumab approve available patient due reimbursement consideration , trastuzumab na√Øve patient allow consider efficacy data Lapatinib subset patient . This trial use design ensure selection one good treatment combination additional clinical Approximately ( 165 ) , meet criterion efficacy analysis define , enrol study single stage process . The sample size accrue 16 month , follow-up 24 month study period randomization progression . The study include Screening/Baseline Period , Treatment Period post-treatment Follow-Up Period . Patients continue receive investigational product disease progression early discontinuation investigational product reason . Patients discontinue investigational product ( ) without disease progression continue evaluate efficacy progression receive first subsequent anti-cancer therapy . Once progression document , patient follow survival approximately 3-month interval death .</detailed_description>
