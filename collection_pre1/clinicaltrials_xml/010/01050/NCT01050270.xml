	<brief_summary>This study design assess impact new approach therapy paracetamol poisoning . Standard therapy currently acetylcysteine intravenous infusion 20.25h . This regimen give deem `` risk '' use standard criterion ( British National Formulary 200920 ) . It 3 major problem , adverse event ( nausea vomit anaphylactoid reaction ) , therapy duration complexity administration . This study primarily design test efficacy prophylactic anti-emetic therapy . It also provide sufficient experience data modify shortened IV acetylcysteine regimen adequately design power study modify regimen new treatment common poison . Such approach major potential reduce patient adverse event acetylcysteine therapy shorten duration hospital stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scottish Newcastle Anti-emetic Pre-treatment Paracetamol Poisoning Study ( SNAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paracetamol common poison see United Kingdom present approximately 40 % patient admit self harm . Current treatment involve use antidote acetylcysteine patient deem risk potential liver damage . This give intravenous infusion period 20.25 hour . This regimen design 1970s empirical , large load dose antidote administer follow 2 decrease concentration . It cumbersome calculate dilute within ward therefore subject error preparation . The initial infusion associate significant rate adverse reaction , particular nausea vomit anaphylactoid reaction . The latter particularly troublesome occur 15 % patient treat . Therapy discontinue often confusion whether restart timely manner . Studying antidotes management poison challenge least patient population limit time available make decision gain consent . This first major clinical trial antidote therapy poison UK 30 year . The final objective work develop therapeutic regimen acetylcysteine cause high rate adverse reaction also easier nurse make . The present study focus potential use ondansetron , anti-emetic , prior administration acetylcysteine . It also allow preliminary data collect new approach give acetylcysteine use modified 12 h regimen , include slow initial intravenous infusion . The primary trial outcome therefore inform efficacy ondansetron pre-treatment anti-emetic situation . In addition valuable data incidence adverse effect cause modified acetylcysteine regimen , change liver function inflammatory response paracetamol liver injury cause paracetamol within modified acetylcysteine treatment obtain . In addition opportunity take convenience sample 40 patient study pharmacokinetics acetylcysteine group use standard modify regimen . A factorial design use answer key clinical question . In total maximum 250 patient recruit anticipated data 200 available final analysis . The demographic patient group essentially Caucasian English-speaking stage propose recruit non-English-speaking subject .</detailed_description>
