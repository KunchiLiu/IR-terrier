	<criteria>Ulcer size 1.0 16.0 cm2 time randomization measurement take sharp debridement perform screening visit . Wounds must free necrotic tissue fibrin slough debridement least 90 % surface cover granulation tissue . Target ulcer must present least 6 week prior randomization . Other ulcer close study ulcer allowable may size great 2cm away study ulcer ; 4 ulcer total target limb allow . A duplex ultrasound study document venous disease must perform within year study entry . The ultrasound exam document either chronic occlusion target limb popliteal , femoral , iliac vein vena cava , occlusion great lesser saphenous vein , reflux either deep , saphenous , perforate vein . No ulcer target limb include study ulcer may deep enough expose structure deep adipose lay skin muscle , fascia , tendon , joint , bone . The presence sinus tracts sufficiently marsupialized wound depth assess gross visual inspection similarly exclusion . At Screening Randomization Visits , presence significant periwound cellulitis need administer systemic antibiotic . system antibiotic therapy indication within 10 day screen exclusion . Baseline arterial study obtain within one year screen screen visit must show either anklebrachial index affect limb great equal 0.75 base high two pedal artery systolic pressure measure Doppler ultrasound compare ipsilateral brachial artery systolic pressure determine Doppler ultrasound . Any major surgery trauma affect target limb tibial fracture , knee arthroplasty , endovascular open arterial venous surgery femoral stenting within 180 day randomization . Participation clinical trial involve therapy wound heal within 30 day randomization . Concurrent administration systemic agent influence wound heal prednisone dexamethasone quantity , cytotoxic chemotherapy agent , immunosuppressive therapy . Previous ionize radiation therapy dose near wound bed ( within 5 cm ) . A history cancer target limb except previous skin cancer treat target limb provide biopsy target wound obtain within 90 day randomization confirm absence neoplasia . Severe renal failure serum creatinine great 2.5 subject hemodialysis . Severe hepatic insufficiency : know cirrhosis , degree ascites , serum transamines three time upper limit normal . Known allergy intolerance cadexomeric iodine latex free Profore bandage . The presence 1 ) implant pacemaker , automatic defibrillator , neurostimulator , bone stimulators , cochlear implant , device metal lead ; 2 ) implant programmable pump intravenous intrathecal drug delivery ; 3 ) metal implant within 25 cm area treatment . Pregnancy . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception . Live expectancy last one year . Uncompensated uncontrolled right heart failure associate edema . Inability walk independently ( adaptive device walker cane allow ) . BMI great 50 . Severe anemia , hemoglobin le 8.5 Poorly control diabetes , A1cHgb great 12 Severe hypoalbuminemia , serum albumen less 2.6 . Active local systemic malignancy lung cancer leukemia Severe hypertension systolic bp great 180 diastolic bp great 100 Severe hypoxemia chronic oxygen ventilator therapy . HIV infection unless retroviral therapy viral load undetectable PCR .</criteria>
