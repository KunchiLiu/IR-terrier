	<brief_summary>Warfarin commonly use anti-coagulant , narrow therapeutic index wide inter-individual inter-ethnic variation dose requirement . Several genetic non-genetic factor identify could influence warfarin dose requirement . However , current know predictive factor could explain 50-60 % warfarin dose variability . Inter-ethnic difference genetic influence warfarin dose requirement also exist . We hypothesize genetic factor CYP2C9 VKORC1 may influence warfarin dose serve optimize warfarin dosing .</brief_summary>
