	<brief_summary>Concurrent administration intravenous vitamin C ( ascorbic acid , 1.5 g/kg , infuse two three time weekly ) together certain cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen could prove effective treatment patient advanced malignancy exist chemotherapy usually ineffective . The primary objective study identify tolerable safe dose intravenous vitamin C administer cytotoxic chemotherapy attempt empirically identify specific vitamin C-chemotherapy regimen clinical response unusually favorable minimum 2 month therapy , determine CT scan biomarkers , appropriate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cytotoxic chemotherapy relatively ineffective large proportion common cancer . Combining redox active molecule certain chemotherapy regimen could increase anti-cancer activity protect host tissue toxicity loss anti-cancer activity . Research area advocate cancer organization , previous clinical trial combination chemotherapy antioxidant therapy small , poorly design , unsystematic . Appropriate study treatment concept require systematic , meticulous empirical approach similar one use conventional cytotoxic drug discovery . This Phase I-II study design identify promise chemotherapy-antioxidant protocol determine acceptability limit toxicity patient relentlessly progressive cancer conventional chemotherapy clinically indicate know minimally marginally effective . The tolerable dose intravenous ascorbic acid ( IVAA ) cancer patient normal renal function receive chemotherapy 1.5 g/kg per 90 120 minute infusion ( Hoffer et al , Ann Oncol 2008 ; 19:1969-1974 ) . Side effect minimal non-existent . In dose-escalating study IVAA 0.9 g/kg per infusion first chemotherapy cycle , increase 1.5 g/kg per infusion subsequent cycle , first 3 participant . If well tolerate expect , initial dose 1.5 g/kg per infusion subsequent participant . Infusions take place 2 3 time per week , bracket day chemotherapy . Standard tolerance adverse effect criterion use . Therapy continue minimum 2 month , continue event disease stabilization response , determine CT scan biomarkers , evaluation continue every 2 month .</detailed_description>
