	<criteria>Patients present emergency Signs symptom acute ischemic stroke : impairment language , motor function , cognition and/or gaze , vision neglect . Patients NIH Stroke Scale score &gt; 4 Age less 19 Patient symptomatic great five hour . Intravenous thrombolytic therapy must institute within three hour symptom onset order minimize risk Intracerebral symptomatic hemorrhage ; intervention intraarterial thrombolytic therapy clot retrieval allow sixhour window . One hour achievable time arrival institution therapy , therefore fivehour limit enrollment allow great number patient possibility therapy . Inability verify clear onset symptom . As noted , time elapse since patient 's last known baseline state correlate Intracerebral symptomatic hemorrhage , therapy approve patient clear time onset .</criteria>
