	<detailed_description>It increasingly recognise debridement devitalise , bacterially contaminate senescent tissue essential component effective treatment delay heal wound . Whilst passive autolytic enzymatic debridement procedure place , patient unable tolerate surgical procedure , judicious use surgical debridement rapidly remove necrotic , contaminated tissue slough show offer many advantage return wound heal trajectory . Whilst surgical debridement procedure conventionally perform scalpel sharp instrumentation , alternative technique VERSAJET Hydrosurgery System become widespread . To increase adoption new technology , essential clinical improvement assess alongside potential impact cost debridement net financial impact hospital . In fiscal year 2004 , 57,000 discharge DRG code 217 ( 'wound debridement skin graft except hand ) United States . Mean length stay ( payer ) 11 day mean charge $ 52,800 . In 2005 , Medicare fund 15,800 discharge code . Average charge patient $ 56,500 average reimbursement $ 18,2654 . In context particularly important potential patient benefit cost impact new technology fully assess . It hypothesise decrease time achieve stable wound closure lead patient benefit , also potential reduction cost treatment due e.g . repeat procedure , long hospital stay , infection etc . The purpose study investigate difference time closure wound surgically excise VERSAJET Hydrosurgery System surgically excise use conventional operating room technique .</detailed_description>
