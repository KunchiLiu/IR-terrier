	<brief_summary>Each year around 200 blood donor UK find infected blood-borne disease ( HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HTLV ) , several others identify increase risk variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( vCJD ) . Although notification procedure infection vary , effectiveness appropriateness never evaluate systematic study . The propose research design assess response blood donor notification satisfaction inform infection . The study implement use standard questionnaire-based measure ( French et al , 2004 ; Marteau &amp; Bekker , 1992 ) . The study involve approximately 600 blood donor inform infection possible infection blood-borne disease 2008 2009 , approximately 100 donor notify possible risk vCJD infection 2005 . A comparable group 2005 donor include control effect time . As majority donor test positive donate NHS Blood Transplant ( NHSBT ) , participant identify NHSBT database , availability confirm GP specialist clinician . A standardized questionnaire send identify eligible . The study last 12 month , direct participant involvement limited time required complete questionnaire , take one hour . To safeguard confidentiality , identifiable personal data use analysis . Where demographic medical information already hold NHSBT retrieve minimise response burden , pseudonymised use . The study sponsor blood service England , Wales , Scotland Northern Ireland . The result use inform notification procedure future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Notification Donors With Positive Microbiology Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess impact notification blood donor test positive microbiology marker blood-borne ( mostly ) currently incurable infection ( hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV , HTLV vCJD ) . Specifically , study focus donor ' response notify infection possible infection , satisfaction notification process . The data collect used examine predictor satisfaction thus help inform notification procedure future . In UK , donation unpaid voluntary , consider safe method blood collection ( WHO Global Database Blood Safety ( GDBS ) Blood Safety Indicators ) . Out 1.9 million UK blood donation 2008 , 187 ( &gt; 0.01 % ) test positive . With low incidence focus blood safety , defer donor management largely informed anecdotal evidence historical development . The notification process standardise within blood service ( e.g . NHSBT Management Donors Confirmed Positive Microbiological Markers , MPD/MED/009/05 ) , never evaluate systematic study . Worldwide , handful study approach issue ( Tynell et al , 2007 ; Kleinman et al , 2004 ) , suggest donor experience confusion anxiety result notification . It therefore possible current notification procedure adequately address donor ' need . A recent in-depth qualitative study impact notification possible increase risk variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease ( vCJD ) public health purpose ( Elam et al , await publication ) find notification shock event subject ' life , although lasting emotional impact . Several factor influence well information give notification retain implement . As anticipated blood donation screen vCJD soon test become available , need development optimal notification procedure identify . The propose study build finding . Blood donor comprise unique population , usually characterise high altruism , low risk-taking , conservatism concern health ( Simmons et al. , 1993 ; Burnett , 1981 ) . For reason , notification serious infection could cause great distress , experience stigma self-image damage average person ( Jackson , 2005 ; Orsini , 2002 ; Schulte , 2002 ; Murray , 1990 ) , therefore handle utmost care . Currently , blood donation UK routinely test syphilis , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) human T-lymphotropic virus ( HTLV ) . Additionally , indicate donor history , supplementary test malaria , T-cruzi , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , West Nile virus ( WNV ) perform . For purpose study , donor notify positive test result routine screen survey . Those test positive syphilis include universally curable nature infection . A mail questionnaire choose best form data collection significant dispersion study population , continuity contact method , low intrusiveness instrument . Those wish participate able complete questionnaire time place convenient . As initial communication letter , expect mail survey accompany cover letter accessible donor . A telephone- web-based survey completion option also offer facilitate access . The questionnaire focus three main area interest , namely satisfaction , emotional response understanding . These identify in-depth vCJD study , donor record literature review issue pertinent notification process , one influence manner information provide . Personal characteristic circumstance consider , already well research perspective coping ( Kaye &amp; Raghavan , 2002 ; Baile et al. , 2000 ; Kraus et al. , 2000 ; Buckman &amp; Kason , 1992 ) , control blood donation , thus limit usefulness inform donor notification process . To ensure appropriateness feasibility question , avoid misrepresentation , survey pilot small sample donor test positive routine screening 2007 . The return complete questionnaire treat implied consent , return empty one without opt-out option select take signify donor 's decision give consent . The main risk identify contact positive donor re-traumatisation , helpline number provide allow experience distress discuss situation . It hop , however , infection study chronic , re-traumatisation would rare minimal . It hop character project , aim aid development notification procedure would satisfactory donor receive positive test result future , would welcome subject opportunity engage activity could benefit others . Should donor 's reaction suggest situation may serious , every attempt make offer follow-up care . Any aggravating issue inherent questionnaire , however , hopefully identify rectified piloting stage . The direct donor burden , choose participate study , limit 20-30 minute need complete questionnaire . Only Principal Investigator researcher access identifiable personal data , PI member donor 's healthcare team , researcher within remit position . The researcher 's access use donor record comply Good Clinical Practice guideline , NHS Confidentiality Code Practice . Donor name number cod store separately pseudonymised survey data . The file link donor identifiable information code store duration research project . The raw survey data file return questionnaire store securely minimum 2 year . Only pseudonymised data use analysis , identifiable donor information include ensue report . The demographic data age , ethnicity sex already available donor record pseudonymised use reduce response burden . Only data theoretically relevant study include . The access study file restrict , information store share securely per NHS guideline . No identifiable personal data share . The survey data statistically analyse use SPSS . Every attempt make assess extent non-response error use pseudonymised demographic data non-respondents . Due large number variable involve , main attention give descriptive statistic . To avoid misinterpretation , conclusion draw data discuss Project Management Group make researcher isolation . The result study publish accessible participant general public way , request directly . Both PI researcher employee NHSBT . The propose research project fund four UK blood service , aim improve service offer . It consider response , use benefit service user ; however , intend investigate response blood donor donate England North Wales . Due unique characteristic group , without study result generalise entire UK population country .</detailed_description>
