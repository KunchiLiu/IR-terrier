	<brief_summary>Post operative ileus ( POI ) , temporary paralysis intestine , serious health care problem . It normally occur patient surgery abdomen case result serious complication . The objective study determine inhale low dos carbon monoxide ( CO ) colon surgery shorten duration normal POI and/or prevent development POI complication patient undergo colon surgery . This preliminary study conduct ten healthy volunteer monitor blood level adverse effect occur different duration exposure inhale CO establish safe dose patient main trial . For main trial , patient require surgery colon assign randomly receive one hour treatment either CO oxygen face mask operation . We hypothesize healthy volunteer able tolerate 1 hour dos 250 ppm CO minimal side effect . It also anticipate dose CO administer , blood level CO remain well poisonous level . Finally , anticipate blood level CO return baseline level within 24 hour follow last dose CO .</brief_summary>
