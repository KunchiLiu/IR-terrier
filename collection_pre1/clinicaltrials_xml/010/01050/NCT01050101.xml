	<detailed_description>This study design gain well understanding meal viscosity utility dietary source viscous polysaccharide fiber modulate postprandial metabolic satiety mechanisms pre- post- menopausal overweight woman order optimize acute metabolic response meal well favorably affect appetite , food intake overall body weight control . Objectives study include : 1 . To investigate effect viscous polysaccharide type fiber meal postprandial intestinal-phase mechanism satiety [ eg. , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) ] meal-associated metabolic ( eg. , glucose , insulin , triglyceride ) response pattern low glycemic index ( GI ) , fiber-controlled preload meal compare low fiber , high GI meal overweight pre- post- menopausal woman . 2 . To characterize subjective behavioral satiety response study-specific preload meal vary viscous fiber content well determine relationship satiety responses preload-associated physiological response overweight pre- post- menopausal woman . 3 . To examine influence menopausal status overweight woman physiological , subjective behavioral response study preloads . The study randomize , 3-arm , 6-sequence , within-subjects , crossover , treatment-controlled study utilize repeat measure , multiple sample paradigm evaluate metabolic satiety response pattern low glycemic index ( GI ) fiber-controlled preload treatment differ viscous fiber content compare high GI preload meal . The study test 3 isocaloric treatment preloads relatively healthy overweight , mildly obese , pre- post- menopausal woman . Preload meal prepare breakfast meal use muffin yogurt beverage / shake base glycemic index ( GI ) meal , include fiber / viscous fiber content , manipulate . All preloads match close possible sensory quality well macronutrient composition , fiber energy content volume . The 3 treatment include fiber source either viscous polysaccharide fiber source , eg. , psyllium husk , insoluble non-viscous produce fiber source , eg. , cellulose , respectively . These fiber commercially available . Preload meal prepare contain 1 kcal/g offer 600 kcal meal portion . The macronutrient distribution fat , carbohydrate protein 30 % , 55 % 15 % energy , respectively . Fiber include 2 level : 2 g/100 kcal 2 fiber contain preload meal fiber high GI low fiber control . These level fiber consistent previously study breakfast meal higher fiber meal , recommend intake adult Americans . Preload meal match closely possible micronutrient sensory ( palatability , sweetness , texture ) quality . Preload meal provide fasting condition consume within 20 minute . Subsequent food intake measure lab test meal food record home thereafter . Subjects receive preload meal random order ~ 1 month apart order standardize cyclic phase within pre-menopausal group . Each preload test session include collection food record menstrual log , in-lab preload test meal consumption , multiple blood sample visual analog scale completion . Blood sample collection visual analog scale ( VAS ) completion occur ( fast , time 0 ) preload meal consumption 20 , 40 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 min thereafter . A test meal lunch offer 2.5 h post-preload meal consumption . Test meal provide ad libitum . Final two blood draw satiety evaluation occur lunch ( 210 240 minute ) . Blood measure glucose , insulin , triglyceride CCK specific time period list . Occuring time period , subject complete VAS , validate method assess subjective measure appetite . Subjects also rate preload meal use VAS number sensory quality assess palatability .</detailed_description>
