	<detailed_description>This single-centre , non-randomised , open-label , single-dose , three-period study plan include eight healthy female volunteer . Subjects attend screen visit within 21 day dose . In Period 1 , intravenous dose HAL 0.4 mg/kg include 100 nCi ( 3.7 kBq ) 14C infused one hour period . In Period 2 , vaginal dose HAL 150 mg include 13,9 kBq 14C HAL administer 7 hour . In period 3 , follow colon cleaning , 100mg HAL enema include 14,8 kBq 14C instill 30 minute 8 subject . Period 1 , 2 Period 3 conduct identical manner except subject receive HAL different dose route . Blood sample draw 3 day follow evaluate single dose pharmacokinetics HAL dose route . In addition , urine faeces collect Period 1 . The urine face sample store possible future analysis . There minimum 7 day washout three dose period . Subjects attend final follow-up visit 14 day blood sample visit third study period . The total amount 14C-label use volunteer estimate approximately 33.3 kBq . No formal calculation radiation burden make . Based data full-dose ADME study estimate dose give radiation burden le 0.01 mSv , fall ICRP category I : trivial risk .
