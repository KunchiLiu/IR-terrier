	<detailed_description>Each year U.S. 400,000 people survive stroke approximately 80 % acute stroke survivor lose arm hand movement skill . Movement impairment typically treat intensive , hands-on physical occupational therapy several week initial brain injury . Unfortunately , due economic pressure U.S. health care system , stroke patient receive less therapy go home sooner . Our goal study develop upper extremity robotic training system acute chronic stroke population improve movement ability intensive repetitive movement clinic without continuous supervision therapist .</detailed_description>
