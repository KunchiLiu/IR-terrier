	<brief_summary>The grow population University Nebraska Medical Center patient heart failure combine increase number surgical procedure perform year support need critical analysis appropriately manage patient perioperative period , especially non-cardiac surgery . Echo-guided hemodynamic management ( EGHEM ) use echocardiography data normalize and/or optimize real-time , cardiac output ventricular filling pressure perioperative period non-cardiac surgical case . The purpose study test hypothesis EGHEM compare standard management practice result reduce length hospital stay noncardiac surgery population . The primary goal health care provider patient require anesthetic care , perioperative care , critical care ensure adequacy patient 's circulatory function optimize cardiac output ventricular filling pressure . Currently , use ECG monitor systemic blood pressure standard care assess circulatory function . However , data provide accurate information cardiac output ventricular filling pressure patient cardiovascular risk factor and/or comorbidities . As result , manage hemodynamic parameter patient , well intravenous fluid need resuscitation strategy , hypothesize use traditional approach may lead significant volume overload post-operative cardiovascular complication morbidity . In study propose EGHEM strategy incorporate standard echocardiography generate data point addition systemic blood pressure ECG signal ass , manage , modify optimize patient cardiac preload , afterload , heart rate contractility perioperative period . Based initial observation preliminary data use EGHEM approach , hypothesize demonstrate significant decrease hospital length stay overall decrease perioperative morbidity 30 day non-cardiac surgery population use EGHEM compare standard practice . In proposal design single center , prospective , randomized clinical trial test hypothesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Step 1 : Patient selection The first step EGHEM/EGAM process appropriate patient selection . Patients follow cardiovascular risk factor and/or comorbidities schedule non-cardiac surgery candidate EGHEM/EGAM : 1 . Urology/gynecology/General surgical patient 2 . Non-cardiac surgical population 3. age 65 year old , OR 19 year old one follow risk factor : 1 . Hypertension ( HTN ) 2 . Diabetes 3 . Obesity ( body mass index [ BMI ] &gt; 35 ) 4 . Renal insufficiency 5 . Tobacco usage 6 . Hypercholesterolemia 7 . Sleep apnea/heavy snore night 8 . Clinical diagnosis CHF define : - Dyspnea exertion - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea - Orthopnea - Elevated jugular venous pressure - Pulmonary rale - Third heart sound - Cardiomegaly pulmonary edema chest x-ray - Peripheral edema - Hepatomegaly - Pleural effusion 9 . Palpitations/irregular heart beat 10 . Chest pain rest exercise 11 . Murmur examination 12 . Known coronary artery disease ( CAD ) /stents/coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) 13 . Known valvular disease 14 . Known stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) Standard Medical Care Step 2 : Pre-op assessment Step 2 EGAM process involve bedside , transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) pre-op assessment . The pre-op TTE perform one co-investigators , take less 10 minute complete . The information acquire TTE pre-op assessment include follow five evaluation , order importance : 1 . Cardiac output leave side heart use spectral Doppler measurement ; 1 . Left ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT ) velocity time integral ( VTI ) 2 . Heart rate 2 . Filling pressure leave side heart use spectral Doppler measurement ; 1 . The pulmonary venous flow pattern define co-dominant , systolic dominant diastolic dominant 2 . The mitral inflow pattern define normal , impaired relaxation , pseudonormal restrictive 3 . The E/e ' ratio velocity 3 . Mitral valve structure function ; 4 . Aortic valve structure function ; 5 . Biventricular contractility . These evaluation perform use follow TTE view : A. Parasternal ( PS ) window : With patient leave lateral decubitus position , TTE probe place 3rd leave intercostal space next sternum ; light probe direct toward patient 's right shoulder . The 2-dimensional image long axis ( LAX ) acquire first . In view , follow evaluate : - Color Doppler aortic valve ( AV ) mitral valve ( MV ) - E-point septal separation ( EPSS ) To evaluate PS short axis ( SAX ) , probe rotate clockwise 60 degree . The 2-dimensional view obtain mid-papillary level . B. Apical window : With patient left , lateral , decubitus position , probe place 5th 6th intercostal space leave side , close nipple line . The light probe direct toward floor bed 4-chamber view . The following assessment perform 4-chamber view : - Two-dimensional image ; - Pulsed-wave ( PW ) Doppler right upper pulmonary vein ; - PW Doppler tip MV ; - PW Doppler MV annulus tissue Doppler ; - Color Doppler tricuspid valve ( TV ) MV necessary base PS LAX window . For apical LAX , probe rotate counterclockwise light direct toward patient 's right shoulder . In LAX view , velocity time integral ( VTIs ) use PW leave ventricular outflow track ( LVOT ) continuous wave ( CW ) level AV acquire . C. Subcostal window : With patient supine , TTE probe place right costal ridge direct toward heart . The light direct toward sonographer ( toward patient 's left ) ass 4-chamber view . For subcostal inferior vena cava ( IVC ) view , probe slightly rotate counterclockwise IVC assess . Standard Medical Care Step 3 : Management strategy Step 3 EGHEM/EGAM process define patient management strategy base pre-op TTE assessment . The main goal patient management maintain normal cardiac output fill pressure . Primary secondary finding associate EGAM strategy achieve goal outline Table 1 Table 2 , respectively . Table 1 : Primary finding associate management strategy maintain normal cardiac output fill pressure . Echo-Generated Findings EGHEM/EGAM Strategy Cardiac output status Filling pressure status Normal High Preload reduction Low Normal Afterload reduction Low High Afterload preload reduction High High Preload reduction High Normal low Increase preload Table 2 : Secondary finding associate management strategy optimize patient management . Echo-Generated Finding EGHEM/EGAM Strategy Filling Pressure Other High Aortic stenosis Preload reduction Normal Aortic stenosis Safe afterload reduction - Mitral regurgitation Afterload reduction - Low contractility Inotropic support - Suspected confirmed CAD Maintain heart rate 50 - 60 bpm range RV volume overload Preload reduction RV pressure overload Pulmonary afterload reduction Standard Medical Care Step 4 : Ongoing intra-operative assessment Based appropriate EGAM strategy define Step 3 , either TEE TTE use surgical procedure ongoing patient assessment every 15 20 minute . The PI Secondary Investigator determine whether TEE TTE conduct intra-operatively . The result test use research purpose . During surgery : fluid administration , afterload adjustment , support contractility implement optimize patient management . It difficult assess cardiac output current standard medical care without invasive monitoring . There minimal risk physician get distract echocardiogram algorithm study however unlikely tool would distraction physician monitoring patient . The randomization think due fact Urology/Gynecology/General surgical patient consent study specific demographic recruit inclusion criterion . Currently UNMC Urology/Gynecology surgical patient distribution lie 47 percent men 53 percent woman .</detailed_description>
