	<brief_summary>This research trial collect study tissue blood sample patient prostate bladder/urothelial cancer recur ( come back ) near place original ( primary ) tumor spread part body . Studying sample blood tissue sample patient prostate bladder/urothelial cancer laboratory may help doctor learn new biomarkers , potential drug target , resistance develop response treatment . It may also help doctor find good way treat cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting Studying Blood Tissue Samples From Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Prostate Bladder/Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain tissue tumor biopsy and/or surgical resection match blood sample patient localize metastatic prostate bladder/urothelial cancer : mutation map use OncoMap high throughput genotyping technology ; sequence tumor genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ; global assessment gene expression generate hypothesis test subsequent trial ( gene expression microarrays and/or complementary [ c ] DNA sequencing ; profile gene involve androgen metabolism DNA repair ; quantitating peptide , hormone locally-derived systemic metabolite present tumor tissue . II . Obtain sample control , include blood tissue comparison sample note . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether level androgen synthetic enzyme predict response agent target androgen-androgen receptor ( AR ) signal axis . II . Determine whether intratumoral androgen level increase compare serum level , whether correlate androgen synthetic enzyme level and/or response therapy . III . Determine whether time progression therapy correlate androgen biosynthetic enzyme hormone level . IV . Determine whether gene expression profile predict response time progression chemotherapy target agent . V. Identify immune B and/or T cell marker , sequence and/or antibody may correlate response , time progression and/or overall survival patient undergoing immunotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection blood tissue sample analysis via mutation mapping , DNA sequencing , gene expression microarray , gene profiling .</detailed_description>
