	<brief_summary>Procedures ablation persistent long last atrial fibrillation frequently long require extensive ablation . Some electrophysiologists administer drug ibutilide procedure help organize fibrillatory activity leave atrium hope may shorten length procedure duration ablation need . Currently standardize approach administer drug ibutilide procedure , thus investigator certain administering drug fact facilitate procedure . The aim MAGIC-AF Trial see administer standard dose drug ibutilide standard time procedure allow reduction ablation procedure time . The investigator hypothesize administer ibutilide procedure result reduction procedure ablation time require .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Definition : Patients persistent atrial fibrillation enrol trial . All patient require atrial fibrillation day procedure . Standard pulmonary vein ( PV ) isolation perform . Patients enrol trial remain atrial fibrillation bi-directional block obtain leave right side PVs . At point , patient randomize receive 0.25mg IV ibutilide placebo ( normal saline ) . Patients undergo additional ablation area complex fractionate electrograms ( CFE ) target . The duration additional CFE ablation use additional non-PV ablation ( i.e . placement linear lesion ) leave discretion operator . Patients follow 1 year . The primary outcome assess freedom AF 1 year .</detailed_description>
