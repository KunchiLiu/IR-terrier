	<brief_summary>Scientific Context High-risk type human papillomavirus ( HPV ) causative agent cervical cancer . Cervical cancer screen strategy rely periodic Papanicolaou ( Pap ) test . It 's well-known test significantly contribute reduction mortality morbidity due cervical cancer . In France , seem screen strategy could optimize . The two main way reach 7 million underscreened woman ( mass screening , self-sampling HPV DNA test ) improve screen test ( HPV DNA test , computer-assisted cytology ) . Self-collected vaginal sample ( SCVS ) HPV DNA test could relevant screen option : technique appear reliable could allow reach woman never seldom screen . Currently , French data SCVS HPV DNA test . The goal study determine performance acceptability population-based strategy use self-collected vaginal sample HPV DNA test reach woman participate cervical cancer screening . Description project This project ( APACHE-1 ) part project call APACHE . APACHE-1 dedicated SCVS technical validation comparison different transport medium . Nine hundred woman recruit 20 65 year consultant Tours University Hospital ( CHRU Tours ) IRSA ( health centre routine medical checkup ) . Each woman collect 2 SCVS nylon flock swab ( Copan® microRheologics™ ) . The first SCVS put vial contains liquid medium . The second SCVS put dry vial . Then speculum examination physician collect cervical sample Rovers® Cervex-Brush™ rinse vial contain PréservCyt ™ . A blind HPV DNA test genotyping ( Inno-LIPA HPV Genotyping ™ Extra ) perform virology laboratory CHRU Tours sample ( SCVSs cervical sample perform physician ) . The performance SCVS detect cervical HPV infection assess ( gold standard test = HPV DNA test cervical sample collect physician ) . In second time ( APACHE-2 ) , researcher investigate extent offering home obtain SCVS lead participation unscreened woman . APACHE-2 registered Clinicaltrials another project .</brief_summary>
