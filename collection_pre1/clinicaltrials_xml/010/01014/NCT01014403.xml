	<brief_summary>Brain injured patient high risk form blood clot legs lung . For non-brain injured trauma patient , decrease chance blood clot form place patient low dose blood thinner enoxaparin . Starting patient brain injury blood thinner problematic , however , theoretically cause brain injury worsen . Trauma surgeon wait variable period time start blood thinner wait long result formation blood clot legs lung . Previous research show brain injury low severity enoxaparin start 24 hour injury brain injury stable repeat computed tomography ( CT ) scan head . This pilot study design look rate worsen brain injury low dose blood thinner start 24 versus 96 hour post-injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed Versus Early Enoxaparin Prophylaxis After Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct placebo-controlled non-inferiority pilot study evaluate rate worsen intracranial injury pattern initiation enoxaparin TBI patient . Patient enrollment occur ETMC , blind re-reading CTs occur PMH , administrative/analytical support occur UTSW . The study design double-blind , randomize control trial ETMC Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( SICU ) consist 40 patient per arm . The decision 80 patient resource-based , pilot study . Further , anticipate need contact 3 patient order obtain 1 successful recruitment . Each arm consist low-risk TBI patient ( defined patient subdural epidural hematoma &lt; 8mm , intraparenchymal contusion &lt; 2 cm , and/or single contusion per lobe ) CT scan head without contrast 24 hour post-injury document stable injury pattern . The severity neurologic deficit bearing suitability participation , consider inclusion/exclusion criterion . After documentation stable intracranial injury pattern time interval , patient randomize receive either enoxaparin 30 mg SQ every 12 hour placebo regimen initiate 24 hour post-injury . A follow-up CT scan brain without contrast obtain patient 48 hour post-injury ( 24 hour initiation enoxaparin/placebo ) . An additional CT scan brain without contrast obtain patient experience abrupt change neurologic exam time initiation enoxaparin/placebo end study 's interventional period 96 hour post-injury ( time frame choose early time point universal agreement among group 's practitioner enoxaparin use safe risk TBI expansion ) . Any patient worsen CT scan investigational treatment discontinue time . At 96 hour post-injury , interventional portion study end , data collection primary endpoint cease , patient place enoxaparin remainder hospital stay per local standard care . Patient participation study last time injury 96 hour post-injury interventional part study , 96 hour post-injury discharge ETMC observational portion . While latter time frame obviously extremely variable , average approximately one two week . During interventional observational time period , patient Duplex ultrasonography low extremity perform edematous extremity , CT-angiography chest unexplained hypoxia tachycardia , ventilation-perfusion scan suspicion PE presence contraindication IV contrast .</detailed_description>
