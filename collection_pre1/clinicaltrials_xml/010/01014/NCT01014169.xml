Even doodle show lead improve memory aid concentration [ 6 ] . Interestingly , patient family note take retention medical information extensively study . A number study do look intervention improve delivery health information retention information provide . Randomized control trial look impact specific train program provider [ 7 ] practice-wide change office system [ 8 ] , show improvement amount quality guidance provide .
