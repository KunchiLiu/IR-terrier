	<detailed_description>Objectives : Chronic physical inactivity contributes deaths nearly 1 10 Americans . In senior , single common life-threatening disease congestive heart failure patient , abnormality diastolic function play critical role pathophysiology disease . The sponsor 's research demonstrate healthy sedentary age lead atrophy stiffen heart reduce myocardial chamber compliance . In contrast , highly competitive senior runner cardiac compliance indistinguishable healthy young individual suggest lifelong exercise training prevent stiffening . However , prolong intense exercise training ( 4-6 hrs/wk 1 yr ) fail restore cardiac compliance healthy senior despite health benefit . Why year training fail restore cardiac compliance ? New evidence suggest structural plasticity myocardial cell elderly may functionally constrain accumulation toxic metabolite call advanced glycation end-products ( AGEs ) . AGEs array protein non-enzymatically cross-linked sugar ; array increase stiffness arterial wall myocardium . Investigators recently develop drug capable cleave AGE cross-link . Termed ALT-711 , drug show safe human study vary degree efficacy endpoint blood pressure non-invasive index diastolic function . Based animal study , hypothesize AGE cross-link must break meaningful improvement cardiac compliance occur exercise training sedentary senior . Hypothesis : We hypothesize AGE cross-link must break meaningful improvement cardiac compliance occur exercise training previously sedentary senior ; combination AGE cross-link breaker , ALT-711 , exercise training superior either intervention alone improve cardiac compliance subject . Specific Aim : To test hypothesis , study four group previously sedentary senior subject one year follow intervention : A ) sedentary control take placebo ; B ) sedentary subject take ALT-711 ; C ) subject undergoing moderate intensity exercise training take placebo D ) subject undergoing moderate intensity exercise training take ALT-711 . A comprehensive set `` Baseline Testing '' ( prior one year intervention ) `` Follow-up Testing '' ( one year intervention ) take place assess effect intervention . This test include submaximal maximal exercise test well comprehensive invasive ( right heart catheterization ) non-invasive ( ultrasound , MRI ) measure cardiac mechanic , relaxation morphology . From data , follow index diastolic systolic function generate : Starling pressure/volume curve ; calculation LV wall stress strain ; measurement flow propagation velocity , ejection fraction relaxation velocity . In assess risk benefit ratio study , major benefit include : 1 ) obtain meaningful information society regard effect ALT-711 moderate intensity exercise training compliance leave ventricular chamber ; 2 ) obtain important information subject regard ambulatory blood pressure , exercise performance , cardiac morphology cardiac function ; 3 ) provide subject one year supervise moderate intensity exercise training yoga training , associate health benefit . The risk study primarily impose dose investigational drug , favorable side effect profile , placement peripherally insert right heart catheter , carry minimal risk place experienced cardiovascular specialist catheterization lab . Hence , final analysis , feel benefit enrol individual society far outweigh risk participation .</detailed_description>
