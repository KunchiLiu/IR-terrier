	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Frequently Modified Intensive Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin treatment mainstay Type-1 diabetic management one cornerstones Type-2 diabetes . This treatment base multiple daily injection different type insulin . Patients follow endocrinologist ' direction adhere set recommend dosage formula , calculate repeat blood glucose measurement . In order maintain effective safe management , glucose measurement take meal bedtime , albeit impose heavy financial burden patient support system . For illustration , disposable glucosemeter strip cost dollar need replace routinely 4 time daily , yield annual cost $ 1500 per patient . Insulin dosages necessitate repeat adjustment meet patient 's change need . Variations food intake , body weight , physical activity , go medical condition mood impact patient 's insulin need . Accordingly , diabetic clinic appointment , endocrinologist review patient 's glucose measurement insulin dose determine whether insulin dosage need adjust . Unfortunately , limited appointment availability restrict insulin dosage adjustment every several month . Furthermore , result limited time allot patient , new dose recommendation base review recent measurement . This drawback may one chief cause suboptimal management , merely 38 % diabetic patient able achieve proper control mitigate detrimental complication . Since discovery insulin Frederick Grant Banting 1921 , stringent glucose control regimen multiple insulin injection prevent microvascular macrovascular complication Type 1 diabetic patient . Moreover , insulin treatment amongst treatment modality show prevent microvascular macrovascular complication Type-2 diabetic patient . Incidentally , Type-2 diabetic epidemic expands , insulin treatment become one main treatment modality . Not take consideration availability , establish frequent patient-clinic interaction improve diabetic management Type-1 Type-2 patient . In typical 3-6 month interval appointment , endocrinologist would measure patient 's hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) determine quality last 3 month control . This value , linearly correlate mean glucose level 3 month period , therefore , predict accord measurement . We use anonymous record glucose measurement perform preliminary statistical analysis . Our result indicate patient 's glucose level highly non-stationary process , strong variation mean standard deviation ( SD ) one week another . In many patient excessive HbA1c , level diabetic complication likely ensue , endocrinologist obligate adjust insulin dosage base review patient 's recent glucose value value past several week . Furthermore , since appointment time random independent patient 's measurement , random trend glucose value may identify lead different conclusion . For illustration , patient 's appointment happen occur glucose value randomly trend , endocrinologist may choose increase insulin dos . On hand , appointment occurs time glucose level trend , may act oppositely . The required frequency follow-up dose adjustment yield well patient control yet determine . Studies show case management patient Type-2 diabetes allow good control HbA1c level . These study involve use qualified medical professional ( ie , nurse , pharmacist , physician 's assistant ) intervention method , well provide counsel follow-up call help patient improve self-management diabetes . This study design show weekly insulin dosage adjustment intensive insulin therapy superior conservative , infrequent adjustment clinical appointment Type-1 Type-2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
