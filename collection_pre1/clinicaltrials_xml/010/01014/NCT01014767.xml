	<brief_summary>This `` tissue banking data review '' research study also `` clinical '' research part : - The goal tissue bank part study store tissue research tissue bank International Society Pediatric Oncology ( SIOP ) international reference center choroid plexus tumor . The tissue use future research related cancer . - The goal data review part study collect information medical record patient choroid plexus tumor , store information SIOP databases use future research related cancer . - The goal clinical research study compare 4 chemotherapy treatment choroid plexus tumor . The safety level effectiveness study treatment compare study . The study drug include different combination etoposide , carboplatin , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , doxorubicin , cisplatin , dactinomycin , temozolomide , irinotecan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intercontinental Multidisciplinary Registry Treatment Optimization Study Choroid Plexus Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue Banking : If agree , sample leftover tissue ( left standard care procedure ) store research tissue bank SIOP use future research related cancer . Data Collection : If agree , data medical record send SIOP . The data store secure research databases SIOP use future research related cancer . One plan use databases learn many patient choroid plexus tumor , type choroid plexus tumor patient , result treatment different type choroid plexus tumor . Other Information : Before tissue and/or data send SIOP storage , name personal identifying information cod protect privacy . SIOP access code link data identity . Tufts Medical CEnter oversight leftover tissue and/or data store SIOP additional research . Length Study : You on-study long agree continue tissue and/or data use research . This investigational study . Up 190 patient take part study . Up 6 enrol M. D. Anderson . Clinical Research : The Study Drugs : The study drug design interfere growth cancer cell block cell division , may cause cell die . Radiation Therapy : Participants eligible may also receive radiation therapy study . The type therapy `` craniospinal '' radiation ( radiation brain spinal cord ) `` focal '' radiation ( radiation focus tumor ) . This doctor 's decision , radiation doctor discus treatment option possibly eligible . Surgery : Participants eligible may also surgery study . This tumor remain therapy certain time study , tumor surgically remove . This doctor 's decision , study doctor discus treatment option possibly eligible . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) study group . This study do 2 phase . If one first participant join study , enrol Phase I . There 4 study group Phase I , equal chance assign 4 group . If one later participant join study , enrol Phase II . There 2 study group Phase II , equal chance assign either group . - One study group Phase II receive study drug call `` Group 1 '' . ( Although none study drug FDA-approved , Group 1 's study drug consider standard treatment choroid plexus tumor . ) - The study group Phase II study group Phase I best result ( Group 2 , 3 , 4 described ) . The study drug Cycles 1 2 different 4 study group . All 4 study group receive study drug Cycles 3-6 . Cycles study 28 day long . Study Drug Administration : Group 1 : - In Cycle 1 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 2 hour Days 2 3 , etoposide vein 1 hour Days 1-5 , vincristine vein 15 minute Day 5 . - In Cycle 2 , Group 1 receive etoposide vein 1 hour Days 1-5 , carboplatin vein 2 hour Days 2 3 , vincristine vein 15 minute Day 5 . Group 2 : In Cycles 1 2 , Group 2 receive doxorubicin vein 12 hour Days 1-3 , dactinomycin vein 1 hour Day 1 , cisplatin vein 6 hour Day 4 , vincristine 15 minute Days 8 15 . Group 3 : Group 3 receive methotrexate vein 24 hour Days 1 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 . Group 4 : In Cycles 1 2 , Group 4 take temozolomide mouth day Days 1-5 receive irinotecan vein 1 hour Days 1-5 . All Groups : - In Cycles 3 5 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 2 hour Days 2 3 , etoposide vein 1 hour Days 1-5 , vincristine vein 15 minute Day 5 . - In Cycles 4 6 , receive etoposide vein 1 hour Days 1-5 , carboplatin vein 2 hour Days 2 3 , vincristine vein 15 minute Day 5 . - Depending doctor 's decision , drug receive vein may give central venous catheter . This sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , sign separate consent form . Possible Additional Therapies : Depending age disease status , may receive radiation therapy Cycle 3 . The radiation treatment day , minute , 5 day week 6 week . If tumor remain Cycle 1 , radiation therapy , and/or last study drug dose , may surgery tumor surgically remove . Your doctor explain surgery detail , sign separate consent form . Possible Different Type Etoposide Administration : If tumor cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid brain spine ) receive craniospinal radiation , receive etoposide `` intrathecally '' rather vein . This mean drug give directly cerebrospinal fluid . This do Days 1 28 every cycle . Your doctor explain intrathecal injection procedure detail , sign separate consent form . In case , etoposide may ( depend doctor 's decision ) give Ommaya reservoir Rickham capsule . These device surgically place scalp drug give directly cerebrospinal fluid . If applies , surgeon explain surgery detail , sign separate consent form . Drugs Prevent Side Effects : On day receive cyclophosphamide , receive mesna 4 time vein 15 minute ( , 3 time cyclophosphamide infusion ) . On day receive etoposide , may ( need ) receive diphenhydramine vein 15 minute mouth . Group 3 receive leucovorin vein 15 minute , 42 hour start methotrexate dose , every 6 hour methotrexate longer body . If white blood cell count become low , may ( need ) receive filgrastim injection skin . Study Visits : The study visit follow standard schedule test procedures do connection chemotherapy . At least week , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If Group 3 , blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon time ) pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test start 24 hour every methotrexate dose . This blood test repeat every 6 hour doctor decide methotrexate level reach certain low level . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Length Study : You may receive study drug 6 cycle . You take study drug early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test liver kidney function . - You hear test . - You magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . Long-Term Follow-Up : Once study , receive long-term follow-up , accord standard care brain tumor . Other Instructions : Before take study drug , sure tell doctor : - ever unusual allergic reaction study drug - type infection ( bacterial , viral , fungal ) - form heart , kidney , liver , stomach , intestinal , lung disease - gout For safety reason , take study drug : - Do take form aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen , pain reliever unless study doctor approves . - Do alcohol ( beer , wine , liquor ) . - Do receive vaccine unless study doctor approves . - Avoid contact people recently take polio vaccine mouth . This investigational study . None study drug FDA-approved treat choroid plexus tumor . They investigational use . Intrathecal etoposide FDA approve commercially available . At time , intrathecal etoposide use research . Except intrathecal etoposide , study drug FDA-approved commercially available use type cancer : - Etoposide vein - lung cancer - Carboplatin - ovarian cancer - Cisplatin - testicular cancer - Vincristine - leukemia - Cyclophosphamide - lymphoma - Methotrexate - leukemia - Doxorubicin - breast cancer - Dactinomycin - kidney cancer ( Wilm 's tumor ) - Temozolomide - glioma ( type brain cancer ) - Irinotecan - colon cancer Up 190 patient take part multicenter study . Up 6 enrolled Tufts Medical Center .</detailed_description>
