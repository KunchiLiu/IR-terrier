	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine feasibility deliver PBI lumpectomy perform . By administer PBI lumpectomy , small volume breast tissue may expose radiation . The PBI method use study 3D ( three dimensional ) conformal external beam irradiation . 3D-conformal external beam irradiation use x-ray beam deliver radiation dose . Approximately 3 week completion PBI , cancer surgically remove . This study learn good bad effect 3D-conformal external beam irradiation PBI give cancer remove lumpectomy . The study also learn feeling woman breast look PBI surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation ( APBI ) Women With Stage I Select IIA Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate feasibility , cosmetic result , complication rate , local control rate 3D-CRT confine region lumpectomy cavity patient Stage I IIa ( less equal 3 cm ) carcinoma breast ( non-lobular histology ) treat APBI use 3D-CRT lumpectomy . For select patient Stage I II breast carcinoma , 3D-CRT deliver primary tumor preoperatively technically reproducible acceptable complication rate . Cosmetic result partial breast irradiation lumpectomy comparable obtained whole breast external beam radiation therapy . The local tumor control rate breast partial breast irradiation therapy follow lumpectomy comparable conventional external beam radiation therapy , less inconvenience potentially less cost patient , give selection criterion minimize risk clinically significant multicentric extensive residual carcinoma follow lumpectomy .</detailed_description>
