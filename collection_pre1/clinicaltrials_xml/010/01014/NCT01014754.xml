	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine causative associate factor development Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis ( NSF ) , Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy ( NFD ) , related diagnosis . Our primary focus previous administration gadolinium patient , also look postulated cause risk factor . The secondary objective study assess tissue gadolinium ( Gd ) level five group subject : - Those affected NSF . - Those normal kidney function undergone medical imaging procedure use Gd-based contrast agent ( GBCA ) 2 year prior skin biopsy . - Those normal kidney function never expose GBCA skin biopsy . - Those dialysis eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 medical imaging procedure use GBCA 2 year prior skin biopsy . - Those dialysis eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 never expose GBCA skin biopsy . We hypothesize correlation administration Gd-containing agent usually associate MRI procedure development NSF renal failure predispose condition . We also hypothesize tissue Gd level NSF high expose GBCA NSF . Of two group without NSF exposure GBCA , hypothesize kidney dysfunction high tissue Gd level normal kidney function . We hypothesize two group subject without exposure GBCA , detectable level Gd , regardless kidney function status .</brief_summary>
