	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Chronic Stroke Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We test effectiveness stimulation condition : 1 ) anodal lesional motor cortex 2 ) anodal PMD ( positive electrode dorsal premotor cortex ( PMD ) lesional hemisphere ( first phase ) dual motor cortex stimulation ( second phase ) , 3 ) cathodal contralesional motor cortex , 4 ) sham double blind crossover design chronic cortical subcortical stroke . Persons chronic stage recovery stroke ( &gt; 3 month ) receive type tDCS stimulation 20 minute concurrent physical therapy treatment ( 90 minute ) utilize Armeo Â® , gravity neutral arm exercise support system involve upper extremity provide task practice virtual reality environment , follow therapist supervise targeted hand exercise . The experimental protocol alter standard care , perform standard rehabilitation complete . The experimental therapy part standard care charge reimburse patient ' insurance . Participation free charge subject . We plan perform study two phase . In first exploratory phase , conduct short pilot study 15 subject optimize possible simplify treatment parameter second long phase experiment . In first phase perform one four different tDCS stimulation condition concurrently physical therapy protocol therapy day , subject receive stimulation type randomize counterbalanced order . There 1 day rest period session , make 9 day ( 10 day initial evaluation do day 1st treatment ) total commitment time first phase study . The outcome measure collect session . The outcome measure collect 1 day rest provide baseline next session also use validate stability treatment effect . Subjects participate first part study offer option participate second long phase study . ( please see table study procedure ) In second phase experiment perform promise stimulation paradigm plus sham first part experiment random , counterbalance order 30 chronic stroke subject . If initial phase difference find stimulation type cortical v subcortical patient group 3 stimulation paradigm perform second phase . Based preliminary data , perform follow paradigms second phase : 1 ) sham 2 ) dual stimulation 3 ) optimize tDCS randomize counterbalanced order . The optimized tDCS determine test session prior first treatment tDCS montage produce best behavioral response use therapy . Subjects perform IRB approve study # STU 102013-085 . The patient time commitment second phase 18 week , subject 3 x 1 week long treatment ( 5 weekday ) session 5 week inter-treatment `` rest period '' . The blinded tester perform final outcome evaluation 5 week end last session . ( please see table study procedure ) Total number potential enrol subject phase approximately 45 [ Phase 1 ( 15 ) + Phase 2 ( 30 ) ] . The stepwise design enable u optimize study time commitment expense patient researcher maximize clinical/scientific gain .</detailed_description>
