	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose cisplatin treat patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer tumor spread start lung ( metastasis ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving cisplatin directly arteries around tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity cisplatin deliver selectively isolated lung suffusion patient biopsy cytologically prove resectable unresectable primary secondary malignancy lung . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess lung tissue level cisplatin isolate lung suffusion function dose deliver . II . To evaluate systemic pulmonary artery concentration cisplatin isolated lung suffusion . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive cisplatin intra-arterially via isolated lung suffusion 2 hour . Beginning approximately 2 week later ( 6-8 week indicate patient sarcoma undergoing surgery cisplatin ) , patient receive standard chemotherapy regimen . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 90 day .</detailed_description>
