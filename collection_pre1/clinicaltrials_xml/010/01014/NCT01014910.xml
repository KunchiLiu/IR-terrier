	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) syndrome cause different type virus occurs young child . Although bronchiolitis widespread fairly common illness child , pediatrician vary significantly treat . This include child monitor oxygen status receive supplemental oxygen . Studies suggest continuous pulse oximetry measurement child admit hospital bronchiolitis regardless use supplemental oxygen prolongs hospital stay . This increase cost care patient increase risk hospital-associated complication . This study randomize trial continuous pulse oximeter use patient admit bronchiolitis versus transition patient require oxygen intermittent pulse oximetry monitoring . The investigator hypothesize decrease length stay well associate cost care number medical intervention perform hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Versus Continuous Pulse Oximetry Monitoring Infants Admitted Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Bronchiolitis low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) syndrome cause different virus . It common LRTI child 24 month old , account approximately 90,000 hospitalization annually cost $ 700 million child 12 month . Health care provider vary diagnosis management , however . In 2006 American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) release guideline bronchiolitis management effort standardize clinical practice . Part guideline recommend patient admitted hospital receive supplemental oxygen persistently hypoxic , define pulse oximeter reading persistently 90 % . However , recommendation base expert opinion . Research previously show healthy infant routinely experience brief episode decrease oxygen level sleep without significant health effect . Other study demonstrate relationship short interval transient mildly decrease oxygen level long-term mental developmental delay . Furthermore , child bronchiolitis remain hospitalized long without appreciable improvement course outcome illness continuously monitor oxygen level . Widespread pulse oximeter use increase hospitalization rate 250 % , close monitoring increase length stay child otherwise could discharge home . The 2006 guideline discourage continuous pulse oximetry monitoring child require supplemental oxygen , health care provider routinely ignore recommendation . No study assess impact strictly adhere practice recommend AAP . Research Procedures : This randomize control study multi-site collaboration University Missouri Children 's Hospital Columbia , Missouri . Children admit study site bronchiolitis batch randomize ( i.e . randomize separately site ) undergo either continuous pulse oximetry monitoring throughout entire hospitalization receive intermittent monitoring supplemental oxygen . Patients additionally receive care standard management illness . Of note , propose intervention recommend standard care oxygen monitoring compare general practice use study site . Researchers review chart discharge length stay , number medical intervention perform , diagnostic testing complete , treatment provide . Cost stay patient group estimate compare well . Patients involve study entire admission .</detailed_description>
