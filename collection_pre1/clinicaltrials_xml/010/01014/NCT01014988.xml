	<brief_title>Safety Study Assess IV Zanamivir Treatment Influenza Infection Patients Who Are Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label , Phase II , multi-center , single arm study evaluate safety tolerability IV zanamivir 600mg twice daily 5 day hospitalize subject laboratory confirm influenza infection . The initial 5-day treatment course may extend 5 additional day viral shed determined ongoing clinical symptom warrant treatment IV zanamivir . Approximately 200 subject enrol study ( approximately 150 adult/adolescent subject approximately 50 pediatric subject ) . Adult ( &gt; /= 18 year age ) normal renal function receive 600mg per dose . Pediatric ( 6 month &lt; 13 year ) /adolescent ( &gt; 13 year &lt; 18 year ) subject receive age-adjusted , weight-based dose ( exceed 600 mg adult dose ) intend provide comparable systemic exposure 600mg adult . Subjects renal impairment receive adjust dose base calculated creatinine clearance renal replacement modality . Serum pharmacokinetic assessment perform subject across age group wherever possible . Pharmacokinetic analysis conduct , real-time extent possible , 4 subject ( sample obtain ) enrol follow age cohort : 6 month less 1 year ; 1 less 2 year , 2 less 6 year determine need pediatric dose adjustment . PK assessment require first 4 subject enrol 6 month less 1 year age cohort , PK data must analyze IV zanamivir dosage must review additional subject age cohort enrol . The study duration approximately 28 day subject whose treatment duration 5 day , approximately 33 day subject whose treatment duration extend maximum 10 day . The study consist Pre-dose Baseline Assessments ( Day 1 ) , During Treatment Assessments ( Days 1 5 , Day 10 ) , Follow-up Assessments follow day : Post-Treatment +2 +5 , +9 , +16 +23 Days . If first dose IV zanamivir administer afternoon/evening Day 1 , twice daily dose schedule result one treatment day encompass two calendar day . For subject discharge hospital , Post-Treatment +2 , +5 , +9 +16 Days Assessments make telephone contact .</detailed_description>
