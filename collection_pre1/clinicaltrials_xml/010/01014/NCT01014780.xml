	<brief_summary>The aim investigation determine thickness human preocular tear film use new method base laser speckle . This preliminary study generate `` normative '' tear film thickness data normal ( i.e. , non dry eye ) dry eye subject clinic-based population . In addition , examine short term ( i.e. , one week ) repeatability method single setting . The patient classify dry eye also tear film thickness measure instillation artificial tear . This potentially reveal valuable data retention effect measure non-invasively prior study employ fluorescein tracer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tear Film Thickness Measured Using Novel Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We generate `` normative '' tear thickness data normal ( i.e. , dry ) dry eye human subject . We examine short-term repeatability method , examine influence tear thickness viscous eyedrop instill eye .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>There requirement subject race , gender occupation . If subject question concern regard inclusion exclusion criterion , encourage ask either investigator ( Dr. Paugh Dr. Kwan ) clarification . All subject must meet following criterion : 1 . The informed consent document must read , sign date subject conducting procedure . Additionally , informed consent document must sign date individual obtain consent subject . HIPAA authorization must also sign date subject . 2 . Adult subject , 18 year age old . Criteria mild severe dry eye group must include two three follow characteristic demonstrated Eligibility visit : 1 . Composite symptom score ≥ 7 Schein questionnaire : 2 . Sodium fluorescein ( NaFl ) tear breakup time ≤ 7 second either ( bad ) eye 3 . Cumulative sodium fluorescein ( NaFl ) corneal stain ≥ 4 either ( bad ) eye 020 point scale ( correspond ≥ 3.0 015 scale ) . 3 . Able willing follow study instruction . 4 . Willing return repeatability visit within 7 plus minus 2 day initial visit , within onehalf day ( i.e. , either morning afternoon , similar first tear thickness visit ) . 5 . Subjects must best correct visual acuity 20/25 good eye assess use standard Snellen acuity chart . 6 . Subjects wear soft contact lenses must willing discontinue wear two day study visit . 7 . Subjects use topical drop artificial tear must willing discontinue use drop two day prior visit , include baseline visit . Subjects demonstrate medical condition may affect result study SHOULD NOT enrol . The follow specific condition exclude subject enrollment study : 1 . History evidence ocular intraocular surgery either eye within past six month . LASIK keratorefractive procedure patient qualify recent surgery enhancement 12 month prior . 2 . History evidence serious ocular trauma either eye within past six month . 3 . History hypersensitivity sodium fluorescein . 4 . History evidence epithelial herpes simplex keratitis ( dendritic keratitis ) ; vaccinia , active recent varicella , viral disease cornea and/or conjunctiva ; chronic bacterial disease cornea and/or conjunctiva ; mycobacterial infection eye ; and/or fungal disease eye . 5 . Patients require use topical ocular medication glaucoma allergy medication study period . 6 . Individuals use systemic steroid , immunosuppressive agent and/or anticholinergic ( e.g . cold allergy medication , tricyclic antidepressant ) treatment autoimmune connective tissue disease may enrol study stable dose regimen minimum 30 day prior first visit . In addition , dose regimen must remain stable throughout study period , expect approximately one week . 7 . Individuals diabetes . 8 . Ocular condition conjunctival infection , iritis . 9 . Individuals wear rigid gas permeable contact lenses use punctal plug . 10 . Participation investigational drug device study within 30 day enter study .</criteria>
