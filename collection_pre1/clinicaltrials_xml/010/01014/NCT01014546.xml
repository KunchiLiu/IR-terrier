	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose arsenic trioxide without ascorbic acid treat patient myelofibrosis . Drugs use chemotherapy , arsenic trioxide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving arsenic acid together ascorbic acid may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide With Without Ascorbic Acid Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety maximum tolerate dose oral arsenic trioxide without ascorbic acid subject myelofibrosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate incidence , severity , attribution treatment-emergent adverse event . II . To estimate rate complete major clinical-hematological response treatment arsenic trioxide ascorbic acid subject population measure International Working Group Myelofibrosis Research Treatment ( IWG-MRT ) response criterion . III . To measure arsenic trioxide level plasma patient treat without ascorbic acid protocol . IV . To estimate efficacy arsenic trioxide ascorbic acid subject myelofibrosis , determine reduction Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) V617F , JAK22T875N , mutation thrombopoietin receptor ( MPL515L/K ) allele frequency peripheral blood neutrophil . V. To examine effect treatment biological marker myeloproliferation , cytokine production hematopoietic stem cell mobilization . In particular , follow marker disease measure : cluster differentiation ( CD ) 34+ cell count peripheral blood measure cytofluorimetry , plasma vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-B ) , stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) , neutrophil elastase level commercial assay . VI . To examine single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) arsenic trioxide pathway subject myelofibrosis treat arsenic trioxide ascorbic acid . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study arsenic trioxide . Patients receive arsenic trioxide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) orange juice day 1-21 . Patients may also receive ascorbic acid PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 168 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 4 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
