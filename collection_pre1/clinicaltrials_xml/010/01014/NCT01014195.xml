	<brief_title>Risk Psychopathology Neurocognitive Impairment Leukemia Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Survival rate pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) exceed 80 % . With grow population long-term survivor come recognition considerable proportion experience one significant late effect . For child undergoing central nervous system ( CNS ) treatment , common late effect include neurocognitive impairment neurobehavioral problem . Although problem first manifest subtle difficulty attention process speed , evolve deficit high order brain function significantly impact functional skill subset long-term survivor . There currently method accurately identify patient great risk long-term behavioral neurocognitive problem . Through proposal , study plan utilize exist data collect acute treatment identify predictor long-term neurocognitive brain maturation outcome . The study also propose collect data attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) associate comorbidities , high order executive function , structural functional brain image survivor least 8 year age great 5 year diagnosis . All patient undergo single neurocognitive evaluation focus assessment high order executive function . Patients evaluate regularly schedule annual follow-up visit , health-related monitoring also occur . Parents participant ask complete questionnaire design assess family environment impact cancer diagnosis family function parent stress . Brain Imaging : To better demonstrate untoward treatment effect upon cortical brain development , quantitative MR image myelin integrity use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) cortical thickness assessment use high resolution volumetric image utilized . All patient also evaluate use functional MRI ( fMRI ) procedures rest state participation attention work memory task . fMRI DTI data de-identified analyzed MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston , Texas .</detailed_description>
