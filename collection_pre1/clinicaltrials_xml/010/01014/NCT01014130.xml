	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether radiotherapy give three large dos period two week ( hypofractionated radiotherapy ) effective standard radiotherapy patient non-small cell lung cancer spread beyond lung . Although surgery effective treatment early lung cancer , many patient fit enough operation . The alternative treatment surgery standard radiotherapy normally 'fractionated ' , give number small dos period week . Experience show many small treatment safer use large dos ( hypofractionation ) less risk damage normal tissue . Recent advance technology however result great accuracy reduction amount normal tissue affect radiation , risk hypo-fractionation damage normal tissue less concern . Initial result obtain hypo-fractionated radiotherapy early stage non-small cell lung cancer indicate may effective control cancer . However , never compare directly standard fractionation randomise trial , study aim determine hypo-fractionation effective , result longer life expectancy safe standard fractionation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiotherapy ( Stereotactic ) Versus Conventional Radiotherapy Inoperable Early Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicentre randomise phase III trial compare hypo-fractionated ( `` stereotactic ' ) radiotherapy conventional radiotherapy without chemotherapy patient inoperable stage 1 peripherally locate non-small cell lung cancer . The accepted standard care stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , , T1 T2 tumor metastasise regional lymph node , surgical resection . However , many patient lung cancer significant cardiovascular respiratory co morbidity render unfit operation . For patient , standard care radiotherapy - conventional fractionation ( ConRT ) administer 20-30 fraction period four six week . This reduce likelihood long term damage incidentally irradiate normal tissue compare non-fractionated treatment . Local failure method , varies considerably report range 6-70 % median value 40 % use current best practice inoperable NSCLC dose 60 Gy . Concomitant chemotherapy addition CF improve local progression free survival 16 % two year compare radiotherapy alone . Highly conformal hypo-fractionated image guide radiotherapy emerge technically complex method precision irradiation stage 1 NSCLC use dos higher biological effect achieve standard treatment technique . Although rate local control use hypo-fractionation appear great , risk serious late toxicity . However , recent evidence 54-57Gy deliver 3 fraction deliver safely excessive toxicity , provide tumour peripheral location , chest wall include high dose volume treatment plan highly conformal . Although hypo-fractionation condition appear tolerable , associate high level local control , result small number phase II trial regard sufficient evidence recommend standard care inoperable stage I NSCLC . This randomised phase III trial test whether highly conformal hypo-fractionated image guide radiotherapy peripherally locate inoperable T1 T2a NSCLC use dose 54 Gy three fraction result superior control disease primary site compare standard care consist conventionally fractionate radiotherapy without concomitant chemotherapy . Treatment summary : Investigational arm - radical radiotherapy total dose 54 Gy 3 fraction 18 Gy , deliver weekly day 0 , 7 14 maximum deviation +/- 2 day specify time allow . Conventional arm - radical radiotherapy total dose 60-66 Gy 30-33 daily 2 Gy fraction 6 week , without chemotherapy consist weekly carboplatin AUC 2 paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 .</detailed_description>
