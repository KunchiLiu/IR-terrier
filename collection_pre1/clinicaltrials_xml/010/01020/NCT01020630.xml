	<brief_summary>This trial conduct evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability SUNITINIB add-on therapy widely use second-line palliative FOLFIRI chemotherapy patient chemo-refractory advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma stomach low esophagus ( mGC ) . There clear scientific rationale use Sunitinib treat patient mGC . Despite recent therapeutic advance , median overall survival ( OS ) patient mG still â‰¤ 12 month . Therefore , new agent novel mechanisms action desperately need treatment patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer Treated With FOLFIRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In parallel effort front-line therapy , second-line protocol like irinotecan-based regimen establish clinical trial patient . As many patient still good performance status present low tumor burden failure first-line chemotherapy , clearly benefit second-line treatment . Sunitinib inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) involve tumor proliferation angiogenesis , specifically VEGFR , PDGFR , KIT , FLT-3 , RET . The VEGF pathway show significant factor metastatic gastric cancer . The safety efficacy Sunitinib single agent treatment mGC determine support propose clinical study FOLFIRI combination Sunitinib treatment patient mGC . Patients include trial suffer advance metastatic adenocarcinoma stomach low esophagus . They fail respond least one standard palliative first-line therapy ( base docetaxel and/or cisplatin plus 5-FU ) . Irinotecan/FA/5-FU determine one establish second-line treatment available patient . Taken together , treatment patient Sunitinib combine standard chemotherapy FOLFIRI offer chance benefit new innovative therapy acceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
