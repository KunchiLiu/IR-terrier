	<brief_summary>Rationale : Diagnostic procedure , positron emission tomography , use drug fluorine F 18-EF5 find oxygen tumor cell may help plan cancer treatment . Purpose : This clinical trial study fluorine F 18-EF5 positron emission tomography assess hypoxia patient newly diagnose stage I , stage II , stage III , stage IV squamous cell cancer oral cavity , oropharynx , larynx .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorine F 18 EF5 Positron Emission Tomography Assessing Hypoxia Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage I , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Head Neck Squamous Cell Cancer Oral Cavity , Oropharynx , Larynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed DescriptionPRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe patterns level 18F-EF5 Stage 1 - 4 de novo HNSCC oral cavity , oropharynx larynx . II . Determine whether 18F-EF5 PET image predictive patient outcome ( event-free survival ; EFS overall survival ; OS ) . III . Determine whether statistically significant prognostic relationship find correspond grant independent nodal status . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore relationship 18F-EF5 signal measure hypoxia ( serum OPN ; HIF1alpha protein expression ) , proliferation ( Ki67+ cells/high power field ( HPF ) ) , apoptosis radiation resistance ( pAkt expression ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo fluorine F 18-EF5 positron emission tomography imaging . Scans perform 180 minute follow injection . After completion study , patient follow 2-4 week 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
