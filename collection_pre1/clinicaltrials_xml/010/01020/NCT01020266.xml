	<brief_title>Neuroprotective Study Electroacupuncture Pretreatment Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart valve replacement surgery prove effective method treat regenerative rheumatic valve disease . Current study show cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) operation relate cerebral injury associate worse patient morbidity mortality elective valve replacement surgery . Recently , Electroacupuncture ( EA ) pretreatment prove produced cerebral protective effect mimic ischemic preconditioning animal model . However , evidence EA pretreatment improve clinical outcome mortality morbidity , still lack . The investigator perform randomize control study evaluate EA pretreatment improve outcome cardiac surgery . Purpose : The purpose study examine EA pretreatment decrease mortality postoperative cerebrovascular complication patient undergo cardiac surgery . The effect assess mortality , score neurological defect , post operative cognitive dysfunction stroke . Methods : Study patient randomize cardiac surgery EA pretreatment conventional cardiac surgery Department cardiovascular surgery , Xijing Hospital . EA pretreatment perform Baihui acupoint 30 min per day 5 consecutive day heart valve replacement surgeryï¼ŽPrimary study outcome cerebrovascular complication within 6 postoperative month . Secondary outcome include S-100B NSE blood level measure first 72 hour surgery follow-up , several cytokine , include TNF-a , IL-8 , IL-6 , IL-10 HMGB-1 blood level measure first 7 day surgery follow-up , cardiovascular haemodynamic parameter measure pulmonary artery catheter , length intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay length postoperative hospital stay .</detailed_description>
