	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS This study examine operational consequence training requirement implement subcutaneous hydration vs. standard intravenous hydration emergency department . B . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Emergency department across nation overcrowd . Emergency department visit hit new high 2005 , 115 million visit , increase 5 million visit previous year , 20 percent increase 10 year . During period number hospital EDs decrease 9 percent 4,176 3,795 . A consequence increase demand occur decrease capacity , accord American College Emergency Physicians 60 percent EDs report overcrowd force facility divert patient though 70 percent hospital report goal admit patient within two hour arrival emergency department , almost half group routinely fail . Overcrowding result delayed treatment , long patient wait time , overburden work staff , patient elopement , low throughput , also result increase medical error due overload significant legal financial risk . These issue lead number initiative , potentially profound 2007 Joint Commission requirement ( Leadership Standard , LD.3.15 ) require hospital leadership : '' … develop implement plan identify mitigate impediment efficient patient flow throughout hospital '' . Developing process procedure improve patient ﬂow EDs , improve efficiency reduce crowd party interest . One potential area improvement hydration patient . Twenty-five million Americans intravenous catheter place year represent significant commitment time , personnel , resource . Several system devise effective delivery injectable material body use intravenous system , suffer drawback include trauma associate intravenous needle placement swelling , infection limit , often compromise , placement site . Furthermore intravenous hydration delivery require , minimum , RN start IV also expect monitor rate perfusion ( Adequate end-organ perfusion best indicated urine output &gt; 0.5 1 mL/kg/h ) notify physician desire end-states obtain . In study Emergency Departments , process add significant time patient stay well increased error rate form either ration fluid run without replacement patient need urinate without Nurse record reach end-point . Improvement either rate hydration reduction trauma complication associate typical intravenous system benefit patient health care system . Healthcare develop new system hydration/medication delivery use Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase . Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase offer several advantage hydrate emergency department patient I.V . hydration method . These include unlimited placement site , ( provide psychological physiological benefit ) , rapid hydration , potentially administer lower-cost available ED personnel require IVs . However , new technology super-imposed old process frequently generate full potential new technology . Cars require paved highway system cell-phones require method uniquely identify individual call three dimensional space . Attempting implement Subcutaneous Hydration environment Emergency Department may find `` '' workflow dynamic skill effectively support new technology . It essential understand Emergency room function understand improve process , train use new technology appropriately address realize efficiency improve quality care . Following model EDs : D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This classic direct observation , workflow study endpoint ( potential ) time difference patient throughput , hydration occur via Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase vs. Intravenous method . We also capture difference patient staff satisfaction two hydration method . The satisfaction survey occur immediately part workflow observation . The study design employ Difference within Difference design relative difference patient throughput ( primary variable interest ) patient/staff satisfaction ( secondary variable interest various hydration/medication delivery system assess site . It relative difference measure site use aggregate analysis . This mitigate danger large variation site overwhelm difference treatment option within site . Since observational study , primarily workflow characteristic , ( could ) make determination appropriateness individual provider 's decision either initiate discontinue patient hydration . Approach Between three five Emergency Departments ( depend volume ) already approve Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase formulary include study . Following UCSD ( relevant participate organization ) IRB approval , UCSD P.I . Project Coordinator coordinate identify administrative personnel research site regard nature study , provide introduction field observer , product study . In addition , site ask specific issue would like research team analyze fit within parameter study . Once clearance permission obtain , field observer orient individual facility introduce staff . Observations conduct follow manner , field staff observe ED patient record time enter facility . Once ED patient complete triage identified Acuity Level 3-5 , field staff approach ED patient offer opportunity participate observational study . If sign permission grant field staff `` shadow '' patient total ED visit use Observational Checklist Patient Encounters ( OCPE ) , publish Joint Commission . 15 It 52 item checklist capture three type data : 1 . Operational condition time encounter ( e.g . staff ratio X number patient ) 2 . Whether key procedure occur ( e.g . temperature take , pain assessment complete ) 3 . Time task completion ( e.g . long time image study order patient take image ) Patient satisfaction data collect part workflow observation . Secondary variable interest , specifically satisfaction assessment possible iatrogenic effect , occur conclusion observation . Patients directly survey satisfaction encounter . Preference item ( e.g . satisfaction provider ) use standard 5-point likert scale objective item ( e.g . `` care receive care expect , bruise around hydration site ) cast binary answer . Staff provider undergo similar direct survey satisfaction observation iatrogenic effect , though interview time-dependent patient satisfaction survey . Outcome Measures The data generate workflow observation satisfaction survey produce three distinct type data set analysis . The one primary interest study difference time sequence patient throughput Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase vs. Intravenous hydration method . This type data provide simple time-motion comparison , also frequently use generate measure efficiency ( i.e . many patient hydrate give unit time labor ) proficiency ( i.e . many patient correctly hydrate give unit time labor ) . Secondary outcomes interest include difference patient staff satisfaction , include perception iatrogenic effect , Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase Intravenous hydration method . The third data set include operational condition requisite effective use Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase use . Data Analysis Data preparation analysis follow standard statistical technique appropriate method use study . For example , McNemar test use determine significant change dichotomous variable error commission omission ( e.g. , IV fluid run , patient urinates without staff note ) . Paired-samples t-tests use determine significant difference discrete continuous variable ( e.g. , time require perform exam , time wait room ) ratio variable ( e.g. , patient/provider time time clinic , patient/provider time wait time exam room ) . Wilcoxon signed-rank test use determine significant change variable use Likert scale response option ( e.g. , provider , staff , patient satisfaction rating 5-point scale ) . Outcome measure efficiency , improve patient throughput increase adherence ED policy procedure , use traditional parametric efficiency calculation . Efficiency essentially much service provide correctly give unit time resource ( include personnel ) . Efficiency calculate use follow formula : Where : N = individual could hydrate PV = probability hydrate Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PHHR = probability hydration begin evaluate within time define protocol PD = probability hydration iatrogenic effect L = labor cost C = capital cost M = material cost Finally , data undergo Critical Path Analysis identify `` input '' operational factor control patient flow dynamic clinical outcome . This analysis use classification regression analysis use binary recursive partitioning identify variable greatest predictive ability correctly classify patient 's lengths stay ED .</detailed_description>
