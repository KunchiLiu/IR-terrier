	<brief_summary>Spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) long thought essential process extubation . In study , investigator hypothesize SBT could essential wean ventilator investigate whether wean could better do without spontaneous breathe trial non-COPD（COPD , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease） critically ill patient . This study reveal , first time , compare use SBT discontinue ventilator process , patient underwent successful extubation without SBT . For subset patient finding suggest SBT may exclude precede extubation general intensive care population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extubation With Without Spontaneous Breathing Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1000-bed primary teaching hospital , study conduct 8-bed adult general ICU course 13 month . All patient enrol study mechanically ventilate 48 hr via endotracheal tube study period . The investigation approve hospital ethic committee , inform write consent obtain next kin every patient . Patients ventilated pressure support ( PS ) entire weaning period . The level inspiratory PS positive end-expiratory pressure （PEEP ) progressively reduce depend patient 's clinical assessment blood gas value . Patients enrol study meet follow readiness criterion : show significant improvement resolution underlie cause acute respiratory failure ; fully awake ; require bronchial toilet less twice 4 hour proceed assessment ; stable hemodynamics without need vasoactive agent ; arterial oxygen tension ( PaO2 ) /fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) ratio &gt; 200 PEEP 4.0 cm H2O maximal FiO2 0.40 ; core temperature &lt; 38.0℃ ; systolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ; respiratory rate tidal volume ratio ( RVR ) &lt; 105 breaths/min/L . The RVR calculate 1 min spontaneous breathing.The maximal inspiratory PS 12 cm H2O mandatory machine breath supply ventilator . Study protocol The investigator investigate wean process without SBT . All patient continuously assess accord readiness criterion screen enrollment day . As soon patient ready weaning , randomly assign SBT no-SBT study group . Randomization carry blinded fashion use opaque seal envelope . All patient study breathe ventilator circuit flow-triggering ( 2L/min ) pressure support ventilation mode . In SBT group , patient underwent 1 hr SBT inspiratory PS 7 cmH2O setting remain constant ( FiO2 , PEEP , trigger sensitivity ) . For patient show poor tolerance SBT , full ventilation support immediately recommence . This define following failure criterion : decrease oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % ; respiratory rate &gt; 35/min 5 min , presence diaphoresis thoraco-abdominal paradox ; sustain increase heart rate ( &gt; 140/min ) , significant change systolic blood pressure ( &gt; 180 &lt; 90 mmHg ) . The patient tolerate SBT underwent immediate extubation receive ( breathe ) supplemental oxygen via facemask . In no-SBT group , soon patient meet readiness criterion , underwent extubation without SBT process receive supplemental oxygen via facemask . Following extubation , noninvasive ventilatory support introduce follow circumstance : hypoxemia ( SaO2 &lt; 90 % &gt; 15mins ) receive supplemental oxygen ; presence respiratory acidosis ( arterial PH &lt; 7.35 arterial carbon dioxide tension ( PaCO2 ) &gt; 45mmHg ; respiratory rate &gt; 25 breaths/min 1 hr . The mode ventilation Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure ( BiPAP ) . When support deem inadequate ( hypoxemia , hypercapnea , respiratory distress ) , patient reintubated mechanically ventilate . The SBT extubation perform two doctor member research team . Decisions regard reintubation make doctor blind treatment group . Extubation failure define reintubation within 48 hr . The reason reintubation prospectively record . Statistical Analysis Results express mean ± SD . Mean value select demographic variable physiologic parameter patient underwent SBT compare student 's test underwent extubation directly . The difference proportion two group determine use chi square test ( X2-test ) .</detailed_description>
