	<criteria>Subject chronic kidney disease Stage 3 4 determine estimate glomerular filtration rate ( 15 59 mL/min/1.73 m² ) Screening . Subject expect begin dialysis least 6 month ( opinion investigator ) . For entry Washout Period ( subject currently vitamin D receptor activator [ VDRA ] need complete 2 4 week washout ) , subject must satisfy follow criterion base Screening laboratory value : estimate glomerular filtration rate 15 59 mL/min/1.73 m² . iPTH measurement great equal 60 pg/mL ( Stage 3 subject ) great equal 90 pg/mL ( Stage 4 subject ) . An adjusted serum calcium value great equal 8.2 mg/dL ( 2.05 mmol/L ) less equal 10.5 mg/dL ( 2.63 mmol/L ) . A serum phosphorus value great equal 2.0 mg/dL ( 0.65 mmol/L less equal 6.0 mg/dL ( 1.94 mmol/L ) . For entry Treatment Phase ( vitamin D receptor activator naïve subject complete 4 week washout ) , subject must : iPTH measurement great equal 75 pg/mL ( Stage 3 subject ) great equal 110 pg/mL ( Stage 4 subject ) . An adjusted serum calcium value great equal 8.4 mg/dL ( 2.10 mmol/L ) less equal 10.2 mg/dL ( 2.55 mmol/L ) . A serum phosphorus value great equal 2.5 mg/dL ( 0.81 mmol/L ) less equal 5.8 mg/dL ( 1.87 mmol/L ) . Must 25hydroxyvitamin D level ≥ 30 ng/mL prior washout , VDRA naïve , treatment Part II study . All subject small bowel transplant exclude study . Subject acute kidney failure within 12 week Screening Phase ( define acute rise serum creatinine ) . Subject symptomatic significant hypocalcemia require active vitamin D therapy ( example , calcitriol , paricalcitol , doxercalciferol alfacalcidol ) within 6 month prior Screening Phase . Subject history active kidney stone ( 6 month prior screen ) . Subject chronic gastrointestinal disease , investigator 's opinion may cause significant gastrointestinal malabsorption . Subject take maintenance calcitonin , bisphosphonates , cinacalcet , glucocorticoid equivalent dose great 5 mg prednisone daily , drug know affect calcium bone metabolism within 4 week prior treatment .</criteria>
