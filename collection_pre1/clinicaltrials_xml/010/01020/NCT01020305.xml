	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Reverse Androgen Insensitivity Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) also know `` androgen-insensitive '' `` hormone-refractory '' prostate cancer . While numerous therapy impact biochemical response set CRPC , remain unmet medical need . New therapy extend survival patient beyond provide chemotherapy need . The mechanisms tumor progression castration-resistance unclear , preclinical study suggest functional loss tumor suppressor gene PTEN subsequent up-regulation Akt , upstream mTOR , may involve prostate cancer progression metastasis . Based observation , hypothesize mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus may prolong hormone sensitivity delay disease progression castration-resistant prostate cancer patient antiandrogen withdrawal . This study assess efficacy basis serum level PSA , establish surrogate endpoint efficacy prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
