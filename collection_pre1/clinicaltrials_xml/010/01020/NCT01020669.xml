	<brief_summary>Background : - Recent research suggest prenatal exposure drug may affect specific brain process , include work memory , stress response , decision making . However , research effect prenatal drug exposure human conduct early life , little known effect prenatal drug exposure crucial brain development period take place puberty adolescence . The biological psychological change associate puberty may increase adolescent ' sensitivity prenatal substance exposure . Researchers interested use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan study brain function learn effect prenatal drug exposure adolescent . Objectives : - To examine effect prenatal substance exposure work memory , decision making , normal brain activity adolescent . Eligibility : - Adolescents 12 17 year age enrol large follow-up study child expose drug utero . Design : - The study involve single outpatient session two fMRI scan test work memory decision-making process . - Participants brief medical history , physical examination , urine test drug abuse . - Participants train work memory decision-making task initial MRI scan provide baseline reading . - The fMRI scan take 40 45 minute , participant break need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective- To use fMRI compare brain activity rest work memory decision make task normal child child expose utero drug abuse . Study population- All participant 12-17 year-olds enrol ongoing longitudinal follow study child expose drug abuse utero fund NIH . A subgroup study cohort invite participate base add criterion need scan study , absence metal body , significant CNS disease , ability tolerate scan environment . Design- Participants undergo fMRI scan perform work memory task , decision make task rest . Data participant current study combine previous study ( NIDA protocol 417 ) reside repository protocol , 8002 . Outcome measures- The primary outcome measure difference BOLD fMRI activation drug-exposed participant without prenatal exposure drug abuse .</detailed_description>
