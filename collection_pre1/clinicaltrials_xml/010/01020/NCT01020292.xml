	<brief_summary>This phase I trial determine safety , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) protease inhibitor , Nelfinavir ( NFV ) , give chemoradiotherapy post-operative therapy glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Oral NFV standard therapy patient HIV safety 1250 mg BID NFV well-established . Case study also report HIV patient receive radiotherapy cancer , 1250 mg BID NFV . This first trial oral NFV chemoradiotherapy GBM patient . Although unacceptable toxicity unlikely , two NFV dose level ( 625 , 1250 mg BID ) evaluate cohort escalation design 3-6 subject . At MTD , 19 additional subject enrol generate pilot data radiographic response evaluate toxicity . A maximum 31 subject enrol trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Protease Inhibitor Nelfinavir Concurrent Radiation Temozolomide Patients With WHO Grade IV Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current therapy GBM GBM frequent primary malignant brain tumor adult . Prior introduction temozolomide , median survival generally less one year time diagnosis . Standard therapy consist surgical resection extent safely feasible , follow radiotherapy . Adjuvant carmustine , nitrosourea drug , commonly prescribe United States . Cooperative-group trial investigate addition various chemotherapeutic regimen radiotherapy randomize phase 3 trial nitrosourea-based adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate significant survival benefit compare radiotherapy alone . A metaanalysis base randomized trial suggest small survival benefit chemotherapy , compare Template Version : 7 May 2008 IRB APPLICATION page 1 8 radiotherapy alone ( 5 percent increase survival two year , 15 percent 20 percent ) . To improve survival rate , European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Brain Tumor Radiotherapy Groups , National Cancer Institute Canada ( NCIC ) Clinical Trials Group complete randomize , multicenter , phase III trial compare alkylating agent temozolomide radiotherapy radiotherapy alone patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . [ 1 ] A total 573 patient 85 center underwent randomization . At median follow-up 28 month , median survival 14.6 month radiotherapy plus temozolomide 12.1 month radiotherapy alone . The unadjusted hazard ratio death radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group 0.63 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.52 0.75 ; P0.001 log-rank test ) . The two-year survival rate 26.5 percent radiotherapy plus temozolomide 10.4 percent radiotherapy alone . Concomitant treatment radiotherapy plus temozolomide result grade 3 4 hematologic toxic effect 7 percent patient . Due landmark study , GBM patient good performance status typically treat concurrent radiation temozolomide follow adjuvant temozolomide . However , standard therapy still result median survival 14.6 month progression-free survival 6.9 month . Given low survival rate , new approach need . The addition molecularly-targeted therapy standard treatment approach merit investigation . GBM , Molecular Markers , Radiosensitization In GBM , PTEN mutations occur third patient EGFR EGFRvIII ( truncate EGFR ) amplification occur 40 % patient . These change show correlate poor prognosis . Over past decade EGFR Ras show modulate tumor radiosensitivity . EGFR number downstream effector include Ras PI3K . EGFR Ras-mediated radioresistance mediate , least part PI3K , phosphorylated Akt ( P-Akt ) good marker effect . We previously show head neck cancer P-Akt good predictor clinical response radiation . We others show block PI3K-Akt pathway enhances radiation response vitro vivo . Radiosensitization occur cell pathway constitutively activate occur cell ( normal tissue ) pathway activate . Inhibition pathway , therefore , promise approach radiation sensitization . One difficulty implement therapeutic strategy obtain mean block deregulate signal pathway patient . We find one class commonly use drug , HIV protease inhibitor ( HPIs ) interfere PI3K-Akt signal . These drug give combination reverse transcriptase inhibitor mainstay current therapeutic regimen HIV infect patient . The HPIs peptidomimetics inhibit HIV aspartyl protease , retroviral enzyme cleave viral gag-pol polyprotein necessary production infectious viral particle . One prominent side effect HPI treatment insulin resistance . Since Akt , play key role coordinate regulation growth metabolism insulin/IGFsignaling pathway , explore possibility HPIs might block PI3K-Akt signal axis tumor cell hence might use clinically radiation sensitizer . We test NFV find inhibited Akt concentration routinely achieve patient . NFV also sensitize tumor cell vitro vivo radiation . HPIs use continuously patient well-characterized pharmacokinetics . There report HIV patient protease inhibitor receive radiation therapy ; increase side effect radiation report clinical outcome may improve . In summary , clearly strong rationale proceed clinical trial NFV chemoradiation GBM : 1 . The prognosis GBM patient poor median survival 14.6 month best therapy . 2 . Preclinical work demonstrate NFV result regulation Akt signal cancer cell result radiation sensitization . 3 . There high frequency Akt activation GBM , link pathogenesis maintenance tumor . 4 . NFV show distribute brain tissue therapy likely increase brain penetrance fractionate radiotherapy disruption blood-brain-barrier may occur . 5 . NFV show sensitize normal tissue radiation . 6 . NFV safely administer HIV+ patient last decade minimal side effect .</detailed_description>
