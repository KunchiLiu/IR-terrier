	<brief_title>Combination SBRT With TACE Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) third deadly cancer world . It primarily see area hepatitis endemic , Asia , risk factor include alcoholic cirrhosis . Outcome disease poor , mostly due fact &gt; 80 % patient present unresectable disease . Surgery transplantation remain curative option . For vast majority patient unresectable , variety treatment option available , include transarterial chemo-embolization ( TACE ) , radiofrequency ablation , radioactive microspheres , microwave coagulation , laser-induced thermotherapy , percutaneous alcohol injection , similar survival rate . Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) unresectable HCC relatively new treatment option make available great improvement diagnostic image radiation delivery technique . Although follow-up limited , result show encouraging local control rate . Some investigator combine TACE fractionate radiotherapy mean intensify local therapy , evidence benefit . TACE remain dominant mode local therapy unresectable HCC . However , recurrence rate high . The recent randomized trial suggest combination local therapy ( TACE radiofrequency ablation [ RFA ] ) superior either therapy alone , provide proof principle combine local treatment likely effective HCC . Because SBRT rapidly become accept local therapy hepatic lesion , role treat HCC need define . Studies combine TACE external beam radiotherapy show encouraging result , logical next step combine TACE SBRT , delivers radiobiologically intensive dose radiation . However , toxicity data lacking , since combination previously report . We propose conduct trial trans-arterial chemo-embolization ( TACE ) SBRT unresectable HCC .</detailed_description>
