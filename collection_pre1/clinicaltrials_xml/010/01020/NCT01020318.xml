However , biological neurological reason TBI remain poorly understood need in-depth study . - The National Institutes Health collaborate several military medical center research unit multi-year study TBI civilian military patient . In anticipation research project , Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department need become familiar instrument likely need evaluate group subject . Objectives : - To evaluate potential test instrument patient TBI . - To evaluate patient tolerance extensive battery assessment time required complete assessment . - To improve staff competency new novel assessment TBI patient population Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose traumatic brain injury past 5 year . - Healthy volunteer 18 year age old instance significant head trauma .
