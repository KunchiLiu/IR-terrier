The study conduct two part . The first part assessment safety tolerability single dose ALTH12-1:4 comparator , mesalamine ( 4.0g 5-ASA ) follow assessment repeat administration study drug ( ALTH12-1:4 comparator ) 6 week . The second part assessment ALTH12-2:4 . Three subject enrol cohort : 2 receive ALTH12 enema therapy 1 subject receive comparator enema therapy . A total 9 patient enrol study , allow 3 replacement additional patient .</brief_summary>
