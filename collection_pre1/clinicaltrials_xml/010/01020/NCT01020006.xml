	<brief_title>Study Safety Tolerability PCI-27483 Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Patients Receiving Treatment With Gemcitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct three segment : Part A , Part B Part C. Parts A B 12 week treatment follow 4 week evaluation . In part A patient dose-escalate three dose level PCI-27483 administer subcutaneous ( SC ) injection twice-daily ( BID ) . Part B start 4th patient completes 90 112 dos 8 week . In part B patient randomize PCI-27483 gemcitabine ( active arm ) OR gemcitabine ( control arm ) . PCI-27483 dos Part A B administer combination standard regimen gemcitabine . Patients tumor response stable disease 12 week opportunity continue PCI-27483 treatment disease progression Investigator considers study treatment longer tolerable . Treatment gemcitabine either active control arm may continue standard course gemcitabine therapy complete . Patients complete Part A Part B 16 week study regardless treatment duration . Evaluable patient roll part C follow 12 month enrollment ( first dose ) .</detailed_description>
