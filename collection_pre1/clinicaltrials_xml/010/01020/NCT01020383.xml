	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize open-label Phase II study compare safety , tolerability biological effectiveness ALX-0081 versus GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor ReoPro® high risk PCI patient . Patients receive standard treatment acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) plus clopidogrel heparin . Eligible patient randomly assign receive open-label study treatment either ALX-0081 ReoPro® . Patients stratify accord PCI type ( elective ad-hoc ) stent type ( bare metal stent drug elute stent ) .</brief_summary>
