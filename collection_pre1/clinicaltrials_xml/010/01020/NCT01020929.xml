	<brief_summary>The investigator hop learn incidence needle placement epidural intravascular space , learn mixed epidural-intravascular pattern relate needle type , gauge , level injection . We also hope evaluate length fluoroscopy time use real time fluoroscopy contrast dye injection , evaluate radiation exposure hand physician protocol , confirm incidence fo intravascular injection sensitivity needle flash blood , In lumbar spine , vascular contrast pattern twice likely appear simultaneous anticipated epidural pattern , occur alone . This important since practitioner likely miss vascular pattern occur simultaneous epidural spread , occur alone . The incidence intravascular penetration cervical transforaminal epidural injection know exceed lumbar injection , however study determine incidence simultaneous epidural vascular injection cervical spine . This study may prove real time fluoroscopy contrast injection warrant prevent intravascular injection resultant side effect support standard care . Intermittent fluoroscopy yield false-negative result intravascular injection simultaneous epidural intravascular injection occur . This could lead increase risk complication intravascular injection medication reduce overall efficacy . No study date quantify incidence needle placement locate intravascular space epidural space simultaneously .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Any patient undergoing lumbar cervical transforaminal epidural , order treat physician provide write informed consent procedure conduct . The content consent form use explain study patient . There drug treatment associate study part exist treatment plan . There subject randomization . Subjects recruit consecutively . Patients pregnancy , coagulopathy , systemic infection , allergy contrast dye , mentally disabled unable give inform consent exclude study . 1 . One experienced physician ( &gt; 5 year experience ) use intermittent fluoroscopy place needle transforaminal epidural position use standard technique . The physician use real time fluoroscopy inject contrast solution determine pattern contrast flow ( standard care ) . 2 . For individual epidural site ( level side per patient per set count separate injection ) follow identify : 1 . Patients age 2 . Diagnosis ( reason epidural ) i.e . spinal stenosis , HNP , DDD 3 . Procedure level 4 . Gauge needle 5 . Type needle tip 6 . Aspiration blood needle hub pre-injection 7 . Contrast pattern use real time fluoroscopy 8 . Number attempt needle position 9 . Total fluoro time per case 3 . The physician routinely wear ring radiation badge determine average radiation exposure hand . 4 . Analyze result 5 . Confirm incidence intravascular pattern per level determine incidence mixed intravascular-epidural pattern per level . 6 . Quantify average fluoro exposure time compare average flouro time identical procedure use intermittent fluoroscopy . All procedure protocol standard care . All data collect procedure . There follow-ups procedure . We ask participant willing contact regard future research study may interest .</detailed_description>
