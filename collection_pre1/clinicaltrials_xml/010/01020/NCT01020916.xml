	<detailed_description>Detailed statistical analysis plan Target Temperature Management Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest trial 1 . Introduction The Target temperature management out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , randomise , parallel-group , assessor-blinded clinical trial ( TTM-trial ) large trial date post-cardiac arrest treatment temperature management intensive care set . To prevent outcome reporting bias data drive analysis result , International Conference Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice others recommend clinical trial analyse accord pre-specified plan [ 1 ] . Leading expert critical care community advocate recommendation rather prerequisite [ 2 ] . Here describe statistical analysis plan finalise data collection TTM-trial still go , data analysis main publication TTM-trial result adhere . The steer group TTM-trial unanimously approve statistical analysis plan December 3rd 2012 , patient recruitment 950 patient complete January 10th 2013 , final follow-up predict occur begin July 2013 , database lock analyse . 2 . Trial overview The TTM-trial multicentre , multinational , outcome assessor-blinded , parallel group , randomise clinical trial compare two strict target temperature regimens 33°C 36°C adult patient , sustain return spontaneous circulation unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , admit hospital . The study background , design , rationale previously publish [ 3 , 4 ] . The TTM-trial protocol ( current version 3.3 ) available online www.ttm-trial.org since start trial . The trial register clinicaltrials.gov NCT01020916 endorse European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network Scandinavian Critical Care Trials Group . 3 . Objective The primary aim TTM-trial compare effect two strict target temperature protocols first 36 hour hospital stay resuscitation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( 4 hour achieve target temperature , 24 hour maintenance target temperature , 8 hour rewarming ) . The null hypothesis difference survival end trial ( 180 day randomisation last patient ) target temperature 33°C compare 36°C . To demonstrate reject Hazard Ratio difference 20 % group , equivalent approximately one month difference median survival time assume proportional hazard group observation time , sample size 900 patient would necessary type-1 error risk 5 % type-2 error risk 10 % . To allow patient lost-to-follow target population set 950 patient . 4 . Stratification design variables The stratification variable use trial site ( hospital ) . Pre-defined design variable allow adjusted analysis primary outcome , pre-defined subgroup analysis : age , gender , first present cardiac rhythm ( shockable non-shockable ) , duration cardiac arrest , presence shock admission . 5 . Definition efficacy variables The outcome define primary , secondary exploratory ( tertiary trial protocol ) . Only primary secondary outcome analyse first publish report TTM-trial due complexity exploratory outcome , thus need separate publication . Primary outcome The primary outcome survival end trial , 180 day randomisation last patient . Secondary outcome include adverse event The main secondary outcome composite outcomes 1. poor neurological function define Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) 3 4 , death ( CPC 5 ) ; 2. poor neurological function define modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) 4 5 , death ( mRS 6 ) evaluate 180 day ( +/- 14 day ) randomisation . The number study participant category CPC mRS report separately . The following adverse event include secondary outcome : bleeding , pneumonia , electrolyte disorder , hyperglycemia , hypoglycaemia , cardiac arrhythmia , myoclonic tonic-clonic seizure , renal replacement therapy . Definitions adverse event describe earlier [ 4 ] . Other secondary outcome Cerebral Performance Category intensive care unit hospital discharge , best Cerebral Performance Category entire trial period . Exploratory outcomes Neurological function 180 day define CPC , mRS , Informant Questionnaire Cognitive Decline Elderly ( IQCODE ) , Mini mental state exam ( MMSE ) two simple question : 1a . In last two week , require help another person every day activity ? ( If yes : 1b . Is new situation follow heart arrest ? ) , 2 . Do feel make complete mental recovery heart arrest ? [ 4 ] . Quality life define Short-Form 36 . 6 . Data point Baseline variables - Sex - Age - Comorbidities* - Chronic heart failure ( NYHA 3 worse ) - Previous acute myocardial infarction - Ischaemic heart disease - Previous cardiac arrhythmia - Previous cardiac arrest - Arterial hypertension - Previous transient ischaemic attack stroke - Epilepsy - Diabetes mellitus - Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Chronic hemo- peritoneal dialysis - Hepatic cirrhosis - Haematological malignancy - Other malignancy - Acquired immune deficiency syndrome - Alcoholism - Intravenous drug abuse - Other immunodeficiency - Pre-morbid Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) - Previous percutaneous coronary intervention - Previous coronary bypass graft - Previous valvular surgery - Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator pacemaker - Age - Pre-hospital variable - Location cardiac arrest - Bystander witness arrest - Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) - First monitor rhythm arrival emergency medical service - Use active compression-decompression device - Time cardiac arrest start basic life support - Time arrest start advance life support - Time arrest return spontaneous circulation - Data admission - First measure temperature ( tympanic ) - Glasgow Coma Scale ( combine score ) - pH - Lactate - Shock admission - Acute ST-elevation infarction novel leave bundle branch block - A comorbidity report frequency equal 5 % intervention group . Pre-morbid CPC report regardless frequency . Intervention period variable Core temperature primarily measure urinary bladder report per hour 36 hour intervention period . Neurological prognostication withdrawal care Number proportion patient still comatose 72 hour end intervention period underwent neurological prognostication blind physician . Number patient , survive neurological prognostication presume cause death , include limitation care reason . Number patient electroencephalogram , somatosensory evoked potential , magnetic resonance imaging , compute tomography head . Concomitant cardiological treatment Number patient receive coronary angiography , percutaneous coronary intervention coronary bypass grafting , divide three time group ( immediately admission , intervention sedate intensive care unit , regain consciousness . Number patient receive intra aortic balloon pump , mechanical assist device , temporary pacemaker , permanent pacemaker implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . Other descriptive variable Number day intensive care unit day mechanical ventilation index ICU-admission day hospital within index admission report . 7 . General analysis principles 1 . Analyses conduct accord modify intention-to-treat principle [ 5 ] otherwise state . 2 . All test significance two-sided maximal type-1 error risk 5 % 3 . The primary analysis primary secondary outcome modify intention-to-treat population adjust protocol specify stratification variable [ 6 ] necessary use data set generate use multiple imputation ( see ) . An unadjusted analysis analysis adjust stratification predefined design variable carry sensitivity analysis . Other analysis may also do use e.g . slightly different population . If result analyse consistent primary analysis discuss . Nevertheless , conclusion study still base primary analysis . 4 . The test interaction intervention design variable use identify subgroup exploratory . 5 . Risks report hazard ratio risk ratio 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) limit state point 6 . 6 . If data missingness specify primary secondary outcome le 5 % perform complete case analysis without impute miss value . If missingness 5 % perform Little 's test . If test indicate complete case data set random sample continue without impute miss value analyse complete case . If Little 's test indicate data set complete case random sample total data set report point estimate 95 % confidence limit apply worst/best scenario imputation miss value . If worst/best case analyse allow conclusion perform multiple imputation . However , worst/best case imputation provide different conclusion , multiple imputation perform , create 10 imputed data set assumption missingness random . The result trial pool intervention effect 95 % CI analyse data set multiple imputation . Primarily observe P-values primary five secondary outcome present . However , multiplicity , possibly reason spurious statistically significant P-values , may problem result several outcome present . We therefore want present supplemental analysis result P-values adjust multiplicity accord fall-back procedure [ 7 ] . The P-values adjusted multiplicity present discussed relation unadjusted P-values . This adjustment may need control overall probability type 1 error ( rejection null hypothesis actually true ) keep family wise error rate 0.05 require regulatory agency . This do specify weight hypothesis assign accord importance . The sequence hypothesis test individual weight ( parenthesis ) : primary outcome ( 0.50 ) , first secondary outcome ( 0.25 ) , second secondary outcome ( 0.0625 ) , third secondary outcome ( 0.0625 ) , fourth secondary outcome ( 0.0625 ) , fifth secondary outcome ( 0.0625 ) . The multiplicity problem illuminate Discussion section . 8 . Statistical analysis Trial profile Flow study participant display CONSORT diagram show Box 1 [ 8 ] . Number screen patient fulfil study inclusion criterion number include primary secondary analysis well reason exclusion primary secondary analysis report . Primary outcome Frequencies percentages per group , well hazard ratios 95 % CI report . The primary outcome analyse use Cox-regression adjusting variable indicate . The proportional hazard assumption across treatment group check test interaction intervention time plot cumulative hazard function intervention group . 1 . The first analysis primary outcome , adjust stratification variable , patient meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion time randomisation . Patients meet inclusion criterion receive intervention ( temperature management ) erroneously randomise exclude accord modify intention treat principle . 2 . The second analysis primary outcome patient meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion major protocol violation ( per-protocol analysis ) . 3 . The third analysis primary outcome analysis adjust stratification variable design variable . 4 . The analysis repeat site group variable indicate whether patient allocate 2 site allocate patient one site ( would approximately ¼ trial population ) . Secondary outcome include adverse event Frequencies percentage per group , well risk ratio 95 % CI report . A standard Chi2-test use assess effect treatment binary categorical outcome . For adjusted primary analysis logistic regression analysis use . Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney 's test use continuous outcome . There report significance test composite outcome mortality poor neurological outcome versus survival good neurological outcome ; individual sub-scores CPC mRS. For adverse event Chi2-test one adverse event versus adverse event . If significant difference treatment group occurrence adverse event try delineate event drive difference .

Discussion With statistical analysis plan present different analysis main publication TTM-trial avoid risk outcome report bias data drive result . Of pre-specified outcome trial choose report primary secondary main publication , complexity detail neurological outcome quality life constitutes exploratory outcome , require separate publication . We would like emphasise main secondary outcome composite outcome poor neurological function mortality 180 day cardiac arrest great importance situation neutral outcome primary outcome , interpret result derive clinical implication TTM-trial . As survival outcome low risk bias , prone compete risk , early trial registry data indicate low sample size need show risk reduction composite outcome mortality poor neurological function use ( compare mortality/survival ) , fundament order outcome . The composite outcome poor neurological function mortality hopefully benefit increased power respect possibility find reject significant signal trial power survival , would require large sample size . Comments multiplicity problem There one primary 5 secondary outcome assess : - Primary outcome : survival - Secondary outcome 1 . Neurological ( CPC ) : binary quantity 2 . Neurological ( mRS ) : binary quantity 3 . Adverse event : binary quantity 4 . Cerebral performance category measure specify point time : binary quantity 5 . Best cerebral performance specify period : binary quantity Thus six significance test . These adjusted multiplicity control probability type-1-error ( rejection null hypothesis true ) . One way diminish risk would deal six outcome one group use data driven adjustment P-values . The powerful procedure base raw P-values probably Hommel [ 7 ] . An alternative ( fixed sequence procedure ) would specify sequence hypothesis test advance . ( Primary outcome , first secondary outcome , second secondary outcome , - - - , fifth secondary outcome . ) In latter case multiplicity adjustment need . Then test do 0.05 level significance specify order . However , soon test non-significant remain null hypothesis accept without test . For instance primary outcome first secondary outcome significant 0.05 level second secondary outcome ( neurological function measure mRS ) insignificant , null hypothesis correspond secondary outcome 3 , 4 5 accept without test . A third approach so-called fall back procedure fix hypothesis test sequence also use . However , test insignificant , procedure stop next hypothesis test reduced level significance . This procedure also allow one weight hypotheses accord importance likelihood reject . Hommel 's procedure sensitive P-values last three test fall back procedure . Since first second secondary outcome probably produce similar P-values appear logical place weight primary first secondary outcome . Based consideration analyse TTM-trial present unadjusted P-values well adjust multiplicity use fall back procedure . 11 .
