	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy non-invasive peristaltic pulse pneumatic device ( PCD ) treatment intermittent claudication patient document peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . The pneumatic device study FDA approve treatment venous disease . While anecdotal evidence exists support decrease claudication symptom , previously publish data study employ compression device treatment arterial disease . The investigator ' primary hypothesis patient randomize intervention arm trial experience increase mean walk ability compare group receive medical standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Claudication With Peristaltic Pulse Pneumatic Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) common disorder , affect 12 % adult old 50 year age . Approximately one third patient experience intermittent claudication , define pain thigh calf muscle walk resolve rest . Lower extremity pain often severe enough significantly limit ambulation , force many patient seek medical care . Current treatment include two FDA-approved medication , supervise walk program , arterial angioplasty and/or stent placement , open arterial bypass surgery . The problem noninvasive treatment oftentimes ineffective , invasive treatment effective expensive . A non-invasive low extremity treatment show success treat lymphedema venous insufficiency study protocol assess effect claudication symptom . Half participant prospective , single-center randomize controlled trial treat pneumatic compression device home treatment program , half receive standard medical therapy . If effective , potential benefit high , provide relief personal disability avoidance costly surgical intervention .</detailed_description>
