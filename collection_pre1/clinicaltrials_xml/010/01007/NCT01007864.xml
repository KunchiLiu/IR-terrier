	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial investigate effect non-ergot dopamine agonist piribedil vigilance cognitive performance patient Parkinson 's disease comparison oral non-ergot dopamine agonist . It test whether piribedil superior continue pramipexole ropinirole treatment regard improvement reduce vigilance cognitive performance patient Parkinson 's disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Piribedil ( Clarium® ) Vigilance Cognitive Function Patients With Parkinson 's Disease Compared Other Non-Ergot Dopamine Agonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment motor symptom associate PD non-ergot dopamine agonist proven effective , monotherapy combination levodopa . Non-motor symptom like cognitive sleep-related disorder disturb vigilance , however , common PD significantly worsen health quality life patient family member . Some non-motor symptom may also cause antiparkinsonian medication per se . The Committee Proprietary Medicinal Products ( CPMP ) initiate review dopamine agonists relation episode sudden onset sleep already 2000 result special warning somnolence sudden sleep attack non-ergot dopamine agonist ' summary product characteristic . Beneficial effect piribedil parameter vigilance cognition describe several study . But , seem , study perform far identify effect set comparative study different oral non-ergot dopamine agonists patient PD , utilize vigilance cognitive parameter primary main secondary objective . The neuropsychological test apply study validate routinely used test study investigate different aspect attention vigilance cognition .</detailed_description>
