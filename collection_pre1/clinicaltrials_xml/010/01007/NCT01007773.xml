	<brief_title>Safety Dexmedetomidine Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 52,000 death occur traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) every year . TBI major cause disability , death , economic cost society . When brain experience injury , direct damage brain tissue cause local bleeding bruising . This call primary injury . Additional damage , call secondary brain injury , occur result swell brain , lack oxygen brain , lower blood pressure , release inflammatory mediator . The type degree insult major determinant final neurologic outcome patient sustain TBI . Management TBI aim prevention treatment secondary insult . The swell brain follow injury cause increase pressure within cranium . Increased pressure reduce blood flow part brain , lead brain damage . An intracranial pressure ( ICP ) monitor measure pressure surround brain , may place follow traumatic brain injury help evaluate swelling . Agitation patient exposure painful stimulus may significantly increase ICP , therefore , use sedative agent important ICP management . A variety pharmacological agent suggest treat agitation TBI patient . Unfortunately , optimal sedative regimen identify use patient population . One prospect dexmedetomidine ( Precedex® ) , FDA-approved short-term ( ≤24 hour ) sedation intensive care unit . Currently , knowledge , dexmedetomidine study prospectively adults traumatic brain injury . The safety efficacy dexmedetomidine therefore unknown severe TBI . Propofol employ first-line sedative agent neurotrauma patient due favorable pharmacokinetic profile . However , patient require prolonged infusion high rate propofol . This show increase risk development severe propofol-related infusion syndrome , fatal . Dexmedetomidine adjunct exist conventional sedative therapy may help facilitate decrease amount agent use , propofol . Therefore , aim study assess safety feasibility dexmedetomidine adjunct conventional sedative therapy compare conventional sedative therapy alone patient severe TBI .</detailed_description>
