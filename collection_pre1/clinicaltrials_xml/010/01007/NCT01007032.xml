	<detailed_description>Patients single-center , open-label , dose-escalation , Phase 1 study initially receive intravenous ( I.V . ) IMC-A12 every 2 week every 3 week 6 week ( one cycle ) . After first cycle , patient experience best overall response complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) continue receive IMC-A12 cohort dose schedule evidence progressive disease ( PD ) , withdrawal criterion meet . A minimum three patient enrol cohort . The start dose Cohort 1 6 mg/kg , administer every 2 week . Dose escalation Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ( 10 mg/kg administer every 2 week ) occur least three patient Cohort 1 complete one cycle therapy ( ie , complete initial 6 week treatment period discontinue therapy due IMC-A12 -related adverse event [ AE ] ) . Enrollment Cohort 3 ( start dose : 15 mg/kg administer every 3 week ) proceed patient complete one cycle therapy ( define ) Cohort 2 . Similarly , patient enrol Cohort 4 least three patient complete one cycle therapy Cohort 3 ; patient Cohort 4 receive 20 mg/kg administer every 3 week . Toxicity data cohort review prior dose escalation . No intrapatient dose escalation permit . Patients cohort complete first 6 week treatment reason IMC-A12 -related toxicity replace . A dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define one follow event , consider investigator definitely , probably , possibly relate IMC-A12 : Grade 4 neutropenia last &gt; 7 day ; Grade 4 anemia ; Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia ; Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia associate fever ; Grade 3 4 nonhematologic toxicity , exclude electrolyte abnormality Grade 3 hyperglycemia ; Grade 4 hyperglycemia ; and/or Grade 4 uncontrollable hypertension . If three patient complete first 6-week cycle ( accord definition outline ) DLTs , dose escalation Cohort 2 may proceed . If one DLT observe initial three patient Cohort 1 ( cohort ) Cycle 1 , three additional patient enrol cohort . If additional DLTs observe , dose escalation may continue describe . If two patient Cohort 1 experience DLT , six patient enrol Cohort 1A ( receive 4 mg/kg every 2 week ) . If two patient experience DLT dose Cohort 3 , six patient enrol dose Cohort 3A ( 10 mg/kg every 3 week ) . If two patient experience DLT dose Cohorts 2 4 , six additional patient enrol previous cohort ( Cohort 1 Cohort 3 , respectively ) , previous cohort consider maximum tolerate dose dosing schedule . If two patient cohort experience DLT Week 7 beyond ( Cycle 1 ) , data review enrollment may suspend . The Sponsor Principal Investigator , reference review Independent Data Safety Evaluation Committee ( establish separate document ) , determine whether enrollment resume .</detailed_description>
