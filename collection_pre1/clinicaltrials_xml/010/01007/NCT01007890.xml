	<brief_title>Prediction Response Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Women With Operable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study develop biomarker predict pathological complete response woman treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer . Such biomarker would assist physician select effective chemotherapy individual patient . The anticipated biomarker take account clinical factor ( tumor stage , tumor size , age ) , phenotypic characteristic tumor ( determined pathological immunohistochemistry ex vivo ChemoResponse assay ) , genotypic characteristic tumor patient ( determined genomic profiling via gene expression analysis tumor RNA ) . It expect collective consideration factor predictive patient response therapy alone . Approximately 224 evaluable subject recruit approximately 30 US site . Women measurable operable invasive breast cancer diagnose core needle biopsy eligible study . Additional tumor specimen obtain prior start chemotherapy via core needle biopsy use ex vivo ChemoResponse Assay tumor genomic analysis ( gene expression ) , respectively . All subject receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy one two standard care regimens must consist follow agent : doxorubicin ( A ) , cyclophosphamide ( C ) , taxane ( T ) docetaxel , paclitaxel , Abraxane ( nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel [ nab-paclitaxel ] ) ; , docetaxel ( T ) cyclophosphamide ( C ) . These must administer per NCCN guideline treat physician . Upon completion chemotherapy treatment , woman undergo lumpectomy , modify radical mastectomy surgical procedure determine appropriate investigator time evaluate pathological response . At time lumpectomy , modify radical mastectomy , surgical procedure , additional tumor excess send Precision Therapeutics , Inc. ( Precision ) exploratory analysis pathologic complete response ( pCR ) , sufficient tumor cell send , patient agree excess tumor cell send Precision purpose . During patient 's course participation study , treat physician remain blind result ChemoResponse Assay genomic analysis . If determine pCR time lumpectomy , modify radical mastectomy surgical procedure , Precision make available subsequent report physician contain additional information chemotherapy drug ACT could benefit treatment decision patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Female subject satisfy follow condition consider enrollment study : 1 . The subject must consent research study must sign approve consent form conform institutional guideline prior study entry . 2 . The diagnosis breast cancer make FNA biopsy ( incisional excisional ) . The tumor specimen must demonstrate diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma . 3 . The primary breast cancer must operable measurable `` great equal '' 2.0 cm use physical exam and/or ultrasound , MRI , CT scan , mammogram . 4 . T1c , T2 , T3 , T4 patient clinically stag M0 ( noninflammatory ) eligible . 5 . Patients prior diagnosis treatment DCIS eligible . 6 . Patients multifocal breast cancer eligible . 7 . The tumor must confine either breast breast ipsilateral axilla . 8 . The subject must 18 year old . 9 . The interval initial cytologic histologic diagnosis breast cancer registration must 10 week . 10 . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 ( see Appendix A ) require . 11 . The subject must receive standard care chemotherapy regimens consist either doxorubicin ( A ) , cyclophosphamide ( C ) , taxane ( T ) docetaxel , paclitaxel , nabpaclitaxel administer sequence combination treat physician determines docetaxel ( T ) plus cyclophosphamide ( C ) . Exclusion Criteria Male subject eligible study incidence breast cancer male subject significantly low female subject . Those subject strongly HER2positive exclude require treatment biological agent ChemoResponse Assay yet validate . Subjects evidence distant metastatic disease exclude subject would good candidate neoadjuvant therapy . Women excisional incisional biopsy prior entry would sufficient tumor sample test measure physical exam study . Women nonmalignant comorbid condition disease would preclude treated doxorubicin ( A ) , cyclophosphamide ( C ) , taxane ( T ) , complete study also exclude . Women psychiatric addictive disorder exclude protect vulnerable subject may able adequately give informed consent . Women one follow condition ineligible study : 1 . Tumor determine strongly HER2positive immunohistochemistry ( 3+ ) fluorescent situ hybridization ( positive gene amplification ) 2 . Definitive clinical radiologic evidence distant metastatic disease . 3 . Excisional incisional biopsy primary breast tumor . 4 . Inflammatory breast cancer . 5 . Synchronous contralateral breast cancer . 6 . Multicentric breast cancer . 7 . Participation NSABP B40 study . 8 . Prior therapy invasive breast cancer , include irradiation , chemo , immuno , and/or hormonal therapy . . Note : exception hormonal therapy , may give anytime diagnosis study entry long hormonal therapy discontinue registration . After surgery , hormonal therapy may restart , discretion treat physician . 9 . Current therapy hormonal agent raloxifene , tamoxifen , selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , either osteoporosis breast cancer prevention , sex hormonal therapy birth control pill , ovarian hormonal replacement therapy , etc . These patient eligible IF medication discontinue prior registration . 10 . Surgical axillary staging procedure prior study entry . . Note : exception include FNA axillary node preneoadjuvant sentinel lymph node biopsy patient clinically negative axillary node . 11 . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude woman treat doxorubicin ( A ) , cyclophosphamide ( C ) , taxane ( T ) , complete study . 12 . Psychiatric addictive disorder would preclude obtain informed consent .</criteria>
