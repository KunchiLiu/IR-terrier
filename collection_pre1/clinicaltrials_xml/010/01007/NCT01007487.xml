	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Plastic wound retractor reduce passage bacteria abdomen surgical incision site abdominal surgery Currently , plastic wound retractor use abdominal surgery facilitate access abdominal cavity . This study aim establish whether also prevent bacteria cross abdominal cavity surgical incision site . Patients undergo abdominal surgery plastic wound retractor ( Alexis® ) use eligible inclusion study . Swabs take inside outside plastic wound retractor prior remove retractor abdomen . The bacterial flora swab take inside outside plastic wound protector compare see difference inside outside retractor . Bacteria classify 'enteric ' ( i.e . gastrointestinal tract ) 'skin ' bacteria , depend usual location . The study aim establish whether plastic wound retractor ( Alexis® ) reduce translocation enteric bacteria surgical incision site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plastic Wound Retractors Bacterial Translocation Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plastic wound retractor currently use abdominal surgery wound retraction . They allow access intra-abdominal organ incision abdominal surgery . Plastic wound retractor may also act barrier bacterial translocation abdominal cavity wound . The purpose study compare microbial flora inside outside plastic wound retractor establish whether plastic wound retractor affect bacterial translocation . METHODS This multi-centre prospective observational study conduct November 2007 January 2010 . Patients undergo elective emergency abdominal surgery Alexis® wound retractor use eligible inclusion study . Swabs take inside outside Alexis® wound protector immediately prior removal wound protector abdominal cavity . Swabs undergo gram stain culture . `` Inside '' wound swab define part wound protector contact intra-abdominal organ , `` outside '' part contact skin subcutaneous tissue . Results inside outside swab compare establish whether difference bacterial flora . The study aim establish whether plastic wound retractor ( Alexis® ) reduce translocation enteric bacteria surgical incision site .</detailed_description>
