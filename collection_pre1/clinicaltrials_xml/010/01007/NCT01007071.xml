	<detailed_description>Eligibility screening : Diagnosis GHD base standard testing , include blunt GH response stimulation glucagon provocation , define GH &lt; 3 microgram/l . Subjects adult-onset GH deficiency include age 18-65 year old , naive GH replacement therapy , good general health , stable thyroid , glucocorticoid ( replacement dos ) gonadal replacement therapy least 6 week prior study initiation . Patients history Major Depression exclude . Baseline : Qualifying subject admit CTRU follow : Weight , body mass index , waist/hip ratio , menstrual cycle history female subject vital sign . Initial clinical laboratory assessment include IGF-1 , complete blood count , liver function test , free T4 , serum pregnancy test woman . Subjects undergo 3 hour neuropsychological test attention , work memory , executive function verbal memory assess Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III Wechsler Memory Scale ( WMS III ) . Quality life mood quantify Quality Life Scale , Hamilton Rating Scale Depression Quality Life Assessment Growth Hormone Deficiency Adults ( Qol AGHDA ) . After lunch break , patient undergo 1 hour MRI scan . Resting image obtain , thereafter simple letter , word picture project subject scanner . The subject ask simple question relate stimulus . Randomization treatment : Following completion baseline measurement , study participant randomize double blind fashion receive either active treatment GH placebo period 16 week . GH dosage increase incrementally first 6 week . At 16 week , subject randomize placebo switch GH open label fashion dose schedule base titration . Subjects initially randomize GH continue receive GH endocrinologist without follow study . For efficacy measure , neuropsychological test fMRI perform baseline 16 week , , subject initially randomize placebo , repeat study perform 32 week . Safety monitor include assessment change thyroid adrenal status , well change liver function .</detailed_description>
