	<brief_summary>Shunt failure remain significant problem pediatric patient hydrocephalus . If reliable technique accurate placement ventricular catheter develop , shunt survival may improve . The purpose study assess efficacy safety ultrasound guide shunt insertion technique hand experienced surgeon . The primary outcome measure ventricular catheter location determine post-operative brain image . The study conduct Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network ( HCRN ) , network establish conduct multi-institutional clinical trial pediatric hydrocephalus . Pediatric neurosurgeon HCRN center enrol study perform either ultrasound guide shunt surgery conventional shunt surgery . Patients undergo conventional shunt surgery serve contemporary control group .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must clinical radiographic evidence hydrocephalus determine pediatric neurosurgeon require ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( atrial , pleural , gallbladder shunt system exclude ) Patients prior history shunt insertion hydrocephalus . A history external ventricular drain , subgaleal reservoircatheter , subgaleal shunt permissible Patients must less 18 year age time shunt insertion Active CSF abdominal infection Spread tumor subarachnoid space document enhance imaging ( CT MRI ) head spine CSF leak without hydrocephalus Pseudotumor cerebri DandyWalker malformation arachnoid cyst cause hydrocephalus Loculations within ventricular system Hydranencephaly , alobar holoprosencephaly congenital anomaly brain severely distort ventricular anatomy ventricular catheter location determine Other systemic disorder would preclude insertion/revision ventricular shunt Other difficulty would preclude followup one year ( e.g . terminal illness life expectancy le 1 year )</criteria>
