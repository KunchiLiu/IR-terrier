	<brief_title>Markers Response Intravesical Bladder Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , researcher look marker could use identify - early time point - patient might respond treatment . This would allow researcher provide future patient information chance respond treatment . And , information , researcher could better counsel patient might benefit different therapy earlier time point . Treatment BCG BCG plus interferon currently effective nonsurgical treatment superficial bladder cancer . However , time , reliable test help researcher predict patient respond therapy . You receive BCG BCG plus interferon therapy plan physician . This standard therapy decide doctor base disease characteristic . If agree take part study , participation affect treatment receive way . Your follow-up disease monitoring do accord standard routine . By participate study , agree provide researcher 4 tablespoon ( much produce ) urine follow time point . 1 . Before start therapy . 2 . Just 4 hour last treatment ( usually occur 6 week start treatment ) . 3 . Just 4 hour last treatment second course therapy ( usually 3 month begin first course therapy . In addition , provide researcher bladder wash sample . This sample collect routine catheterization ( plan treatment ) routine cystoscopic exam . Bladder wash sample collect follow time point . 1 . Before start therapy . 2 . Just last treatment ( usually occur 6 week start treatment ) . 3 . At first routine cystoscopic follow-up ( usually occur 3 month ) . 4 . At second routine cystoscopic follow-up ( usually occur 6 month ) . Your follow-up cystoscopies maintenance therapy do accord routine care decide doctor affect participation study . You part study 24 month begin treatment . At end period , 23 27 month , check cystoscopy cytology see tumor come back , part standard care . In addition , information collect medical chart medication take condition , diabetes heart disease , may . Information also collect previous treatment bladder cancer well treatment may receive study . This may include treatment receive outside health facility . Neither name medical record number keep information . All information collect study keep locked cabinet researcher access . Upon completion study , information sheet destroy . This investigational study . A total 300 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Disease Characteristics : Histologically confirm primary recurrent nonmuscleinvasive transitional cell carcinoma intact bladder Stage Ta , T1 , carcinoma situ Grade 1 , 2 , 3 Primary disease site must urinary bladder No evidence tumor invasion muscularis propria cystoscopy biopsy within past 6 week Upper tract image within prior 12 month Patient Characteristics : Age : 18 year Gender : Male female Life expectancy : 24 month great Performance status : 0 1 Prior Therapy : Biologic therapy : allow Chemotherapy : allow Radiotherapy : prior pelvic radiotherapy Surgery : recover prior transurethral resection Intravesical Immunotherapy : In opinion treat physician , patient must candidate `` standard care '' intravesical immunotherapy , define Induction 6 weekly treatment intravesical BCG follow maintenance 3 weekly treatment intravesical BCG 3 month . Continued maintenance therapy 6 month every 6 month total 36 month ( `` Lamm regimen '' ) ( 38 ) optional leave discretion physician Induction 6 weekly treatment intravesical BCG plus IFNalfa2b follow maintenance 3 weekly treatment BCG plus IFNalfa2b 3 month . Continued maintenance therapy 9 month , 15 month ( `` O'Donnell regimen '' ) ( 39 ) optional leave discretion physician . Patients include study base 'intent treat ' . If , start induction , treat physician decides alter treatment regimen , patient still include analysis . Special Situations : A special situation arises course study , patient develops recurrent tumor , deem treating physician require either reinduction course BCG therapy therapy BCG plus Interferon . In case , patient remain protocol , since urine cytology/FISH cytokine responses dependent treatment timetable , start collect urine sample , already describe previously protocol . Also , start change treatment plan , patient 's overall time protocol prolong completion 24month period time . Exclusion Criteria Ongoing Pregnancy Patients eligible receive standardofcare intravesical immunotherapy histologically confirm pure squamous cell carcinoma pure adenocarcinoma , patient nonurothelial bladder cancer sarcoma , immunocompromised patient</criteria>
