	<brief_title>A Novel Echocardiography Modality Assess Left Ventricular Dyssynchrony</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac resynchronization therapy emerge highly effective treatment option select patient symptomatic congestive heart failure optimal medical therapy evidence leave ventricular ( LV ) conduction delay contraction dyssynchrony . It improve quality life result well survival select group patient . However , patient different response CRT , 30 % implant show response . Ongoing trial , whether prospective retrospective , try define best predictor response CRT measure ventricular dyssynchrony . Despite , single echo criterion date predict successful CRT current guideline . In study , propose compare LV muscle mechanical dyssynchrony assessment speckle track hemodynamic dyssynchrony assessment 4D segmental ejection fraction ( EF ) , novel modality bring recently University Missouri Echocardiography laboratory .</detailed_description>
