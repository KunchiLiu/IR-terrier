	<brief_summary>The purpose research study effect weight loss gastric bypass surgery heart blood pressure body use metabolizes sugar , fat proteins eat . Additionally , researcher want study fat tissue gene pattern may responsible carry fat body , well look carefully possible link adipose tissue insulin resistance . The researcher also want evaluate liver presence fatty liver , common people obesity associate insulin resistance , well study liver gene pattern may associate non-alcoholic liver disease . Evaluating cardiovascular function endocrine function gastric bypass surgery , well study adipose liver tissue may help u understand link obesity , insulin resistance , fatty liver disease , high blood pressure health problem diabetes heart disease . Consequently , may help future identify benefit gastric bypass surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity associate insulin resistance diabetes . Since condition implicate cardiovascular complication , association may explain obesity related illness death . Gastric bypass consider `` gold standard '' surgical weightloss procedure demonstrate cure diabetes insulin resistance . Some severely obese patient , however , normal insulin-glucose metabolism . The difference metabolic healthy severely obese individual fully recognize understood . This research study insulin-glucose metabolism population severely obese individual undergo gastric bypass . This investigation base follow hypothesis : 1 . Severely obese individual categorize degree insulin-glucose homeostasis impair . 2 . The degree insulin resistance correlate risk cardiovascular disease . Weight loss obese individual insulin resistance , correlate improvement parameter associate cardiovascular disease . Obese individual well insulin sensitivity high risk cardiovascular disease therefore experience risk reduction cardiovascular disease . 3 . Insulin resistance consequence pathological storage excess energy intake ; therefore , individual insulin resistant obese differ individual obese , insulin resistant regard gene expression subcutaneous adipose tissue visceral adipose tissue . Subjects study evidence end organ dysfunction predictor morbidity mortality preoperatively postoperatively . Additionally , gene expression subcutaneous visceral adipose depot subject study</detailed_description>
