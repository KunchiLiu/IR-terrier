	<brief_summary>People hayfever allergic rhinitis often complain eye symptom associate nasal symptom . How people hayfever develop eye symptom clear . The purpose study well understand generation eye symptom patient allergic rhinitis . We previously show place substance subject allergic nose cause nose eye symptom . This explain parasympathetic neurogenic reflex nose eye . Such reflex would readily explain tear watery eye symptom , explain itch . In study , go address one possible explanation itch ; axonal neurogenic reflex stimulate mast cell eye release histamine , cause itch ? We place antihistamine drop eye challenge nose allergen . We also attempt demonstrate mast activation n't effect block initiate reflex nasal steroid , do previous study , show addition antihistamine add reduction symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We perform randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , four-way crossover study 21 subject seasonal allergic rhinitis study season . Healthy patient , 18 50 year age , come Nasal Physiology Laboratory The University Chicago screening , complete allergy questionnaire underwent skin puncture test confirmation allergy grass ragweed . Female subject give pregnancy test . Patients eligible underwent screen nasal challenge either grass ragweed allergen depend skin test result history . The study approve Institutional Review Board The University Chicago patient give write informed consent entry . After 2-week washout period , screen challenge , 21 subject positive screening challenge return Nasal Physiology Laboratory randomize receive 1 week one four treatment : - placebo ( PL ) nasal spray PL eye drop ( PL/PL ) , - PL nasal spray olopatadine ( OLO ) 0.2 % ophthalmic solution ( PL/OLO ) , - fluticasone furoate ( FF , also know Veramyst ) nasal spray PL eye drop ( FF/PL ) , - FF nasal spray olopatadine ( OLO ) 0.2 % ophthalmic solution ( FF/OLO ) . Specifically , PL eye drop use lubricant eye drop active ingredient 0.3 % glycerin 1.0 % propylene glycol PL nasal spray provide GlaxoSmithKline . Treatment OLO consist 1 drop 0.2 % OLO eye daily treatment FF consist 2 puff nostril daily , give total 110 microgram deliver nostril . After week treatment , subject return Nasal Physiology Laboratory undergo nasal challenge . The subject return next day still receive treatment another nasal challenge augment nasal ocular reflex . Next , patient 2-week washout period switch next randomized treatment arm . This sequence repeat subject complete four arm trial .</detailed_description>
