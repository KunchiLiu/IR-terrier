	<brief_summary>Myocardial Infarctions ( MI ) commonly know heart attack . An ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) severe type heart attack . Myocardial Infarctions happen coronary artery partially fully block suddenly blood clot , cause damage least heart muscle supply artery . In STEMI , blood clot completely block coronary artery . This result damage heart muscle supply affected artery . The purpose IK-1001 STEMI Study evaluate safety effectiveness investigational study drug ( IK-1001 ) . IK-1001 studied determine safe reduce amount damage cause heart STEMI . Potential subject may eligible diagnosed STEMI undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI , procedure block coronary artery unblocked cardiac catheterization ) , well meet entry criterion . Up 446 men woman , age 18-80 , participate study 50 medical site around world . Study participation last six month . Subjects receive study drug intravenous catheter three hour PCI procedure . Subjects monitor hospital approximately three four day PCI . There three follow-up visit one , three six month PCI study investigator discharge hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IK-1001 ( Sodium Sulfide ( Na2S ) Injection ) Subjects With Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , randomize , dose-escalation , dose-expansion , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center study evaluate safety , PK , POC efficacy subject acute STEMI undergoing PCI . The study conduct two part . Part 1 dose escalation portion study . A minimum 24 evaluable subject enrol Part 1 receive either IK-1001 ( n = 18 ) placebo ( n = 6 ) . Each subject receive continuous infusion study drug one three dose escalate level 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 mg/kg/hr infusion 3 hour . At dose level , 8 subject enrol ( 6 receive IK-1001 2 receive placebo ) . Placebo consist commercially available normal saline ( NS ) [ 0.9 % sodium chloride ( NaCl ) ] . Treatment study drug ( either IK-1001 placebo ) initiate informed consent obtain STEMI diagnosis make base clinical ECG finding . ECG criterion STEMI diagnosis include : - Subjects present ≥ 30 minute ischemic chest pain within 12 hour symptom onset - Subjects persistent ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm least 2 contiguous lead ECG All subject receive study drug successful PCI ( define subject Grade 3 reperfusion achieve ) follow safety efficacy 6 month post-PCI study drug infusion . Study sample collect subject first 4 day follow PCI determination PK parameter sulfide blood thiosulfate plasma . In Part 1 , subject undergo PCI reason study drug discontinue , exclude efficacy assessment follow safety 7 day , replace new subject . Part 2 study expansion high safe continuous infusion dose evaluate Part 1 . Part 2 aim evaluate safety establish POC efficacy dose level . Initially , 190 eligible subject randomize receive either IK-1001 placebo 1:1 ratio . Two interim analysis ( IAs ) do 64 128 subject complete MI size evaluation Day 4 ( range 3 5 day ) , respectively . If safety concern dose level , enrollment Part 2 restart next low safe dose level determine Part 1 . If adequate efficacy signal dose level , enrollment Part 2 may restart either increase dose level ( e.g. , 1.75 mg/kg/hr 3 hour ) long duration infusion ( 1.5 mg/kg/hr 6 hour ) . A decision stop trial safety , efficacy , futility assess IA . No 446 subject enrol Part 2 study .</detailed_description>
