	<detailed_description>The mission Italian ClinicalService Project improve outcome comprehension diagnostic therapeutic strategy apply patient wear Medtronic implantable device . ClinicalService provide service evaluate improve quality clinical care Italian clinical practice . ClinicalService collect acute chronic patient device data large population routine usage device , without specific study intervention , always within approve intend use device . ClinicalService use core database expand specific data set particular patient population , disease , therapy , device feature . ClinicalService , prospective data collection data management infrastructure , form data-bank physician collect patient data receive report clinical device diagnostics data . Usage understanding diagnostics data may help physician optimize tailor device program patient therapy . This data-bank , queried retrospective statistical analysis , may help physician research , education scientific activity . Some example scientific focus available Italian ClinicalService Project include : - Describing use implantable device , cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) , pacemaker , implantable loop recorder others Italian clinical practice - Identifying predictor clinical variable correlate clinical outcome therapy response - Evaluating test method optimize device program patient therapy via device diagnostics patient report</detailed_description>
