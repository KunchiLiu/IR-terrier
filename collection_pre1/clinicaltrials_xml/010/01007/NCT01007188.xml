	<detailed_description>The objective study measure energy value almonds human diet study molecular mechanism may help explain beneficial health effect almonds . Epidemiologic study demonstrate inverse relationship nut consumption body weight , despite fact nut energy dense food . Intervention study show consumption nut effect body weight effect significantly less predicted . Fecal analysis study peanut , almond , pecan find increased fecal fat energy loss nut consumption ; however study almonds lack . Previous study suggest nut consumption imparts variety health benefit , include reduction cardiovascular disease improve satiety . However , study almonds extremely limited . The aim study determine energy value almonds human diet probe mechanism almonds impart health benefit . The metabolizable energy value almond nut calculate base chemical composition energy content consume diet excreta . This provide good estimate energy value almonds simply calculate energy value base Atwater factor . In addition determine energy value almonds , evaluate effect almond-rich diet plasma phytonutrient level gene expression change determine protective mechanism activate almond consumption .</detailed_description>
