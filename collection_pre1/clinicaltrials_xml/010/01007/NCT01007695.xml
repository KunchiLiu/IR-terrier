	<brief_summary>The investigator ' hypothesis valproic acid give surgery newly diagnose breast cancer increase breast tumor histone acetylation tolerable dos increase breast tumor histone acetylation correlate valproic acid blood level change peripheral blood white blood cell histone acetylation . Published vitro study show sensitivity breast cancer cell histone deacetylase inhibitor ( Fortunati et al. , 2008 ; Fuino et al. , 2003 ; Hodges-Gallagher et al. , 2007 ; Olsen et al. , 2004 ) . The investigator ' gene array data predict sensitivity valproic acid half breast cancer [ Bild , unpublished ] . The investigator hypothesize woman newly diagnose breast cancer valproic acid unacceptable toxicity rate le 15 % dos increase tumor histone acetylation valproic acid decrease Ki-67 least half breast tumor 20 % . The investigator also hypothesize genomically-derived signature sensitivity valproic acid ( GDSS-VPA ) use predict tumor decrease proliferation measure Ki-67 least 20 % . The investigator hypothesize valproic acid level histone acetylation level peripheral leukocyte correlate decrease Ki-67 proliferation index 20 % . The investigator hypothesize DCE-MRI imaging study provide accurate quantitative mean assess tumor response valproic acid . Finally , investigator hypothesize response valproic acid affect intrinsic breast cancer subtype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before treatment woman need DCE-MRI biopsy breast mass . For woman diagnosis breast cancer outside institution , study procedure illustrate figure 1 . Following screen labs enrollment , DCE-MRI perform follow biopsy obtain two core study immunohistochemistry study one core GDSS-VPA . The biopsy examine pathologist confirm diagnosis stain marker histone acetylation , proliferation , apoptosis . For woman come HCI breast biopsy suspicious mass great 1.5 cm exam , mammogram , ultrasound , CT , MRI , study procedure illustrate figure 2 . A DCE-MRI do day prior biopsy exist research MRI consent , possible . Biopsy material already obtain research purpose use tissue collection consent . One core place liquid nitrogen storage . If breast cancer see core , frozen core use clinical pathologist woman eligible study . If diagnosis cancer confirm , woman consent trial . If consent , frozen core may one section take confirm presence tumor , rest send GDSS-VPA . Once clinical examination non-frozen part core biopsy complete , study immunohistochemistry do remain tissue paraffin block . If DCE-MRI do prior biopsy , do soon possible biopsy . Once biopsy DCE-MRI obtain , woman receive therapy accord follow schedule . Valproic acid 30mg/kg/day divide BID start AM day 1 . We assess toxicity 2.5 day . If grade 2 side effect present , continue dose , reassess every three day . When side effect grade 1 less , increase dose 10 mg/kg/day every three day maximum 50mg/kg/day . If grade 3 side effect encounter , hold medicine side effect resolve restart previous dose level remainder time . The high tolerated dose continue day surgery , 7 day valproic acid therapy 12 day valproic acid therapy . If dose-limiting toxicity encounter , patient remove study . See appendix 18.2 schedule base day week treatment start . On day 3 6 , valproic acid level PWBC histone acetylation drawn prior dose increase . These lab use secondary endpoint optional woman transportation obtain blood may difficult . The proportion patient experience dose limit toxicity expect low . Dose limit toxicity would grade 4 confusion , grade 3 encephalopathy , grade 3 cognitive dysfunction , grade 3 somnolence , grade 3 dizziness , grade 3 tremor improve beta-blocker therapy , grade 4 non-hematologic adverse event . A 2 % rate dose limit toxicity would consider acceptable , 15 % rate dose limit toxicity would consider unacceptable . The stopping rule allow maximum one ( 1 ) patient experience dose limit toxicity per eight ( 8 ) patient accrue . Patient accrual stop excessive toxicity level toxicity exceed . More detail provide section 11.1 . With stop rule , probability stop trial excessive toxicity 0.16 true rate DLT 2 % , probability stop trial excessive toxicity 0.88 true rate DLT 15 % . Between day 7 day 12 , subject high tolerate dose valproic acid treatment least two day , DCE-MRI perform followed surgical excision primary tumor per standard care . If surgery delay neoadjuvant therapy non-study related reason , repeat biopsy perform . The last dose valproic acid take morning surgery biopsy . Following surgery biopsy , one end study visit subject ass linger toxicity . Data subject take clinical appointment 6 month surgery assess relapse rate .</detailed_description>
