	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect 12 week progressive resistance training haemodialysis muscle quantity physical functioning chronic kidney disease patient receive maintenance haemodialysis . It hypothesise , base previous literature involve similar resistance training protocols catabolic condition , resistance training result significant increase muscle quantity well physical function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intradialytic Progressive Resistance Training Maintenance Haemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle waste common patient chronic kidney disease associate decreased ability complete activity daily live , increased hospitalisation therefore decrease quality life . In catabolic condition , cancer rheumatoid arthritis , exercise establish treatment reverse muscle waste . It uncertain whether exercise effect chronic kidney disease population due alter hormone system may prevent anabolic effect exercise occur . However , progressive resistance training , exercise effective elicit anabolic response effectively carry haemodialysis patient . Therefore , study aim investigate whether twelve week intradialytic progressive resistance training programme effect muscle quantity , physical function quality life patient receive maintenance haemodialysis .</detailed_description>
