	<brief_summary>This purpose study assess safety ustekinumab psoriasis patient receive ustekinumab follow inadequate response methotrexate therapy . The study provide information doctor manage transfer methotrexate biologic agent ustekinumab . The study design compare two method transfer patient methotrexate ustekinumab . The two method compare discontinuation methotrexate immediate initiation ustekinumab versus initiation ustekinumab overlap gradual dose reduction methotrexate 4 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Ustekinumab Patients With Plaque Psoriasis Who Have Had Inadequate Response Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only limited data exist guide physician transition patient onto biologic agent conventional systemic agent find inadequate . Most Phase III regulatory study biologics , include ustekinumab , require washout period one three month previous therapy start study agent . Although advantageous methodological perspective , approach appear mirror real-world clinical practice , clinicians patient unwilling go without treatment extend period . As result , physician appear employ several arbitrary strategy transition patient . Two commonly used approach : Initiation biologic therapy immediate cessation previous conventional systemic therapy Initiation biologic therapy overlap gradual reduction previous conventional systemic therapy . Some physician opt first strategy minimise risk drug-drug interaction . Others opt second strategy minimise risk symptomatic worsen cessation previous treatment onset action biologic agent . This study aim compare safety , efficacy quality life outcomes associate two strategy , follow-up 52 week . The primary objective exploratory trial evaluate comparative safety week 12 two treatment transition strategy patient inadequate response methotrexate : discontinuation methotrexate immediate initiation ustekinumab versus initiation ustekinumab overlap gradual dose reduction methotrexate 4 week . Secondary objective study include evaluate safety , efficacy , quality life Week 52 . The focus trial estimation rather hypothesis testing , therefore , formal hypothesis test plan . The primary endpoint proportion patient experience one treatment-emergent adverse event ( AEs ) Week 12 within treatment transition arm . All proportion accompany estimate 95 % confidence interval . This phase IIIB/IV multicentre , open label , two-arm , randomise study , last 56 week ( include screen period ) . The primary endpoint assess 12 week treatment ( Week 12 ) . All treat patient follow safety efficacy Week 52 . Patients stratify accord body weight ensure similar distribution patient &gt; 100 kg two treatment arm . Approximately 4 week prior study start , patient provide consent participation screen accord requirement inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enter study . During Screening Phase , patient continue current treatment schedule dose methotrexate , folic acid prescribe . At Week 0 , prior first dose ustekinumab , patient randomise 1:1 one two treatment arm describe . Patients stratify accord baseline body weight ( = &lt; 100 kg &gt; 100 kg ) ensure similar distribution patient &gt; 100 kg two treatment arm . Patients eligible study men woman age 18 year old moderate severe plaque psoriasis Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) &gt; =10 , fail intolerant methotrexate therapy . Patients enter study must receive methotrexate dose 10-25 mg/week , receive methotrexate least 8 week prior screen . Approximately 576 patient include study approximately 100 site 20 country . In treatment arm , Patients weigh â‰¤ 100 kg receive ustekinumab 45 mg Weeks 0 , 4 16 . Patients achieve PASI 75 response Week 28 40 continue receive ustekinumab 45 mg Week 28 40 . Patients fail achieve PASI 75 response Week 28 receive ustekinumab 90 mg Week 28 40 . Patients achieve PASI 75 response Week 28 , fail achieve PASI 75 response Week 40 receive ustekinumab 90 mg Week 40 . Patients &gt; 100 kg receive ustekinumab 90 mg Weeks 0 , 4 , 16 , 28 40 , regardless achievement PASI 75 response . Consideration give discontinue treatment patient show response Week 28 . At Week 0 , eligible patient randomise one follow treatment regimen . The methotrexate dose reduction regime depend dose methotrexate screening . All patient stop methotrexate regardless final dose 4 overlapping week ( Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 3 ) . The last dose methotrexate give within 7 day period second dose ustekinumab . Safety evaluation include physical examination , body weight waist circumference , pregnancy testing , vital sign , clinical laboratory test full blood analysis biochemistry , skin assessment suspicious malignant lesion , Tuberculosis ( TB ) assessment , adverse event review collection . Efficacy evaluation , include Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) , Nail Psoriasis Severity Index ( NAPSI ) Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) , carry . Evaluations ass change quality life , include Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) , Hospital Anxiety Depression Score ( HADS ) , EuroQol-5 dimensional questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) Patient Benefit Index ( PBI ) , carry .</detailed_description>
