	<brief_summary>Carbon monoxide poison common . Many adult CO poison long-term , even permanent brain injury follow poisoning . However , little known long-term outcome child carbon monoxide ( CO ) poisoning . In study plan perform cognitive ( think ) vestibular ( balance ) test child ( age 6 16 ) 6 week 6 month follow CO poison . At 6-week visit , child parent agree , ask child provide DNA sample one three method : mouthwash , spit collection , swab inside child 's cheek . Each child 's DNA analyze gene know affect outcome follow brain injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each child 's participation study expect last 6 month . Testing schedule around 6 week carbon monoxide ( CO ) poison episode . During test , child ask complete test measure cognitive ( think ) , emotional , behavioral performance . We collect information child 's medical record CO poisoning episode , parent complete questionnaire problem may observe child since poisoning . The cognitive test take 3.5 hour 6-week interval , 2.5 hour 6-month interval . Around time , child also schedule vestibular ( balance ) test Intermountain Hearing Balance Center . Vestibular test occur twice , 6-weeks 6-months follow poisoning . At 6-week visit , child parent agree , ask child provide DNA sample one three method : mouthwash , spit collection , swab inside child 's cheek . Each child 's DNA analyze gene know affect outcome follow brain injury apolipoprotein E , sample also store indefinite period time . If discovery make gene affect outcome follow brain injury , child 's DNA analyze gene well . The primary outcome measure percentage patient cognitive sequela ( think complication result ) 6 week 6 month follow CO poison . Secondarily , also determine : 1 . Which individual neurocognitive ( think ) outcomes 6 week 6 month differ normative data . 2 . Whether difference neurocognitive ( think ) outcomes measurement 6 week 6 month . 3 . If difference vestibular ( balance ) health patient measurement 6 week 6 month .</detailed_description>
