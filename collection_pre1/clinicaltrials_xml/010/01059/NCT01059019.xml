	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate omega-3 supplement use adjunct therapy PRK patient . The investigator believe omega-3 supplement reduce size persistent epithelial defect ( PEDS ) eventually hasten corneal reepithelialization PRK surgery . If outcome study prof effective , PRK would attractive option seek refractive treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epithelial Healing Visual Outcomes Using Omega-3 Therapy Before After Photorefractive Keratectomy ( PRK ) Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye persistent epithelial defect ( PEDS ) follow LASIK PRK one common condition encounter refractive surgeon patient 's today.¹⁻⁴ They associate significant clinical morbidity patient result minor problem discomfort , extreme debilitation visual loss . There accepted definition persistent epithelial defect ( PED ) include time period recovery . We favor definition give one text `` … epithelium fail re-grow defect within expect time course.⁵ The cause PED diverse , several definite etiology ' include dry eye , limbal stem cell deficiency , diabetes mellitus neurotrophic problem . A variety treatment modality describe PED . The elimination predisposing associate risk remain key factor management process . Therefore , prevent manage common disorder important understanding pathophysiology dry eye LASIK PRK . This include understanding relationship interaction inflammation , sensory denervation essential fatty acid pathway . Reports clinical efficacy anti-inflammatory therapy treatment dry eye disease provide direct proof principle inflammation involve etiology dry eye disease . Research show omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid effective natural anti inflammatory agent available . The active ingredient omega 3 , EPA ( Eicosapentanoic acid ) 20 carbon omega 3-fatty acid 5 double-bonds , DHA ( docosahexanoic acid ) 22 carbon omega-3 fatty acid 6 double bond , find certain fish oil enhance conversion COX ( cyclooxygenase ) prostaglandin E3 . A natural anti inflammatory agent , prostaglandin E3 competitively inhibit effect arachidonic acid conversion prostaglandin E2 , highly inflammatory substance . Prostaglandin E3 also inhibit synthesis TNFα IL-1β , inflammatory leukotrienes , also competitive inhibition.⁶ʹ⁷ By decrease inflammation stimulate aqueous tear production rabbit cAMP show stimulate aqueous tear secretion dry eye . Furthermore , decrease inflammation augment oil water layer tear film , omega-3 supplementation fish oil rich EPA may improve lipid aqueous component tear film . This may improve surgical outcome stabilize tear film , reduce epithelial defect promote wound healing</detailed_description>
