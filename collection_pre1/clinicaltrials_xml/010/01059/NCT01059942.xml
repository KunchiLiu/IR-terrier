	<brief_summary>The aim project develop validate simple , flexible , reliable , real-time observation tool evaluate hand-off practice . The Hand-off CEX paper-based instrument use evaluate either sender receiver hand-off communication . This tool base previously-validated , widely-used , real-time educational evaluation tool ( Mini-CEX ) ; publish expert opinion ; prior research . The investigator ' tool incorporates unique role-based anchor sender receiver refer verbal communication , professionalism environment , hand-off domain inform preliminary work expert opinion . The Hand-off CEX ( Clinical Evaluation Exercise ) use academic hospitalists house-staff physician assess feasibility . We , investigator , also assess construct validity inter-rater reliability tool use standardize , videotape hand-off scenario depict various level performance hand-off scenario . We hypothesize Hand-off CEX arm educator innovative , necessary , valid feasible method training health professional conduct safe effective hand-offs . Finally , Hand-off CEX useful tool assist hospital improve patient safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Validation Tool Measure Hand-off Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transitions patient care among inpatient provider occur frequently require provider transmit critical clinical information . If information omit misunderstood hand-off , serious clinical consequence may result patient care . In fact , study show hand-offs often variable represent major gap safe patient care . For patient cared resident physician , danger pose poor communication may amplify since implementation resident duty hour restriction July 2003 increase transfer frequency.In addition , trainee receive formal training hand-offs . The Joint Commission currently require hospital implement standardize , interactive approach hand-off communication . Unfortunately , due lack valid , standardized tool evaluate hand-off quality , hospital educator assess whether hand-offs meet criterion . More recently , Institute Medicine recommend resident receive formal education hand-off strategy . Education best practice hand-offs assessment hand-off quality need several reason : improve clinical practice evaluation feedback , illuminate area deficiency current practice maximize patient safety era duty hour restriction . At University Chicago Yale , investigator extensive experience describe hand-off quality , design implement novel curriculum improve hand-off education amongst vary level trainee elucidate relationship patient care outcomes poor hand-off quality . Therefore , draw preliminary work area , relevant practice industry , aim develop test generalizable tool evaluate hand-offs clinical setting .</detailed_description>
