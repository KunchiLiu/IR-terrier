	<brief_summary>The aim study analyze result PresbyLASIK perform use wavefront-optimized LASIK treatment presbyopia low hyperopic low myopic patient astigmatism . Visual performance assess use clinical outcome measure follow : refraction , near , intermediate distance visual acuity , stereoacuity contrast sensitivity . Questionnaires also use evaluate patient 's vision surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral PresbyLASIK Using Allegretto Wavelight System For The Treatment Presbyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presbyopia physiologic change relate age reduction eye 's ability focus order obtain clear vision near distance . At approximately age 40 range accommodation begin decrease diminish capacity eye focus near point focus . This make need corrective lens necessity order read near well focus intermediate distance . Presbyopia correction one frequently discuss topic refractive surgery today . The idea create multifocal cornea use refractive surgery spark tremendous interest find solution grow population throughout world , especially amongst surgeon ophthalmic industry PresbyLASIK essentially involve creation multifocal surface able correct visual defect distance simultaneously allow freedom near spectacle dependency presbyopic patient . PresbyLASIK currently offer routinely patient San Diego area , across country well numerous center around world . Conclusions study would serve guide keratorefractive surgeon , pursue peripheral PresbyLASIK , determine preoperative patient feature order achieve best outcome use Wavelight-Allegretto System .</detailed_description>

The low age limit 35 early age reduction accommodation occur . Refractive error +3.00 5.00 diopter ( D ) sphere spectacle plane 3.00D refractive astigmatism ( negative cylinder format ) Best spectacle correct visual acuity least 20/20 J3 eye . Residual corneal bed thickness â‰¥ 330 micron Demonstrated refractive stability , confirm clinical record . Neither spherical cylindrical portion refraction may change 0.50D 12month period immediately precede baseline examination . Soft contact lens user must remove lens least one week baseline measurement . Hard contact lens user ( PMMA rigid gas permeable lens ) must remove lens least 4 week prior baseline measurement two central keratometry reading two manifest refraction take least one week apart differ 0.50 diopter either meridian ; mire regular . Located great San Diego area 6month period . Exhibit strong motivation attend followup visit . Access transportation meet followup requirement . Patients previously treat refractive surgery ( LASIK and/or PRK ) Patients known history concurrent dry eye disease ( e.g . keratoconjunctivitis sicca ) Patients less 5 mm pupil size dimlight Female subject pregnant , breastfeed intend become pregnant first six month study . Concurrent topical systemic medication may impair heal , include corticosteroid , antimetabolite , isotretinoin ( Accutane ) , amiodarone hydrochloride ( Cordarone ) and/or sumatriptan ( Imitrex ) triptan . Medical condition ( ) , , judgment investigator , may impair heal , include limited : collagen vascular disease , autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency disease , ocular herpes zoster simplex . Active ophthalmic disease , neovascularization cornea within 1mm intended ablation zone , lens opacity . Evidence glaucoma intraocular pressure great 22 mm Hg baseline . Evidence keratoconus , corneal irregularity , abnormal videokeratography either eye . Corneal thickness insufficient allow residual remain stromal bed least 300 micron eye . The residual stromal bed thickness determine subtract LASIK flap thickness depth ablation total central corneal thickness measure pachymetry</criteria>
