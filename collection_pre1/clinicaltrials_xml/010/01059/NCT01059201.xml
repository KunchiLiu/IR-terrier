	<brief_summary>Background : - Research genetic cause autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) involve study DNA child autism . New DNA sequence technology allow researcher study specific gene search genetic change may cause contribute ASD . Individuals donate DNA Autism Genetic Resource Exchange may benefit study DNA sample advance DNA sequence technology . - The role cholesterol individual ASD currently investigation . Research suggest abnormal cholesterol level child autism may relate genetic mutation change cholesterol regulate body . Objectives : - To study exist blood sample child autism spectrum disorder evaluate relationship genetic trait cholesterol function . Eligibility : - Children ASD donate blood sample Autism Genetic Resource Exchange . Design : - Parents/guardians minor child ASD provide consent research perform exist DNA sample Autism Genetic Research Exchange databank . Information research may provide consent parents/guardians case case basis , direct researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) neurodevelopmental disorder characterize functional deficit three domain : social interaction , communication , stereotypic behavior . Prevalence estimate approximately 1/166 child public health impact significant . ASD clearly genetic component ; however , identification specific etiology complicate heterogeneous nature ASD . One approach minimize problem define endophenotypes subcategorize ASD patient . Based work Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome , investigate whether alteration cholesterol homeostasis may contribute ASD . We find 200 ASD subject 23 % subject serum cholesterol level less equal 2.28th centile 9 % level great equal 97.72nd centile . Analysis sterol profile suggest hypocholesterolemia due synthetic defect rather decrease oral intake . Thus hypothesize ASD patient abnormal cholesterol level polymorphisms mutation either gene involve cholesterol homeostasis gene encode protein whose function alter change cholesterol level . To test hypothesis propose 1 ) use serum cholesterol level define ASD endophenotypes 2 ) perform genomic resequencing known exon hypo- normocholesterolemic ASD patient .</detailed_description>
