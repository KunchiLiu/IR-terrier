	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Erlotinib , Prior Surgery Radiation Patients With Squamous Cell Cancers ( SCC ) Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Study Treatment/Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take erlotinib surgery and/or radiation therapy ( Induction Treatment ) . After surgery and/or radiation take erlotinib 1 year ( Maintenance Phase ) . Induction Treatment : You take erlotinib 1 time every day , mouth , full glass water . You take erlotinib time every day . If miss dose least 12 hour next dose due , need take miss dose . You take next dose schedule . If vomit take tablet , dose replaced tablet actually see . Erlotinib take 1 hour 2 hour meal drug . If side effect erlotinib , study doctor may lower dose . When stop take erlotinib induction depend disease get bad , doctor think benefit , receive surgery and/or radiation . You take erlotinib 10 week start local therapy . If doctor think benefit , may take erlotinib longer 10 week start surgery and/or radiation . If disease get bad 10 week , stop take erlotinib surgery and/or radiation right away . Surgery/Radiation : During Week 4 , doctor decide disease resectable unresectable schedule type local therapy ( surgery and/or radiation ) receive . If You sign separate consent surgery and/or radiation , describe procedure ( ) risk detail . Resectable Disease : If disease resectable , schedule surgery . If doctor think need , may radiation therapy surgery . Radiation therapy usually start 4-8 week follow surgery , surgical site heal . You take erlotinib 7 day surgery . Unresectable Disease : If disease unresectable , schedule radiation therapy . You take erlotinib begin radiation therapy . If doctor think benefit erlotinib , continue take radiation therapy . After complete radiation therapy , doctor think need , surgery . Maintenance Treatment : You restart erlotinib 4-8 week surgery , surgical site heal . If radiation therapy surgery , take erlotinib radiation treatment . If receive radiation therapy , continue erlotinib finish radiation therapy . You take erlotinib mouth every day 1 year . Study Visits : Induction Therapy : On Day 1 Induction Therapy every 2 week : - You ask ask side effect may drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask smoke status . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - The tumor measure physical exam use ruler and/or caliper . - Pictures take area photograph screen . - If take anti-coagulant medication , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw check blood clot function . - If doctor think need , ECG . After Week 4 , CT scan MRI scan check status disease . If continue take erlotinib least 4 week ( total 8 week ) surgery radiation start , CT MRI repeat . After Week 4 within 14 day start maintenance therapy , complete questionnaire feel overall quality life . The questionnaire take 10-15 minute total complete . Maintenance Therapy : On Day 1 Maintenance Therapy every 8 week : - You ask side effect drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask smoke status . - Your performance status record . - The tumor measure . - Pictures take area photograph screen . - If doctor think need , CT scan MRI scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , ECG - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test , include test check blood clotting function ( Day 1 ) . - If take anti-coagulant medication , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw check blood clot function ( every 8 week ) . After Weeks 24 52 , complete questionnaire feel overall quality life . If receive radiation therapy , CT scan MRI scan 3 month radiation therapy . Length Study : You take study drug 1 year surgery/radiation . You take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect , doctor think best interest stop . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You ask side effect may drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , CT scan MRI check status disease . Long-Term Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , contact every 3 month Year 1 every 6 month Years 2 3 collect information , treatment receive , side effect experience . You ( family member designees ) may contact telephone , write , e-mail , clinic visit . This information may also collect check medical record . This follow-up also consist physical exam see MD Anderson follow-up . This investigational study . Erlotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment non-small cell lung cancer . It investigational give erlotinib radiation and/or surgery treatment aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma . Up 25 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
