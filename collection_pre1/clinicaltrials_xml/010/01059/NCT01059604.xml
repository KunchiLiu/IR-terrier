	<brief_summary>Anti-migraine drug , include triptans , indicate use pregnancy . However , peak prevalence migraine woman childbearing age . This , couple sporadic nature migraine attack high rate unplanned pregnancy , make unintentional exposure anti-migraine medication pregnancy likely . Prior anti-migraine medication market data available drug safety pregnancy : data animal model may translate directly human pregnant woman routinely exclude clinical trial . The Sumatriptan Pregnancy Registry establish GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) 1996 monitor safety sumatriptan pregnancy . It combine Naratriptan Pregnancy Registry 2001 data collection sumatriptan-naproxen combination ( Treximet ) begin 2008 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Sumatriptan , Naratriptan Treximet Pregnancy Registry aim ass whether substantial increase risk major congenital malformation ( MCMs ) follow utero exposure anti-migraine medication . Exposure first trimester primary interest represent period organogenesis . The Registry primarily prospective enrolment follow-up study . Patients expose sumatriptan , naratriptan , sumatriptan-naproxen combination pregnancy , enrol , voluntary basis , healthcare provider . Enrolment encourage early pregnancy possible prior prenatal testing . The healthcare provider provide initial information concern patient demographic ; detail pregnancy include estimate delivery date result prenatal test ; timing , dosage , route delivery ( e.g . oral , subcutaneous , intranasal ) drug exposure pregnancy . The registry accept exposure report anywhere world . Within United States ( US ) healthcare provider contact registry use toll free number . Outside US enrolment make GlaxoSmithKline local operating company . Close estimated date delivery healthcare provider contact Registry provide follow information concern pregnancy outcome ( live still birth , spontaneous induced abortion ) , presence absence MCM , history headache exposure sumatriptan , naratriptan sumatriptan-naproxen combination pregnancy . Up six attempt make contact healthcare provider obtain pregnancy outcome information . After six attempt , record close lose follow . Pregnancy outcomes classify outcome MCMs , outcomes without MCMs spontaneous abortion . The outcome without MCMs classify live birth , stillbirths/fetal death induce abortion . Spontaneous abortion report separately due potential inconsistent identification malformation situation . It beyond scope Registry consistently access pediatric evaluation medical record . For reason main outcome restrict major congenital malformation external recognizable delivery room shortly birth . To provide consistency , report congenital malformation classify major minor accord criterion use Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) 's Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) . All malformation report review classified paediatrician CDC information request necessary . Analyses restrict prospectively enrolled pregnancy ( enrolment prior knowledge birth outcome ) . Retrospectively enrolled pregnancy review pattern malformation type , include formal analysis retrospective report bias towards unusual severe outcomes less likely representative general population experience . The proportion infant MCMs among prospectively report exposure calculate : total number outcome major birth defect ( number outcomes major birth defect + number live birth without defect ) . All spontaneous pregnancy loss , well induced abortion fetal death without report defect , exclude denominator due potential inconsistent identification malformation situation . The 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) risk estimate calculate use exact method base binomial distribution . Analyses stratify accord trimester exposure ( second trimester start week 14 third trimester week 28 gestation ) anti-migraine interest . If individual expose multiple drug interest pregnancy , exposure include analysis drug interest . The registry internal comparator group , descriptive comparison make MCM rate general population study literature . Prospective report also review detect unusual pattern malformation type may warrant investigation . The data Sumatriptan , Naratriptan Treximet Pregnancy Registry review , conclusion develop , independent scientific advisory committee . A semi-annual interim report summarize aggregate data provide disseminate information regular basis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women expose utero sumatriptan , naratriptan sumatriptanpnaproxen combination pregnancy . Exposure occur time pregnancy , though exposure first trimester primary interest . Pregnancies expose sumatriptan , naratriptan sumatriptannaproxen combination report outcome pregnancy know ( prospective reporting ) . Ideally exposed pregnancy register prior prenatal testing , pregnancy enrol prenatal testing diagnose congenital malforamtion exclude . Retrospectively report exposure ( i.e . exposure register pregnancy outcome know ) include registry , consider descriptively include risk analysis . Retrospectively report exposure ( i.e . exposure register pregnancy outcome know ) include registry , review separately descriptively . These include risk analysis . Patient report exposure outcome verify healthcare provider .</criteria>
