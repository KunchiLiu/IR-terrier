	<detailed_description>This phase IIIB/IV , open-label , multi-center , single-arm descriptive pilot study efficacy safety RAL BID combination ABC/3TC QD antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected individual presumptive confirm diagnosis tuberculosis , without plan comparative analysis . A goal 40 subject enrol 3 site Russian Federation , include site , receive RAL BID + 3TC/ABC QD 48 week . This study include screen , treatment follow-up period . Screening period 28 day include initial visit Day -28 ( screen ) Day -14 ( switch rifabutin ) . The second visit require patient initially rifampin-based TB regimen need switch rifabutin-based regimen . Patients receive rifampin-containing TB therapy switch rifabutin ( 300 mg daily ) minimum 14 day prior initiation antiretroviral therapy . Patients must receive 45 day tuberculosis therapy .
