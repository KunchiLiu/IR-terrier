	<brief_title>Heat Intolerance Group FMF Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) genetic disease , cause mutation FMF gene , entitle MEFV . The disease characterize painful attack inflammation site line serous membrane ( e.g . abdominal pain cause inflammation peritoneum , serous membrane surround internal organ within abdomen , fever attack . Continuous colchicine treatment prevents attack patient . The pathogenesis disease , lead attack , question yet resolve . We know correlation protein Pyrin activity Interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) . Tolerance sustain heat stress varies due individual variation . Under extreme condition exercise-heat stress , even healthy , well acclimate , physically fit individual ultimately store heat rate cause body temperature rise . Individuals able sustain heat whose body temperature start rise earlier high rate others , condition , define `` heat intolerant '' . There causation Heat Intolerance FMF show study till . We suggest prevalence Heat Intolerance group FMF patient significantly high group healthy individual , participate study Heller Institute Medical Research . The aim study verification causation pathology . The information obtain study may allow u determine sequence event associate FMF attack development , perhaps take u one step understand pathogenesis disease . 15 FMF patient double mutation MEFV , mail sex , age 18 30 without attack le 2 month participate study .
