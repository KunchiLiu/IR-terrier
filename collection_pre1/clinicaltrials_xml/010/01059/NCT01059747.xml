	<brief_summary>Addiction regard one serious health social problem Taiwan , heroin currently consider major substance abuse . The widely use treatment date methadone replacement therapy . It report achieve well clinical response avoid possible side effect , blood level methadone remain certain level . However , blood level methadone mediate various factor besides dosage . Genetic variability gene encodes enzymes affect methadone metabolism , target receptor methadone , drug-drug interaction medication patient take affect blood level . Therefore , therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) pharmacogenomic study crucial evaluate predict clinical response , cause side effect toxicity , well study drug-drug interaction . This cross-sectional study order evaluate relationship methadone plasma level clinical response patient methadone maintenance therapy identify optimal therapeutic threshold . HPLC use analyze methadone metabolite . Our hypothesis methadone plasma level patient responsive methadone maintenance therapy high level non-responsive patient , high plasma level lead less severe withdrawal symptom . We also test optimal minimal dosage exists among patient . In meanwhile , aim test methadone level clinical response correlate different genetic polymorphism . Candidate gene involve pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic process methadone ( e.g . CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , CYP2B6 , ABCB1 , opioid mu receptor kappa receptor ) genotyped analysis . The result study provide clinical information methadone treatment pharmacogenomic data Taiwanese clinician achieve good treatment outcome .</brief_summary>
