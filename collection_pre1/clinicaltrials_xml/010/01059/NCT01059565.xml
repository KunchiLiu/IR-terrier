	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine experimental drug call Aztreonam Inhalation Solution ( AZLI ) safe effective treat Burkholderia lung infection patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Spirometry use assess pulmonary function , revise Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire ( CFQ-R ) use assess quality life . The CFQ-R validate , patient-reported outcome tool use measure health-related quality life child adult CF . The study consist 24-week randomized phase , 24-week open-label phase . Primary secondary efficacy analysis conduct 24-week randomized phase . Safety data collect randomized open-label phase .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female ≥ 6 year age 2 . Subjects CF diagnose one following : Documented sweat chloride ≥ 60 milliequivalent ( mEq ) /L quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test Documented sweat sodium ≥ 60 mmol/L Two wellcharacterized genetic mutation CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene Abnormal nasal potential difference ( NPD ) accompany symptom characteristic CF 3 . Chronic infection Burkholderia spp . define : One sputum ( bronchoalveolar lavage ) culture positive Burkholderia spp . within 6 month prior baseline assessment , At least 50 % sputum ( bronchoalveolar lavage ) culture collect least one month apart previous 12 month prior baseline assessment positive Burkholderia spp . ( minimum 2 positive culture ) , At least one positive sputum ( bronchoalveolar lavage ) culture ( obtain point time ) confirm Burkholderia spp . Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ( CFF ) Burkholderia cepacia Research Laboratory Repository University Michigan ( equivalent Canadian reference laboratory ) . 4 . Concomitant aerosolize antibiotic treatment : subject receive intermittent ( alternate month on/month ) aerosolize antibiotic treatment eligible , must least 1 week offtreatment cycle time baseline assessment . Subjects receive continuous aerosolize antibiotic treatment eligible without restriction aerosolize antibiotic treatment . 5 . Chest radiograph , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( recent , obtain within 90 day screen ) without significant acute finding ( eg , infiltrate [ lobar diffuse interstitial ] , pleural effusion , pneumothorax ) , significant intercurrent illness ; chronic , stable finding ( eg , chronic scar atelectasis ) allow . 6 . Subjects ( parent/guardian require ) must able provide write informed consent/assent prior studyrelated procedure , 7 . Ability perform reproducible pulmonary function test 8 . Sexually active female childbearing potential must agree use highly effective method contraception heterosexual intercourse throughout study period 30 day follow discontinuation study drug . A highly effective method birth control define method would result low failure rate ( ie , le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly , implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , vasectomized partner . 1 . Administration investigational drug use investigational device within 28 day randomization/baseline within six halflives investigational drug ( whichever longer ) 2 . Administration AZLI treatment within 28 day prior randomization/baseline 3 . Known local systemic hypersensitivity monobactam antibiotic 4 . History lung transplantation 5 . Abnormal renal hepatic function result recent test within previous 90 day , define : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 5 time upper limit normal range ( ULN ) Serum creatinine &gt; 2 time ULN 6 . Known portal hypertension complication CF hepatopathy 7 . Positive urine pregnancy test ( confirm serum pregnancy test ) screening ; woman childbearing potential test 8 .
