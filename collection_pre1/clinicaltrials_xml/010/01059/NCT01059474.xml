	<brief_summary>DMPS metal chelator approve use Europe . While FDA-approved drug US , easily obtain administer alternative health practitioner patient . A formulation call 'TD DMPS ' ( transdermal DMPS ) use , despite fact publish literature support agent absorb transdermally . The investigator hypothesis DMPS absorb skin . The investigator plan apply TD DMPS healthy volunteer test serum presence DMPS . In addition investigator measure urinary mercury concentration pre post DMPS application .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transdermal Absorption Dimercaptopropane-1-Sulfonate ( DMPS ) Effect Urinary Mercury Excretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . Background Information Literature : 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate ( DMPS ) chelate agent use year Europe treatment poison metal mercury , arsenic , lead . It water soluble analog dimercaptopropanol ( British anti-Lewisite , BAL ) , FDA approve chelate agent administer via deep intramuscular injection . DMPS FDA approve , approve Europe available Germany without prescription , Dimaval . It felt less toxicity BAL , unlike BAL , effective administer orally ( 1 ) . A comprehensive review Aposhian , et al ( 1 ) note DMPS study since late 1950 's Soviet Union China appear innocuous . This review mention 1979 study follow 168 scleroderma patient receive DMPS 10 year . Some patient experience mild side effect minor allergic reaction ( 26 patient , none anaphylaxis ) , nausea ( 11 patient ) , vertigo ( 7 patient ) , weakness ( 4 patient ) , itch ( 3 patient ) . No renal toxicity note . Additionally , chelation therapy oral DMPS find safe used series patient methylmercury toxicity contaminate grain Iraq 1972 ( 2 ) . It also associate adverse effect use orally chelate lead poison child Baltimore , Maryland 1985 ( 3 ) . This 1985 study cite case series DMPS safely effectively use treatment lead poisoning inorganic mercury poison well . DMPS show mutagenicity Ames salmonella microsome plate test . Soviet study show usual human dose 5mg/kg IV increase 100mg/kg IV , ulceration necrosis injection site note . Animal study large ( 50mg/kg ) IV dos show tremor , tachycardia , dyspnea , vomit , defecation . Other animal study , however , note behavioral , weight , blood composition change animal give 15 80mg/kg IV DMPS . Animal human data demonstrate DMPS less toxic currently FDA approve chelate agent , BAL ( 1 ) . Our study propose apply single dose liquid formulation DMPS skin . Though available animal human data form application , use throughout U.S. many naturopath physician chelate agent child autism . In pamphlet protocol physician , side effect mention see mild skin rash , chronic therapy , possible depletion necessary metal ( zinc magnesium ) , provide mineral supplement . Since use small , one-time dose , risk significant metal mineral depletion . The main risk subject mild skin rash , easily monitor . II . Manufacturing information : The transdermal DMPS use study obtain Bellevue Pharmacy , compound pharmacy ( 1034 S. Brentwood Blvd . Suite 102 St. Louis , MO 63117 ) , supply product doctor U.S . According literature provide , product anhydrous gel dispense 30 ml bottle . Each drop reportedly contain 1mg DMPS 4mg glutathione . We buy product need study one bulk batch since subject get one dose . Prior conduct study , bottle sent FDA lab analyze confirmation presence DMPS gel . III . Investigator Qualifications : Principal Investigator : Anne-Michelle Ruha , MD , FACMT Assistant Investigator : Jennifer Smith , MD Both investigator board certify emergency physician , Dr. Ruha board certify medical toxicologist , Dr. Smith near completion fellowship medical toxicology ( see attach curriculum vitae ) . At least one investigator present time application product follow-up blood draw . We prepare deal acute reaction occur , allergic otherwise . After time period available phone via poison center 24 hour day , 7 day week concern complication experience study subject . IV . Study Protocol : Since transdermal DMPS delivery widely use study , clinical question wish answer whether DMPS absorb skin transdermal application , whether increase urinary mercury excretion . We recruit 10 healthy adult volunteer , 18 year age , eat least three serving fish per week ( since diet associate detectable level mercury urine may rise follow chelation ) . Patients known allergy DMPS sulfa drug history neurologic renal disease exclude . We also control number mercury contain dental amalgam . History obtain regard potential mercury exposure recent vaccination . 12 hr urine mercury creatinine level measure volunteer prior treatment . The urine collect acid-washed heavy-metal-free specialty container . It refrigerate collection period ship NMS lab ( cool pack ) measurement mercury level mercury : creatinine ratio . Each volunteer receive 120 mg transdermal DMPS , apply bicep area one arm . The area application exceed 2 % body surface area . The dose DMPS determine base `` challenge dose '' `` Buttar Autism treatment Protocol '' , use Dr. Rashid Buttar clinic treatment autistic child . This protocol advise use 3 mg/kg , max dose 120 mg. After dose , urine collect next 12 hour ( use protocol send-out procedure ) assay mercury creatinine level . Additionally , dose , intravenous catheter place arm subject blood draw . Blood sample obtain 30 minute , 60 minute , 90 minute , 2 hour , 4 hour 6 hour application DMPS . These sample send FDA DMPS analysis . Subjects monitor application subsequent 6 hour development skin rash symptom related DMPS , though unlikely . If rash develops skin wash reaction treat necessary . At end 6 hour , skin cleanse soap water treatment period end . When analyze data collection , first look whether DMPS detectable blood application . If , examine 12 hour urine mercury level application determine whether increased . We control number dental amalgam , affect baseline urinary Hg level . If increase detect , compare magnitude increase available data urinary Hg excretion increase oral DMPS administration .</detailed_description>
