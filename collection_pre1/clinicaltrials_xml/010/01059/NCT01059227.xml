	<brief_summary>Background : - Research show hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) involve stress anxiety , drug block effect CRH body reduce anxiety . GSK561679 experimental drug attempt reduce anxiety block effect CRH . Researchers interested compare GSK561679 treatment anxiety . Objectives : - To determine effectiveness GSK561679 compare placebo alprazolam ( Xanax ) , possible treatment fear anxiety . Eligibility : - Healthy female volunteer 21 50 year age . Design : - This study involve one screen visit , four test visit , one follow-up visit period 8-9 week . The testing session 6-11 day apart . - Participants must follow dietary restriction participate study . - No nicotine , alcohol , caffeine ( include chocolate soft drink ) 24 hour start study . - No nicotine past 6 month , nicotine final blood sample collect follow-up visit . - No alcohol caffeine 24 hour test visit 72 hour visit . - No grapefruit grapefruit product 14 day first dose study medication collection final blood sample . - Participants receive dose GSK561679 , alprazolam , placebo 3 hour test , take additional pill 1 hour test . - During test , participant receive brief electric shock hear sudden loud noise . The noises shock give period approximately 40 minute per session . - Skin conduction , heart rate , blinking monitor throughout test , participant ask anxiety level test mood , memory , concentration . Blood saliva sample also take session . - Participants stay clinical center 1 2 hour study test ensure sedation worn . Participants allow drive home take public transportation alone study visit , alternative transportation must arrange .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This proposal part integrate project test efficacy candidate anxiolytic , CRF1 receptor antagonist , provide GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) part The Emory-MSSM-GSK-NIMH Collaborative Mood Disorders Initiative , use fear-potentiated startle . The anti-fear anxiolytic activity single dose highly specific CRF1 antagonist GSK561679 evaluate healthy female subject use model phasic ( fear ) sustain ( anxiety ) aversive state derive human pre-clinical study rodent . Study population : The study population consist 30 healthy female volunteer , 21-50 year age , diverse racial ethnic background . Design : The study use double-blind cross-over design subject receive placebo , Alprazolam ( 1 mg ) , low ( 50 mg ) high ( 400 mg ) dose GSK561679 . We examine effect drug potentiation startle anticipation no-shock , predictable shock signal discrete threat cue , unpredictable shock . Outcome measure : The main outcome measure magnitude startle reflex retrospective anxiety condition . Secondary measure include skin conductance response change heart rate , well measure HPA activity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : HEALTHY FEMALE VOLUNTEERS determine responsible physician , base medical evaluation include familial medical history , physical examination , psychiatric history , psychiatric evaluation , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Females age 21 50 free current psychopathology free past psychopathology mood anxiety disorder , psychotic disorder , substance drug addiction Organic central nervous system disorder Able give consent A negative urine toxicology For female childbearing potential , negative pregnancy urine test For female childbearing potential , use two effective birth control methods* duration study abstinence . Abstinence ingest nicotine least 6 month start study . *See specific criterion effective birth control method list . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects unstable medical disorder disorder ( include surgical intervention ) would likely interfere action , absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion GSK561679 , may pose safety concern , interfere accurate assessment safety . 1 . Lifetime current diagnosis schizophrenia psychotic disorder , mood anxiety disorder , substance abuse last 12 month lifetime dependence , alcohol abuse last 12 month lifetime dependence . Current Axis I disorder . Clear evidence firstdegree relative history psychosis , bipolar disorder major depression determine family history interview method ; specifically , participant know diagnosis treatment order confirm presence disorder . 2 . Subject currently participate another clinical trial expose investigational noninvestigational drug device , do within precede month 3 . Current evidence history significant unstable medical illness organic brain impairment , include stroke , epilepsy , CNS tumor , demyelinate disease , cardiac , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , renal hepatic impairment would likely interfere action , absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion GSK561679 . Abnormal EKG . 4 . DSMIV substance abuse within past year . Subject positive urine test illegal drug use . 5 . Diagnosis anorexia nervosa bulimia 6 . Subject documented history hepatobiliary disease include history , positive laboratory result hepatitis ( hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis C antibody ) , and/or clinically significant hepatic enzyme elevation include one follow enzymes great 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) value ( ALT , AST , ALP , total direct bil &gt; 1.5 time ULN , unless consistent presumed diagnose Gilbert disease 7 . Subject take systemic corticosteroid within 2 week Randomization Visit 8 . All prescription nonprescription medication herbal remedy prohibit within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication completion followup procedure , unless opinion investigator medication interfere study procedure compromise study safety , e.g . rescue medication . As exception , acetaminophen , 2g/day , birth control pill permit study . 9 . Subject likely require use follow medication : Chronic ( 2 week ) , regular NSAID use unless administer concomitantly antisecretory agent ( i.e . protonpump inhibitor histamine2 receptor antagonist ) Any use aspirin ( include low dose ) 10 . Subject take nonpsychoactive ( prescription nonprescription ) , dietary , herbal product , narrow therapeutic index , metabolize via cytochrome P450 3A4 2C9 pathway ( warfarin ) , transport via OATP1B1 Pgp , within 2 week ( 5 halflives , whichever long ) prior Randomization Visit . 11 . Subject take ( nonpsychoactive ) prescription , nonprescription , dietary , herbal product potent inducer inhibitor cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway 2 week ( 5 half life , whichever long ) prior Randomization Visit . 12 . Subject participate study investigational drug within period 30 day prior screen study 13 . Pregnancy lactation* 14 . Subjects , opinion investigator , would noncompliant visit schedule study procedure ( e.g . illiteracy , plan vacation , plan hospitalization study ) . 15 . Any laboratory abnormality investigator judgment consider clinically significant ( blood pressure , ECG , TSH , LFT , etc . ) 16 . Previous treatment CRF1 receptor antagonist 17 . Allergy benzodiazepines 18 . Medical condition would influence psychophysiological response ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease , previous myocardial infarction , angina , uncontrolled hypertension ) . 19 . A history peptic ulcer disease ( PUD ) A serum pregnancy test perform screening . Since test might detect early stage pregnancy ( i.e . maximum 10 day period fertilization implantation ) , woman childbearing age exclude study use least two effective birth control method 15 day prior receive study drug . Acceptable method birth control include : doublebarrier method ( condom diaphragm ) combine spermicide ; hormonal contraceptive plus single barrier ( birth control pill , implant [ Norplant ] injection [ DepoProvera ] ) , Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) , abstinence ( sexual activity ) .</criteria>
