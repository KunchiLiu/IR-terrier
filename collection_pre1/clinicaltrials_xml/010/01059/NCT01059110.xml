	<brief_title>Comparison Five Treatments Patients With Plantar Warts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Four half million individual France wart ( SOFRES poll 2002 ) . Notably , plantar wart consider common reason consult private practitioner , despite absence robust epidemiological data . Although benign , plantar wart associate certain degree morbidity : pain , difficulty walking , intra- interindividual contagion . Despite frequency plantar warts patient high expectation treatment , numerous immunocompetent patient , remedy evaluate undeniably inadequate way . Patient demand therapy strong , affect go one physician another , search `` good treatment '' . For reason evoke context skin disease , heal wart indeed represent public health objective . One difficulty evaluate treatment frequency spontaneous complete remission ( natural history ) and/or placebo , assess 30 % [ range : 0-73 % ] short-term trial ( 10 week ) . In addition , professional experience support frequent relapse poorly evaluate therapeutic trial . Keratolytic treatment , usually salicylated petroleum jelly , standard therapy accord Cochrane Review . In practice , therapy usually combine manual shaving , do patient him/herself physician . Supplementing basic therapy physical ( standard cryotherapy ) , chemical ( 5-fluorouracil ; Efudix® ) immunological adjunct ( imiquimod ; Aldara® ) , achieve desire effect increase frequency and/or rapidity complete cure , never examine large randomized-controlled trial . A population comprise patient wart still `` resistant '' 5 week keratolytic therapy 50 % salicylic acid ( PommadeM.O Cochon® ) follow 1-week washout deliberately retain precise setting pose therapeutic difficulty routine practice . The 1-week washout allow skin heal little facilitate diagnosis failure ; , moreover , strategy pretreatment scrap would unduly weaken .</detailed_description>
