	<brief_summary>The study design assess effect safety oral administration VECAM 40/300 administer bedtime compare Esomeprazole 20 mg administer 30-60 minute dinner , control nighttime daytime HB 24 hour GERD symptom . The rational study base contention VECAM exhibit potent inhibition acid secretion mechanism action , administer bedtime without food . Such timing drug dose allow effective inhibition nighttime acid secretion . Because mechanism action , VECAM exhibit improve 24-hour inhibition acid secretion hence , bedtime administration compromise effect daytime . This improved control acid secretion predictably result good control nighttime well daytime heartburn ( HB ) symptom .</brief_summary>
