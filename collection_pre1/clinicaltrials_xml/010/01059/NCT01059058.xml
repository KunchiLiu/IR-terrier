	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn management white spot lesion occur orthodontic treatment . White spot lesion generally improve slightly time . To date , proven method help white spot lesion improve faster . Two treatment , call MI Paste Plus fluoride varnish , show potential benefit laboratory set undergone test clinical setting . Approximately 240 subject enrol study . The study take place approximately 30 dental orthodontic office across Idaho , Montana , Oregon , Utah , Washington part Northwest PRECEDENT , five-state research network create study practical issue face dentists/orthodontists patient , provide information improve quality oral health care whole .

	<brief_title>Study Treatments Used White Spot Lesions After Orthodontic Treatment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>White spot lesion ( WSL ) , cause decalcification enamel , common unfortunate sequela orthodontic treatment . If address , WSL may progress caries frank cavitation enamel surface . Once form , white spot lesion compromise esthetic extremely difficult even impossible reverse . Many clinician consider high-dose fluoride application first step treatment WSL order arrest area decalcification . However , believe remineralization high level fluoride may repair surface enamel , may possibly block remineralization deeper area enamel . This , turn , may hamper effort normalize appearance WSL . Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate ( CPP-ACP ) containing product recently propose therapy treatment white spot follow orthodontic treatment . CPP think stabilize localize calcium , fluoride , phosphate tooth surface slow-release amorphous form , thus enhance deep remineralization WSL . Products contain CPP-ACP currently market various name , include MI Paste Plus ( also contain fluoride ) . Few vivo study investigate effectiveness various remineralization product address WSL orthodontics . This project single-blind , randomize clinical trial three arm - MI Paste Plus 8-week duration , single application Duraphat Fluoride Varnish reassessment 8 week , normal home care 8 week period . Subjects recruit regularly schedule orthodontic appointment , eligible subject 2 year post-removal fixed orthodontic appliance . This project intend answer four question regard management white spot lesion . Specific Aim 1 : compare effectiveness MI Paste Plus Duraphat Fluoride Varnish standard oral hygiene/toothpaste regimen improve appearance WSL orthodontic treatment . Specific Aim 2 : investigate subject ' self-assessment improvement three arm . Specific Aim 3 : investigate variable ( age , gender , time since fix orthodontic appliance removal , compliance , oral hygiene practice , etc ) may influence WSL improvement . Specific Aim 4 : investigate short-term change WSL day orthodontic appliance removal day retainer delivery ( usually 2 - 7 day ) . This study provide valuable evidence management WSL orthodontic treatment . As previously state , WSL lesions quite common difficult reverse , important conduct rigorous clinical research effort develop effective strategy . This study randomize clinical trial . NW PRECEDENT provider invite subject participate age 12 20 least one new WSL 4 maxillary incisor associate orthodontic treatment . These common teeth develop lesion . The NW PRECEDENT provider must verify WSL present pre-orthodontic treatment record . Subjects must willing place follow three group : 1 . Test Group A : 10 % CPP-ACP + 900 ppm Fluoride paste - trained staff member NW PRECEDENT dental/orthodontic office give 3 tube MI Paste Plus instruction subject home use . The subject also receive non-prescription fluoride toothpaste ( 1100 ppm Fluoride ) oral hygiene instruction . The group consist 80 subject , subject give enough MI Paste duration trial . Treatment begin day retainer delivery subject recruit day fix appliance removal . Otherwise , treatment begin date recruitment . 2 . Test Group B : Fluoride Varnish Group - trained staff member NW PRECEDENT dental/orthodontic office provide single fluoride varnish application ( 22,600 ppm Fluoride ) subject . The subject also receive non-prescription fluoride toothpaste ( 1100 ppm Fluoride ) oral hygiene instruction . The group consist 80 subject . Treatment begin day retainer delivery subject recruit day fix appliance removal . Otherwise , treatment begin date recruitment . 3 . Control Group - These 80 subject receive non-prescription fluoride toothpaste ( 1100 ppm Fluoride ) oral hygiene instruction time enrollment . After trial complete ( ~ August 2011 ) , subject inform result , offer one two active arm , find effective reduce WSL . The NW PRECEDENT provider subject also fill short survey compile information subject 's age , gender , race , ethnicity , time fixed appliance , oral hygiene treatment , type retainer orthodontic treatment . Upon determine subject 's eligibility willingness participate , well obtain assent/consent , he/she randomly assign group , baseline photograph take , assign treatment begin . In case subject orthodontic appliance remove , subject undergo enrollment photo , assign treatment begin day retainer delivery . The subject 's general dentist ( perform orthodontic care ) send letter inform patient currently enrol study , additional treatment white spot lesion delay study complete ( 8 week ) . Subjects identified time fix orthodontic appliance remove baseline photograph take day recruitment . Subjects identify day appliance remove photograph take day , well time retainer delivery ( 2 - 7 day later ) . A subsequent analysis day fix appliance removal one week follow-up photograph perform , order determine significant change evident short period immediately fix appliance removal . This investigated portion teeth brace shield oral cavity several year , may also desiccate removal brace . Additionally , gum may puffy swell immediately take brace , part teeth may visible . The photograph send online data capture system . At eight-week time point , NW PRECEDENT provider recall subject ( 240 total ) take eight-week follow-up photograph standardize format baseline photograph . The photographs sent via online data capture system . The NW PRECEDENT provider administer office survey subject gather information regard satisfaction use treatment , compliance , oral hygiene practice , self-assessment improvement WSL . A group blind examiner consist five ten layperson five ten dental expert view subject 's set digital photograph chronological order PowerPoint presentation . The photograph show four maxillary incisor teeth unidentifiable examiner . Each set photograph give improvement rating 100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) ( 0=no improvement , 100=100 % improvement ) . In addition , graduate orthodontic resident dental student blindly assess digital photograph measure size white spot lesion relative rest tooth express percent . Statistical analysis perform .</detailed_description>
