	<brief_summary>In relation activation PDGF-mediated signalization due fusion gene COL1A1-PDGFb DFSP , imatinib ( 800mg/day ) show activity advance DFSP become reference treatment option patient . Yet activity observe allow downstaging compatible successful resection number patient prevent subsequent tumour progression case residual tumour.Pazopanib relation 1 ) multi tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity ( VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , PDGFR-α , PDGFR-β c-kit IC50 value 10 , 30 , 47 , 71 , 84 , 74 nM , respectively ) involve particular PDGFR , VEGFR show activated DFSP , 2 ) antitumour activity sarcoma patient , 3 ) acceptable safety profile , logical candidate therapeutic trial DFSP patient expect derive sufficient benefit imatinib patient fail imatinib mesylate . Moreover , use quantitative RT-PCR immunohistochemistry recently demonstrate high level VEGF VEGFR2 expression dermatofibrosarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance ( DFSP ) rare soft tissue sarcoma intermediate malignant potential . Treatment rely wide local excision negative margin frequent need reconstructive surgery . A translocation chromosomes 17 22 place platelet-derived growth factor-B ( PDGFB ) control collagen 1A1 promoter present &gt; 90 % case lead regulation PDGF-β expression activation tyrosinase kinase PDGFRβ . Imatinib mesylate approve unresectable metastatic DFSP due activity PDGFR . This study evaluate benefit pazopanib , multikinase inhibitor advance DFSP . Administration pazopanib per o 800mg/ qd 6 month stable response accord primary endpoint , period study exceed one year.In case progression evaluate accord primary endpoint period treatment superior one month , absence response 3 month , patient withdrawn study , order get alternative therapeutic . These patient consider failure analysis . After 6-month treatment period , reach stable response , treatment continuation decision base operability patient . Administration pazopanib per o 800mg/ qd 6 month stable response accord primary endpoint , 3 monthly successive examination , period study exceed 18 months.In case progression evaluate accord primary endpoint period treatment superior one month , absence response 3 month , patient withdrawn study , order get alternative therapeutic . These patient consider failure analysis . After 6-month treatment period , reach stable response , treatment continuation decision base operability patient Statistical analysis : The trial plan use one-stage design ( Fleming TR . Et al ) Analysis main endpoint rely one-sided binomial test compare observe response rate expect response rate null hypothesis . The type I error rate fix 0.025.For main endpoint , point estimate two-sided 90 % confidence interval present , consistent one-sided test 0.025 level . For secondary endpoint , point estimate 95 % confidence interval presented.We intend estimate probability tumour size reduction least 30 % . The sample size calculate FLEMMING method : Ho define RR ≤20 % ( decrease tumour size least 30 % ) , H1 , response rate , 26 patient must include order demonstrate efficacy define RR≥50 % , 90 % power alfa 2.5 % one side .</detailed_description>
