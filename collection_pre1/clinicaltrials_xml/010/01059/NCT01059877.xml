	<brief_title>Efficacy 1072nm Infrared Stimulation Executive Functioning Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>What hypotheses test ? We seek determine provision brief , repeat exposure 1072nm infrared stimulation cortex surface improve cognitive behavioral functioning indicated normalization EEG activity , increase cerebral oxygenation demonstrate improvement standardized neuropsychological measure . Intensive near infrared stimulation show effective accelerate heal injury functional modification include increase blood flow perfusion . Dementia research suggest hypoperfusion significant underlying mechanism progression dementia . Infrared spectroscopy show effective non-invasive measurement change cerebral oxygenation perfusion . This study therefore seek explore whether increase regional cerebral perfusion oxygenation use infrared light stimulation result improve cognitive behavioral functioning .</detailed_description>
