	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate new investigational drug treat neuroblastoma . This study drug call DFMO . The objective study monitor safety find maximum tolerate dose population . A secondary objective look efficacy DFMO . The safety propose dose regimen trial test on-going risk/benefit assessment study . A patient benefiting treatment , progress therapy , absence safety issue associate DFMO and/or etoposide may continue treatment expectation overall clinical benefit . The procedure involve study include Medical history , Physical exam , Vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature ) , Blood test , Urine test , MRI CT scan tumor ( ) , MIBG scan , Bone marrow aspiration . All test procedure consider standard care population . Drug administration also part protocol , include investigational new drug call DFMO , later combine already approve drug , etoposide . The propose dosing regimen oral dose DFMO two time day day study . There 5 cycle . Each cycle 21 day length . The first cycle DFMO alone . In second cycle etoposide add give orally day first 14 day cycle ( cycle 2-5 ) .</brief_summary>
