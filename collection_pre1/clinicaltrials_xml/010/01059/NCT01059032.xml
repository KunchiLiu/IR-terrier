	<brief_summary>Through rapid growth multislice Computer Tomography ( CT ) imaging , radiation protection become major issue radiological community . Optimizing CT scan key task keep radiation dos low reasonable achievable ( ALARA principle ) . Post processing filter improve restore grainy noisy low dose CT image enhance structure reduce image noise . In study 10 patient , investigator perform preliminary evaluation novel post processing filter , picture element correlation three spatial dimension . By compare normal dose picture unprocessed low-dose picture picture process two dimentional ( 2D ) three dimentional ( 3D ) filter , investigator able ass possible clinical value 3D filter . This project collaboration Buskerud Hospital ( BU ) , Buskerud University College , Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority ( NRPA ) Center Medical Image Science Visualization ( CMIV ) . The project part PhD Lars Borgen .</brief_summary>
