	<brief_title>Expression Longevity Genes Response Extended Fasting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) large contributor morbidity mortality Western world associate high-calorie diet , high body mass , variety factor . CHD lead myocardial infarction ( MI ) embolic event . A grow body evidence suggest relatively low caloric intake diet variety animal increase longevity preliminary evidence among human indicate caloric restriction reduces risk factor CHD , include cholesterol level , blood pressure , glucose , obesity . Caloric restriction also show alter expression certain gene , especially forkhead box ( FOX ) O sirtuin ( SIRT ) gene whose over-expression show increase longevity animal model . Extended avoidance caloric intake , also call fast short-term starvation , show increase expression FOXA gene similar sequence function FOXO gene show increase longevity among animal regardless FOXO function . We recently demonstrate risk CHD significantly low among patient report history routine periodic extend fasting . The two primary hypothesis observation fasting may improve individual ability control dietary intake fasting may initiate cascade protective mechanism preserve cellular metabolic health .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The volunteer ( male nonpregnant female , ethnicity ) must &gt; 18 year age . 2 . The volunteer must either body mass index 25.035.0 kg/m2 combination body mass index 18.524.9 kg/m2 two previously currently measure symptom metabolic syndrome ( fast glucose≥110 mg/dL , triglycerides≥150 mg/dL , highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dL male &lt; 50 mg/dL female , systolic blood pressure≥130 mmHg diastolic blood pressure≥85 mmHg , waist circumference≥40 inch male ≥36 inch female [ glucose cholesterol level may selfreported ] ) . 3 . The volunteer routinely participate caloric restriction ( deliberate limitation caloric intake &lt; 80 % FDArecommended daily caloric intake ) within last 2 year , participate extend fasting ( &gt; 12 hour time ) least year , deliberately skip meal routine dietary practice . 1 . Body mass index &lt; 18.5 &gt; 35 kg/m2 . 2 . Current active cancer treatment , treatment immunosuppressive medication , solid organ transplantation within 1 year . 3 . Presence immunosuppressive disease , myocardial infarction , peripheral vascular disease , stroke within past year . 4 . Use insulin . 5 . Although unlikely fast harm pregnant lactate woman , dietary restriction place participant duration study may conflict dietary recommendation pregnant lactate woman . Women child bear potential , therefore , meet exclusion become pregnant .</criteria>
