	<brief_title>Induction Docetaxel/Cisplatin/5-fluorouracil ( TPF ) Selector Chemo Radiation Therapy ( RT ) Versus Partial Laryngectomy Advanced Laryngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal treatment patient laryngeal cancer remain controversial . Standard treatment option include laryngectomy without radiation ( RT ) radiation alone surgical salvage ( RTSS ) . Because significant functional morbidity associate laryngectomy , Department Veterans Affair Cooperative Studies Program complete randomized , prospective study 332 patient compare new organ preservation treatment strategy conventional laryngectomy radiation . The experimental treatment arm involve three cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow definitive radiation among patient partial ( &gt; 50 % ) clinical tumor response . Final result study demonstrate comparable 2 , 3 , 4 , 10 year survival rate treatment group , successful laryngeal preservation 66 % survive patient randomize receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . This study lead dramatic re-assessment treatment approach advance laryngeal hypopharyngeal cancer patient , face total laryngectomy . Based result , Second approach design test Phase II study University Michigan .In study , 97 patient treat one cycle induction chemotherapy . Seventy-five percent &gt; 50 % reduction tumor treat chemo-RT ( cisplatin 100 mg/m2 x 3 cycle ) , 25 % non-responders underwent total laryngectomy follow RT . The overall 3-year survival rate 85 % , larynx preservation rate 70 % . This study include 30 percentage patient advance stage 4 disease , however specifically evaluate outcome therefore directly address role organ preservation advance disease consider controversial issue head neck literature . In study patient ( 25 % ) respond initial chemotherapy refer total laryngectomy therefore 30 % patient eventually underwent total laryngectomy.Lately several series suggest option partial laryngectomy alternative total laryngectomy initial treatment advance larynx cancer , case cricoids cartilage arytenoid involved.Supracricoid subtotal laryngectomy spare least one arytenoid offer organ preservation also perform accord many article salvage surgery case radiation failure , therefore perform right indication improve percentage total laryngectomy free patient without compromise survival . This reflect course quality life It suggest lately use aggressive induction chemotherapy may improve outcome . The combination Taxotere Cisplatin 5-fluorouracil show effective standard cisplatin 5-fluorouracil without elevation side effect .It suggest three cycle induction chemotherapy may lower rate distant metastases high advanced disease Objectives Primary To determine laryngeal preservation rate treatment paradigm use clinical response single cycle induction chemotherapy select patient either concurrent cisplatin-radiation surgery ( possible organ preserve partial laryngectomy ) compare historical control To determine survival rate among T4 laryngeal patient treatment paradigm use clinical response single cycle induction chemotherapy select patient either , two cycle induction follow concurrent cisplatin-radiation surgery . Secondary To determine survival rate treatment paradigm use clinical response single cycle induction chemotherapy select patient either concurrent cisplatin-radiation surgery include organ preserve partial laryngectomy ( possible ) compare historical control . To determine use three cycle induction chemotherapy lower rate distant metastasis advanced case ; namely : positive nodal disease T4 . To evaluate quality life ( QOL ) treatment paradigm . To evaluate partial supracricoid laryngectomy salvage chemoradiation failure . compare PET scan result pathological specimen larynx . To determine correlation change biological marker EGFR degradation EGFR mutation , p53 overexpression , Bcl-XL , Bcl-2 expression , HPV observe tumor biopsy take shortly administration TPF , compare pre-treatment biopsy . And compare found completion treatment case failure . Study Design Chemotherapy/Radiation/Surgery schedule Days # 1-4 : Patients undergo induction chemotherapy ( TPF ) docetaxel ( Taxotere ) 75 mg/m2 cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 , 5-FU CI 750mg /m2 /24 hour day 1-4 . See section 7.2 . Day # 22 : Patients undergo direct laryngoscopy biopsy biopsy do 3 day . Patients also undergo repeat CT scan neck within week ( +/- ) perspective biopsy . Patient &lt; 50 % response ( NR ) induction chemotherapy undergo salvage supracricoid partial laryngectomy possible laryngectomy follow RT . Cisplatin add radiation patient whose surgical pathology reveals high-risk feature ( i.e . extracapsular spread , &gt; 2 positive lymph node , perineural invasion , positive margin ) . Cisplatin dose 35 mg/m2 weekly discretion prescribe physician . See section 7.2 prescribing detail cisplatin . Responding patient &gt; 50 % response divide two group N2 disease stage T4 undergo two cycle induction TPF others directly undergo treatment RT ( Total dose 70 Gy ) combination cisplatin weekly ( 35mg/m2 ) .Those receive two chemotherapy course assess clinically CT scan PD continue chemo RT , PD undergo surgery Eight week follow completion RT , patient undergo repeat direct laryngoscopy PET scan . The primary tumor site biopsied . Neck nodes persistent , clinically suspicious node , include PET positive node , biopsied . Patients positive laryngeal biopsy follow chemoradiation undergo salvage surgery possible supracricoid partial laryngectomy , otherwise laryngectomy . If laryngeal biopsy negative clinically positive neck lymph node remain , patient undergo neck nodal dissection . Once patient disease-free following chemoradiation nodal neck dissection ( need ) , patient follow every 6 week first year , follow every 3 month second , every 6 month 2 5 year . Patients whose physical examination whose image study concern recurrent disease undergo biopsy . If positive , undergo salvage laryngectomy . Chemotherapy Cisplatin , Docetaxel , 5-Fluorouracil ( TPF ) Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) : Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administer i.v . infusion one hour day # 1 . With Docetaxel administration , patient receive dexamethasone 8 mg PO BID 3 consecutive day , start 1 day docetaxel administration , 10-20 mg IV Day 1 prior treatment Docetaxel . Cisplatin : Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 , administer i.v . infusion run one hour day # 1 follow docetaxel . An aggressive antiemetic regimen require administration cisplatin , consist serotonin antagonist , APREPITANT steroid . 5-Fluorouracil : 5-Fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 0.9 % normal saline 24-hour continuous infusion , day 's # 1-4 . The infusion start cisplatin administration . Evaluation Response Treatment Careful evaluation tumor extent separately record primary tumor regional node specify interval . These base laryngoscopies perform pre-treatment , day 21 start induction chemotherapy , 8 week completion chemoradiation . Standardized response criterion use . CT scan use discretion clinician supplement clinical exam . 7.4.2 Biopsy persistent neck node require 8 week post -radiation evaluation either clinical radiologically positive . . Patients whose PET show CR 8 week post undergo clinical observation . Diagnostic CT scan and/or PET scan obtain prior schedule endoscopy tumor assessment . Post treatment ct perform . Outpatient clinical examination perform completion radiation therapy , 6 week interval year 1 follow-up , every 3 month year 2 follow-up , 6-monthly year 3 follow-up . 8 Translational Studies Tissue sample obtain time laryngeal biopsy send laboratory analysis histologic growth pattern , p53 overexpression , Bcl-XL , Bcl-2 expression , HPV , EGFR expression , phosphorylated EGFR stem cell level . The tissue obtain routine biopsy prior begin treatment , completion induction chemotherapy Radiation .the follow technique use : Immunohistochemistry , PCR Western blot . 10 Response Assessment Criteria : The patient 's tumor tattooed surgeon , measure product long primary tumor dimension perpendicular ; follow chemotherapy , extent tumor measure response . Treatment decision ( i.e . surgery v Chemo+RT ) base response tumor primary site . Tumor response chemotherapy chemoradiation determine clinically surgeon perform DL . Radiologic image study use conjunction physical examination determine tumor response chemotherapy chemoradiation . Clinical PR : Significant ( &gt; 50 % ) reduction product long primary tumor dimension perpendicular compare pre-treatment clinical ( endoscopic ) measurement image study necessary . Non-Responders ( &lt; PR ) : A 50 % less reduction product long primary tumor dimension perpendicular compare pre-treatment clinical ( endoscopic ) measurement image study necessary . Criteria Discontinuation Treatment 1 . Unacceptable adverse event ( ) . 2 . Intercurrent illness , prevent administration treatment . 3 . Patient preference . 4 . Progressive disease . 5 .

General Considerations : All patient study receive either definitive radiotherapy post operative irradiation . For patient find PR induction therapy repeat DL , definitive radiotherapy Cisplatin begin . Post operative radiation begin soon adequate healing establish . Usually , within three four week surgical procedure must begin six week . 13.2 Radiation Fields : The treatment volume individual patient depend upon extent disease . Tumor volume outline plan CT scan aid pre-chemotherapy CT , available , PET scan , ensure adequate irradiation pre-chemotherapy tumor volume . Treatment techniques aim adequate irradiation clinical sub-clinical disease . The therapy goal , specify intend dos primary tumor lymph node metastasis , intend dos lymph node level treat adjuvantly , detailed therapy chart . A CT-based display isodoses record , feasible ass whether intend ( prescribe ) isodoses cover target adequately . Doses : Radiation chemotherapy : Tumor dos express Gy . The prescribed dos encompass target . Treatment plan generate demonstrate adequate coverage target volume . The dose across target volume vary +/- 10 % prescribe dose.The treatment give either use IMRT plan 3D . Treatment give daily , five day per week , two Gy per fraction gross disease , 1.6-2.0 Gy per fraction subclinical disease . Total gross dose 70 Gy subclinical disease dose 50-60 Gy . Post Operative Radiation Therapy : The patient treat conventional fractionation , 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction , five fraction per week continuous course . The dose tumor bed lymph node 56-64 Gy , depend existence extranodal extension existence close surgical margin . Patients gross residual disease positive resection margin receive total 66-70 Gy sit residual disease . Salvage Surgery The extent salvage surgery either primary tumor regional node dictate extent disease . Salvage surgery may require time scheduled tumor assessment time tumor progression recurrence demonstrate adequate biopsy area clinically suspicious tumor involvement .
