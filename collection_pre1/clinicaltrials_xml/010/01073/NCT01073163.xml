	<brief_title>Study Assess Effect Treatment With Bendamustine Combination With Rituximab QT Interval Patients With Advanced Indolent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study originally conduct substudy subset patient enrol phase 3 study C18083/3064/NL/MN ( NCT00877006 ) randomly assign treatment bendamustine combination rituximab ( BR ) satisfy additional eligibility criterion related cardiac function . The objective substudy obtain result assess effect bendamustine treatment cardiac polarization potential change QT interval ( correct Fridericia method [ QTcF ] ) . After period time , substudy amend separate stand-alone study ensure adequate number patient include . Patients treat 6 , 8 , cycle stand-alone study , efficacy safety also assess . In addition , requirement ass pharmacokinetics bendamustine rituximab use combination therapy add objective , determine potential drug interaction bendamustine rituximab .</detailed_description>
