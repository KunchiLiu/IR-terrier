	<detailed_description>Number Pacemakers ( PM ) Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators ( ICD ) rapidly grow due enlarge indication . This fact cause exponential increase schedule in-hospital follow-up . For reason , company produce PM ICD release system allow remote monitor follow-up cardiac device ( PM ICD ) U.S. guideline already change , order suggest remote follow-up device appropriate interval . Nevertheless , information action take scheduled in-hospital follow-up incomplete . ATHENS study design answer 3 question : 1 . How often , schedule hospital follow-up physician `` change '' something ? ( device programming ; drug therapy ; schedule device replacement ... ) 2 . The `` rate change '' different follow-up require pby general practitioner normally take care patient patient ? 3 . Change frequent PM ICD follow-up cardiac resynchronization therapy device ?</detailed_description>
