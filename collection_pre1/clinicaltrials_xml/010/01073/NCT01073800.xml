	<brief_summary>Patients admit critical care unit hospital medical condition high likelihood cause severe problem blood flow , breathing , brain function . These condition also high likelihood cause death . Approximately 10 15 % critically ill patient die hospital . A large amount scientific evidence suggest substantial proportion death due combination blot clot inflammation blood vessel . Statins drug interfere cholesterol fat metabolism . Cholesterol fat blood associate blood clot inflammation blood vessel . Statins know beneficial improve survival heart attack , prevent heart attack . The question VASTVALUS ask : statin improve survival among critically ill patient ? In VASTVALUS , concentrate patient currently require statin medical condition e.g . heart attack , concerned rest critically ill . In VASTVALUS , participate patient receive either atorvastatin 80 mg daily placebo . Atorvastatin statin well-established record safety effectiveness . A placebo know medical activity . We follow patient VASTVALUS determine whether atorvastatin effect occurrence death , stroke , heart attack , kidney failure among critically ill . Results VASTVALUS share medical community study complete . As clinical trial , patient VASTVALUS participate choice , change mind time .</brief_summary>
