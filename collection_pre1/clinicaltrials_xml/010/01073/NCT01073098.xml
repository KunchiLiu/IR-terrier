	<brief_summary>Out hospital cardiac arrest major health problem . Prognosis still poor even return spontaneous circulation . The pathophysiology cardiac arrest implies ischemia-reperfusion sepsis like syndrome . These phenomenon lead microvascular dysfunction explain probably multi-organ failure cardiac arrest . Few mean allow exploration microvascular function human . Muscle StO2 technique allow assessment microvascular function non-invasively . The aim study evaluate muscle StO2 prognostic factor hospital cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Muscle StO2 Prognostic Factor After Out Hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out hospital cardiac arrest major health problem accounting 375000 deaths year Europe . Even return spontaneous circulation , survival poor complication post-anoxic encephalopathy multi-organ failure . The pathophysiology cardiac arrest implies ischemia-reperfusion sepsis like syndrome . These condition frequently associate microvascular dysfunction `` motor '' multi-organ failure . Few mean allow exploration microvascular function human . Recently , StO2 , non-invasive technique assess microvascular function describe . This technique measure tissular saturation muscle use near-infrared spectroscopy technique . It describe good prognostic factor haemorrhagic shock state . Dynamic parameter reperfusion slope allow discriminate survivor survivor severe sepsis . This dynamic test assess microvasculature recruitment could marker good prognosis . The aim study evaluate muscle StO2 prognostic factor hospital cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
