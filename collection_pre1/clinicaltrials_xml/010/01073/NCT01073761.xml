	<brief_summary>The purpose study look level three HIV medication darunavir , ritonavir atazanavir blood drug intake stop order understand long drug persist blood . The study specifically look three drug blood level take 10 day everyday . The main objective provide information potential safety ( term prevent virological failure development resistance ) delay drug dos occasionally provide information decline drug concentration dosing stop .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long term use success antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) constrain many factor include poor adherence drug intolerance . Poor adherence ( miss ART dos ) may lead achievement sub therapeutic drug plasma concentration virological failure . This could also complicate development resistance ART compromise future therapeutic option cross resistance within antiretroviral drug class . In medicine , successful adherence suppose mean take least 80 % dos . This concept , inherit antihypertensive literature anti-infective prescribing therapeutic area HIV prescribe fundamental principle . The current absence curative therapy HIV infection , mean order effective , suppressive therapy need take indefinite lifelong basis . The capacity development resistance virus mean successful adherence equate much high rate adherence 80 % . Moreover , HIV therapy , successful adherence also mean attention maximum interval dos well dietary restriction time dose intake . Ideally , guarantee long-term virological response , HIV-infected patient take ART every day time . However , ART life dos forget delay . A recent survey confirm reason people miss antiretroviral dos : forget , fall asleep , busy , depressed , away home , medicine make sick ( Mascolini www.thebody.com 2003 ) . Drug persistence ( presence drug detectable level high enough work ) plasma mainly depend half-life . Long half-life antiretroviral agent may allow forgotten dos , able delay decline drug level sub-therapeutic concentration long enough patient remember take drug . Boosted PI characterize different half life , therefore different ability persist plasma . Unfortunately , data drug persistence plasma limit whether drug dos forget dose delay unknown . Therefore , main objective study provide information potential safety ( term prevent virological failure development resistance ) delay drug dos occasionally provide information decline drug concentration dosing stop . Rationale pharmacogenomic analysis Pharmacogenetics hold promise HIV treatment complexity potential toxicity multi antiretroviral drug therapy prescribe long period . Thus far , candidate gene examine limited number allelic variant , number confirm association already emerge . From public health perspective , antiretroviral medication become increasingly available racially ethnically diverse population worldwide , understanding genetic structure population may allow u anticipate impact adverse response , even group represent drug registration trial . The exist literature pharmacogenetic determinant antiretroviral drug exposure , drug toxicity , well genetic marker associate rate disease progression underline recent advance occur past year . However , expect larger-scale comprehensive genome approach profoundly change landscape knowledge future . Additional study need assess implication long-term response antiretroviral agent . For reason plan collect single blood sample participant intensive pharmacokinetic study , one , order able investigate association genetic polymorphism drug disposition gene ( encode cytochrome P450 isoenzymes transmembrane transporter ) drug exposure . A candidate gene approach utilised examine locus interest . This procedure provide potentially important information genetic influence plasma drug concentration give insight improve management HIV-infected patient individualise therapy . These study power genetic association enable u build data base genotype-phenotype association . Prospective genetic study would need plan base preliminary data .</detailed_description>
