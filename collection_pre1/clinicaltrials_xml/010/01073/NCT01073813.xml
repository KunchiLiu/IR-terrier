	<brief_summary>The primary aim open-label pilot trial estimate treatment effect 100 mg oral minocycline twice daily 90 day , initiate within 30 day onset ON , functional structural optic nerve recovery compare treatment . The primary outcome measure use measure optic nerve recovery retinal nerve fibre layer ( RNFL ) thickness . Other objective : Secondary outcome temporal RNFL thickness , macular volume , visual outcome .</brief_summary>
