	<detailed_description>We recently complete double-blind placebo-controlled human laboratory study demonstrate treatment low dose acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) inhibitor rivastigmine reduce methamphetamine ( METH ) -induced craving ( see Preliminary Studies , Fig . 2 ) . This finding consistent preclinical report indicate AChE inhibitor donepezil reduce METH-seeking behavior rat follow exposure non-contingent dose METH ( Hiranita et al . 2006 ) . To extend clinical finding , propose 3-year human laboratory study evaluate effect higher dos rivastigmine METH-induced crave self-administration METH . Our recently complete work indicate 3mg rivastigmine attenuate METH-induced crave laboratory . Given high dosage produce great inhibition nicotinic acetylcholine ( ACh ) receptor ( treatment Alzheimer 's disease ) , reasonable predict 6mg 12mg pronounced effect crave measure reinforcement . This human laboratory study critical next step evaluation rivastigmine potential treatment METH dependence . We propose include participant exhibit METH-induced crave screen potential participant prior admission ( criterion base upon Preliminary Studies , Fig . 5 ) . Selection participant demonstrate METH-induced crave facilitate assessment effect rivastigmine crave . The project follow objective : Primary Objective : To characterize effect treatment rivastigmine ( 0 , 3 , 6 mg ) craving produce experimental administration METH ( 0 , 15 30mg , IV ) . Secondary Objective : To characterize effect treatment rivastigmine ( 0 , 3 , 6 mg ) choice METH exhibit self-administration paradigm ( 0 5mg , IV ) .</detailed_description>
