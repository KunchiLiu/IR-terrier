	<brief_summary>The median Orthopaedic surgery wait time Canada 36.7 week ( Esmail 2008 ) , thus need find alternative treatment pathology lumbar disc herniation ( LDH ) . The literature demonstrate selective nerve root injection ( SNRI ) able alleviate sciatic symptom cause LDH ( Riew 2006 ) may beneficial alternative surgery . It necessary determine whether SNRIs provide significant symptom resolution alleviate need surgery , determine success transient delay time surgery . The purpose propose study evaluate success SNRI patient suffer LDH determine factor influence outcome . Over span 2 year , data 100 patient collect . These patient surgical candidate exhaust non-operative measure prior receive SNRI . Upon first assessment , eligible patient randomly assign treatment ( steroid ) control ( saline ) group . The patient treat physician blind treatment give . Each patient follow course treatment information pertain pain symptom record use standard questionnaire . Patient demographic , diagnosis , Worker 's Compensation status , spinal level treatment/outcome , time referral treatment also evaluate . The primary outcome measure define avoidance surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient Selection : All patient ( age 18-65 year ) diagnose low extremity radiculopathy ( sciatica ) secondary lumbar disc herniation refer SNRI principal investigator ( Dr. Neil Manson ) ask participate study . All patient exhaust non-operative measure . Initial Assessment : During initial office visit , patient assess principle investigator inclusion study . If patient demonstrate interest propose research provide Consent Form give opportunity ask Research Assistant question regard participation . . Injections : Standard procedures SNRI use participate Radiologists Department Radiology Saint John Regional Hospital . Each patient randomly assign Research Assistant either treatment ( Kenalog/Sensorcaine ) control ( Saline ) group . All treatment blind treat physician patient . Injectates : Control Group : Saline Treatment Group : Kenalog 40cc/0.25 % Sensorcaine Follow assessment : During follow-up visit , patient re-assessed determine success injection . SNRI success determine self-reported pain symptom reduction . If patient principle investigator deem injection successful , treatment option discuss ( second injection , surgery , etc ) follow-up evaluation schedule .</detailed_description>
