	<detailed_description>During pregnancy mother fulfill tremendous physiological need support immune status well baby . Accordingly , appear highly valuable provide mother nutritional supplement pregnancy lactation promote immune development newborn , thus reinforce infant ' defense . In respect , appropriate maternal diet must provide sufficient energy nutrient meet mother 's usual requirement promote health status , well need grow fetus beyond neonate . Key organogenesis step take place fetal life many functional feature immune system already cod genetic asset individual . However , birth immune system remain fairly immature . An epigenetic , postnatal instruction seem extremely important maturation immune system allow full functionality . The cross-talk mother baby , indeed , crucial optimal development foetus subsequently full functional maturation neonate . The newborn relies protection almost exclusively innate immune system initially instruct educate early life factor derive mother well post-natal environmental factor early life colonization micro-organisms activates innate immunity enhance Th1-cell polarization thereby potentially reduce atopic dermatitis respect hygiene hypothesis . A large part immune education provide factor transmit mother pre-natally placenta post-natally via breast milk . Breast milk contain number nutrient bioactive component , include immune cell , maternal antibody ( mainly secretory IgA ) , cytokine , growth factor , lactoferrin , nucleotide , triacylglycerols , fatty acid , oligosaccharide , vitamin . All together , component beneficially impact health status newborn , confer , among function , immune education early protection . A typical example transfer immune competence TGF-β could transmit active either placenta absorbed neonate milk . This TGF-β important IgA switch factor likely responsible , part , capacity breast-fed infant produce high level mucosal SIgA compare non-breast fed infant . Moreover , milk soluble CD14 transmit newborn contributes prime neonatal gut modulate microbial recognition establishment endogenous microbiota . Diarrhea episodes major manifestation common infant infection viral bacterial aetiology key health concern paediatrics . As mentioned evidence probiotic strain significantly improve diarrheal outcome infant , particularly rotavirus diarrhea . In respect diarrhea occurrence select primary outcome present trial .</detailed_description>
