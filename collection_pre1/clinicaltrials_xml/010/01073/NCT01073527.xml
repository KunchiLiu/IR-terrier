	<brief_summary>To investigate efficacy add Inhaled Hypertonic Saline treatment ( HS ) 1-6 year old child `` asthmatic '' attack present Emergency Department ( ED ) . Background : In 1-6 year old child , common cause acute exacerbation asthma require urgent medical care viral respiratory infection . Most child atopic often respond well bronchodilator steroid . Thus novel treatment need . HS consider effective safe treatment infant acute viral bronchiolitis ( Cochrane 2008 ) . HS act airways several mechanism : HS re-hydrates secretion improve mucus rheology , reduce edema airway wall absorb water mucosa submucosa , cause sputum induction cough , help clear sputum bronchus , stimulate cilial beat via release prostaglandin E2 , break ionic bond within mucus gel , thereby lower viscosity elasticity mucus secretion . It estimate HS respond element may play role viral induce wheeze . The mentioned theoretical benefit provide rationale possible treatment viral induce acute wheezing ( `` asthma '' ) attack nebulized HS young pre-school child present Pediatric Emergency Unit acute ( mostly viral induce ) wheeze . Therefore , purpose present study 1 .

	<detailed_description>A randomized double blind , control , ( DBCR ) trial . To investigate efficacy add inhaled Hypertonic Saline ( HS ) treatment 1-6 year old child asthmatic attack present ED Background : Children age 5 year high hospitalization rate asthma . The common cause acute exacerbation asthma require urgent medical care viral respiratory infection . Most child &lt; 6 year old atopic . These investigator previously demonstrate wheezy infant acute viral bronchiolitis nebulized hypertonic saline produce clinical significant reduction length hospital stay improve clinical score consider effective safe treatment infant acute viral bronchiolitis ( Cochrane 2008 ) . Hypertonic saline solution act airways several mechanism : It Stimulates ciliar beat via release prostaglandin E2 increase mucociliary clearance . It Breaks ionic bond within mucus gel , thereby reduce degree cross link entanglement lower viscosity elasticity mucus secretion . HS induce osmotic flow water mucus layer , re-hydrating secretion improve mucus rheology . HS reduce edema airway wall absorb water mucosa submucosa . HS cause sputum induction cough , help clear sputum outside bronchus thus improve airway obstruction . It estimate many hypertonic saline respond element may play role viral induce wheezing : mucosal submucosal edema , peribronchial infiltrate inflammatory cell , necrosis desquamation ciliated epithelial cell , excess mucus secretion . The combination airway wall swelling , slough necrotic debris , increase mucus production impair secretion clearance , eventually contribute addition bronchospasm airway obstruction , gas trapping , atelectasis impair gas exchange . Moreover , postulate `` status asthmatic '' , relative contribution `` non-spasmodic '' pathological pathophysiological consequence viral asthmatic inflammation airway obstruction , gas trapping , atelectasis impair gas exchange become even important child already treat maximum dilatation dose bronchodilating drug emergency department . The mentioned theoretical benefit provide rationale possible treatment viral induce acute wheezing ( `` asthma '' ) attack nebulized hypertonic saline solution young pre-school child present Pediatric Emergency Unit acute ( mostly viral induce ) wheeze . Therefore , purpose present study investigate addition frequently nebulized 5 % HS/albuterol combination standard therapy acute asthmatic episode present ED preschool child prospective , randomize , double-blind , control fashion .</detailed_description>
