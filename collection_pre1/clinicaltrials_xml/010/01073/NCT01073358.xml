	<brief_title>Resection Colorectal Liver Metastases With Without Routine Hilar Lymphadenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine lymphadenectomy patient undergoing hepatic resection colorectal liver metastasis may improve outcome patient due presence micrometastases show prognostic relevance . While previous study highlight clinical significance perihepatic lymph node metastasis , outcome patient without hilar lymphadenectomy yet compare thus clear conclusion clinical value routine hilar lymphadenectomy CRC patient undergo resection liver metastases draw present data . As disease recurrence occur frequently may affect 75 % patient , strategy require improve postoperative outcome . Routine hilar lymphadenectomy may offer effective approach remove residual disease reduce disease recurrence little additional morbidity . For reason aim present prospective randomize trial evaluate , routine lymphadenectomy reduces recurrent disease patient undergoing resection colorectal liver metastasis .</detailed_description>
