Through vascular smooth muscle relaxation coronary skeletal muscle artery , well via independent mechanism , nitric oxide also implicate improvement exercise capacity . In addition , NO may involve immune system , assist memory function sleep regulation , act cellular signaling messenger . Youthful , healthy athletic individual generally healthier NO system , compare sedentary , unhealthy age individual . NiteworksTM dietary supplement include L-arginine , amino acid act nitric oxide donor show increase level molecule body . NiteworksTM formulate composite mixture along supplement , include antioxidant , may act synergistically L-arginine enhance exercise capacity .</detailed_description>
