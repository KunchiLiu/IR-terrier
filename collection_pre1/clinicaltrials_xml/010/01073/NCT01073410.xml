	<brief_summary>The purpose study find role two specific gene family ( chitinase gene family TGFB family ) . We hypothesize chitinases TGFb pathway gene differentially express airways non-asthmatic subject subject asthma . We hypothesize genetic variant CHIT1 , AMCase , TGFb pathway gene show association asthma related phenotype change expression and/or function protein gene airway several way , include transcript number full length gene splice variant , chitinase gene , level chitinase activity airway secretion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study patient asthma healthy control analyze expression function CHIT1 , AMCase , TGFb pathway gene asthmatic airway affected genetic variation gene . We propose detailed phenotyping asthmatic subject healthy control , include collection induce sputum , exhale air detailed physiologic measure include measure airflow , lung volume , methacholine responsiveness well collection airway cell tissue bronchoscopy . We determine relative expression CHIT1 AMCase specific lung compartment ( large airway , small airway , epithelial cell , macrophage ) effect genetic variant CHIT1 AMCase expression splice variant level chitinase activity airway . These human sample also allow u determine multiple TGFb pathway gene analyze show differential expression lung asthma .</detailed_description>
