	<brief_title>Study Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy ( TSEBT ) Stage IB-IIIA Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Radiation : During total skin electron beam therapy , radiation give entire surface skin . This may cause cancer cell die . Researchers would like learn level effectiveness lower dose radiation therapy likely few side effect standard , high dose . Screening Period : Signing consent form mean able take part study . You follow `` screen test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . Within 6 week radiation therapy begin : - If doctor think need , compute tomography ( CT ) scan type scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check cancer lymph node . Within 4 week radiation therapy begin : - Your medical history record , include drug take take . - You physical exam , include skin exam measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status ) . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Women able become pregnant must negative urine pregnancy test . The study doctor discus screen test result . If screening test show eligible take part study , enrol . Other treatment option discuss . Wash-Out Period : If agree take part study , day first study radiation treatment , stop certain treatment mycosis fungoides . This call `` wash-out period '' . The number week different depend treatment may receive . The study doctor explain type treatment schedule stop . - For 2 week radiation , stop use cancer drug `` topical '' ( apply onto skin ) . - For 4 week radiation , stop radiation therapy , phototherapy ( cancer treatment light ) , cancer drug `` systemic '' ( affect whole body ) , investigational therapy . Study Visit Before Radiation Therapy : Within 1 week first radiation treatment , follow test procedure perform : -You physical exam , include skin exam measurement weight vital sign . Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take . - The doctor draw skin marker mark area body unexposed . This help plan radiation treatment . Depending body shape , 8-16 body area mark . - Photos take whole body . These photo use help doctor find much skin affect disease . Radiation Treatments : If find eligible take part study , receive low-dose radiation skin 4-5 day week 3 week . On Mondays Tuesdays , receive radiation cover entire skin area . You stand treatment . This wider-field radiation treatment give enough radiation unexposed area body , arm , breast female , belly , private area , sole foot . For reason , addition wider-field radiation , also receive radiation cover small area body Wednesdays Thursdays . The amount radiation small body area receive design amount rest skin receive . If study doctor think need standard care , also receive radiation treatment tumor . In case , Fridays . It 4-7 treatment , depend tumor size . At Weeks 2 3 radiation treatment , ask side effect occur . Length Study : You may receive 3 week low-dose radiation therapy . You take study treatment early intolerable side effect occur disease get bad . The follow-up period study last 12 month last treatment . Follow-Up End-of-Study Visits : After last dose low-dose radiation therapy , follow-up visit 1 3 week treatment , every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month total 12 month . However , disease get bad 12-month follow-up period , follow-up visit stop . When off-study , end-of-study visit occur . If stop radiation early due intolerable side effect , follow-up visit twice week doctor think side effect get good . After , return end-of-study visit . At follow-up visit end-of-study visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include skin exam measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect may occur . - Photos take whole body check status disease . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test This investigational study . For type cancer , dose radiation study lower standard . The type radiation therapy ( total skin electron beam therapy ) standard . At time , low dose use research . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
