	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate pathophysiological mechanism underlie formation posthepatectomy ascites focus significance change portal venous hemodynamics hepatic resection . By evaluation factor may involve formation ascites study may help show extent increase portal venous pressure contribute ascites formation . Detailed knowledge pathogenetic factor concern formation postoperative ascites might help prevent protracted hospital stay inconvenience patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mechanism underlie development large-volume ascites hepatectomy remain poorly understood . While study animal model suggest increase portal venous pressure hepatectomy may turn favor transudation fluid peritoneal cavity factor may critically involve postoperative formation ascites . These factor may include drop serum protein level ( colloid osmotic pressure ) , transient impairment renal function surgery-induced capillary leakage . However , good knowledge pathophysiology represent prerequisite efficient treatment . In present study impact change hepatic hemodynamics hepatectomy development ascites investigate . Enrolled patient receive measurement portal venous flow pressure well hepatic artery flow hepatic resection . Associations change parameter development postoperative ascites postoperative complication evaluate .</detailed_description>
