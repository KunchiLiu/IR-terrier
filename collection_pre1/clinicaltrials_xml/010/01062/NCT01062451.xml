	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine dose dependent effect treatment perindopril methamphetamine ( MA ) -induced crave reinforce effect MA index MA self-administration . We also determine effect treatment candesartan MA-induced crave reinforce effect MA index MA self-administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An ACE Inhibitor ( Perindopril ) Angiotensin Receptor Blocker ( Candesartan ) Treatment Methamphetamine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our preliminary data indicate ACE inhibitor perindopril attenuate MA-induced drug craving , suggest perindopril evaluate treatment MA dependence . Candesartan work similarly perindopril lack U-shaped dose response . Like perindopril , candesartan use hypertension . Whereas perindopril reduces synthesis angiotensin II , candesartan block angiotensin II receptor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be Englishspeaking nontreatmentseeking volunteer . Be 1855 year age . Meet DSMIV TR criterion MA dependence . Have selfreported history use MA IV route . Have vital sign follow : resting pulse 50 90 bpm , blood pressure 85150mm Hg systolic 4590mm Hg diastolic . Have breathalyzer test indicate undetectable blood alcohol level upon admission . Have hematology chemistry laboratory test within normal ( +/ 10 % ) limit follow exception : ) liver function test ( total bilirubin , ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase ) &lt; 3 x upper limit normal , b ) kidney function test ( creatinine BUN ) &lt; 2 x upper limit normal . Have baseline ECG demonstrate normal sinus rhythm , normal conduction , clinically significant arrhythmia . Have medical history brief physical examination demonstrate clinically significant contraindication study participation , judgment admit physician principal investigator . Adult ADHD allowable , long symptom interfere participation . Demonstrate MAinduced craving , evidence change `` desire '' great 20 0 100mm VAS . Weigh 60 100kg . Have previous medically adverse reaction MA , include loss consciousness , chest pain , epileptic seizure . Have neurological psychiatric disorder , : episode major depression within past 2 year assess MINI ; lifetime history schizophrenia , psychotic illness , bipolar illness assess MINI ; current organic brain disease dementia assess clinical interview ; history current psychiatric disorder would require ongoing treatment would make study compliance difficult ; history suicide attempt within past three month and/or current suicidal ideation/plan ; history psychosis occur absence current MA use . Meet DSMIV criterion abuse dependence alcohol drug , except nicotine marijuana . Have evidence clinically significant heart disease hypertension , determine PI . Have evidence untreated unstable medical illness include : neuroendocrine , autoimmune , renal , hepatic , active infectious disease . Have HIV currently symptomatic , diagnosis AIDS , receive antiretroviral medication . Be pregnant nursing . Other female must either unable conceive ( i.e. , surgically sterilize , sterile , postmenopausal ) use reliable form contraception ( e.g. , abstinence , birth control pill , intrauterine device , condom , spermicide ) . All female must provide negative pregnancy urine test study entry , weekly throughout study . Have history asthma , chronic cough wheezing , chronic respiratory illness . Currently use alpha beta agonist , theophylline , sympathomimetics . Have illness , condition , use medication , opinion P.I . and/or admit physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion study . Rationale Other Participants asthma take medication asthma exclude due potential adverse interaction treatment medication MA . Participants use alcohol heavily exclude due potential withdrawal symptom hospital . Participants active HIV disease exclude avoid potentially exacerbate underlie illness potential drug interaction . Reliable method birth require prevent pregnancy , use frequent urine pregnancy test exclude woman become pregnant . This important perindopril produce significant birth defect . Criteria Discontinuation Following Initiation : Participants discharge positive breath test indicating use alcohol urine test indicating use illicit use drug study , comply study procedure , tolerate MA .</criteria>
