	<brief_title>Altrazeal™ Versus Aquacel® Ag Partial Thickness Skin Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , randomize , therapeutic exploratory study monitor wound heal new AltrazealTM flexible hydrogel nanoparticle dress compare exist treatment standard ( Aquacel ® AG sodium carboxymethylcellulose dress ) patient least two skin graft donor site . 40 patient least 2 skin graft donor site , range age 3 85 year , enrol . Children ( age 3 16 inclusive ) include patient population possible , exceed 50 % patient enrol . Researchers first identify skin donor site ( A B ) patient take baseline digital image measurement immediately follow surgery ( Day 1 ) . Trained personnel apply dressing provide Sponsor label A B Sponsor random fashion . Typical meticulous wound care adequate analgesic medical coverage provide duration study . Both patient medical staff train instruction use dress . The patient monitor daily part standard procedure in-patient setting . If patient move out-patient setting , continue monitor least every-other-day study center . On day ( in-patient ) every-other-day ( outpatient ) , physician determine whether skin graft donor site heal per standard care guideline ( i.e . &gt; 95 % re-epithelization ) , pain adverse event monitor . The last study visit Day 24 day wound assess `` heal '' , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
