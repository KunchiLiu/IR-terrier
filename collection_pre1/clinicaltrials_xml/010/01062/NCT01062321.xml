	<detailed_description>The study include pregnant woman acute viral hepatitis fulminant hepatic failure ( jaundice ) . The woman FHF recruit medical ward antenatal ward patient routinely admit hospital . The pregnant woman acute viral hepatitis recruit either antenatal clinic medical outpatient , medical antenatal ward pregnant woman AVH admit serum bilirubin level &gt; 15- 20 mg / dl , persistently high bilirubin level 2-3 week , abnormal prothrombin time , evidence progression disease , need parenteral therapy ( excessive vomiting ) . The enrolled subject evaluate basis pre-designed pre-tested proforma respect history clinical examination , obstetrics examination ultrasonography . Ten ml venous blood sample drawn patient time enrollment detection hepatotropic virus ( Various serological marker hepatitis do include : IgM anti-HAV , HBsAg , IgM anti-HBc , HBeAg , anti-HCV Ab IgM anti-HEV would do use commercially available ELISA kit Extraction HEV-RNA serum do ) &amp; level cytokine ( IL-6 , TGF-beta , IFN-g TNF-Î± ) . All subject followed- till delivery . The promoter region cytokine gene amplify PCR appropriate reaction condition use suitable set primer . PCR product use study polymorphisms restriction fragment length polymorphism . The control group would comprise age POG match healthy asymptomatic pregnant woman Follow All participant follow till delivery obstetrical complication , medical complication pregnancy outcome .</detailed_description>
