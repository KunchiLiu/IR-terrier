	<brief_title>The Effects Doxazosin Cardiovascular Subjective Effects Cocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : The primary objective determine safety treatment doxazosin cocaine-dependent volunteer examine hemodynamic subjective effect administration ascend dos cocaine ( 0 , 20mg , 40mg ) placebo dose treatment doxazosin . Secondary Objectives : To evaluate effect doxazosin pharmacokinetics intravenously administer cocaine ; To determine effect treatment doxazosin , compare placebo , subjective effect produce administration cocaine placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be Englishspeaking volunteer seek treatment time study . Be 1855 year age . Meet DSMIV TR criterion cocaine dependence ; participant may may meet criterion nicotine dependence . Nicotine dependence allow require cocaine user smoke cigarette . Have selfreported history use cocaine smoke IV route . Have vital sign follow : supine blood pressure &gt; 100/65 mm Hg , seat blood pressure &gt; 90/60 mm Hg &lt; 150/90 mm Hg , orthostatic change &lt; 20 mm Hg systolic &lt; 10 mm Hg diastolic stand . Resting pulse must &lt; 90 bpm . Have hematology chemistry laboratory test within normal ( +/ 10 % ) limit follow exception : ) liver function test ( total bilirubin , ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase ) &lt; 3 x upper limit normal , b ) kidney function test ( creatinine BUN ) within normal limit . Have baseline EKG demonstrate clinically normal sinus rhythm , clinically normal conduction , clinically significant arrhythmia . Have medical history brief physical examination demonstrate clinically significant contraindication study participation , judgment admit physician principal investigator . Meet DSMIV TR criterion dependence drug cocaine nicotine . Have history evidence suggestive seizure disorder brain injury . Have previous medically adverse reaction cocaine , include loss consciousness , chest pain , epileptic seizure . Have neurological psychiatric disorder , : psychosis , bipolar illness major depression assess MINI ; organic brain disease dementia assess clinical interview ; history psychiatric disorder would require ongoing treatment would make study compliance difficult ; history suicide attempt within past year and/or current suicidal ideation/plan . Have evidence clinically significant heart disease hypertension , determine PI . Have evidence untreated unstable medical illness include : neuroendocrine , autoimmune , renal , hepatic , active infectious disease . Have symptomatic HIV take antiretroviral medication . Be pregnant nursing . Other female must either unable conceive ( i.e. , surgically sterilize , sterile , postmenopausal ) use reliable form contraception ( e.g. , abstinence , birth control pill , intrauterine device , condom , spermicide ) . All female must provide negative pregnancy urine test study entry , upon hospital admission , end study participation . Have asthma currently use theophylline sympathomimetics . Have illness , condition , use psychotropic medication , opinion PI and/or admit physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion study . Criteria Discontinuation Following Initiation : Participants discharge positive breath test indicating use alcohol urine test indicate illicit use drug MEDVAMC , comply study procedure , tolerate study drug . Subject Selection Criteria Rationale Route Administration : Participants require used cocaine IV smoke route avoid expose participant drug route administration produce intensive interoceptive effect usually use participant . Prior experience smoke cocaine allow ( rather restrict population experience IV cocaine ) smoke cocaine reach brain site action rapidly intravenously administer cocaine smoke cocaine produce effect comparable IV cocaine . Speed administration ( rate delivery brain ) stimulant drug likely impact subjective cardiovascular effect , smoke intravenously administer cocaine produce similar subjective effect .</criteria>
