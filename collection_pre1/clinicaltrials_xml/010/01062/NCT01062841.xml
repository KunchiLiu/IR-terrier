	<brief_summary>This interventional study aim reduce multi-drug resistance infection nurse home ( NH ) resident . Each year , stagger 1.5-2.0 million infection occur NHs . Many infection cause multiple drug resistant organism ( MDROs ) include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , vancomycin-resistant enterococci ( VRE ) , multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacillus ( R-GNB ) . Antimicrobial resistance among common bacteria adversely affect clinical course exponentially increase healthcare cost . Recognizing need action , legislator , policy maker , consumer group advocate pathogen-based universal preemptive screening MDROs , particularly MRSA hospital NHs . However , implement sweeping mandate controversial , costly , reactive , base empirical evidence . It result 10-20-fold increase number NH resident place isolation precaution potential reduce attention healthcare worker , isolation functional decline . The investigator proposal evaluate novel focused approach 'do nothing ' 'search destroy ' strategy target subgroup NH resident indwell device high risk acquire MDROs infection . The investigator hypothesize investigator target infection control program ( TIP ) reduce MDRO colonization infection NH resident indwell device . This cluster randomize trial involve 12 NHs ; 6 randomize TIP arm 6 routine care arm . The investigator TIP intervention include four component .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Component 1 : Institute enhance barrier precaution NH resident indwell device ; active screening MDROs ( monthly ) use culture collect multiple body sit identify asymptomatic MDRO carriage resident ; dissemination result clinical staff administration . Component 2 : Structured , active surveillance infection use standardized definition resident indwell device dissemination result clinical staff administration . Component 3 : A hand hygiene promotion program . Component 4 : A structured educational program pertaining indwell device care healthcare worker .</detailed_description>
