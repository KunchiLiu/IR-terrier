	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Stroke second lead cause death major cause disability worldwide . Two-thirds stroke death worldwide occur develop country . According recent report India incidence 30-day case fatality rate higher developed country . In rural urban India rise non-communicable disease like stroke coronary artery disease . In develop country average age stroke 15 year less developed country . It estimate 2021 , stroke relate `` disability adjust life year '' ( DALY ) would become 61 million , 52 million would develop nation . According recent study 55-70 % stroke survivor become fully independent one year 7-16 % remain completely disabled . Prominent residual spasticity occur 46 % patient . Shoulder Injuries Stroke The commonly see disability stroke patient shoulder injury common sub-acute phase stroke . Pain affect shoulder often refer hemiplegic shoulder pain , common complication . The type shoulder injury include glenohumeral subluxation , spasticity shoulder muscle , soft-tissue trauma , rotator cuff tear , shoulder-hand syndrome reflex sympathetic dystrophy . Shoulder injuries negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes good shoulder function pre-requisite successful transfer , maintain balance , perform activity daily live effective hand function . Biomechanics shoulder injury stroke patient A stroke patient upper limb weakness tend place arm resting position promote shorten shoulder adductor internal rotators , elbow , wrist hand flexor . This habitual posturing upper limb result adaptive change muscle tissue impede passive active joint movement.As motor power return , pattern recovery may imbalanced , individual muscle develop strength different rate may increase tone certain muscle group . Imbalanced motor return persistent attempt move increase activation one muscle group pull scapula humerus abnormal posture . When posture maintain , rest length surround muscle may either shorten lengthen , thereby disrupt normal biomechanics joint . In addition flaccid stage , scapula assumes depress downward rotate position , paretic serratus anterior upper part trapezius muscle long support scapula . The combination flaccid supportive musculature downward rotate scapula predisposes head humerus undergo inferior subluxation relative glenoid fossa . Treatment option shoulder injury stroke patient The ideal management hemiplegic shoulder pain prevent happen first place . Various strategy employ prophylaxis hemiplegic shoulder pain . For prophylaxis effective , must begin immediately stroke . Early passive shoulder range motion , support protect involve shoulder early flaccid stage , local treatment heat cold therapy , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation , functional electrical stimulation , range motion exercise , EMG biofeedback regard important step reduce development shoulder pain . Careful position handle limb think prevent hemiplegic shoulder pain , range opinion correct limb position best achieve . Careful position shoulder serf minimize subluxation later contractures well possibly promote recovery , poor positioning may adversely affect symmetry , balance body image . Through correct positioning , development shoulder pain prevent . However , effectiveness method prevent shoulder injury yet establish . Taping widely use field rehabilitation mean treatment prevention sport relate injuries.The essential function tape provide support movement . Taping treatment method use conjunction therapeutic technique treatment various musculoskeletal neuromuscular deficit . It help support inhibit muscle function , support joint structure , reduce soft tissue inflammation , reduce pain . It also produce feedback muscle maintain preferred postural alignment . Various tap material use rehabilitation ( Kinesio tape , Leukotape , Cover-roll stretch tape ) . Scarce information available regarding use shoulder tap prevent shoulder injury stroke patient . Peters Lee , 2003 study single stroke patient sub-acute phase stroke . The patient report decrease pain , improvement activity daily live range motion shoulder . However controlled study use large number stroke patient . Moreover effectiveness tap conjunction therapeutic activity facilitate improvement restore functional use upper extremity acute phase stroke study . Shoulder tap may prove economically sensible prevent shoulder subluxation would decrease number therapy treatment session . Taping material locally available could affordable solution prevent shoulder injury follow stroke . Study goal , objectives main research question : To find effectiveness shoulder tap technique conventional treatment versus sham tap conventional treatment prevention shoulder injury patient acute stroke . Methods Setting : Stroke Unit , Department Neurology , College Physiotherapy , Christian Medical College Hospital , Ludhiana Study design : Prospective , randomize , outcome blind trial ( PROBE design ) . Sample size sample technique : A target sample size 160 choose provide 90 % power ( alpha=0•.05 ) 25 % drop-out detect minimum reduction VAS 38 intervention group base assumption mean reduction VAS score 27 ( SD 18 ) control group . The sample size 160 also 90 % power ( alpha=0•.05 ) 25 % drop-out detect minimum 20 reduction SPADI score intervention group base assumption mean reduction SPADI score 12 ( SD12 ) control group . All consecutive stroke patient give consent randomise blind fashion two treatment group use lottery method . . Patient group The randomization do office personnel unaware clinical detail patient Group 1 : patient give conventional treatment i.e . positioning , handle technique , passive range motion exercise tap affected shoulder Group 2 : patient give conventional treatment alone include sham tap affected shoulder Study definition Stroke define per WHO : Syndrome rapidly develop symptom sign focal , time global , loss cerebral function last 24 hour lead death , apparent cause vascular origin . All stroke patient within first 48 hour onset symptom approach inclusion Instruments/tools Pain : Visual Analog Scale Range motion : full circle universal Goniometer Activities daily living : Shoulder Pain Disability Index Stroke severity : National Institute Health Stroke Scale34 Taping : Plastic micropore elastic adhesive tape ( Leucoplast ) Brunnstrom stage stroke recovery Glasgow coma scale Techniques/ method Treatments 1 . Positioning technique 2 . Handling technique 3 . Range motion exercise 4 . Taping technique Primary Outcome 1 . VAS 2 . SPADI Secondary outcome : ROM Data management analysis plan : Data entry operator enter patient data . Statistical Analyses do use SPSS software version 16 . Summary statistic include frequency , mean standard deviation variable interest generate . Comparison mean continuous variable two treatment group do use Student-t test , binary variable use Chi-square test . The mean outcome measure ( score visual analog scale , range movement shoulder shoulder pain disability index ) admission compare value day 14 day 30 use Student-t test two group . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Implications study result patient safety practice and/or intervention This study use locally available tape plastic micropore elastic adhesive tape tap shoulder . They easily available . The result study wide application tap technique find effective , particularly develop country resource sparse . This simple technique prevent stroke disability due shoulder injury help rehabilitation stroke victim .</detailed_description>
