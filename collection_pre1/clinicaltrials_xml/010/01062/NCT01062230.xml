	<brief_summary>The primary aim trial determine effect short course ( i.e. , 3 cycle ) low-dose Bortezomib ( Velcade ) bone remodel disease progression . The dose bortezomib use trial 0.7 mg/m2 low dose show efficacy 3 large monotherapy trial bortezomib . 17 % patient APEX , 9 % patient CREST 24 % SUMMIT trial treat 0.7 mg/m2 dosage . Bortezomib give day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 42 day reduce incidence possible drug relate side effect . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective The primary objective study : - To evaluate effect Velcade 0.7 mg/m2 dose induce osteoblast activation measure ALP bone marker patient relapsed/refractory myeloma . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective study : - To evaluate association osteoblastic activation myeloma response Velcade . - To identify predictive factor Velcade-associated osteoblastic activation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) account approximately 1 % malignancy 10 % hematological tumor , represent second frequently occur hematological malignancy United States . At one time , 50,000 people suffer MM , approximately 15,000 diagnosed year . The median age approximately 65 year , although occasionally MM occur second decade life . Myeloma disease neoplastic plasma cell synthesize abnormal amount immunoglobulin immunoglobulin fragment . Myeloma hematological malignancy associate bone disease . Myeloma B-cell neoplasia characterize clonal expansion plasma cell bone marrow . It malignant stage plasma cell dyscrasia , also include precursor stage MGUS indolent smolder myeloma . Myeloma frequently associate lytic bone disease responsible debilitate manifestation disease , include bone pain fracture . Bone disease myeloma result activation osteoclast suppression osteoblast activity myelomatous bone marrow . Change bone turnover rate , express increase osteoblastic osteoclastic activity , precede progression pf MGUS smolder myeloma overt myeloma long three year . Treatment bisphosphonates reduce bone resorption also degree , bone formation , long-term moderately increase bone density . Other approve antiresorptive therapy show reduce risk fracture osteoporotic woman , none show restore normal bone mass strength . As result , treatment directly stimulate bone formation may overcome limitation , increase bone mass , improve quality life myeloma patient . Bone disease responsible severe complication associate multiple myeloma . As treatment survival myeloma patient improve , new therapy improve complication important vitally need VELCADE™ ( bortezomib ) Injection small molecule proteasome inhibitor develop Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , ( Millennium ) novel agent treat human malignancy . VELCADE currently approve United States Food Drug Administration ( US FDA ) register Europe treatment multiple myeloma patient receive least one prior therapy . The clinical response bortezomib observe 63-year-old woman multiple myeloma parallel increase alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) lead u group evaluate correlation bone anabolism myeloma response bortezomib . After similar elevation note patient respond bortezomib , thalidomide , dexamethasone combination , ALP level analyse two large bortezomib trial ( Roodman , 2008 ) . Giuliani coworkers ( 2007 ) find bortezomib significantly increase activity critical osteoblast transcription factor , RUNX2 , human osteoblast precursor stimulate bone nodule formation vitro . Importantly , find significant increase number osteoblast per mm2 bone tissue number RUNX2 positive osteoblastic cell marrow biopsy myeloma patient respond bortezomib . Again , effect osteoblast see patient whose myeloma respond bortezomib , make difficult distinguish increase osteoblast activity due anti-myeloma effect bortezomib direct effect osteoblasts . Terpos colleague ( 2006 ) report bortezomib also decrease DKK1 RANKL concentration normalize bone remodel index serum patient relapse myeloma . However , majority patient show increase bone formation marker also show antitumor response bortezomib , make unclear stimulatory effect bone formation secondary effect bortezomib myeloma due direct effect osteoblast differentiation After similar elevation note patient respond bortezomib , thalidomide , dexamethasone combination , ALP level analyse two large bortezomib trial . We first complete retrospective analysis large Phase 3 trial compare ALP level responder ( ≥PR ) v nonresponders ( ≤PR ) patient . Data obtain APEX Crest Summit protocol , show total 85 myeloma patient treat bortezomib dose 0.7 mg/m2 different reason significant antimyeloma efficacy multiple cycle . This dose ( 0.7 mg/m2 ) use trial test antimyeloma activity bortezomib still associate bone anabolic effect . Data APEX , summit , CREST trial file Millennium Pharmaceuticals . Given study continuation previous protocol ( UARK 2004-22 ) dose 1.3 1.0 mg/m2 antimyeloma effect associate bone formation observe . This trial test effect 0.7 mg/m2 ( show effective antimyeloma treatment ) bone formation determine minimal dose associate bone effect .</detailed_description>
