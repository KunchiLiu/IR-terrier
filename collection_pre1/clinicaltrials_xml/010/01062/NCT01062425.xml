	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study temozolomide , radiation therapy , cediranib maleate see well work compare temozolomide , radiation therapy , placebo treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma ( type brain tumor ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether temozolomide radiation therapy effective give without cediranib maleate treat glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Radiation Therapy With Without Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition cediranib ( cediranib maleate ) chemoradiation treatment enhance treatment efficacy measure 6-month progression-free survival rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition cediranib chemoradiation treatment enhance treatment efficacy measure overall survival . II . To determine addition cediranib chemoradiation treatment enhance treatment efficacy measure progression-free survival . III . To determine association tumor O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase ( MGMT ) gene methylation status treatment response outcome . IV . To compare record toxicity cediranib + chemoradiation arm versus chemoradiation arm . V. To evaluate whether 6-month progression-free survival associate overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 3 day . Patients undergo radiation therapy ( intensity-modulated radiation therapy 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ) QD , 5 day week , 6 week receive temozolomide PO QD cediranib maleate PO QD 6 week . Patients receive temozolomide PO QD alone day 1-5 . Treatment temozolomide repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 3 day . Patients undergo radiation therapy ( intensity-modulated radiation therapy 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ) QD , 5 day week , 6 week receive temozolomide PO QD placebo PO QD 6 week . Patients receive temozolomide PO QD alone day 1-5 . Treatment temozolomide repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
