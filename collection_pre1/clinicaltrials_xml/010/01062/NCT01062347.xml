	<brief_summary>Zinc deficiency widespread public health problem develop country . The true prevalence condition remain uncertain lack specific , sensitive reliable biomarker assessment human zinc status . The widely use indicator measure zinc status serum zinc level , , however , homeostatically regulate influenced stress infection . To explore possibility use mRNA level zinc responsive gene indicator zinc status , Cao Cousins suggest metallothionein ( MT ) mRNA level monocyte peripheral blood mononuclear cell indicator recent zinc uptake . However , usefulness MT mRNA also limit level influenced metal , copper , cadmium cobalt also affect stress . Several author propose expression zinc transporter gene might useful marker Zn status . Evidence show reduction dietary zinc content produce marked increase intestinal absorption decrease intestinal zinc loss . As zinc homeostasis regulate intestine , study zinc transporter organ may provide indication recent zinc uptake . Recently , study begin investigate applicability use white blood cell zinc transporter expression indicator zinc status find transporter zinc responsive . The primary objective study explore whether expression zinc responsive gene , zinc transporter human intestinal mucosal cell , use indicator zinc status . The specific aim compare gene expression : ) intestinal mucosal cell obtain duodenal biopsy , b ) slough intestinal mucosal cell isolated feces , c ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) fast individual receive usual diet + placebo usual diet + supplemental zinc ( 20 mg/d 7 day ) . Gene expression value intestinal mucosal cell ( biopsy ) compare placebo zinc supplement group . Similar comparison do cell isolated stool PBMCs . This study also provide opportunity compare relative responsiveness gene expression serum zinc concentration follow supplementation explore kinetics change serum zinc concentration . Thus , blood sample obtain measure serum zinc concentration two occasion prior intervention specify interval intervention .</brief_summary>
