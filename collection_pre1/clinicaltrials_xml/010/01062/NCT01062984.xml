	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury often treat use continuous renal replacement therapy . Two commonly use treatment continuous venvenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) continuous venovenous hemodialysis ( CVVHD ) . CVVH use convective clearance remove toxin solutes patient circulation , CVVHD rely diffusive clearance remove toxins/solutes . This study evaluate two method effective clearing body waste/solutes . We hypothesize renal replacement therapy either modality ( hemodialysis hemofiltration ; CVVHD CVVH , respectively ) use modern membrane high blood flow rate associate similar clearance small middle molecular weight solute . We believe continuous renal replacement therapy use CVVHD associate decreased clotting event longer hemofilter survival , well improve resource utilization ( i.e . nursing time , alarm , etc . ) .</brief_summary>
