	<brief_title>Effect Erythritol Xylitol Dental Caries Prevention Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Several polyols ( xylitol , sorbitol , erythritol ) show act excellent sugar substitute , especially in-between meal food product . Most commonly use chewing gum , recent field trial also show clear effectiveness xylitol lozenges . Although sorbitol metabolize slow rate sucrose microorganism , ferment slow rate mutans streptococci include S. mutans xylitol erythritol consider non-acidogenic . It demonstrate study xylitol reduces great extent caries rate sorbitol , however , scientific committee medicinal product opinion clear data support concept xylitol possess specific effect vivo validate superiority claim polyols . Objective : It believe benefit sugar-free gum may twofold ; 1 ) decrease lactic acid production increase salivary flow potentially lead increase buffering acid plaque 2 ) increase supersaturation saliva mineral ion well enhance clearance sugar mouth . Thus sugar substitution salivary stimulation could , argue , equally responsible noncariogenicity sugar-free chewing gum . By compare long term effect several polyols , possible remineralization effect incipient caries lesion prevent new caries lesion comparison sorbitol , study help demonstrate superiority erythritol eventually xylitol sorbitol help demonstrate role sugar substitute , beyond saliva stimulation-mediated oral benefit dental caries prevention.Sorbitol lozenge use positive control . The saliva plaque sample analysis would reveal possible mechanism expect caries preventive effect . Study design : This double-blind , parallel , randomize , control study primary school child around Tartu city . The allocation child three group base classroom practical reason . The classroom randomly allocate intervention control group . The study last three year . During first 2 year , two intervention group consume either xylitol erythritol-containing lozenge control group provide sorbitol-containing tablet Then , two option , depend effect caries prevention 2 year feed polyols depend SD caries incidence , . If SD &gt; 2 , group spill power study would high enough see statistical effect . In case , third experimental year , group stop eat polyol-containing lozenge tablet assess last preventive effect polyol . If SD &lt; 2 , group spill two sub-groups , one sub-group stop eat polyols-containing lozenge ass last effect polyol caries prevention sub-group continue consume polyol-containing lozenge ass long-term effect polyol intake caries prevention . Study population : The classroom 1st 2nd primary schoolchildren ( n=450 ) randomly allocate two intervention group ( erythritol xylitol ) one positive control group ( sorbitol . The list 1st 2nd grader classroom use sample frame . The allocation classroom base random number generate computer . Intervention : The test product distribute pupil ( erythritol , xylitol , sorbitol ) group three time day school day ( 200/year ) teacher . Main study parameters/endpoints : All child clinically examine begin trial , one - , two - three year baseline examination . All surface mixed dentition ( primary permanent teeth ) examine . The mean annual incipient dentinal caries increment calculate . The teeth ( FT ) surface ( FS ) restore extracted caries study period calculate included caries experience index ( dmft/DMFT ) . The plaque saliva sample collect examination . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : There clinical examination plaque sample collection study subject four time study . Each examination take 15 min . No risk pupils expect examination . The child give toothbrush toothpaste every 6 month . After study examination , pupil drive museum bus .</detailed_description>
