	<brief_summary>Reducing drug side effect key issue transplantation . One class drug commonly use , calcineurin inhibitor ( CNIs ) , associate negative side effect , namely , toxicity transplant kidney . In patient , toxicity think associate loss transplant function transplant many year . The introduction new immunosuppression medication however , provide opportunity minimize avoid CNIs , may reduce occurrence toxicity kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcineurin Inhibitor Sparing After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It clear minimize use CNIs may beneficial kidney transplant recipient . The purpose study determine whether minimization CNI drug improve patient survival rate long-term kidney function . If subject agree participate research project , randomly assign one two different immunosuppression drug combination . All drug use study standard FDA Approved immunosuppressive drug currently use transplant patient . It unclear however , combination provide well long-term outcome . If six month study subject experienced rejection episode exclude participate second phase study , ask whether would like continue study . If decide participate Phase II , another randomization one two different immunosuppression drug combination . This involve either assign group CNI dose lower group CNI drug stop replace non-CNI drug call Sirolimus . Phase II begin 6 month post-transplant second consent obtain participate Phase II .</detailed_description>
