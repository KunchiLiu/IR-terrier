	<brief_title>Altrazeal Range Motion Study Comparing With Typical Carboxymethyl</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , randomize , single blind therapeutic exploratory study monitor range motion wound treat new nanoparticle hydrogel dress compare range motion wound treat exist treatment standard ( sodium carboxymethylcellulose dress ) patient partial thickness burn . A total 50 joint study . The patient least 7 year age.. The Department Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Parkland Hospital Health System , UT Southwestern , ask enroll enough patient meet proposed 50 joint study site ( approximately 3-5 afflicted joint per patient ) . Children include patient population possible . Inclusion criterion medical condition least one partial thickness burn cross least one peripheral joint axial proximal interphalangeal joint . As control , patient also need unburned contralateral joint without major internal external joint derangement . The Primary Investigator first identify study site control site patient take initial measurement . Trained personnel apply bandage study site . No secondary bandage apply . Typical meticulous wound care adequate analgesic medical coverage provide duration study . Both patient medical staff train patient use instruction dress . The patient monitor short time application bandage part standard procedure , patient allow go home instruction care . Within 2-8 day application , dress inspected range motion measure study site control site . Any concomitant treatment ( medication , wound care ) thoroughly document duration study . Both dressing design remain wound bandage fall , indicate re-epithelialization wound . The dressing remove patient medical staff unless sign infection , deterioration bandage , adverse event . If bandage fall , patient instruct immediately call medical staff .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient least 2 year age ; 2 . Patient general good health ; 3 . Patient partial thickness burn cross least one peripheral joint axial proximal interphalangeal joint ; 4 . Patient one unburned contralateral joint without major internal external joint derangement use control 5 . Patient willing able cooperate protocol 30 day 6 . Patient capable provide informed consent 7 . Patient provide authorization use disclosure protect health information 1 . Age le 2 year ; 2 . Patient superficial full thickness burn wound ; 3 . Patient acutely infect wound ; 4 . Patient wound surround cellulite ; 5 . Patient history hypersensitivity component either nanoparticle sodium hydrocellulose dressing , know sensitivity hydrogel bandage treatment 6 . Patient concurrent clinical condition , judgment Investigator cold either pose health risk patient participate study , could potentially influence outcome study ; 7 . Patient wear type orthopedic device may come contact dressing ; 8 . Patient history poor wound healing , history smoking , history drug/alcohol abuse , skin/immune system condition would increase likelihood wound irritation , infection increase chance early termination 9 . Patient wound originate chronic condition 10 . Patients history immunodeficiency syndrome condition 11 . Patients apply dress medication ( OTC prescription ) wound ( within 48 hour study ? ) 12 . Patient participate clinical research study within last 30 day prior enrollment ; 13 . Patient unable communicate cooperate investigator due language problem , poor mental development , impaired cerebral function</criteria>
