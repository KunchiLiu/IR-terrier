	<brief_summary>When age , lose muscle . It exactly clear happens , know muscle loss increase health risk lead health problem . Lifting weight ( i.e . perform resistance exercise ) proper nutrition , particular eat enough high quality protein , help slow loss muscle mass potentially even reverse . Protein resistance exercise think stimulate muscle make protein and/or potentially slow rate body breaks protein . Whey protein high quality protein isolated milk know stimulate new protein synthesis proteins body . However , date , effect whey protein muscle protein synthesis , particularly elderly yet determine . Thus purpose study : 1 ) determine whey effective source protein stimulate muscle protein synthesis elderly , similar previously see young person ; 2 ) determine small amount whey protein consume maximally stimulate muscle make new protein ; 3 ) see perform resistance exercise augment increase new muscle protein synthesis whey consumption ; 4 ) try find whey effective soy protein stimulate new muscle protein synthesis suppress muscle protein breakdown elderly , similar previously see young person</brief_summary>
