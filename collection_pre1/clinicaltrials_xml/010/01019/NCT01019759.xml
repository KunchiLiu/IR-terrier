	<brief_title>The Value add-on Arrhythmia Surgery Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) connect increased morbidity mortality . In addition , quality life diminish due palpitation , dyspnea , dizziness syncope . AF frequently associate valvular coronary disease . In AF patient undergo valvular coronary surgery arrhythmia almost always relapse . For symptom control anti-arrhythmic drug cardioversion use breakthrough arrhythmias side effect drug happen frequently . For effective symptom control `` add-on '' arrhythmia surgery advocate . However , present know whether add-on arrhythmia surgery indeed affect morbidity quality life . In respect benefit chronic sinus rhythm outweigh risk prolonged operation . In addition , cardiovascular complaint unrelated AF may persist even successful operation , thus offset benefit chronic sinus rhythm . Add-on surgery costly standard surgery may compare favourably short hospital admission due less frequent post-operative AF . Valvular heart disease frequently associate ventricular remodelling : decrease ventricular function atrial dilatation . AF may worsen heart failure due tachycardiomyopathy . Elimination AF might therefore enhance recovery structural functional remodelling promote recovery quality life operation . The PIAF , RACE AFFIRM show chronic sinus rhythm necessarily associate reduced morbidity enhance quality life . PIAF however show exercise tolerance well rhythm control achieve . Further analysis RACE AFFIRM pending . One drawback study fact chronic sinus rhythm difficult obtain . In PIAF , RACE AFFIRM 30 50 % sinus rhythm end follow-up . By contrast , arrhythmia surgery highly effective treatment respect . Forty patient underwent ( phase 1-study ) coronary bypass- valve surgery add-on arrhythmia surgery way protocol propose . This mean epicardial beat heart without use heart-lung machine . In last follow-up 80 % patient longer atrial fibrillation . With similar treatment procedure , invasive , arrested heart endo cardially , success percentage report vary 60 % till 80 % . This large variance success rate probably related primary course disease degree morphological abnormality . In spite meaningful result `` add-on '' arrhythmia surgery general accept treatment . The intended patient population remain generally untreated . Historical data patient university hospital Maastricht show add treatment success rate 25 % patient sinus rhythm . Considering randomised comparison add-on arrhythmia surgery standard surgery warrant .</detailed_description>
