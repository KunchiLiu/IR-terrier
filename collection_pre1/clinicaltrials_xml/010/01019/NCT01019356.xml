	<brief_title>Role Insulin Action Free Fatty Acids Hyperandrogenism Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common complex endocrine disorder affect 6 10 % childbearing age woman . To diagnose PCOS , woman must display two three symptom : clinical biochemical hyperandrogenism , oligoamenorrhea , and/or echographycally confirm polycystic ovary . Many study also demonstrate PCOS woman insulin resistant control woman match body mass index ( BMI ) . Thus , insulin resistance ( IR ) secondary hyperinsulinemia would important premise development PCOS . In fact , prevalence type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) triple PCOS woman . Higher free fatty acid ( FFA ) concentration also observe circulation PCOS woman . As FFA accumulate liver muscle instead fat cell , could important cause IR accord theory lipotoxicity . Some indirect evidence suggest FFA accumulation androgen secrete cell ( ovary adrenal gland ) could enhance androgen production . Based finding , hypothesis FFA accumulation non fatty tissue would lead IR hyperandrogenism PCOS woman . Accordingly , Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma ( PPARγ ) agonist ( rosiglitazone ) would great therapeutic option PCOS activation induces transcription factor gene implicate fatty acid metabolism . The aim verify insulin-related hyperandrogenism reverse PCOS woman follow 8-week treatment rosiglitazone compare simple insulin reduction acarbose . For purpose study , 14 lean woman ( BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2 ) 36 obese woman ( BMI 30-39 kg/m2 ) PCOS well 14 lean 14 obese control woman recruit determine insulin sensibility ( insulin level , M-value , metabolic clearance rate glucose ) FFA metabolism ( FFA level , rythm apparition disapearance FFA ) 75g oral glucose tolerance test 2-step insulin-glucose clamp .</detailed_description>
