	<detailed_description>The safety use atomoxetine MA user characterize measure cardiovascular effect MA determine occurrence adverse reaction treatment atomoxetine placebo . We evaluate atomoxetine ( 0 40 mg , BID ) MA dose ( 0 30 mg , IV ) . Participants randomize atomoxetine match placebo 6 day . Study drug administer daily 40 mg/day first two study day , twice daily day 3-5 , &amp; day 6 . After discharge first component , least 2-week washout period , participant re-admitted UCLA GCRC switch opposite study medication additional 6 day . Methamphetamine/saline administer non-contingently component I day 13 , component II day 7 , 1 min use syringe pump activate study physician nurse practitioner order ass safety tolerability atomoxetine . During drug administration session , heart rate blood pressure monitor frequently . A code team respond require . Vital sign must remain within value specify Stopping Criteria initiation MA administration . The physician nurse practitioner administer MA/placebo available in-house pager least 4 h infusion . In addition , heart rate blood pressure assess three time daily throughout inpatient portion protocol .</detailed_description>
