	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate three diagnostic method assess small bowel disease patient suspect known Crohn 's disease . All patient examine ileo-colonoscopy , capsule endoscopy , MRI CT small bowel within 14 day . However , capsule endoscopy perform patient stenosis detect ileo-colonoscopy , MRI and/or CT. All investigation describe similar pre-defined standardized fashion radiologist physician responsible describe finding MRI , CT capsule endoscopy blind finding ileo-colonoscopy . The physician charge treatment receives randomise result either MRI , CT capsule endoscopy . Thereafter patient follow 12 month evaluate difference clinical outcome depend randomize result . In combination diagnostic validity inter-observer agreement MRI , CT capsule endoscopy seek establish optimal diagnostic strategy two patient category .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERALL AIM OF THE STUDY To evaluate three diagnostic method assessment intestinal disease patient suspect newly diagnose Crohn 's disease patient know Crohn 's disease . PARTICIPATING CENTRES - Department Medical Gastroenterology , Odense University Hospital , DK-5000 Odense C - Department Internal Medicine , section Gastroenterology , Vejle Hospital , DK-7100 Vejle - Department Internal Medicine , section Gastroenterology , Sydvestjysk Hospital , DK-6700 Esbjerg - Department Internal Medicine , section Gastroenterology , Svendborg Hospital , DK-5700 Svendborg - Department Radiology , Vejle Hospital , DK-7100 Vejle PROTOCOL A A comparative study capsule endoscopy , magnetic resonance image computer tomography scan small bowel patient suspect newly diagnose Crohn 's disease Protocol procedures : At inclusion patient standardise work-up include medical history , physical examination , blood faeces sample ileo-colonoscopy . Within two week MRI CT scan small intestine ( day randomise order ) subsequently CE perform patient . All investigation describe similar pre-defined standardized fashion radiologist physician responsible describe finding MRI , CT CE blind finding ileo-colonoscopy small bowel examination . In follow-up part study physician charge patient randomise receive result either MRI , CT CE . Anticipated outcome : The study perform improve evidence best primary investigation assessment small intestinal involvement patient suspect Crohn 's disease , evaluate combination diagnostic modality may improve assessment disease burden individual patient , study whether initial diagnostic modality affect handle patient study interobserver variation MRI CT scan . PROTOCOL B A comparative study magnetic resonance imaging , computer tomography scan capsule endoscopy patient know Crohn 's disease Protocol procedures : At inclusion patient undergo standardise work-up include history , physical examination , blood faeces sample ileo-colonoscopy . Within two week MRI , CT scan small intestine ( day randomise order ) capsule endoscopy perform patient . Capsule endoscopy perform patient small bowel stenosis confirm ileo-colonoscopy , MRI and/or CT. All three investigation describe similar predefined standardized fashion radiologist blind finding ileo-colonoscopy . In randomised part study physician charge patient randomise receive result either MRI , CT og capsule endoscopy . Anticipated outcome : The best diagnostic method evaluation small intestinal involvement patient know Crohn 's disease may different patient suspect Crohn 's disease . Thus current study hope provide evidence whether MRI , CT scan capsule endoscopy best diagnostic approach .</detailed_description>
