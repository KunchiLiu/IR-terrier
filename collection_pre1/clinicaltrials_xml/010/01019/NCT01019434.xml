	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective give together temsirolimus temozolomide treat patient glioblastoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give radiation therapy together temsirolimus see well work compare give radiation therapy together temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Temsirolimus Temozolomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Document activity profile temsirolimus evaluation overall survival 1 year patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme , without methylation MGMT gene promoter , treat temsirolimus concomitantly radiotherapy , follow temsirolimus maintenance therapy . Secondary - Investigate safety tolerability therapy regimen patient . - Assess progression-free survival overall survival patient . - Assess biomarkers tumor tissue relevant temsirolimus disease state , correlation clinical outcome patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord institution , age year ( &lt; 50 v ≥ 50 ) , Karnofsky performance status ( PS ) ( &lt; 80 % v ≥ 80 % ) OR ECOG PS ( 0 1 v 2 ) , corticosteroid use ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Within 7 week surgery open biopsy , patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week receive oral temozolomide concurrently daily 6 week . Beginning 4 week completion concurrent chemoradiotherapy , patient receive adjuvant oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment adjuvant temozolomide repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Within 7 week surgery open biopsy , patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week . Patients also receive temsirolimus IV 30-60 minute weekly begin 7 day initiation radiotherapy . After completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive maintenance temsirolimus IV weekly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Frozen tumor biopsy paraffin-embedded tumor material obtain surgery open biopsy blood sample collect analysis molecular marker , determination methylation status MGMT gene promoter ( randomization later time ) , study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
