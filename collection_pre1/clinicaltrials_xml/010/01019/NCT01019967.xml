	<brief_summary>Background : - Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) common childhood disorder often respond standard treatment . Researchers explore role brain chemical call glutamate play symptoms OCD , test drug call riluzole reduces glutamate see changing level glutamate brain help treat disorder . - Researchers interested use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , type magnetic imaging , take picture various chemical brain . MRS image use detect change brain level glutamate child take riluzole . Objectives : - To use magnetic resonance spectroscopy study level glutamate brain child adolescent take riluzole . Eligibility : - Children adolescent age 7 17 enrolled current NIMH riluzole trial protocol ( 05-M-0225 ) , able lie still scanner hour time , willing three MRS scan . Design : - Researchers study children/adolescents begin take study medication riluzole placebo child MRS scan start study medication . The scan take hour . - About 2 week reach full dose study medication , participant second hour-long MRS scan . Participants third MRS scan study medication 12 week . - Some child already complete 12 week riluzole placebo , take riluzole , one MRS scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Examination Children Adolescents Taking Riluzole Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective This study use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure neurotransmitter glutamate anterior cingulate cortex ( , tolerate , leave caudate nucleus possibly thalamus ) child adolescent . Study Population All subject participant ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled trial ( 05-M-0225 ) glutamate antagonist , drug riluzole , Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) . The subject male female child adolescent , age 7-17 year . They meet criterion clinically significant OCD fail benefit standard-of-care treatment unable tolerate treatment . Some subject also diagnosis autism spectrum . Design In one group sixteen young people , glutamate measure anterior cingulate cortex three point time : - baseline , start riluzole placebo ; - within ten fourteen day baseline evaluation , reach full dose study drug ( active drug placebo ) sixteen subject randomize ; - end twelve week double-blind phase study . In second group sixteen young people , subject open-label phase study , glutamate measure ( first ) anterior cingulate cortex single point time subject achieve steady state open-label drug riluzole . If subject tolerate additional time scanner , glutamate also measure left caudate possibly leave thalamus . Glutamate level group correlate change OCD measure . Outcome Measures - In first group , change glutamate activity anterior cingulate associate active drug ( riluzole ) administration , compare change glutamate activity subject take placebo . - In second group , correlation serum riluzole level , glutamate activity ( flux ) anterior cingulate ( possibly caudate thalamus ) , therapeutic effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects may include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Male female subject , 7 17 year age . 2 . Female subject childbearing potential must use medically accept mean contraception must remain abstinent . 3 . Each legal guardian must level understanding sufficient agree require test examination . Each legal guardian must understand nature study . Each legal guardian must consent study protocol . 4 . Subjects must fulfill DSMIV criterion ( OCD ) CYBOCS score great 20 . In doubleblind phase , subject enrol combined OCD ASD cohort must also meet DSMIV criterion Pervasive Developmental Disorder well OCD . 5 . Each subject already take medicine must take usually effective dos medicine demonstrate effective childhood OCD , must stable dose least six week , must newly recognize intolerable adverse effect medicine . Subjects currently take medication must adequate trial past least one medicine show effective symptom childhood OCD , must fail see improvement must intolerable adverse effect medicine . 6 . Subjects must able swallow capsule . 7 . Subject protocol enrol riluzole childhood OCD protocol ( NIH 05M0225 ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude study follow reason : 1 . Presence psychotic symptom lifetime history schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , psychotic disorder , serious unstable psychiatric illness . Medicially unstable due binging , purging , starvation . 2 . Judged clinically risk suicide ( suicidal ideation , severe depression , factor ) . Diagnosis DSMIV Major Depressive Disorder necessarily exclusion criterion . 3 . Disabling Tic Disorder require contraindicate medicine . 4 . Female subject pregnant , nursing , unwilling use effective contraception . 5 . Serious unstable illness , include gastroenterologic , respiratory , cardiovascular ( include ischemic heart disease ) , endocrinologic , neurologic , immunologic , hematologic disease . 6 . Renal hepatic dysfunction would interfere excretion metabolism riluzole evidence increase upper limit normal BUN/creatinine , twofold elevation upper limit normal serum transaminase ( ALT/SGPT , AST/SGOT ) , gamma glutamate ( GGT ) , bilirubin . 7 . Documented history hypersensitivity intolerance riluzole . 8 . DSMIV Substance Abuse Disorder within past 90 day Substance Dependence Disorder within past 5 year , use tobacco . 9 . Taking contraindicated drug . 10 . Unable swallow capsule . 11 . In addition , patient receive cognitivebehavior therapy period study .</criteria>
