	<brief_summary>Sunitinib show anti-tumor activity variety human non-small cell lung tumor ex vivo model . Many Phases II III clinical trial sunitinib several solid tumor complete still ongoing . So far , efficacy sunitinb confirm phase III trial imatinib-resistance intolerance advance gastrointestinal stromal tumor patient . And sutent approve effective two phase II trial advance renal cell carcinoma patient failure immunotherapy , one phase III trial treatment-naive advanced renal carcinoma patient . Sunitinib ( SUTENT ® ) approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advance renal carcinoma patient gastrointestinal stromal tumor patient intolerant progress imatinib mesylate . European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) conditionally grant marketing approval treatment metastatic renal carcinoma patient failure immunotherapy . A phase II trial ( A6181040 study ) non-small cell lung cancer patient treat sunitinib alone show anti-tumor activity . In 63 enrolled patient treat 4/2 schedule ( 4 week treatment , two week interruption ) , 7 patient confirm partial response ( overall response rate , 11 % ) , median progress-free time 14.3 week . Presently , phase III study underway non-small cell lung cancer patient follow recruit . Non-small cell lung cancer cell often over-express vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor . Besides , expression VEGF ligands also correlate increased tumor angiogenesis , well shorten survival time . One study treat VEGF-directed monoclonal antibody ( bevacizumab ) VEGFR platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) small molecule inhibitor ( sunitinib ) show non-small cell lung cancer patient anti-tumor activity . The chemotherapy drug , docetaxel platinum-based compound , evidence direct cytotoxicity cancer cell . Therefore , investigator pay attention efficacy combine sunitinib conventional chemotherapy study . The study design first line salvage therapy metastatic unresectable non-small cell lung cancer patient . The main goal study evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) duration response ( DR ) sunitinib combinational docetaxel cisplatin chemotherapy-naive advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salvage Therapy With Sunitinib , Docetaxel Platinum Metastatic Unresectable Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This single-center , open-label , phase II clinical trial . Simon two-stage analysis adopted.The sample size first stage 16 patient . The length study approximately 24 month . The targeted subject patient metastatic unresectable non-small cell lung cancer . Study Endpoints Primary Endpoint Assess response rate sunitinib , docetaxel cisplatin treatment naïve chemotherapy metastatic unresectable non-small cell lung cancer patient . Secondary Endpoint 1 . Time disease progression ( defined time period start investigated medication investigator assess disease progression ) end study . 2 . Duration survival ( defined time period start investigated medication death ) . 3 . Safety profile sunitinib combination docetaxel cisplatin : cardiac toxicity assess accordance National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( version 3.0 ) . The incidence serious adverse event related treatment incidence specific adverse event ( serious non-serious ) gastro-intestinal perforation , wound heal complication , bleeding , hypertension , arterial thromboembolic event proteinuria investigate . NCI-CTCAE criterion ( version 3.0 ) use .</detailed_description>
