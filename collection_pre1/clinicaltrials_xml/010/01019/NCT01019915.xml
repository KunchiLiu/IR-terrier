	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) common hospital discharge diagnosis elderly patient . Fatigue dyspnea exercise intolerance poor quality life main characteristic syndrome , associate substantial mortality morbidity , . Although systolic dysfunction recognize primum movens CHF , generally accept progression syndrome solely related pump failure . The neuro-endocrine model reach wide consensus one basic mechanisms progressive heart failure base good result obtain ACE-inhibitor therapy . A decade ago cytokine model add explain syndrome heart failure . The cytokine highly potent endogenous peptide produce different cell type . Elevated level might marker cardiac cachexia , may also play important role mechanism CHF progression . Subsequently , muscle hypothesis propose explanation deconditioning CHF patient . In skeletal muscle healthy individual balance distribution type I fibres ( aerobic ) , type IIA fibre ( aerobic anaerobic ) type IIB fibre ( mostly anaerobic ) . In CHF shift type II fibres reduce capillary density well reduce cytochrome oxidase activity observe , mechanism lead shift clarify . Deconditioning may important factor aggravate underlying pathophysiology CHF exercise training show improve exercise performance reduce symptom population . This partly mediate activation Protein PGC-1 , critical factor coordinate activation metabolic gene require substrate utilization mitochondrial biogenesis . The increase enzyme highly correlated increase peak VO2 aerobic interval training program heart failure . One would expect improvement exercise performance follow improvement central hemodynamics cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) would associate improved muscular blood flow energy metabolism . However , far report publish skeletal muscle response CRT . The purpose study evaluate effect 6 month CRT pace skeletal muscle histology mitochondrial mass association change alterations functional capacity measure peak VO2 . Moreover , also seek ass relationship change skeletal muscle alteration inflammatory response serum skeletal muscle .</detailed_description>
