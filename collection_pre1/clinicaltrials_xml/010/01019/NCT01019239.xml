	<detailed_description>Background Current Knowledge : Until recently , natural history diverticular disease poorly understood evidence suggest link recurrent presentation diverticulitis perforation almost forty year old render relevance modern day practice questionable best . More recently , question clarify seem risk perforation follow single ( treat ) episode diverticulitis order 2 % per year risk require emergency Hartmann 's procedure cohort 1 2000 patient year follow-up . As surgical intervention , certain risk profile associate elective resection morbidity estimate 25-50 % ( include stoma formation 10-14 % ) mortality 1-2 % . The current vogue ( despite dissention ) towards conservative approach management non-perforated acute diverticulitis away elective sigmoid colectomy absence perforation . Management perforate diverticulitis continue evolve . The last 50 year see standard care shift three stage procedure ( 1.Drainage defunctioning colostomy , 2.Excision diseased segment , 3.Colostomy reversal restoration continuity ) , Hartmann 's procedure , resection primary anastomosis , treatment antimicrobial therapy alone carefully select ( Hinchey Grade 2 ) population . Since learn curve laparoscopic surgery begin plateau , resection perforate diverticular disease show safe effective conventional open technique . Irish surgeon pioneer institution laparoscopic lavage acute non-faeculant diverticulitis . The operative method describe involves laparoscopy , copious washout , drain placement treatment antimicrobial therapy ( intravenous 72hours follow oral one week ) . Benefits include low mortality , stoma avoidance , minimal wound infection , shorter operative time difference recurrence compare primary resection anastomosis . Having demonstrate clear clinical advantage laparoscopic lavage standard care ( Hartmann 's procedure primary resection anastomosis ) acute non faeculant perforate diverticulitis , feel time ripe formalise finding performance multicentre national randomise control trial- LapLAND ( LAParoscopic Lavage Acute Non-faeculant Diverticulitis ) . Relevance : Perforated diverticulitis require emergency surgery . This carry significant risk mortality high 15 % index admission report . It appear morbidity mortality relate resection complicate uncomplicated disease reduce laparoscopic intervention compare open . The real question , however , whether necessity perform resection whether lavage sufficient . Our group establish safety procedure large cohort date24 prospective multi-institutional study 100 patient . We provide convince evidence laparoscopic lavage reasonable alternative resection non-faeculant perforated diverticulitis . We demonstrate low mortality rate despite patient co-morbidity disease severity . Benefits lavage alone include stoma avoidance decrease wound infection . At 36 month follow appear subsequent resection appear unnecessary . These finding confirm similar French trial publish year demonstrate excess morbidity mortality , reduction hospital stay low rate stoma formation . Having establish safety new intervention ( laparoscopic lavage ) , aim translate well establish study design protocol multi-institutional randomised control trial believe direct comparison way provide convince evidence one modality another . Knowledge transfer/implementation/consolidation : Evidence date regard management perforate diverticulitis base combination eminence base opinion outdated retrospective analysis . A true prospective analysis compare standard care ( Hartmann 's resection anastomosis defunctioning stoma ) 'new therapy ' ( laparoscopic lavage alone ) yet publish . Aims Objective : To compare patient outcome follow standard care ( Hartmann 's resection anastomosis defunctioning stoma ) 'new therapy ' ( laparoscopic lavage alone ) treatment acute perforate non-faeculant diverticulitis Irish hospital . Specific research question include : 1 . Which treatment modality confers least mortality morbidity patient non-faeculant perforated diverticulitis ? 2 . Does treatment influence length hospital stay return activity daily live ? 3 . Do patient undergo laparoscopic lavage alone require emergency sigmoidectomy later date ( within one year period ) ? 4 . Does laparoscopic lavage alone confer advantage term stoma-free survival ? Strategy : An Irish multi-centre trial perform aim compare two treatment modality patient present acutely perforate non-faeculant diverticulitis . Pre-operative detail , intraoperative finding post-operative course prospectively accrue operate surgeon . All patient follow twelve month primary ( operative in-hospital mortality ) secondary ( in-hospital post-discharge morbidity ; rate stoma formation ; rate re-presentation diverticulitis without perforation . ) end-points record . Study Outline : All patient demonstrate clinical sign generalise peritonitis radiological evidence intra-peritoneal free air ( erect chest radiograph abdominal CT scan eligible study . Individual patient consent seek . They give intravenous fluid ( standardised regime ) intravenous antibiotic ( 3rd generation cephalosporin metronidazole ) . All patient give prophylaxis deep vein thrombosis ( compression stocking low molecular weight heparin ) . When patient receive adequate fluid resuscitation proceed theatre emergency basis . Pneumoperitoneum establish via blunt entry umbilical port . Two 5mm port place suprapubic right low quadrant facilitate triangulation instrument manipulation lavage . The peritoneal cavity thoroughly examine stage classify accord Hinchey . All patient faeculant peritonitis undergo Hartmann 's procedure primary resection anastomosis accord local preference exclude study basis . In absence faeculant peritonitis , patient randomise undergo Hartmann 's procedure primary resection anastomosis ( depend standard practice individual unit ) laparoscopic lavage alone . Peritoneal lavage perform four quadrant use least 4 litre warm saline drainage clear . Intravenous antibiotic continue minimum 72hours oral antibiotic continue one week . Oral fluid commence first postoperative day diet introduce subsequently , depend clinical status . Early mobilisation encourage . Study Management : This multicentre surgical clinical trial coordinate R &amp; D unit Colles Institute RCSI . The Colles Institute comprise National Surgical Training Centre , Centre R &amp; D Centre Innovation Surgical Technology . The Project Manager trial Mr Kieran Ryan , 10 year experience run clinical trial along many year experience Irish Health System , include role former GCP inspector Irish Medicines Board . Kieran team ensure trial carry accordance relevant regulation , GCP standard requirement protocol . This ensure smooth run trial integrity research data management patient . There also DSMB ( Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board ) external surgeon establish oversee progress study ensure safety patient forefront trial . Data Collection : Data collection perform operating surgeon designate member surgical team ( present time operation ) record electronic pro-forma electronic Case Report Form . It include patient demographic ( age , sex ) , previous diverticular history American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) grade specific co-morbidities , intervention perform , operation perform , incidence stoma formation , re-intervention index admission ( radiological operative ) in-hospital morbidity ( myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , wound infection , abscess require drainage , urosepsis , renal failure respiratory insufficiency ) , mortality , time return diet , time discharge . Further detail record post-operative visits- stoma-free survival one year , number day alive follow discharge , reinterventions within 12 month , patient satisfaction . Standardisation treatment within trial : Patients may withdraw trial time wish . Re-laparotomy may perform discretion operate surgeon fix indication include clinical deterioration failure improve within 48-72 hour post-operatively . Potential foci concurrent sepsis out-ruled ( respiratory , urinary ) clinical , biochemical radiological investigation . Hospital Inclusion Patient Accrual : All eligible patient ( see exclusion criterion ) present participate hospital perforate diverticulitis recruit trial . They furnish patient information leaflet implication inclusion trial explain operating surgeon . It explain non-willingness participate trial negative impact treatment . If patient willing participate trial , verbal write consent obtain prior transfer operate theatre . Sample size Calculation : Having perform extensive literature review study compare treatment entity perforate non-faeculant diverticulitis , sample size calculation reveal patient cohort 100 arm sufficient detect difference morbidity mortality group ( 25 % versus 10 % ; two side significance 5 % power 80 % ) . A significance level 0.05 two side Likelihood ratio test use significance level achieve design 0.04997 . In order guarantee sufficient sample size , therefore , 300 patient must fulfil study criterion ( allow exclusion 100 time operation ) . Recruitment patient expect difficult evidence date convince least equivalent outcome believe patient would hope assigned lavage group hope avoid stoma . From surgeon 's perspective , laparoscopic lavage technically less challenging time consume traditional treatment modality .</detailed_description>
