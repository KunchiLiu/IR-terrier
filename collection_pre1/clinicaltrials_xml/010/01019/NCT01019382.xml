	<brief_summary>Over 7000 patient diagnosed pancreas cancer every year UK . Only 10 % catch early enough surgery cure . The rest best undergo chemotherapy extend survival , current treatment offer best improvement month compare treatment . In addition quarter patient respond treatment . In addition patient often experience profound weight loss , loss appetite energy primarily cancer process . Our hypothesis addition fish oil infusion gemcitabine chemotherapy result improve rate tumour response CT imaging . Fish oil , specifically omega-3 fatty acid component , appear range powerful anti-cancer action . This support evidence wide range source , laboratory experiment basic human study . Although evidence specifically include many pancreatic cancer study laboratory yet confirm human trial . Contrary conventional chemotherapy , fish oil naturally occur non-toxic compound associate side-effects chemotherapy . In fact number clinical study demonstrate significant improvement quality life pancreas cancer patient treat fish oil , particularly reference improvement appetite energy level . This course addition anti-cancer action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effect Gemcitabine With Fish Oil Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our trial involve recruit patient unresectable pancreatic cancer suitable current standard care gemcitabine chemotherapy . They assess suitability offer entry trial . This essentially consist 4 hour long infusion purify omega-3 fish oil immediately gemcitabine chemotherapy finish . This occur week three week , rest fourth week . The cycle continue cancer show progression CT scan , gemcitabine chemotherapy stop due toxicity patient withdraws dy . CT scan assess perform every 2 month . Blood test take treatment analysed change inflammatory marker . The patient ask fill quality life pain questionnaire week 4 hour infusion .</detailed_description>
