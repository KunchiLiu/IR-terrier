	<brief_title>Cardiac Rehabilitation Heart Event Recovery ( HER )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart disease lead cause morbidity mortality woman Canada . Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) outpatient secondary prevention program compose structured exercise comprehensive education counseling . CR participation result low morbidity mortality , among benefit . Unfortunately , woman significantly less likely adhere program men . While traditional model CR care hospital-based mixed-sex program , woman minority program , state program meet care preference . Two model CR care develop : hospital-based women-only ( sex-specific ) monitor home-based program . Other control pilot test 36 patient , woman 's adherence program model well know . CR4HER 3 parallel arm pragmatic RCT design compare program adherence traditional hospital-based CR male female , home-based CR , women-only hospital-based CR . Power calculation base pilot study suggest sample size 261 patient need detect difference adherence program model use ANCOVA . Participants female CAD , acute coronary syndrome , percutaneous coronary intervention , bypass surgery , valve surgery inpatient recruit 5 hospital . Also , female patient refer participate cardiac rehabilitation ( 3 ) centre one aforementioned diagnosis approach participate . The primary outcome variable program adherence operationalized CR site-reported percentage prescribe session complete phone on-site , report staff member blind study objective . Secondary outcome exercise capacity operationalized VO2peak grade stress test , exercise , dietary , smoke medication adherence behaviour measure hospital 1 week post-CR . By identify CR program model result great adherence woman , optimize participation potentially cardiac outcome .</detailed_description>
