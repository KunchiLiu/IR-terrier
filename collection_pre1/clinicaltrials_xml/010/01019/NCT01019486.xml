	<detailed_description>The CACTI cohort follow progression coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) development clinical CVD participant characterize baseline examination ( 4/00-3/02 ) two follow-up re-examinations 3 6 year later . We propose assess subset population determine vasodilatory reserve relate early coronary atherosclerosis T1D . In CACTI Study seek determine relationship risk factor CAD coronary arterial calcification T1D subject compare age gender match control cohort . The trial identify CAC high risk marker CAD extensive diabetic patient . T1D patient CAC nondiabetic control also appear impaired coronary vasoreactive function . Impaired response acetylcholine test adenosine vasodilation report diabetic subject . The relationship coronary microvascular dysfunction diabetic cardiomyopathy support observation similar microvascular abnormality . Endothelial dysfunction precedes predict clinical macrovascular disease , also independent prognostic marker adverse long-term cardiovascular outcome . Significantly great CAC T1D also note non-DM subject . There also great rate increase note CACTI cohort . Myocardial Flow Reserve MRI : Myocardial perfusion distribution myocardial blood flow reserve simultaneously assess use MRI first-pass Gd contrast injection approach . Rapid MR imaging ( MRI ) first pas injection Gd compound use assess myocardial perfusion spatial resolution 2-3 mm , detect regional impairment myocardial blood flow ( MBF ) may lead ischemia . The myocardial perfusion reserve ( MPR ) useful concept quantify vasodilator response . The perfusion reserve estimate ratio MBFs vasodilation baseline , similar describe labeled microspheres . Assessment myocardial blood flow flow reserve cardiac MR robust technique . There relationship CAC hyperemic flow reserve , although may less strong depend upon methodology employ . However , CAC still marker atherosclerotic process process appear aggressive T1D .

Adenosine infusion gold standard invasive non-invasive assessment myocardial blood flow reserve , yet regadenoson potentially great coronary arterial vasodilation simple bolus injection ideal agent study difference CFR different disease state . Limited data publish utility regadenoson invasive assessment CFR data publish regard utility agent assess hyperemic myocardial blood flow response respect cardiac MRI . Research Design Methods POPULATION CACTI Diabetes Study : We propose recruit subject CACTI cohort sub-study focus individual complete 6-yr follow-up . Imaging Studies Non-DM CAC &gt; 100 T1D CAC &lt; 100 T1D CAC &gt; 100 MPI 5 10 10 CMR 5 10 10 InvCBF 5 5-10 5-10 Subject recruit complete three part protocol myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) ; cardiac MR assessment myocardial blood flow reserve ( MBF ) ; subject significant symptom clinical indication proceed invasive `` Catheterization Laboratory '' assessment CBF reserve ( Invasive CBF ) Aim 1 . Determine relationship myocardial perfusion index , regional CBF invasively measure coronary perfusion reserve The first approach ass difference myocardial perfusion T1D non-DM subject employ vasodilatory stress regadenoson . The myocardial perfusion index describe previously calculate individual . The relative perfusion index directly compare invasively obtain CBF reserve vascular territory assess . Stress Myocardial Perfusion Protocols . Subjects undergo regadenoson stress MPI 400 mcg administer 10 second bolus follow injection 30 mCi Tc-99m-sestamibi . Gated SPECT perfusion image perform within 30 minute . A rest study perform separate day similar sestamibi dose administer . Acquisition Protocol . All SPECT study perform parallel hole collimator gate acquisition protocol ( 10 % RR window ) acquire 16 time bin . Data Processing Gated data set assess mean count , correct dose , decay time imaging , measure segment utilize 4D-MSPECT ( INVIA , Ann Arbor , Michigan ) . MPI define correct stress count divide correct rest count . Statistical Analysis : Based upon prior experience approximately third T1D subject MP index less 1.5 direct compare invasive measure flow reserve . This maybe treated binary variable continuous variable combine T1D subject compare non-DM control subject . Data analyze use unpaired t-test , linear logistic regression . Continuous variable express mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) compare across group use unpaired t-tests . All statistical analysis perform use two-sided test p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Aim 2 . Measure coronary blood flow use Regadenoson stress CMR determine MBF reserve type 1 DM subject compare non-diabetic control . Using method two compartment model K trans function analysis , determine myocardial blood flow reserve cardiac MR . This approach use regadenoson bolus vasodilator hyperemic response coronary arterial bed . We assess relationship MBF reserve lack reserve disease state i.e T1D non-DM subject . In addition regionally compare MBF reserve MP index obtain radionuclide techniques coronary vascular territory . Similarly CAC value obtain 6-yr CACTI follow-up study directly compare blood flow measurement within coronary vascular distribution . CMR Protocol : An IV injection antecubital vein connect power injector perform MR scanner functional perfusion imaging ( Symphony 1.5 T , Siemens Medical ) . All image acquire 4 channel phase array surface coil . Blood flow imaging perform three short-axis simultaneous slice ( basal , mid apical ) acquire initial bolus injection gadolinium ( 0.04 mmol/kg rate 5 ml/sec ) follow 10-ml saline flush administer use power injector . ProHance use due low viscosity contrast agent . The short-axis slice acquire use SSFP image sequence , TR/TE/flip 185ms/1.2ms/50 degree dynamically acquire inserted 330x 380 matrix ) . Images acquire use field view range 280 400 mm . A first perfusion scan perform rest , follow second scan maximal vasodilation 15 min later . Hyperemia initiate administration 400 mcg bolus injection regadenoson acquisition start 1 minute post regadenoson administration . Subjects monitor use MRI compatible blood pressure monitor single lead ECG monitoring . Data analysis Quantitative analysis MR blood flow data perform Leonardo Workstation use Argus perfusion analysis software . Images register manually adjust horizontal vertical registration frame . The left right ventricular blood pool six myocardial region analyze extract linear slope initial signal increase well start peak signal intensity . To extract slope , base , peak signal , line manually fit upslope signal ( typically 4-6 time point ) , base peak position upslope data manually identify . Normalized slope ( SlopeN ) calculate division leave ventricular blood pool slope , net signal gain ( SG ) determine subtract initial peak signal intensity . The myocardial flow reserve index calculate myocardial region ratio normalize hyperemic time-intensity slope normalize baseline time-intensity slope .
