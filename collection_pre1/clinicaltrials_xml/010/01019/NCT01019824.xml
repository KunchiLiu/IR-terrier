	<brief_summary>The aim study determine experimental drug , ralfinamide , relieve neuropathic low back pain , demonstrate superiority placebo , `` dummy '' sugar pill contain active medication . Ralfinamide , give either 160 mg/day 320 mg/day , take divide dose twice-a-day , compare placebo . If randomly ( chance ) select receive placebo , receive medication throughout treatment period study . Data study provide essential information choose dos ralfinamide use treatment type pain potentially type pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ralfinamide Patients With Chronic Neuropathic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ralfinamide show effective analgesic number animal model neuropathic pain . These observed effect ralfinamide may achieve target hyperactivity peripheral sensory neuron , voltage-dependent , Na+-channel blockade [ Stummann et al. , 2005 ] Ca++-channel blockade , sensitization central neuron , NMDA-receptor modulation . Evidence efficacy mixed peripheral neuropathic pain syndrome demonstrate Study 001 [ Anand et al. , 2008 ] . In particular patient neuropathic pain due nerve compression ( e.g. , compression radiculopathy , lumbar spinal stenosis , sciatic nerve compression , spinal root compression , intercostal neuralgia ) show response ralfinamide treatment . In sub-population , statistically significant improvement severity pain , measure VAS 11-point Likert scale , well great proportion patient meet `` responder '' criterion , compare placebo group , note ralfinamide treatment . Similarly , patient study classified neuropathic low back pain also show significant benefit treatment ralfinamide ; therefore , focus current study indication . The current study evaluate safety , tolerability analgesic efficacy ralfinamide patient chronic neuropathic low back pain due nerve compression , i.e. , compression radiculopathy post-traumatic/post-surgical lumbar radiculopathy . It also note current drug therapy global regulatory approval treat type chronic neuropathic low back pain ; therefore , ralfinamide prove effective patient population , would satisfy unmet medical need .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrolment study : 1 . Patient present physical/neurological examination low back pain without radiation lower limb must display topography compatible L1 S1 territory and/or respective sensory motoric impairment . 2 . Patient must chronic neuropathic low back pain minimum intensity `` 40 mm '' ( moderate ) great Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ; 100mm ) screening , average `` 40 mm '' baseline ( base prior 7 day ) . 3 . The onset pain occur least three month , long 3 year , prior screen visit , assess investigator patient 's medical history . 4 . Patient affect current neuropathic pain ( pain provoke lesion peripheral nervous system ) . The diagnosis make neurologist/anaesthesiologist/pain specialist base history , clinical evaluation and/or laboratory finding ( rule systemic cause , e.g. , hypothyroidism , rheumatoid arthritis , nephropathy , diabetes [ MNSI score &gt; 2 ] ) accordance taxonomy diagnostic criterion document International Association Study Pain ( IASP ) Classification Chronic Pain . A neurological disease must directly correlate pain , include pain due spinal root compression . If radiologic data support diagnosis obtain previously document patient 's record . In case radiologic examination available , Investigator consider perform examination , necessary support diagnosis , screen phase . 5 . Patient one follow cause neuropathic low back pain : Noncancer lumbar pain due compression radiculopathy posttraumatic/postsurgical lumbar radiculopathy . 6 . Patient 's low back pain clear neuropathic component , indicate rating Pain Detect Questionnaire ( PDQ ) great 18 . 7 . Patient 1885 year age , inclusive . 8 . Patient willing able understand sign approve Informed Consent Form . 1 . Females pregnant lactating , childbearing potential , defined follow : surgically sterilize less one year ; age ≥ 50 year postmenopausal condition start less 24 month prior screen visit ; age &lt; 50 year postmenopausal condition start less 24 month prior , and/or postmenopausal status confirm determination serum level FSH 17β estradiol ; fecund practice double contraception method ( e.g. , hormonal contraceptive plus barrier method ) . 2 . Patients cause peripheral central neuropathic pain ( include psychogenic nociceptive pain ) , pain due metabolic ( include diabetes ; MNSI score &gt; 2 ) infectious proliferative disease , pain due condition severe neuropathic pain . 3 . Patients history migrate pain former mononeuropathy neuralgias anatomical territory . 4 . Patients severe trophic change , severe swelling , joint deformity stiff joint limited passive movement , patient may candidate back surgery within 52 week baseline . 5 . History current diagnosis positive test Hepatitis B C ( unless vaccinate ) . 6 . Clinically significant , uncontrolled gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , endocrine , pulmonary cardiovascular disease ( include non wellcontrolled hypertension ) , asthma , uncompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , severe uncontrolled diabetes ( HbA1c &gt; 10.0 ) . 7 .
