	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : The Flexitouch lymphedema system may lessen lymphedema cause treatment breast cancer . It yet know whether Flexitouch lymphedema system effective complex decongestive therapy treat lymphedema . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study Flexitouch lymphedema system treat stage II lymphedema patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flexitouch Lymphedema System Treating Stage II Lymphedema Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantitatively assess , circumferential measurement CT image technique , ability Flexitouch Lymphedema System maintain reduction limb volume completion reductive phase complex decongestive therapy population patient upper limb lymphedema secondary effect breast cancer treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine drainage territory lymphatics affect arm chest use CT determine whether pattern change treatment Flexitouch Lymphedema System/daytime garment versus Flexitouch Lymphedema System/daytime garments/nighttime bandage versus standard self-care . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients undergo complex decongestive therapy comprise daily compression garment ( sleeve glove ) use , daily manual lymphatic drainage ( self-administered ) , nighttime bandage low stretch Comprilan bandage . Arm II : Patients undergo daily compression garment ( sleeve glove ) , nighttime bandage low stretch Comprilan bandage , daily Flexitouch treatment 1 hour every evening . Arm III : Patients undergo daily compression garment ( sleeve glove ) daily Flexitouch treatment 1 hour every evening . In arm , treatment continue 3 month .</detailed_description>
