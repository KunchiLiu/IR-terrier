Although cholesterol level know altered psoriasis , study use standard lipid profile measure cholesterol . These test indirectly measure LDL ( bad cholesterol ) become less accurate triglyceride level high , often see individual psoriasis . We design case-control study use specific detailed cholesterol test measure serum lipid level psoriasis patient , allow accurate determination LDL well assessment lipid-contribution cardiovascular risk . We also measure marker inflammation may contribute cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
