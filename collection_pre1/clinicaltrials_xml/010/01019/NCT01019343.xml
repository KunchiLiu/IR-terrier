	<brief_summary>Background : - Previous study give researcher information brain control movement , people learn make fine , skilled movement , people movement disorder . However , research need learn cause movement disorder , Parkinson 's disease . - By use small , specialized study evaluate people movement disorder compare healthy volunteer , researcher hope learn change brain possible cause movement disorder . Objectives : - To good understand brain control movement . - To learn movement disorder . - To train movement disorder specialist . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old movement disorder diagnose neurologist able participate base specific requirement small study . - Healthy volunteer 18 year age old . Design : - Participants screen visit medical history , physical examination , questionnaire determine eligibility . Eligible participant give consent participate seven additional outpatient visit study procedure . The number session procedure need participation depend specific symptom . - Participants must avoid drink alcohol caffeinated drink ( soda , coffee , tea ) least 2 day ( 48 hour ) session . - Potential study may include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , functional MRI scan , electroencephalography , magnetoencephalography , transcranial magnetic stimulation , nerve sensory stimulation , movement mental task procedure . - This study provide treatment movement disorder . Participants stop treatment order participate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The purpose protocol improve understand pathophysiology movement disorder perform small behavioral , electrophysiological neuroimaging sub-studies . This allow identifying dysfunction central nervous system cause behavioral abnormality see movement disorder patient . This also help determine potential diagnostic therapeutic target . Some sub-studies require healthy volunteer . We conduct : - Pilot Sub-study ( previously label Small Pilot Sub-studies ) Pilot sub-studies exploratory nature , order develop enough information generate hypothesis . The criterion transition new full protocol sufficient amount information generate power analysis . There enrollment limitation pilot sub-studies.Small substudies pilot investigation large study , - Hypothesis-Testing Sub-study ( previously label small number sSub-studies ) define study specific hypothesis thattested complete subject healthy volunteer patient , , Hypothesis-testing sub-studies undergo statistical PIRC review 6 subject ( one group ) 12 ( six per arm ) two group study additional subject recruit . Together , P.I . PIRC decide whether continue hypothesis sub-study subject new protocol necessary . A memo request review hypothesis-testing sub-studies possible additional enrollment send PIRC statistical reviewer . If action request accrual increase proceeds beyond PIRC IRB , need submit form amendment prospective review/approval . - Individual patient investigation may increase knowledge disease process helpful patient diagnosis , - Training investigator prior experience use electrophysiological neuroimaging technique , - Technical development new experimental paradigm . This protocol include non-invasive technique minimal risk ( MRI , EEG , MEG , peripheral nerve stimulation , TMS ) . Study population We intend study 600 healthy volunteer 350 patient diagnose movement disorder . Design We design small project idea arise patient population pertinent theme movement disorder pathophysiology . We investigate patient movement disorder healthy volunteer rest state perform simple motor sensory task . If small study lead result interest large population necessary reach statistical significance , separate protocol submit priori hypothesis , specific study design power analysis adapt pilot exploratory sub-studies perform present protocol . Outcome measure MRI : analyze measure amplitude BOLD signal ( fMRI ) ; tractography seed target region interest ( use DTI ) ; morphometry brain region ( use VBM ) ; different neurotransmitter level brain region interest ( use MRS ) . EEG MEG : quantify measure event- task-related potential , synchronization/desynchronization , coherence sensor source locate close brain area interest . TMS : analyze measure MEP amplitude central conduction time . Behavioral measure : quantify measure reaction time initiate movement , EMG pattern , movement kinematics ( position , velocity , acceleration , curvature ) . We may measure autonomic data course experiment ( blood pressure , skin conductance , respiratory rate ) would correlate outcome measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MOVEMENT DISORDER PATIENTS : Patients either welldefined diagnosis diagnostic dilemma , depend upon substudy Age 18 old Able give inform consent Agree drink caffeine alcohol 48 hour certain study session agent modify brain activity may confound outcome measure . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Age 18 older . Able give inform consent . Agree drink caffeine alcohol 48 hour certain study session agent may modify activity brain study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MOVEMENT DISORDER PATIENTS : Have use illegal drug within past 6 month Have 7 alcoholic drink week case woman 14 alcoholic drink week case man . Have brain tumor , stroke , head trauma , epilepsy history seizure . Have psychotic disorder , Bipolar Disorder current depressive episode . Have another neurologic disorder movement disorder Have head injury loss consciousness second . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Have abnormal finding neurological examination perform Have use illegal drug within past 6 month Have 7 alcoholic drink week case woman 14 alcoholic drink week case man Have brain tumor , stroke , head trauma , epilepsy history seizure . Have major depression major mental disorder ( axis I disorder ) Have neurological disorder . Have head injury loss consciousness second . ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MOVEMENT DISORDER PATIENTS AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS SPECIFICALLY FOR fMRI : We follow NMR Center guideline MR safety . Some exclusion : Have nonMRI compatible metal body , cardiac pacemaker , brain stimulator , shrapnel , surgical metal , clip brain blood vessel , cochlear implant , artificial heart valve metal fragment eye make MRI unsafe . Unable lie flat back expect length experiment 3 hour Have uncontrolled movement head Have abnormality brain image neurologic examination relate diagnosis Uncomfortable small space expect length experiment 3 hour Pregnancy ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MOVEMENT DISORDER PATIENTS AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS SPECIFICALLY FOR TMS : Have metal eye skull area , brain stimulator , shrapnel , surgical metal , clip brain , cochlear implant , metal fragment eye , make TMS unsafe . Having cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , implant pump stimulators also exclusion criterion . Have hearing loss .</criteria>
