	<brief_summary>The efficacy immunogenicity enteric vaccine generally find low child develop develop country . This observed vaccine cholera rotavirus , ETEC typhoid vaccine . There number factor may contribute difference vaccine `` take rate '' child , e.g . breast feed nutritional status child might influence immunogenicity efficacy . Thus , breast feed newborn young infant may adversely influence immune response vaccination , might pronounce effect develop developed country . Breastfeeding also show interfere serum immune response rotavirus vaccine although effect could overcome administer three rather one dose oral rotavirus vaccine . Our recent study Dukoral Bangladeshi child age 18 month young show response rate magnitude response improve breast milk temporarily withhold . Thus , administration vaccine may adjust give breast fed child . Another factor may affect immunogenicity effect zinc . Previous study show zinc enhances immune response cholera vaccine participant &gt; 2 year age , recent study also observe similar effect infant . In research project , plan study number different factor might influence immunogenicity two license oral model vaccine , specifically inactivate kill oral cholera vaccine , Dukoral , live oral typhoid vaccine , Ty21a . We also identify strategy might improve immunogenicity vaccine . The main objective study identify immunization regimen may improve immunogenicity vaccine young child , could subsequently field trial Bangladesh develop country . Specifically , determine : ( ) intervention identify enhance immune response Dukoral , include zinc supplementation , could also enhance immune response Ty21a ; ( ii ) two vaccine able induce acute memory B T cell response , ( iii ) treatment antiparasitic drug prior immunization could modulate immune response cholera typhoid vaccine ; ( iv ) examine arsenic exerts suppressive effect immunogenicity vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods Vaccine field sit overall study design : Mirpur . The vaccine study carry field site Mirpur , urban Dhaka , oral cholera , ETEC rotavirus study well amoebiasis study conduct last 15 year . For Dukoral vaccine , two dos give study participant , 14 day apart . In case Vivotif , 3 dos administer alternate day i.e . day 1 , 3 5 two dos 28 day apart . Blood stool sample collect prior vaccination , 7 day intake dose cholera vaccine 7 day intake last dose typhoid vaccine , volume sample immunological assay describe Appendix 2 . The participant allow eat drink one hour one hour intake vaccine . To assess effect zinc immune response typhoid vaccine young child , supplementation initiate 2 week first dose continue 21 day last ( third ) dose typhoid vaccine ( total 40 day ) . Serum zinc concentration determine baseline . Venous blood collect trace element free vacutainers , place ice arrival ICDDR , B laboratory day . Vaccine study arsenic contaminate area Shahrasti : Shahrasti thana population around 200,000 locate 40 kilometer Matlab , well connect Comilla , Chandpur Dhaka road . According BAMWSP ( Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project ) , subsoil water Shahrasti Thana heavily contaminate arsenic ; 99 % tube well report contaminate ( 50 microgram/L ) . BAMWSP DGHS already identify 3000 patient skin lesion consistent arsenic toxicity , represent area second high number arsenic-induced skin lesion Bangladesh . In collaboration ICDDR , B , University Chicago Columbia University jointly conduct large longitudinal surveillance clinical trial patient arsenic induced skin lesion . The aim large study reduce skin cancer evaluate clinical well biochemical marker . We plan study response child sit Dukoral use infrastructure facility ongoing study . The immunogenicity study carry describe earlier . We plan immunize 102 child age 2-5 year two dos Dukoral interval 14 day . Equal number child study area know low level arsenic , Mirpur field site Dhaka city . This first study compare immune response mucosal vaccine arsenic prone arsenic low area . Informed consent selection study subject vaccine study : Voluntary write informed consent obtain parent/guardians participation child include vaccination sample blood stool various assay ( Appendices ) . Healthy child ( 1 - 5 year ) adult ( 18-45 year ) male females live Mirpur field site , currently enrol research study , whether conduct ICDDR , B organization , screen enrol subject meeting eligibility criterion . Similar procedure follow part Dukoral study conduct Shahrasti . We previously experience least 60 % family agree participation child research study . The prospective participant study carefully examine assessed physician enrollment . A detailed history previous immunization obtain , nutritional status recent illness ( outline ) could compromise immune system family background etc . consider study enrollment . The participant free chronic disease recent illness may compromise immune system include arsenic related skin lesion child Shahrasti Dukoral vaccine would evaluate . Children also exclude : ( ) history chronic gastrointestinal disorder ; ( ii ) diarrheal illness past 2 week ( diarrhea define passage 3 abnormally loose watery stool 24 hour period ; ( iii ) febrile illness precede week ; ( iv ) chronic illness ; ( v ) history receive antibiotic treatment within last 7 day ; ( vi ) severe protein energy malnutrition ( PEM ) . The nutritional status child assess use anthropometric measurement ( weight-for-age , weight-for-length/height ) ; child -2SD weight height/length NCHS median enrol . Similarly , child receive zinc past two month also recruit . Baseline laboratory assessment : Stool : Microscopic examination , culture isolation identification enteric pathogen include ETEC . V. cholerae S.Typhi carry four day prior vaccination . Children pathogens isolated stool specimen vaccinate since confound evaluation response vaccine . When immunization second dose vaccine carry ( 14 day first dose ) child fever diarrhea exclude study . For arsenic related study , urine collect stored assessment level arsenic . This carry Biochemistry Nutrition Unit ICDDR , B use standard procedure . Vaccine , administration allocation : Dukoral . The cholera vaccine , Dukoral produce Swedish Bacteriological Laboratories ( SBL Vaccin AB Stockholm , Sweden ) . This inactivated , oral cholera vaccine consist kill bacteria prepare individual strain O1 ElTor classical V. cholerae include LPS protein antigen , also contain recombinant B subunit cholera toxin ( rCTB ) . One dose vaccine contain 1.25 x 1011 kill whole cell plus 1 mg rCTB . Immediately use , individual dos liquid form vaccine mixed reconstitute bicarbonate buffer . For child , vaccine suspend 20 ml ( total 4 teaspoon ) bicarbonate-citric acid buffer [ buffer prepare add 100 ml water sachet bicarbonate buffer ( 2 g bicarbonate ; 750 mg citric acid ; Recip AB , Stockholm ) . For adult , Dukoral reconstitute 100 ml buffer . Vivotif : Live , attenuate oral typhoid vaccine , Vivotif , contain 2-6x109 CFU ( colony-forming unit ) S. Typhi Ty21a strain ( 1,2 ) . The Berna Biotech Ltd , Berne , Switzerland , manufacture vaccine . The enteric-coated , typhoid vaccine package set 3-capsules . The vaccine capsule swallow drinking water administer alternate day i.e . day 1 , 3 5 . For immunization child 5 year age , plan administer vaccine bicarbonate buffer procedure child traveler clinic ( Sweden USA ) . For purpose capsule open content suspend 20 ml bicarbonate buffer take orally . Overall sample size calculation : The sample size estimate different intervention , use one-sided hypothesis 95 % confidence , minimum detectable mean difference ( DMD ) 50 % improvement baseline , adjust around 15 % dropout . In early Dukoral cholera vaccine study Bangladesh , 56 % recipient child age 6 month 2 year respond vibriocidal antibody ; For Vivotif vaccine data vaccine age &gt; 6 year document 67 % seroconversion . The sample size different component study calculate base assumption 50 % child respond Vivotif . Based result obtain zinc supplementation immune response Dukoral , observed increase rate supplementation 56 % 79 % , assume 30 % increase responses Vivotif ( around 15 attrition rate ) sample size 75 group ( without zinc ) . Prevalence major enteric parasites child 2-5 year age urban Dhaka around 78 % . To see effect anti-parasitic drug therapy prior cholera typhoid vaccination , enroll 102 child group Dukoral ( n=102x2=204 ) another 102 child group Vivotif vaccine ( 102 x 2 = 204 ) . For vaccine , one group treat another . Thus plan study total 408 child determine effect anti-parasitic drug immune response oral cholera typhoid vaccine . To determine effect arsenic immune response Dukoral , assume immunogenicity vaccine among child arsenic non-contaminated area 55 % contaminated area reduce 35 % . To detect difference 95 % confidence 90 % power , estimate sample size 138 two study area . With around 10 % loss follow require sample size 154 . Thus , total 308 ( 154 x 2 = 308 ) child , age 2-5 year , enrol . To determine acute memory B T cell responses oral cholera vaccine , study conduct adult ( 18-45 year ) child different age group ( 1 -5 year ) . For part study , 25 adult , 25 toddler ( 2-5 year old ) , 25 under-two child vaccinate . For response Vivotif , study adult ( n=25 ) toddler ( n-25 ) . The participant study follow T B cell response prior immunization , early post-immunization period ( post- 7 day ) , 30 day , 6 , 12 24 month follow last dose . Administration associate intervention Effect zinc immune response Vivotif We would like study effect zinc immunogenicity oral typhoid vaccine cholera vaccine supplement child daily zinc sulfate ( 20 mg/day ) two week prior immunization last follow-up sample collection ( n=150 ) . Effect anti-parasitic drug immune response Vivotif Dukoral A total 408 child enrol see effect anti parasitic therapy prior cholera typhoid vaccination , equal cholera typhoid . For purpose child give albendazole ( 400 mg ) secnidazole ( 500 mg ) one week prior immunization . Study effect arsenic immune response Dukoral This study conduct child ( 2-5 year ) arsenic contaminate area ( Shahrasti ) arsenic free area ( Mirpur ) . For purpose , total 308 child ( 154 site ) enrol vaccinated Dukoral . This study first time compare immune response mucosal vaccine arsenic prone arsenic low area . Urine collect participant , prior immunization determine arsenic level . Determine acute memory B T cell responses oral cholera typhoid vaccine child adult : A total 150 subject vaccinate follow T B cell response period early post-immunization period ( 7 day post- ) , 30 day , 6 , 12 24 month later .</detailed_description>
