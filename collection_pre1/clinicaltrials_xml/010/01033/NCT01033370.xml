	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Blood Pressure Control Acute Aortic Emergencies - A Pilot Study ( PROMPT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase IV , open label , non-randomized efficacy safety pilot trial patient AAE hypertension require parenteral antihypertensive therapy . For purpose study hypertension define SBP ≥120 mm Hg immediately prior clevidipine administration . Patients enrol Methodist DeBakey Heart &amp; Vascular Center Houston , TX . Enrollment approximately 30 patient anticipated enrollment continue goal meet . The study include three separate period : Screening Period , Treatment Period ( 48 hour ) Follow-up Period ( 7 day hospital discharge , whichever occur first ) represent approximately maximum 7 day study . Eligible patient enrol receive clevidipine IV antihypertensive treatment ( study drug ) open label manner . Clevidipine infused initial rate 2 mg/h ( 4 mL/hr ) first 3 minute . Thereafter , titration high infusion rate attempt need obtain target SBP goal &lt; 120 mmHg . Titration effect proceed double dose every 3 minute , maximum 32 mg/h ( 64 mL/hr ) , SBP &lt; 120 mmHg attain . If desire BP lower effect attain study drug within 1 hour maintain thereafter , alternative antihypertensive agent may use , without stop clevidipine IV antihypertensive infusion . The alternative agent use per institutional treatment practice . During initial 1 hour treatment period , however , clevidipine IV antihypertensive treatment administer monotherapy 1 hour post initiation study drug . The use alternative antihypertensive agent ( ) discourage limit medically necessary maintain patient safety . Clevidipine IV antihypertensive infusion may continue maximum 48 hour . However , medically warrant , clevidipine treatment may continue beyond 48 hour investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>
