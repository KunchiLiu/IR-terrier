	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common diseases affect joint , usually weight bear knee . OA consider disease cartilage joint even though involves whole joint , include bone synovium ( thin lining joint produce synovial fluid ) . With time , cartilage destroy disease inflammation commonly occur . AS902330 expect increase production development specific bone cell : chondrocytes osteoblast ( cell produce maintain bone cartilage ) . This expected lead repair generation cartilage , narrow space width knee joint select region knee cartilage . The purpose study see safe treatment AS902330 , evaluate effect knee cartilage . In addition , study also measure effect AS902330 blood , reflect disease activity .</brief_summary>
