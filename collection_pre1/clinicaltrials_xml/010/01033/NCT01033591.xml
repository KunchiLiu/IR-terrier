	<brief_summary>Quality life decrease heart failure worsen one big worry patient . Physical exercise show safe intervention people heart failure . Previous study test heterogeneous exercise program use different QoL instrument report effect QoL inconsistent . The aim study evaluate effectiveness new exercise program people heart failure ( EFICAR ) , additional recommend optimal treatment primary care , improve QoL , functional capacity cardiovascular risk factor control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Patients With Heart Failure Primary Care : EFICAR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter clinical trial 150 patient heart failure NYHA class II-IV randomize two parallel group : EFICAR control . After recruit , reference cardiology service , six health centre Spanish Primary Care Prevention Health Promotion Research Network ( redIAPP ) , patient follow 1 year begin intervention . Both group receive optimize treatment accord European Society Cardiology guideline . In addition , EFICAR group perform 3 month supervise progressive exercise program aerobic ( high-intensity interval ) strength component ; programme continue link community resource 9 month . The main outcome measure change health-related QoL measure SF-36 Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaires baseline , 3 , 6 12 month . Secondary outcome consider change functional capacity measure 6-Minute Walking Test , cardiac structure ( B-type natriuretic peptide ) , muscle strength body composition . Both group compare intention treat basis , use multi-level longitudinal mixed model . Sex , age , social class , co-morbidity cardiovascular risk factor consider potential confounding predictor variable . Protocol intervention group The EFICAR group differs control group term exercise programme , two phase . The exercise programme combination `` high-intensity interval training '' `` muscular strength training '' . It demonstrate high intensity aerobic exercise lead good aerobic cardiovascular change light/moderate exercise patient HF • 1st PHASE ( 12 week , 3 sessions/week ) : first three month , patient carry progressive exercise programme 36 session supervision nurse , start low intensity ( first month ) increase month month . Aerobic training : Aerobic exercise undertaken cycloergometer , include warm-up , condition cool phase . From begin , exercise session personalise accord physical condition patient . The first month `` start-up '' , second `` progress '' third `` maintenance '' . For patient weak use aerobic exercise , first session light-to-moderate intensity . The Borg scale use evaluate `` perception effort '' session ( value range 6 20 ) . This useful scale determine intensity beta blocker , auricular fibrillation , pace-makers condition may alter normal response heart rate exercise . The exercise also monitor respect emergence symptom . Aerobic exercise do strength train guarantee activation muscle cardiovascular system . Muscular strength training : muscular strength work essential aspect rehabilitation patient HF . To avoid training-related increase hemodynamic load exercise isotonic . In session , 5 min stretch 8-12 min aerobic exercise , six type exercise carry work various muscle group : biceps , upper arm shoulder , knee extensor flexor , hip flexor extensor , plantar flexor . For muscular strength training , weight use upper body resistance band low body . A different percentage body weight applied muscular group . Each patient regularly inform progress make . • 2nd PHASE : The training give first phase intend ensure patient make exercise part routine . They train carry type interval aerobic exercise keep environment , indefinitely independently , together muscular strength exercise . In addition , teach self-regulate exercise intensity ( Borg Scale , pulsometers , symptom ) .</detailed_description>
