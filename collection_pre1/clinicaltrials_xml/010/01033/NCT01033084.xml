	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Treat Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) common mental disorder , lifetime prevalence 15 % incidence 5 % per year . Its core symptom include lack pleasure daily activity , thought guilt depressed mood . According World Health Organization , MDD one ten impair condition , lead miss workday , loss quality life increase expense health care . Besides , 1 % patient MDD complete suicide . Moreover , one third patient MDD remain depressed two adequate treatment , i.e. , refractory conventional antidepressant treatment ; also , treat patient remain residual symptom . Therefore , development new treatment necessary . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) novel , promise technique study several neuropsychiatric condition . Transcranial DCS non-invasive brain stimulation method low intensity direct current apply skull , neurophysiologic study show considerable amount electrical current reach brain tissue , vis-à-vis specified parameter . Thus , DC could apply brain MDD-related area , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , thereby lead neuroplasticity MDD treatment . Indeed , pilot study show tDCS might ameliorate depressive symptom . However , necessary replicate finding large population increase generalizability result verify efficacy intervention . Our aim perform double blind , randomize , factorial study compare tDCS sertraline MDD treatment , enrol 120 eligible patient gender 21-65 year present active suicidal ideation . They allocate 4 group random receive active tDCS sham sertraline 50mg/day placebo . Transcranial DCS apply daily basis 10 consecutive working day ( 2 week ) , , patient follow weekly 6 week . Our primary outcome depression rating score 6 week , measure Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , 17-itens . In conclusion , purpose perform clinical tDCS study verify efficacy treatment MDD sample patient several level severity refractoriness . Our secondary objective also verify safety intervention well compare tDCMajor Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) common mental disorder , lifetime prevalence 15 % incidence 5 % per year .
