	<brief_title>Calcineurin Inhibitor-free , Steroid-free Immunosuppressive Regimen Simultaneous Islet-Kidney Transplantation Uremic Type 1 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , open-label , non-randomized , prospective , pilot study 8 Type 1 diabetic/uremic patient , age 18-60 undergo simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation . Study include male and/or female subject . We hypothesize calcineurin inhibitor-free , steroid-free , co-stimulatory blockade-based immunosuppressive regimen , combination GLP-1 agonist , reduce islet mass require achieve sustain insulin independence follow simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation . Furthermore , anticipate improvement creatinine clearance reduction Interstitial Fibrosis/Tubular Atrophy transplant renal allograft , reduction `` de novo '' human anti-HLA antibody auto-antibody formation respective donor . Without calcineurin inhibitor steroid , hypothesize belatacept , conjunction sirolimus mycophenolic acid provide balance immunosuppression combine islet-kidney transplantation .</detailed_description>
