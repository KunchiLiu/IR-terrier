	<brief_summary>This study determine administration sodium nitrite safe improve small vessel blood flow tissue oxygenation give additional treatment patient acute vaso-occlusive crisis ( pain crisis ) associate sickle cell disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Sodium Nitrite Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) naturally occur chemical relaxes blood vessel help improve blood flow . The pain associate vaso-occlusive crisis ( pain crisis ) sickle cell disease cause part lack oxygen increase tissue acid blood flow block stiff sickle red cell . Administration sodium nitrite generate nitric oxide area hypoxia acidosis improve blood flow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects meet follow criterion consider admission study : 1 . Male female subject age 8 23 year age ; patient age 23 study Childrens Hospital Los Angeles 2 . Electrophoretic diagnosis sickle cell disease ; 3 . Sudden onset acute pain involve &gt; =1 sit typical vasoocclusive crisis ( Vasoocclusive crisis define acute , severe pain extremity , chest , abdomen , back explain complication sickle cell disease cause sickle cell disease . ) ; 4 . Severe pain require parenteral analgesic hospitalization . 5 . Informed consent obtain legal representative subject 18 year age old enrollment ; 6 . Being willing able follow least 30 day evaluation . Subjects present follow include study : 1 . Clinically significant bleeding ; 2 . Current drug abuse participation methadone program ; 3 . Episode pain require hospitalization within 2 week prior current admission ; 4 . Other complication sickle cell disease include cerebrovascular accident , pulmonary hypertension , seizure ; 5 . Pregnancy ( confirm serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test ) breast feeding ; 6 . Blood pressure le 25th percentile subject 's age sex admission time screen ; 7 . Methemoglobinemia &gt; 3 % ; 8 . Anemia hemoglobin level le 6 g/dL ; 9 . Red blood cell G6PD deficiency , laboratory test prior enrollment ; 10 . History allergy nitrite allergy substance characterize dyspnea cyanosis ; 11 . Treatment allopurinol , medication could interfere nitrite metabolism , within past 30 day screen ; 12 . Treatment investigational drug within past 30 day ; 13 . Significant acute chronic concomitant disease ( include renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , pulmonary , oncologic disease , sepsis , pulmonary edema , pulmonary embolism ) would inconsistent survival least 6 month ; 14 . Any subject judged clinical investigator study manager inappropriate study .</criteria>
