	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study adult male female , age 18 year , diagnosis glaucoma ocular hypertension . This trial perform 2 segment . In Segment 1 , subject randomize receive either CF101 1.0 mg , match placebo , give orally every 12 hour 16 week . Segment 1 enroll approximately 44 subject , randomize 3:1 ratio CF101 1.0 mg placebo . At conclusion Segment 1 , Data Review Committee ( DRC ) review safety efficacy data advise progression trial Segment 2 . Segment 2 enroll approximately 44 subject randomize 3:1 ratio CF101 2.0 mg 3:1 ratio receive CF101 2.0 mg , match placebo , give orally every 12 hour 16 week . At Screening Visit ( Visit 1 , perform within 4 week prior Baseline ) , subject provide write informed consent screening procedure perform , include complete medical , ophthalmologic , medication history ; physical examination ; vital sign weight ; electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; ophthalmologic examination ; tonometry ; visual field ( VF ) assessment ; corneal pachymetry ; evaluation inclusion exclusion criterion ; safety laboratory test ; serum pregnancy test females child-bearing potential ; collection concomitant medication information . Subjects successfully qualify randomized Baseline ( Visit 2 ) assign medication ( CF101 match placebo ) take orally every 12 hour 16 week . Subjects return assessment new supply study medication Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , final assessment discharge Week 16 . A safety telephone call make Week 18 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female , 18 year age ; 2 . Ocular hypertension openangle glaucoma least 1 eye , diagnose following : 1 . Untreated ocular hypertension without glaucomatous anatomic VF change ; 2 . Glaucoma diagnose within past 2 month untreated ; 3 . Previously treat glaucoma , provide previous medication treatment inefficacious and/or intolerable , therefore discontinue least 3 week prior Baseline ; 4 . Currently treat glaucoma inadequate IOP control , mean IOP remain target pressure judge Investigator despite ≥3 week treatment standard topical regimen ( guidance , European Glaucoma Society define `` target pressure '' follow : `` In case peak IOP = 8 mm 15 mmHg diurnal curve , 30 % IOP reduction baseline '' ) ; 3 . In subject receive standard topical treatment regimen ( per 2.d . ) , regimen dose change within 3 week Screening , expect remain stable throughout treatment period ; 4 . At Screening Baseline , IOP least 1 eye ( `` candidate '' eye ) &gt; 21 mmHg 08001000 hour &gt; 21 mmHg least 1 measurement least 3 hour follow first ; 5 . Corneal thickness 500 580 micron eye ; 6 .

Females childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test screen throughout study , eligible , continue participation , study ; 8 . Females childbearing potential must willing use 2 method contraception deem adequate Investigator ( eg , oral contraceptive pill plus barrier method ) eligible , continue participation , study ; 9 . Ability complete study compliance protocol ; 10 . Ability understand provide write informed consent . 1 . IOP &gt; 32 mmHg either eye ; 2 . History angleclosure glaucoma ; 3 . Anatomically narrow angle either eye ( ie , ≥75 % circumference angle must ≥Grade 2 Shaffer criterion ) ; 4 . In subject glaucoma , advance VF defect either eye , determine reliable test use Humphrey FullThreshold Algorithm Glaucoma Hemifield Test , define either : 1 . Mean deviation worse 16 dB , 2 . Threat fixation ( sensitivity 10 dB bad affect either test point closest point fixation upper hemifield either correspond test point low hemifield ) ; 5 .

Documented disc hemorrhage within past 5 year either eye ; 7 . Secondary cause IOP elevation ; 8 . Glaucoma laser treatment candidate eye within past 3 month ; 9 . Clinically significant ocular trauma candidate eye within past 6 month ; 10 . Any major ocular surgery past , include keratorefractive surgery , candidate eye , except uncomplicated cataract surgery perform great 6 month prior Screening ; 11 . Astigmatism &gt; 3 diopter either eye ; 12 . Clinically significant acute chronic ocular disease ( eg , corneal edema , uveitis , severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca , active ocular infection , active herpes simplex keratitis , blepharitis , acute conjunctivitis ) might interfere study ; 13 . Concomitant contact lens use ; 14 . Concomitant use systemic medication may affect IOP ( eg , beta blocker , corticosteroid , calcium channel blocker , ACE inhibitor , carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ) ; however , systemic antihypertensive medication allow provide dose regimen stable least 3 month prior Screening expect remain stable throughout trial ; 15 .
