	<brief_summary>There increase awareness towards ACL ( anterior cruciate ligament ) injuries Norwegian team , particularly handball soccer . The reported number reconstruction Norway range 1500 2000 per year , United States 50,000 100,000 per year , make ACL reconstruction one common orthopaedic procedure perform , especially among young , active healthy individual . However , report state subset patient ( 10-40 % ) remain subjectively objectively unstable and/or unable regain prior function . Additionally , report degenerative joint disease associate traditional single-bundle ACL reconstruction 50 % patient long term follow study . It well know ACL compose 2 functional bundle name tibial attachment , anteromedial ( AM ) posterolateral ( PL ) bundle . It believe current single-graft , single-bundle technique reconstruct anterior cruciate ligament anatomically reconstruct either one bundle . In last two year , double bundle technique introduce clinical study available , however RCTs . Further study important determine double-bundle ACL reconstruction perform , single-bundle reconstruction adjust well adapt biomechanical insufficiency restore internal rotation torque valgus moment , also try identify patient might better benefit single-bundle versus double-bundle ACL reconstruction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study : The primary aim compare two operational technique : single bundle hamstring versus double bundle hamstring ACL reconstruction , use KOOS ( Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ) Quality Life ( QoL ) subscore primary outcome clinical examination , functional test stand radiograph ( Kellgren Lawrence method ) secondary outcome measurement . Those assesments measure 1,2 5 year operation . Hypothesis : There difference two method judge KOOS QoL subscore . Questions answer : Is difference double-bundle single-bundle technique subjective outcome score measure KOOS score ? Are differences hamstring single bundle double bundle technique Lachman test pivot shift test use ? Is difference hamstring double-bundle technique single-bundle technique return sport activity level ? Are differences double-bundle technique single -bundle technique functional test ( one-leg hop test ) ? Is difference development osteoarthritis two technique ?</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Clinically verify ACL rupture ( history , Lachman test 2+ endpoint ; po pivot shift arthroscopically verify ) The graft use AM bundle minimum size 6.0 mm 5.0 mm PL bundle . PCL injury , ACL injury contra lateral knee &gt; 1+ medial lateralposterolateral ligament instability operation date Previous ACL reconstruction Meniscal injury leave &lt; 50 % meniscus intact Established OA judge Kellgren 34 .</criteria>
