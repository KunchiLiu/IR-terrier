	<brief_title>Study Effects Ciclesonide Hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) Nasal Aerosol Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal ( HPA ) Axis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , safety efficacy study effect ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol ciclesonide AQ nasal spray HPA axis , administer daily male female subject 12 year old diagnose Perennial Allergic Rhinitis ( PAR ) . The study consist screen period , single blind run period , 6 week double blind treatment period include active control segment , follow period . Placebo use control double-blind treatment period delivery method ( HFA nasal aerosol aqueous nasal spray ) study outcome analysis . There also positive control administer subset placebo subject last 4 day Week 6 ( dexamethasone placebo dexamethasone 6 mg ) . The active control utilized validate assay sensitivity ( ie , distinguish effective ineffective drug ) study , dexamethasone know HPA axis suppressant , therefore subset placebo subject include study outcome analysis . This study previously post Sepracor Inc . In October 2009 , Sepracor Inc. acquire Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma. , October 2010 , Sepracor Inc 's name change Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Give write informed consent assent , include privacy authorization well adherence concomitant medication withhold period , prior participation . Subject must general good health ( define absence clinically relevant abnormality determine Investigator ) base screen physical examination , medical history , clinical laboratory value ( Hematology , Chemistries Urinalysis ) . If screening Hematology , Chemistries , Urinalysis within clinical laboratory 's reference range , subject include Investigator judge deviation clinically significant . A history PAR relevant perennial allergen ( house dust mite , cockroach , mold , animal dander ) minimum two year immediately precede study Screening visit . The PAR must sufficient severity require treatment ( either continuous intermittent ) past require treatment throughout entire study period . A demonstrated sensitivity least one allergen know induce PAR ( house dust mite , animal dander , cockroach , mold ) base document result standard skinprick test either within 90 day prior screen perform Screening visit . A positive test define wheal diameter least 3 mm large negative control wheal skin prick test . The subject 's positive allergen test must consistent medical history PAR must present subject 's environment throughout study . Subject , female , must negative serum pregnancy test screening . Females childbearing potential must instruct agree avoid pregnancy study must use acceptable method birth control . 1 .

History physical finding nasal pathology , include nasal polyp clinically significant respiratory tract malformation ; recent nasal biopsy ; nasal trauma ; nasal ulcer perforation . Surgery atrophic rhinitis rhinitis medicamentosa permit within last 120 day prior Screening visit . Subject , investigator 's judgement , seasonal exacerbation time screen . Participation investigational drug trial within 30 day precede Screening visit plan participation another investigational drug trial time trial . A known hypersensitivity corticosteroid excipients formulation ciclesonide . History respiratory infection disorder [ include , limited bronchitis , pneumonia , influenza , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) ] within 14 day precede Screening visit . History alcohol drug abuse within 2 year precede Screening visit . History positive test HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C. Active asthma require treatment inhale systemic corticosteroid and/or routine use beta agonist controller drug ( eg , theophylline , leukotriene antagonist , etc . ) ; intermittent use ( less equal 3 us per week ) inhale short act betaagonists acceptable . Use short act betaagonists exerciseinduced bronchospasm allow . Expected use disallow concomitant medication treatment period . Initiation immunotherapy study period dose escalation study period . However , initiation immunotherapy 90 day prior Screening Visit use stable ( maintenance ) dose ( 30 day ) may consider inclusion . Previous randomization intranasal ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol study . Nonvaccinated exposure active infection , chickenpox measles within 21 day precede Screening Visit . Initiation pimecrolimus cream 1 % great tacrolimus ointment 0.03 % great study period plan dose escalation study period . However , initiation creams/ointments 30 day prior screen use stable ( maintenance ) dose study period may consider inclusion . Study participation clinical investigator site employee and/or immediate relative reside household . Study participation one subject household . Have follow condition judge investigator clinically significant and/or affect subject 's ability participate clinical trial : impaired hepatic function include alcohol relate liver disease cirrhosis ; history ocular disturbance , eg , glaucoma posterior subcapsular cataract ; systemic infection hematological , hepatic , renal , endocrine ( except control diabetes mellitus postmenopausal symptom hypothyroidism ; gastrointestinal disease ; malignancy ( exclude basal cell carcinoma ) ; current neuropsychological condition without drug therapy Any condition , judgment investigator , would preclude subject complete protocol capture assessment write .</criteria>
