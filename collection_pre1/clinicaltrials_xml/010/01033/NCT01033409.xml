	<brief_title>Recombinant Attenuated Salmonella Typhi Vaccine Vectors Producing Streptococcus Pneumoniae PspA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use attenuate Salmonella strain unable cause clinical disease trigger self-limiting infection lead stimulation protective immunity present attractive alternative kill subunit vaccine . Live , attenuate Salmonella strain show excellent carrier , vector , prokaryotic eukaryotic antigen , able stimulate strong systemic local immune response express antigen . Three Salmonella Typhi strain engineer express gene encode alpha-helical domain Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein , PspA , serve live biological vaccine vector propose clinical trial evaluate maximum safe tolerable single dose level oral administration subject . In Phase I study , healthy young adult 18-40 year age participate dose escalating , dose sequential study divide four Arms receive dos 10^7 , 10^8 , 10^9 10^10 CFU . Each Arm ( 1-4 ) consist 3 group 5 subject per group receive single oral dose one three recombinant attenuate S. Typhi vaccine vector produce pneumococcal antigen PspA . Each group per Arm receive dose one three vaccine total 60 subject ( 15 subject per dose-escalating Arm , 3 group per Arm , 5 subject per group ) . Subject participation last 6 month receive oral vaccine dosage approximately first 12-15 day ( study Days 0-14 ) confinement . Release criterion include 2 negative blood culture row study Day 7 ( inpatient monitoring 8 day ) 2 negative stool culture row study Day 5 . The objective study 1 ) evaluate maximum safe tolerable single dose level three recombinant attenuate S. Typhi vaccine vector use dose-escalation , dose-sequential study healthy adult subject , 2 ) evaluate immunogenicity three recombinant attenuate S. Typhi vaccine vector regard ability induce mucosal systemic antibody response S. pneumoniae PspA S. Typhi antigens . The vaccine anticipate prevent disease . Although immune response generate vaccine vector may confer degree protection future infection S. pneumoniae S. Typhi , protection incidental . It goal study develop test either pneumonia typhoid vaccine , select S. Typhi vector provide optimal delivery PspA antigen safe immunogenic manner .</detailed_description>
