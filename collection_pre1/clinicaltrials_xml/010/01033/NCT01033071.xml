	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Azilsartan Medoxomil Chlorthalidone Compared Olmesartan Medoxomil Hydrochlorothiazide Participants With Moderate Severe Hypertension .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . Despite availability antihypertensive agent , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one third patient continue maintain control successfully . Treatment algorithms essential hypertension commonly include thiazide thiazide-like diuretic , either alone part combination treatment . Chlorthalidone commercially available , orally administer thiazide-type diuretic agent . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) angiotensin II receptor blocker develop Takeda treat participant essential hypertension . This study compare safety tolerability azilsartan medoxomil plus chlorthalidone ( TAK-491CLD ) fixed-dose combination olmesartan medoxomil plus hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination .</detailed_description>
