	<brief_summary>Background : - Advanced case non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) usually successfully treated standard therapy . Even treatment attempt specifically target NSCLC cell prove effective . - Researchers interested determine whether combination chemotherapy drug SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 , paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab may effective shrink size NSCLC tumor . Three drug ( paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab ) commercially available , drug currently test determine usefulness cancer treatment . This study help determine combination four drug effective safe , safe , less safe drug combination give treat NSCLC . Objectives : - To determine safe tolerable dose combination SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab patient advance mesothelin-expressing lung adenocarcinoma . Eligibility : - Age &gt; 18 year age - Newly diagnose advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma - No prior chemotherapy lung cancer - Individuals least 18 year age advance non-small-cell lung carcinoma respond standard treatment . Design : - The study last two 21-day cycle treatment four-drug combination , additional treatment cycle carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab . - Two three week prior study , participant screen full medical history physical exam , bone marrow biopsy ( bone marrow biopsy ) ( one perform last 6 month ) , compute tomography ( CT ) ultrasound scan , tumor measurement , test require researcher . Participants provide blood urine sample time well . - During study , participant receive SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 , carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab maximum two cycle . On Day 15 first cycle , participant provide blood sample test see SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 effective . If test show SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 effective , participant receive another dose , continue receive paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab second cycle . - After first two cycle , participant continue receive carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab every 3 week ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 With Paclitaxel , Carboplatin , Bevacizumab Subjects With Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Treatment platinum-based doublet chemotherapy result median survival 7 10 month patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . - In randomized clinical trial patient non-squamous cell lung cancer , treatment carboplatin , paclitaxel bevacizumab result objective response rate 35 % , overall survival 12.3 month compare objective response rate 15 % , overall survival 10.3 month patient treat carboplatin paclitaxel alone . - Mesothelin cell surface glycoprotein present normal mesothelial cell highly express many human cancer include lung adenocarcinoma . - SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin undergone phase I test currently clinical trial combination pemetrexed cisplatin treatment malignant pleural mesothelioma . - Pre-clinical study demonstrate increase anti-tumor activity SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 combination chemotherapy bevacizumab mesothelin-expressing tumor . Primary Objectives : - This phase I study determine safe tolerable phase II dose combination SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 paclitaxel , carboplatin bevacizumab patient advance mesothelin-expressing lung adenocarcinoma . Secondary Objectives : - To assess response rate , duration response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) . - To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 combination chemotherapy bevacizumab . - Monitor serum mesothelin level prior chemotherapy . - To identify T-cell epitope responsible neutralize SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 activity use mononuclear cell obtain apheresis . Eligibility : - Histologically confirm stage IIIB ( malignant pleural effusion ) IV recurrent NSCLC ( non-squamous cell , mesothelin expression great equal 10 % tumor cell IHC ) . - Adequate organ bone marrow function . - ECOG performance status 0-1 . Design : - Open label phase I trial .</detailed_description>
