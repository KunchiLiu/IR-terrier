	<brief_summary>To carry exploratory study determine activity regimen correlate tumor patient associate marker EGF-R/mTOR pathway These marker may correlate activity regimen provide exploratory insight mechanism treatment approach . Expression pathway component include EGF-R phosphorylated EGF-R ( p-EGF-R ) , ERK p-ERK , Akt p-Akt ( T308 S473 ) , p70s6k p-p70s6k , S6 p-S6 , HIF-1-alpha , p27 4E-BP1 assessed . Mutation FISH analysis EGF-R expression also perform tumor sample . Biopsies obtain follow time : pre-treatment , 4 week ( one cycle ) treatment . If available , original diagnostic tissue may submit place pre-treatment biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study RAD001 Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study efficacy RAD001 proceed two stage method Simon . In first stage 15 patient accrue treat . If 9 few patient show clinical benefit study terminate . If 10 patient show clinical benefit study proceed second stage , accrue additional 26 patient . If second stage complete total 29 patient show clinical benefit among 41 patient treat , treatment CBR consider high enough warrant study . Conversely , evaluation RAD001 conclude first stage , 28 few patient experience clinical benefit complete second stage , therapy consider study . Current knowledge molecular mechanism cancer-related pathway involve cellular signaling , cell cycle regulation cell death yield therapy direct specific component pathway , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF-R ) , mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF-R ) insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IFG-R ) . Both small molecule monoclonal antibody therapy direct target available . Furthermore , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) mutation analysis available profile expression pathway component , raise possibility individualize prognosis therapy . One receptor particular , prognostic factor therapeutic target HNSCC . Upregulation EGF-R expression aberrant activation kinase cascade downstream receptor occur early process carcinogenesis play major role malignant progression.1 The level EGF-R expression correlate recurrence poor prognosis HNSCC . A well tolerate anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , show remarkable activity HNSCC , include statistically significant improvement survival patient locally advanced disease treat radiotherapy , lead regulatory approval disease.2 Unfortunately , despite survival advance achieve EGF-R inhibitor , majority ( ~60 % ) patient advanced disease refractory EGF-R direct therapies.3 One anticipate mechanism current regimen may fail patient upregulation escape pathway downstream EGF-R. A pathway particular interest PI3/AKT/mTOR axis , within mTOR protein may target tyrosine kinase inhibitor RAD001 . In order investigate pathway component may act escape mechanism concurrently target downstream kinase may enable rescue resistance EGF-R direct therapy , propose prospective , phase II , single-arm , single-agent interventional clinical trial RAD001 patient refractory SCCHN . The primary outcome activity RAD001 secondary outcome include safety , toxicity extensive laboratory correlate perform tumor tissue . By carry clinic-translational trial novel mTOR inhibitor , RAD001 , patient refractory SCCHN , aim explore mechanisms activity resistance inhibitor EGF-R pathway component measure clinical activity RAD001 .</detailed_description>
