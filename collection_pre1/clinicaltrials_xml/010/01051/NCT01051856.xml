	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find low leak rate follow distal pancreatectomy ( removal leave side pancreas ) . Distal pancreatectomy know risk pancreatic leak ( leakage pancreatic fluid cut surface pancreas ) . Two FDA clear device ( TissueLink SEAMGUARD ) study treat prevent leak end pancreas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TissueLink Versus SEAMGUARD After Distal Pancreatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective trial compare effectiveness TissueLink closure pancreatic stump distal pancreatectomy SEAMGUARD reinforce stapler closure . Distal pancreatectomy perform broad variety indication include benign malignant condition . Specifically , distal pancreatectomy refers resection portion pancreas leave superior mesenteric vein/portal vein trunk , exclude duodenum distal bile duct . Pancreatic duct leak resection margin one common complication distal pancreatectomy . This complication prolong in-patient outpatient care result significant detriment patient 's operative experience increase financial burden pancreatic surgery .</detailed_description>
