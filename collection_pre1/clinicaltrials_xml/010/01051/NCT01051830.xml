	<brief_title>A Care Model Hip-fractured Elderly Persons With Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical scientific significance . Health outcome , well physical cognitive function , show negatively impacted comorbidity beyond bare sum effect due single disease . One comorbidity diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , global health issue fifth major cause death Taiwan 1987 2001 . Starting 2002 , DM become fourth . Hip-fractured elderly person DM show previous study significantly high mortality readmission rate poorer recovery walk ability various physical health outcome without DM first year discharge . Clinical evidence show elderly patient hip fracture benefit postoperative rehabilitation , early discharge-planning program , transitional care program . However , little known effective intervention specifically hip fractured patient DM . Research Purposes . The purpose study 1 ) develop well-conceived feasible protocol hospital discharge subacute care hip-fractured elderly person DM , 2 ) compare cost effectiveness DM-specific model effective subacute care model previously develop research team . Data Methods . A clinical trial 1-year follow-up use compare cost-effectiveness DM-specific model 88 hip-fractured elderly patient subacute care model ( n=88 ) routine care ( n=88 ) . Patients recruit emergency room Chang Gung Memorial Hospital ( CGMH ) Lin Kuo . Subjects assess surgery , discharge , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month discharge biometric measure , DM-related outcome , clinical outcome , self-care ability , health-related quality life , service utilization , cost care . To maximize outcome sensitive intervention , biometric measure activity include , i.e. , daily energy consumption arterial stiffness index . DM-related variable include haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , tendon reflex , superficial deep sensation , peripheral pulse , diabetic retinopathy , sign `` diabetic foot , '' use medication , clinical procedure . The study already approve Institutional Review Board CGMH . Trajectories outcome variable predictor analyze generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) approach . The cost three care model also compare . Findings study contribute current knowledge practice elderly patient DM recover hip-fracture surgery .</detailed_description>
