	<brief_summary>Background : - Indenoisoquinolines experimental cancer treatment drug damage DNA cell , result cell death . Researchers study drug usefulness treat type cancer respond well standard therapy like surgery radiation . - LMP400 ( NSC 743400 ) LMP776 ( NSC 725776 ) indenoisoquinolines give cancer patient . These drug similar chemical structure work way , researcher know one work best . More information need LMP400 LMP776 process body effective treat difficult-to-treat type cancer . Objectives : - To determine maximum tolerate dose LMP400 ( NSC 743400 ) LMP776 ( NSC 725776 ) . - To study body handle LMP400 LMP776 . - To evaluate effectiveness LMP400 LMP776 treatment tumor lymphoma responded standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age malignant solid tumor Hodgkin disease/non-Hodgkin lymphoma respond standard therapy . Design : - Participants receive either LMP400 LMP776 . The treatment cycle 28 day . On first 5 day cycle , participant receive intravenous dos specific study drug , follow 23 day without drug . The 28-day cycle repeat long drug cause severe side effect cancer remain stable improves . The study doctor may increase decrease dose study drug depend well tolerate . - Blood , urine , hair sample skin tumor biopsy collect first treatment cycle . Routine blood sample take throughout study . - Other test , include additional blood urine sample , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , bone marrow sample , may perform direct study doctor ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Indenoisoquinolines LMP400 LMP776 Adults With Relapsed Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Indenoisoquinolines non-camptothecin inhibitor topoisomerase 1 ( top1 ) improve characteristic predecessor . Indenoisoquinolines well chemical stability , produce stable DNA-top1 cleavage complex , exhibit preference unique DNA cleavage site , compare camptothecin counterpart . - They demonstrate activity camptothecin-resistant cell line produce DNA-protein crosslinks , resistant reversal . They also show less resistance cell overexpressing ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter , ABCG2 , multidrug resistance ( MDR-1 ) . Primary Objectives : - Define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) LMP400 ( NSC 743400 ) LMP776 ( NSC 725776 ) administer intravenously ( IV ) daily 5 day ( QDx5 ) . - Define dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) toxicity profile associate administration LMP400 LMP776 . - Evaluate effect LMP400 LMP776 pharmacodynamic ( PD ) endpoint , gamma-H2AX , tumor biopsy pre- post-treatment . In particular , compare PD response , define mean percent nuclear area gamma-H2AX positive ( % NAP ) tumor biopsy , MTD LMP400 LMP776 , toxicity profile versus PD dose-response relationship . Secondary Objectives : - Obtain preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity LMP400 LMP776 . - Characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile LMP400 LMP776 . Eligibility : -Adult patient must histologically confirm relapsed solid tumor malignancy lymphoma metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist associate minimal patient survival benefit . Study Design : - Cycle 1 subsequent cycle : Patients randomize receive either LMP400 LMP776 administer IV QD 1 hour day 1-5 follow 23 day without drug ( 28-day cycle ) . - PK PD sample collect cycle 1 . Tumor biopsy collect escalation phase ; however , tumor biopsy mandatory expansion phase .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically document ( confirmed Laboratory Pathology , NCI ) , relapse solid tumor malignancy Hodgkin disease/nonHodgkin lymphoma metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist , associate minimal patient survival benefit . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Patients must recover least eligibility level due adverse event ( AEs ) and/or toxicity prior chemotherapy biologic therapy . They must chemotherapy biologic therapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , 2 month UCN01 ) , therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor within 5 time halflife inhibitor prior enter study . Patients must ( Bullet ) 2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study ( also refer early Phase I study prePhase I study subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) PI discretion , recover eligibility level toxicity . Patients must recover least Grade le equal toxicity eligibility level due adverse event ( AEs ) and/or toxicity prior chemotherapy biologic therapy . They must chemotherapy biologic therapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , 2 month UCN01 ) , therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor within 5 time halflife inhibitor prior enter study . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND/Phase 0 study . Patients must great equal 1 month since completion prior radiation ( great equal 2 week palliative radiation therapy ) . However , patient receive bisphosphonates cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer eligible therapy . Prior therapy topoisomerase I inhibitors allow . Age great equal 18 year . The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin* within less equal 1.5 normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine le 1.5 time upper limit normal OR Creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/minute patient ( measure ) creatinine level great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal *we allow patient Gilbert syndrome total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL The effect indenoisoquinolines develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 2 month discontinuation study . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test order eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk nursing infant secondary treatment mother indenoisoquinolines , breastfeed discontinue mother treated indenoisoquinolines . Willingness undergo skin biopsy . At point tumor biopsies become mandatory rather optional , disease amenable biopsy willingness undergo biopsy patient undergoing procedure due medical necessity tissue may collect , tumor biopsy tissue previous research study medical care available submission registration . Criteria submission tissue : Tissue must collect within 3 month prior registration Patient receive intervening therapy cancer since collection tumor sample Tumor tissue must meet minimum requirement outline Section 9.1 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 2 month treatment brain metastasis , without steroid antiseizure medication . These patient may enrol discretion principal investigator . Patients clinically significant illness could compromise participation study , include , limited , active uncontrolled infection , immune deficiency , know HIV infection require antiretroviral therapy , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
