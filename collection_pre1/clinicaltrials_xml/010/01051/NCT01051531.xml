	<brief_title>A Safety , Tolerability , Treatment Response Study Paliperidone Palmitate Administered Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 18-month , single-group , open-label ( name study drug know patient ) , multicenter study evaluate safety , tolerability treatment response paliperidone palmitate administer once-monthly injection patient schizophrenia previously receive treatment oral antipsychotic medication . A target 587 patient ( inpatient outpatient ) schizophrenia enrol study receive , without cost , injection study drug ( paliperidone palmitate ) Days 1 , 8 , 38 , thereafter one-month interval 18 month . Enrollment study limit patient diagnose schizophrenia within past 5 year . The study consist screen period 5 day treatment , 18-month treatment period , end-of-study early withdrawal visit approximately 30 day last injection study drug . During screen period ( patient provide sign informed consent participate study ) , information collect regard patient medical psychiatric history , demographic ( age race ) , current symptom patient schizophrenia , whether patient would like sign additional inform consent form participate pharmacogenomic ( study gene affect person 's response drug ) component study involve collection one 10 ml blood sample ( equivalent 2 teaspoon blood ) . During screening , entry criterion study review physical examination perform . Patients also ask question type healthcare resource ( institutionalizations/hospitalizations , emergency room visit , etc ) utilize previous 12 month however , information optional collection depend upon availability data . Patients currently receive treatment oral antipsychotic medication must discontinue use medication Day 1 study . If patient receive high dose antipsychotic medication also receive anticholinergic medication ( drug prevents involuntary muscle movement associate use antipsychotic drug treatment schizophrenia ) , investigator may decide patient dose antipsychotic ( and/or anticholinergic ) medication taper ( gradually reduce ) discontinuation begin Day 1 . The patient time taper-off previous antipsychotic and/or anticholinergic medication depend dose medication . Patients receive anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety drug ) , mood stabilizer , anticholinergic , antidepressant great 4 week screen visit allow continue take drug . Upon meet entry criterion study , patient receive total 19 intramuscular ( IM ) injection paliperidone palmitate 18-month treatment period follow : 150 mg equivalent ( eq ) Day 1 , 100 mg eq Day 8 , 75 mg eq Day 38 , paliperidone palmitate injection 50 , 75 , 100 , 150 mg eq monthly Days 68 , 98 , 128 , 158 , 188 , 218 , 248 , 278 , 308 , 338 , 368 , 398 , 428 , 458 , 488 518 . Depending patient ability tolerate dose paliperidone palmitate , dos may adjust high low every 30 day per clinician judgment within dose range 50 150 mg eq . If patient report sign symptom worsen schizophrenia , investigator may prescribe rescue medication ( quick-relief fast-acting medication usually work right away relieve symptom ) lorazepam ( antianxiety drug ) control agitation , irritability , restlessness , hostility . The investigator may also prescribe anticholinergic medication treat involuntary movement disorder observe patient . All prescription over-the-counter medication take patient study report . At end 18-month treatment period , patient complete end-of-study visit ( early withdrawal visit patient complete study ) physical examination perform , laboratory test ( include urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ) perform , vital sign measure , information collect regard occurrence adverse event use medication study drug time previous study visit end-of-study ( early withdrawal visit ) . The primary objective study evaluate safety , tolerability treatment response once-monthly injection paliperidone palmitate measure use Positive And Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS ) . The safety tolerability once-monthly injection paliperidone palmitate administer patient schizophrenia evaluate study monitor adverse event , finding clinical laboratory test ( serum chemistry include lipid ) , vital sign measurement ( blood pressure , pulse rate , weight ) , physical examination , movement disorder evaluation use Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale [ ESRS-A ] ) . All clinically significant abnormality patient persist end study follow Investigator resolution clinically stable endpoint reach . Treatment response evaluate 5 time study ( Visits 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10 ) finding obtain PANSS ( 30-item questionnaire administer patient qualified person [ ie , rater ] measure presence/absence severity positive negative symptom schizophrenia . In addition safety , tolerability , treatment response data collect , patient volunteer participate pharmacogenomic component study one 10 ml sample blood collect Days Visit 2 . If replacement blood sample need pharmacogenomic component study , patient need sign additional inform consent form . Patients receive paliperidone palmitate intramuscular ( IM ) injection 150 mg equivalent ( eq ) Day 1 , 100 mg eq Day 8 , 75 mg eq Day 38.Thereafter , patient receive monthly IM injection 50 , 75 , 100 , 150 mg eq paliperidone palmitate . Doses may adjust every 30 day per clinician 's judgment within dose range 50 150 mg eq.Patients receive total 19 injection study drug 18-month treatment period .</detailed_description>
