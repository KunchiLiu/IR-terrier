	<brief_summary>Improved Assessment Visual Field Change trial aim investigate mechanisms visual field test variability . The investigator find use large stimulus size substantially lower short-term variability . In study , investigator determine large stimulus detect visual field change earlier time . The investigator also develop statistical model account correlation neighbor test location .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disease optic nerve , include glaucoma , lead cause blindness United States . Treatment decision optic nerve disease base largely change visual function occur mostly consequence disease progression . Unfortunately , decision whether change visual function occur often difficult high retest variability conventional visual field test ( perimetry ) . This variability high moderate visual loss , minimum six test often need patient optic nerve damage reliably distinguish visual field deterioration random variation . The preliminary data show substantial portion variability perimetry lie type stimulus use test strategy apply . OBJECTIVES : The investigator propose test hypothesis large portion total perimetric variability patient visual loss due poor signal-to-noise ratio associate use small fixed-size stimulus . RESEARCH PLAN AND METHODS : To test hypothesis , investigator examine patient optic nerve disease conventional automated perimetry ( size III ) test large-sized scaled stimulus ( size V , size VI ( custom perimeter ) luminance size threshold perimetry - test threshold find change stimulus size rather stimulus intensity ) . Over four year investigator test 100 patient glaucoma 60 normal eight time . In addition , investigator retesting 50 subject week 5 week . The investigator also study associate structural-functional correlation use OCT develop statistical model account correlation neighbor test location . Perimetric variability reliable identification visual field change single difficult problem visual testing today . The investigator anticipate identify method allow efficient accurate determination visual field change . Identification superior method would ( 1 ) reduce number examination need , thereby reduce cost medical care ; ( 2 ) minimize misdiagnosis , unnecessary test even unnecessary surgery result mistakenly interpret fluctuation visual field progression improvement ; ( 3 ) allow early disease intervention ( 4 ) reduce cost clinical trial .</detailed_description>
