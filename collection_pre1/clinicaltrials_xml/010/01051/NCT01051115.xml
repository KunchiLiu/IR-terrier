	<brief_summary>Patients chemo refractory CLL poor prognosis . 2 independent mechanisms attribute development chemoresistance CLL . The first shift balance pro- anti-apoptotic regulator . The second mechanism base acquire mutation result dysfunctional p53 response . Recent study indicate tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib act synergistically purine analogy alkylating agent . Also , dasatinib potency restore apoptotic balance CLL cell . Hypothesis : Dasatinib clinically active chemo-refractory CLL patient act synergistically purine-analogue fludarabine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Combination Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) With Refractory Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common leukemia western world . The disease mostly affect elderly . At present curative therapy available . Although majority patient initially respond chemotherapy , patient eventually develop drug resistance . The prognosis patient chemotherapy resistant disease poor wit overall survival approximately 10 month . Standard therapy patient currently exist . Treatment monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab could try , however toxicity drug high especially follow multiple cycle chemotherapy . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation still consider experimental set available minority patient . The development chemoresistant disease highly correlate disturbed balance apoptosis regulating molecule , result decrease sensitivity apoptotic stimulus . The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib ( Sprycel® ) successfully use treatment chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . This form chronic leukemia also characterize disturbed balance apoptosis regulate gene , restore tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Recent study indicate also CLL , dasatinib potential restore apoptotic balance . In clinical study investigate whether dasatinib effective drug treatment chemoresistant CLL whether treatment dasatinib restore sensitivity chemotherapeutic agent . Objective study : Primary : To determine response rate response quality dasatinib monotherapy dasatinib/fludarabine combination fludarabine refractory CLL patient Secondary To asses overall safety profile treatment approach To asses event free survival ( i.e . time registration induction failure , progression , relapse death whichever occur first ) , progression free survival ( i.e . time registration disease progression , relapse death due CLL whichever occur first ) disease free survival ( i.e . time CR relapse ) To ass influence dasatinib expression profile apoptosis regulatory gene . To determine whether dasatinib act synergistically immuno-chemotherapeutic agent co-culture experiment . Study design : Prospective , multi center clinical trial Study population : Patients CLL need treatment AND fludarabine refractory , age 18-80 year inclusive Intervention : Patients treat dasatinib monotherapy 100mg daily . At four week patient re-evaluated . Patients less partial response receive fludarabine ( orally 40mg/daily 3 day q28 ) addition dasatinib . After two cycle fludarabine , response evaluate . In case progressive disease follow 2 cycle fludarabine combination dasatinib , patient go study . All patient treat four cycle fludarabine combination daily dasatinib treatment . Patients receive monotherapy initial 28 day develop progressive disease 'cross-over ' combination treatment . Primary study parameters/outcome study : -- Clinical response rate quality ( CR , PR ) 32 week -In case complete response : minimal residual disease status Secondary : - Overall safety profile determine incidence clinically significant adverse event . - Event free survival ( i.e . time registration induction failure , progression , relapse death whichever occur first ) , progression free survival ( i.e . time registration disease progression , relapse death due CLL whichever occur first ) disease free survival ( i.e . time CR relapse ) Extensive ( functional ) In vitro study dasatinib treat cell perform : - Expression profile apoptosis regulatory gene mRNA level ( MLPA ) protein level ( western blot ) - Study vitro synergy dasatinib treatment different chemotherapeutic immunotherapeutic drug Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness ( applicable ) : The monitoring patient treatment follow-up accord standard procedure treatment patient CLL . This mean physical examination regular frequency ( 7 time registration end treatment ; every 3 month follow-up ) , blood sample analysis ( 9 time registration end treatment ; every 3 month follow-up ) , bone marrow analysis ( 2 time registration end treatment ) CT-scan ( 4 time registration end treatment ) . In addition , ECG perform entry study . Hematological side-effects dasatinib cytopenia . Especially drop leukocyte thrombocyte report . In case , cytopenia control dose adjustment . A temporarily inflammation liver occur ( &lt; 3 % patient ) case reversible dose adjustment . Most report side-effects nausea , muscle cramp , painful joint , headache , fluid retention ( include pleural effusion ) gain weight . Most side-effects successfully manage dose-adjustment . Side-effects fludarabine dose study temporarily cytopenia , nausea , emesis , diarrhea , mucositis , liver function abnormality , fever , rash , conjunctivitis dizziness .</detailed_description>
