	<brief_summary>This trial compare HPV test routine colposcopy follow-up woman treat cervical high grade lesion . Women assign randomly ( chance ) treatment cervical pre-cancer either ( 1 ) followed-up colposcopy , ( 2 ) undergo HPV testing . Women find disease either strategy offer re-treatment . For next 2 year participant undergo yearly , depth , evaluation ass cervix precancer . We able compare 2 follow-up strategy work best .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colposcopy Versus HPV Testing Identify Persistent Cervical Precancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rational : Cervical cancer rank twelfth term cancer mortality Canadian woman , remain second frequent cancer Canadian woman age 20-44 . Fortunately , natural history make ideal candidate successful prevention . Cervical cancer precursor cause persistent infection cervical epithelium one 15 oncogenic ( high risk ) type human papillomaviruses ( HPVs ) . The preinvasive change cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) identify cervical cytology ( also know Pap test ) . When cellular abnormality identify , woman refer diagnostic testing . High-grade precursor lesion ( CIN2/3 ) carry high risk progression invasive cancer reason treatment recommend . Treatment success rate CIN2/3 85 % . However , fail treatment need identify promptly risk invasive disease increase 10 fold . The current strategy use Canada identify treatment failure consist follow-up every 6 month colposcopy clinic 2 year . Recent research underline fact routine colposcopy unreliable may miss significant lesion . The identification oncogenic HPV DNA cervical secretion know HPV test . A study investigate use HPV test identification treatment failure . Although point good sensitivity ( 90-95 % ) methodological limitation : study small ; HPV test use often suitable clinical laboratory use ; endpoint assess histological confirmation . Most importantly , none compare HPV test colposcopy , strategy use Canada . Research question : Is HPV test sensitive routine colposcopy identify CIN2/3 treatment failure ? Methodology : Design : We propose parallel randomize controlled trial , participant randomize 1:1 routine colposcopy vs. HPV test treatment CIN2/3 lesion . Study Population : Women treat high-grade precursor lesion . Exclusion criterion : pregnancy , less 18 year age , know immunosuppression immunodeficiency , unable provide inform consent . Study intervention : ( 1 ) HPV test Hybrid Capture 2 . ( 2 ) Routine colposcopy . In order evaluate performance current follow-up strategy , standardize protocol colposcopy intervention , documentation procedure do . Patients receive study intervention 6 month treatment . All participant undergo expert diagnostic assessment 12 24 . Sample size calculation recruitment rate . The sample size calculate 80 % power detect increase sensitivity 15 % , alpha set 0.05 ( double side test ) . Assuming conservative baseline sensitivity 70 % colposcopy , 134 case recurrent/persistent disease necessary study group . Assuming 15 % failure rate treatment 20 % drop rate , total 2250 participant need accrue . Recruitment take place high volume colposcopy clinic across Canada 2 year . Analysis : The primary analysis consist comparison diagnostic index 2 follow-up strategy : sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value ( 95 % asymptotic confidence interval ) . Cumulative persistent/recurrent case identify 2 year follow-up make case group . Since participant undergo expert diagnostic assessment . No subgroup analysis perform . 4 . Expected contribution : The result trial provide high quality data base management recommendation . If HPV test find sensitive routine colposcopy , follow-up treat lesion may occur mainly primary care physician 's office HPV testing , reduce cost , make possible focus colposcopy activity group woman truly risk significant disease .</detailed_description>
