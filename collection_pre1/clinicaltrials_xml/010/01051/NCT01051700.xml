	<detailed_description>The purpose study characterize fully safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics single repeat oral dos pazopanib low dos previously study . The first part study design open-label , non-randomized , single session , parallel-group , sequential dose-rising investigate pharmacokinetics single oral dos healthy adult subject . In second part study , healthy elderly subject participate one 14 day repeat-dose session , randomize receive either pazopanib placebo . Dose escalation within Part 2 , base upon emerge safety PK data precede repeat dose cohort least 7 day safety data well emerge safety PK data single dose . The elderly population choose second part study closely reflect target population AMD indication . The result current study assist dose selection subsequently plan study patient AMD .</detailed_description>
