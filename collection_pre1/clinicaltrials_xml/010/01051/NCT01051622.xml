	<brief_summary>Using scintigraphic image include planar scintigraphy SPECT , study evaluate utility two different ex vivo 99mTc-HMPAO labelled mononuclear cell population order select optimal methodology ( use PBMC purify lymphocyte subpopulation ) future drug intervention study Crohn 's disease . Two parallel exploratory approach investigate enrich lymphocyte population express leukocyte trafficking inhibitor . In first , whole blood fractionate ficoll gradient purify heterogeneous population peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) labelling .

	<brief_title>PBMC ( Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ) /Lymphocyte SPECT ( Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography ) Imaging Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study base establish technology scintigraphic 'white cell scan ' , leukocytes limited volume patient 's blood radiolabeled indium-111 technetium-99m , re-introduced circulation , subsequent traffic accumulation area active inflammation visualise scintigraphic imaging . This methodology routinely use diagnosis inflammatory condition pharmacodynamic change document literature . As intended technology could use future drug intervention study . However , sub-population labelling methodology remain exploratory , study investigate utility technique use future clinical trial Crohn 's patient . Two parallel exploratory approach investigate enrich lymphocyte population express leukocyte trafficking inhibitor . In first , whole blood fractionate ficoll gradient purify heterogeneous population peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) labelling . Secondly , T lymphocytes enrich depletion monocytes B cell PBMC fraction . In part A one scintigraphy scan perform healthy volunteer confirm purification label procedure show abnormal biodistribution compare known physiological distribution label mononuclear cell [ Bennink , 2008 ] . In part B , Crohn 's disease patient recruit undergo two scintigraphy scan 48-72 hour apart establish intra-patient variability feasibility repeat procedure use subsequent study therapeutic intervention . Analysis SPECT image perform use standardize scoring system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Part A : 1 . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , vital sign , ECG , complete blood count clinical chemistry . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Part A B : 2 . Male female 18 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . 3 . A female subject eligible participate : • Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method Section 8.1 wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Part B : 4 . A history CD least 3 month diagnosis confirm radiologic , endoscopic histological assessment . 5 . Moderate severe CD evidence elevated retrospective CDAI score ( ≥150 ) 1 follow : CRP ( ≥5 mg/L ) ; recent ( within 4 week screen visit ) evidence active CD CT scan , MRI scan endoscopy . Scans must part patient routine care conduct screen test study . 6 . Radiographic ( barium , CT , MRI ) endoscopic evidence small bowel involvement ( patient surgical intervention , evidence small bowel involvement must obtain procedure ) . Exclusion A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Part A B : 1 . Known positive infection hepatitis B , hepatitis C HIV . 2 . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior Day 1 current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . 3 . Previous inclusion research and/or medical protocol involve nuclear medicine , PET radiological investigation significant radiation burden ( significant radiation burden define ICRP category IIb : 10 mSv addition natural background radiation , previous 3 year include dose study ) . Part B : 4 . Patients active Crohn 's disease small bowel involvement yet receive treatment judge inappropriate defer initiate steroid treatment 13 day ( maximum interval screen last imaging session ) . 5 . Patients corticosteroid dependent judge inappropriate defer increase dose steroid initiate treatment 13 day ( maximum interval screen last imaging session ) . 6 . Patients refractory steroid immunosuppressant antiTNFs judge inappropriate defer change medical management surgical intervention 13 day ( maximum interval screen last imaging session ) . 7 . The subject take &gt; 20mg/day Prednisolone prednisolone equivalent 4 week prior screen 8 . The subject receive treatment natalizumab within 12 week prior study entry ; 9 . The subject Hb &lt; 10 g/l Lymphocyte count &lt; 10^9 /l 10 . Known C. difficile infection , clinical suspicion pathogenic bowel infection ( include significant infection due fistula ) . 11 . Suspected diagnosed intraabdominal abscess bowel perforation 12 . The subject bowel surgery ( appendectomy ) within 12 week prior randomization likely require abdominal surgery within 1 month screen 13 . Concurrent illness , infection disability ( include malignancy neoplastic disease bowel ) may affect interpretation clinical data , otherwise contraindicate participation clinical study ( e.g. , unstable cardiovascular , autoimmune , renal , hepatic , pulmonary , endocrine , metabolic , gastrointestinal , hematologic , psychiatric neurological condition ) .</criteria>
