The patient 's blast cell show expression WT1 transcript , detect quantitative Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase Chain Reaction ( qRTPCR ) .The patient receive follow therapy accord Institution 's standard care . For patient &lt; 60 year old : least two induction chemotherapy treatment . For patient &gt; = 60 year old : least one induction chemotherapy treatment alternative treatment . The first ASCI administration give within one year last chemotherapy administration . All screening procedure complete within seven week first ASCI administration .
