	<brief_title>Effect Enteral Docosahexaenoic Acid Administration Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer often associate malnutrition.The child cancer loss weight , 50-80 % patient cancer experience morbidity mortality result progressive wasting . As consequence malnutrition , patient cancer may poorer outcome , reduce effectiveness chemotherapy increase risk chemotherapy-induced toxicity compare well nourished diagnosis . On hand , recent year , increase focus role long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid effect prevention treatment several disease . The result animal study adult cancer demonstrate consumption long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid slow growth cancer , increase efficacy chemotherapy reduce loss weight side effect chemotherapy . Beneficial effect enteral long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid report adults cancer . However , child cancer scientific report scarce ; therefore , necessary evaluate long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid administration child acute lymphoblastic leukemia effect clinical nutritional outcome previously show different study adult cancer .</detailed_description>
