	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical investigation demonstrate product performance Prometra Programmable Pump System delivery intrathecal Lioresal速 ( baclofen ) management severe spasticity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Intrathecal Baclofen Infusion Chronic Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Prometra Programmable Pump battery-operated , implantable , programmable infusion pump dispense drug solution intrathecal space implant infusion catheter . All function system ( e.g. , dose ) control externally use hand-held , battery-operated programmer . Lioresal Intrathecal ( baclofen ) indicate use management severe spasticity . Spasticity major problem long challenge traditional medical treatment . While incidence spasticity know certainty , likely affect half million people United States 12 million worldwide . Spasticity associate common neurological disorder : multiple sclerosis , stroke , cerebral palsy , spinal cord brain injury . Chronic spasticity seriously restrict normal daily activity reduce quality life many patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The overall goal study choose patient likely experience therapeutic success reduce likelihood risk , complication adverse event . Patients meet follow criterion eligible enrollment study : 1 . Patient history severe chronic spastic hypertonia low extremity last least 6 month : fail respond maximum recommend dos antispasmodic medication include baclofen , experience intolerable CNS side effect effective oral dos 2 . Patient &gt; 21 year age 3 . Patient , legally authorize representative ( LAR ) , provide write informed consent participate study 4 . Investigator considers patient willing able fulfill study requirement 5 . Investigator document attempt eliminate factor contribute increase spasticity ( e.g . infection ) 6 . Patient successful trial Lioresal速 management target spasticity . Patients meet follow criterion exclude study : 1 . Patient MRI spine document structural abnormality prevent adequate CSF flow . ( If patient medical condition contraindicates screen MRI , investigator proceed close appropriate study i.e . CT scan , Xray , rule spinal abnormality would prevent intrathecal drug administration . ) 2 . Patient 's anatomy large enough accommodate pump 's size weight . 3 . Patient systemic infection . 4 . Patient renal insufficiency evidence baseline serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl . 5 . Patient history bleed disorder . 6 . Patient history blood clot deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) within 1 year enrollment . 7 . Patient pregnant breastfeeding , childbearing potential employ effective birth control . 8 . Patient known allergy sensitivity pump system material ( e.g. , silicone rubber , titanium , polyphenylsulfone , acetal resin , polyvinylidene fluoride , tungsten ) . 9 . Patient known allergy Lioresal速 ( baclofen ) , would contraindicate Lioresal速 base drug label . 10 . Patient implantable electronic cardiac device ( i.e . pacemaker , defibrillator , CRT system ) 11 . Patient occupation he/she would expose high current industrial equipment , powerful magnet transmit tower , , electrician , electrical engineer MRI technician . 12 . Patient participate another clinical trial .</criteria>
