	<brief_title>Bi-weekly Cetuximab Combined With 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX-6 ) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For year effective treatment advance colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) limit fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Combination 5-FU 5-FU analog oxaliplatin , antitumor activity single agent , show synergistic activity . Combining oxaliplatin twice monthly folinic acid/5-FU schedule lead improvement first-line treatment advance CRC thus emerge standard regimen first-line therapy metastatic CRC . Cetuximab normally give weekly schedule . As recently show biweekly schedule 500 mg/m² instead weekly standard regimen ( initial dose 400 mg/m² follow 250 mg/m² every week ) exhibit similar pharmacokinetic result comparable efficacy . In order improve convenience patient , study evaluate efficacy safety bi-weekly combination cetuximab FOLFOX . Out various FOLFOX regimens convenient FOLFOX-6 schedule chosen study , test two study combination standard weekly schedule cetuximab . Recent data suggest decrease efficacy cetuximab patient bear k-ras mutation CRC . Therefore patient evidence mutate k-ras gene colorectal carcinoma cell include study .</detailed_description>
