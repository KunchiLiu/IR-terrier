	<detailed_description>The translation evidence-based medicine ( EBM ) clinical practice require train literature search critical appraisal , particularly lack surgery . The demand surgical residency couple 80-hour work week make attendance journal club suboptimal . Internet technology wikis , free user-friendly collaborative website , may solution improve resident participation journal club-related activity , utility highly dependent upon resident contribution usage . We propose pilot randomize trial mandatory versus voluntary participation general surgery journal club wiki verify feasibility , sustainability , impact resident EBM skill measure validated questionnaire . Secondary outcome include resident self-assessment wiki usage comfort EBM skills faculty-assessed resident application skill weekly morbidity mortality conference . If wiki feasible sustainable , project expand include surgical discipline cohort ( i.e . student , fellow , institution , medical discipline ) ensure generalizability . If beneficial , wikis could improve resident EBM skill , also halo effect student faculty , ultimately wikis could improve patient care . The assembled multi-disciplinary multi-institutional team significant collective expertise evidence-based medicine , medical education , library skill , clinical trial design analysis necessary project .</detailed_description>
