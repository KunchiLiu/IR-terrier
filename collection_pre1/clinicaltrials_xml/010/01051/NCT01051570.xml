	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving carboplatin together everolimus prednisone may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give carboplatin together everolimus prednisone work treat patient metastatic prostate cancer progress docetaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin , Everolimus , Prednisone Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Progressed After Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate time progression ( TTP ) achieve carboplatin everolimus patient castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer progress docetaxel-based chemotherapy . Secondary - To evaluate safety regimen . - To assess PSA response rate patient treat regimen . - To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) outcome patient . - To investigate association TTP PSA response rate correlative marker , phospho mTOR , pAKT , p70S6 . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics regimen . - To explore association TTP , OS , circulate tumor tumor cell count . OUTLINE : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 , oral prednisone twice daily day day 1-21 , oral everolimus daily day 2-21 course 1 day 1-21 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor tissue sample collect periodically pharmacodynamic , pharmacokinetic , biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
