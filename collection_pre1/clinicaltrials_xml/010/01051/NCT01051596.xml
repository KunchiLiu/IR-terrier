	<brief_summary>People colorectal cancer cure surgery ask participate study . The purpose study test efficacy ( effectiveness ) new combination drug , ABT-888 temozolomide patient colorectal cancer . Temozolomide act damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) rapidly divide cell , word , cancer cell . ABT-888 inhibits enzyme call `` PARP '' help fix damage DNA . By inhibit enzyme , ABT-888 prevents cancer cell repair damage cause temozolomide , hopefully increase kill cancer cell , decrease tumor body . ABT-888 investigational experimental anti-cancer agent yet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use colorectal cancer . This study help find effect ( good bad ) combination drug , temozolomide ABT-888 colorectal cancer . This research do know ABT-888 increase effectiveness temozolomide colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study ABT-888 Combination With Temozolomide Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We initiate single arm , open label Phase II study test clinical activity ABT-888 temozolomide patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Treatment continue weekly restaging scan perform every 8 week . The trial follow Simon 's two-stage optimal design . For first stage , 21 patient accrue . If two ( 9.5 % ) few 21 patient exhibit partial complete response ABT-888 plus temozolomide , agent reject trial stopped . However , least 3 patient 21 ( 14 % ) exhibit response first stage , additional 29 patient enter second stage , total 50 patient phase II study . If 8 ( 16 % ) patient exhibit response , treatment consider investigation . The sample size 21 50 patient decision rule , stag 1 2 respectively , design differentiate 25 % overall response rate 10 % overall response rate .</detailed_description>
