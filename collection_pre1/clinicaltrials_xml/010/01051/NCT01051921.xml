	<brief_title>Study CTS-1027 Combination With Pegylated Interferon Ribavirin Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Null-Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A subset non-responders standard care treatment ( pegylated interferon ribavrin ) term null responder . Null responder treatment refractory population . Treatment null responder currently limit : retreatment SOC result approximately 5 % sustain virologic response ( SVR ) . CTS-1027 may facilitate activity interferon prevent MMP-induced cleavage deactivation phase clinical response therapy . In addition , CTS-1027 , like ribavirin , alone significantly affect viral replication , CTS-1027 ribavirin likely impact response therapy second slow phase clinical response . The potential MMP inhibition facilitate action interferon , together ribavirin-driven up-regulation interferon stimulate gene , potential yield potent host immune response highly resistant null-responder patient population . Again , since MMP inhibition think target second slow phase kinetics , initial treatment duration trial 24 week . This trial evaluate safety efficacy CTS-1027 combine SOC patient previously respond SOC therapy .</detailed_description>
