	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose temsirolimus give together perifosine see well work treat patient recurrent progressive malignant glioma . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , perifosine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving temsirolimus perifosine may effective treatment malignant glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Perifosine Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) temsirolimus combination perifosine patient recurrent progressive malignant glioma take enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) . ( Phase I ) II . Determine efficacy temsirolimus combination perifosine patient recurrent/progressive glioblastoma ( GBMs ) take EIAEDs measure 6 month progression-free survival ( 6mPFS ) radiographic response rate . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize safety profile perifosine temsirolimus . II . Estimate median overall progression-free survival . III . Explore association pre-treatment molecular phenotype response treatment . IV . Explore molecular effect treatment include phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( AKT ) /mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) /ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6K ) rat sarcoma ( RAS ) /mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) /mitogen-activated protein kinase ( ERK ) signaling , proliferation , apoptosis . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study temsirolimus , follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 perifosine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive temsirolimus perifosine phase I . Some patient may also undergo cytoreductive surgery . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
