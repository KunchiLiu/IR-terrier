	<brief_title>Clinical Values Dose Reduction Techniques Computed Tomography ( CT ) Coronary Artery Imaging With 64-row Multi-Slice Helical CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five hundred patient recruit one half year institution hospital suspect coronary artery disease . All patient give informed consent Institutional Review Board approve study . To obtain relatively consistent image noise , patient limit body height weight 160 cm 175 cm , 55 kg 75 kg , respectively . Patients acute heart failure , severe arrhythmia severe renal dysfunction exclude cardiac study . All patient underwent CT coronary artery scan use 64-row multi-detector CT ( MDCT ) scanner ( Light Speed VCT , GE Healthcare ) supine position . The five hundred patient divided conventional ( C ) low dose ( L ) scan group 250 patient group . The patient distribution term height , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) heart rate similar two group statistically significant difference . Patients give bocker 25-50 mg orally necessary one-hour cardiac scan control heart rate reduce variation . Patient heart rate CT scan 43 81 . A single scout scan shall perform every patient cover whole heart area , 12cm . CT calcification score scan perform every patient CT angiography ( CTA ) accord standard protocol institution . Timing bolus scan perform CTA determine scan start delay time : A total 15 ml contrast agent inject intravenously . Cine scan use monitor contrast enhancement aorta . An ROI place ascend aorta contrast enhancement curve function time measure determine blood circulation time vein elbow aorta . This time use determine optimal scan delay time CTA . The retrospective ECG-gated helical CTA scan perform predetermined scan delay time minimum scan range cover whole heart . 70 ml contrast agent inject 4.5 ml/s injection rate intravenously follow 30ml saline injection rate.Standard scan technique shall use CTA scan C group include : 120kV,640mA,0.35s rotation speed , 0.625 mm slice thickness , body bowtie , 0.20-0.26 pitch select automatically scanner base patient heart rate . For patient L group combination dose reduction technique apply include use application-specific cardiac bowtie , adaptive post-processing filter C2 , ECG mA modulation full tube current 450mA cardiac phase 40-80 % 90mA rest cardiac phase . Cardiac bowtie provide x-rays near center le x-rays towards edge compare typical body bowtie optimize x-ray distribution cardiac application . Our previous study demonstrate advantage image noise reduction heart well overall dose ( CTDI ) reduction . The low tube current selection patient L group shall base previous study indicate noise reduction advantage adaptive post-processing filter C2 might convert use low mA achieve similar image noise high mA clinical application . All image reconstruct standard segment reconstruction algorithm . For L group lower tube current , apply adaptive post-processing filter C2 reduce image noise . Two experienced radiologist quantitatively evaluate image quality blindly term number coronary artery small branch identify , sharpness vessel edge contrast agent clarity vessel use score 1-4 4 high . Score 4 would indicate least 13 coronary artery segment could identify , 3rd branch . Also , identify vessel sharp edge clear delineation contrast agent vessel . If one parameter satisfactory , quality score would 3 2 two parameter good . Image noise measure two set ROI place center ascend aorta place group . CTDI value record group convert effective dose ( ED ) use European DLP method . We shall perform statistical analysis quality score , noise measurement effective dose measurement two set use t-test spss10.0 software .</detailed_description>
