	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate happen biologic mesh body time molecular level . To date , know agent , enzyme , protein interact implantation site contributes mesh remodel and/or degradation . Investigators project identify patient previously place mesh need reoperation site take biopsy mesh normal course surgery . Basic data surround surgical procedure collect . The mesh sample analyze enzymes protein examine histologically process signify remodel and/or degradation . Control patient undergo biopsy abdominal fascia laparoscopic trocar sit manner affect outcome ( ) procedure risk incision site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several biologic mesh develop market use hernia repair soft tissue reconstruction . These biologics include one product derive porcine intestinal submucosa ( SurgisisTM , Cook Medical ) , another derive porcine dermis ( CollaMendTM , C.R . Bard Inc. ) several others derive decellularized human dermis , AlloDermTM ( LifeCell Corp. ) , AlloMaxTM ( C.R . Bard Inc. ) , FlexHDTM ( Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation ) . Although similar concept design , biologic mesh produce distinct , proprietary fashion , different technique use company process storage respective product . Given process step protect industrial intellectual property , rigorous comparison performance mesh difficult . It expect certain method , employ avoid chemical cross-linking ECM protein , would lead significant difference cell migration , biochemical remodel individual mesh . These difference may particular importance scenario laparoscopic ventral hernia repair , mesh place direct apposition parietal peritoneum . In case , biologic remodel take property distensible peritoneum rather strong abdominal wall fascia , could significant impact long-term strength durability hernia repair . A similar situation could also foresee occur esophageal hiatus and/or site intestinal stoma . We feel thus important study remodel process mesh undergo time determine difference product process anatomical position effect mesh incorporation hernia integrity . Many mesh already use human subject , yet certain number patient know suffer hernia recurrence require reoperation removal original mesh prosthesis . It belief biologic explants represent excellent source material study remodel process numerous give time point various anatomic location . We feel also important compare explanted biologic mesh `` control '' tissue , examine successfully biologic mesh mimic native tissue molecular histologic level . To eliminate confound factor , explanted mesh compare biopsy abdominal wall fascia patient undergo non-hernia related surgical procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient undergoing repeat operation repair recurrent hernia revise surgical site previously repair use one aforementioned biologic mesh . Any patient undergoing surgical procedure fascial biopsy would compromise integrity procedure . For subject meet inclusion criterion , population exclude prisoner .</criteria>
