	<detailed_description>Cyclophosphamide widely apply agent treatment systemic lupus erythematosus . As alkylating agent , cyclophosphamide able induce several side effect , include thin hair , loss appetite , nausea , vomit , infection , myelosuppression , etc . However , remarkable variability reaction drug -- incidence side effect outcome treatment -- observe among patient . Cyclophosphamide pro-drug , require enzyme liver transform active chemical arouse alkylating function . And undergoes series detoxification step catalyze specific metabolic enzyme . This study design explore genetic variation among individual key process activation elimination cyclophosphamide order find whether genetic factor associate side effect efficacy . The understanding factor concern drug might imply possible solution minimize incidence side effect patient systemic lupus erythematosus .</detailed_description>
