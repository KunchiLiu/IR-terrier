	<brief_summary>Nosocomial infection become major health problem . They induce important use antibiotic preponderant factor development bacterial resistance . The multi-resistance antibiotic affect primarily Gram-negative bacteria . Some strain ( Acinetobacter Pseudomonas ) become resistant almost antibiotic currently available , use old molecule Colistin may alternative . However , reliable data Colistin PK characteristic . These data essential optimize administration . The aim present study evaluate pharmacokinetics Colistin prodrug , colistimethate ( CMS ) intravenous administration Colistimethate alone combine inhaled Colistin severely ill patient infect multiresistant gram-negative bacteria</brief_summary>
