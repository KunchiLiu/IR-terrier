	<brief_summary>We hypothesize human malignancy harbour subpopulation tumor initiate cells/cancer stem cell ( CSCs ) drive tumor development potentially recurrence metastasis disease . The primary aim study develop strategy prospective isolation/enrichment CSCs human tumor different tissue origin . In addition , characterize signal pathway and/or tumor specific antigen specific CSCs , order specifically target CSCs endpoint study .</brief_summary>
