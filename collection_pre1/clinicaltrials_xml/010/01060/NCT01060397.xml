	<brief_summary>Heavy alcohol consumption lead various health problem recognise important public health problem . This evidence huge medium attention recently focus use misuse alcohol , particularly young patient . At least 1 20 population UK physically psychologically dependent alcohol . This consequences physical psychological well-being patient , adverse consequence family , work life society general . Current treatment mostly deliver specialist unit , number meaning patient get access service . This lead vicious cycle result multiple hospital admission , ineffective treatment continual drinking . It therefore vital investigator develop alternative effective treatment patient interrupt vicious cycle . In patient drink heavily , yet alcohol-dependent , treatment call brief intervention help reduce overall alcohol consumption , improve health wellbeing . However , whether similar intervention help alcohol-dependent patient yet establish . In study , investigator aim identify , treat support alcohol-dependent individual . Using enhanced form BI ( term extend brief intervention , EBI ) basis clinical care , investigator undertake randomise trial compare EBI usual clinical care . The investigator use various clinical behavioural measure assess effectiveness treatment . The investigator also ask patient felt , think treatment professional deliver treatment . If EBI show effective costly , could provide national framework treatment alcohol-dependent patient . This could potentially improve opportunity access treatment choice treatment available patient . The investigator hypothesis Extended Brief Interventions ( EBI ) deliver alcohol-dependent patient hospital set Alcohol Specialist Nurse ( ASN ) effective reduce overall alcohol consumption improve standard measure alcohol dependence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Controlled Trial Extended Brief Interventions Alcohol Dependent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Extended Brief Interventions ( EBI ) deliver alcohol-dependent patient hospital set Alcohol Specialist Nurse ( ASN ) effective compare usual care ; reduce overall alcohol consumption improve standard measure alcohol dependence . Overall aim To test clinical cost effectiveness extend brief intervention individual alcohol dependence acute hospital setting . Objectives : 1 . Determine whether brief intervention reduce overall alcohol consumption . 2 . Determine whether brief intervention effective treatment alcohol dependence . 3 . Determine whether brief intervention reduce length stay hospital 4 . Determine patient feel approach opportunistic manner screen alcohol-related problem subsequently ask part research trial ( Refer Part B protocol . Qualitative analysis patient view experience ) . 5 . Determine cost effectiveness brief intervention alcohol dependence . ( Part C. Cost effectiveness analysis ) Part A . Clinical Intervention Methods Design Randomized Controlled Trial Outcome measure Primary â€¢ Severity Alcohol dependence ( SADQ ) Secondary - Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) - Measure Dependence ( Leeds Dependency Questionnaire ) [ 24 ] - Quantity frequency alcohol consumption UK unit per drinking day . - Readiness Change Questionnaire ( RTCQ ) - Number ED attendances 6 month pre 6 month post treatment/control . - Hospital length stay sum day hospital 6 month 6 month post treatment/control . - Number hospital admission 6 month pre 6 month post treatment/control . - Length stay initial treatment day . - Biochemical indicator co-morbid condition . Gamma-glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) , Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) , available . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Patients score equal great 16 AUDIT screen tool . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Patient 's know intravenous drug abuser . 2 . Patients unable give inform consent . 3 . Patients whose medical co-morbidity require frequent long term hospital admission . These include patient are/have ; 1 . Comatose /unconscious 2 . End Stage Chronic Liver Disease 3 . Dementia 4 . Congestive Cardiac Failure stage III IV 5 . Acute Pancreatitis 6 . Head Injury abnormality CT scan 7 . Cerebral Vascular Accident ( CVA ) 8 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) 9 . Other chronic condition admission 1 month require . 4 . Patients know pregnant 5 . Patient 's presently recruit research trial 6 . Patients currently recently ( last 6 month ) engage structured alcohol treatment Setting Southport Ormskirk district general hospital . This acute NHS Hospital Trust Emergency department ( ED ) base within North West region England currently input available patient alcohol-related admission attendance . Sample Size Based previous study dependent drinker receive intervention ASN , expect 55 % patient display fall SADQ score baseline 12 week ' follow . Another confounder area research phenomenon natural recovery ( NR ) . The natural recovery rate time period expect control group expect 25 % ( literature range 12 % treatment population [ 20 ] 35 % within general lifetime population [ 22 , 23 ] ) . In order detect difference group ( 55 % vs. 25 % ) 90 % power 5 % significance level , approximately 65 patient require group . In order allow estimate 50 % drop rate ( observe previous study similar patient ) , 130 patient recruit per group . It estimate least 5 eligible patient recruit per week , thus target achieve within 12 month recruitment period . Statistical Analysis A full statistical analysis plan write prior conduct comparative analysis treatment arm . The primary analysis intention treat compare two group patient term primary outcome . Test score summarise use descriptive statistic , mean 95 % confidence interval ( median inter-quartile range non-normally distribute ) baseline , 12 week 6 month . Change baseline 12 week 6 month post treatment present . The hypothesis difference two treatment arm 12 week 6 month ( separate analysis ) test use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , control baseline measurement . A p-value 0.05 ( 5 % level ) use declare statistical significance 95 % confidence interval estimate effect report . Time treatment interaction assess . The assumption make use ANCOVA assess . All longitudinal data collect used secondary analysis , result increase power . A formal test treatment-covariate interaction conduct . Exploratory analysis conduct impact treatment effect factor gender . As much information possible collect reason miss outcome data use inform imputation approach employ analysis . Recruitment Process Patients refer healthcare professional Southport NHS Trust ; ASN also visit Emergency Department Medical Assessment Unit daily identify case . The nurse take consent patient discus patient name nurse agree patient physically mentally fit give consent study . If patient give consent , undergo full alcohol history assessment . Those patient wish take part study , unwilling consent randomisation give usual clinical care , may ask consider consent Part B study . ( refer Part B protocol ) Consecutive patient screen alcohol misuse attendance ED department Southport Hospital , identification alcohol-related problem clinician refer ASN assessment . Consent All eligible patient give relevant verbal write information research ask consent . Due opportunist nature design study patient ask consent initial assessment . This ensure population recruit representative clinical population attend ED either aware unaware role alcohol presentation . Patients able withdraw study point . If reason opt volunteered patient ask consent use information . Randomization Procedure On consent patient randomize either intervention control group . Patients randomize use sequentially number opaque seal envelope prepared accord computer-generated randomisation allocation sequence . Blocked randomisation use randomly vary block size ( prepared use Stata version 8.2 ) ensure equal number patient recruit group . Randomisation service provide independent statistician Centre Medical Statistics Health Evaluation , University Liverpool , trial run Southport General Hospital . Process Following consent , research nurse complete screen diagnostic tool ; ) Severity Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire ( SADQ ) , b ) Leeds Dependency Questionnaire c ) Readiness Change Questionnaire ( RTCQ ) , ) EuroQoL EQ-5D . The patient randomized treatment group research nurse . Group 1 . Treatment Group Patients receive initial assessment EBI ASN . The Intervention deliver utilising FRAMES approach [ 11 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The important element model exploration patient ' perception link alcohol consumption presentation . A maximum six treatment session , last 20 minute , take place within 12 week treatment period ( 2 hour total ) . Follow-up visit schedule 12 week 6 month follow recruitment study , perform outpatient department , home telephone . The assessor blind treatment allocation . Patients differ whether complete pharmacological detoxification opt alcohol reduction strategy utilising tool drink diary . For patient undergo pharmacological detoxification abstinence essential non-negotiable . Within FRAMES model patient choice treatment mode aim . Patients offer up-to 6 intervention . Assessment brief intervention take place occasion , however biochemical assessment take place clinical necessity ( example change clinical condition indicate ) . Group 2 . Control Group The control group receive assessment intervention group receive EBI . They receive normal clinical care , may may include referral specialist alcohol service . Follow visit arrange 12 week 6 month follow recruitment study , either outpatient , home telephone . The assessor blind treatment allocation . Data Management Data collect prospectively time point specify ; 1 . Baseline 2 . 12 week treatment finish 3 . 6 month follow Data Case Report Form ( CRF ) carry anonymised number , enter directly Microsoft access database hold password protect networked computer Southport General Hospital . Patient information keep patient log , remain locked filing cabinet clinical room Southport General Hospital alongside anonymised case report file . Follow Up Strategy 1 . A 48 % failure attend follow include power calculation account drop-out rate . 2 . An intention treat analysis perform data 3 . Care take take address phone detail patient another contact person . 4 . Consent seek contact patient General Practitioner ( GP ) form contact . Therefore GP detail phone number take . 5 . Patients offer range follow-up option either hospital , telephone , home . 6 . 2 week follow due patient contact nurse trial co-ordinator see attend appointment would prefer appointment take place . 7 . The day appointment contact reminder follow-up appointment next day . 8 . If patient unable contact sent letter ask contact team order arrange follow-up . 9 . If patient unable contact via telephone fail respond letter 6 month follow-up appointment , research nurse visit patient home determine ) patient still reside address , b ) patient still willing undertake follow-up appointment . 10 . If patient contact team stage , say lose follow-up . Data Protection accordance Southport Ormskirk policy data governance . Ethical Consideration Each group receive normal clinical care respective group . No patient group disadvantage clinical care patient varies , know effective treatment . Part B . Patient Satisfaction Service Aims This part research design capture patient 's experience . It adopt qualitative design focus gain patient 's view three main feature study ; ) screen alcohol-related problem , b ) invite take part treatment programme , c ) subsequent participation RCT . For group , consent interview take place initial assessment , group give semi structured questionnaire . Group 2 3 patient , also undergo face face interview . Group 3 patient , interviewed end intervention phase . Methods Design Qualitative semi-structured questionnaire in-depth face face interview . The purpose part research provide in-depth analysis view patient approach take part study . The study therefore use qualitative interview provide deep , contextualised understanding patient 's experience take part study particularly opportunistic nature drinking assess participation RCT . Data collect use two method . 1 ) Semi structure questionnaire . 2 ) In-depth interview utilise Topic Guide . The topic guide design elicit information following : - The experience opportunistic nature screening . - The experience offer receive brief intervention . - The experience identify alcohol dependent without include intervention arm study . All patient require sign inform consent prior interview . Inclusion Criteria The three sample group define ; - Group 1 . Eligible intervention consent RCT . - Group 2 . Eligible intervention consent RCT randomise control . - Group 3 . Eligible intervention consent RCT randomise intervention . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Patient 's know intravenous drug abuser . 2 . Patients unable give inform consent . 3 . Patients whose medical co-morbidity require frequent long term hospital admission . These include patient are/have 1 . Comatose /unconscious 2 . End Stage Chronic Liver Disease 3 . Dementia 4 . Congestive Cardiac Failure stage III IV 5 . Acute Pancreatitis 6 . Head Injury abnormality CT scan 7 . Cerebral Vascular Accident ( CVA ) 8 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) 9 . Other chronic condition admission 1 month require . 4 . Patients know pregnant 5 . Patient 's presently recruit research trial Sample Size It estimate approximately 10 patient group sufficient reach thematic saturation describe Morse Recruitment Process ( See flow diagram Fig 4 ) The ASN ask patient irrespective study involvement whether willing speak qualitative researcher . If patient willing patient see researcher follow clinical intervention . The qualitative researcher determine patient group part study . Group 1 . Eligible intervention consent RCT . Patients ask complete PEQ . Those complete PEQ ask consent face face interview . At time place convenient patient QR conduct face face interview . Group 2 . Eligible intervention consent RCT randomise control . The QR obtain informed write consent conduct interview . At time place convenient patient , soon possible consent study give , QR conduct face face interview . Group 3 . Eligible intervention consent RCT randomise intervention . The QR obtain informed write consent conduct interview . At time place convenient patient , soon possible treatment complete , QR conduct face face interview . Analysis The identification theme pattern interview data , use technique constant comparative deviant case analysis predominant method organize , cod categorize data . While constant comparative method associate principle ground theory , comparison represent central analytic process inductive qualitative analysis seek derive concept data . In analysis researcher interested 'negative ' , 'deviant ' 'anomalous ' evidence identification pattern response . In sort analysis divergence provide important way inform modify emergent conceptualisation explanation . Where necessary , NVivo , computer assist qualitative data analysis software store retrieve data use . Essentially NVivo software enable data interview transcript directly import Word file NVivo rich text file cod accord description meaning 'nodes . Part C. Economic Evaluation Outcome measure Primary - Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) - Severity Alcohol dependence ( SADQ ) - EQ-5D Secondary - Number ED attendances 6 month pre 6 month post treatment/control . - Hospital length stay sum day hospital 6 month 6 month post treatment/control . - Number hospital admission 6 month pre 6 month post treatment/control . - Length stay initial treatment day . An economic evaluation EBI perform . The major part simple comparison cost two arm , measure cost provide service difference NHS cost two arm might occur result decrease use service , e.g . hospital re-attendances , accident , GP visit etc regardless relationship abuse alcohol . Data collect patient GP record . The perspective limit NHS . The time frame six month follow-up time study . The cost intervention identify study . The cost use NHS service ( ED GP attendances cost per bed day inpatient ) take standard NHS cost publish University Kent . The total cost NHS care patient base cost amount service utilisation data collect outline . It may necessary adjust analysis difference baseline SADQ co-morbidities . A separate analysis NHS cost specifically alcohol relate service need undertaken : although might anticipate NHS cost fall intervention arm , assume point fall NHS service use may see alcohol relate area , especially in-patients severe co-morbidities . Whether particular NHS intervention relate alcohol cause require judgment , make two clinical assessor blind patient allocation . Conversely , fall total cost might due play chance result decrease non-alcohol related morbidity relatively short time frame study . If cost ( especially total cost also alcohol related cost , provide non alcohol relate cost equal ) intervention arm less non-intervention arm , economic case intervention make . If cost intervention arm great non-intervention arm , necessary undertake cost effectiveness study , time frame perspective .</detailed_description>
