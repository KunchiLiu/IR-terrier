	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study Valproic Acid Single-dose Paliperidone Extended-Release ( ER ) Healthy Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( patient know identity study drug take ) study healthy volunteer ( healthy men ask participate study ) . The primary purpose study determine paliperidone ( schizophrenia medication ) divalproex sodium ( epilepsy medication also refer valproic acid [ VPA ] ) interact affect absorption , distribution , metabolism , elimination body . Other purpose study learn safety two study drug take together learn healthy volunteer tolerate two drug take together . Approximately 24 healthy men ( refer healthy volunteer ) take part study . The study last 40 day consist screening period begin 21 day first study drug administration follow open label treatment period last approximately 20 day ( Day -1 Day 19 ) . The purpose screening visit see healthy volunteer meet requirement participate study . During screen period may require one visit study clinic , follow procedure perform : 1 ) sign informed consent obtain healthy volunteer document agree participate study , 2 ) medical history demographic information include age , date birth , sex , race , etc collect , 3 ) physical examination perform , 4 ) vital sign ( pulse rate , blood pressure , temperature ) measure , 5 ) blood sample collect routine laboratory test well test hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , 6 ) urine sample collect routine laboratory test include test drug abuse alcohol . Healthy volunteer meet entry criterion enrollment screen ask check study clinic evening first administration study drug ( Day -1 ) stay overnight clinic Day 19 . During 20 day study clinic , healthy volunteer ask refrain consumption food beverage contain alcohol , grapefruit juice , Seville oranges , quinine ( tonic water ) , use caffeine/xanthine-containing product ( coffee , tea , chocolate , cola , soda caffeine ) , food contain poppy seed . Healthy volunteer also ask refrain jogging , strenuous exercise type , sunbathe confine study center 48 hour admission study center . Healthy volunteer provide standard meal 20 day confinement study center may smoke throughout study limit 10 cigarette 2 cigar , 2 pipe tobacco per day . If healthy volunteer illness fever within 2 day schedule dose study drug , dose study drug postpone body temperature normal least 72 hour ( 3 day ) . All healthy volunteer take study drug orally ( mouth ) follow order day specify : 1 extend release ( ER ) tablet 12 mg paliperidone Day 1 follow two 500-mg ER tablet divalproex sodium daily Day 5 18 , 1 tablet 12 mg paliperidone ER Day 15 . Paliperidone ER tablets take healthy volunteer overnight fast ( nothing eat drink except water ) least 10 hour . Divalproex sodium ER tablets take time 1 hour 1 hour meal ( except Days 14 15 ) ; morning dose Days 14 15 administer 10 hour fast . All study drug tablet swallow whole glass water ( tablet must chew , divide , dissolve , crush ) . The shell paliperidone ER tablet non-disintegrating may leave body intact . Therefore , healthy volunteer may see shell tablet stool reason alarm . During study , healthy volunteer blood sample take vein arm use needle . Each blood sample consist approximately 1 teaspoonful blood . Over course study total 53 blood sample collect total 9 ounce little cup blood . The blood sample use evaluate primary outcome measure study pharmacokinetics ( blood level ) single dose orally administer paliperidone ER administration VPA steady-state ( steady state achieve rate drug absorption equal drug elimination drug concentration blood stable ) . Healthy volunteer also monitor safety throughout study . Safety assessment include monitor adverse event ( side effect ) finding clinical laboratory test ( include hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) ( ECGs use trace electrical activity heart ) , vital sign measurement , physical examination . A review concomitant medications/therapies take healthy volunteer study also perform . Healthy volunteer complete study final blood sample collect Day 19 . Before leave study center , end study procedure perform include physical examination , vital sign measurement , routine clinical laboratory test , ECG . All healthy volunteer receive single oral ( mouth ) dose one 12 mg paliperidone extend release ( ER ) tablet Day 1 follow two 500-mg divalproex sodium ER tablet ( tablet equivalent 500 mg valproic acid ) oral administration daily Day 5 18 single oral dose one 12 mg paliperidone ER tablet Day 15 . All drug swallow 240 mL noncarbonated water must swallow whole , chew , divide , dissolve , crush .</detailed_description>
