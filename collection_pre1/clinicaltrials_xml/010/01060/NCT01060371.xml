	<brief_summary>Spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) genetic neurological disease cause imbalance , poor coordination , speech difficulty . There different kind SCA study focus type 1 , 2,3 , 6 ( SCA 1 , SCA 2 , SCA 3 , also know Machado-Joseph disease SCA 6 ) . The disease rare , slowly progressive , cause increasingly severe neurological difficulty variable across within genotype . The purpose research study bring together group expert field SCA purpose learn disease . The research question : 1 . How disease progress time ? 2 . What best way measure progression ? 3 . Do gene , gene abnormal disease , effect way disease behave ? This nationwide study expect 800 patient participate USA . The participant study indeterminate period time . Study visit do every 6 12 month depend participate site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If decide participate study , collect 1 tablespoon ( 15 milliliter ) blood first/screening visit order extract DNA . The sample send research laboratory Dr Stefan Pulst University Utah study genetic factor modify course disease . As part study , would like put blood tissue repository . Submission sample repository may give scientist valuable research material help develop new diagnostic test , new treatment , new way prevent disease . Scientists use sample , material isolate , commercial product service . Your blood keep Dr. Stefan Pulst . Your sample name personal information link . Your sample may share researcher University Utah institution . The information keep sample age , disease , age onset disease duration disease . The principal investigator site person link sample . You sample remove bank later write request PI . You participate genetic modifier study tissue repository remain part study . You also ask complete several assessment include questionnaire , motor function test , neurological exam physical exam .</detailed_description>
