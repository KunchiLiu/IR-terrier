	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare diagnostic accuracy Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT ) versus Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CEMRI ) determine size breast cancer preoperatively . Secondary objective include : 1 . Comparing operate characteristic combine image protocol respect reference standard , i.e . histopathologic assessment , additional non-index lesion . 2 . Comparison re-excision rate base estimated disease extent adjunctive CEMRI vs. adjunctive DBT . 3 . Evaluation patient satisfaction regard adjunctive modality ( DBT vs. CEMRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OVERVIEW Subjects enrol within 4 week date diagnosis biopsy proven ductal carcinoma in-situ ( DCIS ) Invasive Breast Cancer . Approximately 50 subject enrol . In addition Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center 's ( DHMC ) current standard imaging practice , i.e . bilateral mammography without sonography bilateral CEMRI , subject undergo bilateral DBT within four week CEMRI prior surgical treatment . Usual clinical practice , i.e . interpretation current standard imaging ( Mammography , Sonography CEMRI ) , clinical assessment base physical exam well , discussion patient breast surgeon record , dictate local treatment , i.e . surgical excision , breast conservation therapy ( BCT ) mastectomy . Any routine diagnostic examination complete part subject 's standard care image read interpret part patient 's standard care . There delay read interpretation routine care image . Blinded read DBT CEMRI image conduct , patient 's mammography +/- sonography available reference . The interpreting radiologist ( `` reader '' ) evaluate tumor size extent disease , along presence absence multi-focality contralateral disease . The two image paradigm compare estimation breast cancer extent use gold-standard histologic result . DBT mammography may provide new different information index lesion standard imaging , alter clinical management . However , DBT detect additional abnormality separate index lesion either ipsilateral contralateral breast , evaluate standard image technology ( e.g . diagnostic mammography sonography ) target site assess level suspicion malignancy potential need biopsy . PROCEDURES Tomosynthesis Acquisition Study participant show DCIS invasive breast cancer fine needle aspiration cytology and/or core needle biopsy , sign informed consent , undergo bilateral DBT mammogram within 4 week CEMRI ( prior surgical treatment ) . The DBT mammogram include 2D acquisition 3D acquisition , compression standard craniocaudal ( CC ) mediolateral ( MLO ) projection . In rare instance index malignancy include view due chest wall location , single repeat view involve ( i.e . cancerous ) breast perform attempt image malignancy combine DBT mammogram . For view , subject position compressed standard mammographic imaging . The patient remain compression 15 second . During compression , 3D dataset ( 4 second exposure ) 2D dataset ( 2 second exposure ) acquire . Once subject position compress , technologist activate motion x-ray tube move start position -7.5 degree . The technologist start tomosynthesis 3D acquisition , complete +7.5 degree ( arc 15 degree ) . The x-ray tube design move back center automatically acquire 2D dataset . At conclusion image acquisition , compression automatically release . A Radiologic Technologist register radiography mammography perform tomosynthesis study . The technologist perform DBT exam train use operation DBT imaging system . Device Description A DBT system similar commercially available product ( 'Selenia Dimensions ' , Hologic , Inc. , Danbury CT ) use data collection . The 'Selenia Dimensions ' 2D/3D digital mammography system approve FDA screen diagnostic breast imaging . The breast tomosynthesis system digital mammography system ( Hologic , Inc , Danbury , CT ) capable produce standard two-dimensional image three-dimensional tomosynthesis mammogram . The 2D 3D tomographic datasets acquire compression . The breast tomosynthesis system employ tungsten target anode interchangeable rhodium , silver , aluminum x-ray filter . The filtration material chosen base breast thickness exam protocol , along tungsten target , minimize x-ray dose maximize image content . The three-dimensional tomosynthesis x-ray image technology involve acquire image stationary compress breast , multiple angle short-scan . The individual image reconstruct series thin high-resolution slice display individually dynamic cine mode . When combination mode , system acquire 3D dataset 2D standard mammographic image . The dose single combination 2D/3D acquisition `` average breast '' i.e . compress breast thickness 4.5 cm , 50 % fat , 50 % glandular composition approximately 2.45 mGy , less FDA limit single mammogram image ( 3 mGy ) breast thickness composition . The DBT system use subject sign Informed Consent . Quality Control The Hologic Tomosynthesis Digital Mammography System ( DBT ) check qualified medical physicist prior test image subject assure system operate correctly optimum image quality . A Study Technologist review image , obtain phantom image check system operation periodic basis assure optimum image quality maintain . The quality control procedures describe system ' operator manual use throughout trial . If noticeable degradation image quality , Hologic engineer call immediately recalibrate repair system . CEMRI Each subject undergo bilateral CEMRI part usual clinical practice , participation study . Subjects unable undergo contrast enhance MRI due contraindication MRI gadolinium base intravenous contrast eligible study enrollment . Image Interpretation The DBT image evaluate Mammography Quality Standards Act certify radiologist . There two reader subject : one reader interpret DBT ( blind result CEMRI ) , second reader interpret CEMRI ( blind result DBT ) . Each reader interpret adjunct exam ( i.e . DBT CEMRI ) unblinded conventional imaging ( i.e . mammography +/- sonography ) complete appropriate rating instrument . Size Determination Study Readers estimate maximal plane diameter least two image plane index malignant lesion . For DBT , maximal diameter measure CC MLO projection . For CEMRI , maximal diameter measure axial sagittal projection . Readers also report diagram location additional lesion consider definitely benign . Histological Interpretation The specimen ( lumpectomy mastectomy ) sequentially section 5 mm slice number slice record gross description . Targeted section take lumpectomy mastectomy sample lesion identify imaging ( per usual clinical protocol ) . Such lesion submit appropriate along 1-2 section surround cuff normal appear parenchyma appropriate direction . The distance multiple lesion measure , case single section intervene tissue submit histologic examination . Incidental lesion identify gross exam sample appropriate . The histopathologic specimen view pathologist 3-20 year experience breast pathology . Invasive disease grade accord Nottingham Bloom Scarff Richardson system . DCIS grade accord modify Van Nuys system , include nuclear grade , presence absence necrosis , pattern growth . The number consecutive slide contain DCIS multiply approximate thickness tissue section ( 5mm ) order determine histopathologic size . Tumor size determine gross examination pathology specimen visible gross examination . Tumor size estimate case reflect aggregate invasive non-invasive , i.e . DCIS , component . If gross lesion see , measurement tumor size determine microscopic measurement lesion . Since 2 component intermingle , size report represent aggregate size . In addition gross exam measurement , lesion substantially compose DCIS , ( i.e . extensive intraductal component present ) microscopic examination , specify size invasive component ( microscopic exam ) well measurement DCIS component ( microscopic exam ) provide aggregate size invasive DCIS component ) . In case invasive cancer extensive component DCIS treat mastectomy wide local excision , standard pathologic sample lesion may allow accurate microscopic size estimate lesion . In select case pathologist indicate type growth pattern DCIS component either `` mass-like '' `` non mass-like '' .</detailed_description>
