	<brief_title>Five Fractions Radiotherapy Followed Full Dose FOLFOX Chemotherapy Preoperative Treatment Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our principal objective trial determine short course radiotherapy follow chemotherapy maintain morbidity level report concurrent 5FU ( oral capecitabine 5FU unavailable ) , oxaliplatin , radiotherapy , maintain response rate comparable would expect radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy . If establish T stage downstaging rate significantly well 50 % acute tolerance acceptable , would consider study provide sufficient pilot data support include approach arm multi-institution phase III trial . The long-term goal improve overall control disease deliver good chemotherapy earlier .</detailed_description>
