	<criteria>Male female patient 18 year old . Patients diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism ( clinical symptom and/or biochemical disturbance ) schedule parathyroidectomy . One diseased parathyroid gland , visualize ultrasonography . The diseased target parathyroid gland accessible HIFU treatment ( anonymised ultrasonographic image send sponsor 's technical team validation ) . Normal pretreatment nasofibroscopy . Voluntary sign informed consent . Inaccessibility high risk target neighbouring structure , evidence : Targeted area locate less 2 mm laterally oesophagus carotid artery Targeted area locate less 3 mm laterally trachea , Significant hyperechoic area posterior shadow locate less 10 mm behind targeted area ( behind understood posterior target area direction HIFU beam ) Investigator appreciation abnormal blood test could contraindicate treatment HIFU ( bleed abnormality ) Known spondylitis neck vertebrae Head and/or neck disease prevent hyperextension neck . Known history parathyroid neoplasias neck region . History neck irradiation Patients whose concurrent illness , disability , geographical residence would hamper attendance require study visit Pregnant lactate woman . Female patient childbearing age suitable contraception method .
