	<brief_title>MRI ( Including Spectroscopy Fat-Saturations Diffusion-Weighted Imaging ) Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At institution , patient receive external beam and/or brachytherapy part treatment primary cervical cancer receive CT , PET , MRI simulation scan standard care . Brachytherapy patient also receive weekly T1/T2 weight MR simulation scan part treatment planning . We propose use additional MR sequence standard T1/T2 weight MR simulation scan . The data obtain additional sequence use improve tumor delineation obtain prognostic information .</detailed_description>
