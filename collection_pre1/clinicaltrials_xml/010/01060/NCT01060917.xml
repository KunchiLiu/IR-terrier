	<brief_title>Glucose Clamp Study Prove Hypo- Hyperglycemic Episodes Using Non-invasive Glucose Monitoring Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A completely non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring device consider major target glucose sensor development . The aim study evaluate performance non-invasive glucose sensor ( wristwatch ) control condition ( glucose clamp ) hyperglycemia ( study day 1 ) hypoglycemia ( study day 2 ) . Measurements non-invasive glucose monitoring device compare obtain minimally invasive glucose monitoring device ( GlucoDay , microdialysis principle ) . In addition , change blood electrolyte concentration well impact measurement non-invasive glucose sensor evaluate .</detailed_description>
