	<brief_summary>Almost 50 % hypertensive patient remain uncontrolled . Clinical decision mostly base office blood pressure , despite fallacy method measurement . Other reason achieve blood pressure target lack 24-hr efficacy tolerability exist anti-hypertensive drug class . Aliskiren ( Rasilez® ) new antihypertensive drug , give day . The purpose REALITY study- [ tREAtment essentiaL hypertension rasIlez . evaluation different method blood pressure measurement - efficacy safeTY evaluation - ] evaluate efficacy , tolerability aliskiren `` real life '' set . The efficacy drug evaluate use 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) . Results compare office , nurse self blood pressure monitoring . This comparison allow decide follow-up technique well hypertensive patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre observational uncontrolled prospective study , Hypertensive patient either treatment naïve uncontrolled current monotherapy meet inclusion exclusion criterion , assign Rasilez treatment ( start 2 week 150 mg well tolerated dosage increase 300 mg ) . The treatment continue additional 10 week . Rasilez administrate monotherapy add antihypertensive ( patient currently single medication ) . The patient additional visit week 6 , week 12 For eligible patient 24 h ABPM test perform week prior visit 2 ( treatment initiation ) week prior final visit . Each patient receive automatic blood pressure monitor [ OMRON MX3 plus ] SBPM measurement , The monitor provide sponsor whole study period . The patient train blood pressure measurement . SBPM perform twice week [ morning even ] Nurse blood pressure measurement perform visit , 10 minute rest , prior medical visit . Office blood pressure perform physician visit Blood sample electrolytes , renal function , liver function hematology , take base line visit , week 2 week 12 Other antihypertensive add time study , accord decision investigator , except ACE inhibitor ARBs . AEs report appropriate site CRF page . In case discontinuation aliskiren interruption aliskiren treatment reason give . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) document additionally separate SAE form report within 24h NOVARTIS Pharma , Drug safety department Adherence treatment evaluate use standard formula . Estimated time recruitment 50 patient : One year . Study design scheme Visit 1 - [ week -2 ] physician nurse BP . Sign inform consent- command ABPM week prior visit 2 - SBPM training Visit 2 [ week 0 ] physician nurse BP . Start Rasilez 150 mg command laboratory exams prior next visit . Visit 3 [ week 2 ] physician nurse BP . Titrate Rasilez 300 mg Visit 4 ( week 6 ) . physician nurse BP . ABPM command lab exam ( week prior visit 5 ) Visit 5 ( 12 week ) physician nurse BP SBPM data collect visit 2,3,4 5 . Efficacy define term therapeutic goal express target blood pressure accord WHO ESH [ SBPM ABPM ] criterion : Office Blood Pressure : Diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≤ 90 mmHg Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≤ 140 mmHg non-diabetics DBP≤ 80 mmHg SBP≤ 130 mmHg diabetic , respectively . SBPM : DBP ≤ 85 mmHg SBP ≤ 135 mmHg 24 h ABPM : DBP≤ 130/80 mmHg SBP≤ 130 mmHg , Awake DBP ≤ 85 mmHg , Awake SBP ≤ 135 mmHg Asleep DBP ≤70 mmHg , asleep SBP ≤ 70 mmHg . Effectiveness Safety also evaluate take consideration patient compliance Safety assessment : Safety assess mean ( S ) AE reporting .</detailed_description>
