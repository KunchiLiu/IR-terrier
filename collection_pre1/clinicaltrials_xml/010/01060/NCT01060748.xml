	<brief_summary>This research study experimental ( investigational ) vaccine call ACE527 . ACE527 vaccine make prevent disease germ call enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) . This germ cause diarrhea , largely child live develop country traveler country . One purpose study see vaccine safe develop immune response . Another purpose see prevents people get sick expose ETEC germ . This ETEC germ also experimental ( investigational ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Vaccine Against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli ( ETEC ) Prevent Moderate Severe Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , double-blind , placebo-controlled , Phase II vaccination challenge study design assess protective efficacy ACE 527 vaccine , well collect expand safety immunogenicity data . The study carry two phase . In initial vaccination phase , 72 subject randomize 1:1 receive either ACE527 placebo outpatient basis . Vaccine placebo preparation give orally . Following vaccination , subject follow out-patients safety use diary card surveillance , vaccine shed qualitative stool culture ( i.e . presence absence ) development local systemic antibody responses ACE527 vaccine strain . In subsequent inpatient challenge phase , 56 vaccinated subject admit inpatient challenge ETEC strain , H10407 . The challenge dose administer orally.After challenge , subject monitor diarrhea signs/symptoms enteric illness daily medical check , vital sign determination , grade weigh stool . Monitoring fecal shed challenge ETEC strain H10407 occur daily , challenge , in-patient . Local systemic antibody response challenge ETEC strain H10407 also assess . All subject treat Abx .</detailed_description>
