	<detailed_description>- Evaluation Criteria And Analysis Method : 1 . Efficacy - Evaluate total 3 time : 2 , 4 12 week last injection . In efficacy evaluation data , difference WSRS improvement ratio , normality test ratio use , evaluation variable , statistical hypothesis test conduct use t-test , Wilcoxon rank-sum test , Chi-square test , ANOVA repeatedly measure data accord nature data . 1 . Wrinkle Severity Rating System - It range 1 point ( absent ) 5 point ( extreme ) , WSRS score compare baseline ( pre-injection period ) every visit . 2 . Evaluation subject 's improvement - It range 1 point ( bad ) 5 point ( much improve ) . A degree improvement subject decide upon every visit evaluate , compare screening period ( baseline ) . 3 . Evaluation investigator 's improvement - It range 1 point ( bad ) 5 point ( much improve ) . A degree improvement investigator decide upon every visit evaluate , compare screening period ( baseline ) . 2 . Safety The analysis safety evaluation data conduct descriptive statistic use causal relationship outbreak frequency device . 1 . Subjective adverse event : Uncomfortable sense TheraFill® injection 2 . Objective adverse event : Investigator shall observe evaluate adverse event edema , redness , tenderness , pain , bruise , itching , nodule others inject site injection - Evidence : 1 .
