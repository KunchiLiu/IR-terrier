	<brief_summary>Tinnitus occurrence auditory sensation without presence acoustic stimulus . Approximately , 50 million people United States experience chronic tinnitus 15 million people bothersome tinnitus . Several study show people bother tinnitus difficulty concentration focus . Through image modality derange neural network responsible attention . Only 20 percent patient diagnose tinnitus severely bother . We seek follow : 1 . Match group non-bothered tinnitus patient age hearing status exist cohort bother tinnitus patient . 2 . Assess resting-state neural connectivity patient non-bothersome tinnitus . Findings comparison functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging ( fcMRI ) subject bothersome tinnitus current rTMS clinical trial normal age-matched control without tinnitus demonstrate subject bothersome tinnitus dramatic alteration cortical attention control network . Our hypothesis fcMRI-defined change attention control network reflect impact excessive auditory stimulation patient bothersome tinnitus explains difficulty concentration , short-term memory , common problem . To fully test hypothesis need obtain fcMRI attention network among subject tinnitus without bother compare status neural network tinnitus subject bother normal control . 3 . Compare rest cortical network subject non-bothersome tinnitus subject bothersome tinnitus subject without tinnitus Our null hypothesis difference resting-state cortical network , especially attention control network , tinnitus patient experience bother , tinnitus patient experience bother , subject without tinnitus . Through fcMRI , examine correlation blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signal establish auditory , attention , control , brain region rest brain compare finding already collect fcMRI scan bother tinnitus patient , control ( patient without tinnitus ) .</brief_summary>
