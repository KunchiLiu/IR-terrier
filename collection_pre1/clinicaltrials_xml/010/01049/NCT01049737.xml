	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Risk Factors Patients With Diabetes -a Prospective Study Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CARDIPP ( Cardiovascular Risk factor Patients Diabetes - Prospective study Primary care ) launch 2005 aim identify marker cardiovascular disease facilitate earlier individually adjust intervention middle age patient type 2 diabetes . The patient CARDIPP consecutively recruit primary health care centre county Östergötland Jönköping , Sweden November 2005 December 2008 . The study enrol 761 patient type 2 diabetes , age 55-65 year participation study perform extended annual follow . Blood pressure measure average three seated measurement take 1 minute apart standard anthropometric clinic evaluation perform include measurement waist circumference sagittal abdominal diameter new promising measurement abdominal obesity may serve surrogate marker insulin sensitivity . We also obtain record 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure . The patient fill detailed questionnaire evaluation life style factor exercise habit . Pedometer-determined ambulatory activity three consecutive day combination questionnaire use quantification daily physical activity . The cardiovascular investigation perform Department Physiology , Linköping University Hospital County Hospital Ryhov , Jönköping , Sweden . The patient subject cardiac ultrasonography calculation leave ventricular mass ejection fraction well diastolic cardiac function . Measurement carotid , femoral radial pulse pressure wave form perform aid tonometry , pressure wave analysis calculation central blood pressure . Furthermore , pulse wave velocity central elastic muscular peripheral artery define index arterial wall stiffness . The intima-media thickness ( IMT ) lumen diameter ( LD ) carotid artery evaluate use B-mode ultrasound . CARDIPP-R comprises re-investigation cohort four year completion baseline examination thus start November 2009 complete 2012 . In CARDIPP-R , participant baseline study invite re-investigation . The CARDIPP-R study protocol cardiac ultrasonography , carotid ultrasonographic investigation tonometry measurement carotid , femoral radial pulse pressure wave form pulse wave velocity follow CARDIPP baseline protocol .</detailed_description>
