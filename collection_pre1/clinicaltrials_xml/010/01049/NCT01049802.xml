	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized control feasibility study determine whether navigation guide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) healthy hemisphere patient subacute stroke beneficial effect give concurrently task-oriented motor rehabilitation arm hand . Navigation guide rTMS require structural MRI scan target stimulation therefore structural MRI perform subject . In addition study intend determine whether measure motor tract integrity ( MTI ) assess navigated brain stimulation ( NBS ) MRI diffusion tensor image use clarify prognosis motor recovery monitor progress rehabilitation . 30 subject ischemic hemorrhagic stroke 3-9 month prior enrollment residual upper limb hemiplegia randomize receive either 1 Hz rTMS contralesional hemisphere 30 minute 3 time week 6 week along rehabilitation therapy sham rTMS contralesional hemisphere 30 minute 3 time week 6 week along rehabilitation therapy . Primary outcome improvement Action Research Arm Test , measure arm hand function people stroke . Outcomes measure immediately post treatment , 3 month 6 month post treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES To determine whether NBS guide 1Hz rTMS target motor representation area hand muscle healthy brain hemisphere beneficial effect motor recovery correspond stroke-affected muscle combine standardized task-oriented motor rehabilitation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1 . To determine whether motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) elicit paretic and/or plegic muscle patient stroke use navigate TMS ( eXimia NBS ) target anatomical cortical area represent affect muscle . 2 . To determine correlation exist MEPs , TMS parameters clinical deficit limb function . 3 . To determine prognostic value MEPs TMS parameter predict motor recovery stroke 4 . To determine diagnostic value MEPs TMS parameter monitor response rehabilitation 5 . To assess safety capture Serious Adverse Events single pulse rTMS delivery STUDY PROCEDURES The purpose study include risk benefit explain potential participant ask sign inform consent form . Potential participant screen inclusion exclusion criteria The study perform 2 part . In part 1 Nexstim eXimia NBS utilized neuronavigation third party TMS use deliver rTMS . In part 2 Nexstim eXimia NBS utilize together Nexstim eXimia TMS deliver rTMS . Part 2 commence patient participate Part 1 undergone study visit 22 ( see 5.1 ) . 15 patient recruit part 1 15 patient part 2 ( 6 additional subject recruit assume 20 % drop rate ) In part 1 study 10 subject randomize rTMS treatment 5 subject randomize sham rTMS . Of 10 rTMS treatment subject , 5 give stimulation protocol A 5 give stimulation protocol B , described . In part 2 , either stimulation protocol A B chosen continue study base predetermine outcome criterion . In part 2 , 10 subject receive choose rTMS treatment 5 subject receive sham rTMS . The study consist 24 study visit addition 4 additional visit need complete outcome assessment . VISIT SCHEDULE The study perform 24 28 session : 1 . Visit 1 ( Screening visit ) : Baseline = 3-9 month stroke . The purpose visit obtain informed consent study ( previously obtain ) screen subject inclusion exclusion criterion . 2 . Visit 2 : Baseline assessment . The purpose visit establish baseline injury , motor status NBS parameter ( Hand motor mapping motor tract integrity , hemispheres - see appendix A ) . Subjects also undergo structural MRI . The subject randomize either rTMS sham treatment . The baseline visit may necessary take place 2 separate day . 3 . Visits 3-21 : During visit patient undergo standardize task-oriented motor rehabilitation hand . In addition patient receive rTMS therapy accord protocol group she/he randomize visit 1 . The visit take place 6 week period , three visit per week . During week visit take place separate day maximum two visit take place consecutive day . During first visit week ( visit 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 18 ) addition rTMS task-oriented motor rehabilitation , patient undergo measurement NBS parameter ( Motor tract integrity , hemisphere ) . 4 . Visit 22 : End task-oriented motor rehabilitation . The purpose visit establish extent recovery occur rehabilitation . The visit take place 3-5 day last rTMS/rehabilitation session include functional motor test evaluation NBS parameter ( Hand motor mapping motor tract integrity , hemisphere ) . 1-2 visit may need complete assessment . 5 ) Visit 23 : 1 month end rehabilitation therapy . The purpose visit determine whether change motor function NBS parameter occur within 1 month end therapy . The assessment include functional motor test evaluation NBS parameter ( Hand motor mapping motor tract integrity , hemisphere ) . 1-2 visit may need complete assessment . 6 ) Visit 24 : 6 month end rehabilitation therapy . The purpose visit determine long-term rehabilitation success . The assessment include functional motor test evaluation NBS parameter ( Hand motor mapping motor tract integrity , hemisphere . In patient experience new stroke TIA time , data prior event use analysis . 1-2 visit may need complete assessment .</detailed_description>
