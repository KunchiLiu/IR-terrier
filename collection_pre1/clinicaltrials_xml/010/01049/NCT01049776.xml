	<brief_summary>Lung Cancer common cause cancer death United States estimate mortality excess 160,000 , combine mortality see prostate , breast , colorectal cancer ( 1 ) . Most patient Lung Cancer Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers ( NSCLC ) 25-30 % patient NSCLC ( Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ) resectable disease ( Stage I II ) time diagnosis . The vast majority patient advance NSCLC ( Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ) curable overall five year survival 11 % -14 % 1 . Chemotherapy beneficial patient locally advance metastatic disease . Numerous phase III study determine superiority systemic chemotherapy best supportive care . Platinum base chemotherapy widely accept standard care initial treatment advance NSCLC . However first line chemotherapy modest best . A randomized trial compare four commonly use chemotherapy regimen United States fail show clearly superior arm also confirm dismal prognosis patient . The response rate 1207 patient 18.6 % median survival eight month one year survival 33.5 % two year survival 12 % 5 . Clearly different paradigm need treatment disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Better therapy patient NSCLC ( Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ) progress initial chemotherapy urgently need . Besides VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , human lung cancer know express PDGFR ( platelet-derived growth factor receptor ) . NSCLC , like cancer , involve defect signal transduction pathway . Receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) play pivotal role signal pathway , transmit extracellular molecular signal cytoplasm and/or nucleus cell . Among RTKs receptor polypeptide growth factor epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , insulin , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , neurotrophins ( i.e. , NGF ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) . Phosphorylation RTKs activate cytoplasmic domain kinase function , turn activates downstream signal molecule . Thus , RTKs key mediator cellular signal well oncogenesis result over-expression activation RTKs substrates . Due pivotal role normal aberrant signaling , RTKs subject increase focus potential drug target treatment certain type cancer . For example , Herceptin.RTM. , inhibitor HER2/neu , currently approve therapy certain subset breast cancer . Iressa.TM . ( ZD1839 ) Tarceva.TM . ( OSI-774 ) , small-molecule inhibitor EGFR , approve treatment NSCLC . Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor ( PDGFRs ) family RTKs play important role regulation normal cell growth differentiation . PDGFRs involve variety pathological process , include atherosclerosis , neoplasia , tissue repair , inflammation . PDGFRs , consist two isoforms ( alpha beta ) , membrane protein-tyrosine kinase , upon bind PDGF , become activated , via recruitment SH domain-containing effector molecule , initiate distinct overlap signal cascade coordinate cellular response . Expression constitutively active PDGFR lead cellular transformation suggest , normal cell , PDGFR activity must tightly regulate oppose continuous activation downstream effector . PDGFR beta , example , know over-expressed large number tumor , PDGF treatment cause transformation malignant tumor variety experimental system . One study report apparent expression PDGFR alpha nearly 100 % human lung cancer tumor examine , report growth inhibition lung cancer cell line , A549 , Gleevec , effect surmise mediate via PDGFR inhibition . Donnem et al evaluate 335 resected patient stage I III NSCLC . Using IHC ( immunohistochemical staining ) expression PDGF-A , -B , -C -D along PDGFR alpha beta . In multivariant analysis high tumor cell expression PDGF-B PDGF- alpha independent negative prognostic predictor . They suggest PDGF inhibition may option treatment NSCLC . Socinski et al recently describe activity sunitnib malate ( SU11248 ) oral , multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor target VEGFR , PDGFR , KIT , FLT3 RET tumor cell , tumor neovasculature pericytes . In open-label , two-stage , multicenter phase II trial evaluate single-agent activity sunitinib refractory NSCLC , patient confirm diagnosis NSCLC , ECOG PS 0-1 , recent gross hemoptysis , brain metastasis , patient ( pt ) previously treat 1-2 chemotherapy regimen , adequate end-organ function , pt receive sunitinib 50 mg/day po 4 week ( wks ) follow 2 wks treatment ( 6 wks consider cycle ) . A total 64 pt enrol 63 pt treat . Six confirm partial response observe among 63 treated patient . Stable disease observe additional 12 pt ( 19.0 % treated patient ) . Based study , Sunitinib appear single-agent activity previously treat pt recurrent advance NSCLC , level activity similar currently approve agent . Sunitinib well tolerate population . The trial extend explore continuous dose strategy sunitinib 37.5 mg/day po . In addition VEGF PDGFR , expression c-kit describe NSCLC . Moreover , find effect survival . Micke et al , stain tumor tissue 95 consecutive patient adenocarcinoma lung , use polyclonal c-kit antibody . c-kit expression correlate relevant clinical parameter obtain chart review . Positive c-kit expression tumor tissue observe 61 95 patient ( 64 % ) . Univariate analysis show significant effect T ( p = 0.003 ) , N ( p = 0.001 ) M stage ( p &lt; 0.001 ) well performance status ( p = 0.001 ) , surgical resection ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , LDH serum level ( p = 0.016 ) survival . In contrast , c-kit protein expression non- significant ( p = 0.913 ) . However , multivariate Cox regression influential parameter reveal significant effect c-kit expression survival . They conclude , receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit frequently express adenocarcinoma lung relevant effect patient survival . They also conclude result study support clinical trial target c-kit receptor specific c-kit inhibitor . Combined blockade VEGF , PDGFR c-kit may result good outcome patient Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma . Pazopanib novel , orally active small molecule inhibitor target multiple tyrosine kinase include VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , PDGFR-alpha - beta , c-kit . An antitumor effect due inhibit VEGF driven angiogenic pathway well establish . In addition effect VEGF receptor , pazopanib target additional tyrosine kinase include PDGF receptor c-kit establish role tumorigenesis oncogenic mutation describe . Preliminary data phase I study pazopanib patient solid tumor demonstrate early evidence antitumor activity . Among 43 patient enrol , minimal response occur 4 patient stable disease &gt; 6 month , observe additional 6 patient . Pazopanib well tolerate dos 2000 mg daily . Pazopanib potent selective , orally available , small molecule inhibitor VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 , PDGF-α , PDGF-β , c-kit tyrosine kinase ( TKs ) . The agent selectively inhibit proliferation endothelial cell stimulate VEGF basic fibroblast growth factor . In non-clinical angiogenesis model , pazopanib inhibit VEGF-dependent angiogenesis dose-dependent manner xenograft tumor model , twice-daily administration pazopanib significantly inhibited tumor growth mice implant various human tumor cell . Upon chronic oral dosing , pazopanib expect inhibit VEGF driven angiogenesis consequence , limit solid tumor growth . Because angiogenesis necessary growth metastasis solid tumor , VEGF believe pivotal role process , pazopanib treatment may broad-spectrum clinical utility . Based ability target multiple tyrosine kinase include VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , PDGFR-alpha beta c-kit , implicate non small cancer , investigation Pazopanib patient non small cell lung cancer warrant .</detailed_description>
