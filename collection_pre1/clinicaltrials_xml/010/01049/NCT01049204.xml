	<brief_summary>Impact Maraviroc , ART CCR5 inhibitor , intensification immune function HIV-1 infected subject receive immunisation novel antigens The purpose study investigate impact add Maraviroc ( anti-HIV agent ) participant 's normal HIV medication , immune function . As part study participant also receive three different vaccination skin test . The study also look whether Maraviroc influence body 's response . The vaccine give stimulate body 's immune system , therefore evaluate impact Maraviroc . The duration study 24 week plus screening period 4 week prior start study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Maraviroc Immune Function HIV-1 Infected Subjects Receiving Immunisation With Novel Antigens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maraviroc CCR5 antagonist potent anti-HIV-1 activity , demonstrate treatment naïve experience setting . Binding maraviroc CCR5 lead loss receptor function . Individuals non-functioning CCR5 due 32 base pair deletion encode gene observe 1 % frequency northern European Caucasian population . These individual near normal immune function , although differential response renal transplant West Nile virus report relative individual functional CCR5 . The modest impact immune function indicative functional overlap CCR5 CC chemokine receptor . While precise role CCR5 establish , data suggest role chemotaxis inflammation . An excess clinical event , infective , inflammatory malignant , report person receive maraviroc relative placebo efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy 48 week follow-up . Indeed , individual randomize maraviroc noted study modestly great increase CD4 T-cell number , account change lymphocyte count rate viral suppression . The impact inclusion maraviroc antiretroviral treatment regimen immune function report . In chronically infect HIV-1+ individual progress AIDS , full functionality anti-HIV-1 CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte response progressively lose . This accompany diminished response neo- recall antigens skin anergy ( loss DTH response ) . This likely dependent loss function number HIV-1-specific CD4+ helper T lymphocytes ( Appay Sauce 2008 ) . This process apparently , least partially , irreversible despite otherwise successful , currently use antiretroviral drug regimen . Accumulation functionally inert ( 'anergic ' ) HIV-1-specific CD4+ CD8+ CD28- CTLA-4hi T cell observe , lack proliferative IL-2 produce ability cytolytic function despite maintain capacity produce IFN-γ ( Deeks Walker 2007 ) . A balanced response host respond appropriately prevalent antigen , HIV-1 Gag , yet remain relatively quiescent , may prove strong functional correlate virologic control ( Imami et al . 2002 ; Imami et al . 2007 ) . Recent work show tetanus antibody response significantly impair HIV patient successful ART ( Hart et al . 2007 ) . A recently identify CD4 T-cell subset , know follicular T cell ( TFH ) play crucial role development humoral immune response protein antigens tetanus toxoid ( King et al . 2008 ) . Follicular CD4 T cell express chemokine receptor call CXCR5 , protein call inducible co-stimulatory factor ( ICOS ) readily identify peripheral blood . Follicular CD4 T cell prone activation induce cell death believe major mechanism CD4 T-cell depletion chronic HIV-1 infection therefore could vulnerable target retroviral disease . A reduction circulate CD4 TFH number and/or function may account failure HIV-1 patient respond tetanus vaccination . The aim study investigate impact addition maraviroc successful HIV-1 treatment regimen vitro ( lymphoproliferative , ELISpot assay ) vivo ( response subcutaneous GI administer vaccination antibody skin test applicable ) immune function , assess function CD4 TFH cell measure cytokine co-stimulatory protein expression T-cell subset . This 92 patient randomize , blind placebo control trial plan investigate impact addition maraviroc on-going successful PI/r base ART , regard multiple immunology marker include marker activation , CD4 CD8 T-cell subset , immune function ( Elispot lymphoproliferative response HIV-1 recall antigens and/or peptide ( Gag , TTox , CMV ) , antibody response oral ( cholera ) deep subcutaneous/IM ( meningococcus ) neoantigens recall antigen ( Tetanus toxoid ) ) ass function CD4 TFH cell measure cytokine co-stimulatory protein expression subset . Delayed type hypersensitivity test baseline week 24 , read 48 hour post administration Mantoux test . Participants stratify CD4 nadir , 50 % patient CD4 nadir &lt; 200 cells/µl blood . Maraviroc administer patient dose level 150mg BID . This dose approve use UK .</detailed_description>
