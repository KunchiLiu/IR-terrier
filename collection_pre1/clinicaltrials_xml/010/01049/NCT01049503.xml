	<brief_title>Effect pH Fluoride Concentration Dentifrices Caries Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dentifrices recognize one contributor increase prevalence dental fluorosis , due fact child early childhood usually eat lot brush . As alternative reduction fluorosis suggest reduce concentration fluoride toothpaste , however , efficacy well establish , increase pH toothpaste acidic , great diffusion F enamel . Therefore , study aim ass overall effect pH fluoride concentration liquid dentifrice control child dental caries fluoridate area . A randomized double-blind study conduct approximately 360 child age 2 4 year old public daycare center locate fluoridated area . Children examine two examiner classify accord caries activity . For 12 month , child use 3 time day , one toothpaste test , different concentration fluoride pH . At end period , child examine examiner check progression lesion . Clinical examination perform 2 calibrated examiner ( kappa 0.8 ) baseline 12 month . The diagnostic criterion caries activity ( active , inactive ) integrity surface lesion use . There quantitative assessment carious lesion fluorescence portable QLF equipment . In half sample , nails plaque collect 6 month initiation dentifrice use . Samples plaque analyze fluoride use ion-specific electrode diffusion hexamethyldisiloxane-facilitated disiloxane ( HMDS ) . The presence nail F analyze describe . For statistical analysis use ANOVA test individual comparison .</detailed_description>
