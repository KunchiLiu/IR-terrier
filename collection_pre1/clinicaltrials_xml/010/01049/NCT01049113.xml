	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose-escalation Phase I study ON 013105 patient relapsed/refractory Lymphoma B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ( Philadelphia chromosome negative ) satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion . Patients receive weekly 2-hour IV infusion ON 013105 , evidence disease progression , intolerable adverse event , withdrawal patient consent . Up 12 additional patient treat RPTD level . The start dose 17 mg 2-hour weekly infusion . Each cycle comprise three week . Up 43 patient may enrol , approximately 7 37 patient enrol dose escalation portion study determine RPTD . After maximally administer dose attain least six patient receive tentative RPTD , 6 additional patient may enrol dose confirmation phase confirm RPTD level . Treatment administer Clinical Research center first dose patient give dose level . If toxicity , subsequent dos level patient may administer outpatient basis , unless hospitalization require another reason . According Simon accelerated titration design , one-patient cohort 100 % dose increment implement non-hematological grade 2 toxicity observe first 3-week cycle . The design convert standard 3/6 patient cohort start dose level grade 2 toxicity observe follow 40 % dose increment subsequent cohort . If none first three patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) first cycle ( 3 week ) , next 3 patient receive next dose level . If DLT one first three patient , dose level expand 6 patient . If 1 patient 6 experience DLT , next patient receive next dose level . If ≥ 2 patient experience DLT dose level , dose level declare Maximally Administered Dose . The Maximally Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) RPTD high dose level Maximally Administered Dose 0 3 patient one 6 patient DLT . Dosing reduced immediate low dose patient experience DLT time . If Grade 1 non-hematological toxicity occur , treatment continue original dose without dose reduction . Patients stable disease response continue treatment eight 3-week cycle . Further continuation determine clinical judgment Investigator . Patients drop reason may re-enter trial . Blood sample collect Day 1 first cycle pharmacokinetic assessment . Responses assess accord Cheson , B.D. , et al. , Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma , J Clin Oncol 2007 . 25 : p. 579-86 .</detailed_description>
