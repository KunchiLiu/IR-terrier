	<detailed_description>A phase 1 open-label , dose find study AC220 patient solid tumor .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Males females age ≥18 year 2 . Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form study 3 . Available periodic followup investigative site 4 . Able swallow liquid study drug 5 . ECOG performance status 0 2 6 . Histological diagnosis primary solid tumor malignancy meet follow criterion : Evidence ( radiographic tissue confirmation ) disease metastatic ( locally advance disease allowable surgical local therapeutic option exists ) ; Disease progress follow currently available standard therapy curative therapy exists ( Prior adjuvant , neoadjuvant , investigational therapy permit . ) 7 . Measurable disease computer tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan per RECIST . 8 . Prior anticancer therapy , radiotherapy , hormonal , immunotherapy allow . Patients must recover toxicity prior therapy ( ie , toxicity resolve Grade 1 , pretreatment baseline , deem irreversible ) . At least 4 week must elapse since last systemic therapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas , mitomycinC , liposomal doxorubicin ) , immunotherapy , radiotherapy begin study drug administration . For participant GIST approve tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , least 2 week must elapse since last dose TKI . 9 . Adequate bone marrow function , define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ( neutrophils band ) ≥1.5 x 10^9 cells/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9 cells/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL 10 . Adequate hepatic function , define : Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN 11 . Adequate renal function , define : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional ULN 12 . Prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time ( PT PTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN 13 . Serum potassium , magnesium , calcium level least within institutional normal limit , every effort make keep potassium concentration 4.0 mEq/dL , magnesium concentration 1.8 mg/dL , serum calcium normal concentration administration oral/IV potassium and/or magnesium and/or calcium replacement study . If possible , potassium magnesium ( calcium ) concentration least keep within institutional normal limit . 14 . Fully recover ( ≤ Grade 1 return baseline deem irreversible ) acute effect prior cancer therapy initiation study drug administration . 15 . Baseline leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 45 % ( ≥ institutional low limit normal institutional low limit normal 45 % ) assess 2dimensional ECHO MUGA per institutional practice . If repeat LVEF assessment require , modality use throughout duration study , whenever possible . 16 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study least 3 month study manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) post menopausal ( define amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive month ; hormone replacement therapy [ HRT ] document serum follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL ) . Additionally , premenopausal woman use oral , implanted injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence , whose partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) , consider childbearing potential . 17 . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] ) within 72 hour prior start study drug . 1 . WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable contraceptive method avoid pregnancy entire study period least 3 month study . 2 . Women pregnant breastfeed 3 . WOCBP positive pregnancy test enrollment prior study drug administration 4 . Men unwilling unable use acceptable method birth control sexual partner WOCBP entire study period least 3 month completion study 5 . Patients know untreated , symptomatic uncontrolled brain central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis . Patients treat brain CNS metastases radiographically stable 3 month longer eligible . 6 . A serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability patient receive study drug 7 . Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease , include : A myocardial infarction within 12 month prior study entry Uncontrolled angina within 6 month prior study entry Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , patient history CHF NYHA class 3 4 past , unless screen ECHO MUGA within 14 day prior study entry result LVEF ≥ 45 % ( ≥institutional low limit normal ) Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de Pointes [ TdP ] ) Prolonged QTc interval preentry ECG ( ≥ 450 m ) Any history second third degree heart block Uncontrolled hypertension Obligate need cardiac pacemaker Complete leave bundle branch block Atrial fibrillation 8 . Known infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 9 . Known active hepatitis A , B , C active liver disease 10 . Dementia alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent 11 . Investigational agent within 4 week prior start study drug 12 . Use drug generally accept risk cause prolonged QTc and/or TdP and/or CYP3A4 inhibitor . Patients discontinued medication must washout period least 5 day least 5 halflives drug ( whichever great ) prior first dose study drug allow take medication study drug dose . 13 . Medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , judgment Principal Investigator Sponsor , could jeopardize patient safety interfere objective study .</criteria>
