	<brief_summary>Rationale : Intestinal permeability subject vary depend health status . It therefore important able measure quantify intestinal permeability standardize way . Subjects intestinal complaint ( like irritable bowel disorder ) obese subject find increase intestinal permeability . Different physiological condition might affect intestinal permeability ( IP ) . In clinic , sugar absorption test different blood urine marker use quantify IP . The sugar sucrose , mannitol , sucralose lactulose absorb differently small large intestine , result different sugar level urine . This indicate level intestinal permeability location increase permeability less permeable . A high-fat meal could use challenge test increase IP subject even . After high fat meal , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) could co-transported chylomicron . Small amount LPS co-transit dietary fat gut high-fat meal , thereby increase plasma LPS concentration . Because mentioned reason , could relevant determine intestinal permeability plasma LPS concentration consumption high-fat diet . Different method use determine intestinal permeability lean obese men , different condition . New parameter , like intestinal ( I ) fatty acid binding protein ( I-FABP ) , liver ( L ) -FABP , LPS inflammatory marker measure related outcome test , examine relation intestinal permeability . The association IP whole body electrical resistance examine , determine usefulness candidate non-invasive method IP investigation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : The study design randomize , cross-over open study . Study population : 16 healthy , lean ( BMI 20-25 kg.m-2 ) obese ( BMI 30-35 kg.m-2 ) male subject participate study , age 18-45 year . Intervention : On two different test day eight lean eight obese men supply sugar drink examine intestinal permeability normal condition combination oral fat load examine intestinal permeability stress condition . Main study parameters/endpoints : Intestinal permeability examine absorption test use four different sugar ( sucrose , mannitol , sucralose lactulose ) . New marker intestinal permeability , like I-FABP , L-FABP , LPS inflammatory marker measure well .</detailed_description>
