	<brief_title>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Using TMC278LA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While certain disease , use medication healthy people proven function prophylaxis , i.e . malaria , still unknown whether PrEP help prevent HIV infection exposure sex injection-drug use . To address whether PrEP safe effective use human , traditional sequence drug development step follow closely possible . TMC278 ( rilpivirine ) new investigational non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) discover development Tibotec , division Johnson &amp; Johnson . Data clinical development ( Phase IIB ) suggest TMC278 similar efficacy well side-effect profile compare , old , NNRTIs , efavirenz . Like TMC125 ( etravirine ) , TMC278 diarylpyrimidine ( DAPY - class molecule resembles pyrimidine nucleotide find DNA , show potency inhibit activity HIV reverse transcriptase ) . Tibotec currently investigate TMC278 two formulation : oral formulation HIV treatment , early phase , long act ( LA ) injectable formulation HIV treatment . The latter also potential application HIV transmission prevention . TMC278LA innovative drug formulation long apparent half life may allow administration PrEP monthly rather orally daily , ARV currently study PrEP agent . Therefore , phase I/II , open-label , prospective , single arm , pharmacokinetic clinical trial 100 HIV negative subject ( 50 % self-identified African ancestry 50 % female , approximately ) conduct . The study examine whether monthly dose TMC278LA exceed 600 mg i/m time period approximately six month , load regimen first two i/m injection separate two week , safe well tolerate HIV-negative subject . Investigation drug pharmacokinetics plasma genital secretion also carry order ensure optimal drug exposure drug administration . 100 evaluable subject enrol , approximately 50 African ancestry , 50 female . This provide 50-subject-years safety data order support later large phase III global efficacy study .</detailed_description>
