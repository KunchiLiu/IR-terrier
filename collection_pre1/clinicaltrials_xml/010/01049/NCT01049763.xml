	<brief_summary>This study plan characterize pharmacokinetic property oseltamivir active product -- oseltamivir carboxylate -- obesity order provide clinical guidance optimum oseltamivir treatment regimen severe influenza . It also prompt response new era influenza plan along recognition grow number obese person . The study finding available future management plan deal virus transmit easily person person show substantial antigenic change time . The primary focus statistical analysis verify effect obesity oseltamivir/oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics measure oseltamivir carboxylate Cmax , AUC ( 0-12 ) , AUC ( 0-24 ) , C12 , Î»z , t1/2 oseltamivir Cmax , AUC ( 0-12 ) , C12 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Pharmacokinetic Oseltamivir Healthy Obese Thai Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , cross-over , randomize pharmacokinetic study conduct approximately 12 obese 12 non obese adult subject one study center Thailand . Subjects receive 2 regimen random sequence 2 visit . 1 . Regimen A ; 75 mg single dose . 2 . Regimen B ; 150 mg single dose . All dose supervise document . Subjects 2 hospitalization complete visit 2 visit 3 assign sequence within . Each visit require hospitalization 40 hour ( 2 night 2 day ) . The subject randomize receive either regimen A B first admission ( visit 2 ) . Treatment allocation perform use computer-generated list random permutation AB sequence . Subjects receive regimen A receive regimen B second admission vice versa , 3 day wash period . Subjects return study centre follow-up visit 7-10 day complete last dosing assessment withdraw study . The total duration study participation approximately 4 week screen follow-up . Assessment safety profile do admission investigate team proceed regimen .</detailed_description>
