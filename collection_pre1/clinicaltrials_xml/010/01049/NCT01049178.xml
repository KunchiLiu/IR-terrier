	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS Dietary intake exogenous antioxidant show modest impact asthma inception control . Our work demonstrate endogenous antioxidant enzyme concentration far strong predictor asthma inception compare dietary antioxidant intake and/or serum antioxidant concentration . This likely regulate oxidative stress great extent , exogenous intake , antioxidant enzyme . The milk thistle plant extract , silymarin , show inducer endogenous antioxidant enzyme , superoxide dismutase catalase . As reactive oxygen specie implicate pathogenesis asthma , atopic asthmatic , endogenous superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) enzyme level know decrease , support increase SOD level , either induction endogenous SOD replacing fail endogenous SOD enzyme system mimetic endogenous enzyme , would beneficial protective . We hypothesize administration silymarin , inducer antioxidant enzyme , subject atopic asthma increase antioxidant enzyme concentration , decrease marker oxidative stress , decrease indirect measure airway inflammation correlate clinical outcome ( exhale nitric oxide , eNO ) , thus improve lung function symptom score participant asthma . To test hypothesis conduct randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled cross-over pilot investigation inducer endogenous antioxidant enzyme , silymarin , asthma . No clinical trial test either silymarin , inducer antioxidant enzymes patient asthma . We therefore aim determine whether novel treatment effective , inflammatory clinical endpoint improve treatment . Specific question related modification endogenous antioxidant enzyme prevalent asthma investigation aim address whether induction antioxidant enzymes alter inflammatory marker asthma know linked clinical endpoint , lung function oxidant stress . Measurements antioxidant enzyme make blood sample prior follow administration silymarin ; measure systemic oxidative stress make urine sample use assay isoprostanes , consider accurate marker oxidative stress currently available ; measure airway inflammation measure use exhaled NO , lung function test symptom control assess clinical measure disease control . Aim # 1 : To confirm oral administration silymarin subject atopic asthma increase endogenous antioxidant enzyme . We hypothesize silymarin increase level antioxidant enzyme , superoxide dismutase activity , catalase activity , glutathione peroxidase activity subject atopic asthma . To test hypothesis , first conduct dose escalation study determine optimal dosing , dose effect , washout airway inflammation , follow randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled cross-over pilot investigation supplementation silymarin subject atopic asthma measurement antioxidant enzyme activity pre- , completion active supplementation placebo arm study . Aim # 2 : To determine whether oral administration silymarin subject atopic asthma alters indirect measure airway inflammation systemic oxidative stress . We hypothesize silymarin decrease airway inflammation measure systemic oxidative stress . To test ass indirect measure airway inflammation , include exhale nitric oxide nitric oxide related product , measure systemic oxidant stress , urinary isoprostanes pre- , end supplementation study subject enrol clinical trial . Aim # 3 : To determine whether oral administration silymarin subject atopic asthma improves asthma morbidity , daily symptom , disease control , disease exacerbation , spirometry . We hypothesize silymarin improve asthma control decrease morbidity . Although powered outcome , test hypothesis ass evaluate trend magnitude effect silymarin asthma control , spirometry disease exacerbation study subject . Aim # 4 : To determine feasibility , acceptance randomization , adherence therapy , acceptance drug delivery dosing , ability maintain blinding , clinical effect size . The intent aim optimize overall protocol design procedures future large study .</detailed_description>
