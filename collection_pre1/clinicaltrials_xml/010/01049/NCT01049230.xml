	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine radiation use proton beam therapy kill germ cell tumor participant 's central nervous system . This type radiation use previously many patient different type cancer . There two type external radiation treatment , proton beam photon beam . In study examine effect proton beam radiation therapy . Studies suggest kind radiation spare normal tissue photon radiation therapy . The physical characteristic proton beam radiation let doctor safely increase amount radiation deliver tumor . We believe proton beam therapy potentially reduce side effect participant would normally experience photon radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Before participant begin radiation therapy scan do prepare radiation treatment . Doctors use information gather scan plan best way deliver radiation tumor . - Participants receive treatment outpatient Francis H. Burr Proton Center locate Massachusetts General Hospital . - Not everyone participates study receive amount proton radiation therapy . The length time amount radiation participant receive depend type germ cell tumor stage disease . - Radiation treatment give day , 5 day week ( Monday-Friday ) , 4-8 week depend condition participant 's disease . - During week proton radiation therapy , participant physical exam ask question general health problem might experience .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm germ cell tumor elevate AFP BHCG set radiographic disease consistent germ cell tumor . Disease must confine central nervous system . Participants need measurable disease . Most patient measurable disease time treatment . 3 year age old 25 year age young time diagnosis study evaluate disease entity pediatric population may differ adult population . Life expectancy great 12 month . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Baseline MRI brain spinal axis gadolinium prior chemotherapy require . If surgical resection perform postoperative MRI require . If patient receives chemotherapy prior radiation , postchemotherapy MRI brain require . If spinal involvement see initial MRI prior chemotherapy , MRI spine require chemotherapy prior radiation . Serum lumbar CSF must obtain evaluate alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) . This needed stratify patient pure GCT NGGCT . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Patients ineligible prior therapeutic radiation therapy &gt; 200 cGy deliver central nervous system . Patients ineligible chemotherapy complete great 1 year plan start date radiation therapy patient refer radiation therapy relapse follow regimen chemotherapy alone . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : Diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals diagnose treat within past 5 year cervical cancer situ basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Pregnant female</criteria>
