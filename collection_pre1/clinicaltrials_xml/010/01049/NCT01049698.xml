	<brief_summary>Aging associate decline muscle strength , power , overall functional ability lead disability loss independence . Furthermore , exist high prevalence obesity elderly greatly exacerbate aging-related decline function . To date , regular exercise , especially resistance exercise , know treatment consistently improve muscle function perhaps delay onset disability . However , individual experience magnitude benefit give exercise stimulus , accumulate data show obesity limit muscle adaptation chronic exercise.Therefore , propose study design determine effect caloric restriction improvement skeletal muscle function response RT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Overview : This 5-month randomized trial 130 old , overweight obese , sedentary men woman . Phase 1 involves recruitment screen followed baseline research testing ( Phase 2 ) . Next , subject randomly assign one two 5-month treatment ( Phase 3 ) : RT intervention alone ( RT ) RT caloric restriction ( RT+CR ) intervention . Subjects return visit completion 5 month intervention . A subset participant ( n=30 ) return 18 month follow . Interventions : Resistance training+ Caloric Restriction : Participants assign RT+CR group instruct follow hypocaloric diet ( -600 kcal/d ) 20 week , well resistance train program note below.In addition , participant provide daily calcium ( 1200 mg/d ) vitamin D ( 800 IU/d ) supplement.The intervention incorporate meal replacement , nutrition education , lifestyle behavior modification . Resistance training : The maximal weight lift correct form single repetition ( 1RM ) use prescribe intensity . Strength test repeat every 4 wks train load adjust consistent 70 % 1RM goal . Participants exercise 3 d/wk Nautilus resistance machine , supervision two exercise leader train basic life support emergency management procedure . All exercise take place Wake Forest University 's Department Health Exercise Science Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) . Participants exercise small group allow rotation/rest machine enhance social environment . Heart rate blood pressure measure session . Subjects warm-up walk cycle 5 minute slow pace follow large muscle flexibility exercise . The interventionists ensure participant adjust equipment appropriate body size complete exercise correct form . Training session end cool-down walking cycle 5 minute slow pace follow light stretching .</detailed_description>
