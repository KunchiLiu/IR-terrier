	<brief_title>Cost Utility Analysis Erythropoietin Anemia Treatment Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Thailand , study conduct find useful target Hb include cost effectiveness and/or cost utility analyse . The level quality life maximize risk minimize would optimal target . Dialysis patient carry high risk death general population . Anemia common complication find dialysis patient could lead mortality . Risk anemia occur HD patient CAPD patient blood loss less marked residual renal function maybe well preserve patient receive peritoneal dialysis.Although EPO include National List Essential Drugs ( NLED ) treatment anemia cause end stage renal disease maintain target hemoglobin cost EPO expensive . Cost utility analysis economic technique assess efficiency healthcare intervention measure combine outcome effectiveness , i.e. , survival quality life combination quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) .This study benefit measure care give level use part plan patient management program policy level decision making .</detailed_description>
