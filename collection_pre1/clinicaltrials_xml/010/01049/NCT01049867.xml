	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate intracoronary infusion autologous bone-marrow derive CD133+ endothelial precursor cell able promote neovascularization improve myocardial perfusion contractility patient refractory coronary heart disease , characterize poor response standard coronary intervention , severe impairment quality life , poor prognosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD133+ Cell Therapy Refractory Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Refractory Coronary Artery Disease significant cause mortality decrease quality life . Intracoronary infusion CD133+ progenitor cell viable treatment option patient condition . After clinical laboratory evaluation , 50-100 ml bone marrow obtain bone marrow aspiration posterior iliac crest local anesthesia . From sample , CD133+ endothelial progenitor cell isolate , purified pack within next 12 hour extraction , resuspend 30 ml saline solution . The patient undergo coronary catheterization selection target obstruct artery cell infusion , perform use balloon catheter hemodynamic monitoring . Once conclude , patient transfer intermediate care unit post-interventional observation approximately 24 hour release . Ambulatory follow-up perform specific interval determine efficacy safety intervention clinical laboratory examination , include image cardiac function study .</detailed_description>
