	<brief_summary>The plan trial compare anthracycline-free taxane base regimen versus modern third generation ( anthracycline/taxane-based ) regimen HER2/neu non-over expressing tumor . The aim define anthracycline-free standard spare anthracycline toxicity patient , modest benefit compound . Prior randomization chemotherapy patient HR positive disease OncotypeDXÂ® perform identify patient receive chemotherapy . Secondary objective trial compare overall survival toxicity two chemotherapy arm , evaluate survival observation arm perform translational research regard prognostic predictive factor .</brief_summary>
