	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Giving bendamustine hydrochloride together lenalidomide dexamethasone may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose bendamustine hydrochloride lenalidomide give together dexamethasone see well work treat patient relapsed multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Hydrochloride , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) bendamustine lenalidomide combination dexamethasone subject Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) first second relapse . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate confirm response rate bendamustine combination lenalidomide dexamethasone subject MM first second relapse . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety bendamustine combination lenalidomide dexamethasone . ( Phase I II ) II . To evaluate time-to-tumor-progression , progression-free survival , duration response , overall survival . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose escalation study bendamustine hydrochloride lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive dexamethasone orally IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 2 ; oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve least stable disease 6 course may continue receive lenalidomide dexamethasone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Dexamethasone may discontinue 12 course therapy treat investigator 's discretion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
