	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer lead cause death cancer . Because colonic cancer begin small adenoma , evolve carcinoma decade pre-emptive colonoscopic polypectomy prevent malignancy . For good colonoscopic examination ideally colon cleanse fecal material poor bowel preparation colonoscopy often lead inability reach cecum poor visualization mucosa . Thus , pathology may miss , repeat examination may schedule early interval plan procedure difficult time consume . In addition , poor bowel preparation increase risk significant complication . Perforations result maneuver great consequence set inadequate bowel preparation . In past two decade , various bowel preparation method propose include castor oil , anthraquinones , phenolphtalein magnesium citrate , combination low residue diet4-7 . Along agent , cleanse enema form traditional bowel preparation . Oral sodium phosphate ( Fleet Phospo-soda , C.B Fleet Co , Inc. , Lynchburg , Va. ) ( NaP ) preparation contain dibasic monobasic sodium phosphate proven cost effective since use worldwide8,9 . NaP osmotically draw plasma water bowel lumen promote bowel cleansing . NaP must accompany significant oral fluid prevent dehydration . Patients compromise renal function , dehydration , hypercalcemia hypertension use angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor experience phosphate nephropathy use oral NaP solution . Senna laxatives contain sennosides activate colonic bacteria direct effect intestinal mucosa increase rate colonic motility , enhance colonic transit , inhibit water electrolyte secretion10 . Sennosides may result hypokalemia atonic colon . The aim study ass bowel cleanse effect two different agent compare safety application , ease usage effect serum electrolyte .</detailed_description>
