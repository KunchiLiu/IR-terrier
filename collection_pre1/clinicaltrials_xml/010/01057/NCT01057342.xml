	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Dimethylxanthenone acetic acid may stop growth small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving paclitaxel carboplatin together dimethylxanthenone acetic acid may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give paclitaxel carboplatin together dimethylxanthenone acetic acid see well work treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel , Carboplatin , Dimethylxanthenone Acetic Acid Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess 24-week ( 6 month ) progression-free survival patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat paclitaxel , carboplatin , dimethylxanthenone acetic acid . Secondary - To assess efficacy safety regimen patient . - To evaluate predictive molecular marker gene expression analysis , serum proteomics , pharmacogenomics . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute , dimethylxanthenone acetic acid IV 20 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tissue sample may collect periodically predictive molecular marker gene expression analysis , plasma proteomics , pharmacogenomics . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
