	<detailed_description>We aim analyse adolescent mental illness effectiveness , side effect , serum level concentration antipsychotic ( olanzapine aripiprazole ) , antidepressant ( Duloxetine , Atomoxetine ) mean `` Therapeutic Drug Monitoring '' ( TDM ) order optimize dosage - effect relation minimize unwanted side effect . Therapeutic drug monitoring become quality measure psychopharmacotherapy adult child use successfully recently ( Hiemke 2008 ) . In 2007 , German Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry University Clinics found network `` TDM-network '' head Profs . C. Mehler-Wex J. Fegert Ulm ( www.tdm-kjp-de ) . The Viennese Child Adolescent Clinic part network . Most importantly , network must want independent pharmaceutical industry order get un-biased scientific result data . Within network , successfully establish participate clinical department possible take lead several scientific area . Highest ethical standard , data-protection rigorous design need protect childrens ' adolescent ' right . Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) implication treatment research : By definition , TDM signify dosage drug control concentration serum . It aim establish therapeutical range drug give thus minimize risk over- undermedication ( Pschyrembel 2002 ) . Indications therapeutic drug monitor general comprise follow aspect : - Poor response administer drug despite clinically establish dosage - Severe side effect despite clinically establish dosage - Combining medication bear potential interact adversely - Treatment patient risk ( immunosuppression , patient intensive care , patient need longterm treatment , patient high level comorbidity genetic abberations , patient risk non-compliance ) - Questionable adherence treatment regime -Child adolescent population The scientific background TDM refers assumption serum concentration substance along active metabolite represent good measure concentration brain actual dose ( Laux &amp; Riederer , 1992 ; Baumann et al. , 2004 ) . Additionally , state defined relation serum concentration clinical effect . This correlation could confirm e.g . tricyclic antidepressant imipramine und desipramine ( Baumann et al. , 2004 ) . Child Adolescent TDM The psychopharmacotherapy child adolescents differs essentially adult . It , nature , developmental pharmacotherapy ( Herpertz-Dahlmann et al. , 2003 ; Gerlach &amp; Warnke 2004 ) . On somatic basis , different developmental stage child adolescent , along pharmacokinetic variance , n't allow use similar dosage adult patient . Pharmacokinetics essentially influence body weight , neurophysiological aspect brain development , factor particularly prone vulnerability childhood adolescence , gastric milieu influence uptake medication , frequency gastric emptying , development connective tissue , proportional distribution body fat , hormone state , liver metabolism , regulation , expression function metabolize enzymes well serum flow target organ . Most administered drug , example , child adolescent psychiatry ( like tricyclic antidepressant , SSRIs , typical atypical antipsychotic ) partly entirely catalyze via CYP enzyme , localize liver . Although genetic expression limit first year life , regulation function largely dependent size organ relation well hormone serum concentration . Thus , factor liable change end puberty . All aspects prone much great variance side effect effect childhood adolescence compare later stage life ( Gerlach et al. , 2004 ) . The vast majority psychopharmacological agent child adolescent psychiatry Germany officially authorize age group ( Gerlach et al. , 2004 ) . Exceptions include , instance , methylphenidate treatment ADHD SSRI fluvoxamine , use child start age eight year , treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder . Since child adolescent ca n't deprive pharmacotherapy ( give potential major benefit see clinical practice experience data young adult ) , administration off-label unlicensed drug practice implement wide base . As obvious consequence , safety efficacy criterion establish Medicines Act , n't apply patient concern . Thus , considerable insecurity among , medical staff well parent ( Gerlach &amp; Warnke , 2004 ) , adhere psychopharmacotherapy child adolescent psychiatry . Addressing issue need efficacy safety psychopharmacotherapy youth , TDM childhood adolescence provide general indication administration psychotropic drug , field largely understudied ; also open opportunity assessment clinical response individually adjust dosage drug concentration . Overall TDM intend make psychopharmacotherapy evidence-based safe . This important issue scientific field medicine desideratum long await . From scientific viewpoint , standardized study need assess therapeutic range plasma concentration child adolescent . Such study give important insight way drug metabolize distribute somatically . In addition , TDM consider scientifically valid reliable tool contributes essentially clinical observation symptom count open whole new dimension data base diagnostics consequently therapy directive . In respect , take essential method improve quality mental health care among child adolescent . We want ensure enhance qulaity psychopharmacological treatment severe anorexia nervosa , ADHD depression .</detailed_description>
