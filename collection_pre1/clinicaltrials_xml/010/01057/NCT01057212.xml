	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , open-label , single arm phase II trial combination bevacizumab ixabepilone patient advanced- metastatic non-squamous NSCLC progressive first second-line therapy . The main objective evaluate progression-free survival patient advance metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treat ixabepilone bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Bevacizumab Ixabepilone Advanced Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first six patient enrol lead-in phase study utilize reduce dose ixabepilone . Patients monitor safety toxicity . If combination find tolerable feasible , accrual continue full-dose regimen . Toxicity monitor real-time study investigator . Should unexpected increase toxicity detect , trial accrual halt full analysis . Bevacizumab administer intravenously , 10 mg/kg , every two week . Ixabepilone administer intravenously , 16 mg/m2 , weekly 3 4 week 28-day schedule , first six patient enrol . Ixabepilone administer intravenously , 20mg/m2 , weekly 3 4 week 28-day schedule , remain 40 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
