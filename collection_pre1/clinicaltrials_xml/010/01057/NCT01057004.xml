	<detailed_description>Cardiac insufficiency main secondary diagnosis 10 % hospitalised patient . Due age-structure population increase life expectancy myocardial infarction prevalence increase . Even though prognosis patient establish heart failure improve remain serious , average survival rate 50 % 4 year . Approximately 2 % expense health care cause cardiac insufficiency , expensive hospitalization phase . The rehospitalisation rate first hospital stay 50 % within 6 month . By optimal , guideline-adjusted therapy hospital- post-hospital-stay rehospitalisation rate could reduce 50 % . But knowledge concern therapy base study result , generate select patient control study condition . Thus necessary collect data development therapy , successes well complication clinical everyday life . Results concern quality therapy require measure need contribute quality assurance improvement . Due reason EVITA initiate follow objective , aim , structure , organization form : The register substitute randomize , control , multi-center clinical trial ( RCT ) define prospective research question . Such randomized study investigate `` efficacy '' therapy , i.e . clinical effect experimental condition . In contrast , register investigate transferability RCT result daily routine within hospital , call `` effectiveness '' . Both study type complementary need judgment clinical efficiency well security aspect possible adverse reaction . Furthermore EVITA function idea supplier coordinate possible future study . Other important task register : ( ) establishment recommendation optimal medicinal therapy ( OMT ) well ICD- CRT-treatment ; ( ii ) establishment quality assurance measure , include monitor new therapy . Every 6 month study center receives complete overview concern center data comparison data supply center .</detailed_description>
