	<detailed_description>Artemisia dracunculus L. , often call Russian tarragon , wild specie close relative common cooking tarragon ( know French tarragon Artemisia dracunculus sativa dracunculoides ) . Artemisia , specifically , Artemisia dracunculus , storied history medicinal use human , particularly treatment diabetes . The Artemisia dracunculus extract describe project PMI-5011 originally identify screen extract hypoglycemic activity diabetic mouse promise candidate development nutritional supplement diabetes . The active compound preparation believe member sesquiterpene , lactone flavanoid group , Artemisia family well know . Preliminary data laboratory suggest PMI-5011 may significant effect improve carbohydrate metabolism enhance molecular event insulin action skeletal muscle . PMI-5011 herbal botanical dietary supplement prepare Artemisia dracunculus L. ( Russian Tarragon ) help maintain normal blood glucose concentration . PMI-5011 ethanolic extract fresh herb grow standardized hydroponic condition maximum consistency nutritional content . Artemisia large family herb rich history safe medicinal culinary use . PMI-5011 able significantly decrease blood glucose concentration Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse genetically diabetic KK-Ay mouse . The preparation , however , decrease blood glucose concentration non-diabetic mouse rat . The historical use plant extract suggest safe non-toxicity confirm acute chronic toxicity study non-mutagenicity confirm AMES test . PMI-5011 may several mode action lead ability decrease blood glucose concentration diabetic animal , suggest comprised several different nutrient act synergistically . Some vitro activity PMI-5011 include modulation GLP-1 binding receptor stimulation insulin-mediated glucose uptake culture skeletal muscle cell . PMI-5011 also decrease expression PEPCK liver diabetic animal may decrease hepatic glucose output result . Recently , vitro assay identify PMI 5011 may potent effect reduce phosphastase activity thereby promote insulin sensitivity . The overall objective study evaluate effect high PMI 5011 obese insulin resistant , yet non-diabetic subject . The study double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , pilot study subject randomize receive either placebo PMI-5011 ( 4 500mg caps/TID ) total 3 week treatment . Each subject continue dosage PMI-5011 matching placebo entire duration treatment . For pilot trial , precise technique ( hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp ) use assess insulin sensitivity .</detailed_description>
