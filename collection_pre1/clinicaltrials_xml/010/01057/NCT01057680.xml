	<brief_summary>As age , experience reduction muscle bone inevitably decrease strength ability perform task daily live gardening , carry grocery , climb stair . Health cost associate age muscle bone loss billion dollar . With projected increase life expectancy , incidence muscle bone loss rise drain healthcare system , great need hospitalization , treatment , rehabilitation . Without effective strategy counteract age muscle bone loss , may face healthcare crisis future . Creatine , compound find red meat seafood , increase creatine phosphate store muscle , provide increase energy high-intensity exercise . Short-term ( i.e . 3-4 month ) resistance-exercise supplementation creatine , show favorable effect property age muscle bone . However , longer-term ( i.e . 1 year ) effect intervention unknown . Therefore , purpose innovative research determine longer-term effect resistance-exercise creatine supplementation ( 0.1gâ€¢kg-1 ) old adult . The primary dependent variable assess include muscle hypertrophy , bone mineral bone geometry , strength , urinary blood indicator liver kidney function . This innovative , multidisciplinary research help contribute successful pursuit prolong independent living improve age musculoskeletal health old Saskatchewan adult . Saskatchewan provide relevant set research , give high percentage old adult ( 15 % ) , compare national average ( 12 % ) . We hypothesize creatine supplementation increase muscle mass , strength , bone mineral density placebo .</brief_summary>
