	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Mechanisms Action Lifibrol Pravastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated lipoprotein concentration major risk factor development atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . Effective reduction low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol concentration show greatly reduce risk . The widely use lipid-lowering agent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase inhibitor ( statin ) , show reduce morbidity mortality coronary heart disease ( CHD ) large prospective clinical trial . However , despite significant LDL-C reduction approximately 70 % event still avoid search improve alternative lipid-modifying drug therapy continuous . HDL-C address potential modifiable target decrease residual risk , since low HDL-C concentration acknowledge independent risk factor CHD . However , recent study show increase HDL-C concentration surprisingly associate decrease atherosclerosis , possible increase . Therefore seem concentration HDL-C target HDL function reverse cholesterol transport . Lifibrol lipid-modifying drug show improve HDL particle flux via increase apoA-I production , HDL-raising property . Furthermore , decrease dose-dependently LDL-C 40 % . It major interest clarify , apparently unique , mechanisms action compound , whose LDL-lowering effect comparable magnitude one statin . The mechanisms lifibrol 's LDL-lowering effect completely clarify . There evidence suggesting increase hepatic LDL receptor expression sterol-independent mechanism , i.e . reduction cholesterol synthesis , mechanism action statin . ApoB turnover study indicate increased catabolism LDL rather decrease hepatic apoB production may responsible cholesterol-lowering effect . Since apoB metabolism cholesterol synthesis closely related , design study investigate effect lifibrol metabolism apoB-100-containing lipoproteins endogenous sterol synthesis parallel , use stable isotope method . In addition , since lifibrol may inhibit cholesterol synthesis step earlier HMG-CoA reductase , investigate [ 13C ] acetate catabolism analyze 13CO2 appearance breath . The HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor pravastatin use comparator , since mode action well characterize . The principle question address ( ) whether lifibrol exert cholesterol-lowering effect decrease synthesis/enhanced catabolism apoB-100-containing lipoprotein inhibition sterol de novo synthesis ( ii ) whether effect interrelate .</detailed_description>
