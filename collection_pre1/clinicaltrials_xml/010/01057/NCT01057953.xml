	<brief_summary>The majority clinical situation suggestive increase genetic risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) explain simple monogenic model . Our work hypothesis fraction clinical condition suggestive increase genetic risk CRC ( familial aggregation , early age tumour onset , development multiple primary CRC ) due combination limit number genetic variation , confer moderate risk CRC , whose combination result high risk . This study , retrospective prospective , association study compare frequency select genetic variation , alone combination , patient ( case ) whose clinical presentation suggestive increase genetic risk present know Mendelian form CRC , control , order ass association variation non-Mendelian genetic form CRC . The inclusion criterion : CRC two first degree relative , one diagnose 61 year age ; CRC diagnose 51 year age advance colorectal adenoma 41 year age ; multiple primary CRCs individual , first diagnose 61 year age The exclusion criterion : Lynch syndrome , adenomatous polyposis hamartomatous polyposis . The genetic variation analyze include ( ) SNPs detect GWAS associate CRC . ( ii ) Risk factor correspond functional polymorphism within candidate gene . ( iii ) Imbalance TGFbR1 allelic expression . Sample size calculate obtain 80 % power odds ratio 2.5 since aim study determine genetic variation confer moderate risk . In order cover possibility reasonable even genetic variation low frequency 0.03 high frequency 0.90 , target sample size set 700 case 350 control . The recruitment patient perform national level cancer genetics department ensure correct evaluation personal familial history French molecular diagnosis laboratory network ensure routine analysis main gene involve CRC . The control population compose healthy subject Caucasian origin 45 60 year age , without personal familial history among first-degree relative colorectal tumour . Demonstration combination limit number genetic variation , confer moderate risk CRC , result high risk would allow base , select family , evaluation risk relatives indication colonoscopy analysis gene variant combination would confer high risk . This study confirm invalidate contribution aTGFbR1 allelic expression imbalance determinism early-onset CRC familial aggregation CRC . The demonstration involvement CRC genetic variation strong effect specific combination interest general understand molecular basis CRC .</brief_summary>
