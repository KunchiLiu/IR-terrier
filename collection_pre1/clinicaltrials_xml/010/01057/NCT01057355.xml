	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cyst common , pancreas cyst malignant potential . Usual treatment cyst either observation surgical removal part pancreas . Minimally invasive treatment via endoscopy describe , use endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) guide ethanol injection . Such study exclude cyst communicate main pancreatic duct , avoid burn main pancreatic duct ethanol . In study , pancreas cyst communicate main pancreas duct treat ethanol via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) and/or EUS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Ethanol Ablation Communicating Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo EUS and/or ERCP outpatient . For cyst show communicate main pancreas duct , balloon catheter place main pancreatic duct via ERCP . The balloon catheter isolate cyst main pancreatic duct , allow ethanol injection cyst . A pancreatic duct stent place patient , require repeat endoscopy removal another time .</detailed_description>
