	<detailed_description>Empirically , several patient MS report improved function warm climate therapy vacation . This contrast heat intolerance frequently report MS. Heat intolerance seem , however , individually distribute among MS patient , may seem related degree warmth . Sixty patient gait problem without heat intolerance include cross-over study .
