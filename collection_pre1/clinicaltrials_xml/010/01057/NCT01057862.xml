	<detailed_description>Pathological gambling ( PG ) significant public health problem cause significant devastation individual affect family . Those afflicted may experience unemployment , considerable debt , marital problem , family dysfunction , legal trouble , incarceration , mental health issue include suicidality . Prevalence estimate vary estimate put 1 % 2 % , annual cost $ 5 billion United States alone . Thus , PG costly affect individual family , also society general . The current treatment usual PG limit various type counsel , psychotherapy ( e.g . cognitive behavioral therapy ) , self-help group Gamblers Anonymous . However , treatment modality show particularly effective . High rate relapse common treatment attrition often concern . Currently , drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration treatment PG . Pharmacological treatment study still infancy show considerable promise . Several placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial conduct , result limit small sample size , short duration , exclusion individual co-occurring disorder , heterogeneity treatment response measure diagnostic criterion use inclusion . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) show mixed result PG . Some study suggest benefit active drug placebo study . Mood stabilizer extensively study report suggest certain patient , co-morbid bipolar spectrum disorder , may benefit type medication . Atypical antipsychotic also try limited success may appropriate patient co-occurring psychotic disorder . Opioid antagonists naltrexone nalmefene , possibly modulation mesolimbic dopamine system , demonstrate preliminary efficacy superior placebo treat PG . As substance use disorder ( SUD ) , suggest opioid antagonist may exert therapeutic benefit help reduce appetitive urge craving present symptomatology addiction . From neurochemical perspective , pharmacological action opioid antagonist block effect endogenous endorphin mu-opioid receptor may inhibit dopamine release nucleus accumbens . The mu-opioid system generally think involve mediation hedonic , reward reinforce behavior . The mu-opioid mesolimbic pathway implicate PG . For example , problem gambler show elevated level endogenous opioid β-endorphin gambling ( Shinohara et al 1999 ) . Naltrexone , pure opioid antagonist , FDA-approved medication two label indication . Firstly , blockade effect exogenously administer opioids . And secondly , treatment alcohol dependence . However , 's label clear show provide therapeutic benefit except part appropriate plan management addiction . Naltrexone investigate PG part due propose ability modulate mesolimbic dopamine pathway . In preliminary study , show efficacy superior placebo . As clinical trial alcohol dependence , appear naltrexone target crave urge state . In fact , naltrexone show particularly effective individual strong urge gamble treatment onset . A double-blind , placebo-controlled twelve-week investigation naltrexone 83 subject ( 45 use analysis ) describe ( Kim et al 2001 ) . Doses initiated 25 mg/day titrate maximum dosage 250 mg/day , average final dose 187.50 mg/day ( SD=96.45 ) . Naltrexone superior placebo associate statistically significant improvement various measure gamble severity , self-reported clinician-administered . A post hoc analysis show naltrexone effective gambler report severe urge . More recently , eighteen-week double-blind , placebo-controlled study naltrexone PG report ( Grant et al 2008 ) . Following single-blinded one-week placebo lead-in , seventy-seven PG subject randomize daily dos 50mg , 100mg , 150mg naltrexone . Unlike previous shorter naltrexone study , group include subject range co-occurring disorder . Outcomes significantly differ among three dosage . The three active arm study combine compare placebo . Analyses show naltrexone effective placebo decrease PG severity , gamble urge , gamble behavior , psychological functioning . Nalmefene hydrochloride similar-acting opioid antagonist . Contrary naltrexone , nalmefene associate possible liver toxicity . A sixteen-week multicenter , randomize , dose-ranging , double-blind , placebo-controlled investigation conduct 15 outpatient treatment center U.S. , include Yale ( Grant et al 2006 ) . Two hundred seven male female subject randomize either 25mg , 50 mg , 100mg per day equivalent placebo . All three active arm begin one-week course 25mg per day . This study include individual co-occurring disorder . Subjects assign active arm show statistically significant reduction gamble severity . The 50mg 100mg dos result intolerable side effect . It appear low 25mg dose efficacious . In fact , 25mg dose unique term demonstrate superiority placebo base overall response treatment measure Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) improvement scale . Based previous encouraging result Yale elsewhere , study attempt replicate extend safety , tolerability , efficacy finding opioid antagonist management PG . In addition , study provide much need information regard pharmacotherapy conjunction treatment usual PG .</detailed_description>
