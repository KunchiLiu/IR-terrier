	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To characterize Stat3 signal pathway activity primary tissue sample pediatric patient acute myeloid leukemia determine percentage sample increase activity well understand mechanism lead increased activity . - To evaluate presence constitutive Stat3 activation sensitivity Stat3 activation low high dos cytokine . - To evaluate expression level Stat3 protein well upstream downstream regulator Stat3 activation . - To classify tissue sample accord Stat3-activation pattern , correlate result event-free survival overall survival order determine whether increase Stat3 phosphorylation diagnosis predict poor outcome . OUTLINE : Cryopreserved cell sample collect laboratory analysis , include immunoblotting , fluorescence activate cell sorting ( FACS ) , protein analysis .</detailed_description>
