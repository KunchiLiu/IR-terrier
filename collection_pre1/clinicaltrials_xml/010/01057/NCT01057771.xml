	<brief_title>Meditation Exercise Prevention Acute Respiratory Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Background Preliminary evidence suggest meditation exercise may work interact psychological physiological pathway influence immune system reduce infectious respiratory disease . Methods In study , woman men age 50 old randomize : 1 ) 8-week behavioral training program mindfulness meditation , 2 ) intensity , duration location-matched 8-week exercise training program , 3 ) wait list control group . Sample size N=150 enrol , N=50 group . The main patient-oriented outcome severity-adjusted total day acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) illness , self-reported Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey ( WURSS-24 ) , validate questionnaire outcome measure . Nucleic acid base viral identification verify symptomatic infection , cytokine IL-8 nasal neutrophil nasal wash serve biomarkers illness severity . Biomarkers immune function include antibody response influenza immunization ( serum IgG , mucosal IgA ) cytokines IFN-γ IL-10 culture ex vivo lymphocyte . Questionnaire measure assess perceive stress , positive negative emotion , optimism , anxiety analyze potential mediator immunomodulation illness prevention . Timeframe / logistics This 2-year project , 2 cohort conduct single cold season . The first cohort N=60 randomize begin intervention September 2009 . The second cohort N=90 randomize begin intervention January 2010 . Tri-valent influenza vaccination occur week 6 behavioral intervention cohort . Blood antibody titer ex vivo cytokine assay draw baseline , end 8-week session , 3 month later . Nasal swab IgA do time . Participants follow telephone contact every 2 week , monthly questionnaire instrument , daily self-assessments ARI illness episode . Analysis ANOVA-based model assess effect meditation exercise immune marker ARI illness . Psychological measure assess potential mediator effect meditation exercise ARI illness . Generalized estimate equation , random-effects pattern-mixture model , hierarchical linear model use assess longitudinal effect , interaction , covariate mediation . Section 2 . Specific Aims 2.1 . Background Acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) lead cause morbidity mortality . Influenza pathogenic many virus involve , hence merit special attention . Protective ameliorative immune mechanism poorly understood , associate various indicator mental well physical health . A broad literature suggest regular exercise affect immune system , positively influence mental health , protect ARI illness . A separate small body evidence suggest mindfulness meditation may lead low stress level well mental physical health . Published evidence study suggest meditation may enhance antibody ( serum IgG ) response influenza vaccination ( flu shot ) [ 1 ] . 2.2 . Methods &amp; Aims The propose randomized control trial ( RCT ) test effect meditation exercise incidence severity ARI illness 8-month observation period . Participants ( N=150 ) randomize 1 ) 8-week training program mindfulness meditation , 2 ) attention , duration location-matched program moderate intensity exercise , 3 ) wait list control group . Each ARI illness episode assess validated questionnaire outcome instrument , verify nucleic acid base multiplex viral identification system , assessed inflammation IL-8 assay neutrophil count nasal wash. Immunological measure include antibody response flu shot ( serum IgG mucosal IgA ) cytokine indicator TH1 ( IFN-γ ) TH2 ( IL-10 ) immune response , measure stimulate ex vivo lymphocyte cell culture . Psychological domain assess include perceived stress , positive negative emotion , anxiety , optimism . Immune biomarkers psychological domain assess consequence behavioral intervention , predictor ARI illness . Finally , attempt disentangle mediate effect psychological health immune mechanism ARI illness . For example , one hypothesis meditation influence immune system reduction stress-related immune dampen mechanism . That hypothesis would receive support perceive stress ARI illness low meditation group , perceive stress associate strongly immune biomarkers ARI measure measure psychological domain . We expect exercise meditation improve psychological health , influence immune biomarkers , reduce ARI illness burden . However , current evidence sufficient estimate relative magnitude effect , confidently predict whether cellular and/or antibody-mediated immune mechanism implicate . 2.3 Null hypothesis - 2.3.1 Compared control , 8-week training program mindfulness meditation lead statistically significant reduction number severity-weighted day ARI illness . 2.3.2 Compared control , match 8-week exercise training program lead significant reduction ARI illness . 2.3.3 Meditation training enhance either antibody response flu shot ( serum IgG , mucosal IgA ) , cytokine expression link TH1 TH2 cell-mediated immune pathway ( IFN-γ , IL-10 ) . 2.3.4 Exercise training enhance either antibody response flu shot cytokine expression culture lymphocyte . 2.3.5 Mindfulness meditation train lead improvement measure psychological health ( perceived stress , positive negative emotion/affectivity , anxiety , optimism ) . 2.3.6 Exercise training improve psychological measure . 2.3.7 Immune biomarkers predict ARI outcome . 2.3.8 Psychological measure predict ARI outcome . 2.3.9 The effect meditation exercise psychological measure , immune biomarkers , ARI illness distinguishable . 2.3.10 Observed effect meditation exercise ARI outcomes explain either psychological measure biomarkers immune mechanism . 2.4 Justification Influenza acute viral infection responsible tremendous health burden . Antibody-mediated immunity , respond vaccination natural exposure , partially effective conferring protection . Current evidence suggest cell-mediated immune mechanism important process . Both antibody-mediated cell-mediated immune mechanism link psychological domain , appear decline age . Preliminary evidence suggest mindfulness meditation moderate intensity exercise may least partially effective modify immune response reduce infectious illness burden . No study compare 2 quite different behavioral intervention technique . This propose research would provide new knowledge regard effect meditation exercise training ARI illness , immunological psychological pathway involve .</detailed_description>

'' and/or `` On average get least 1 cold per year ? '' 4 ) Selfreported ability willingness follow either exercise meditation training , neither , accord randomize allocation . 5 ) Successful completion task runin period , include 2 inperson appointment , 2 phone contact , 1 set homework questionnaire . 6 ) A score 14 low PHQ9 depression screen , selfreported entrance runin trial prior enrollment main study . 7 ) A score 24 point high Folstein minimental status exam , administer research personnel entrance runin trial prior consent enrollment main study . 1 ) Physical medical condition prohibit adherence study protocol . Prospective participant must meet American Heart Association guidelines225 suitability exercise program . Prospective participant advise ( require ) seek physician ' advice enrollment . 2 ) Current recent use meditative practice , previous meditation training . Assessed answer `` Yes '' follow question : Do meditate regular basis ? In last year , meditate least weekly 2 month row ? Have ever train meditation ? Have ever involve mindfulness class mindfulness practice ? 3 ) Potential participant must engage moderate exercise twice per week vigorous exercise per week , assess follow question adapt BRFSS classification226 system : On average , many time per week engage moderate recreational activity walk , tennis double , ballroom dancing , weight training , similar activity last least 20 minute per occasion ?
