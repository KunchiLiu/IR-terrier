	<detailed_description>Patients primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) show increased morbidity mortality mainly due cardiovascular disease . The precise mechanism cardiovascular disease PHPT well understood probably multifactorial . Functional structural alteration vascular endothelial smooth muscle cell may impair vascular reactivity lead accelerate atherogenesis . Several cardiovascular risk factor obesity , hypertension , insulin resistance hyperlipidemia prevalent PHPT compare controls.Patients severe form PHPT great probability metabolic syndrome ( MS ) insulin resistance patient mild PHPT eucalcemic subject . Although excess cardiovascular mortality significantly independently relate serum calcium , connection biochemical disturbance cardiovascular disorder PHPT patient necessarily cause-and-effect relationship . Indeed , impact surgical cure hyperparathyroidism cardiovascular risk factor mortality controversial . Some study suggest hypertension , dyslipidemia , derangement glucose metabolism improve removal overactive parathyroid tissue . Others show cardiovascular risk marker remain unaltered parathyroidectomy ( PTX ) . The aim study evaluate whether successful PTX associate decrease cardiovascular risk . We investigate index metabolic syndrome insulin resistance well various cardiovascular risk factor patient manifest PHPT one year successful PTX .</detailed_description>
