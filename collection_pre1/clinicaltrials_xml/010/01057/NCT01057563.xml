	<detailed_description>Background . Restenosis due neointimal hyperplasia cause repeat target vessel revascularization relevant number patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Drug-eluting stent ( DES ) currently adopt reduce rate restenosis repeat revascularizations majority case . However , know drawback limit clinical application DES technology possible increase risk stent thrombosis , require need prolong dual antiplatelet therapy . Such phenomenon strongly relate profound inhibition stent strut endothelization , lead presence uncovered stent strut , persistence polymer molecule may induce inflammatory reaction vessel wall . Experimental data first clinical experience show inhibition neointimal hyperplasia may obtain local administration anti-proliferative drug ( like paclitaxel ) load surface angioplasty balloon . Accordingly , drug-eluting balloon ( DEBs ) promise tool prevent restenosis avoid undesiderable persistence polymer molecule DES vessel wall , thus potentially increase safety PCI Data efficacy novel coronary DEBs best technique use lacking . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , resolution 5-10 μm , 10 time high intravascular ultrasound , thus allow fine characterization stent strut coverage apposition detection minimal degree in-stent neointima hyperplasia . Objective study : - To evaluate degree neointimal hyperplasia patient undergo bare-metal stent ( BMS ) implantation alone compare receive additional DEB use . - To assess technique DEB use ( pre-dilation post-dilation ) may affect degree neointimal hyperplasia BMS implantation . Study Design . Open label prospective randomize trial compare degree neointimal hyperplasia assess OCT patient treat BMS implantation alone , BMS implantation DEB predilation BMS follow DEB postdilation . Consecutive patient undergo BMS implantation agree enter study randomize 1:1:1 1 . BMS implantation . 2 . BMS implantation lesion predilation DEB 3 . BMS implantation follow post-dilation DEB . Enrolled patient undergo 6-month follow coronary angiography OCT evaluation stented segment . OCT analysis perform expert OCT analyst ( GF ) blind treatment assignment . Study population . 30 subject . Procedure Description . In eligible patient , PCI BMS implantation perform accord physician standard practice . All patient pre-treated dual antiplatelet therapy . General consideration DEB usage . DEB mainly intend serve drug delivery vessel wall therefore always cover stenotic area well extend pre-treated ( injure ) vessel area include target lesion adjacent ( prox distal ) portion eventually previously cover stent dilate balloon catheter , incidentally intention . DEB length position within target lesion must therefore carefully choose avoid geographic miss DEB extend pre-treated vessel area . 1 . BMS group procedure : - Lesion predilation undersized semi-compliant balloon ( balloon artery ratio : 0.5/1 ) . - BMS implantation ( stent artery ration : 1.1/1 ) . - Post-dilation stented segment non-compliant balloon high pressure ( 16-18 atm ) 2 . PRE-DEB group procedure : 1 . Pre-dilation - Pre-dilatation target lesion undersized semi-compliant standard PTCA balloon ( balloon artery ratio : 0.5/1 ) 2 . DEB dilation : - DEB diameter pressure : nominal DEB diameter must choose guarantee full vessel wall contact pressure close slightly high DEB nominal pressure ( balloon artery ratio : 1/1 ) - DEB length : nominal DEB length must exceed 10 mm ( 5mm per edge ) length stent plan deployed - DEB inflation time : 45 second 3 . BMS implantation 4 . Post-dilation - Post dilatation stented segment must perform non-compliant PTCA balloon - Balloon diameter : nominal PTCA balloon diameter must choose reach balloon stent ratio 1:1 high pressure ( 16-18 atm ) - Balloon length positioning : PTCA balloon length shorter length deploy stent . In case post stent edge residual stenosis post-dilation balloon must fall within outside stent ( 5mm per edge ) previously dilate DEB 3 . POST-DEB group procedure : 1 . Pre-dilation - Pre-dilatation target lesion must perform undersized semi-compliant standard PTCA balloon ( balloon artery ratio : 0.5/1 ) 2 . BMS implantation - stent artery ratio : 1.1/1 - stent length must allow full coverage target lesion single stent well 10 mm short DEB operator planning use next 3 . Post-dilation - Post dilatation stented segment must perform non-compliant PTCA balloon - Balloon diameter : nominal PTCA balloon diameter must choose reach balloon stent ratio 1:1 high pressure ( 16-18 atm ) 4 . DEB-dilation - DEB length positioning : DEB length must 10 mm longer previously deploy stent ( extend pre-treated area case former post-dilation outside stent edge ) centre within pre-treated length ( 5mm per edge ) - DEB inflation time : 45 second - Balloon stent ratio : 1.1:1 pressure close slightly high DEB nominal pressure The result procedure assess 3-dimensional QCA . Post-procedural management . All patient undergo cardiac damage marker ( Creatin-kinase-MB Troponin I ) assessment procedure , 6 hour PCI 24 hour PCI . Thereafter , blood sample perform clinically indicate . After PCI , patient give aspirin ( 75-100 mg/die ) life-long clopidogrel ( 75 mg/die ) 3 month ( accord on-label prescription DEB-treated patient ) . Follow-up . Clinical follow-up take place 1 month ( ±1 week ) , 6 month ( ±2 week ) 1 year ( ±30 day ) . At 6-month follow-up patient undergo quantitative coronary angiography ( 3-dimensional QCA ) Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) study . OCT analysis . OCT perform Imaging system M2 ( LightLab Imaging Inc. , Westford , Massachusetts ) , capable pullback speed 2 mm/sec acquisition frame rate 15.6/sec , use non-occlusive technique , continuous intracoronary iso-osmolar contrast injection . The entire stent length assess cross sectional image analyse every 0.5 mm . STRUT COVERAGE The strut classify uncovered tissue layer endoluminal surface visible cover presence visibile tissue endoluminal surface lumen . The tissue coverage thickness measure strut distance strut endoluminal surface lumen . In cross section analyse , follow parameter calculate : percentage cover strut ( number cover struts/ total number strut ) , percentage uncover strut ( number uncover struts/ total number strut ) , tissue coverage thickness ( μm ) , tissue coverage area ( stent area - lumen area ) percentage ( tissue coverage area/stent area X 100 ) ; tissue volume coverage ( tissue coverage area x stent length ) percentage ( tissue coverage volume/stent volume X 100 ) . To assess pattern coverage , ratio difference maximum minimum tissue thickness/maximum tissue coverage calculate frame . A ratio close 1 indicates asymmetric tissue coverage , opposite ratio close 0 indicate symmetric tissue coverage . INCOMPLETE STENT APPOSITION A single stent strut define incomplete stent apposition ( ISA ) distance endoluminal surface vessel wall high entire strut thickness . ISA consider present least one single strut incompletely appose vessel wall . In OCT frame analyse , number strut ISA maximum distance endoluminal stent strut vessel wall measure . The percentage strut ISA ( number strut ISA/total number strut ) , accord presence/absence tissue coverage , also report . A strut define protrude strut protrude lumen relative intima adjacent strut section distance endoluminal surface vessel wall less entire strut thickness high half strut thickness . The percentage protruding strut ( number protrude struts/total number strut X 100 ) report , accord presence/absence tissue coverage . Sample size calculation statistical analysis . The primary endpoint neointimal area . Secondary endpoint percentage uncover strut , percentage strut ISA percentage protruding strut . This OCT study superiority study expect additional DEB use BMS implantation lead reduction primary endpoint compare BMS implantation alone . Few information available neointimal proliferation BMS implantation : two small non randomize study report maximal minimal neointimal thickness ( mm ) 7.3 month follow ( first study ) mean neointimal thickness 8 month follow ( latter study ) &gt; 4 fold high BMS group compare rapamycin elute stent group , although data neointimal area available . A recent randomized study compare 12 polymer coat rapamycin-eluting stent 12 non polymer rapamycin elute stent report neointimal area 0.3 ± 0.2 mm2 polymer stent v 1.2 ± 0.8 mm2in non polymer stent , thus difference 0.9 ( 95 % CI 0.3-1.4 ) . Based finding , may hypothesize additional DEB use yield value neointimal area close report non polymer rapamycin elute stent would correspond approximately 50 % reduction neointimal area BMS group . To detect difference , 10 patient require group power 0.9 two- side type I error 0.05 . As anticipate whether time additional DEB use : pre post stenting , might different effect reduction neointimal hyperplasia , 10 patient allocate randomized fashion predilatation DEB use group , 10 patient postdilatation DEB use group 10 BMS group .</detailed_description>
