	<criteria>Pathologically ( histologically cytologically ) proven ( primary lesion and/or lymph node ) diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx ; Stage III IV disease . Patients unresectable resection would produce severe impairment disfiguration . Appropriate stage protocol entry , include distant metastasis , base upon follow minimum diagnostic workup : History/physical examination within 4 week prior registration Chest xray ( Chest CT scan PET/CT scan ) within 6 week prior registration . CT scan , Pet CT , MRI head neck ( primary tumor neck node ) . Zubrod Performance Status 01 ; Age &gt; 18 ; Adequate bone marrow function , define ANC &gt; 1,500 cells/ul Platelets &gt; 100,000 cells/ul Hgb &gt; 9mg/dl . Bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit normal , ( For patient Gilbert 's disease sole cause elevate bilirubin , eligible direct bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit normal ) AST ALT &lt; 2.5x upper limit normal . Adequate renal function , define follow : Creatinine clearance ( CC ) ≥ 50 ml/min within 2 week prior registration determine : 24hour collection estimate CockcroftGault formula : CCr male = [ ( 140 age ) x ( wt kg ) ] [ ( Serum Cr mg/dl ) x ( 72 ) ] CCr female = 0.85 x ( CrCl male ) INR PTT &lt; 1.5 x uln . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR &lt; 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose LMW heparin &gt; 2 week prior start treatment . ) Pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration RAD001for woman childbearing potential . Women childbearing potential male participant must agree use medically effective mean birth control throughout participation treatment phase study ( least 60 day follow last study treatment ) ; If barrier contraceptive use , must continue throughout trial sex . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration RAD001 ) Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication value rechecked . EKG within 6 week study entry Signed informed consent Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3years . Patients simultaneous primary bilateral tumor exclude . Patients nasopharyngeal cancer unknown primary exclude . Gross total excision ( e.g. , tonsillectomy ) primary tumor ; however , partial removal tumor alleviate impend airway obstruction make patient ineligible . Prior systemic chemotherapy study cancer ; note prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field . Initial surgical treatment , exclude diagnostic biopsy primary site nodal sample neck disease ; radical modify neck dissection permit . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Current uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , uncontrolled congestive heart failure . Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month ; Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration ; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration define oxygen saturation &lt; 88 % rest room air . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Protocolspecific requirement may also exclude immunocompromised patient . Any uncontrolled condition , opinion investigator , would interfere safe timely completion study procedure ; Pregnant lactate woman woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic . Prior allergic reaction study drug ( ) involve protocol ; Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleed diathesis serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration RAD001 ) Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy etc ) Patients major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week . History noncompliance medical regeimens . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
