	<brief_summary>High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) show increase tracheal mucus clearance compare control group . These observation lead development The Vest® non-stretchable jacket connect air-pulse generator worn patient chest wall . The generator rapidly inflate deflate The Vest® , gently compress release chest wall 5 20 time per second . This generate mini-coughs say dislodge mucus bronchial wall facilitate movement airway . The Vest® show reduce viscosity mucus enhance mucus clearance . People cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , admit hospital acute infective pulmonary exacerbation , increase frequency duration airway clearance session owe increase quantity viscosity purulent bronchial secretions.In United Kingdom , many country , availability physiotherapist assist recommended number daily treatment insufficient meet patient need . If use high frequency chest wall oscillation , addition 'usual ' self airway clearance technique , early morning even facilitate recovery exacerbation , would indicate important place high frequency chest wall oscillation management people cystic fibrosis . Hypothesis : The addition high frequency chest wall oscillation twice daily supervise physiotherapy effective addition self treatment facilitate recovery acute infective pulmonary exacerbation , measure improvement lung function , specifically forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) .</brief_summary>
