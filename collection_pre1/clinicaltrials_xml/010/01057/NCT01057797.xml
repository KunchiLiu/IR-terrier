	<brief_title>Nurse Managed Upper Body Strength Training Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) experience intense symptom dyspnea use arm shoulder . To control dyspnea avoid use arm ultimately experience significant loss upper body ( UB ) strength decrease level physical activity . Some pulmonary rehabilitation program include strength training , train intensity typically low . The purpose research examine effect UB strength training ( design maximize strength gain ) self-confidence intervention enhance adherence exercise . This experimental study random assignment subject one experimental two control group : ( ) UB strength train self-efficacy intervention adherence ( experimental ) , ( b ) UB strength training health education ( control 1 ) ( c ) gentle armchair fitness exercise health education ( control 2 ) . Each subject study total 16 months.The intervention period four month duration 12-month follow-up period . The sample people moderate severe COPD experience dyspnea UB activity . This research innovative examines effect upper body strength training design maximize strength gain combines theory-based self-efficacy ( confidence-building ) intervention promote adherence training people COPD .</detailed_description>
