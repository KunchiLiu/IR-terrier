	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Treating Patients With AIDS-Associated Kaposi 's Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) single agent lenalidomide subject AIDS-related KS . ( Phase I ) II . Evaluate overall clinical response KS tumor lenalidomide subset assessment partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate effect lenalidomide human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) plasma viral load . II . Determine effect lenalidomide T-lymphocyte subset , include natural killer ( NK ) cell . III . Evaluation time response , time relapse , time death amongst subject receive lenalidomide . IV . Determine effect lenalidomide human herpesvirus ( HHV ) -8 . V. Assess lenalidomide effect HHV-8 copy number peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , plasma whether change viral copy number measure PBMC plasma associate clinical response KS tumor . VI . Monitor HHV-8 gene expression KS biopsy specimen PBMC pre- post-lenalidomide ass whether change viral gene expression tumor biopsy associate clinical response . VII . Assess whether change viral copy number compartment assay occur concert independently change viral antigen expression biopsy specimen . VIII . Assess effect lenalidomide growth factor relevant tumor proliferation ( i.e. , interleukin [ IL ] -1beta , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-15 , IL-12p70 , tumour necrosis factor [ TNF ] alpha , interferon gamma [ IFN ] gamma ) . IX . Characterize effect lenalidomide viral cellular gene KS tumor biopsy . X. Assess change NK cell number ( PBMC tumor ) function pre- post-lenalidomide . XI . Assess sensitivity specificity dermal adhesive strip sample detect KS effect lenalidomide lesion . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . This phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
