	<brief_summary>The phosphorus content saliva increase chronic kidney disease . We hypothesize chew gum bind salivary phosphorus would novel , effective agent reduce serum level phosphorus patient chronic kidney disease . We test hypothesis use chew gum call FOSTRAP show effective small , non-randomized study patient chronic kidney disease hemodialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Blind Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial FOSTRAP Chewing Gum Patients With CKD Hyperphosphatemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind , randomize , placebo , control trial open label extension subject end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Patients ESRD randomize receive either FOSTRAP™ 20 mg BID , FOSTRAP™ 40 mg BID match placebo 2x/day . All subject participate 4 week chew period follow 4 week follow period . All subject enter open label 2 week extension phase receive FOSTRAP™ 20 mg TID . Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) dialysis receive either FOSTRAP™ 20 mg 3x/day placebo TID 4 week follow 4 week follow period .</detailed_description>
