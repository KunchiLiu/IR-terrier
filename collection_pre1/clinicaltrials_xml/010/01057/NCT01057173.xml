	<brief_summary>A randomized clinical trial transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) versus conventional surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) patient older 70 year age suffer severe aortic valve stenosis . Study hypothesis : TAVI reduce post-interventional morbidity mortality compare SAVR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) new rapidly evolve treatment option patient severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis . Short- mid-term result transcatheter valve prosthesis promise high-risk surgical patient , long-term result lack . TAVI could potentially attractive minimally invasive treatment also patient moderate low surgical risk , comparison make standard surgical treatment aortic valve stenosis . AIM : To compare TAVI surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) patient severe aortic valve stenosis . POPULATION : All patient severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis refer elective subacute aortic valve intervention screen study eligibility . To included subject must 70 year old , anatomical technical eligible intervention , expect survive 1 year intervention , able provide write informed consent . Study exclusion criterion include isolate aortic valve regurgitation significant valve disease , coronary artery disease require revascularisation time referral , previous open heart surgery , myocardial infarction percutaneous coronary intervention within last year , cerebral infarction within previous 30 day , severe renal - , pulmonary - , infectious disease , unstable preoperative condition . DESIGN : The project national multicenter randomize clinical trial . Patients fulfil inclusion- exclusion criterion randomize either TAVI SAVR . Randomization 1:1 140 subject group stratify accord centre , age ( 70-74 year v 75 old ) , coronary co-morbidity require revascularisation ( yes v ) . Primary outcome assess blind adjudication committee . Patients screen include study follow yearly . Screening inclusion commence December 2009 . Inclusion expect last 2 3 year , subject follow 10 year . INTERVENTIONS : Subjects randomize TAVI undergo percutaneous retrograde trans-femoral trans-subclavian aortic valve implantation Medtronic CoreValve ( TM ) self-expandable bio-prosthesis . Before implantation balloon dilatation aortic annulus perform . Subjects randomize SAVR undergo conventional surgical aortic valve replacement bio-prosthesis cardiopulmonary bypass normothermia cold cardioplegia cardiac arrest . All intervention perform general anaesthesia , post-interventional medical anticoagulation treatment uniform . END POINTS : The primary end point combine outcome measure consist death cause , myocardial infarction , stroke one year intervention . Secondary end point death cause , cardiac death , cardiac - , cerebral - , pulmonary - , renal complication , prosthesis re-intervention , procedure success - time , admission length , functional class , quality life , prosthesis leave ventricular structure function . Follow-up visit perform 30 day , 3 , 6 12 month , yearly thereafter minimum 10 year .</detailed_description>
