	<brief_summary>People establish cardiovascular disease need secondary prevention address multiple risk factor . Complexity &amp; cost confer particularly difficult barrier uptake treatment ; recovery stroke heart attack typically necessitate multiple drug cholesterol , blood pressure platelet function . A low-cost , fixed-dose , once-daily combination polypill , Red Heart Pill , formulate Dr Reddy 's Laboratories . UMPIRE evaluate whether provision polypill compare usual medication improve adherence clinical outcome among high-risk patient Europe India . The result use develop recommendation equitable access .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UMPIRE - Use Multidrug Pill In Reducing Cardiovascular Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The UMPIRE trial model similar trial run concurrently Australia New Zealand . The design straight forward make comparison cardiovascular preventative therapy deliver polypill ( Red Heart Pill ) one hand , separate component multiple tablet ( usual care ) hand . In group ( polypill group usual care group , ) GP manage physician able adjust add additional medication appropriate meet target control blood pressure , cholesterol risk factor direct local national guideline . The Primary endpoint - adherence prescribe cardiovascular preventative medication end trial follow-up - evaluate self report use anti-platelet , statin blood pressure lower therapy . This evaluation support record blood pressure cholesterol level , measure difference two group end trial . Treatment allocation open label - investigator subject know arm study . Patients identify recruited GP surgery hospital clinic , also via local advertisement . Recruitment study plan start Summer 2010 12 month recruitment phase . Recruited subject spend 12 - 30 month ( average 18 month ) follow . The target study population 1000 patient European site London , Dublin Utrecht ; 1000 subject India approximately 30 site . Subjects randomly allocate receive either `` polypill '' `` usual care '' . If allocate polypill group , study investigator decide version polypill prescribe , adjust current medication necessary . If subject `` usual care '' group , see need usual doctor study visit , continue current medicine . Participants least 5 study visit , 8 study visit , visit include registration , randomisation follow-up visit 1 month , 6 month , 12 month , depend subject recruit study , study visit 18 24 months/end trial visit . A substudy , PESCA ( Protocol ID CR01656 , NCT01326676 ) , perform European participant ass whether polypill reduces progression atherosclerosis . This assess measure carotid intima-medial thickness central systolic blood pressure use PulseCor device . A second substudy , INPUT , process evaluation involve qualitative interview sample health practitioner trial participant end trial ( summer 2012 ) London India .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults ( ≥ 18 year ) The participant able give inform consent . Established atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) high cardiovascular risk , individual without establish cardiovascular disease , calculate 5 year CVD risk 15 % great ( calculate use 1991 Anderson Framingham risk equation adjustment define New Zealand Guidelines Group recommendation ) The trial Investigator considers polypill component indicate The trial Investigator unsure whether polypillbased strategy usual care well . Contraindication component polypill ( e.g . know intolerance aspirin , statin , ACE inhibitor , pregnancy likely become pregnant treatment period ) . The treat doctor considers change participant 's cardiovascular medication would put participant risk ( e.g . symptomatic heart failure , high dose βblocker require manage angina rate control atrial fibrillation , accelerate hypertension , severe renal insufficiency , history severe resistant hypertension ) Known situation medication regimen might alter significant length time , e.g . current acute cardiovascular event , plan coronary bypass graft operation . Unlikely complete trial ( e.g . lifethreatening condition cardiovascular disease ) adhere trial procedure attend study visit ( e.g . major psychiatric condition , dementia ) .</criteria>
