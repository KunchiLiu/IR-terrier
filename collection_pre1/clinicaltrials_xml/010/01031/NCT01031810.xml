	<brief_summary>The primary objective study test whether brain Mono Amine Oxidase-A ( MAO-A ) level elevate patient treatment-resistant major depression , explore whether MAO-A brain level predict treatment outcome Mono Amine Oxidase Inhibitor ( MAOI ) medication population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Biomarkers Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) prevalent disabling , compel recent data Sequenced Treatment Alternatives Relieve Depression ( STAR*D ) study indicate half patient attain remission MDD , even multiple antidepressant medication trial . Further , biomarker validate select effective treatment patient , present critical unmet intellectual clinical challenge . The recent landmark find markedly elevate level monoamine oxidase A ( MAO-A ) brain depress patient MDD compare control , use positron emission tomography ( PET ) positron-emitting carbon isotope , ( carbon 11 [ 11C ] ) label monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) , provide unparalleled opportunity address challenge . It long know MAOIs effective patient treatment-resistant MDD , although side effect profile make highly unacceptable patient physician , severely curtail utility . This study seek : 1 ) replicate study use PET scan 20 subject MDD extend patient treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) . ( Results participant compare 10 non-depressed control ; 2 ) explore correlation brain MAO-A level biomarker treatment outcome treat 20 PET-imaged TRD patient MAOI , hypothesize MAOI response relate level MAO-A . Brain MAO-A ideal candidate biomarker study since appear significantly abnormally elevate MDD , yet broad range value even among depressed patient . Most importantly , MAO-A biomarker know single pharmacologic target treatment , make appear likely outcome MAOI treatment related MAO-A .</detailed_description>
