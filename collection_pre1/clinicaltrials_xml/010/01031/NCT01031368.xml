	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study safety potential efficacy infuse non-human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) match ex vivo expand cord blood progenitor follow treatment clofarabine cytarabine patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . The combination clofarabine , cytarabine ( Ara-C ) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) test early study treatment acute myeloid leukemia . In previous clinical trial , combination drug show anti-leukemia effect . However , combination clofarabine Ara-C profoundly myelosuppressive immunosuppressive causing period neutropenia potentially lasting three week . During period , patient increase risk infection result increase risk death . G-CSF growth factor use help white blood cell recover quickly , even G-CSF , use clofarabine Ara-C often limit need take long break treatment allow blood count recover . In lab develop method grow `` expand '' blood stem cell ( cell give rise blood system ) umbilical cord blood . We study find give expanded cell chemotherapy safe , help blood system recover quickly chemotherapy allow short break treatment , decrease risk infection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine , Cytarabine , Filgrastim Followed Infusion Non-HLA Matched Ex Vivo Expanded Cord Blood Progenitors Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety infuse off-the-shelf non-HLA matched expand cord blood cell follow administration cytarabine hydrochloride ( GCLAC ) patient AML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess ability product provide temporary myeloid engraftment . II . Assess kinetics/persistence potential engraftment . III . Assess kinetics autologous recovery compare historical cohort . IV . Assess development alloimmunization . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive clofarabine intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour cytarabine hydrochloride IV 2 hour day 1-5 . Patients receive infusion non-HLA match ex vivo expand cord blood progenitor day 6 . Filgrastim ( G-CSF ) administer subcutaneously ( SC ) day 0-5 day 7 blood count recover . Treatment modification may apply accord response . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive clofarabine IV 1 hour cytarabine hydrochloride IV 2 hour day 1-5 . Patients also receive G-CSF SC begin day 0 continue blood count recover . Patients may receive treatment 1-4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
