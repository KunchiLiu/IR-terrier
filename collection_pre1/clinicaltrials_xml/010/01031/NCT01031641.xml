	<brief_summary>Background : - Currently , National Cancer Institute treatment trial use clinical staff report monitor adverse side effect . The clinical staff report draw item Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . - Several item CTCAE adapt use patient self-reporting side effect . Researchers interested develop patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) approach CTCAE . Objectives : - To develop question use create patient-reported outcome version CTCAE ( PRO-CTCAE ) . - To evaluate patient comprehension test usefulness PRO-CTCAE question among diverse group patient . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old receive chemotherapy radiotherapy cancer treatment . - Participants must able speak understand English . Design : - Researchers conduct three round interviews patient currently receive chemotherapy radiation therapy treatment cancer . - Participants recruit independently four different clinical treatment site . At least 25 percent patient educational attainment high school less . - Each patient complete two-part protocol , include set PROs follow series question evaluate patient comprehension , memory , perceive clarity , judgment PROs . - The research complete approximately 1 hour , participant receive small amount compensation time participation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Refinement Patient-Reported Outcomes Version Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( PRO-CTCAE ) Via Cognitive Interviewing Usability Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The current approach monitoring adverse symptom event NCI-sponsored treatment trial clinical staff reporting , use item Common Terminology Criteria Averse Events ( CTCAE ) . Of 1,059 discrete item CTCAE , approximately 77 contain subjective component sufficient enough amenable patient self-reporting pain , fatigue , nausea , hair loss . There general agreement patient , via self-report , best source reporting symptom . Studies show compare clinician report , patient report early onset , great severity , long duration symptom . In September 2008 , NCI award contract ( N02-PC-85002-29 ; PI : Basch ; Co-I : Hay ) support development electronic-based psychometrically robust patient-reported outcome version symptom-related AEs list CTCAE effort improve accuracy precision grade class AEs . To achieve goal , conduct cognitive interview 77 newly-developed PRO item subsequently subject psychometric analysis , usability testing , feasibility test range treatment setting among diverse group patient . Objectives : The overall goal propose study evaluate patient comprehension 77 newly develop PRO item range treatment setting among diverse group cancer patient . The objective evaluate : 1 ) patient understanding language 2 ) usability technology interface collect PRO data PRO-CTCAE system . Eligibility : Patients eligible study 1 ) age 18 old ; 2 ) English-fluent ; 3 ) undergo chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy curative palliative intent ; 4 ) provide inform consent . Design : We conduct three round cognitive interview 100 cancer patient participate cancer center include MSKCC , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Duke M.D . Anderson . After completion first round interview , result analyze problematic item . Revised item review subsequent round need . The final PRO-CTCAE item proceed usability testing . Usability test comprise three main component : 1 ) observation user interact web-based assessment system couple think aloud protocol extensive field note ; 2 ) user feedback use semi-structured interview short survey ; 3 ) web analytics include track different web page , clickstream analysis . Usability test conduct 60 clinical research staff 60 patient .</detailed_description>
