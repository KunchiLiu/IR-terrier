	<brief_summary>Previous work demonstrate inhaled hypertonic saline ( HS ) reduce exacerbation frequency improve lung function adult cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . It unclear , however , whether HS benefit young patient suffer CF . The investigator propose support concept HS benefit child mild CF lung disease perform relatively short , placebo control study HS 5-12 year old , use lung function mucociliary clearance key outcome measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Hypertonic Saline Mucus Clearance Children Ages 5-12 With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our current understanding pathogenesis CF lung disease stem data demonstrate presence airway surface liquid ( ASL ) dehydration CF . ASL dehydration CF cause defective chloride secretion cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) increase sodium reabsorption epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) . ASL dehydration , turn , interfere mucociliary clearance apparatus , cause breach critical line lung host defense . A number novel therapeutic develop address basic defect disease , include use inhale hypertonic saline . Previous work demonstrate inhaled hypertonic saline ( HS ) reduce exacerbation frequency improve lung function patient clinically apparent lung disease . A number issue revolve around use HS CF remain unresolved . First , typical patient enrol previous study adult ( mean age = 26 yr ) establish lung disease ( mean FEV1=78 % ) . Despite hypothesis HS positively affect MCC preserved/normal airway , common view HS benefit CF patient induce cough transiently promote clearance thick CF secretion . It question , therefore , whether HS benefit patient young mild ( undetectable ) lung disease potentially normal ( though unmeasured ) rate MCC . Second , unclear whether substantial beneficial effect HS CF achieve long ( &gt; 4 hour ) duration action spite extremely short ( ~45 minute ) duration action ( traditional view base upon experiment normal epithelium ) . This issue important , relate development dose hydrator therapy may different pharmacodynamic profile . Certainly , twice daily dose short act compound sufficient provide significant clinical benefit , would reduce challenge drug discovery CF ease treatment burden impose upon patient . The study HS CF provide u opportunity address issue . The hypothesis test HS rehydrate CF airway secretion , produce sustain acceleration MCC young child CF , regardless whether measurable mucus clearance defect exist relatively early stage disease . We predict substantial acceleration MCC reduce exacerbation rate young child CF . In addition , grow number treatment modality prescribe patient CF , adherence complex time consume medical regimen become increasingly problematic important . We therefore , wish test improve drug delivery platform HS- eFlow ( Pari Pharma ) vibrate mesh nebulizer , potential reduce treatment time , improve compliance , increase treatment efficacy .</detailed_description>
