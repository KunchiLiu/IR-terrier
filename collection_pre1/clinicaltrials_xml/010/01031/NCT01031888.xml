	<brief_summary>Topical insulin application prove recently increase corneal reepithelization rate diabetic animal . However , effectiveness corneal epithelial wound healing patient receive par planar vitrectomy ( PPV ) diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty report . In study , plan perform prospective randomize study determine effectiveness topical insulin primary treatment corneal epithelial defect patient undergo vitrectomy diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty . All patient enrol study receive corneal epithelial debridement end ocular surgery , namely PPV diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty . The patient randomize two treatment group . In control group , patient receive conventional postoperative eye drop include topical steroid , antibiotic mydriatic . In experimental group , patient receive topical insulin eye drop addition conventional postoperative eye drop . The duration corneal surface completely re-epithelize , incidence corneal complication due delay surface re-epithelization ( e.g . infectious corneal ulcer , corneal melting , sterile corneal ulcer , corneal neovascularization ) , incidence recurrent epithelial break initial epithelization compare two group . Patients undergo PPV diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty compare separately .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate treatment effect topical insulin eye drop promote corneal epithelium wound heal patient receive par planar vitrectomy ( PPV ) diabetic retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty . Background : During PPV diabetic retinopathy retinopathy penetrate keratoplasty , removal edematous corneal epithelial layer usually require order obtain good surgical view1 enhance postoperative epithelial wound heal process . However , delay epithelial healing frequently find patient surgery . In addition , corneal epithelial defect also frequent find diabetic patient PPV even corneal epithelial debridement perform operation . Topical insulin application know increase corneal reepithelization rate diabetic animal , know influence systemic glucose level human animal . In study , plan perform prospective randomize study determine effectiveness topical insulin eye drop primary treatment corneal epithelial defect follow vitrectomy diabetic patient penetrate keratoplasty .</detailed_description>
