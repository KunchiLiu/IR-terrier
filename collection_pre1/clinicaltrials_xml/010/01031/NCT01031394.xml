	<detailed_description>Frequency aerobic/resistance training old woman Abstract Combined aerobic resistance training unique benefit maintain physical activity ( PA ) . However , optimal training program combine two mode train old adult unknown . This study build current past study show training induced gain aerobic fitness , muscle strength , ease PA important maintain active lifestyle , favorable body composition , high bone density . Traditionally 3 d/wk combine train felt optimal recent study suggest 1 d/wk combine training may create similar adaptation frequent training . However , previous ongoing study suggest 1 d/wk combine aerobic resistance training ( C1 ) may insufficient stimulus induce optimal adaptation 3 d/wk combine training ( C3 ) may frequent stimulus old adult . This study enable u compare effect C1 , 2 d/wk combine training ( C2 ) , C3 fitness , body composition , ease PA , PA , total free-living energy expenditure ( TEE ) . We hypothesize C2 result large increase muscle size , bone density , strength , aerobic capacity , power , ease PA , PA , TEE either C1 C3 . Circulating cytokine psychological mood state link chronic overstress also examine . Objectives : We examine change circulate cytokine , mood state , muscle size , bone density , aerobic capacity , strength , power , ease PA , PA , TEE follow 16 32 wks training . Design : We evaluate 78 ( &gt; 60 yr ) Black White woman match age , race , BMI C1 , C2 , C3 group prior , 16 , 32 wks training . Women undergo evaluation metabolic parameter General Clinical Research Center . Significance : This study provide insight effect combine train frequency improve fitness , ease PA , maintenance high TEE . Such information critical understanding way improve well , quality life , independence age population .</detailed_description>
