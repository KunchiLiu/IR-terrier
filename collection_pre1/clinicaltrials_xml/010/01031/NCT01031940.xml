	<brief_summary>It essential anaesthetist successfully perform orotracheal intubation scenario intubation potentially difficult , anatomical characteristic predictive difficult intubation present . The CMAC® Laryngoscope new intubate device . It design provide view glottis without alignment oral , pharyngeal tracheal ax . The CMAC may especially effective situation intubation trachea potentially difficult . The efficacy device comparison traditional Macintosh laryngoscope novel laryngoscopes know . We aim compare performance Macintosh laryngoscope , gold standard device , patient one anatomical characteristic predictive difficult intubation . The investigator aim compare Airtraq® device device show superior Macintosh laryngoscope previous trial . The investigator primary hypothesis , hand experience anaesthetist , time intubation would shorter use CMAC use Macintosh laryngoscope patient two anatomical characteristic predictive difficult intubation . The investigator hypothesize Airtraq® superior CMAC® one anatomical characteristic predictive difficult intubation .</brief_summary>
