	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Urethral Cancer Bladder Cancer That Has Relapsed Not Responded Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate activity daily oral dos pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy patient relapsed/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma transitional cell tumor . Secondary - To evaluate safety tolerability pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy population chemotherapy pretreated patient . - To assess progression-free survival patient . Tertiary - To evaluate ability whole-body 18FDG-PET image metastasis monitor tumor response determine rate concordance CT image RECIST response criterion . - To evaluate relationship exist tumor response measure 18FDG-PET progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo whole-body 18FDG-PET baseline periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
