	<brief_title>Contrast-free Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) 3.0 T Intracranial Aneurysm Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent year , three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA ( 3D-TOF-MRA ) become useful , contrast-free method observe intracranial vessel widely utilized screen examination intracranial aneurysm . The study available Medline show mixed results.Some study include MRI/MRA analysis , high rate false-positives unreliable , lack control ( rupture aneurysm ) , precise number false-positive result , standard image process review , corroborative IADSA patient . Furthermore , previous study include small sample size aneurysm detection 0.5-T 1.5-T MR . Thus , result inconclusive certain pitfall study . Since 2007 , conduct clinical study objective detection intracranial aneurysm routine diagnostic work-up intracranial aneurysm neuroradiologists use standard procedure 3D-TOF-MRA VR 3T . The investigator want establish quality data prospectively compare 3D-TOF-MRA VR 3T v 3D-RDSA diagnosis intracranial aneurysms large cohort patient test accuracy screening suspect patient</detailed_description>
