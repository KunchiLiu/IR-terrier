	<brief_summary>The purpose research project determine effect drug call bethanechol swallow function patient Ineffective Esophageal Motility ( IEM ) . This drug FDA approve use treat condition , treatment IEM . There currently approve therapy treatment IEM . This information important possible development new way treat patient IEM effectiveness topically applied Bethanechol patient IEM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Bethanechol Improvement Esophageal Dysmotility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study , necessarily expect achieve statistical significance . A control group use , owe pilot nature study . Previous study demonstrate safety oral bethanechol . It show efficacy treatment gastroesophageal reflux adult children1-8 , extensive preclinical data suggest beneficial effect patient IEM9-14 . A single study15 oral bethanechol patient IEM demonstrate significant improvement distal esophageal muscle contraction bolus transit . This study , however measure esophageal function use inferior method manometry . The propose study use high-resolution manometry measure effect oral bethanechol patient IEM , yield improve understanding change esophageal function real-time . The study intervention ( oral bethanechol ) single-dose event ( apply two encounter ) , ongoing treatment intervention . We evaluate effect topically apply bethanechol esophageal motility cohort ( n=20 ) patient IEM . Presence IEM define use current criterion : esophageal contraction amplitude &lt; 30 mmHg either 5 10 cm low esophageal sphincter , 50 % saline swallows15 , 16 . We perform high-resolution manometry ( HRM ) establish baseline patient . HRM part cutting-edge technology available Medical College Georgia Center Voice Swallowing Disorders ( CVSD , part Department Otolaryngology ) , use clinical evaluation patient dysphagia routine basis . Many patient IEM refer CVSD undergo high-resolution manometry course evaluation treatment , regardless inclusion study . The test consist placement manometry catheter nasal cavity esophagus , much naso-gastric tube would place . After confirm proper placement catheter manometry , patient ask perform 10 swallow teaspoon ( 5ml ) water . The muscle contraction esophagus , include upper low esophageal sphincter , record real-time along entire length catheter duration swallow . This allow measurement analysis isolate contraction event , also entire swallow propagates esophagus . Following establishment baseline esophageal function , patient give either 5 mg ( first phase ) 10 mg ( second phase ) bethanechol 1 ml solution contain absorption enhancer . Administration perform throat spray device . The composition delivery solution proprietary . Since bethanechol quaternary amine know less 1 % topical absorbance , absorption enhancer necessary aid process . The choice appropriate FDA approve absorption enhancer make preparation unique . The preparation also contain thicken agent allow remain sprayed enhance absorption . After wait 10 minute , patient undergo post-treatment HRM establish treatment effect . The manometry catheter leave place entire encounter , thus require single placement catheter per session . Two session require establish dose escalation effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any adult patient treat Medical College Georgia , severe IEM define use current criterion : esophageal contraction amplitude &lt; 30 mmHg either 5 10 cm low esophageal sphincter , 50 % saline swallow . Patients severe comorbidities ( include uncontrolled hypertension , severe coronary artery disease , uncontrolled diabetes ) specifically exclude study . Additionally , use bethanechol ( well muscarinic receptor agonist ) contraindicate patient asthma , coronary insufficiency , peptic ulcer , Parkinson 's disease , seizure disorder , recent gastrointestinal surgery , hyperthyroidism . As patient disorder specifically exclude study . Women childbearing age also specifically exclude ( Bethanechol list pregnancy class C drug ) .</criteria>
