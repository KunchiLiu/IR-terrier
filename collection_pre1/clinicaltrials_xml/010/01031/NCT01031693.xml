	<brief_summary>Background : - Treatment nicotine addiction characterize high rate relapse . New treatment therapy nicotine addiction explore use brain scanning equipment control decrease nicotine cigarette craving . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use magnetic pulse stimulate brain . These pulse change activity part brain . Researchers interested determine whether TMS deliver single pulse decrease activity part brain respond nicotine craving . Objectives : - To determine whether single pulse TMS reduce cue-induced nicotine craving use cigarette smoker . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old physically healthy smoke 10 cigarette per day least 1 year . - A small group healthy nonsmoking control subject 18 year age old also participate study . Design : - The study involve seven study visit two follow-up visit . The control participants two visit : one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan one TMS evaluate brain function response . - Participants initial assessment tobacco use habit crave pattern , provide blood urine sample begin study . - Participants two initial MRI brain scan . The first scan look structure brain rest . During scan , participant look image relate related cigarette smoking . - The single pulse TMS session ( either actual TMS inactive [ sham ] TMS ) hold daily 5 consecutive day . Magnetic pulse trigger cigarette-related picture cue deliver vary interval participant see cigarette-related picture . During test visit , researcher ask question related tobacco use craving , collect urine breath sample study . - Participants two follow-up visit , 1 week 2 week TMS session , evaluate memory mood , one final MRI brain scan end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Nicotine Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) provide non-invasive mean inhibit brain neural activity . This pilot study test whether 5 day single pulse ( sp ) TMS reduce cue-induced nicotine craving use cigarette smoker . Hypothesis : We predict active spTMS significantly low crave nicotine compare sham spTMS . Study population : Subjects 73 adult cigarette smoker ( average great equal 10 cigarette daily great equal one year ) current nicotine dependence ( base DSM-IV criterion Faerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence score great equal 3 ) . Subjects current major psychiatric disorder substance abuse . Subjects pilot phase ( one fMRI one TMS session valid brain mapping procedure ) 25 healthy non-smokers . Design : Following baseline day evaluate subject characteristic , subject randomly assign receive 5 day active sham spTMS session . spTMS strength 120 percent motor threshold applied prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) use figure-eight coil . Magnetic pulse trigger cigarette-related pictorial cue deliver vary interval prior presentation cigarette-related picture . TMS pulse deliver emotionally salient image unrelated nicotine emotionally neutral image . Brain site localization use computerize navigation system base functional structural MRI scan obtain first session . Each session ( last around 20 minute ) consist 108 trial ( cue presentation ) : 72 nicotine-associated cue 18 non-drug-associated positive neutral cue . Subjects return follow-up fMRI behavioral assessment one two week final TMS session . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure nicotine crave assessed Tobacco Craving Questionnaire visual analog scale every TMS session one- two-week follow-up . Secondary outcome measure include cigarette smoke test period follow-up assess self-report , salivary cotinine level , expire breath CO level . A follow-up fMRI evaluate change regional brain activity associate change crave TMS treatment . Benefits : Participants directly benefit study . This study may contribute good scientific understanding nicotine addiction development well treatment method . Risks : The primary risk TMS transient headache , scalp discomfort , hear loss ( minimize wear ear plug ) . Seizures rare spTMS administer within accept safety guideline individual increase risk seizure exclude . By exclude individual history non-drug-induced mania/ hypomania minimize risk induce manic episode .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ) Eighteen year age old ii ) Current nicotine dependence ( DSMIV criterion Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence score great equal 3 ) average smoke 10 cigarette per day least one year . iii ) Reading level least 6th grade , base Wide Range Achievement Test ( WRAT ) iv ) Ability give valid inform consent v ) Righthanded vi ) If subject female , childbearing potential , sexually active , agree use medically acceptable contraception , become pregnant duration study . A woman consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal surgically sterilize . Female patient childbearing potential anticipate possibility become sexually active male partner must use either : ( 1 ) contraceptive pill IUD depot hormonal preparation ( ring , injection implant ) ; and/or ( 2 ) barrier method contraception diaphragm , sponge spermicide , condom .
