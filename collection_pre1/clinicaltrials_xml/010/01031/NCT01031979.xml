	<brief_summary>The propose study three distinct relate research objective . The first goal measure physiological correlate successful treatment Prolonged Exposure ( PE ) therapy posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) veterans Iraq Afghanistan war . Individuals PTSD often experience elevated heart rate objectively measurable sign anxiety confront safe situation remind past dangerous situation . We measure physiological response compare outcomes patient 's self report subjective account symptom improvement traditional measure PTSD . Developing way measure objective gain symptom improvement may help researcher study way improve PTSD treatment . The second goal study investigate yohimbine , drug find promote specific type learning , improve treatment outcome veteran PTSD treatment . The third goal investigate ability get use loud startle audio tone correlate baseline PTSD pathology treatment outcomes PE . This goal represent important step forward understand characteristic heritable trait relate PTSD . It significant research may one day lead development individual responder policy assist patient individualize treatment plan base personal characteristic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolonged Exposure Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) With/Without Yohimbine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study three distinct relate research objective . The first research goal measure psychophysiological correlate treatment gain associate Prolonged Exposure ( PE ) therapy PTSD veteran Operations Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) . Specifically , heart rate , heart rate variability , skin conductance , facial electromyography , record treatment three minute anxiety probe specific patient 's index trauma . These measure compare patient 's self report subjective account symptom improvement traditional measure PTSD pathology ( Subjective Units Distress ( SUDs ) , PTSD Checklist-Military Version ( PCL ) , Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) ) . This goal significant veteran currently widely use objective criterion exist measure treatment progress PTSD . While preponderance exist evidence suggest one objective psychophysiological measurement valid correlate individual , even establish measurement paradigm show mean difference group provide researcher objective tool measure outcomes clinical trial . The second goal study investigate administration yohimbine , drug find promote extinction condition fear animal model , recently , human claustrophobia , improve facilitation fear extinction PE . Yohimbine safe drug already extensively use human population . Specifically , goal investigate use double blind placebo control randomized trial design . The hypothesis one 21mg oral dose yohimbine give concurrently 40 minute imaginal exposure exercise PE lead great reduction cue-induced anxiety follow weekly PE session placebo . This goal significant current projection PTSD OEF/OIF veteran indicate need psychological service likely outpace supply service . Accordingly , assist treatment efficient likely translate veteran receive much need mental health service . The 3rd goal investigate ability habituate loud , 95db , audio tone correlate baseline PTSD pathology treatment outcomes PE . This goal represent important step forward understand characteristic trait habituation , fear extinction , learn human , factor relate successful treatment PTSD . It also significant research may lead development individual responder policy assist veteran individualize treatment plan base personal characteristic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must competent provide inform consent research participation . Subjects must male veteran post deploy active duty male personnel OEF/OIF . Subjects must age 18 45 . Subjects must meet DSMIV diagnostic criterion PTSD CAPS . For subject take SSRI 's , subject must stabilize current prescribe dose period least 14 day prior trial remain dose remainder study . Subjects change SSRI status dosage study continue receive service via study resource data generate used analysis . Subjects eligible study willing titrate potentially confound agent prior yohimbine administration ( period five halflives ) , give titration also clinically appropriate deem patient 's best interest . Subjects recent ( &lt; 2 month ) history psychiatric hospitalization suicide attempt . Recent work veteran severe mental illness suggest 2month period stabilization sufficient minimize risk possible relapse ( Frueh , 2005 ) . Subjects exist diagnosis schizophrenia Axis I serious mental illness ( SMI , besides PTSD ) exclude . SMI include severe persistent mental illness . Subjects current diagnosis drug dependence , due potential interaction study measurement treatment . Alcohol use disorder allow give subject pass exclusion criterion 12 without withdrawal symptom . Subjects acute illness fever . Individuals otherwise meet study criterion reschedule evaluation participation . Subjects evidence history clinically significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , hepatic , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect physiological/subjective response . Subjects SCIDdiagnosed panic disorder , yohimbine may precipitate panic attack . Subjects abnormal ECG . Subjects blood pressure 140/90 high , yohimbine show elevate blood pressure . Subjects take Beta blocker , alphaadrenergic agent , Betaagonist inhaler , opiate opiate antagonist psychotropic medication SSRI 's may affect test response . Subjects unwilling unable maintain abstinence three day prior yohimbine administration overthecounter drug sympathomimetic property , e.g. , asthma medication , cold medicine ephedrine , dietary supplement ephedrine alkaloid , illegal drug , e.g. , amphetamine , methamphetamine , cocaine , MNDA well alcohol may exacerbate action yohimbine . Subjects take alphaadrenergic antagonist , e.g . prazosin hypertension ; betaadrenergic antagonist , e.g . propranolol . Because may attenuate effect yohimbine . Subjects eligible study willing titrate potentially confound agent prior yohimbine administration ( period five halflives ) , give titration also clinically appropriate deem patient 's best interest . Asthmatic subject subject medication hypertension , due criterion 9 10 . These inclusion/exclusion criterion allow majority veteran treat PCT study eligible . Accordingly , sample likely generalizable population interest .</criteria>
