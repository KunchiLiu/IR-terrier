	<brief_title>Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine Treating Patients With Nausea Vomiting Caused By Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate efficacy safety fosaprepitant dimeglumine patient breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( CINV ) fail prophylactic antiemetic therapy . Secondary - To evaluate toxicity serious adverse event associate regimen patient . - To evaluate ability patient tolerate oral intake . - To evaluate health-related quality life patient treat regimen . - To evaluate specific side effect associate regimen , include pain sensation and/or soreness infusion site , headache , dizziness , somnolence , patient . - To refine study design future phase II III study rescue therapy breakthrough CINV use various secondary endpoint . OUTLINE : Patients receive chemotherapy combination pre-defined standard 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 ( 5-HT3 ) antagonist corticosteroid regimen without benzodiazepine day 1 . If breakthrough nausea vomit occurs , patient receive fosaprepitant dimeglumine IV per standard administration guideline . Patients treatment response may receive additional dos oral aprepitant day 2 3 . Patients persistent nausea/vomiting 2 hour desire treatment may receive standard rescue therapy prochlorperazine , metoclopramide , haloperidol without additional lorazepam relief , discretion provider . Patients complete diary baseline , 2 , 12 , 24 hour include Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) nausea ; VAS sedation ; question emesis retch frequency , headache , dizziness , somnolence , ability take food liquid orally . Patients also complete Functional Living Index-Emesis Quality Life survey baseline 24 hour .</detailed_description>
