	<brief_summary>Background : - Infection tick-borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) significant health concern human Europe Asia . A vaccine available region Canada , United States . Research study Europe show vaccine effective preventing infection among general population , disease transmit either bite infected tick ( common ) ingestion contaminate unpasteurized milk milk product . Persons work virus research setting , however , potential expose unnatural way , may come contact concentration virus high find naturally tick . - The Food Drug Administration investigate effectiveness exist vaccine . It kill vaccine , mean treated ensure contain live agent ( bacteria virus ) . The manufacturer test product possible contaminating agent none detect . However , unknown small risk exposure undetected contaminate agent vaccine . Objectives : - To test safety immune response vaccine tick-borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) . - To add level protection person may occupational exposure TBEV reduce chance develop infection exposure . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old generally good health potential occupational exposure TBEV one two National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases campuses . Design : - Subjects receive full series vaccine receive least three dos injection upper arm . The first third dose study vaccine give muscle nondominant arm . The second dose give dominant arm . - Participation include least 12 schedule visit study center approximately 3.5 year . - An initial visit take place 7 21 day prior first injection . Blood sample take test liver kidney function , baseline antibody level , possible pregnancy female participant . - Doses give day 0 , 14 , 161 . Participants ask complete diary card day one week follow vaccination assess reaction side effect . At visit receipt vaccine , participant ask side effect . - Blood drawn 14 day second injection 21 day third injection order measure level antibody overall response vaccine . - Subjects develop sufficiently high level antibody may ( discretion laboratory chief ) allow work strain TBEV Biosafety Level ( BSL ) 3 rather BSL-4 . Blood drawn annually 3 year determine antibody level response vaccine . Booster dose provide require .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II , Open Label Trial Vaccine ( FSME-IMMUN 0.5 mL ) Against Tick-borne Encephalitis ( TBE ) NIAID Workers Manipulating Tick Borne Encephalitis Virus ( TBEV ) Laboratory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label trial non-US licensed vaccine tick-borne encephalitis . The vaccine license Baxter , follow acquisition Pfizer Inc Vienna , Austria since 2001 , extensive safety record multiple European country . Field effectiveness study suggest &gt; 99 percent protection disease transmit natural route either tick bite ingestion contaminate , unpasteurized milk . The vaccine also consider effective laboratory exposure use routinely purpose European laboratory . The US Centers Disease Control Prevention National Institutes Health acknowledge effectiveness vaccine allow receive study tick-borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) isolation facility rat BSL-3 rather stringent BSL-4 , exception Russian Spring-Summer Encephalitis strain . Subjects personnel 2 intramural campus National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases may expose accidentally strain serotype viable TBEV . Approximately 160 individual eligible participate . Inclusion exclusion criterion define . The rapid immunization schedule ( injection Days 0 , 14 , 161 ) use subject labs draw 21 day 2nd , 3rd 4th vaccine injection determine seroconversion . Subjects seroconvert TBEV offer booster dose vaccine 3 year date receipt third dose vaccine . Subjects seropositive entry study offer booster dose vaccine every 3 year Day 0 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All subject must meet follow criterion study entry : Be engage activity place potential risk occupational exposure TBEV viable form one participate intramural laboratory NIAID Be 18 year age old time first immunization . Comprehend study requirement . Provide write informed consent participate study . Be good health determine Investigator , base upon medical history target physical examination . Have stable health status determine Investigator . Have access consistent mean telephone contact , may either home workplace , land line mobile , NOT pay phone multipleuser device ( i.e. , common use phone serve multiple room apartment ) . Express availability require study period , ability attend schedule visit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The follow criterion check time study entry . If apply , subject include study : The subject must participate trial investigational drug vaccine 1 month prior first injection 21 day third injection . ( Given nature work study subject engage , exemption proscription may grant case case basis discussion Investigator IRB . ) The presence day immunization oral temperature &gt; 101.2 degree F acute symptom mild severity . Active systemic infectious process determine review system physical examination . The subject may enrol later date illness resolve . Known immune suppression , associate human immunodeficiency virus infection , condition , extent , opinion Investigator , subject likely poor response vaccine . This information obtain history . Serologic screen disease perform . Presence evidence substance abuse neurological psychiatric diagnosis , even clinically stable , deemed Investigator render potential subject unable/unlikely report promptly adverse reaction vaccine . Current diagnosis leukemia , Hodgkin disease , nonHodgkin lymphoma , cancer , autoimmune disease lupus , cause immunosuppression point , opinion Investigator , subject likely poor response vaccine . Currently receive systemic immunosuppressive chemotherapy immunotherapy ( include glucocorticoid ) result immune suppression point , opinion Investigator , subject likely poor response vaccine . Any neurological condition ( opinion Investigator ) integrity blood brain barrier may compromise . Licensed vaccine exclusionary give least 14 day immunization ( apply 3 schedule TBEV injection ) inactivate vaccine 30 day immunization live vaccine . This order avoid potential confusion adverse reaction . ( Given nature work study subject engage , exemption proscription may grant casebycase basis discussion Investigator IRB. ) . Previous anaphylactic reaction TBE vaccine . Known suspected anaphylactic reaction constituent FSME IMMUN , include formaldehyde , protamine sulfate , gentamicin neomycin , current egg allergy . Known pregnancy , anticipate become pregnant first 8 month study positive urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( beta hCG ) test result prior immunization . If subject become pregnant point time 1st injection , injection give pregnancy complete , longer nurse negative betahCG result . Lactating nursing . Women child bear potential ( define premenopausal undergone either hysterectomy tubal ligation ) lack history reliable contraceptive practice . Reliable contraceptive practice ( first 8 month study within 21 day prior 42 day booster immunization ) include : Consistent abstinence heterosexual activity Consistent use combine progestogen oral contraceptive Injectable progestogen Implants levonorgestrel Estrogen estrogen/progestogen vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patch Intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Successful vasectomy sole male partner , Double barrier method ( condom occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent ) A history prior infection TBEV previously receive TBE vaccine consider exclusionary criterion immunization protocol . However , subject antibody titer data include statistical analysis . Any condition , Investigator judgment , might result increase risk subject , would affect participation study . Additionally Investigator ability exclude subject reason he/she feel subject good candidate study able follow study procedure .</criteria>
