	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate ZADAXIN's® ( Thymalfasin ) Ability Enhance Immune Response H1N1sw Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence spread novel influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus great concern globally . Uremic patient especially vulnerable infection generally recommend vaccinate patient chronic renal insufficiency yearly influenza . In patient haemodialysis ( HD ) vaccination response consider suboptimal . Decreased antibody response T-cell dependent antigen may one factor account insufficient efficacy certain vaccination program ( eg , influenza ) . Diminished antibody response also report patient end-stage renal disease . The evidence impairment cell-mediated immunity hemodialysis patient attribute incompetence T-cell-mediated immune response . Since Zadaxin enhance T-cell-dependent specific antibody production , addition Zadaxin ( Thymosin alpha 1 ) vaccination program immunocompromised individual effective .</detailed_description>
