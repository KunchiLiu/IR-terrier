	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate safety tolerability SRT2104 ( 2.0 g administer daily 28 day ) examine effect SRT2104 ( 2.0 g administer daily 28 day ) reverse vasomotor fibrinolytic dysfunction type 2 diabetes mellitus patient otherwise healthy cigarette smoker feed state . This study investigate effect SRT2104 reduction platelet activation marker ( platelet-monocyte aggregate ) , evaluate effect SRT2104 platelet monocyte surface marker ( P-selectin , CD11b ) , inflammatory marker ( high sensitivity CRP , IL-6 , SAA , TNF-α sCD40L ) , marker oxidative stress ( urinary plasma F2-isoprostanes nitrotyrosine ) . Further goal study characterize pharmacokinetic profile SRT2104 single dose multiple administration type 2 diabetes mellitus patient otherwise healthy cigarette smoker feed state , explore effect SRT2104 potential biomarkers activity glucose control ( HbA1c , glycated albumin fructosamine ) and/or Sirt1 activation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Assess Safety Oral SRT2104 Its Effects Vascular Dysfunction Otherwise Healthy Cigarette Smokers Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover , safety , activity , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study 2.0 g SRT2104 administer orally daily 28 consecutive day two different population : type 2 diabetic ( T2D ) subject exist , stable , hypoglycemic regimen otherwise healthy cigarette smoker ( ≥ 10cigarettes/day least 1 year ) . Approximately 24 subject T2D 24 otherwise healthy cigarette smoker , age 18-60 year , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study ensure least 20 evaluable subject per population enrol . Subjects evenly stratify randomized receive SRT2104 2.0 g/day placebo daily 28 day . After 28 day , subject cross receive test article another 28 day dose , bring total dosing period 56 day . Subjects sign inform consent form screen visit ( occur within 21 day first dose test article ) , undergo screen assessment verify eligibility study . If eligible willing participate , subject return clinic Days -1 1 safety assessment , hematology biochemistry measurement , platelet monocyte aggregation ( PMA ) assessment , forearm venous occlusion plethysmography , pulse wave analysis ( PWA ) , pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) PK sample . The first dose test article occur Day 1 eligibility confirm . After 28 day dose period , subject return Day 28 Day 56 safety assessment , hematology biochemistry measurement , forearm plethysmography , PWA , PWV , PK sample . Subjects return clinic Days 2 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 safety assessment additional PK sampling . Subjects ask complete study drug diary daily basis compliance adverse event ( AE ) monitoring ( diabetic subject require monitor record fasting blood glucose diary also ) . An End Study visit occur 14 day follow final dose SRT2104 placebo Day 70 . A followup safety call make subject 30 day follow final dose SRT2104 placebo ( Day 86 ) .</detailed_description>
