	<brief_summary>Background : - Cannabis , also know marijuana , commonly abused drug . There approved medication treat cannabis addiction . The desire use cannabis often increase see others use see picture . Researchers interested determine part brain active look picture associate cannabis . - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) use magnetic pulse stimulate brain . These pulse change activity part brain . Researchers interested determine whether rTMS decrease activity part brain respond cannabis , thereby lessen craving cannabis . Objectives : - To determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation lower crave cannabis people use cannabis show image increase crave . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old physically healthy currently use cannabis ( least 3 time weekly past 2 year ) . Design : - The study involve eight visit 3 week , visit last 1 2 hour . - Participants initial assessment cannabis use provide blood urine sample begin study . - Participants three magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan . The first MRI scan look structure brain rest . During two scan , participant look image relate related cannabis use . - The rTMS session ( either actual TMS inactive [ sham ] TMS ) hold daily 5 consecutive day . During test visit , researcher ask question relate drug use craving , collect urine breath sample study . - Participants two follow-up visit , 1 week 2 week rTMS session , evaluate memory mood , one final MRI brain scan end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Cannabis Craving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) provide non-invasive mean alter brain neural activity . This pilot study test whether 5 day rTMS reduces cue-induced cannabis craving use cannabis user . Hypothesis : We predict active rTMS significantly low crave cannabis compare sham rTMS . Study population : Thirty healthy adult cannabis user ( least 2 year , currently average 3 time weekly ) major psychiatric disorder except nicotine dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) recruit community . Design : Following baseline phase evaluate subject characteristic , subject randomly assign receive 5 day active sham rTMS . rTMS 1 Hz strength 120 % motor threshold applied dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) use figure 8 coil , begin 1 second presentation cannabis-associated visual cue last 30 second . Brain site localization use computerize navigation system base structural MRI scan obtain first session . Each rTMS session ( last around 31 minute ) consist 54 trial ( cue presentation ) : 36 cannabis-associated cue 9 non-drug-associated positive neutral cue . No rTMS administer non-cannabis-associated cue . Subjects return follow-up assessment one two week final rTMS session . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure cannabis crave assessed Marijuana Craving Questionnaire visual analog scale every rTMS session one- two-week follow-up . Secondary outcome measure self-reported cannabis use urine drug test rTMS session follow-up visit , change regional brain response cannabis-associated visual cue assess fMRI do 5 rTMS session . Benefits : The future benefit society may development good method treatment cannabis addiction . Risks : The primary risk rTMS transient headache , scalp discomfort , decrease spatial recognition memory , hear loss ( minimize wear ear plug ) . Seizures rare rTMS administer within accept safety guideline individual increase risk seizure exclude . The risk induce manic episode minimize exclude individual history non-drug-induced mania/hypomania .</detailed_description>
