	<detailed_description>Elective liver resection perform primarily treatment benign malignant liver tumors1 . In addition , increase use living donor liver transplantation supplement inadequate pool cadaveric organ available , liver resection perform also live liver donors2 . Postoperative complication common follow liver resection . Occurrence complication increase ICU hospital stay , resource utilization . The serious postoperative complication liver resection post-resectional liver failure ( PLF ) 3 . Risk factor development PLF preexisting liver disease , especially cirrhosis , excessive blood loss liver resection , liver ischemia reperfusion injury4-5 . Several strategy develop combat excessive intra-operative blood loss include : lowering central venous pressure6 , hypoventilation7 , hepatic inflow occlusion use atraumatic clamp8 ( Pringle 's maneuver ) 9 ; While inflow occlusion important step , hepatic ischemia reperfusion important sequel inflow occlusion . Therefore , intervention decrease hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury liver potential improve outcome follow liver resection . A strategy directly modulate hepatic response ischemia ischemic preconditioning ( IPC ) . Classically , IPC induce expose organ brief period ischemia reperfusion expose organ prolong ischemic insult . In patient undergo liver resection , IPC decrease postoperative aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) levels15 . IPC also associate decreased histological evidence apoptosis well immunohistochemical evidence increase protective gene expression16 liver . The primary disadvantage IPC direct stress target organ well mechanical trauma major vasculature . More recently , find inhale volatile anesthetic Desflurane , Sevoflurane Isoflurane induce similar precondition effects19 without cause significant direct organ damage . While several animal study exist , demonstrate hepatoprotective effect volatile anesthetic liver23 , limited clinical data examine effect human . One recent small clinical study , examine precondition effect volatile anesthetic patient undergo liver surgery , show anesthetic pre conditioning ( APC ) use Sevoflurane significantly decrease several measure liver dysfunction postoperatively24 . However , Sevoflurane partially metabolize liver may increase plasma fluoride concentration . Also , may react CO2 absorbent produce Compound-A , turn link nephrotoxicity . On hand , isoflurane , another inhalational anesthetic agent commonly use liver surgery also show precondition effect experimental animal , carry potential side effect sevoflurane . Therefore , primary objective study examine efficacy isoflurane induce clinically effective preconditioning patient undergo elective hepatic surgery . Study Design : In prospective study , patient undergo elective liver resection inflow occlusion ( Pringle maneuver ) UH , Newark randomize ( 1:1 ) either standard anesthetic management Propofol ( No APC group ) anesthetic precondition 2 minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) isoflurane ( APC group ) . Because preexist liver disease , especially cirrhosis , important determinant post operative outcome , balance randomization subject regard important variable randomization stratify without preexist liver disease . The primary endpoint occurrence postoperative complication grade IIIb great ( Clavien 's classification ) . The secondary endpoint peak postoperative aspartate alanine aminotransferase ( AST ALT ) total bilirubin ( T Bili ) , length ICU hospital stay , decrease liver lipid peroxidation apoptosis</detailed_description>
