	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety , local tolerability pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb body , distribute within body remove body time ) single intramuscular injection ( inject directly muscle ) 300 mg ( Panel 1 ) 600 mg ( Panel 2 ) new long acting form TMC278 . In Panel 3 , safety , local tolerability pharmacokinetics study three successive intramuscular injection ( single injection Day1 , single injection Day15 single injection Day43 ) select dose TMC278 LA formulation . The dose Panel 3 determine base safety , local tolerability pharmacokinetic result obtain Panel 1 2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC278-TiDP15-C158 - A Study Examine Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Single Dose Three Successive Doses Intramuscularly ( IM ) Injected Long Acting Formulation TMC278</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study evaluate safety , local tolerability pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb body , distribute within body remove body time ) newly select long act ( LA ) formulation TMC278 . This study enroll 20 healthy volunteer . The first part study ( Panel 1 + 2 ) open-label study ( physician volunteer know identity drug inject ) determine safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics single IM injection TMC278 LA . In first Panel , 300 mg TMC278 LA inject . After 3 day , safety tolerability issue occur , 600 mg dose TMC278 LA inject volunteer Panel 2 . The second part study double blind , placebo-controlled ( neither physician volunteer know inject TMC278 LA placebo ) . Volunteers third Panel receive 3 dos ( one dose Day 1 , Day 15 Day 43 ) LA formulation TMC278 use Panel 1 2 . The Panel 3 dose select base safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic result obtain Panel 1 2 , evaluate dedicate Data Safety Review Committee . The dose three consecutive injection . In Panels , injection give muscle buttock ( alternate left right buttock Panel 3 ) . Throughout study , injection site monitor closely sign pain , pain touch , itching , bruise , redness color , induration , swell inflammation medical staff participate volunteer . Every Injection Site Reaction ( ISR ) occur documented adverse event . Additional safety assessment include monitor laboratory work include urine sample , vital sign ECG . Volunteers Panel 1 2 remain follow-up minimally 12 week injection . They allow leave study condition TMC278 plasma concentration 20 ng/mL previously emerge adverse event resolve stabilize ( i.e . accord investigator sponsor , AE require medical follow-up ) . The condition apply volunteer Panel 3 . In Panel 1 2 , volunteer receive one single IM dose 300 mg 600 mg TMC278 LA . In Panel 3 , volunteer receive three IM dose consecutively ( Day 1 , Day 15 Day 43 ) TMC278 LA . The dose 3 injection Panel 3 determine , base safety , local tolerability pharmacokinetic data Panel 1 2 . Six volunteer receive TMC278 LA , 2 receive placebo .</detailed_description>
