	<brief_summary>Background : - The prevalence cigarette smoking among individual schizophrenia noticeably higher general population , smoke cessation attempt frequently unsuccessful population . Little known effect cigarette/nicotine crave individual schizophrenia . Researchers interested learn crave affect people schizophrenia develop new way treat craving improve effectiveness smoke cessation therapy treatment . - In recent year , virtual reality ( VR ) study determine whether use induce crave use life-like cue setting . VR cue involve cigarette use , include image cigarette scent cue tobacco smoke , may use elicit crave smoker . Researchers interested learning individual schizophrenia respond specific VR cue setting . Objectives : - To determine feasibility use contextual real-world paradigm use virtual reality involve cigarette smoking people schizophrenia . - To examine virtual reality cue elicit crave smoker schizophrenia . Eligibility : - Current smoker ( five cigarette per day least 1 year ) 18 45 year age diagnose schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder . Design : - The study involve three session , initial screen visit , test session , follow-up session . - Screening visit : Participants screen medical psychiatric history , answer question smoke history , current smoking habit crave pattern , general anxiety level . This session also introduce participant operation use VR equipment . Participants comfortable use VR system return within 2 day test session . - Test session : Participants use VR equipment view neutral scene scene design elicit craving cigarette . After view scene , participant answer question overall mood , anxiety level , cigarette craving may . - Follow-up session : Participants return 1 week VR session answer question mood , anxiety level , current smoking habit crave pattern .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Craving Nicotine-Dependent Patients With Schizophrenia Using Virtual Reality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Nicotine use high people schizophrenia ; however , intervention aid smoke cessation overwhelmingly successful . Craving , particularly situational craving , one reason people relapse . Craving paradigms people schizophrenia need optimize order test new treatment crave measure population . Thus , purpose study determine feasibility effect virtual reality cue crave intensity smoking patient schizophrenia Study population : We enroll 25 smoker DSM IV diagnosis schizophrenia goal obtain total 16 completers . Design : This study use comparison-controlled , within-subject design . All subject undergo baseline assessment acclimation period participate experimental condition four cue present separate room VR program . These include two smoke cue two neutral cue four different room . A follow session crave symptom assessment occur one week experimental session . Outcome Measures : During Cue trial Cigarette Craving Visual Analogue Scale ( CCVAS ) , four-item scale , Tobacco Craving Questionnaire-Short Form ( TCQ-SF ) administer measure cigarette crave virtual reality session . At end 4 cue ( neutral , smoke cue interaction , smoke cue interaction , neutral ) participant ask crave . The CCVAS project VR environment participant respond via hand controller . To assess mood status , Mood form also administer baseline well end 4 cue . Before experimental session participant also rat Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , Schedule Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) , side effect , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) . The Immersion Questionnaire Imagery Realism Presence Questionnaire ( PQ ) give conclusion experimental session . During experiment participant monitor physiological reactivity ( heart rate , blood pressure , skin conductance response ) cue smoke well neutral cue measure . Additionally , subject assess experimental session</detailed_description>
