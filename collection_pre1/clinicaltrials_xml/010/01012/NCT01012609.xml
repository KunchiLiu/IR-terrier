	<brief_summary>Standard treatment patient diffuse pontine tumor radiation therapy , le 10 % patient cure . Adding standard chemotherapy improved cure rate . Standard treatment high-grade astrocytomas surgery radiation . The surgeon remove much tumor . Radiation try kill cancer cell leave . Some patient also get chemotherapy . These anti-cancer drug . They give radiation . Current standard treatment cure many patient . In study doctor add new medication call cetuximab treatment also use chemotherapy medication ( irinotecan ) promise patient treat recurrent disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must either ( 1 ) histologic proof highgrade astrocytoma review POETIC institutional pathologist ( 2 ) radiological diagnosis via MRI scan typical diffuse pontine tumor make POETIC institutional neuroradiologist . Patients radiological diagnosis via MRI scan typical diffuse pontine tumor enrol diffuse pontine tumor arm study regardless histology case biopsied . Note : For collaborate nonPOETIC institution , review may do institutional pathologist/neuroradiologist . Patients must begin study prescribe therapy within 42 day neurosurgical resection biopsy tumor ( highgrade astrocytoma patient ) radiological diagnosis ( diffuse pontine tumor patient ) . Age ≥ 3years &lt; 22yearsold . Brain MRI ( study do accord clinical indication ) must show definitive evidence leptomeningeal extraneural metastasis . ANC ≥ 1000/μL platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL Patients must adequate organ function define : Hepatic : total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl , AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal . Renal : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal age , calculate creatinine clearance nuclear GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73 m2 . The patient , minor , parent legal guardian , must give informed write consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Evidence leptomeningeal extraneural metastatic disease . Prior radiation therapy chemotherapy Pregnancy , mother unwilling refrain breastfeeding , sexually mature patient unwilling practice effective form birth control . Other significant concomitant medical illness would compromise patient 's ability receive prescribe study therapy . Prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway . Prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody . Significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction .
