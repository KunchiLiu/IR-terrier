	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . Study pharmacokinetics safety daptomycin child hemodialysis ( HD ) peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) . 2 . Determine urine , HD PD clearance daptomycin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Pharmacokinetics Daptomycin Children With Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infectious sepsis event one common complication child chronic kidney disease . The incidence high child access dialysis , especially catheter . Staphylococcal specie account 50 % access infection ( range 58-77 % ) . Failure clear infection result loss dialysis access . Daptomycin new antibiotic provide coverage gram positive bacteria include methicillin-resistant staphylococci , vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant enterococci . The pharmacokinetics daptomycin child dialysis , group patient may need medication , remain unknown . Children HD PD suspect confirmed infection due gram-positive bacteria concurrently treat standard care antibiotic consider study . Each patient give onetime dose Cubicin ( daptomycin ) . After receive daptomycin , serial blood sample along dialysis effluent urine ( obtain non-anuric patient ) collect evaluate pharmacokinetic profile drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children 1217 year age either HD PD Pediatric Nephrology Section OU Children 's Physicians Clinics provide care . In addition child chronic HD PD therapy , patient newly initiate HD PD also recruit study . Patients suspect confirmed case dialysis relate infection grampositive bacteria receive standard care antibiotic . Patients eligible enrollment admit inpatient Children 's hospital outpatient dialysis clinic Patients &gt; 17 year age Patients &lt; 12 year age Total amount blood draw part standard care pharmacokinetic analysis exceed 3 ml/kg 8 week period Taking HMG CoA reductase inhibitor within 7 day daptomycin administration Having use daptomycin 30 day precede study entry Participating experimental procedure 30 day precede study A history muscular disease neurological disease Baseline creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) value equal great 1.5 time upper limit normal ( normal range 65370 IU/L ) Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dl Hemodynamic instability within 72 hour study enrollment Female subject positive pregnancy test failure take pregnancy test</criteria>
