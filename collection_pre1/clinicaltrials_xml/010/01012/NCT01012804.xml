	<brief_title>Study Biomarkers Tissue Samples From Patients With Metastatic Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine effect surgical resection , term physiological stress , level tumor marker protein kinase A ( PKA ) expression patient metastatic colon cancer . - Estimate variation among patient baseline tumor marker tumor tissue serum . - Correlate marker tumor tissue serum patient . - Establish tissue bank specimens future study . OUTLINE : Biopsy surgical specimen obtain standard surgery ( patient may tumor tissue obtain study entry store ) . Serum sample tumor tissue analyze immunohistochemistry western blot . Tumor marker ( PKA expression ) determine marker level measure serum sample tissue . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
