	<brief_summary>This 12-week , open-label , pilot trial evaluate efficacy safety combination Clobex® spray excimer laser therapy initial treatment generalize plaque psoriasis , follow maintenance therapy topical Vectical . The study conduct three distinct period , namely Period A , Period B , Period C , 4 week duration . During Period A ( week 1 4 ) , patient use Clobex® spray twice daily along excimer laser treatment twice weekly Photomedex XTRAC® Velocity machine . The goal Period A achieve Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) 75 100 % patient within four week . During Period B ( week 5 8 ) , patient would treat topical Vectical® twice daily . Thus , steroid-free interval patient use Clobex® spray . The goal Period B maintain patient 's response use non-steroid option . During Period C study , patient use Clobex® spray BID Vectical® BID . Period C ( week 9 12 ) `` booster '' period goal see 100 % patient achieve Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) 90-100 . Regarding excimer laser therapy : patient receive excimer laser therapy twice weekly first 6 week study ( halfway point ) 12 excimer laser treatment . At point , patient achieve &lt; Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) 75 response continue receive twice weekly excimer laser treatment remain 6 week study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Combination Treatment With Excimer Laser , Clobex Spray , Vectical Ointment Treatment Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis inflammatory skin disease affect approximately 2 % population , approximately one-third patient experience generalize psoriasis ( ) . Current treatment option include topical medication , ultraviolet B oral psoralen ultraviolet A phototherapy , biologic agent , non-biologic systemic medication , combination aforementioned . Phototherapy treatment , although effective many patient , often inconvenient , require three treatment weekly 2-3 month order achieve significant improvement patient 's psoriasis . The new biologic medication , effective many patient , work systemic immunosuppression increase risk malignancy , infection include tuberculosis histoplasmosis , congestive heart failure , lupus-like syndrome , demyelinate disease , etc . In addition side effect systemic immunosuppression , non-biologic systemic agent major organ toxicity potential side effect include bone marrow suppression , liver toxicity , kidney toxicity , etc . Currently , threshold new era , possibility exists treat generalized psoriasis absolute systemic safety well efficacy systemic biologic agent . This possibility become reality `` perfect storm , '' three storm collide . This `` perfect storm '' may achieve result therapy yet achieve : Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) 75 response 100 % patient 4 week therapy . The three `` storm '' include Clobex® spray , Vectical® ointment , excimer laser machine XTRAC® Velocity . Laser therapy ( fiberoptically-directed monochromatic UVB light ) target psoriatic plaque . This allow much aggressive phototherapy compare traditional ultraviolet B oral psoralen ultraviolet A , expose non-involved skin well psoriatic skin UV light . With aggressive excimer laser therapy , well know psoriasis improve significantly clear approximately ten session instead 30 40 session need regular full-body phototherapy achieve clearance skin . This dramatic difference attribute fact psoriatic lesion able withstand much high dose light non-involved skin . Excimer laser therapy dose determine maximum tolerance psoriatic skin whereas full body UV therapy dosing determine MED ( minimal erythema dose ) non-involved skin . Delivery high dos subsequently result faster clinical response much great clinical efficacy . Hence , new supra-erythemogenic phototherapy strategy result few number session need clearance ( ) . The supra-erythemogenic phototherapy strategy involve deliver UVB dose much great minimal erythema dose ( MED ) ( 2 ) . MED traditional limit aggressively non-laser phototherapy conduct ( UVB dose beyond MED burn patient ) . In addition , excimer laser therapy result photo-damage non-involved skin , give targeted application . The Photomedex XTRAC® Velocity late version excimer laser , 300-400 % powerful predecessor , XTRAC® Ultra machine . This increased power make treatment generalize , moderate severe psoriasis feasible attractive . Time required treatment decrease one-third , compare XTRAC® Ultra previously powerful excimer laser machine . XTRAC® Velocity yet available : schedule introduced month . With XTRAC® Velocity , expect generalized psoriasis patient 10-30 % total body surface involvement treat 10-15 minute great improvement achieve approximately ten laser treatment session . Using XTRAC® Ultra machine , pilot study 9 patient receive excimer laser therapy twice weekly 12 week , 77 % patient achieve Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) 75 response ( ) . In another study 124 patient stable plaque psoriasis ( n = 124 ) cover less 10 % body surface area ( BSA ) enrol 80 complete study ( ) . Seventy-two percent patient achieve least 75 % clearing average 6.2 treatment . Thirty-five percent achieve 90 % clearing average 7.5 treatment . In another study 40 patient treated excimer laser protocol determine MED involved skin , patient clear approximately half number treatment compare patient treat protocol dosage determine MED non-involved skin ( ) . However , aggressive laser therapy also irritate skin , Clobex® spray ideal partner enhance efficacy prevent irritation skin aggressive , supra-erythemogenic UVB irradiation . Moreover , beyond prevention skin irritation , additional merit combine Clobex® spray excimer laser . These follow : - The real possibility synergistic efficacy two effective , external therapeutic modality combine possibly result 100 % patient achieve Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) 75 week 12 , week 4 therapy . If type efficacy demonstrate , would wipe competition term therapeutic efficacy . - It tedious treat multiple small plaque excimer laser therapy alone . The use Clobex® ® spray help eliminate small psoriatic plaque en masse . - Laser therapy help eliminate stubborn plaque still resistant Clobex® ® spray use BID one month . In study 1254 subject treat clobetasol propionate spray 0.05 % monotherapy twice daily four week , 35.7 % patient achieve clearance 37.3 % patient almost clear use 6-point target plaque severity scale . Additionally , week 4 , 80 % subject achieve target plaque severity ( TPS ) success , p &lt; 0.001 . This specifically define score clear , almost clear use TPS scale improvement severity 2 grade . Topical steroid potential adrenal suppression . However , topical steroid use one month less time , transient adrenal suppression may result clinical problem.Furthermore , use Clobex® spray , patient require steroid-free interval 4 week therapy . The effect Clobex® spray maintain safe , non-steroidal topical medication , Vectical . This new Vitamin D topical agent use 210 g weekly , compare topical calcipotriol ( Dovonex® ) limit 100 g weekly , due good safety profile Vectical . Thus , Vectical use patient generalized plaque psoriasis cover 35 % body surface area . In addition , comparative study 250 patient demonstrated Vectical cause significantly less skin irritation compare calcipotriol ( ) . Thus , imminent approval Vectical , enter new era Vitamin D analogue use treat patient generalized psoriasis . With three `` storm '' gather force , propose follow study .</detailed_description>
