	<brief_title>Video-guided Percutaneous Tracheostomy ( PCT ) Versus Conventional PCT : Comparing Safety Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Percutaneous tracheostomy ( PCT ) commonly use critically-ill patient require long-term mechanical ventilation intensive care unit ( ICU ) . While effective safe , technique complication . These include paratracheal insertion tracheostomy tube , tracheal injury ; puncture cuff transfix endotracheal tube ( ETT ) transtracheal needle insertion ; insert guide wire Murphy 's eye ; accidental extubation withdraw endotracheal tube procedure leading loss airway [ 1-6 ] . Although use fingertip palpate trachea endotracheal tube useful technique locate tip endotracheal tube procedure , unreliable , particularly patient short thick neck . There report low rate acute complication endoscopic ( bronchoscopic ) guidance [ 7-11 ] . However , adequate control study show endoscopic-guided tracheostomy superior 'blind ' one . Moreover , expensive tool readily available center . Video guidance provide cost-effective alternative bronchoscope , may also reduce risk procedure-related complication paratracheal insertion tracheostomy tube , tracheal injury cuff puncture [ 12 ] . The goal study evaluate safety , efficacy operability video-guided PCT compare standard PCT . Video-guided PCT , bedside safe simple technique perform ICU without assistance pulmonologist , may overcome limitation standard percutaneous tracheostomy . The technique base ETView TVTTM , commercially available ETT , embed mini video-camera tip tube . It provide direct endoscopic visualization larynx tracheal mucosa , thereafter allow determination tip transtracheal needle percutaneous puncture trachea , hence may reduce likelihood paratracheal insertion , tracheal injury , technical complication . The ETView TVTTM device compatible medical grade NTSC video monitor , thereby provide monitoring airway intubation PCT procedure , well continuous view airway long mechanical ventilation require . Study Objectives To compare video-guided PCT standard technique term success rate , efficacy , safety , outcomes.. Study design The study conduct comparative , semi-blinded , match one ( accord sex , age difficult airway - assess accord neck diameter anatomical parameter ) . The set ICU Sourasky medical center . 60 consecutive adult critically ill patient require elective tracheostomy recruit study . Informed consent obtain family next kin study patient . In absence relative , consent give anesthesiologist/intensivist related study . Both procedure perform team intensivists upon study patient . During follow procedure assess parameter mention . Methods The procedure The procedure perform ICU team include : anesthesiologist/intensivist execute procedure , another anesthesiologist apply anesthetic &amp; analgesia , nurse , forth person take time . During procedure ( either standard PCT video-guided PCT ) oxygen saturation , end tidal carbon dioxide ( ETCO2 ) , ECG , blood pressure , arterial blood gas monitor continuously . The video-guided PCT procedure require extubation re-intubation TVTTM tube . Re-intubation TVTTM tube perform commonly practice intubation . The ETView Tracheoscopic system ( TVTTM ) consist ETT , embed video image device light source tip integrate cable connector , may wire video monitor . The imaging system use monitor airways intubating , beyond vocal cord , locate transtracheal insertion site needle . In addition , light source serve transillumination neck soft tissue , order delineate tracheal curvature identify anatomical deviation . Anesthesia analgesia routinely perform , standardize study patient . Low dos opiate fentanyl ( 2-3 μg/kg ) short-acting sedative propofol ( 20 mg bolus , 3-6mg/kg/h drip ) administer begin procedure . Rocuronium bromide , brief acting muscle paralyzer , 0.6mg/kg , also use patient . Patient follow-up The execute physician answer questionnaire evaluate intraprocedural difficulty , complication , feasibility , confidence , operability . A second physician , blind procedure perform , monitor study patient first 6h procedure , discharge . Follow-up include documentation procedure-related complication , monitor respiratory/ventilatory parameter length stay ( LOS ) ICU beyond 6h ( due medical circumstance related procedure ) . All study patient place arterial line withdraw blood procedure , indicated deterioration respiratory parameter - blood gas analysis ( PaO2/FiO2 , PaCO2 , pH BE ) . In addition , saturation document hourly , patient chest x-ray perform immediately follow tracheostomy . Safety assess frequency procedure-related complication . These include : A . Technical complication : False route/paratracheal insertion , injury thoracic vessel , tracheal/laryngeal/esophageal injury , accidental decannulation , puncture cuff , insert guide wire Murphy 's eye , malpositioning kink tracheal cannula , fail tracheostomy , multiple puncture ( ≥3 ) . B . Clinical complication potentially related procedure : B.1 . Intraprocedural : endotracheal bleeding ( &gt; 100cc ) transfusion requirement ( RBC , FFP platelet ) , transient hypoxia/hypoxemia , hemodynamic change ( e.g. , transient hypotension relate anesthetic ) . B.2 . Postprocedure : alteration respiratory function ( define &gt; 15 % reduction saturation PaO2/FiO2 , compare baseline ; Increased PaCO2 without change saturation ; need change ventilatory setting and/or add PEEP within first 24 hr ) , atelectasis , pneumothorax , pneumomediastinum , aspiration , early unexplained mortality ( within first 24 hr ) . Operability evaluate via questionnaire answer execute intensivist ( enclose within proposal document ) . The main parameter ask evaluate : whether transtracheal needle recognize via TVTTM ( yes/no ) ; intraoperative difficulty ; number technical complication ; level confidence ; ease performance ( `` best practice '' ) ; need convert surgical tracheostomy procedure . In addition , another member team measure operative time , include total duration procedure ; time take recognize tracheal insertion site needle ; time perform PCT , define time since ETT placement successful tracheal placement confirm via air bubble ETCO2 . Study size A power analysis time perform PCT primary endpoint , 80 % power detect 5 minute reduction outcome significance 0.05 great , indicate least 17 patient would require group . We wish enroll 30 patient group .</detailed_description>
