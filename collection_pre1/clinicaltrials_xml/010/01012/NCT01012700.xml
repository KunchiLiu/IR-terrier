	<brief_summary>Vaccines induce protective immunity numerous infectious disease . However , current vaccine limit efficacy challenge infection like tuberculosis , malaria HIV . Protein vaccines safe , typically , induce weak T cell immunity administer alone . Therefore , special attention give adjuvant , enhancer immunity , mature antigen present immunostimulatory dendritic cell ( DCs ) . Our goal study human mechanism whereby synthetic adjuvant , act define pattern recognition receptor ( PRR ) , enhance T B cell immunity . In preclinical study , investigator ' laboratory find mice poly IC analog poly ICLC superior adjuvant T cell mediate immunity relative agonist PRR . In study investigator propose study safety innate immune response poly ICLC multiple blood cell type , include three different subset DCs administer subcutaneously intranasally healthy volunteer . Poly ICLC stabilize double strand RNA extensively study human favorable safety profile .</brief_summary>
