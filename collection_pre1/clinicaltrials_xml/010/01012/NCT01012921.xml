	<brief_summary>The aim study test randomize comparative study performance Straumann® MembraGel ( PEG Membrane ) act barrier guide bone regeneration compare standard collagen membrane ( BioGide® ) bone regeneration around Straumann® SLActive bone level titanium implant . Furthermore clinical evaluation comparison complementary parameter describe bony soft tissue environment surgical site study period evaluate effectiveness performance membrane .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At primary endpoint study - 6 month post-operative - vertical bone gain measure change . The change evaluate measure distance implant shoulder first visible bone contact implant . The measurement take medial distal aspect implant site interest . Measurements take account distortion base change radiograph true dimension implant . Intra-oral photograph take study visit document initial appearance soft tissue subsequent healing soft tissue post-implant placement . The photograph take buccal occlusial study site interest . The physical appearance soft tissue ( form , colour , tissue biotype , surface aspect ) clinically assess visual inspection . In addition change high keratinize gingiva assess mm . This measure mid-crestal buccal direction mucogingival border periodontal probe . Changes gingival recession measure implant lead visit yearly follow-up visit 18 , 30 42 month post surgery . The distance margin gingiva edge crown assess accessible buccal , palatal , distal medial site . A measurement vertical defect height perform evaluate distance implant shoulder first bone implant contact surgery visit 6-month later .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must voluntarily sign informed consent form study relate action Males females must least 18 year age 80 year old . Have least one miss tooth posterior mandible maxilla quadrant 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( FDI position 47 ) , require one dental implant . Partially edentulous patient patient need fix dental prosthesis The tooth implant site ( ) must extract lose least 6 week date implantation . Bone defect ( ) must present vertical dimension great equal 3 mm foreseen GBR site measure dental implant placement . Full mouth bleed Probing ( FMBoP ) full mouth plaque score ( FMPI ) low equal 25 % Patients must commit study . Presence condition require chronic routine prophylactic use antibiotic ( e.g. , history rheumatic heart disease , bacterial endocarditis , cardiac valvular anomaly , prosthetic joint replacement ) Major systemic disease Medical condition require prolong use steroid Use Bisphosphonate intravenously Current pregnancy breastfeed woman Physical mental handicap would interfere ability perform adequate oral hygiene Alcoholism chronically drug abuse Immunocompromised patient Patients smoke 10 cigarette per day cigar equivalent , chew tobacco Conditions circumstance , opinion investigator , would prevent completion study participation interfere analysis study result , history noncompliance , unreliability . Local exclusion criterion Local inflammation , include untreated periodontitis Regenerative treatment necessary adjacent plan study site interest Mucosal diseases oral lesion History local irradiation therapy Severe bruxing clench habit Persistent intraoral infection Patients inadequate oral hygiene unmotivated adequate home care Previous GBR GTR treatment implant site Lack primary stability dental implant site interest . In instance patient must withdraw patient treat accordingly ( exclusion criterion surgery )</criteria>
