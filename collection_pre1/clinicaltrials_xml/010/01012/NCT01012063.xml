	<brief_title>Perioperative Iron With Erythropoietin Bilateral Total Knee Replacement Arthroplasty ( TKRA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee replacement arthroplasty ( TKRA ) severe osteoarthritis usually require extensive soft tissue bone dissection associate substantial bleeding . Because TKRA perform pneumatic tourniquet , intraoperative bleeding substantial , however , 80 % total blood loss occur within first 24 hour operation hide blood loss 50 % total loss , make true blood loss twice . Consequently , many patient become anemic early postoperative period anemic condition may lead overall physical deterioration include fatigue , dizziness , reduce exercise tolerance delay recovery . Therefore , many patient frequently receive autologous allogenic blood transfusion . In order reduce allogenic blood transfusion ( ABT ) , various method use , preoperative autologous blood donation ( PABD ) , use pharmacologic agent , iron erythropoietin ( Epo ) postoperative blood salvage . All method prove reduce ABT effectively6 , without increase cost . Iron Epo use widely variety clinical situation instead allogenic RBC transfusion . They also use augment PABD improve preoperative hemoglobin ( Hb ) level . However , still remain controversy efficacy method postoperative anemia . We think various result may relate individual iron state patient dose drug time drug application . In trial , iron Epo plan administer iron deficient non anemic patient operation surgery .</detailed_description>
