	<brief_title>A Study NewGam , Human Immunoglobulin 10 % , Patients With Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NewGam new 10 % human normal immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) solution develop Octapharma intravenous administration . It supply liquid formulation ready use . The primary therapeutic use immunoglobulin provide antibody prevent viral bacterial disease ( replacement therapy ) . IVIG prove useful variety clinical condition replacement immunoglobulin ; IVIG exhibit immunomodulatory effect . Children adult Primary Immunodeficiency Disease ( PID ) increase risk recurrent bacterial viral infection typically attack respiratory tract ( sinusitis , bronchitis , pneumonia ) also affect gastrointestinal tract ( gastroenteritis ) . Theses disease severe lead substantial morbidity . Responses antibacterial therapy often poor . At present , primary immune deficiency curable , IVIGs show decrease total number severe infection duration hospitalization .</detailed_description>
