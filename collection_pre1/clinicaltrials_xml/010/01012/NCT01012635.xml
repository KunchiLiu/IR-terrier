	<brief_title>Chronic Pain Brain Activity Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During first study visit , subject receive physical exam electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , measure brain activity . Research staff put cap head sensor measure brain activity . There risk electrical shock . In addition sensor cap , two clip put ear . EEG activity collect 20 minute : eye open ten minute , eye close ten minute . Additional study visit follow perform five different procedure ( neurofeedback , self-hypnosis , two level transcranial direct current stimulation , meditation ) . All subject receive five procedure procedure conduct 20 minute . Self-Hypnosis Training : You give verbal suggestion audio recording ( via headphone ) relaxation change way think pain . Meditation : You ask focus single word ( `` one '' ) entire session . Neurofeedback Training : During procedure , three sensor place scalp , one earlobe . A small amount electrode paste use place sensor scalp . There risk electrical shock . You able see image computer screen correspond brain wave . You learn change brainwave change image computer . Electric Stimulation ( two different level ) : This procedure consist direct stimulation brain weak electrical current . The two procedure session differ characteristic stimulation . Two electrode place scalp secure rubber strap . The tDCS procedure consider experimental currently approve FDA study previously , level current , spinal cord injury . Before procedure complete 10 minute EEG assessment similar described . The final procedure session end 20 minute assessment determine responsive hypnosis . Each procedure visit may last three hour . There total 6 study visit approximately 2 month .</detailed_description>
