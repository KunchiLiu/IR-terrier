As project focus patient outcome , follow-up well-formulated study design power address specific hypotheses nature effect critical . The propose study specifically test QOL survival effect CHESS lung cancer patient . Using site Wisconsin , Connecticut , Houston , Chicago , randomly assign 376 advanced lung cancer patient two study arm : patient control group receive Usual Care ( include access computer Internet ) group give access CHESS website . Patients may invite caregiver participate . Patients follow 18 month patient death .</detailed_description>
