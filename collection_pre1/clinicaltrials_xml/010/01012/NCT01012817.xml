	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose veliparib topotecan hydrochloride see well work treat patient solid tumor , ovarian cancer come back respond treatment , primary peritoneal cancer . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving veliparib chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose combination ABT-888 ( veliparib ) weekly topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) adult patient advance solid tumor . ( Phase I ) II . To identify anti-tumor activity treatment combination , assess objective response patient advance solid tumor . ( Phase I ) III . To assess confirm response rate patient epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal carcinoma treat combination ABT-888 weekly topotecan . IV . To assess progression free response ( PFS ) patient epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal carcinoma treat combination ABT-888 weekly topotecan . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify pharmacokinetic interaction ABT-888 topotecan . ( Phase I ) II . To determine whether topotecan stimulates adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -ribose polymer formation circulate peripheral blood mononuclear cell . ( Phase I ) III . To determine whether ABT-888 inhibits basal topotecan-stimulated ADP-ribose polymer formation . ( Phase I ) IV . To assess difference toxicity and/or efficacy regimen base BRCA 1/2 mutational status . ( Phase II ) V. To determine whether pretreatment tumor cell level topoisomerase I , poly ADP-ribose polymerase ( PARP ) , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , XRCC1 , tyrosyl-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) phosphodiesterase 1 ( TDP1 ) , P-glycoprotein breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) predict response regimen . ( Phase II ) VI . To identify , exploratory manner , transcriptional profile may predict response regimen . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study veliparib topotecan hydrochloride follow phase II study . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 ( veliparib omit day 1-3 course 2 ) topotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 2 , 9 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month ( Phase I ) every 3 6 month 5 year ( Phase II ) .</detailed_description>
