	<brief_title>Clinical Study Efficiency Three Different Attachment Systems Implant-supported Mandibular Overdenture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide two part - first part study 46 fully mandibular edentulous patient enrol . The patient recruit University Hospital Dentistry 9 private practice Bucharest surround area . Selected patient informed two different treatment option , benefit treatment overdenture retain two endosseous implant write informed consent obtain participant . Initial examination At begin treatment patient record : - The medical status . - The dental history , oral radiographic examination . - The hygiene status . - An evaluation exist denture . - The estimation dysfunctional problem . Treatment procedure Each patient receive 2 screw-type Straumann ( Institut Straumann AG , Basel , Switzerland ) standard implant Ø4.1 mm , SLA surface canine region mandible interconnect line approach parallelism terminal mandibular hinge axis . The implant length 10mm 12mm . The choice implant length dictate preoperative radiographic assessment bone height canine region drill distance principal concern achieve primary stability . The implant insert local anaesthesia use surgical template derive tooth wax-up . The implant place 1-stage non-submerged procedure accord strict protocol ( Weingart D ten Bruggenkate 2000 ) . Postoperatively , antibiotic 5 day treatment ( Amoxicillin Clavulanate Potassium Erytromycin - patient alergic Penicillin ) , analgesic Clorhexidine 0,12 % mouth rinse prescribe 14 day . Patients allow wear mandibular denture first two week post-operatively . One , two four week surgical procedure , patient recall follow-up visit . At first recall visit , suture remove . At second visit lower denture adjust selective grinding implant location , Protefix® ( Queisser Pharma Germany ) Adhesive Cushions provide patient . At recall visit , patient receive oral hygiene instruction . At third follow-up visit manufacture new maxillary denture ( full maxillary edentulous patient ) mandibular over-denture initiate . After 6 week heal period implant load patient randomly assigne one two main group : - Group B 23 patient receive retentive anchor ( Institut Straumann AG , Basel , Switzerland ) . - Group M 23 patient receive magnet ( Titanmagnetics® Institut Straumann AG , Basel , Switzerland ) . Group B randomly divide two subgroup : full low denture two gold matrix variable retention ( four lamella function like spring - 12 patient full low denture two titanium matrix define retention ( spring define extraction force 700-1100g - B.2 ) - 11 patient . A new mandibular overdenture metal reinforcement make . The two group patient compare second part study 23 patient receive Locator system abutment ( Group L ) follow research protocol . A new mandibular overdenture metal reinforcement make . The prosthetic procedure perform accord recommendation producer ( Straumann Dental Implant System ) retentive anchor , magnet Locator System experience prosthodontist . The occlusion assess articulator intra-orally secure balance occlusion centric relation without anterior tooth contact .</detailed_description>
