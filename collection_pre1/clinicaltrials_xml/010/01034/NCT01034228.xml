	<brief_summary>Efforts continue improve efficacy oral rehydration solution term reduce severity ( stool volume ) duration diarrhoea ( enhancement recovery ) . Antimicrobial peptide , produce epithelial cell , represent important component innate immunity epithelial surface body include intestine . Induction expression antimicrobial peptide epithelial cell surface , may thus hasten recovery infectious diarrhoea . Isoleucine essential amino acid easily available expensive , addition oral rehydration solution might help early clearance diarrhoeal pathogen induce secretion antimicrobial peptide small intestinal epithelial cell . Additionally , expect hasten recovery diarrhoea reestablish commensal bacteria . The aim pilot study assess addition isoleucine oral rehydration solution induces secretion antimicrobial peptide , help establish normal bacterial population intestine , favourably impact severity duration diarrhoea young child .

	<detailed_description>Globally , diarrhoea still account 1.6 2.5 million death annually , child develop world experience average 3 episode diarrhoea year . Despite decline diarrhoeal mortality , remain leading cause childhood morbidity death [ 1 ] . Prevention dehydration use appropriate home-made fluid ORS solution , correction dehydration use ORS solution intravenous fluid indicate follow maintenance hydration use ORS solution , along continuation usual food include breastfeed important element management acute diarrhea . Antimicrobial therapy recommend management specific etiologic diarrhoea severe cholera , shigellosis , invasive intestinal amoebiasis , symptomatic giardiasis . The cost therapy importantly emergence resistance pathogen major concern antimicrobial therapy diarrhoea bacterial infection . ORS play major role treatment diarrhoeal disease ; however , neither reduce severity duration diarrhoea , major limitation . Efforts continue overcome limitation develop new formulation delivery mechanism e.g . 1 . Changing/replacing substrate ( e.g . addition alanine glycine glucose replace glucose multodextrin rice powder ) 2 . Reducing concentration glucose sodium thus osmolarity ORS solution . Alanine/glycine rice powder contain ORS demonstrate reduction stool output [ 2-5 ] . However , none formulation develop test till date demonstrate beneficial effect duration diarrhoea . Similarly , reduce osmolarity ORS beneficial effect reduce stool output vomit , reduce failure ORT mainly child non-cholera diarrhea , effect diarrhoea duration [ 6 ] . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) United Nations Children Fund ( UNICEF ) recently recommend routine use reduced-osmolarity ORS management diarrhoeal diseases [ 7 ] ; however , scope improve efficacy . Antimicrobial peptide innate immunity Antimicrobial peptides represent important component innate immune defenses organisms range plant insect human . They broad-spectrum , surface-active agent kill microbe form pore membrane . Most broad spectrum activity bacteria , virus fungi . In mammal , two major class antimicrobial peptide described- defensins cathelicidins ( LL-37 ) . The defensins subclass antimicrobial peptide , mammal , present neutrophil granule necessary non-oxidative killing phagocytised microbe [ 8 ] . It well establish defensins also produce virtually epithelial surface mammal , include skin , airway , gut , urogenital tract [ 9 , 10 ] . Expression epithelial defensins constitutive contributes non-inflammatory antimicrobial barrier epithelial surface . Other defensins inducible highly express site inflammation infection [ 9 , 11 , 12 ] . Impairment defensin function increase susceptibility infection airway cystic fibrosis [ 13 ] enhance Salmonella infection mouse intestinal tract [ 14 ] . In addition direct antimicrobial activity , Beta-defensins chemotactic memory T cell dendritic cell , suggest play important role integration innate acquire immune response [ 15 ] . The molecular mechanism underlie induction epithelial defensins remain largely unexplored . Pattern-recognition receptor [ 16 ] likely play critical role process , show CD-14-mediated induction Beta-defensins bacterial lipopolysaccharide [ 17 ] . Whole heat-killed bacteria fungi induce human Beta-defensins-2 human keratinocytes , molecular basis response understand [ 11 ] . Inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor Alpha ( TNF ) IL-10 also induce Beta-defensins [ 18 , 19 ] . Because pharmacological induction defensins epithelial barrier may therapeutic utility , search novel molecule could induce production epithelial defensin , assess use cell-based assay , long underway . It recently observe L-isoleucine analogue highly specific Beta-defensin inducer epithelial cell [ 20 ] . It also observe isoleucine administer animal ( chicken ) , gut flora shift probiotic specie , stimulates paneth cell secrete antimicrobial peptide human intestinal tissue , cause shift gut flora lead increased number Lactobacilli . ( Manuscript , Ashida T &amp; M Zasloff et al ) treatment patient Crohn 's disease . The observation suggest potential role L-isoleucine management infection mucosal tissue include gastrointestinal tract . Antimicrobial peptides Shigella infection In 2001 , researcher ICDDRB Karolinska Institute ( BA ) report Nature Medicine regulation LL-37 human Beta-defensin-1 ( HBD-1 ) epithelial cell diarrhoea cause Shigella dysenteriae type I enteric bacteria [ 21 ] . This regulation could reproduce vitro use cell line U937 monocyte origin HT-29 colonic epithelial origin , infect Shigella plasmid DNA derive Shigella . The regulation important immune escape mechanism pathogens avoid potent mucosal effector molecules antimicrobial peptide . Since antimicrobial factor drench mucosal surface , conceivable pathogenic bacteria down-regulate front line defense human part invasive process . Therefore , novel approach block down-regulation take therapeutic approach up-regulate production endogenous antimicrobial . Recent study show short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) up-regulate expression LL-37 colonic epithelial cell , among sodium butyrate best inducer [ 22 , 23 ] . Moreover , butyrate induces colonic cell differentiation report key determinant LL-37 expression human colon epithelium [ 22 ] . However , show pathway involve cell differentiation involve up-regulation LL-37 butyrate [ 23 ] . Butyrate produce colon fermentation dietary fibre . Thus , link normal gut flora expression endogenous antibiotic . Additionally , SCFAs include butyrate show reduce clinical symptom , alter microbiological pathological feature experimental Shigella infection rabbit model [ 24 ] . Thus , relationship severity Shigella infection mucosal level antimicrobial peptide conceivable . Oral administration sodium butyrate rabbit infect Shigella show up-regulation CAP-18 ( rabbit homologue LL-37 ) colonic epithelial cell concomitant reduction shigella load stool clinical recovery ( Raqib et al , manuscript accept ) . Preventing down-regulation enhance antimicrobial peptide expression could provide alternative treatment protect human animal livestock bacterial pathogen . These study may provide basis therapeutic manipulation endogenous antimicrobial peptide include LL-37 expression vivo use dietary substance butyrate strengthen epithelial defense barrier . Therefore , initiate clinical study ICDDRB evaluate efficacy butyrate enema treatment shigellosis . Butyrate show induce antimicrobial peptide colon ; however ; ca n't administer orally . Moreover , acute diarrhoeal disease cause infection small intestine . Isoleucine , essential amino acid , might reasonable alternative enhance secretion antimicrobial peptide paneth cell defense molecule upper small intestine ( Manuscript , Ashida T &amp; M Zasloff et al ) . This may help clear pathogen , shift gut flora `` normal '' commensal specie distribution , enhance recovery infectious diarrhoea . Therefore , hypothesize use L-isoleucine supplement ORS solution induce antimicrobial peptide enhance clinical recovery child acute watery diarrhoea .</detailed_description>
