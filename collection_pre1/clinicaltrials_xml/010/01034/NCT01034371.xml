	<brief_title>Comparison One-stop Hybrid Revascularization Versus Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Treatment Multi-vessel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- With development specialized device experience , off-pump coronary artery bypass ( OPCAB ) well-established less invasive technique coronary revascularization . Compared conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , OPCAB avoids use cardiopulmonary bypass cardioplegic arrest , associate decreased morbidity , short length stay ICU hospital , less perioperative complication , especially elderly patient severe comorbidities . `` One-stop '' ( also name simultaneous ) hybrid coronary revascularization also novel , safe feasible minimally invasive approach select patient multivessel coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . It allow surgical interventional procedure perform consecutively `` one-stop '' hybrid operate suite , enhance operating room equip radiographic capability , wherein leave intramammary artery ( LIMA ) place leave anterior descend artery ( LAD ) minimally invasive procedure , immediately follow percutaneous coronary intervention/stenting non-LAD lesion . However , study available outcome coronary revascularization new hybrid strategy conventional OPCAB . This study single center randomize clinical trial compare 1-year clinical outcome `` one-stop '' hybrid coronary revascularization OPCAB select patient multivessel CAD suitable coronary anatomy . Sample size : - We examine result SYNTAX trial institution publish previously . The 1-year MACCE rate ( primary endpoint ) estimate 13 % OPCAB . The sample calculate trial 400 patient . Design/Methodology : - Trial design : A single center randomize clinical trial compare `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure versus conventional OPCAB 400 patient suitable anatomy need revascularization . Intervention : Patients randomize undergo either `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure conventional OPCAB . - Randomization : Patients evaluate cardiac surgeon interventional cardiologist . After obtain informed write consent , patient randomize receive `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure conventional OPCAB . An expertise-based randomization use . The data adjudicator blind study . Due nature study , operate surgeon , cardiologist , anesthetist , operative room staff , ICU staff blind study . Study intervention : - Candidates randomize receive `` one-stop '' hybrid procedure conventional OPCAB .</detailed_description>
