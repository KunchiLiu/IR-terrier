	<brief_title>Iron Overload Pediatric Oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term survivor childhood cancer , distinct group require specific follow-up order enhance quality life . Studies show many patient go develop chronic issue within different organ system . Because iron burden frequent transfusion require care patient , iron overload may indeed one problem survivor potentially face . Research primarily thalassemia bone marrow transplant patient extensively transfuse show iron overload significant impact overall health . Complications increase iron burden include growth retardation , gonadal dysfunction , hypothyroidism , impair glucose metabolism , cardiac arrhythmia failure , hepatic fibrosis cirrhosis , increase susceptibility infection . However condition related iron overload prevent use either phlebotomy chelation therapy . Based knowledge , objective determine pediatric oncology transplant patient heavily support transfusion develop consequential biochemical clinical evidence iron overload .</detailed_description>
