	<brief_title>Genetic &amp; Pathological Studies BRCA1/BRCA2 : Associated Tumors &amp; Blood Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To establish demographic database evaluate efficacy medical intervention patient relative carry BRCA1 2 mutation compare outcomes patient carry BRCA1 2 mutation . 2 . To obtain blood sample patient undergo genetic testing ) evaluate incidence genetic modifier polymorphism involve development cancer BRCA1 2 mutation carrier compare incidence non-BRCA 1 2 carrier . b ) understand interaction genetic modifier BRCA1 2 development cancer . c ) determine effect environmental influence incidence polymorphism genetic modifier penetrance BRCA1 2 mutation link information demographic database blood sample 3 . To obtain tumor tissue BRCA1 2 carrier utilize gene expression study . 4 . To establish cohort sporadic breast cancer patient , woman family history cancer first degree relative , serve comparison group woman strong family history breast cancer . 5 . To establish cohort healthy volunteer without personal family history cancer serve comparison group woman sporadic familial breast cancer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>I . Women high risk develop breast ovarian cancer due know germline mutation BRCA1/2 , PTEN , CDH1 , TP53 cancer susceptibility gene , due strong family history either breast ovarian cancer , absence know cancer susceptibility gene mutation . II . Women approach surgery resection pelvic mass , consider suspicious neoplasia radiologic clinical criterion ; woman may may also meet criterion inclusion group I .</criteria>
