	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine relationship cutaneous functional unit ( CFU ) recruitment throughout available active range motion prescribe joint normal subject patient burn scar . Specifically , study determine difference CFU recruitment exist normal subject individual burn scar dorsal hand , dorsal volar forearm , anterior posterior arm active range motion MCP joint flexion , wrist elbow flexion extension , respectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : To establish relationship joint position skin recruitment , express percentage CFU recruit active ROM , patient burn scar normal control . Specific Aim # 2 : To establish within-day between-day reliability percent CFU estimation absolute skin recruitment , measure millimeter fix reference , active ROM specify joint . Specific Aim # 3 : To establish relationship scar height , measure diagnostic ultrasound , scar cross-sectional area , percent CFU recruitment individual burn scar . Specific Aim # 4 : To determine whether amount skin recruitment , express percent CFU recruit active ROM , differentially affected burn scar . Ho : There difference percent CFU recruit completion active range motion specify joint individual burn scar normal control . Ha : Individuals burn scar recruit great percentage CFU order obtain maximal range motion specify joint . Specific Aim # 5 : To determine whether time skin recruitment , express initiation skin movement within CFU relative joint position active ROM , differentially affected burn scar . Ho : There difference initiation skin movement within CFU relative joint position active ROM specify joint individual burn scar normal control . Ha : In individual burn scar give CFU , skin movement far joint axis occur early range motion compare control . Specific Aim # 6 : To determine whether skin extensibility within CFU active ROM specify joint differentially affected burn scar . Ho : There difference skin extensibility within CFU active ROM specify joint individual burn scar normal control . Ha : In individual burn scar give CFU , skin near joint axis undergoes great deformation ( stretch ) range motion joint increase compare control .</detailed_description>
