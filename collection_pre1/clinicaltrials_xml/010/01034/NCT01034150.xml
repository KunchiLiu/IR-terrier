	<brief_title>Effects Home-based Neurostimulation Associated With Motor Training Chronic Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Double-blind , randomize , control clinical trial . Setting : Home-based rehabilitation . Subjects : Patients chronic phase ( &gt; 6 month ) stroke . Interventions : Patients randomize active control group . In group , treatment perform home , daily , four week . Patients active group instruct use device provide somatosensory stimulation form electrical stimulation median nerve two hour . Patients control group also instruct use device two hour , sham stimulation administer . In group , patient instruct train activity paretic hand immediately nerve stimulation . Main measure : The primary outcome improvement performance paretic hand evaluate Jebsen-Taylor test end treatment four month end treatment , compare baseline . Secondary outcome : 1 ) Compliance intervention , assess daily write log , oral report patient ; 2 ) safety profile intervention .</detailed_description>
