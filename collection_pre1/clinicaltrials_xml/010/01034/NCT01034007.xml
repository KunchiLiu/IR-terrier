	<brief_summary>An initial feasibility safety study evaluate use autologous tissue engineer vascular graft extra cardiac total cavopulmonary connection ( EC TCPC ) conduits child single ventricle anomaly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Investigating Clinical Use Tissue Engineered Vascular Grafts Congenital Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation prospective , nonrandomized phase 1 clinical trial determine safety use tissue engineer vascular graft conduit EC TCPC . Primary end point study include determination graft failure rate graft relate morbidity mortality . Graft failure define graft narrowing/occlusion dilation/rupture require surgical endovascular intervention . Graft related morbidity mortality include post-operative complication thromboembolic infectious event require treatment think likely cause tissue engineer vascular graft determine investigator confirm data safety monitor board . All appropriate patient require EC TCPC meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion evaluate enrollment clinical trial . After obtain informed consent patient 's parent , patient single ventricle cardiac anomaly undergo EC TCPC use tissue engineer conduit . Post-operative care monitor follow establish , standardize , clinical algorithm patient 's clinical status include complication measurement graft function serially evaluate record three year period use physical examination , echocardiography , MRA .</detailed_description>
