	<brief_summary>Females participate cut land sport suffer anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries 2 10-fold great rate male participate high-risk sport . Fifty 100 percent ACL injure female suffer osteoarthritis injured knee within one two decade injury . External knee abduction moment ( LOAD ) predict ACL injury high sensitivity specificity female athlete . Control lateral trunk motion ( LTM ) also predict ACL injury similar level sensitivity specificity female athlete . These predictor may link , lateral position trunk create high knee abduction load via biomechanical neuromuscular mechanism . The mechanism ACL injury female include high knee LOAD high LTM , majority body weight shift injured limb foot position lateral body 's center mass . An unanticipated perturbation also often contributor injury mechanism . LTM may result increased knee LOAD increase lateral position magnitude GRF vector ( ΔGRFv ) increase reactive hip adductor torque ( HAdT ) . Our long-term objective determine mechanism cause ACL injury female athlete develop neuromuscular training ( NMT ) intervention specifically target mechanism . If objective proposal achieve , evidence-based NMT intervention develop make available nationally effectively efficiently reduce ACL injury risk high-risk female athlete . The major goal proposal determine increase LTM increase coronal plane knee load high-risk group female athlete . This application test central hypothesis LTM increase knee LOAD NMT target toward increase coronal plane control trunk motion decrease knee LOAD females moderate high knee LOAD . Aim 1 design determine mechanism trunk motion may increase knee LOAD female athlete . Coronal plane control trunk ( LTM ) examine relative ΔGRFv , HAdT knee LOAD . We determine increase LTM increase knee LOAD biomechanical ( increased ΔGRFv ) and/or neuromuscular ( increased relative HAdT ) mechanism may underlie increased LOAD female athlete . The central hypothesis Aim 1 increase LTM increase knee LOAD female athlete increase ΔGRFv , increase HAdT via combination mechanism cut landing . We hypothesize female neither mechanism low knee LOAD , increase ΔGRFv HAdT moderate LOAD increase ΔGRFv HAdT high knee LOAD . Aim 2 design determine NMT decrease coronal plane trunk motion decrease knee LOAD knee load group cluster randomize controlled trial . The central hypothesis Aim 2 NMT decrease knee LOAD moderate LOAD group decrease ΔGRFv HAdT decrease LOAD great extent high LOAD group decrease ΔGRFv HAdT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Specific Aim 1 Determine mechanism trunk motion increase knee load female . Rationale Aim 1 Knee external abduction moment ( LOAD ) lateral trunk motion ( LTM ) know strong predictor ACL injury risk female athlete , know whether predictor link athlete increase risk . In addition , know specific neuromuscular mechanism predispose athlete great risk injury . Neuromuscular control trunk examine relative GRF position magnitude , hip torque knee LOAD . We determine increase ΔGRFv increase relative hip adductor torque ( HAdT ) underlie increase knee LOAD female . Central Hypothesis Aim 1 Lateral trunk motion increase knee LOAD female athlete increase ΔGRFv , increased HAdT combination two mechanism cut landing . Hypothesis 1.1 . Increased LTM induce unanticipated lateral cut increase knee LOAD increase ΔGRFv , adjust HAdT , female athlete . Hypothesis 1.2 . Increased LTM induce single-leg medial drop land increase knee LOAD increase HAdT , adjust ΔGRFv , female athlete . Hypothesis 1.3 . Increased LTM induce combined drop landing unanticipated lateral cut result combinatorial increase knee LOAD increase ΔGRFv HAdT female athlete . Hypothesis 1.4 Females low ΔGRFv , low HAdT , low knee LOAD form distinct group cluster subject , high ΔGRFv HAdT moderate LOAD form another cluster , high ΔGRFv , high HAdT high LOAD form last distinct group use data collect DLUC . 2 . Specific Aim 2 Determine NMT decrease coronal plane trunk motion decrease knee abduction LOAD double-blind cluster ( school team ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Rationale Aim 2 This aim determine NMT target LTM two knee load mechanism , ΔGRFv HAdT , affect knee LOAD low , moderate high LOAD subgroup female athlete . Central Hypotheses Aim 2 NMT increase control coronal plane trunk motion decrease knee LOAD either mechanical ( ΔGRFv ) , neuromuscular ( HAdT ) mechanisms pre-test low , moderate high knee LOAD subgroup female athlete demonstrate differential effect NMT . Hypothesis 2.1 Knee LOAD low train untrained female land cut . Hypothesis 2.2 Post-test knee LOAD differ train high , moderate low knee LOAD subgroup . Hypothesis 2.3 Post-test ΔGRFv HAdT differ train high , moderate low LOAD subgroup . Hypothesis 2.3 Post-test knee LOAD , ΔGRFv HAdT value differ pre-test value untrained high , moderate low knee LOAD subgroup .

Specific Aims The Specific Aims modify original application . Our long-term goal determine mechanisms female athletes become susceptible ACL injury develop intervention address mechanisms order reduce knee load ACL injury risk . The major goal proposal determine decrease neuromuscular control trunk increase coronal plane knee load high-risk group female . This overall objective application test central hypothesis lateral trunk motion increase knee load neuromuscular training increase control trunk motion decrease knee abduction load female moderate high knee load . Our rationale project successful completion provide strong , evidence-based intervention effectively decrease ACL injury risk high-risk female athlete . B . Studies Results We continue utilize prospective randomize controlled design Specific Aims 1 2 outline original funded application . The Boone County Superintendent Boone County School Board approve participation ( test , busing , randomize intervention , etc ) school system ' girl ' athletic program ( Basketball , Soccer Volleyball ) monthly school board meeting Thursday , June 11 , 2009 pre-testing begin September 1 , 2009 . As outlined , school-sponsored basketball , soccer volleyball team Boone County , Kentucky school system almost completely recruit , test track . Testing complete December 31 , 2010 . Female subject county high school junior high school screen prior start basketball soccer volleyball season . A total 23 team yield 318 basketball player pre-screened trained post-screened September 1 , 2009 April 30 , 2010 . A total 29 team approximately 306 soccer volleyball player ( 31 new athlete test prior basketball season ) pre-screened , trained post-screened May 2010 December 2010 . We face challenge recruit soccer player junior high school level county school system . Some junior high school organize soccer team . We address challenge recruit volleyball team within county order fill randomize block . In addition , capture athlete go play high school soccer , volleyball basketball within Fayette county school system ( see supplement summary ) . Thus far , enrol pretested ( N=31 test season ) test total 593 athlete randomize control trial 9/1/09 12/31/10 . The breakdown sport school level summarize Enrollment Table . There 558 athlete make cut respective team randomize cluster ( team ) intervention . This number include athlete complete least 1 intervention training session . For initial biomechanical analysis , choose focus Hypothesis 1.4 use Latent Profile Analysis ( LPA ) . We use LPA examine whether cluster subject similar characteristic GRFv , HAdT , hip moment ( minimum maximum ) , lateral trunk motion center gravity displacement distinct neuromuscular profile . Our latent profile analysis evaluate independent variable across multiple task form group girls similar neuromuscular pattern variable heterogeneity response pattern minimize within profile maximize across profile . Initially , two profile specify LPA model , , stepwise fashion , number profile specify increased one . At step , change Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) , adjust sample size , use assess model fit identify number profile need . The point number profile deem adequate significant drop BIC see profile number increase . In addition , Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjust likelihood ratio test use determine optimal number profile . ( Lo 2001 ) The analysis implement use Mplus 5 . ( Muthen 2007 ) Validation profile group include examination independent predictor LOAD . Analysis begin profile create pre-test movement . Graphs depict standardized mean along 2 generalized profile show Figure 1 . For presentation purpose necessary show standardize value variable different scale , hugely vary mean value . Due underlie normality assumption , necessary transform lateral trunk motion variable loge scale . In addition , necessary account correlation variable ; particular maximum hip moment GRFv HAdT . We continue examine potential LPA model time check post intervention data determine emergent profile . Comparison mean KAM , without adjustment age pubertal status profile also focus future analysis . Figure 1 . Profile analysis Pre-Test Data Set ( N=457 ) In addition , perform initial assessment efficacy Randomized control intervention present initial result ( The effect Trunk focus Neuromuscular train Hip Strength ) national meeting come July .</detailed_description>
