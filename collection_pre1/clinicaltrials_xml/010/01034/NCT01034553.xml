	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) combination MLN8237 bortezomib . ( Phase I ) II . To describe toxicity associate combination MLN8237 bortezomib . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate overall response rate combination MLN8237 bortezomib patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To assess progression-free survival patient treated combination . ( Phase II ) II . To assess overall survival patient treated combination . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive oral aurora kinase inhibitor MLN8237 daily day 1-14 bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 11 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment patient follow every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
