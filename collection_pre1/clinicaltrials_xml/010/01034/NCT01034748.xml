	<criteria>Healthy male subject age 18 55 year , inclusive ( Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test . ) Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 17.5 30.5 kg/m2 ; total body weight &gt; 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . An informed consent document sign date subject . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic disease ( include drug allergy , exclude untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy ) . A positive urine drug screen . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 14 drinks/week male ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month screen . Use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 3 month screen positive urine cotinine test Screening . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day ( determined local requirement , whichever long ) 5 half life precede first dose study medication . 12 lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 msec Screening . If QTc exceed 450 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc value use determine subject 's eligibility . Subjects enrol previous radionucleotide study receive radiotherapy within 12 month prior screen total radioactivity would exceed acceptable dosimetry . Subjects whose occupation require exposure radiation monitoring radiation exposure . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement within 7 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication . Herbal supplement must discontinue 28 day prior first dose study medication . As exception , acetaminophen/paracetamol may use dos 1 g/day . Limited use non prescription medication believe affect subject safety overall result study may permit casebycase basis follow approval sponsor . Blood donation approximately 1 pint ( 500 mL ) within 56 day prior dose . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Subject investigator sub investigator , research assistant , pharmacist , study coordinator , staff , relative study personnel directly involve conduct study . Subjects believe unable and/or unlikely comprehend follow trial protocol . Subjects history irregular bowel movement eg , regular episode diarrhea constipation , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) lactose intolerance . Unwilling unable comply Lifestyle guideline describe protocol . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
