	<brief_summary>Global Objective : To improve quality life reduce stress breast cancer survivor . To address late-term long-term effect breast cancer treatment , define Institute Medicine , include chemo brain , fatigue , sleep deprivation , stress , anxiety , depression , PTSD . Phase II Aims : ( 1 ) To demonstrate clinical efficacy ( i.e. , improve quality life , stress reduction , participant satisfaction product ) `` Envision Rhythms Life '' program ( 2 ) establish technical merit program 's distance-delivery ( videoconferencing hardware software ) instructional technology ( i.e. , animation , graphically enhance PowerPoint instructional material , full-color program manual , art-as-imagery , audio-imagery ) . `` Envision Rhythms Life '' instruct breast cancer survivor practice individualize , emotionally supportive , biologically accurate imagery consist 5 , 4-hour long , interactive class between-class instructor support . Instructional Options : Option 1 delivers program technology ( animation , PowerPoint , manual , art , audio-art ) instructor participant room . Option 2 delivers program at-a-distance , small group , via videoconferencing software camera system ( Alaska Seattle ) low , moderate high bandwidth area . Each option delivers program three time ( total 45 participant option ) . A website portal provide program information material . Design Method : Program deliver 135 breast cancer survivor complete conventional care ( surgery , radiation , IV chemotherapy ) least six week . Differences option 1 2 outcome compare control ; combine outcome option 1 2 compare control ; waitlist control outcome compare extended baseline . Hypothesis : Options 1 2 produce significantly well outcome waitlist control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESCRIPTION : To improve quality life reduce stress breast cancer survivor . Phase II Aims : ( 1 ) To demonstrate clinical efficacy ( i.e. , improve quality life , stress reduction , participant satisfaction product ) `` Envision Rhythms Life '' program ( 2 ) establish technical merit program 's distance-delivery ( videoconferencing hardware software ) instructional technology ( i.e. , animation , graphically enhance PowerPoint instructional material , full-color program manual , art-as-imagery , audio-imagery ) . `` Envision Rhythms Life '' instruct breast cancer survivor practice individualize , emotionally supportive , biologically accurate imagery consist 5 , 3-hour long , interactive class between-class instructor support . Instructional Options : Option 1 delivers program technology ( animation , PowerPoint , manual , art , audio-art ) instructor 15 participant room . Option 2 delivers program at-a-distance , small group 15 , via videoconferencing software camera system ( Alaska Seattle ) low , moderate high bandwidth area . Each option delivers program three time ( total 45 participant option ) . A website portal provide program information material . Design Method : Program deliver 135 breast cancer survivor complete conventional care ( surgery , radiation , IV chemotherapy ) least six week . Differences option 1 2 outcome compare control ; combine outcome option 1 2 compare control ; waitlist control outcome compare extended baseline . Long-Term Objectives : This innovative project integrate technology bandwidth-sensitive multi-media conferencing strategy deliver virtual mind-body , imagery intervention . The technology allow seamless program delivery interested survivor across country Phase III . Instructional technology , design per Phase I participant feedback , serve ` jump-start ' potent imagery practice optimize clinical efficacy . Commercial application survivor participation limit location , work schedule , health status , address issue barrier access care . Although desirable , instructional option 1 2 require survivor computer skill internet access . The program design culturally sensitive support individual spiritual practice . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : This program address NCI IOM summary report call individualize supportive care cancer survivor suffer disease-related distress . Changes two disease-education program module would allow program use supportive therapy form cancer across country .</detailed_description>
