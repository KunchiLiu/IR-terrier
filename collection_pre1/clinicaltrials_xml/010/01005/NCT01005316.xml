	<detailed_description>There currently renew interest allo-antibodies transplantation . In 1966 , Kissmeyer colleague report pre-existing antibody direct donor cell could cause hyperacute rejection renal allograft . Three year later , landmark study , Patel Terasaki show lymphocytotoxic assay identify donor-specific antibody highly predictive acute graft failure . These observation lead practice perform prospective , donor-specific cross-matches lymphocytotoxicity assay kidney transplant heart lung transplant candidate positive panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) assay . A concept evolve transplantation perform across positive cytotoxicity cross-match . The purpose study determine clinical outcome sensitize pediatric heart transplant recipient positive donor-specific cytotoxicity cross-match compare outcomes nonsensitized heart transplant recipient . This study enroll 370 pediatric heart transplant recipient period 3 year . The follow-up period last 3 year . All participant enrol pretransplant . In pretransplant phase , visit occur every 6 month . These routine visit continue transplant end study . They coincide routine pretransplant status visit . At time transplant , participant assign one two group . Group A include participant allo-antibody negative ( less 10 % AHG CDC-PRA ELISA DTT-treated serum sample ) . Cohort B include participant presence DTT-treated AHG CDC-PRA great equal 10 % and/or ELISA-PRA great equal 10 % pretransplant sample . Both cohort receive standard transplantation care . This study intervention . All participant undergo regular blood test , , sensitize group additional blood test perform transplant lasting end study . Post-transplant visit occur participant recover hospital ; Months 1 , 3 , 6 ; annually study close . The information collect study include data physical exam , routine testing , adverse ( AEs ) serious adverse ( SAEs ) event assessment , blood collection . Each time biopsy do , study ask review biopsy tissue collect sample . If store tissue available , none collect .</detailed_description>
