	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect give intensity-modulated radiation therapy together cisplatin bevacizumab follow carboplatin cisplatin see well work treat patient undergone surgery high-risk endometrial cancer . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , carboplatin , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy together chemotherapy bevacizumab surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To assess treatment-related , grade 3+ , non-hematologic adverse-event rate within 90 day start treatment concurrent intensity-modulated radiotherapy , cisplatin , bevacizumab follow carboplatin paclitaxel patient high-risk endometrial cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate treatment-related adverse event occur within 1 year start treatment . II . To evaluate treatment-related adverse event . III . To evaluate disease-free overall survival . IV . To evaluate local , regional , distant failure . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily , 5 day week , 5 week . Patients may also undergo optional nodal boost radiotherapy and/or vaginal brachytherapy boost . Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 29 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 . Beginning 4-6 week complete IMRT , cisplatin , bevacizumab , patient receive carboplatin IV 1 hour paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment carboplatin paclitaxel repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
