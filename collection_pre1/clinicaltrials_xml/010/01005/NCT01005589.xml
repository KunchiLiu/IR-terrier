	<brief_summary>Bacterial infection major cause death newborn infant . And link complication include : sepsis ( exaggerated immune response infection ) necrotising enterocolitis ( potentially fatal inflammatory bowel disease ) . Detecting infection early stage difficult newborn sign symptom non-specific , commonly use lab test culture sample blood , urine spinal fluid try grow identify bacteria present ; however test take 24-48 hour give result , mean neonate present sign infection prescribe broad spectrum antibiotic whilst result obtain . The lack test detect infection early stage give rapid result one major problem diagnosis management infection newborn . This study investigate neutrophil , white blood cell important fight infection . When neutrophil detect infection become activate , produce protein call CD64 ( cell marker ) surface , protein want measure . Neutrophils produce CD64 protein within 1 hour first detect infection , could hopefully detect treat infection much quicker . The hypothesis study test : 1 . Does neutrophil membrane CD64 measurement provide highly sensitive specific marker infection neonate AND : 2 . Does neutrophil membrane CD64 measurement provide highly sensitive specific marker NEC neonate</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>New born infant ( neonate ) particularly premature infant risk develop bacterial infection due number different factor include immature immune system , likely need invasive procedure chest drain increase potential infection . The sign infection baby non-specific difficult diagnose . Undetected infection treat quickly lead sepsis , over-exaggerated response immune system spread throughout whole body attack 'self ' tissue lead organ failure death . It therefore vital infection neonate diagnose quickly order administer best treatment . The current 'gold standard ' laboratory test detect infection culture sample blood , urine spinal fluid , allow bacteria present grown lab identify . However test take 24-48 hour give result , due devastate consequence treat infection neonate common practice prescribe broad spectrum antibiotic neonate present sign infection await test result . This study look happen white blood cell make part immune defence infection encounter infection . One type white blood cell particularly important fight bacterial infection call neutrophil , detects infection , becomes activated order fight ; activation process express protein marker call CD64 surface . The CD64 protein express within hour onset bacterial infection , measure CD64 marker could provide much fast result laboratory test currently available . If could detect infection neonate rapidly non-infected neonate ( negative CD64 result ) could antibiotic treatment stop . This beneficial reduces unnecessary treatment therefore reduce hospital stay cost . It also reduce use antibiotic , overuse promote development antibiotic resistant strain bacteria , colonize entire ward . It would also mean infected neonate could receive appropriate care , example specific antibiotic . Necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC ) another common condition affect newborn infant . Exactly infants develop NEC still unclear , think due number different factor include bacterial infection . Advanced NEC characterise bowel necrosis , bowel perforation , sepsis death remain one major cause morbidity death neonate , mortality rate 30-50 % . The diagnosis NEC currently base X-ray finding feature air abdomen diagnostic . Other biochemical haematological parameter also use support X-ray finding . Because know one 'triggers ' initiation disease bacterial infection : culturing sample blood , urine spinal fluid important try identify/isolate infection . However test take time , current practice mean neonate present sign NEC/infection subject gut rest i.e . nil mouth ( order prevent damage gut ) also prescribe broad spectrum antibiotic . Patients suspect NEC often continue treatment/monitoring regime , length dictate clinical judgment : may unnecessary sign infection/inflammation . One great challenge management/diagnosis NEC lack early , reliable consistent marker 'intestinal inflammation ' peripheral blood . This study investigate CD64 marker fill gap . The inflammatory process see NEC probably initiate presence bacteria . The bacteria activate cell innate immune system produce number inflammatory mediator cause inflammation . The CD64 marker 'direct ' marker inflammation , however cell activate order produce inflammation i.e . neutrophil positive CD64 activate , therefore CD64 present cell : activate , mean infection therefore inflammation . If CD64 marker rule infection neonate suspect NEC , also rule ongoing inflammatory process . Clinicians could use CD64 assay conjunction X-ray finding order stop treatment non affect neonate restart feed sooner , many benefit neonate 's growth nutritional development , also negate need prolong antibiotic treatment hospital stay . It also mean affected neonate could receive appropriate treatment monitoring . Taking serial ( repeat ) measurement patient suspect confirmed NEC various interval ( 24 48 hour etc . ) see compare clinical picture , could possibly use monitor disease progression/severity e.g . could rapid rise expression CD64 indicate progression advance stage need surgery , could reduce expression CD64 indicate remission response treatment .</detailed_description>
