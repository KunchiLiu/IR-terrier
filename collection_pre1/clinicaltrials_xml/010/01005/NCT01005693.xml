	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess feasibility apply screening tool ( Groningen Frailty Indicator [ GFI ] G8 ) relationship treatment outcome old patient cancer undergo standard treatment versus geriatric intervention . - To compare screening tool ( GFI G8 ) comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) . - To evaluate predictive value screen tool undergo standard anticancer treatment term toxicity . - To identify patient benefit geriatric intervention order able undergo standard anticancer treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . All patient complete screen questionnaire ( GFI , G8 , standardize CGA consist ADL ( Katz index ) IADL ; Timed Up Go ; Cancer Leukemia Group B adaptation Charlson Co-morbidity ; Mini Nutritional Assessment ; RAND Social Support Survey Instrument ; Folstein Mini Mental State Examination ; Geriatric Depression Scale ) start anticancer treatment , prior course treatment , 1 month treatment . Patients also undergo physical cognitive performance measure trained member research team . Patients assign group base fitness treatment . They may reassign round assessment . - Group 1 ( fit undergo standard treatment ) : Patients undergo standard treatment . - Group 2 ( vulnerable ) : Patients receive specialize care individualize treatment . - Group 3 ( frail ) : Patients receive palliative care anticancer chemotherapy target agent . Patients ' medical history , vital sign , performance status , physical examination , body weight obtain record . In patient receive anticancer treatment , adverse event grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI-CTC ) record serious adverse event report accord European Rules .</detailed_description>
