	<brief_summary>Background : - Endocrine neoplasm ( tumor ) among fast grow tumor incidence United States . Furthermore , often difficult distinguish benign malignant tumor cancer thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal gland , pancreas . More research need improve detection treatment option patient develop kind cancer . - Researchers interested study molecular change involve endocrine cancer development growth . To collect sample tumor specimens healthy tissue study , researcher specifically look sample patient schedule surgery biopsy endocrine tumor . Objectives : - To collect sample precancerous , cancerous , healthy tissue individual schedule surgery biopsy endocrine system tumor . Eligibility : - Individuals tumor around thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal gland , pancreas , neuroendocrine tissue , schedule surgery National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Design : - Participants study provide blood urine sample prior surgery . - During surgery biopsy , piece tumor precancerous growth piece normal tissue near tumor remove ongoing future research . The rest tumor growth send analysis . - After surgery , participant receive routine care discharge , doctor discuss possible treatment option . If appropriate NIH protocol , participant may choose treated NIH . - After discharge , participant return clinic routine postoperative check 6 week follow operation , may follow yearly Clinical Center phone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Endocrine neoplasm among fast grow tumor incidence United States . Between 1995 2005 , incidence thyroid carcinoma increase 98 percent . - Tumors thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal gland pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor among difficult tumor clinically histopathologically distinguish benign malignant . - Moreover , endocrine neoplasm provide extremely important model study important molecular change lead carcinogenesis diverse clinical behavior , even TNM stage histologic feature . - The Endocrine Surgery Section Surgery Branch , NCI focus study molecular change involve Endocrine Cancer initiation progression . In addition , section primary responsibility provide endocrine surgery consultative service NIH . As , Section uniquely position acquire perform important study endocrine tissue help identify diagnostic predictive marker , well , therapeutic target may significant clinical ramification . Some patient enrol study may protocols throughout NIH , Section consult order perform operation . Objectives : Primary Objective : - To develop genetic epigenetic , metabolomic , proteomic profile endocrine neoplasm allow u distinguish benign malignant tumor endocrine histology study . This objective drive statistical endpoint study . Secondary Objectives : - To utilize tissue obtain endocrine neoplasms study gene expression epigenetic ( methylation ) change , metabolite protein expression . - To obtain , accessible , normal endocrine adjacent tissue comparison neoplastic tissue . - To collect tissue endocrine neoplasms arise thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , pancreas , extraadrenal neuroendocrine rest future analysis correlation clinical outcome . Eligibility : - Patients radiographic evidence , biochemical evidence , histologically/cytologically proven , endocrine neoplasm , include lesion thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , extra-adrenal endocrine rest , paragangliomas , neuroblastomas pancreas . patient describe pre potentially malignant condition require surgery biopsy part standard care treatment and/or follow . - Patients must ECOG performance score 0-2 . - Patients must laboratory physical examination parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior biopsy surgery . Design : - A tissue acquisition trial tissue obtain time surgical operation removal neoplasms thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , pancreas , paragangliomas extraadrenal rest neuroendocrine tissue . - At time surgical operation , blood sample obtain operative field removal neoplasms thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , pancreas , paragangliomas extraadrenal neuroendocrine tissue . - Tissue blood process time collection , store transfer Dr. Kebebew laboratory processing . - No investigational therapy give . - It anticipated 1350 patient enrol period 16 year .</detailed_description>
