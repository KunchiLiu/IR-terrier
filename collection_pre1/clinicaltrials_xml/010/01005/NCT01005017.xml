	<brief_summary>Chronic pancreatitis progressive inflammatory disease result slow destruction pancreas . This chronic inflammation lead chronic abdominal pain last many year . Unfortunately , medical management often limited benefit treat pain chronic pancreatitis . Management patient intractable pain difficult , often result narcotic addiction . Early result small group patient suggest percutaneous radiofrequent lesioning splanchnic nerve good potential pain control subset patient chronic pancreatitis . Given simplicity procedure , clearly warrant reappraisal identify current role pancreatic pain management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Lesioning Splanchnic Nerves Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Pain control press problem patient chronic pancreatitis . Many method advocate control pain . Unfortunately , method fail control pain 20-50 % patient . Management patient intractable pain difficult , often result narcotic addiction . Percutaneous alcoholic block celiac plexus , risk paralysis catastrophic haemorrhage result injury major abdominal vasculature , restrict patient intractable , severe pain due terminal pancreatic cancer . Splanchnic nerve lesioning useful alternative celiac plexus block management patient chronic upper abdominal pain . The predictable relationship splanchnic nerve structure allow accurate needle placement hence low risk damage . Radiofrequent lesioning us high frequency alternate current heat tissue lead thermal coagulation . It produce predictable accurate lesion . Objective : To evaluate feasibility efficacy percutaneous radiofrequent lesioning splanchnic nerve ( PRFLSN ) patient pain caused chronic pancreatitis . The primary goal determine 50 % reduction pain achieve least 3 month . Secondary objective reduction medication use improvement quality life . Design : Single blind , prerandomized intervention study . Study population : Patients pain ( NRS &gt; 5 ) cause chronic pancreatitis , despite optimal medical treatment . Intervention : One group receive PRFLSN positive trial block bupivacaine , group receive extra treatment besides optimal medical treatment . Main study endpoint : The percentage reduction pain PRFLSN period least 3 month preferably one year .</detailed_description>
