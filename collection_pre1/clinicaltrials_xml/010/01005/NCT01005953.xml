	<detailed_description>Project Summary : SymTrend seek funding bring low-cost , technology-afforded power efficiency special education ( SPED ) low function child autism ( LFCA ) . Each LFCA federally mandate , individualize education plan ( IEP ) . An effective IEP require intensive school home-based behavioral monitoring : iteration behavioral data recording , progress charting , team communication . SymTrend extend functionality current Internet mobile system behavioral monitoring include use digital pen technology record specially print form . The project test two type electronic monitoring ( iPod Touch digital pen ) current pencil paper monitoring . It hypothesize electronic system four component - i.e. , form creation , data collection , progress charting , team communication - reduce time burden behavioral monitoring enable school meet IEP need student within constraint restrictive educational budget . Objectives : The three objective project 1 ) design implement four-component behavioral monitor IEPs easy-to-use , cost-sensitive , power efficiency optimize sustain behavioral improvement LFCA ; 2 ) incorporate functionality extensive range ) learning context , b ) type behavioral measurement , c ) progress chart format meet IEP reporting requirement ; 3 ) contrast electronic behavioral monitor standard paper method term : ) efficiency , b ) power , c ) acceptance . Design Methods : The test system include sample 15 child participate one two public school system . LFCA monitor parent one type professional school home . Monitoring occur context skill learn disruptive behavior elimination . Professionals keep track time effort behavioral recording , chart , communicate member IEP team . The research design include within-subject comparison baseline paper monitoring versus electronic monitoring term efficiency , power , acceptance . Significance : The electronic behavioral monitoring system create support IEP use LFCA also use high functioning child autism ( HFCA ) , developmental disability ( e. g. , ADHD ) , clinical us ( e.g. , depression anxiety ) , academic use ( e.g. , university level behavioral science ) commercial use ( e.g. , human factor study ) .</detailed_description>
