	<detailed_description>Patients obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) include prospective control trial . OSA patient unable tolerate CPAP refuse CPAP ( Continuous positive airway pressure ) ( deem appropriate attend physician dental device treatment OSA randomize control group ( MAD treatment ) active MAD therapy . Epidemiologic study suggest OSA associate insulin resistance independent know risk factor obesity . The cyclic intermittent hypoxia OSA primary stimulus lead insulin resistance , primary risk factor development type 2 diabetes . There association level hypoxic stress OSA insulin resistance . The overall hypothesis test treatment OSA MAD improve insulin sensitivity , increase level HMW ( High-molecular- weight ) adiponectin , improve psychological adjustment .</detailed_description>
