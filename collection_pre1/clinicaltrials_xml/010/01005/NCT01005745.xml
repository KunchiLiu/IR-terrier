	<brief_title>Lymphodepletion Plus Adoptive Cell Transfer With High Dose IL-2 Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients offer admission study test side effect investigational treatment prepared special immune cell ( T cell ) specific melanoma . A T-cell type lymphocyte . Lymphocytes type white blood cell protect people viral infection ; help cell fight bacterial fungal infection ; produce antibody ; fight cancer ; coordinate activity cell immune system . These special immune cell take sample patient 's tumor tissue surgically remove body grown laboratory . They give back patient vein . These cell call tumor infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) . We wish study side effect TIL give two chemotherapy drug temporarily decrease patient 's immune cell drug call Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . The two chemotherapy drug call fludarabine cytoxan use greatly reduce number normal lymphocytes circulate patient 's body , call lymphodepletion , `` space '' cancer fight lymphocyte ( T-cells ) infuse vein . We wish find often cell shrink slow growth patient 's melanoma . We also wish find effect lymphodepletion follow TIL high dose IL-2 patient 's immune system . The lymphodepletion follow TIL high dose IL-2 experimental , proven help treat melanoma . The IL-2 approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic melanoma surgically remove . The chemotherapy drug cytoxan fludarabine use lymphodepletion approve FDA , treatment metastatic melanoma . The combination lymphodepletion follow TIL high dose IL-2 FDA approve FDA permit use study .</detailed_description>

At screening , patient ≤ 3 untreated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases may include provide none untreated lesion &gt; 1 cm great dimension , peritumoral edema present brain imaging ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] compute tomography [ CT ] MRI contraindicate ) . At screening , patient CNS metastases treat either surgical resection and/or radiation therapy may include . Patients may include large lesion ≤ 1 cm , evidence progressive CNS disease brain image least 28 day treatment . At screening , patient may include large lesion &gt; 1 cm &gt; 3 number , evidence progressive CNS disease brain image least 90 day treatment surgery and/or radiation therapy . All laboratory image study must complete satisfactory within 30 day sign consent document . Patients active systemic infection require intravenous antibiotic , coagulation disorder major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system exclude . Patients test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) titre , Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis C antibody , Human Tlymphotropic virus ( HTLV ) I II antibody , rapid plasma reagent ( RPR ) fluorescein treponemal antibody ( FTA ) positive exclude .
