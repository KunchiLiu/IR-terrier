	<brief_summary>Purpose - To determine effectiveness custom-fit pressure garment therapy prevention hypertrophic scarring heal burn . Background - Approximately one million people burned year United States . The devastate outcome follow burn ugly , itchy , hypertrophic scar interferes work aspect life . Pressure garment therapy routinely use minimize hypertrophic scar even though scientifically valid data therapy efficacious . Pressure garment extremely unattractive , expensive uncomfortable use need base upon valid data . Goals Objectives - The investigator plan determine effectiveness pressure garment therapy control hypertrophic scar heal burn . Methods - The I-ScanÂ® device design measure pressure body/environment interface allow clinician deal pressure-related problem at-risk patient . It widely use rehabilitation medicine burn survivor . The investigator use device measure pressure garment/skin interface . 2 ) Furthermore , study attempt determine efficacy use subject design . Since burn depth extremely variable patient patient since hypertrophic scar greatly influence age race/origin , subject design require large number subject .
