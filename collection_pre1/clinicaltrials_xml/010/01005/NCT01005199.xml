	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib tosylate everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give sorafenib tosylate together everolimus see well work compare sorafenib tosylate alone treat patient localize , unresectable , metastatic liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate With Without Everolimus Treating Patients With Localized , Unresectable , Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine sorafenib tosylate versus without everolimus stop tumor progression patient localize , unresectable , metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma . - To evaluate change symptom-related global quality life ( QL ) QL benefit course trial treatment patient . - To compare primary endpoint ( i.e. , progression-free survival week 12 ) QL benefit within 12 week baseline . - To evaluate symptom-related global QL indicator map single summary index derive standardized measure health status utility cost analysis . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord WHO performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , disease spread ( extrahepatic spread v non-extrahepatic spread ) , center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm A ( standard treatment ) : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily 4 week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm B ( investigational treatment ) : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily oral everolimus daily 4 week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient may undergo CT scan MRI baseline 6 12 week study assess tumor response , tumor size , tumor density . Patients complete quality life questionnaire baseline every 2 week 12 week study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
