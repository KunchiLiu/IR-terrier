	<detailed_description>Recent study human genetics discover several interval human genome contain inherit variant statistically associate propensity develop solid tumor . Even though firmly establish individual carry DNA variant increase chance develop solid tumor underlie biological mechanism association largely unknown . In addition inherit DNA variant associate development solid tumor well establish development growth solid tumor DNA cancer cell undergo somatic change ( mutation ) . These somatic DNA change study past decade frequently specific chromosomal translocation amplification associate development particular solid tumor . In instance , examine chromosomal translocation amplification lead discovery proteins contribute solid tumor pathology . human 8q24 interval strong genetic association solid tumor development also note frequently amplify solid tumor serve predictor poor survival prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
