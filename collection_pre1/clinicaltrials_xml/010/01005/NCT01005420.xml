	<brief_title>The Effect Blueberries Enhancing Insulin Sensitivity Humans : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance key pathophysiologic feature `` metabolic syndrome '' strongly associate co-existing cardiovascular risk factor accelerate atherosclerosis . Due clinical consequence associate insulin resistance subject metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes , clinical regimen direct increase insulin sensitivity vivo remain one desirable goal treatment . Although well establish lifestyle modification improve insulin resistance effectively improve many risk factor associate metabolic syndrome , success maintain lifestyle change human chronic period poor . Therefore , strategy improve insulin resistance pharmacological mean represent traditional approach clinical medicine . However , widespread use dietary supplement general public , nutritional supplementation use botanical extract effectively increase insulin sensitivity represent attractive novel approach . Unfortunately , considerable controversy exist regard effect botanical supplement metabolic syndrome large part efficacy data many supplement use purpose consists uncontrolled study anecdotal report . As , paucity data human regard effect botanical improve measure insulin action vivo cellular aspect insulin action . However , several line evidence vitro vivo model suggest botanical may modulate intracellular pathway glucose metabolism . Specifically , preclinical data use extract grapes blueberry suggest component botanical mixture , e.g . anthocyanins resveratrol , may play role enhance cellular pathway insulin action . On clinical level , cellular pathway insulin action enhance , e.g . PI-3 kinase activity , associate increase whole body glucose disposal reflect measure assess insulin sensitivity . However , limited experience human study insulin sensitivity assess use `` gold standard '' technique assess vivo insulin action . Therefore , project 's overall objective examine role specific botanical ( i.e. , blueberry powder ) insulin action vivo use hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp . This pilot trial design evaluate fix consumption blueberry powder provide data effect large , comprehensive study plan . To accomplish goal , conduct randomize , placebo-controlled pilot clinical study blueberry powder design assess insulin sensitivity subject obese insulin resistant . We hypothesize blueberry powder effective , compare placebo , increase insulin action vivo . If , pilot trial provide necessary background progress study subject Type 2 diabetes . An increase insulin sensitivity patient Type 2 diabetes expect markedly reduce glucose level .</detailed_description>
