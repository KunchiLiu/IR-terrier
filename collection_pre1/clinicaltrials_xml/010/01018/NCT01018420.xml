	<detailed_description>This study characterize pharmacokinetics colchicine oral dose regimen 4.8 mg 6 hour . In addition , determine whether trend toward effect high dose regimen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , mainly correct QT interval ( QTc ) , via comparison 400 mg dose moxifloxacin , positive control QTc prolongation . Eighteen healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult age 18 55 year age randomize double blind fashion either colchicine moxifloxacin treatment group . On day prior study ( Day -1 ) , subject receive colchicine moxifloxacin placebo accord schedule condition present study , baseline ECG 's determined 24 hour 12-lead Holter monitoring . On Day 1 , minimum 10 hour overnight fast , subject enrol colchicine treatment group ( N=15 ) receive two 0.6 mg capsule ( plus one dose moxifloxacin placebo ) follow additional 0.6 mg colchicine dose ( plus one dose moxifloxacin placebo ) every hour 6 additional dos ; subject moxifloxacin treatment group receive placebo dos match colchicine treatment group first 5 hour , 400 mg moxifloxacin ( plus one dose colchicine placebo ) 6 hour point . Fasting continue 4 hour first dose time standardized meal serve . Blood drawn participant time sufficient adequately define pharmacokinetics colchicine . During study , continuous 24-hour ECG monitoring via 12-lead Holter monitor perform . Triplicate ECG record extract 5 minute observation period throughout 24 hour post dose . Finally , study subject monitor adverse effect throughout entire study period .</detailed_description>
