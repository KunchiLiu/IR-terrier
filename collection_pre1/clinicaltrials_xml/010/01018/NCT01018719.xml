	<brief_title>Evaluation Radiation Induced Toxicity Heart Multi-detector Computed Tomography ( MDCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early detection improve treatment approach follow breast cancer ( BC ) increase disease specific survival result increase cohort BC survivor prone develop late complication treatment , include damage cause radiation therapy ( RT ) heart . Older RT technique treat breast result excess cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Improved RT technique minimize irradiation heart . Data various trial yield conflict result extent contemporary technique actually decrease cardiotoxicity . Long term follow-up large cohort need order evaluate risk cardiotoxicity , base clinical manifestation . The current study aim evaluate various image method potential surrogate assess degree damage cause heart RT BC survivor many year become clinically apparent.This include Multi-detector compute tomography ( MDCT ) - base high resolution compute tomography heart follow injection contrast medium evaluate degree stenosis coronary artery . One hundred patient treat breast carcinoma , fifty leave breast fifty right breast cancer , include current study compare incidence cardiac damage . Since radiation dose heart substantially low patient irradiated right-sided tumor , compare incidence finding indicate cardiac injury two group define contribution RT finding . For patient include study , incidence cardiovascular disease correlate also volume heart irradiate , radiation dose deliver volume , concomitant administration cardiotoxic systemic agent , well patient 's age irradiate risk factor develop coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnose early breast cancer , histologically prove . Both invasive non invasive histology include . 2 . The study include patient , underwent definitive surgery either breast conserve mastectomy receive radiation therapy breast chest wall respectively +/ lymphatic drainage . 3 . No evidence recurrence malignancy malignant disease . 4 . Age diagnosis radiation breast exceed 60 year . 5 . Signed informed consent patient mandatory . 1 . As MDCT require injection contrast medium , Patients contra indication injection contrast medium , due either history allergic reaction renal insufficiency , exclude study .</criteria>
