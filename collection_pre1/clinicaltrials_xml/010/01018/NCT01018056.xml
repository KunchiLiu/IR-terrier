	<brief_title>Developing New Treatments Tourette Syndrome : Therapeutic Trials With Modulators Glutamatergic Neurotransmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Overview : The goal study perform short-term , proof concept study examine safety , tolerability efficacy riluzole D-serine treatment tic . Each medication evaluate compare placebo part randomize , double-blind , flexible dose , parallel , eight-week protocol , contain six week active treatment ( D-serine , riluzole , placebo ) . A total sixty patient ( age 8-17 year ) Tourette syndrome chronic motor tic ( Tourette Syndrome Study Group criterion ) moderate moderately-severe tic participate ; riluzole ( n=24 ) , D-serine ( n=24 ) , placebo ( n=12 ) . This study contain six week active treatment D-serine , riluzole placebo . The decision implement 6-week treatment protocol base follow : ) ability gradual increase dose medication weekly basis first five week dosages beneficial condition ; b ) treatment duration similar use glutamate modulatory treatment study ; c ) time period necessary identify treatment effect milder non-neuroleptic tic-suppressing medication clonidine . We emphasize short term , proof concept study riluzole D-serine treatment tic . Specific question long term durability beneficial effect , potential long-term side-effects , comparison non-drug intervention important , focus pilot study . The study begin screen evaluation ensure subject satisfies eligibility criterion allow subject become familiar assessment procedure . Randomization medication contain look-alike capsule occur baseline visit perform member Research Pharmacy staff . Patients evaluated baseline , direct formal schedule evaluation end treatment week 's 2 , 4 , 6 ( + 2 day ) , telephone evaluation end treatment week 's 1 , 3 , 5 ( + 2 day ) , final visit 8 week . The primary outcome measure effective tic suppression determine difference Total Tic subscale ( TTS ) score Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ) baseline 6 week . Secondary outcome measure include change baseline 6 week score YGTSS total score , Clinical Global Impression -Improvement ( CGI-I ) , Patient Global Impression Improvement ( PGI-I ) . Secondary outcome obsessive-compulsive behavior measure change Children 's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ) . Safety measure include use expand Pittsburgh Side Effect Scale modify include side effect riluzole D-serine , incidence adverse event , measurement vital sign ( BP , pulse ) body weight , physical examination , laboratory study ( comprehensive metabolic panel ( CMP ) , complete blood count ( CBC ) , plasma amino acid , urine analysis ) , DuPaul ADHD Rating Scale , Child Depression Inventory-short version ( CDI-S ) , Multi-Dimensional Anxiety Scale Children ( MASC ) . A Drug Safety Monitoring Board contain three clinician-scientists experience pharmacological trial meet quarterly review study . 1 . Study Population : ) Recruitment : Subjects TS/CMT ( age 8-17 year ) recruit Tourette Syndrome Clinic Johns Hopkins Hospital child psychiatry practice . Patients TS/CMT candidate study : 1 ) tic-suppressing drug naive ; 2 ) currently treatment TS ( medication least three week ) ; 3 ) , judgment Investigators ( Dr Singer Grados ) , adequately manage use current therapy ( prescribe great one month ) willing maintain constant dose throughout protocol . We believe limit study include `` drug-free '' subject would negative impact recruitment . Many individual moderately severe severe tic ( TTS &gt; 22 ) receive medication opinion require prolonged taper extend drug free interval best interest patient . 4 . Procedures : ) Screening visit ( - 3 -1 week ) : Determination diagnostic eligibility criterion : medical history , complete physical examination ( weight , heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate ) ; familiarization assessment procedure , rating scale : tic , Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ) , Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale ( CGI-S ) , obsessive-compulsive problem , Children 's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ) ; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , DuPaul ADHD Rating Scale , depression , Child Depression Inventory- Short Version ( CDI-S ) ; anxiety , Multidimensional Anxiety Scale Children ( MASC ) . Informed consent child assent obtain . Urine ( urine analysis ) blood ( comprehensive metabolic panel , complete blood count , plasma amino acid ) obtain . Females begin menstruate screen blood pregnancy test . Parents tell result test . If patient uncomfortable tell result pregnancy test parent ( ) , may decide take part study . ii ) Baseline Visit ( Day 0 ) : Determination diagnostic eligibility criterion result blood urine analysis study review . Evaluation include weight , heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate , physical examination , rating scale tic , obsessive-compulsive problem , ADHD , depression , anxiety . As part baseline visit , PI Study Coordinator meet parent explain procedure dose titration , review detail outcome measure , review approach administer medication ( e.g. , provide pill water beverage , observe child swallow medication without bite chew ) . Following confirmation study eligibility , Dr Singer forward request medication Johns Hopkins Research Pharmacy . iii ) Randomization ( Day 0 ) : A computer generate unequal randomized scheme use research pharmacist Johns Hopkins Research Pharmacy assign patient riluzole , D-serine , placebo . The pharmacist make treatment assignment prove essential data include patient name study number , age , weight , list concurrent medication . Subjects already medication equally distribute among treatment group . Twenty-four subject randomize riluzole D-serine twelve placebo . Medications , package look-alike capsule , distribute The Johns Hopkins Research Pharmacy . All medication code retain research pharmacist completion study . All study medication double-blind : Investigators , Study Coordinator patient/parent aware treatment assignment . iv ) Treatment group ( week 1 6 ) : All treatment package look-alike capsule . Patients receive 16 day supply medication Baseline visit , 2 4 week visit . Medications administer first week qday basis ( morning ) thereafter twice day schedule ( morning bedtime ) . Each subject contact end week 1 , 3 , 5 telephone evaluate person end end week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . The maximum number capsule per day treatment group five . In order achieve fix number , necessary , Research Pharmacy provide additional vial capsule contain appropriate medication ( see drug description ) . Riluzole ( Rilutek ) : Selection dosage : For reference , adults ALS , riluzole safe effective dosage 100 200 mg twice daily . In treatment study infant spinal muscular atrophy maximum dosage 10 mg high 107 mg/m2 dose , e.g. , 5 kg child whose surface area 0.33 m2 , dose 35 mg/day . No child change laboratory study adverse effect . Selection time dos subject : The start dose riluzole 50 mg one week ; administer one capsule ( 50 ) every morning . Dosage schedule flexible . If need tic suppression , dose increased weekly 50 mg give BID dose . The maximum dose 200 mg/day ( administer 2 capsule BID ) . In individual subject , dose escalation may proceed slowly , dose may reduce necessary . At 4 week visit , additional dosage increase prescribe Dr Singer , pharmacy provide additional vial 14 capsule label study drug , contain placebo ( P ) capsule . No change dosage make final week treatment . D-serine : Selection dosage : In man , D-serine synthesize L-serine via one enzymatic step catalyze enzyme serine racemase . Levels D-serine control activity serine racemase , later high expression forebrain . D-serine currently use IND # 71,369 ( D Javitt , PI ) . This approve serine purchase Research Pharmacy Johns Hopkins encapsulate capsule contain 250 500 mg D-serine . The establish treatment dose aforementioned IND 30 mg/kg/day . In adult schizophrenia OCD , D-serine safe effective dosage 2 gram per day [ Javitt Personal Communication ] . Selection time dos subject : The dosage schedule flexible maximum dose subject 30 mg/kg/day . The following Table provide examples subject different weight receive increase dosage . In individual subject , dose escalation may proceed slowly , dose may reduce necessary . At 4 week visit , additional dosage increase prescribe Dr Singer , pharmacy provide additional vial capsule label study drug , contain either 250 ( A ) 500 ( B ) mg tablet D-serine placebo ( P ) ; capsule content determine patient 's weight ( see ) . No change dosage make final week treatment . Placebo : Placebo tablet formulate look-alike capsule . At 4 week visit , additional dosage increase prescribe Dr Singer , pharmacy provide additional vial 14 capsule label study drug , contain additional placebo ( P ) capsule . Compliance : To assess medication compliance , subject parent ask evaluation point ( telephone visit ) compliance . Subjects require return medication vial visit Dr Singer verify whether number tablet return subject corresponds prescribed intake . Compliance define take &gt; 80 % &lt; 120 % prescribed dos . vi ) Concomitant medication : At patient visit ( baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 week ) patient/parent ask provide name prescribed medication , over-the counter herbal preparation use since last visit . vii ) Medication taper : At completion 6 week treatment phase , medication taper ten day period ; reduction one capsule every day . The half life riluzole 12 hour . viii ) Post-intervention ( end week 8 ) follow-up management By end week 8 , subject completely study medication . Since study medication continue follow completion protocol , visit , part , devote establish ongoing care treatment . All subject offer ongoing care , treatment , follow Dr Singer Johns Hopkins . If subject already treat physician , Dr Singer available provide consultative service . Neither Investigators subject receive information experimental drug assignment entire study complete . ix ) Evaluations : This 8-week study ( 6 week treatment , 2 week taper ) . Telephone evaluation perform Dr Singer end week 's 1,3 , 5 . At telephone contact , clinical response , possible side effect , drug compliance , medication adjustment discuss . Each subject direct evaluation Dr Singer baseline end week 's 2 , 4 , 6.and 8 . These evaluation include pill count ( except baseline ) assure compliance safety measure include physical examination , vital sign ( BP , heart rate ) , weight , blood urine study , assessment side effect use Pittsburgh side effect scale . Dr Grados , blind outcome evaluator , administer score outcome measure subject 's visit ( baseline , end week 2 , 4 , 6 ) . x ) Early stopping rule : Subjects may withdraw study time discretion subject , primary care physician , Dr Singer . 1 . Dr Singer decide subject withdrawn . This decision could make adverse effect , abnormal laboratory value , failure comply study protocol . 2 . The subject his/her personal physician request subject withdrawn . 3 . The subject , reason , require treatment another therapeutic agent could conflict use riluzole D-serine complains unacceptable side-effects . 4 . A Drug Safety Monitoring Board ( SMB ) . The duty SMB provide recommendation PI regard medication issue premature termination study safety reason . The SMB responsible quarterly review data related adverse clinical experience assure safety standard maintain throughout clinical trial . Three clinician-scientists , knowledgeable performance clinical trial , member full time faculty adjacent Kennedy Krieger Institute , influence Johns Hopkins Director Pediatric Neurology , serve Board : Pediatric neurologist Dr 's Gerald Raymond Sakku Naidu Dr Bruce Shapiro , neurodevelopmental pediatrician . The Research Coordinator , assistance Statistician , prepare data quarterly review SMB data store secure computer . The SMB act independently review data . If safety concern relate one group , Board may choose identify actual treatment group access randomization code maintain pharmacy .
