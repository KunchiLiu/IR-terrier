	<brief_title>Dose Finding Study Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray Uncomplicated Acute Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Rationale - Acute rhinosinusitis ( ARS ) condition cause inflammation nose paranasal sinuses generally last 4 week . Despite ARS self-limiting condition , untreated inadequately treated sinus infection lead development complication . Uncomplicated ARS subset ARS distinguish common cold persistence worsen sinus inflammation usual period recovery viral infection nasal cavity ( i.e. , 10 day ) . Clinically difference base follow criterion : symptom present least 10 day less 4 week beyond onset upper respiratory symptom OR symptom worsen 5 day onset . In primary care setting , ARS often treat empirically antibiotic although show provide limited benefit uncomplicated ARS population . Alternatively , use intranasal corticosteroid ( INS ) control symptom uncomplicated ARS plausible base clinically proven ability reduce inflammation mucosal swell . This study phase II study . - Objective - The objective study evaluate safety efficacy two dos FFNS ( 110 mcg daily 110 mcg twice daily ) compare placebo monotherapy treatment adult adolescent subject 12 year age older uncomplicated ARS . - Study Design - This randomize , double-blind , placebo control , parallel group , multi-centre , 2-week treatment study . The study include 2-week post-treatment follow-up period . Approximately 720 subject randomize one three treatment group period 14 day : FFNS 110 mcg QD , FFNS 110 mcg BID , placebo nasal spray .</detailed_description>
