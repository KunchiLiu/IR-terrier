	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis whether antagonist corticotropin release factor type 1 ( CRF1 ) receptor ( i.e . GSK561679 ) superior placebo reduce symptom post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation GSK561679 Women With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) chronic common anxiety disorder follow exposure overwhelm traumatic event . The majority patient PTSD also meet criterion psychiatric disorder PTSD associate increase risk suicide attempt . PTSD responsive psychological pharmacological treatment , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , response rate rarely exceed 60 % , even few patient ( 20-30 % ) achieve clinical remission . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic PTSD . The study divide 4 phase : Phase 1 ( Screening ) : 1 week drug screen period ass study eligibility . Phase 2 ( Pre-Treatment Testing Period ) : Eligible patient enrol 1 week Testing Phase , include neuropsychological neurophysiological test well blood draw electrocardiogram . Phase 3 ( Treatment Period ) : Eligible patient enrol two-armed 6-week period double-blind placebo-controlled acute treatment . All subject continue meet eligibility criterion randomize one two group : GSK561679 ( fix dose 350 mg/day ) placebo . Randomization perform 1:1 ratio two treatment group . Neuropsychological neurophysiological testing repeat 5 week double-blind treatment period . Phase 4 ( Follow-up Period ) : Safety follow-up visit conduct 1 week 1 month end treatment Phase 3 .</detailed_description>
