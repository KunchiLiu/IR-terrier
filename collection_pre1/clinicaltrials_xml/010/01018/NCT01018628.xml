	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Assess Safety Pharmacokinetics SRT2379 Normal Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , single center , clinical study SRT2379 administer orally . Randomized , placebo-controlled , single-blind , multiple-dose , dose-escalation inpatient/outpatient study assess safety pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SRT2379 healthy male volunteer . Approximately sixty-four ( 64 ) subject age 18-55 , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol study . Eight cohort eight subject examine . Subjects within cohort randomize 6:2 receive SRT2379 one seven escalate dos ( A , B , C , D , E , F G ) , likely 25 , 75 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 3000 mg/day placebo . All cohort administer SRT2379 fast state , exception one cohort receive one state dose SRT2379 fed state ( dose SRT2379 administer subject feed state plan 500 mg , however may modify upwards downwards follow evaluation safety pharmacokinetic data earlier cohort . The fed cohort final cohort dose study. ) . Two subject dose Day 1 single dose period one subject receive active treatment one subject receive placebo . The remainder subject within cohort dose Day 2 single dose period five subject receive active treatment one subject receive placebo , assume safety issue arise two subject dose Day 1 . Subjects remain fixed dose test material dosing day study . Each cohort subject dose sequentially approximately three week apart single dose period , return study unit approximately two week single dose administration receive 7 consecutive day dose multiple-dose period . Each cohort subject multiple-dose period dose sequentially , approximately , two week apart ( multiple dose period Day 7 precede cohort multiple dose period Day 1 dose subsequent cohort ) , allow comprehensive safety assessment prior initiation escalate dose subsequent cohort . Subjects sign informed consent form Screening Visit . If eligible willing participate , subject enter study . Subjects fast least 10 hour overnight randomize receive SRT2379 placebo ( test material ) . The subject cohort assign feed dose consume standardize meal receive test material ; subject receive test material fast state . Subjects require stay overnight study unit two night single dose period study subsequently , duration seven-day multiple-dose period ( 8 consecutive overnight stay ) assess safety gather require PK sample . Subjects ask return study center End Study safety assessment approximately 1 week last administration study drug multiple-dose period . Dose escalation dependent safety parameter ( physical examination finding , vital sign , ECG study , adverse event laboratory value ) PK data .</detailed_description>
