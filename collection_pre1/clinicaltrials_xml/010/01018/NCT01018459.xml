	<brief_title>Adenovirus Type 35 Based Circumsporozoite Malaria Vaccine Burkina Faso</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria currently represent one prevalent infection tropical subtropical area throughout world . Each year , malaria affect around 300 million people kill 1 3 million people develop country . Malaria cause mosquito-borne hematoprotozoan parasite belong genus Plasmodium ( P. ) . Malaria parasites life cycle consist several stage . Each one stag able induce specific immune response correspond stage-specific antigen . Malaria parasites transmit man several specie female Anopheles mosquito . Infected mosquito inject sporozoite form malaria parasite mammalian bloodstream . Before invade hepatocytes , sporozoite remain minute circulation . At stage parasite locate extracellular environment expose antibody attack , mainly direct circumsporozoite ( CS ) protein , major component sporozoite surface . Once liver , parasite replicate develop schizonts ( 20,000 per infect cell ) . During intracellular stage parasite , main effector host immune response T lymphocytes , especially CD8+ T cell . Ad35.CS.01 malaria vaccine codon optimize nucleotide sequence represent P. falciparum circumsporozoite ( CS ) surface antigen insert replication deficient Adenovirus 35 backbone . It hypothesize Ad35.CS.01 vaccine prevent P. falciparum parasite , cause malaria , enter develop within liver become infected . Ad35.CS.01 would therefore expect reduce malaria-attributable morbidity mortality . The primary objective ass safety reactogenicity 4 ascending dosage Adenovirus Type 35 circumsporozoite malaria vaccine among healthy , semi-immune , subject give 3 dos 0 , 1 3 month intramuscular ( IM ) injection . The secondary objective evaluate immunogenicity Adenovirus Type 35 base circumsporozoite malaria vaccine performance Humoral Immune Assays ( ELISA [ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ] antibodies circumsporozoite antigen Adenovirus Neutralization Assay neutralize antibody Adenovirus Type 35 ) Cellular Immune Assays ( Elispot Flow Cytometry ) CS-specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell response whole blood ELISA assay measure secrete cytokine . This phase I randomize , control , double-blinded , dosage-escalation trial evaluate immunogenicity , safety , reactogenicity Adenovirus Type 35 base circumsporozoite malaria vaccine Burkinabè , semi-immune , healthy adult 18 45 year age . Researchers propose confirm safety dosage new vaccine assess safety laboratory parameter reactogenicity 14 day initial dose low dosage escalate next dosage level . Each dosage level group include 10 subject give vaccine intramuscularly . Two subject dosage group receive normal saline placebo control .</detailed_description>

Abnormal screen laboratory value . Any abnormal screening value screen test exclude subject study . Abnormal screen labs repeat exception high glucose level repeat fast state . History intravenous ( IV ) drug abuse . History , current medical , occupational , social family problem result alcohol illicit drug use . History moderate severe mental illness , define symptom interfere social occupational function suicidal thoughts/attempts . History receive blood blood product ( blood transfusion , platelet transfusion , immunoglobulin , hyperimmune serum ) previous 6 month . Vaccination live vaccine within past 30 day nonreplicating , inactivate , subunit vaccine within last 14 day . Known hypersensitivity component vaccine . History acute chronic medical condition include , limited , disorder liver , kidney , lung , heart , nervous system , metabolic autoimmune/inflammatory condition . History coagulation defect bleeding ( bruise ) multiple site link trauma surgery . History anaphylaxis severe hypersensitivity reaction . Severe asthma , define emergency room visit hospitalization within last 12 month . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Acute illness , include temperature &gt; 37.8 degree Celsius within one week prior vaccination . Positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Concurrent participation investigational protocol receipt investigational product within previous 30 day plan receipt investigational product within 28 day follow last immunization dose . Identification condition , opinion investigator , would affect ability subject understand comply study protocol would jeopardize safety right subject participate study . History malignancy , include hematologic skin cancer ( except localize basal cell carcinoma ) , know immunodeficiency syndrome . History previous receipt malaria vaccine . Premedication analgesic antipyretic agent 6 hour prior vaccination , plan medication analgesic antipyretic 24 hour follow vaccination . This criterion preclude subject receive medication need arises . Receipt recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine prior study .</criteria>
