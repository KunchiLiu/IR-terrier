	<brief_title>Comparing Follow-Up Schedules Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IB Stage II Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine difference conventional versus experimental follow-up schedule , term patient well-being , express health-related quality life , level anxiety , satisfaction follow-up schedule patient newly diagnose stage IB II cutaneous melanoma . - To determine ability schedule detect recurrence second primary melanoma patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord AJCC stage ( I vs II ) . Patients randomize 1 2 follow-up arm . - Arm I ( experimental follow-up schedule ) : Patients undergo thorough history physical examination periodically 5 year . Patients follow accord experimental schedule : - For stage IB disease : Patients follow annually 5 year . - For stage IIA disease : Patients follow biannually year 1 2 annually year 3 , 4 , 5 . - For stage IIB IIC disease : Patients follow every 4 month year 1 2 , every 6 month year 3 , annually year 4 5 . - Arm II : ( conventional follow-up schedule ) : Patients undergo thorough history physical examination periodically 5 year . Patients follow accord conventional schedule : - For stage disease : Patients follow every 3 month year 1 , every 4 month year 2 , every 6 month year 3-5 . In arm , patient well-being measure 0 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month primary diagnosis , use follow questionnaire : health-related quality life questionnaire ( RAND-36 ) , anxiety questionnaire ( STAI version DY-1 [ state ] DY-2 [ trait ] ) , Cancer Worry Scale , Follow-up Satisfaction questionnaire , self-designed specific question regard self-examination follow-up satisfaction . All patient instruct primary diagnosis receive Melanoma-Patient-Education-Package ( MPEP ) , consist information melanoma ( KWF folder `` melanoma '' ) additional instruction self-examination . Data type recurrence ( locoregional versus distant ) , person detect recurrence , progression recurrence time detection , way recurrence detect ( e.g. , self-examination , accidentally , follow-up physical examination image ) information regard treatment follow-up collect follow-up visit outcome compare group . Outcomes independent questionnaire also compare group .</detailed_description>
