	<brief_title>Pilot Study Using Dietary Intervention Children With Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 19 % school-aged child recurrent abdominal pain ( RAP ) , account 5 % pediatric office visit increase morbidity . The majority child RAP irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) 60 % child go develop IBS adult . IBS account 8 billion dollar year healthcare cost adult within United States . Successful intervention ameliorate symptom childhood IBS may impact adulthood , however current clinical intervention often ineffective . As adult , etiology childhood IBS multi-factorial , food intolerance increase gastrointestinal inflammation potential factor . Another factor , malabsorption fermentable substrate ( e.g. , fructose ) , frequently postulate form food intolerance exacerbate IBS symptom adult child . Studies suggest 61 % child RAP fructose malabsorption . The interaction factor increase gastrointestinal inflammation malabsorption fermentable substrate relate individual patient currently unknown . Recently , diet lower intake combination food find effective adult IBS identify fructose malabsorption . This diet use child IBS mechanism ( ) efficacy explore . This pilot project focus use restrict fermentable substrate diet treatment child IBS , evaluate decrease bacterial fermentation gas production decrease gastrointestinal inflammation mechanism effect . Using prospective , open label design child meet Rome III childhood IBS criterion , Specific Aims : 1 ) Characterize effectiveness restrict FODMAPs diet improving symptom ( number abdominal pain episode ; primary endpoint ) ; 2 ) To determine mechanism restrict FODMAPs diet may work . We Hypothesize : 1 ) A restrict FODMAPs diet improve abdominal pain symptom associate childhood IBS identify fructose malabsorption ; 2 ) A restrict FODMAPs diet improve symptom part decrease bacterial fermentation gas production amongst potential mechanism . The result proposal may , apply large scale , aid large number child IBS potentially provide insight mechanism ( ) behind successful dietary intervention childhood IBS .</detailed_description>
