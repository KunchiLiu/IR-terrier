	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evaluating Response RadiationTherapy Patients With High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed DescriptionOBJECTIVES : I . To develop multimodality statistical model act surrogate marker scheme early change high grade glioma patient undergo radiation therapy , use conventional MRI , MR diffusion tensor imaging , perfusion , permeability , spectroscopic image incorporate radiation dose calculation deliver locally result clinical questionnaire model . II . To assess treatment response tumor normal tissue change . OUTLINE : Patients undergo multimodality MRI image baseline , week 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 4-6 week completion radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
