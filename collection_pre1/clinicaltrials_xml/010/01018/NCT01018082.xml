	<brief_summary>The overall goal 2-year pilot project utilize interdisciplinary strategy determine prevalence type neurodevelopmental impairment PHACE syndrome , rare vascular syndrome , rapidly translate discovery clinical care guideline identify risk infant early intervention initiate . Infantile hemangioma common benign tumor infancy , incidence estimate 4-5 % . A subgroup patient infantile hemangiomas exhibit additional associate structural anomaly brain , cerebral vasculature , eye , aorta , heart , chest wall rare neurocutaneous disorder call PHACE syndrome ( OMIM 606519 ) . PHACE refers Posterior fossa anomaly , Hemangioma , Arterial lesion , Cardiac abnormalities/aortic coarctation , abnormality Eye . Affected child multi-organ involvement , increase number cerebral , cerebellar , cerebrovascular anomaly describe ; however , significance neuroradiologic finding know . As investigator ' neonate hemangiomas grow young child , neurodevelopmental impairment become evident , even among patient without MRI evidence stroke structural brain anomaly . Some infant develop progressive cerebral arterial disease lead moyamoya-like vasculopathy ischemic stroke . An interdisciplinary research project study brain cerebral vascular imaging concert neurological , psychological , behavioral , neurodevelopmental , quality life outcome measure never conduct . Diagnostic management guideline also lack . The investigator ' long-term goal develop medical and/or surgical therapeutic intervention improve overall health child PHACE syndrome . This novel project constitute first study devastate feature PHACE syndrome : neurodevelopmental sequela .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 ) Establish cohort 30 well-characterized patient PHACE syndrome enhance exist tissue DNA bank facilitate future investigation . We use rigorous phenotyping strategy establish cohort 30 patient PHACE syndrome 4-6 year age , collect neuroimaging study patient tissue DNA sample enhance exist tissue repository facilitate future study , validation biomarkers . Aim 2 ) Determine prevalence describe spectrum neurodevelopmental impairment cohort patient 4-6 year age PHACE syndrome . Given multiple risk factor neurodevelopmental deficit PHACE patient , propose comprehensive assessment cohort patient 4-6 year age , age range represent critical period , time child enter formal educational system allow thorough evaluation neurodevelopmental skill . Upon completion 2-year study expect immediate impact clinical care identify specific deficit cohort . Once identify quantify , publish data clinical guideline patient management include age frequency neuroimaging , frequency neurologic evaluation , age utility neurodevelopmental assessment . We anticipate guideline identify risk infant early intervention initiate , result improve functional outcome . In addition , data provide cost-effective functional outcome methodology use clinical trial validate biomarkers identify pilot study . Aim 3 ) Identify potential clinical , molecular , biochemical , image biomarkers aim early detection risk stratification cerebrovasculopathy neurodevelopmental impairment . We hypothesize certain risk factor include , limited , genotype , hemangioma size , hemangioma location , cerebral anomaly , cerebellar anomaly , cerebrovascular anomaly predispose patient progressive vasculopathy . We determine risk factor identify biomarkers progressive cerebrovascular disease . Based information establish guideline serial diagnostic cerebrovascular image develop method risk-stratification allow early clinical prediction intervention long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis .
