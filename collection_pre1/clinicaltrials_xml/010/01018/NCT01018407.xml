	<detailed_description>While significant progress make toward identify effective intervention preschool-age child autism ( National Research Council , 2001 ) , scientifically rigorous study compare active ingredient intervention examine outcome focus core deficit . To address area need , collaborative , multi-site project combine expertise investigator experience randomize controlled clinical trial ( RCTs ) , study core deficit young child autism , data management analysis multi-site clinical trial . The goal project compare efficacy two intervention improve spoken language reduce symptom autism : ( 1 ) Discrete trial training ( DTT ) -- apply behavior analysis approach emphasize highly structure teach school readiness skill ( match-to-sample , imitation , functional play , receptive expressive language ) ( 2 ) Interpersonal developmental approach ( IDA ) : visually support , child-focused , flexible engagement , social communicative engagement approach joint attention , symbolic play , use conventional symbol within socially valid communicative context . Children randomly assign DTT IDA . In condition , child 's ongoing early intervention program augment two 30-minute session daily study intervention ( DTT IDA ) conduct supervised therapist 4 month , transition home therapy 2 month . Potential moderator ( e.g. , initial mental age language age ) mediator ( e.g . parent synchronization joint attention change parental expectancy ) treatment outcome also examine . The assessment measure include diagnostic developmental measure . There three set assessment . The first set assessment determine whether child eligible study . If child eligible , complete next set assessment , complete three point : ( 1 ) prior entry treatment ( baseline measurement conduct start treatment phase ) ; ( 2 ) exit ; ( 3 ) 6 month follow-up . Several assessment also complete 2 month , 4 month , 6 month .</detailed_description>
