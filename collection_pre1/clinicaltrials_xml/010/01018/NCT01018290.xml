	<brief_summary>Maximizing surgical removal brain tumor minimize neurologic deficit challenge . Functional brain tissue may reside close even within abnormality , inadvertent removal disturbance area result neurologic deficit . At present , gold standard identify critical motor area tumor surgery intraoperative invasive direct current stimulation ( DCS ) handpiece . More recently , new non-invasive preoperative method brain mapping , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , may use identify eloquent motor area . fMRI signal use localization motor area generate brain activated performance specific motor task . However , fMRI signal also generate sensory input , result fMRI map may include sensory well motor area . Nexstim develop Navigated Brain Stimulation ( NBS ) system use TMS software base Navigational System together may specific spatial accuracy . This study aim determine whether navigated TMS able identify eloquent motor cortical area patient brain tumor determine clinical accuracy procedure compare result obtain intraoperative DCS fMRI .</brief_summary>
