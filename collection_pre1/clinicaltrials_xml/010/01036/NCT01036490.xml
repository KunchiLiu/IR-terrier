	<brief_title>Exercise Obese Diabetic Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes , obesity , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) generally physically inactive , high mortality rate , may benefit exercise program . However , randomize control trial determine benefit exercise train population . This study seek substantiate hypothesis increase energy expenditure exercise training obese diabetic patient CKD result follow benefit : 1 . Renal benefit , include reduction proteinuria stabilization glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 2 . Cardiovascular benefit , include decrease blood pressure , decreased heart rate , increase exercise tolerance . 3 . Improved glucose control ( low glycated hemoglobin ) , lipid control ( decrease cholesterol improve atherogenic profile ) 4 . Improved body composition ( weight loss , increased lean body mass decrease fat mass ) . 5 . Decreased inflammation ( assessed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ) , endothelial dysfunction ( assessed flow-mediated dilatation ) , oxidative stress ( assess reduce glutathione ) . 6 . Increased health-related quality life . In preparation proposal , investigator perform 24-week randomized control feasibility study compare aerobic exercise plus optimal medical management medical management alone patient type 2 diabetes , obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) , stage 2-4 CKD ( eGFR 15-90 mL/min/1.73m2 ) persistent proteinuria &gt; 200 mg/g . Subjects randomize exercise underwent thrice weekly aerobic train 6 follow 18 week supervise home exercise . The primary outcome variable change proteinuria . Exercise training result significant improvement exercise duration stress test persist 24 week . This accompanied significant decrease rest systolic blood pressure 24-hour proteinuria 24 week . No change see control group . The investigator conclude exercise training obese diabetic patient CKD feasible result demonstrable train effect ( increase exercise duration decrease rest blood pressure ) . Moreover , may decrease proteinuria thus renoprotective effect . The investigator propose larger-scale randomized control trial determine effect exercise renal function , cardiovascular fitness , inflammation , oxidative stress diabetic patient CKD . This 52-week randomized study base investigator ' pilot study design modification . As opposed 6-week training period 18-week home exercise period utilize pilot study , subject randomize exercise undergo 12 week intensive exercise training exercise laboratory follow 40 week supervise home exercise training ( total duration study 1 year ) . Moreover , due recent recommendation resistance train incorporate exercise training regimens type 2 diabetic patient , investigator incorporate resistance ( strength ) training proposal . The primary outcome variable change proteinuria 12 52 week . Secondary outcome variable change albuminuria estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 12 52 week . In addition , investigator measure blood pressure ( BP ) , glycated hemoglobin , lipid profile , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level , body weight composition , endothelial dysfunction ( flow-mediated dilatation ) , Quality Life ( QoL ) evaluation . The Index Coexistent Diseases ( ICED ) measure comorbidities determine comorbid condition influence outcomes study . The Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) also use determine influence depression ( covariate ) study outcome adherence study objective . This study directly address effect structure exercise program patient population high risk cardiovascular complication . The investigator specifically address novel idea exercise improve cardiovascular fitness also ameliorate renal complication result diabetes .</detailed_description>
