	<brief_summary>Background : - Eye tracking , ability focus follow move target eye , often difficult people schizophrenia . Research show first-degree relative people schizophrenia , parent sibling , also tend difficulty smooth eye movement eye track . Researchers interested use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study brain activity eye track test order well understand effect schizophrenia brain function . Objectives : - To study eye-tracking eye-tracking impairment people without schizophrenia . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 62 year age one three group : ( 1 ) patient diagnose schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder , ( 2 ) first-degree relative patient group 1 , ( 3 ) healthy volunteer family history psychosis . Design : - The study involve two visit , one screening session one testing session . Each session take 3 hour . - Participants ask avoid consume alcohol restrict consumption caffeine start study . Participants provide urine breath sample test chemical may interfere study . - Participants visit clinical center morning day scan session provide blood urine sample require . Participants return admit overnight stay later afternoon evening . - During screen session , participant provide medical psychological history , provide blood sample , learn eye movement task scan session . - During scan session , participant fMRI scan . During scan , perform eye movement task involve follow move light target screen , also perform task test ability think pay attention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The propose protocol aim combine functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) SPEM eyetracking measure study 1 ) neural circuit control psychophysical , cognitive , oculomotor aspect eyetracking ; 2 ) underlie neural mechanism schizophrenia-related eyetracking impairment ; 3 ) degree pursuit-related imaging change aggregate family . The human eye movement system complex . It likely component system , rather whole system , involve pathology schizophrenia . Study Population : Three group subject test : schizophrenic patient ( approximately n=60 ) , full sibling patient ( approximately n=60 ) , healthy control without family history psychosis ( approximately n=60 ) . To reach goal 60 per group expect enroll 225 subject . Design : Experiments protocol employ fMRI combination psychophysical oculomotor paradigm dissect neural correlate neurophysiological component control pursuit eye movement . A high-resolution in-magnet eyetracking system use imaging . Using image technology able associate behavioral performance specific brain region . Outcome Measures : Combining fMRI visual neuroscience technique , protocol study functional neuroanatomic underpinnings smooth pursuit eye movement ( SPEM ) deficits schizophrenia . We aim establish pathophysiological model illness base SPEM paradigm . Such disease model may provide safe vivo examination effect pharmacological intervention , comorbidity , functionality relate schizophrenia . For example , patient schizophrenia high comorbidity nicotine use . High incidence substance abuse schizophrenia suggest two condition may share common pathophysiology . Excessive nicotine use schizophrenia increasingly view form self-medication patient correct underlie pathophysiological change cause illness . We find nicotine transiently improve smooth pursuit eye movement deficit patient . We currently examine nicotinic effect learn component smooth pursuit eye movement schizophrenic patient use fMRI . This example carefully validate behavioral/imaging paradigm use pathophysiological model aid study complex brain illness include schizophrenia substance abuse . Clearly , research direction also require parallel research effort aim in-depth understanding foundational neural mechanism smooth pursuit eye movement .</detailed_description>

Examples condition include , limited , stroke , seizure , HIV/AIDS , uncontrolled high blood pressure , history significant head trauma , CNS infection tumor base medical history , peripheral vascular disease , coagulopathies , history superficial deep vein thrombosis . 5 . Individuals partake significant alcohol drug use , nicotine dependence . Significant drug use define history alcohol substance dependence past 6 month current substance abuse , follow exception . Subjects may users alcohol and/or marijuana may meet criterion dependence . 6 . Individuals significant ophthalmological and/or neurological condition severe vision impairment follow move dot 60 cm front exclude . Participants reduce vision include long follow move dot 60 cm front . Healthy control : 1 . Individuals psychiatric illness . The SCID Structured Interview DSMIV Personality Diagnoses ( SIDP ) use exclude volunteer Axis I II disorder . 2 . Individuals family history psychotic illness accord Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria ( FHRDC ) . First Degree Relatives patient : 1 . First degree relative DSMIV Axis I diagnosis psychosis , exception relative past history psychosis include symptoms present , he/she take antipsychotic drug . 2 . First degree relative meet SIDP criterion Axis II disorder exception make relative meet criterion schizophrenia spectrum personality disorder ( SSPD ) .</criteria>
