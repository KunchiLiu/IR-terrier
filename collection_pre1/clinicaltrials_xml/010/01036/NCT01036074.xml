	<brief_summary>Background : - Cocaine affect brain 's ability process information . However , different people respond cocaine different way , difference brain structure function may affect cocaine alters brain activity . By use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) monitor brain activity task provide simple reward , researcher hope good understand brain respond reward response affect drug like cocaine . Objectives : - To determine effect cocaine administration reward experience cocaine-dependent individual . - To study genetic personality factor may contribute cocaine dependence . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 45 year age either cocaine-dependent seek treatment healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants ask avoid consume alcohol restrict consumption caffeine prior study . Participants provide urine breath sample test chemical may interfere study . - All participant complete train session least one fMRI scan session . During train session , participant introduce reward task MRI equipment . - Healthy volunteer single fMRI session involve reward task complete scan . Rewards include small amount fruit juice opportunity win money . - Cocaine-dependent participant train session three experimental session include 1 ) mock MRI scan test cocaine tolerance , 2 ) one fMRI scan reward task administration IV cocaine , 3 ) one fMRI scan reward task administration IV placebo ( saline solution ) . Rewards include small amount fruit juice opportunity win money . - In addition scan , participant provide blood sample study answer questionnaire provide researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The overall objective study determine effect cocaine administration upon experience reward dependent individual contribution reward processing ( dysfunction ) reinforce effect cocaine recidivism rate note cocaine-dependent individual . The primary goal employ functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ascertain function neural system respond cocaine human participant determine role play process different type reward stimulus episode individual drug-free acute influence cocaine . Study Population : The experimental population investigation non-treatment seek , cocaine-dependent adult ( i.e . 18 45 year old ) . A cohort healthy , drug-free , individual , match age , gender , ethnicity IQ , serve control group . Design : This experiment employ mixed-measures , counter-balanced design . Participants complete two measure reward processing ( i.e . revise monetary incentive delay ( MID ) task temporal difference error task ( TDE/juice ) task ) undergo BOLD EPI fMRI . The scanning procedure repeat subject , participant undertakes 2 session . Cocaine-dependent individual receive either two injection cocaine ( 30 mg/70 kg body weight ; intravenous ( IV ) administration ) two injection saline scan . Within session , IV injection give approximately 10 minute prior start one reward measure . The order cocaine saline scan randomize participant blind experimental condition prior participation . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure neural substrate reward process differ cocaine-dependent individual control , impact acute cocaine administration upon brain function associate reward function .</detailed_description>
