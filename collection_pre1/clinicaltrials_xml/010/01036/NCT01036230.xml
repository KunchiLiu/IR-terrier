	<brief_summary>Background : - Environmental cue frequently induce expectancy individual may strongly influence actual experience associate cue . This positive negative consequence behavior decision making . For instance , addict individual experience cue associate imminent drug taking , expectancy come experience also form likely effect subsequent experience drug . - Researchers interested study brain responds kinds environmental cue expectancy order learn addiction crave substance-abusing individual . Objectives : - To compare response reward ( drug-related non-drug-related ) cocaine user non-using individual . - To study effect expectation reward-related ( drug-induced non-drug-induced ) responses brain activity cocaine user non-using individual . Eligibility : -Individuals 18 45 year age regular cocaine user otherwise healthy , healthy individual cocaine user . Design : - This study involve two experiment . Participants assign one experiment . - Participants must use drug least 3 day visit , may consume alcohol 24 hour visit , may consume caffeinated beverage 12 hour visit . On day visit , participant provide urine breath sample test drug/alcohol use . - Experiment 1 : In MRI scanner , participant respond question image screen , receive small amount flavor liquid ( chocolate cherry ) tube mouth . - Experiment 2 : In MRI scanner , participant respond question image screen , receive injection liquid ( saline solution drug provide high similar cocaine ) intravenous line . Participants experiment return follow-up visit provide urine sample study . - The specific assignment ( Experiment 1 Experiment 2 experiment ) determine number study day follow-up visit require .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Environmental cue frequently induce expectancy course normal daily life . When individual smell see coffee tasting , expectancy come experience form influence actual experience consume coffee . Similarly , addict individual experience cue associate imminent drug taking , expectancy come experience also form . This protocol examine neural response cue predictive stimulus ( neutral rewarding ) subsequent receipt predict stimulus . Study Population : Study participant include 18-50 year old , male non-pregnant female otherwise healthy cocaine dependent individual control individual history stimulant use history abuse dependence drug nicotine . Design : The study employ fMRI elucidate neural underpinnings reward processing . The reward stimulus study taste stimulus ( small squirt juice chocolate ) drug stimulus ( intravenous methylphenidate ( IV MPH ) ) . For taste stimulus , cue vary sensory modality ( visual vs. olfactory ) novelty ( well-known vs. novel ) . Novel well-known cue stimulus include experimental day development expectancy study cue-taste pairing learn compare well-known cue-taste pairing . The MPH/saline injection receive write cue . Outcome Measures : BOLD fMRI signal reward stimulus compare various cue condition .</detailed_description>
