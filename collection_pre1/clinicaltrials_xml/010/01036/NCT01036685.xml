	<brief_summary>Background : - Drugs abuse effect mood , behavior , thinking , decision making may encourage people continue use make difficult stop . Researchers study effect interested develop new test evaluate drug drug use affect different area brain . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan allow researcher study brain activity change brain function . When specific psychological test perform functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan , researcher examine effect drug use brain . By develop test new procedure fMRI study , information obtain brain function activity drug-using non-drug-using individual , information help develop new treatment therapy substance abuse . Objectives : - To evaluate effect newly develop psychological procedure perform fMRI scan . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 13 55 year age willing undergo MRI scanning . - Both drug-using non-drug-using individual select study . Design : - Before start study , participant complete questionnaire medical psychological history , provide information past current drug use . Researchers introduce task perform scan session ( ) , allow participant practice test either separate computer computer use MRI scan . - During study , participant ask one task select researcher . The task perform computer MRI machine , may involve receive reward ( money sip juice ) action , memory reaction-time test , test involve respond instruction screen . - Participants receive compensation participation study , include hourly compensation individual visit lump-sum compensation MRI scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Drugs abuse cognitive affective effect may contribute inception maintenance use . In order measure effect , psychological test suitable use outside fMRI scanner need develop validated . Thus , objective protocol allow development , assessment refinement cognitive affective task determination practical feasibility efficacy MRI non-MRI application . The design pilot psychological test fMRI task specifically design adolescent population allow investigator determine tests/tasks measure theorize cognitive construct result measurable interpretable fMRI data adolescent . Study Population : This minimal-risk protocol employ volunteer participant age 18-55 , must generally healthy male non-pregnant female . In order ensure applicability relevant group , drug non-drug use volunteer well recruit clinical population use validate task design parameter . Specially designated task may pilot prisoner population . Design : Participants may pilot task outside and/or inside MRI scanner , depend aspect task development require verification . Tasks develop de novo undergo step . Modifications previously publish MRI task may require one step . Upon successful verification , specific experimental manipulation perform separate , hypothesis driven protocol . Outcome measure : Our goal determine task develop reliably appropriately measure specific cognitive construct behavior think associate specific brain system , also yield measurable interpretable fMRI result .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Male female age 1855 . 2 . All subject must able provide inform consent/assent . Additional criterion specific population : 1 . 379smoker daily smoker tobacco cigarettes least one year ( exclude quit attempt ) 2 . 379user DSMV substance use disorder substance nicotine . 3 . 379otherpsychdiagnosis DSMV disorder , stable treatment ( i.e. , medication change previous four week clearly identify treat psychiatrist ) . 3 . Additional criterion MRI phase participant : Righthanded . Assessment tool : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . Rationale : Lefthanded individual may lateralization many brain function differ righthanded individual majority population . Therefore , inclusion lefthanded individual may add unwanted noise image data . C ) Exclusion Criteria Bench Only Phase ( Does require MRI . Task require gather accurate behavioral data ) . 1 . History neurological illness include limited CVA , CNS tumor , head trauma , MS demyelinate disease , epilepsy , movement disorder , migraine treatment . Assessment tool : phone screen history physical ( H &amp; P ) . Rationale : Neurological illness likely impair performance range task pilot protocol may impair ability tolerate procedure . 2 . Current use psychoactive medication unless require psychiatric disorder participant 379user 379otherpsychdiagnosis subcategories treat . Assessment tool : phone screen , H &amp; P , Triage , comprehensive urine toxicology . Rationale : psychoactive medication likely alter performace range task pilot protocol . 3 . Cognitive impairment . Assessment tool : self report extend placement special education class learn problem , history specific learn disability mental retardation . Rationale : Cognitive impairment likely impair performance range task pilot protocol may impair ability tolerate procedure . 4 . Current major mood , anxiety psychotic disorder ( unless task evaluate specific clinical population ) . Assessment tool : self report , H &amp; P . Rationale : Current major mood psychotic disorder likely impair performance range task pilot protocol may impair ability tolerate procedure . Additional criterion MRI Phase : 5 . Pregnancy . Assessment tool : Urine pregnancy test . Rationale : Since hormonal change pregnancy show impact cognitive functioning task develop may yield subtle difference control drug abuse subject , need minimize extraneous variation pilot data . Additionally , fMRI accept safe procedure purely research purpose pregnancy . 6 . Deep vein thrombosis : Assessment tool : self report H &amp; P thrombosis , medical condition may lead hypercoagulable state Rationale : Lying still &gt; 2 hour may risk development DVT person certain medical condition . As , person exclude . 7 . HIV positive individual . Assessment tool : oral HIV test serum confirmation positive result . Rationale : potential cognitive and/or CNS disease make perform cognitive task nonreliable /or non generalizeable general population . Also , potential liver/metabolic/vascular disease interfere physiological transduction mechanism fMRI ( i.e . make measurement unreliable ) . 8 . Unable undergo MRI scan due possible pregnancy , metallic device body , claustrophobia body morphometry . 9 . Currently use respiratory , cardiovascular anticonvulsant medication may interfere BOLD MRI signal .</criteria>
