	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) important cause morbidity mortality patient undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . The symptom chronic GVHD similar autoimmune disease , treatment pain often involve steroid use cause severe side effect long term . - At present , research instrument measure symptom child chronic GVHD . Treatment practitioner may use one several pediatric quality life questionnaire , none specific chronic GVHD instrument potential gap ability assess full spectrum problem experience child chronic GVHD . Researchers interested develop well understanding disease burden experience child adolescent chronic GVHD . Objectives : - To develop Pediatric Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale ( PCSS ) reliably measure disease-specific burden chronic GVHD child . Eligibility : - Children adolescents 5 18 year age undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant diagnose chronic GVHD require treatment . Design : - There two phase study ; participant enroll phase I ( question generation ) time . - Researchers interview participant ask open-ended question ( require one- two-word response ) symptoms adults chronic GVHD find problematic . - Both parent child participate interview , audio-recorded . Depending child adolescent age , interview may conduct together parent separately . - No treatment give part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Validation Symptom Scale Children With Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Currently , large number child chronic GVHD deal many year disfigure painful chronic illness side effect long term steroid use . - The broad category limit extensive chronic GVHD recognize clinician , particularly useful clinical practice . Chronic GVHD may involve almost every organ although commonly affect skin , eye , mouth , liver , intestine , lung musculoskeletal system . - Recently , large effort NIH Consensus chronic GVHD standardize response criterion patient chronic GVHD , clinical trial . Because absence evidence suggest response criterion truly correlate improvement , NIH Consensus Panel recommend follow physical sign chronic GVHD , also symptoms GVHD . Primary Objective : - Develop Pediatric Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale ( PCSS ) reliably measure disease specific burden chronic GVHD child . Secondary Objectives : - Correlate high low score PCSS standard quality life measure . - Determine use Rasch measurement model whether PCSS sufficient sensitivity change scale useful clinical intervention trial . Eligibility : - Children 5 18 year age , undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant - Clinical diagnosis chronic GVHD need systemic treatment - No evidence primary disease relapse - Must willing sign inform consent , applicable , child assent Design : - With final goal develop scale similar design Lee Scale measure symptom burden specifically child chronic GVHD , study conduct two phase : item generation psychometric validation . - In phase I , local team institution interview participant use script identify symptom concern pediatric chronic GVHD patient . Based interview , decide whether test different scale different age group , single scale . - Data Phase II use finalize validate pediatric symptom scale , assessment test-retest characteristic , use item reduction , examination construct validity , internal consistency , convergent divergent validity , evaluation sensitivity change .</detailed_description>
