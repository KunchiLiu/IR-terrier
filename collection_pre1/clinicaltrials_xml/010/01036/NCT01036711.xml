	<brief_summary>Background : - Many cigarette smoker claim smoke improves ability think concentrate , report problem think concentration quit smoking . Some research indicate nicotine enhance certain aspect attention memory human . However , research need determine nicotine affect different element brain ability think , pay attention , respond reward , make decision . Researchers interested use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study effect nicotine brain function activity . Objectives : - To determine effect nicotine attentional thinking process , include reward-seeking behavior . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age either current smoker ( 10 cigarette per day least 1 year ) nonsmoker . Design : - The study four experiment . Each experiment require two MRI scan session train session . Participant one experiment . - Participants receive train type computerized test give active portion study . Participants also fill questionnaire nicotine use alcohol drug use , provide breath urine sample . - During test session , participant fMRI scan perform four different set task test attention , memory , concentration , reward-seeking behavior , decision making . Smokers wear nicotine patch placebo patch test session , tell patch receiving . The order session different individual participant . - Participants provide blood urine sample throughout research study evaluation purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Experiments protocol employ fMRI address interaction nicotine cognitive process work memory , attention , executive function inhibitory control , conceptual reason attention switching , addition reward temporal error reward processing . The effect nicotine cognitive process also assess outside MRI scanner . Assessments genetic variant do hypothesis account inter-individual difference brain imaging data . Study Population : The study population consist adult ( 18-50 y.o . ) non-treatment seek smoker age gender match non-smoking control subject . The control subject provide normative data cognitive task performance correspond neural activation , well provide control time effect ( e.g . practice effect repeat cognitive task performance ) . Smokers smoke least 10 cigarette per day period 1 year . Both smoker control suitable fMRI scan . Subjects may dependent drug except nicotine caffeine . Design : In within subject design , experienced smoker perform cognitive task involve memory encode consolidation , selective/divided sustained attention , well reward temporal error reward process two hour follow single blind application nicotine patch ( 21 mg/24 hr ) separate session different day , follow application placebo patch . The task perform fMRI scanning . Not task do time , rather , group task run series task set : Task set A : Selective/divided attention task Intention/ attention task ; Task set B : The SARAT ( Spatial Attentional Resource Allocation task ) design enable dissociation top-down stimulus driven process visuospatial selective attention well CEFER task measure central executive function task isolate allocation attentional resource within work memory ; Task set C : Monetary Incentive Delay Temporal Delay Error processing task ; Task set D : Affective Forecasting Loss Aversion task . Control subject task scan without patch . Blood drawn participant analysis genetic variant smoker , plasma nicotine cotinine measure . Outcome : We determine acute effect nicotine attentional cognitive mechanism emotional process anticipation receipt reward affect neuronal activation property acute nicotine administration experience smoker . In addition , determine whether genetic polymorphism predict BOLD response cognitive task pertinent nicotine addiction . Plasma nicotine cotinine include factor analysis nicotine-induced effect fMRI signal take account potentially large inter-individual variability circulate nicotine concentration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects must age 1850 . 2 . Subject must good health base history physical exam . 3 . Subjects must righthanded . 4 . Smoking subject must demonstrate experienced user base upon urine cotinine level least 100ng/ml , must smoke minimum 10 cigarettes/day duration use least 1 year . 5 . Subjects may users alcohol and/or marijuana may meet criterion dependence either substance . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Are pregnant breast feeding . Urine pregnancy test perform female volunteer childbearing potential experimental session . 2 . Have implant metallic device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part ) claustrophobia render unable undergo fMRI scan . 3 . Have major medical illness include , limited , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , asthma , diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , coagulopathies , syncope , history superficial deep vein thrombosis , HIV , clinically significant infectious disease . 4 . Have current major psychiatric disorder include , limited , mood , anxiety , psychotic disorder , substanceinduced psychiatric disorder . 5 . Have neurological illness include , limited , seizure disorder , migraine , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history head trauma , CVA , CNS tumor . 6 . Have significant alcohol drug use , nicotine dependence . 7 . Have gros structural abnormality onT1 weighted image . 8 . Have cognitive impairment assess screen WASI vocabulary subtest 48 , correspond full IQ 85 ( case screening , full WASI do verify IQ 85 ) . Justification : Cognitive impairment learn disability associate alteration brain region use accomplish task , , therefore , may introduce significant variably data . 9 . Are engage actively seek smoke cessation treatment .</criteria>
