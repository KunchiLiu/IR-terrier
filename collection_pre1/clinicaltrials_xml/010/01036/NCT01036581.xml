	<brief_summary>Background : - Functional structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques allow researcher map study brain work rest engage specific task . MRI scan provide information drug affect brain , drug addiction change brain influence behavior , mood , think process . To good understand underlying mechanism drug addiction develop strategy effective treatment , researcher interest develop new MRI technique study effect addiction brain . Objectives : - To develop new functional structural MRI technique , evaluate potential use brain image study relate addiction . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age . - Participants may smokers nonsmoker , may use drug use drug . Design : - During initial screening , participant complete questionnaire family personal history , drug use , information require researcher . Participants ask complete task MRI scan show perform task scan session . - Before study session , participant may ask complete following : question drug use last week , breathalyzer test , urine drug-use assessment , urine pregnancy test , measure carbon monoxide . Participants also provide blood sample start scan . - For scan session , participant MRI scan last approximately 2 hour . - MRI scan may include injection contrast agent study brain function , specific task perform scan , experiment study brain 's response carbon dioxide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Functional structural magnetic resonance image technique prove essential noninvasive mapping brain physiology pathology . The primary objective protocol develop advanced magnetic resonance image spectroscopy ( MRI MRS ) techniques neuroimaging study relate addiction . These neuroimaging technique use study well understand underlie mechanism drug addiction potentially develop strategy effective treatment . Study population : Healthy control drug user participate study . Technical development MRI/MRS perform healthy control , evaluation applicability technique addiction relate neuroimaging study perform use drug user healthy control . Design : Based fundamental principle biophysical transduction physiological signal magnetic resonance ( MR ) image spectroscopic signal , advance technique develop measure activity , metabolism , structure , biochemistry brain . The development technique typically include following step : 1 ) proof-of-concept computer simulation , 2 ) implementation image concept MRI scanner phantom , 3 ) feasibility test control subject , 4 ) evaluation sensitivity specificity technique detect functional and/or structural alteration brain relate specific disease . Outcome measure : Advanced neuroimaging technique develop protocol demonstrate ability distinguish drug use control population . Successful technique incorporate hypothesis drive study Neuroimaging Research Branch NIDA-IRP . These technique also useful , publication technology transfer , entire neuroimaging society .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must age 1855 , generally healthy male nonpregnant female . Smokers , nonsmoker , drug use nondrug use population participate study . INCLUSION CRITERIA : General : Male nonpregnant female adult age 1855 . All subject must able provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude : Are pregnant . Urine pregnancy test perform female volunteer childbearing potential experimental session . Are unable undergo MRI scan due implant metallic device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part include Copper 7 IUD ) claustrophobia . Have major medical illness include , limited , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , asthma , diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , coagulopathies , syncope , history superficial deep vein thrombosis , HIV , clinically significant infectious disease may alter signal measure . Have current major psychiatric disorder include , limited , mood , anxiety , psychotic disorder . Have neurological illness include , limited , seizure disorder , migraine , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history head trauma , CVA , CNS tumor . Have cognitive impairment assess screen WASI vocabulary subtest 48 , correspond full IQ 85 ( case screening , full WASI do verify IQ 85 ) . Justification : Cognitive impairment learn disability associate alteration brain region use accomplish task , , therefore , may introduce significant variably data . Inability comply task demand . Additional exclusion experiment : Based scientific medical requirement particular experiment , participant may also exclude : lefthandedness ( use cognitive affective task ) , colorblindness ( use task require color discrimination ) , drug use diagnosis ( technique validate nondrug use population ) , renal insufficiency ( contrast agent use ) , determine estimate glomerular filtration rate , must &gt; 60 ml/min , renal insufficiency greatly increase risk nephrogenic systemic fibrosis gadolinium exposure . Renal insufficiency may also associate metabolic abnormality may interfere MR image . Lactation ( contrast agent use ) . The safety gadolinium nursing infant establish .</criteria>
