	<brief_summary>The EVIDENCE trial randomize control trial compare therapeutic effectiveness cost-effectiveness Precision® Spinal Cord Stimulation reoperation treatment pain patient Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) . FBSS define persistent recurrent pain follow one lumbosacral spine surgical procedure . Surgical procedure result FBSS categorize either decompression decompression follow fusion without instrumentation . The pain FBSS categorize neuropathic , involve pathological nerve activity commonly characterize patient shoot burn and/or nociceptive , signal actual impend tissue damage inflammation .</brief_summary>
