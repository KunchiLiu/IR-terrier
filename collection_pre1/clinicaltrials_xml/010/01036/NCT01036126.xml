	<brief_summary>Background : - Relapse drug abuse often happen presence stimulus associate previous drug use , also know cue . Drug-taking behavior appear partly control cue . Some research suggest cue-induced crave state responsible drug use relapse , research suggest cue control drug take without conscious crave even awareness . Researchers interested use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study individual respond drug-related cue cue affect crave conscious unconscious level . Objectives : - To determine drug-related stimulus ( cue ) affect think , information processing , body reaction current drug user . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age dependent either tobacco crack-cocaine , healthy volunteer dependent either drug . Design : - The study require two session , train session test session , take place within 48 hour . Between two test session , participant may consume alcohol , tobacco , illegal drug , must restrict caffeine consumption . - During first session , participant complete questionnaire tobacco/cocaine use craving , train task perform MRI scanner . - During second session , participant perform concentration task look picture , tobacco/cocaine relate . Body reaction heart rate , pupil dilation , sweat measure session . Some participant actual MRI scanning , others mock MRI scanning . - After MRI session , participant complete questionnaire crave response scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Relapse drug abuse often happen presence stimulus associate previous drug-use , drug-taking behavior appear partly control cue . While theory postulate facilitation mediate cue-induced craving state , others hypothesize underlying process highly automatize happen without conscious control even awareness . One way approach psychological mechanism cue reactivity measure disruption ongoing mental activity drug-related material dependent individual manipulate degree cognitive evaluative process unfold . Craving measurement condition elucidate relationship automatic processing versus conscious evaluation drug cue . Autonomic neural correlate identify concomitant psychophysiological fMRI record . Results study shed light role spontaneous automatic reaction versus cognitive evaluation different measure cue reactivity . By help elucidate psychological mechanism neurobiological basis drug-cue reactivity dependent individual , may substantial implication understand mechanisms treatment drug dependence . Thus , direct benefit subject participate experiment , result may benefit health society . MRI-related risk subject ( injury metal implant , claustrophobia , temporary deafness due loud banging noise ) minimize prescreening provide earplug . Drug-related cue may induce acute craving ; subject dismiss craving level return baseline .</detailed_description>
