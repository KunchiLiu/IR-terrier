	<brief_summary>Background : - Cues relate past drug use induce particular pattern brain activation , correlate crave cocaine active cocaine abuser . Researchers interested determine role brain chemical dopamine cue-elicited well spontaneous crave cocaine . - To study role dopamine cocaine craving , researcher use positron emission tomography ( PET ) compare neural reaction cocaine user non-substance-abusing healthy volunteer . Researchers hope data gather study lead development effective anti-craving medication . Objectives : - To clarify role dopamine cue-elicited response contribute cocaine abuse . - To determine PET result study differ various mean administer PET chemical . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 44 year age either current cocaine user ( least twice per week ) healthy volunteer without history drug abuse . Design : - Cocaine-using participant enter inpatient clinical research ward National Institute Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) Addiction Research Center 2 night day study . In addition , participant stay overnight NIDA evening PET session discharge following day . Cocaine-using participant require perform balance test study provide baseline response case require anti-anxiety medication cope effect study . - Control subject require stay overnight arrive outpatient PET session . All participant require abstain alcohol caffeine consumption midnight study session , permit smoke day test . - - On day study , participant undergo practice session set PET scan equipment . Following practice session , participant show video recording image related nature ( e.g. , seashell ) drug abuse ( e.g. , drug paraphernalia ) . Participant reaction study PET monitoring , study conduct two separate PET session break . Individuals cocaine-using group may receive anti-anxiety medication stimulus cue increase anxiety related cocaine craving . - Different group participant receive different method PET chemical administration , researcher compare method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cues relate past drug use induce particular pattern brain activation , correlate crave cocaine active cocaine abuser . The propose research design assess role dopamine cue-elicited well spontaneous crave cocaine . Cocaine abuser control subject present stimulus complex relate drug abuse ( cocaine cue : videotape depict drug use , drug paraphernalia ) nature ( neutral cue : videotape depict item shell pinecone ) . The effect cue condition striatal D2-like dopamine ( DA ) receptor change intrasynaptic dopamine measure positron emission tomography ( PET ) . The PET data correlate subjective self-reports mood , particularly measure crave . These result compare two subject group . This research help clarify role dopamine cue-elicited response contribute cocaine abuse . Ultimately , result obtain may lead development anti-craving medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age : Subjects cocaine abuser control group volunteer either gender , age 21 44 year . 2 . History Drug Abuse : For cocaine abuser group , regular current use cocaine require ( least twice per week ) ongoing least two year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Psychiatric disease : DSM IV criterion use . No subject current axis I diagnosis substance abuse disorder allow . No subject lifetime history schizophrenic disorder allow . 2 . History Drug Abuse : Cocaine user exclude toxicology screen time obtain informed consent positive illicit drug cocaine . Volunteers control group history intravenous drug abuse history psychostimulant drug abuse exclude . Axis I diagnose substance abuse disorder nicotine abuse and/or dependence exclusionary criterion volunteer control group . 3 . CNS disease : Structural brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasms , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , history neurological disease , history head trauma ( defined loss consciousness &gt; 2 min require hospitalization ) . 4 . Cardiovascular disease : Advanced coronary artery disease , endocarditis cardiac disease likely result cerebral embolism . 5 . Pulmonary disease : Significant obstructive pulmonary disease , tuberculosis , bronchospasm ( asthma , emphysema , bronchitis ) . 6 . Systemic disease : Endocrinopathies , renal hepatic failure , autoimmune disease involve CNS . 7 . Miscellaneous : Hematocrit &lt; 3536 ( woman ) &lt; 39 ( men ) , prostatic hypertrophy chronic inflammation . 8 . Claustrophobia : Subjects question potential discomfort enclose space , PET MRI scanner . 9 . Because potentially harmful effect radiation exposure fetuses infant , female subject pregnant , nursing , plan become pregnant show evidence reliable birth control exclude participation . 10 . Arterial circulation hand : Evidence inadequate patency radial ulnar artery , determine either Doppler flow measurement positive Allen 's test , exclusionary criterion insertion arterial catheter . Potential subject adequate arterial circulation hand otherwise meet criterion could include study venous blood sample draw . 11 . Radiation exposure : Any subject sufficient prior radiation exposure research purpose ( i.e. , apart medical procedure diagnostic therapeutic purpose ) prior begin study exceed 5.0 rem previous 12 month 3.0 rem previous 3 month exclude . 12 . Other medication : Volunteers currently take psychoactive medication , currently prescribe drug affect central neurotransmitter system , exclude study . 13 . HIV positive individual exclude HIV infection development AIDS produce abnormality brain function , particular basal ganglion ( Rottenberg et al. , 1987 ) , propose make measurement [ 11C ] raclopride binding .</criteria>
