	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) often refer hypercoagulable state . However , contribution coagulation activation pathogenesis SCD remain uncertain . Pulmonary hypertension ( PHT ) common complication associate significant morbidity mortality . Autopsy study SCD patient PHT show evidence situ thrombosis involve pulmonary vessel , similar finding non-sickle cell patient PHT . Anticoagulation report benefit non-sickle cell patient PHT . With evidence increase coagulation activation SCD , PHT represent clinical endpoint may use evaluate contribution coagulation activation pathophysiology SCD . The investigator hypothesize increased thrombin generation , well platelet activation central pathophysiology SCD contribute occurrence several SCD-related complication , include PHT . As consequence , treatment modality down-regulate thrombin generation would expect delay progression PHT result improve survival patient SCD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As result presence large vessel thrombotic complication , well biochemical evidence ongoing coagulation activation , sickle cell disease ( SCD ) often refer hypercoagulable state . However , contribution coagulation activation pathogenesis SCD remain uncertain . While majority clinical study use anticoagulant show convincing benefit prevention treatment acute pain episode , study small poorly control . Furthermore , acute pain episode appear result occlusion postcapillary venule interaction red blood cell cellular element vascular endothelium subendothelial matrix protein , may ideal clinical endpoint assess effect anticoagulation SCD patient . Pulmonary hypertension ( PHT ) , common complication associate significant morbidity mortality , histopathologic finding situ thrombosis involve pulmonary vessel , represent clinical endpoint likely due , least part , increase thrombin generation , may therefore used evaluate contribution coagulation activation pathophysiology SCD . Twenty patient sickle cell anemia ( HbSS ) sickle beta zero thalassemia ( Sickle beta zero thalassemia ) mild PHT meet eligibility requirement enrol , 10 patient receive anticoagulation warfarin 10 receive placebo rfor 12 month treatment .</detailed_description>
