	<brief_title>Comparison Continuous Non-invasive Arterial Pressure ( CNAP ) With Invasive Arterial Pressure Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CNAP monitor continuously measure blood pressure use finger cuff . It show good agreement invasive blood pressure measurement anaesthesia induction maintenance surgery . In critical ill patient cardiac arrhythmia probably confound factor affect accuracy interchangeability CNAP . As systolic arterial CNAP pressure comparison mean pressure show statistical interchangeability invasive measurement , mean pressure consider make therapy decision . A problem miss standard criterion comparison continuously device invasive pressure .</detailed_description>
