In response need develop Long Term Recovery Management ( LTRM ) model . LTRM predicate initiate long-term addiction management onset substance abuse treatment , extend length treatment , expedite transition intensive treatment maintenance behavioral change , adapt treatment intensity patient 's response treatment , actively facilitate therapeutic alliance . LTRM combine 3 establish treatment technique ( Community Reinforcement Approach , Contingency Management , Facilitated Therapeutic Alliance ) , demonstrate efficacy , chronic disease model . In addition , patient case keep open , thereby remove potential obstacle re-engagement stepped-up care , indicate . The LTRM model emphasize : engagement continuous long-term treatment recovery support , therapeutic alliance , early re-intervention main mechanism maintenance behavioral change .</detailed_description>
