	<brief_title>Interstitial Fluid Pressure ( IFP ) Pilot Study Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor Pressure Testing : If find eligible take part study , pressure three tumor measure . Medical photography also use documentation need . This do melanoma outpatient clinic . You ask lie skin lesion clean betadine ( iodine ) different clean agent allergic iodine . The skin lesion numb anesthetic . A topical anesthetic local anesthetic use numb surface body part . Thirty minute IFP measurement , EMLA patch ( Lidocaine 2.5 % Prilocaine 2.5 % ) apply surface study . Your treat doctor may prescribe pain drug help discomfort measurement may cause . For tumor measurement , tip needle insert skin lesion ( similar biopsy needle ) . The needle connected machine read pressure inside tumor . The measurement take second . The whole process , include clean numbing lesion , take 3-4 minute . You stay clinic monitored side effect 1 hour follow tumor measurement . At 3 day measurement , ask experienced side effect . If coming clinic , call . Length Study : You study complete two cycle chemotherapy second set tumor measurement do . Follow-Up : After 2 cycle chemotherapy , check tumor response . The IFP study finish time . You also receive phone call 30 day procedure see experienced side effect . This investigational study . Measuring tumor pressure chemotherapy investigational . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
