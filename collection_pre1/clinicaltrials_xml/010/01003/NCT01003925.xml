	<brief_title>Conjoint Analysis Treatment Preferences Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) major cause disability elderly , second cardiovascular disease . The medical treatment OA alleviate symptom , halt disease progression . Exercise effective intervention patient get adequate relief exercise whose disease severe warrant joint replacement , variety intermediate step include medication joint injection . There nontrivial tradeoff choice . This project explore choice make patient significant osteoarthritis knee use specialize computer software decision aid . Traditional decision aid present information way help patient make decision consistent value . However , sort decision aid usually provide feedback clinician researcher patient 's thought , preference , reason . We propose use conjoint analysis , analytic tool assess preference use extensively market recently introduce medical decision making . In conjoint analysis , consumer ( market context ) subject ( medical research context ) present pairs choice . The marketing researcher might ask , instance , consumer would rather $ 1000 laptop 250 MB RAM , $ 1200 laptop 500 MB RAM . The answer allow accurate calculation subject 's utility money RAM . Extending question element allow utility laptop 's speed , weight , battery life , screen size calculate allow computer maker optimize product line . Instead one sweet spot price feature happy medium , every laptop offer perceive potential consumer offer reasonable value money . Fraenkel others use conjoint analysis study osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis . Conjoint analysis present choice pair subject ; instance , would feel cream offer extremely low risk complication moderate relief symptom , versus medication offer moderate risk major complication well symptom relief ? As result process , utility generate mathematically preference . Because know relatively little patient feel use conjoint analysis , make tradeoff among factor conjoint analysis permit u ass , project also utilize patient focus group explore issue .</detailed_description>
