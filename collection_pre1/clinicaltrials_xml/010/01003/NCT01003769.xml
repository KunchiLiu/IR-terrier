	<brief_title>Lenalidomide AT-101 Treating Patients With Relapsed B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide combination AT-101 ( R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid ) . ( Phase I ) II . To assess overall response rate lenalidomide combination AT-101 . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate lenalidomide combination AT-101 6 month 12 month . II . To evaluate time progression ( TTP ) combination lenalidomide + AT-101 . III . To evaluate safety combination patient relapse B-CLL . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct correlative study understand mechanism antitumor activity lenalidomide lenalidomide + AT-101 . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Beginning course 3 , patient also receive AT-101 PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 11 course ( 49-56 day course 12 last course treatment ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
