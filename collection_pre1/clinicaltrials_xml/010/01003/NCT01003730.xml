	<brief_summary>This research do determine way investigator improve technique use assist patient breathe surgery . The majority surgery require patient concurrently undergo general anesthesia . This usually include breathe tube machine breathes patient duration surgery . The doctor would like investigate effect type anesthesia healthy adult patient whether improve way give general anesthesia patient . The investigator plan ask approximately 200 patient participate . If patient decide participate study , addition make standard anesthetic care receive . The patient additionally monitor adequate oxygenation blood well level inflammation blood lung . The patient ' breathe tube bath warm normal saline suction twice operation . When procedure do patient asleep aware happen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Different Ventilator Strategies Inflammation Injury Normal Lungs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability provide mechanical ventilation injure may protect normal lung major surgical procedure long duration may improve postoperative outcome decrease morbidity mortality . The aim current study identify ventilator strategy less damaging normal lung . The investigator plan compare three ventilation strategy commonly utilized operating room normal lung . One group ventilate high tidal volume ( 15 mL/kg PBW ) low PEEP ( 3 cm H2O ) , another group ventilate low tidal volume ( 6 mL/kg PBW ) low PEEP ( 3 cm H2O ) final group ventilate low tidal volume ( 6 mL/kg PBW ) high PEEP ( 10 cm H2O ) . This study show effect commonly use method ventilation pulmonary mechanic , systemic pulmonary inflammatory marker outcomes patient normal lung undergo surgery long duration .</detailed_description>
