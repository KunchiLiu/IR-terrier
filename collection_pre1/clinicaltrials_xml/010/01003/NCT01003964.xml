	<detailed_description>Cisplatin-based chemotherapy currently consider standard treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , overall response 30-40 % , suggest majority patient respond platinum . Subsequently , patient experience treatment failure platinum-based therapy typically receive pemetrexed docetaxel second-line treatment , response rate approximately 7 % 10 % . The primary objective randomize phase II study compare Response Rate sequence treatment approach patient advance NSCLC . Additionally , development gene expression profile genotype predict response commonly use chemotherapy may provide unique opportunity well utilize drug show effective first- second-line therapy . Here , conduct pharmacogenomic study provide rational approach treatment NSCLC develop predictor cisplatin ( first-line agent ) pemetrexed docetaxel ( second-line agent ) sensitivity demonstrate clinical value identify appropriate drug basis sensitivity profile treatment regimen individual patient . Such approach likely maximize response chemotherapy may change current empirical paradigm NSCLC therapy .</detailed_description>
