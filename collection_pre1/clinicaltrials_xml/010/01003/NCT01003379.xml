Attention disorder , slow information processing , work memory disorder , lack flexibility adaptive strategy symptoms cognitive impairment devastate impact function , employment , social status patient schizophrenia . Older typical neuroleptic medication ( e.g. , haloperidol , fluphenazine ) improve cognition . In fact , haloperidol show induce cognitive impairment schizophrenic patient . Novel atypical antipsychotic , risperidone , clozapine , olanzapine , seem produce gain cognition . This improvement may reflect diminution extrapyramidal side effect typical high potency neuroleptic . Alternatively , might reflect effective symptom reduction novel antipsychotic , direct cognitive enhancement effect new agent variety neurotransmitter , receptor , gene expression . Even new antipsychotic medication improve cognition , normalize . Presently , approve therapy CDS . However , schizophrenic patient , nicotine improve multiple cognitive domain , include work memory attention . Furthermore , base strong body evidence range genetic mapping clinical trial , alpha7 NNR subtype emerge primary therapeutic target relevant CDS core symptom schizophrenia</brief_summary>
