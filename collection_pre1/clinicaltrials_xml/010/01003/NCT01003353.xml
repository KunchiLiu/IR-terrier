	<brief_summary>The study aim investigate effect strength train maximal strength , walk ability neural function chronic stroke patient . The strength training intervention study different previous intervention stroke patient . Maximal Strength Training ( MST ) involve weight 90 % participant 1 repetition maximum focus explosive development force . This study use principles unilateral leg press plantarflexion exercise . Only 2 previous study investigate high intensity strength train stroke patient use intensity 80 % 1RM . Previous MST intervention show large increase strength , rate force development transfer improved walking economy . The investigator predict MST give large increase strength , improve rate force development ( RFD ) walk economy . The investigator expect good neural function account improvement . This study could provide evidence adoption completely different method strength rehabilitation stroke survivor .</brief_summary>
