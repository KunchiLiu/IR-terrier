	<brief_summary>Dysfunctional voiding often associate constipation . The association constipation urologic pathologic process previously describe since 1950 's , past decade clinician pay attention relationship recognize existence term dysfunctional elimination syndrome ( DES ) . This term use reflect broad spectrum functional disturbance may affect urinary tract include functional bowl disturbance classify follow : - Functional disorder filling : overactive bladder , distention bladder insensate bladder , may associate fecal impaction rectal distention infrequent bowel movement - Functional disorder emptying : over-recruitment pelvic floor activity void cause interrupt and/or incomplete emptying also associate defecation difficulty due non- relaxation puborectalis muscle , dyssynergic defecation pain defecation Several different therapeutic option use patient dysfunctional void mainly decrease bladder outlet obstruction . These treatment include , alpha adrenergic antagonist , botulinum toxin less optimum . One possible explanation drug failure include inability medication relax striate muscle pelvic floor necessary voiding . To date data evaluate role baclofen striate muscle external anal sphincter , essential defecation process .</brief_summary>
