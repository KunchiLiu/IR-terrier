	<brief_summary>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH ) , also call pseudotumor cerebri , disorder elevate intracranial pressure unknown cause [ Corbett , et al. , 1982 ; Wall , et al. , 1991 ] . Its incidence 22.5 new case year per 100,000 overweight woman childbearing age , rise [ Garrett , et al. , 2004 ] parallel obesity epidemic . It affect 100,000 Americans . Most patient suffer debilitate headache . Because pressure optic nerve ( papilledema ) , 86 % degree permanent visual loss 10 % develop severe visual loss [ Wall , et al. , 1991 ] . Interventions prevent loss sight , unproven efficacy , include diet , diuretic acetazolamide , repeat spinal tap , optic nerve sheath fenestration surgery , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) shunting procedure . The purported goal therapy lower intracranial pressure ; however , unclear treatment work mechanism . None strategy verify properly design clinical trial . Thus , confusion , uncertainty , weak scientific rationale guide treatment decision . This trial study subject mild visual loss IIH ( 1 ) establish convincing , evidence-based treatment strategy IIH restore protect vision , ( 2 ) follow subject 4 year observe long-term treatment outcome ( 3 ) determine cause IIH . To meet aim , trial divide 12-month intervention phase 3-year observational phase . Subjects require complete observational phase study , ask consented observational phase study conclusion intervention phase ( 12 month ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical Phase : Phase II Investigators : NORDIC Network sit Study Centers : 38 study center Coordinating Center - University Rochester Statistical Center - University Rochester Study Period Planned enrollment duration : 2 year Planned duration treatment : 6 month follow open-label treatment Planned duration follow-up : 4.5 year Study Objectives : The primary objective determine efficacy diet plus acetazolamide v diet alone reduce reverse visual loss subject mild visual loss . The secondary objective identify proteomic genetic risk factor IIH screen large cohort IIH patient control . Study Population This project enroll 166 individual IIH 18-60 year age . We anticipate population primarily compose woman childbearing year overweight . 154 control subject also enrol . Control subject match closely possibly age , sex , race , ethnicity weight subject enrol site . Study Design : Multi-center , double-blind randomize intervention study follow 4-year observation period . Subjects randomize diet acetazolamide diet placebo . The study use 250 mg acetazolamide match placebo tablet take food meal bedtime . The subject begin one tablet four time daily , meal bedtime first week . Beginning Day 7 , subject increase dosage 1 tablet every 4 day final dosage 4 tablet four time daily ( 4 gram ) reach side effect prohibit increase dosage . If study drug tolerate dose 250 mg , 125 mg ( 1/2 tablet ) try . If tolerate , pharmacologic treatment give . After 6 month visit , subject transition study medication acetazolamide ( open label ) replace one tablet study drug 250 mg acetazolamide every four day . The acetazolamide dose titrate manner similar initial study drug schedule maximum tolerate dose acetazolamide . To avoid treat subject ( may initially assign placebo ) unnecessarily , subject grade 0-1 papilledema taper study drug place acetazolamide unless persist headache pulse-synchronous tinnitus . If , place acetazolamide regardless low papilledema grade . At 9-month follow-up visit , make sure subject ' vision stable transition study medication . After 9 month visit , medication prescribe subject 's treating physician . The intervention phase study end subject 's 12 month visit subject invite participate observational phase study consent willing .

Other disorder cause visual loss except refractive error amblyopia include cell vitreous iritis 10 . Inability provide reliable reproducible visual field examination ( failure maintain fixation use eye monitoring device , 15 % false positive error 11 . Abnormal blood work-up indicate medical systemic condition associate raise intracranial pressure ( ICP ) 12 . Exposure drug , substance disorder associate elevation intracranial pressure within 2 month diagnosis lithium , vitamin A , tetracycline , steroid withdrawal ( see table Manual Procedures ( MOP ) condition drug ) 13 . Other condition require diuretic , steroid pressure lower agent include topiramate 14 . Presence medical condition renal stone would contraindicate use study drug ( acetazolamide ) 15 . Pregnancy unwillingness subject childbearing potential use contraception first year study 16 . Presence physical , mental , social condition likely affect follow-up ( drug addiction , terminal illness , telephone , homeless ) 17 . Anticipation move site area within six month unwillingness return follow-up . Route Dosage Form : 250 mg acetazolamide tablet match placebo take food 4 time daily . Subjects titrate maximum dose 4 tablet 4 time daily ( 4 gram ) tolerate . If subject able tolerate dose 250 mg , 125 mg ( 1/2 tablet ) may try . If tolerate , pharmacologic treatment give . Duration Treatment : 6 month randomize treatment follow open label acetazolamide treatment . After 9-month visit medication prescribe subject 's treating physician . The intervention phase study end Month 12 subject invite continue observational phase . Primary Outcome Measure ( ) : The primary outcome measure change baseline Month 6 PMD ( perimetric mean deviation ) eye severe initial visual loss . Secondary Outcome Measure : CSF pressure measurement lumbar puncture Number abnormal perimetry test location Visual field examination rating ( improve , remain , worsen ) Papilledema grade QOL assessment Dietary Outcomes ( BMI , Waist circumference , urinary sodium ) Safety Outcomes : Adverse event tabulate treatment group , severity , perceive relationship study intervention Sample Size Considerations</detailed_description>
