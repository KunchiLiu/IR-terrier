	<brief_summary>Syncope , define transient loss consciousness , account 700,000 annual U.S. emergency department visit may herald life-threatening condition old adult ( age≥60 year ) . Existing risk prediction instrument reliably identify among old patient safely discharge home emergency department . As result , majority old patient without clear cause syncope hospitalize diagnostic evaluation . However , current admission practice characterize low diagnostic yield , clearly improve outcome , account $ 2.4 billion annual hospital cost . Most admitted patient discharge within 48 hour , approximately 50 % patient identify cause syncope hospitalization . The implementation expedite standardized Emergency Department Observation Syncope Protocol ( EDOSP ) may safely reduce hospitalization old patient syncope . The investigator propose pilot randomize trial implement evaluate EDOSP two emergency department . This study follow exploratory Specific Aims : 1 . To compare admission rate length-of-stay associate EDOSP standard care . 2 . To compare serious outcome rate associate EDOSP standard care . 3 . To compare quality-of-life associate EDOSP standard care . 4 . To compare incremental cost cost-effectiveness EDOSP standard care . Over one-year period , 120 intermediate-risk old adult present syncope two study site randomize 1 2 arm : 1 . ) intervention arm : expedite standardize EDOSP care ; 2 . ) control arm : routine care consist admission emergency department . If pilot trial suggest EDOSP safely reduce admission , investigator plan large study power evaluate clinical , quality-of-life , economic outcome . A successful EDOSP intervention would important clinical policy implication improve emergency department care old adult syncope .</brief_summary>
