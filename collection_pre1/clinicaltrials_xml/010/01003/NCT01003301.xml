	<brief_summary>This research do study effect drug omalizumab ( Xolair ) people cat allergy . The investigator use omalizumab study change cell nose , cell blood cell skin cause allergy . The investigator compare change nose change skin blood cell . Objective : To test hypothesis treatment omalizumab decrease nasal allergen challenge late-phase eosinophil count nasal brushing time blood basophil become hypo-responsive vitro allergen exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Omalizumab ( Anti-IgE ) Late-phase Response Nasal Allergen Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel group design study include 3.5 month treatment omalizumab placebo 3 month follow-up . All subject cat allergic . Twenty four subject ( 1:1 randomization ) undergo cat allergen nasal challenge prior treatment another challenge 2 month treatment blood basophils become hyporesponsive cat allergen vitro . A second group 10 subject ( 1:1 active : placebo ) , undergo nasal challenge . This group participate ancillary study effect omalizumab gene expression profile peripheral blood cell study .</detailed_description>
