	<brief_summary>This randomize , laboratory-blinded study healthy male non-pregnant female design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity inactivate influenza H1N1 vaccine ( AdimFlu-S ) . In adult cohort , volunteer randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive 2 injection AdimFlu-S ( A/H1N1 ) 15 mcg HA 3 week apart , 2 injection AdimFlu-S ( A/H1N1 ) 30 mcg HA 3 week apart 1 injection AdimFlu-S ( A/H1N1 ) 15 mcg HA . In elder cohort , volunteer randomize 1:1 ratio receive 2 injection AdimFlu-S ( A/H1N1 ) 15 mcg HA 3 week apart 2 injection AdimFlu-S ( A/H1N1 ) 30 mcg HA 3 week apart . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 6 week follow first vaccination , serious adverse event new-onset chronic medical condition 7 month post first vaccination ; reactogenicity vaccines 7 day follow vaccination . Immunogenicity test include hemagglutinin inhibition ( HAI ) test serum obtain first vaccination , three six week first vaccination .</brief_summary>
