	<brief_summary>This study aim test safety two new malaria vaccine AdCh63 MSP1 MVA MSP1 . These vaccine consist inactivated virus modify âˆ’ reproduce ( replicate ) human , also include genetic material ( gene ) malaria protein express malaria parasite blood stage infection . The vaccine design stimulate immune response malaria protein ( immunogenicity describe nature magnitude immune response ) , provide protection malaria infection . This protection demonstrate nonhuman study . Although vaccine give human , similar vaccine use virus different malaria gene give human . In study , vaccine show safe . They also provide evidence laboratory test immunogenicity . In study investigator main aim ensure new vaccine give alone combination safe . The investigator increase dose first vaccine ( AdCh63 MSP1 ) give volunteer initial dose safe . The investigator also wish ensure challenge small number volunteer receive vaccine malaria infection bite infect mosquito ( sporozoite challenge ) safe . Sporozoite challenge widely use human test effectiveness malaria vaccine consider well establish , reliable , predictable safe system.In study investigator also look evidence immunogenicity new vaccine , whether delay develop malaria follow sporozoite challenge . The study conduct University Oxfords Centre Clinical Vaccinology Tropical Medicine ( CCVTM ) . The challenge part study take place insectary Imperial College , ( Infection Immunity Section ) London .</brief_summary>
