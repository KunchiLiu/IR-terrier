	<brief_summary>A study conduct IFPRI Haiti provide first programmatic evidence , use cluster randomize evaluation design , prevent child undernutrition child two year age ( PM2A ) integrate program providing food ration , BCC preventive health nutrition service feasible highly effective . The study 's principal aim compare newly design preventive approach traditional ( recuperative ) food assist MCHN program approach , therefore include two comparison group : one group communities randomly assign preventive approach another group assign recuperative approach . For logistical financial reason , study include randomize control group receive intervention . The Haiti study design well-suited achieve main goal - i.e . test whether preventive approach effective recuperative approach prevent child undernutrition - leave number question unanswered . The present study address several question , allow refine PM2A approach , facilitate replication different context , maximize impact cost-effectiveness future programming . The study conduct Guatemala Burundi . The key research objective : 1 . Impact cost effectiveness : Assess impact cost effectiveness PM2A child nutritional status . 2 . Optimal composition size food ration PM2A : Assess differential absolute impact vary size type food incorporate food ration PM2A . More specifically , assess differential effect different size family food ration , assess impact substitute individual food ration new micronutrient-rich product lipid-based nutrient supplement ( LNS ) micronutrient Sprinkles . 3 . Optimal time duration PM2A : Assess differential absolute impact vary time duration exposure PM2A child nutritional status .</brief_summary>
