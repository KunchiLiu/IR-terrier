	<brief_summary>Reduced mobility often long-term problem face chronic leg weakness result stroke . Recent innovation stroke therapy apply motor learn principle improve motor skill regular practice activity use weak limb . Because ankle provide critical torque normal walk mobility function , impairment affect ankle pose major limitation achieve optimal mobility recovery . To address develop novel ankle robot ( Anklebot ) enhance physical therapy improve walk mobility stroke . This computer control device provide assistance user complete movement , assist user active . Motor learn require active involvement task-related practice mediate brain plasticity . While voluntary movement important remodel motor control circuit , brain mechanism reward motivation also play important role . Core brain network involve reward motivation increase person 's involvement surroundings , focus attention prompt one approach reward avoid punishment . This increase involvement elevate emotion associate show enhance performance , memory learning . The purpose study investigate response brain motor behavior stroke patient use Anklebot 3-week / 3-session/week motor learn base training . These response compare 3-week delayed entry period participant perform at-home walk program equal time . After 3-week delayed entry walk program , subject divide low high reward-feedback group . The low reward-feedback group receive Anklebot train immediate feedback target success , without cumulative score minimal social interaction researcher . The high-reward group receive cumulative score ongoing social support , eligible prize session study 's completion . All subject play game noninvasive electroencephalography electromyography record brain muscle activity . In addition analyze brain information Anklebot training , ankle motor control walk function also assess immediately first last robotic training session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After inform consent obtain , pilot study require least eleven visit subject . The first visit entail screen eligibility test last 3 hour occur VAMC ( Veteran 's Administration Medical Center ) Geriatric Assessment Clinic ( GAC ) . The second third visit last approximately 3 hour VAMC Human Motor Performance Laboratory involve collection noninvasive EEG , surface EMG ECG , practice ankle movement use ankle robot play video game . In addition measure gait balance function assess pre- post- Anklebot training . For next 3-weeks subject take part at-home , monitor ( log ) walk program . The next seven visit ( train program ) entail practice ankle movement use ankle robot play video game , collection motor control data collection electrophysiological data.. Visit eleven ( final ) visit 2 &amp; 3 . Visit 1 : Screening evaluation include review medical record , medical neurologic examination determine eligibility . Clinical evaluation also include Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) Center Epidemiologic Study ( CES-D ) . Clinical suspicion evidence screen instrument dementia , depression , cognitive deficit could interfere study preclude study evaluation prompt referral psychiatry appropriate health professional evaluation . The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics ( ANAM ) also administer comprehensive neuropsychological tool measure multiple facet neuropsychological process pertain cognitive function motor learn . In addition participant ask walk 10 meter 3 time across gait measure mat prefer speed safety harness accompany ( assist ) experience research assistant . This help determine deficit severity group data analysis . Finally , standard neurological examination conduct medically credentialed staff . Visit 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 11 : After study enrollment medical screening , subject test Anklebot EEG , EMG , heart rate ( ECG ) record . First , subject fit stretch-lycra cap house 64 recess EEG sensor form tin . The participant 's skin lightly abrade rubbed end Q-tip sensor site remove oil dead epidermal tissue establish good conductance EEG signal . The skin broken . Using blunt applicator attach syringe , FDA-approved non-toxic conducting gel apply open 64 record sensor establish continuous contact gel skin record site correspond sensor . Recording sensor also position skin leave eye monitor eye movement well ear lobe serve `` non-brain '' reference site . A ground electrode site apply frontal region . The eye-channel reference site lightly abrade pad , rub alcohol , prepare conduct gel enable continuous connection scalp sensor surface . Also , surface EMG electrodes apply tibialis anterior , gastrocnemius , , need , peroneal muscle paretic leg . Leads ECG record apply bilaterally location immediately inferior clavicle . Once set-up complete , subject ask walk 10 instrumented gait mat record gait parameter 3 prefer 3 fast walking trial . Subjects ask repeat walk task perform concurrent cognitive task consist solve verbally report answer simple arithmetic problem . They wear gait belt attend closely research staff walk receive seat rest require prevent fatigue . A second test measure balance control record 30 second trial postural sway quiet stand force plate . Three balance condition include eye open , eye close , eye open perform concurrent cognitive task consist solve verbally report answer simple arithmetic problem . Seated rest provide need . After baseline functional test participant seat chair ankle robot attach paretic leg mean orthopedic knee brace orthopedic shoe . Pads cushion apply need proper fitting , knee brace mount chair stability . The leg rest cushion support knee 45 degree foot free move . Once set-up complete , subject ask `` play '' series videogames plantar- dorsi-flexing paretic ankle move corresponding cursor computer screen order hit slowly move target . The first game two-minutes duration play without robotic assistance ass subject ' baseline motor control ability . Subsequently , 6 game 4-minutes duration provide differ level robotic support guide encourage subject complete prescribe ankle movement . The nature amount robotic support vary across session promote short-term motor learn control paretic ankle . Upon completion performance-based training series , repeat two-minute unassisted game complete session. ` Finally , subject ask repeat postural sway walk test . Visits 4-10 : participant seat chair ankle robot attach paretic leg mean orthopedic knee brace orthopedic shoe . Pads cushion apply need proper fitting , knee brace mount chair stability . The leg rest cushion support knee 45 degree foot free move . Once set-up complete , subject ask `` play '' series videogames plantar- dorsi-flexing paretic ankle move corresponding cursor computer screen order hit slowly move target . The first game two-minutes duration play without robotic assistance ass subject ' baseline motor control ability . Subsequently , 6 game 4-minutes duration provide differ level robotic support guide encourage subject complete prescribe ankle movement . The nature amount robotic support vary across session promote short-term motor learn control paretic ankle . Upon completion performance-based training series , repeat two-minute unassisted game complete session . During training session electrophysiological data acquire , motor control data acquire Anklebot .</detailed_description>
