	<detailed_description>Dengue virus cause dengue fever severe condition , dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome . Dengue virus common tropical subtropical region world infection dengue virus lead cause hospitalization death child many tropical Asian country . For reason , World Health Organization ( WHO ) make development dengue virus vaccine top priority . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity five version live , attenuate , tetravalent dengue virus vaccine call TetraVax-DV . This study enroll healthy adult 18-50 year old . Participants randomly assign receive one five version TetraVax-DV placebo . At vaccination study visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , blood urine collection , vital sign measurement . Participants receive one injection assign vaccine placebo upper arm . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic 30 minute observation . At home , participant monitor record temperature three time day 16 day . Additional study visit occur Days 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 42 , 180 physical exam , assessment symptom , blood urine collection . Some participant attend additional study visit Day 60 . Participants receive one five version vaccine ask take part optional substudy evaluate safety immunogenicity second vaccination 6 month first vaccination . In substudy , participant randomly assign receive either vaccine receive first part study placebo vaccine .
