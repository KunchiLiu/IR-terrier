	<brief_summary>A two-phase research study conduct . In Phase 1 study , cognitive behavioral therapy intervention insomnia implement small ( n = 5 ) group people moderate severe COPD insomnia . The intervention pilot-tested determine feasibility acceptability , intervention refine need . In Phase 2 study , two-group randomize control study ( n = 20 ) conduct test effect cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia intervention primary outcomes sleep quality fatigue secondary outcome mood functional performance . It hypothesize people COPD receive cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia demonstrate significant improvement sleep quality , fatigue , mood functional performance compare people COPD receive wellness program . This research yield valuable information regard effective intervention aim mitigate problem poor sleep quality , fatigue reduce ability perform value daily activity .
