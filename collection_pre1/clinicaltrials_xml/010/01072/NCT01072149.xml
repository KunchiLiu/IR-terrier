	<criteria>Outpatient/Inpatient ; Male female subject Subjects must give sign dated write informed consent participate . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile ) . Surgically sterile female define documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy . However questionable case , blood sample FSH &gt; 40MIU/ml estradiol &lt; 40pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory . OR Child bear potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree one follow acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly ( i.e . accordance approve product label instruction physician duration study screen followup contact ) : Complete abstinence intercourse screen followup contact ; Male partner sterile ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject entry study , male partner sole partner subject ; Implants levonorgestral insert least 1 month prior study medication administration beyond third successive year follow insertion ; Injectable progestogen administer least 1 month prior study medication administration ; Oral contraceptive ( combine progestogen ) administer least one monthly cycle prior study medication administration ; Double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) plus spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) ; An intrauterine device ( IUD ) , insert qualified physician , publish data show high expected failure rate le 1 % per year ; Estrogenic vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patch . Age : ≥40 year age Screening ( Visit 1 ) . COPD diagnosis : Subjects clinical history COPD accordance follow definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [ Celli , 2004 ] : COPD preventable treatable disease characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . Tobacco use : subject current prior history ≥10 packyears cigarette smoke Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Note : Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate pack year history . Number pack year = ( number cigarette per day/20 ) ) x number year smoke Severity Disease : Subject measure postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio ≤0.70 Screening ( Visit 1 ) . [ Pelligrino , 2005 ] Subjects measure postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 ≤ 70 % predict normal value calculate use NHANES III reference equation [ Hankinson , 1999 ] Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Postbronchodilator spirometry perform approximately 1015 minute subject selfadministered 4 inhalation ( i.e . total 400mcg . ) albuterol/salbutamol via MDI valvedholding chamber . The FEV1/FVC ratio FEV1 percent predict value calculate centralized spirometry equipment . Dyspnea : Achieved score ≥2 Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale ( mMRC , 04 scale ) Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Asthma : Subjects current diagnosis asthma . ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible current diagnosis COPD ) α1antitrypsin deficiency : Subjects α1 antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD Other respiratory disorder : Subjects active tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease Lung resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Screening Chest Xray ( CT scan ) : Subjects chest Xray ( CT scan ) thats reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . A chest Xray must take Screening chest Xray CT scan available within 6 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) Hospitalization : Subjects hospitilized due poorly control COPD 12 week Screening ( Visit 1 ) Poorly control COPD : Subjects poorly control COPD define occurrence follow 6 week prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) : acute worsen COPD manage subject corticosteroid antibiotic , require treatment prescribed physician Lower respiratory tract infection : Subjects low respiratory tract infection require use antibiotic within 6 week prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) Other diseases/abnormalities : Subjects historical current evidence clinically significant cardiovascular ( i.e. , pacemaker ) , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) haematological abnormality uncontrolled . Significant define disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Peptic Ulcer disease : Subjects clinically significant peptic ulcer disease uncontrolled . Hypertension : Subjects clinically significant hypertension uncontrolled Cancer : Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 5 year . Carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude subject consider cure within 5 year since diagnosis . Drug/food allergy : Subjects history hypersensitivity study medication ( e.g . betaagonists , corticosteroid ) component inhalation powder ( e.g . lactose , magnesium stearate ) . In addition , patient history severe milk protein allergy , opinion study physician , contraindicate subject 's participation also exclude . Drug/alcohol abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year Medication prior spirometry : Subjects medically unable withhold albuterol/salbutamol ipratropium 4hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . Additional medication : Use certain medication bronchodilator corticosteroid protocolspecific time prior Visit 1 ( Investigator discuss specific medication ) Oxygen therapy : Subjects receive treatment longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) nocturnal oxygen therapy require great 12 hour day . Oxygen prn use ( i.e . ≤12 hour per day ) exclusionary . Sleep apnea : Subjects clinically significant sleep apnea require use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) device . Pulmonary rehabilitation : Subjects participate acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program within 4 week prior Screening enter acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program study . Subjects maintenance phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program exclude . Noncompliance : Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Any infirmity , disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Questionable validity consent : Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study Prior use study medication/other investigational drug : Subjects previously randomize Phase IIa ( HZC111348 B2C111045 ) study Phase III ( i.e . HZC112206 , HZC112207 , HZC102970 , HZC102871 ) study . Subjects receive investigational drug within 30 day entry study ( Screening ) , within 5 drug halflives investigational drug , whichever long Affiliation investigator site : Study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator immediate family member aforementioned excluded participating study .</criteria>
