	<detailed_description>As life expectancy United States continue rise , maintenance physical independence among old Americans emerge major clinical public health priority . Efficient reliable locomotion , ability move without assistance , fundamental feature human functioning . Older people lose mobility less likely remain community , high rate morbidity , mortality , hospitalization experience poor quality life . Several study show regular physical activity improve physical performance , definitive evidence show mobility disability prevent lacking . A Phase 3 randomize control trial need fill evidence gap . The LIFE Study Phase 3 , multicenter randomize control trial ( RCT ) design compare moderate-intensity physical activity program successful age health education program 1,600 sedentary old person follow average 2.7 year . The primary outcome major mobility disability , define inability walk 400 m. Secondary outcome include cognitive function base Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST ) Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( HVLT ) ; serious fall injury ; persistent mobility disability ; combine outcome major mobility disability death ; disability activity daily live ; cost-effectiveness . Tertiary outcome include combine outcome mild cognitive impairment dementia , composite measure cognitive assessment battery , physical performance within pre-specified subgroup define basis race , gender baseline physical performance , sleep-wake disturbance , dyspnea , ventilatory capacity , cardiopulmonary event , cardiovascular event . The physical activity intervention consist primarily walk moderate intensity , low extremity resistance exercise , balance exercise , stretch behavioral counseling . The successful age intervention consist health education seminar regard health-related matter upper extremity stretch exercise . This trial provide definitive evidence regard whether physical activity effective practical prevent major mobility disability . These result crucial implication public health prevention rapidly age society , fill important gap knowledge practice evidence-based geriatric medicine . The study also yield valuable information concern efficacy effectiveness physical activity across broad spectrum important health outcome . The study impact clinical practice public health policy , , therefore , benefit individual society .
