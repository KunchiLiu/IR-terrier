	<brief_summary>The propose pilot project seed grant focus role intestinal serine-proteases pathogenesis diarrhea-predominant IBS ( D-IBS ) . In study assess serine-protease activity patient D-IBS also explore possible mechanism protease lead alteration intestinal physiology symptom patient . The general hypothesis propose research ( A ) level fecal serine-protease patient D-IBS abnormally increase ( B ) abnormal serine-protease activity lead to/is associate abnormal increase intestinal permeability therefore enables ( C ) chronic stimulation activation mucosal immune system patient . In addition , aim determine whither periodontal inflammation associate intestinal permeability serine protease activity .</brief_summary>
