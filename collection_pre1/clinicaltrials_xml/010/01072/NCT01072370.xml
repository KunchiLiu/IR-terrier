	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Cord Blood Stem Cell Infusion Treatment Cerebral Palsy Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study conduct observer-blinded crossover investigation safety efficacy autologous cord blood infusion child demonstrate non-progressive motor disability due brain dysfunction ( commonly call cerebral palsy ) apparent disorder brain development obstructive hydrocephalus . The degree delay motor development child unable sit independently 12 month age unable walk independently 18 month age . However , diagnosis one exclusion , enroll patient reach two year age . By age , likely condition would exclude . As Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) develop child 12 year age , maximum age recruitment 12 year . Any level cerebral palsy severity allow . The subject child whose parent save infant cord blood , clinical evidence non-progressive motor disability , whose parent intend cord blood infusion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must 1 year age le 12 year age time screen inclusion study . Clinical evidence nonprogressive motor disability due brain dysfunction . The subject ability sit independently one year age ability walk 18 month age . Have store umbilical cord blood Cord Blood Registry ( CBR ) meet selection test criterion . Willing comply study procedure . The nucleated cell available cord blood sample store CBR must exceed 1 X 107 cell per kg body weight . ( Note : Because cord blood collection process 16 year widely far less period , age subject likely considerably less 12 year age . Due amount due cord blood available subject , body weight subject usually exceed 25 kg ) . The patient must seizurefree seizure adequately control . If suspicion seizure EEG do prior inclusion . Have complicate medical issue would interfere blood drawing , venous access limit success unlikely Presence obstructive hydrocephalus . Presence progressive neurological disease . Presence significant defect brain development , schizencephaly agenesis corpus callosum Presence know chromosomal anomaly Presence major congenital anomaly Severe intrauterine growth restriction ( birth weight less 1800 gram ) Cord blood viability &lt; 60 % Positive infectious disease marker mother 's blood cord blood time collection . Evidence illness plan infusion date ( limited fever &gt; 38.5 , vomit , diarrhea , wheeze , crackle ) Pregnancy Use immunosuppressive drug Evidence know genetic disorder Impaired hepatic renal function</criteria>
