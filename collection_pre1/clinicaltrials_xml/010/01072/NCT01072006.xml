	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) PTSD characterize deficit attention , yet unclear whether related inability focus relevant information ignore non-relevant information . History TBI PTSD common return soldier OEF/OIF thus highly relevant veteran health care . It unclear TBI PTSD separately , together , affect one 's ability focus attention versus inhibit distract stimulus . This research investigate issue use work memory paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) entail subject instruct ignore stimulus remember stimuli result discrete biomarkers ( 1 ) task-related enhancement neural process well ( 2 ) suppression task-irrelevant neural process . In way , specific aspect attention TBI PTSD elucidate addition explore whether PTSD TBI additive , even synergist , effect combine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject 18 40 year age . In order include mTBI group , participant must sustain 1 3 mild TBIs . The criterion TBI consistent VA currently use ( i.e. , American Congress Rehabilitative Medicine ) . More specifically , patient sustain traumatically induce physiologic disruption brain function indicate least one following : period loss consciousness , loss memory event immediately accident , alteration mental status time accident , focal neurologic deficit . Additional criterion TBI include : TBI must sustain OEF OIF TBI must consist less 30 minute loss consciousness , posttraumatic amnesia le 1 hour , positive CT/MRI finding . For PTSD group inclusion , psychiatric diagnosis establish via PTSD Clinical Checklist Military ( PCLM ) Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) . For PTSD/mTBI group inclusion , criterion must meet PTSD mTBI . Control subject OEF/OIF veteran history exposure combat without current previous diagnosis PTSD history TBI . Subjects meet diagnostic criterion drug abuse/dependence past year exclude . Individuals exclude neurological confounds ( e.g. , baseline history CNS opportunistic infection , CNS neoplasm , neurosyphilis , current seizure disorder , demyelinate disease ) , learn disorder , current psychiatric disorder involve psychosis ( schizophrenia , bipolar disorder psychosis ) . Patients also exclude study claustrophobic take cardiovascular medication contraindication fMRI . All 4 subject group match age education .</criteria>
