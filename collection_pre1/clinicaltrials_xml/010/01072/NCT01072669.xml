	<detailed_description>Baseline screening-we screen baseline review history , medication lab value need get blood drawn hemoglobin level , liver function panel blood pregnancy test females child bear age group . Women advise strongly use 2 reliable form contraception study unless tubal ligation intrauterine device placement . You advise stop take medication like nitrate ( like nitroglycerin ) , calcium channel blocker ( like nifedipine amlodipine ) , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( like lisinopril enalapril captopril ) , angiotensin receptor blocker ( like valsartan candesartan ) phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( like Viagra Revatio ) least 1 week prior come first visit study abstain study period unless absolutely necessary . Please avoid caffeine , smoke counter cold remedy least 2 day prior first visit study period . You ask go Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) locate M 51 Cleveland Clinic main campus partake study go back subsequent visit 1 week 12 week start study . This placebo-controlled randomized trial 15 patient get active medication 5 get placebo ( pill active ingredient harmful way ) . This mean 3 4 ( 75 % ) chance get active medication ( ambrisentan ) versus placebo- pill look exactly . This process call `` randomization '' similar flipping coin . The patient get active medication versus placebo randomly select computer ; medication distribute central pharmacy send nurse CRU give first visit CRU . No one know receive active medication versus placebo till study end data analyze . Those get active medicine ambrisentan initially get dose 5mg mouth daily dose increase 10mg mouth daily 4 week medicine well tolerate . This do computer randomization/selection pharmacist drug dispensing . If experience side effect , please contact u advice . You evaluate visit nurse week 0 , 1 12 drug relate problem . We monitor routine schedule blood work result make sure develop drug relate problem detect blood work . A machine call 'Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging ' machine use visit CRU week 0 , 1 12 . This machine use simple laser beam scan top part non-dominant hand ( left hand people ) measure blood flow blood vessel hand room temperature ( around 77 ' F ) cool 50 ' F 2 minute help cold flask . This safe simple technique involve radiation exposure . You also ask fill 3 questionnaire visit ( week 0 , 1 12 ) CRU-these simple question regard degree pain , severity Raynaud 's symptom effect scleroderma day-to-day functioning . Please budget least 1-2 hour initial visit ( week 0 ) CRU 1 hour visit 1 week 12 week CRU .</detailed_description>
