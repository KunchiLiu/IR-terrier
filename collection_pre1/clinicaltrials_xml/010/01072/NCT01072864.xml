	<brief_summary>To determine potential acute cardiovascular benefit California Walnuts postmenopausal woman age 55-70 . Primary outcome measure : - Vascular function - Platelet reactivity We hypothesize consumption California walnuts improve vascular function platelet reactivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects California Walnuts Vascular Function Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study show consumption high amount plant food , nut , fruit vegetable , appear protective chronic disease include heart disease , stroke , diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome . In recent year , numerous study indicate consumption walnut mainly contain α-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , L-arginine polyphenols beneficially alters vascular function reduces inflammatory biomarkers . Recent study report consumption walnut associate beneficial effect prevention chronic diseases favorably alter human serum profile ( i.e . decrease LDL cholesterol triglycerides increase HDL cholesterol apolipoprotein A1 ) closely involved development cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . In addition , recent report Dr. Ros colleague indicate addition walnut high-fat meal improve endothelial function . This favorable influence vasoactivity attribute antioxidant anti-inflammatory property component walnut . Due age menopausal status , postmenopausal woman particular , great risk population develop CVD . Males tend show great rate CVD pre-menopausal woman , woman follow menopause show increase rate CVD . This increase associate endothelial dysfunction decrease vasodilation apparently express menopause become bad age . In study , define effect consume California walnut vascular health . We hypothesize consumption California walnut , particularly rich ALA , L-arginine polyphenols , improve endothelial function platelet reactivity at-risk population postmenopausal woman 50-70 year age .</detailed_description>
