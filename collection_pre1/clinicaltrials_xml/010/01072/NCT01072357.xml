	<brief_summary>The lead risk factor corneal transplant rejection abnormal blood vessel growth host bed . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) think mediator corneal neovascularization ( NV ) , therefore would like test safety efficacy local VEGF blockade promotion graft survival high risk corneal transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Bevacizumab High-Risk Corneal Transplant Survival</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study test effectiveness drug , bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , prevent blood vessel often occur corneal transplantation consider `` high-risk '' rejection . In many case blood vessel lead graft rejection eventual failure corneal transplant . It hop treatment increase chance corneal graft survival . The medication use study call bevacizumab Avastin ( Genentech , Inc ) . It work inhibit action molecule call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF substance molecule bind certain cell stimulate new blood vessel formation . When VEGF bind drug , stimulate formation growth new blood vessel . Growth blood vessel cornea complication worsen prognosis corneal transplant put transplant high risk rejection .</detailed_description>
