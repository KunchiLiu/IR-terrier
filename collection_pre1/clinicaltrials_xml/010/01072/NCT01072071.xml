	<detailed_description>Intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) show cause organ dysfunction mortality different population critically ill patient . According consensus definition publish World Society Abdominal Compartment Syndrome ( WSACS ) , secondary IAH due disease process outside abdominal cavity . It mainly cause massive fluid resuscitation lead bowel abdominal wall edema increase intra-abdominal volume decrease abdominal wall compliance . Large observational study show positive fluid balance independent risk factor mortality . The development secondary IAH may one mechanism involve phenomenon . This lead hypothesis prognosis may improve manage fluid overload aim negative fluid balance soon possible resuscitation phase disease . Several author show case report small series renal replacement therapy ultrafiltration use successfully remove excess fluid lower intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) , renal replacement therapy invasive clinician may reluctant consider therapy patient preserve diuresis kidney function . In effort achieve goal use less invasive technique , new medical management algorithm IAH publish WSACS recommends use judicious diuresis order achieve negative fluid balance decrease IAP . However , kidney especially sensitive deleterious effect IAH may unresponsive diuretic presence IAH . Also , ongoing inflammation capillary leak may lead relative hypovolemia impair response diuretic . We plan multicenter study evaluate influence furosemide fluid balance IAP critically ill patient secondary intra-abdominal hypertension document effect function organ system . The aim study evaluate feasibility safety furosemide administration protocol provide preliminary data allow adequate power calculation .</detailed_description>
