	<brief_summary>Optimal clinical management early stage COPD establish . Tiotropium show improve exercise tolerance ( CWR ) cycle ergometry GOLD stage II IV COPD , improvement constant speed treadmill time study patient also receive pulmonary rehabilitation population patient predominantly severe severe disease ( GOLD stag III IV ) improvements exertional dyspnea , Shuttle Walk Test distance GOLD stage III IV COPD . However , data lack benefit tiotropium exercise tolerance patient early stage COPD symptomatic . Patients milder ventilatory limitation ( GOLD stag I/II COPD patient ) may benefit maintenance therapy limit data exercise limitation patient early stage COPD symptomatic . This study design evaluate mechanism breathlessness assess physical activity limitation early stage COPD patient compare age gender match control secondly investigate effectiveness treatment tiotropium improve dyspnea exercise exercise duration result bronchodilation effect tiotropium lead reduction dynamic hyperinflation Early Stage COPD patient .</brief_summary>
