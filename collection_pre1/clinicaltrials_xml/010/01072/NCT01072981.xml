	<detailed_description>Unfortunately , despite best clinical effort breakthrough biotechnology , patient diagnose pancreatic cancer continue die rapid progression disease . The primary reason disease typically without symptom significant local and/or distant spread occur often beyond chance cure time diagnosis . The lack treatment significantly increase long term survival rate reflect poor outcomes associated disease , specifically time disease progression overall survival . These disappointing fact typically shape discussion treatment option patient disease . However , another important part body look target therapy disease -- immune system . Scientists clearly show pancreatic tumor cell produce number defective protein , express normal proteins highly uncharacteristic way , part cancer . In cancer , abnormality cause immune response cancer cell much way one respond infected tissue . In progressive cancer however , immune system fail identify respond abnormality cancer cell attack destroyed reason yet fully understood . This clinical trial propose new way stimulate immune system recognize abnormal component find pancreatic cancer cell stimulate immune response destroys block growth cancer . This new method treatment help immune system pancreatic cancer patient `` identify '' cancerous tissue eliminate body . As example , people aware patient certain disease may require organ transplant replace damage kidney heart . After receive transplant patient receive special drug great danger immune response destroy `` reject '' transplant organ . This `` rejection '' occur immune system respond difference cell transplant organ immune system attack foreign tissue way would attack infected tissue . When difference foreign tissues patient 's body even large , perhaps like difference organ pig immune system cell human , rejection rapid , highly destructive immunity generates long last . This call hyperacute rejection medicine use immunize patient protocol try harness response teach patient 's immune system fight pancreatic cancer body would learn reject transplant organ animal . To , investigator place mouse gene human pancreatic cancer cell immune system easily recognize foreign , stimulating patient immune system attack vaccine cell would animal cell . As part process destroy immunotherapy cell , patient immune system stimulate identify many difference normal human possible . This extra stimulation think encourage immune response pancreatic cancer patient base share abnormality pancreatic cancer vaccine cell patient 's pancreatic cancer cell . In experimental therapy , patient give injection immunotherapy consist two type cancer cell investigator modify make easily recognize attack immune system . The investigator propose test new treatment patient pancreatic cancer undergone tumor removal surgery remain extremely high risk disease progression demonstrate treatment immunotherapy increase time tumor recurs increase overall survival give combination current standard care therapy disease .
