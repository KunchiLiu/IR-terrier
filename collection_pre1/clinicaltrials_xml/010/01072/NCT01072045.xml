	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Infantile Hemangioma ( IH ) infancy 's common vascular tumor infancy frequent benign neoplasm . In 1996 `` International Society Study Vascular Anomalies '' define guideline diagnosis treatment vascular anomaly . Hemangioma one many vascular tumor classify . Clinically , present well define characteristic natural history divide three phase . The proliferative phase represent initial growth phase hyperplasia hypertrophy , follow spontaneous regression phase call involuting phase . The involuted phase represent final phase biological activity ; however , n't necessarily correspond complete tumor disappearance replacement fibro-fatty tissue . IH affect one every 10 20 Caucasian infants.There predilection females 3:1 5:1 proportion , high incidence premature infant , newborn low birth weight , whose pregnancy present placentary anomaly neonates mother multiple pregnancy . Fifty sixty percent IH affect head neck area . In proliferative phase tumor may reach considerable dimension depend location proximity vital structure , may result obstruction invasion organ . This would cause functional problem even impose threat infant 's life . There variable incidence local complication necrosis , repetitive ulceration , bleed infection , apart systemic complication coagulopathy high output cardiac failure . After involution , IHs may leave scar contour deformity result deformity eventual psychological damage . Treatment IHs indicate approximately 10 20 % case . Two group define amongst indication treatment : patient absolute indication patient relative indication treatment . Absolute emergency indication comprise function life threaten situation obstruction airway , obstruction vision , congestive heart failure , hepatic coagulation problem . The following consider relative indication : case large disfigure facial hemangioma ; location result deformity and/ permanent scar ( nose , ear , lip , glabellar area ) ; extensive face hemangioma , mainly dermal damage ( probable scar ) ; local complication ulceration , infection bleed well small hemangioma expose area ( hand face ) , mainly pedunculated due ease excision . Treatment modality vary accord extension , location , presence complication evolutional phase . A combination various treatment possible . In case relative indication , surgical treatment mostly indicate lesion grow area disfigure potential . For case , pharmacological therapy routine . The mostly use option prednisone , systemic corticosteroid administer orally . The therapeutic response corticosteroid variable effectiveness rate fluctuate 30 84 % . Clearly effective response reduction lesion 's growth rate possible . The effective response , observe , occur average week begin use medication . Side effect frequent , common cushingoid appearance , alteration personality , hypertension , gastrointestinal disorder , decrease growth speed head circumference weight gain . For case response corticosteroid , frequently use drug second treatment line subcutaneous alpha-interferon 2b . In spite effective , medication present higher rate side effect , spastic diplegia fearsome . Other drug use , chemotherapeutic drug immunomodulators . However , publish study cover small casuistics , great population study long term follow justify routine use . Recently , Léauté-Labrèze et al . report use beta blocker ( propanolol ) IH treatment . The casual finding significant reduction hemangioma volume observe drug use antihypertensive treatment side effect result use systemic corticoid treatment infantile hemangioma . A significant reduction tumor volume observe introduction beta blocker , short period time , stable result end treatment , suggest evidence benefit drug tumor treatment . Other author also report successful use medication . Recent initial study show effectiveness isolate use propanolol , suggest presence specific action mechanisms medication . Beta blocker use child approximately 40 year , proven clinical safety case death cardiovascular disease result direct use . Side effect already well establish , bradycardia transitory hypotension , require monitor begin treatment . Besides , beta blocker reduce lipolysis , glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis , predispose hypoglycaemia . It use special attention neonate , present hypoglycaemia without medication . Beta blocker , precisely propanolol , appear one therapeutic option apparent good result . So far literature case report initial protocol use medication . Lesions locate cervicofacial region relative indication treatment susceptible visual exposure , cause discomfort patient family , apart possibility distortion grow anatomical structure eventually evolve deformity . The best management case debatable : one hand possibility pharmacological treatment corticosteroid variable success rate significant side effect ; hand conservative/ expectant treatment , word , wait evolution , expect complete spontaneous regression . Therefore , drug know reduced side effect could good alternative treatment , accelerate tumor involution allow quick problem solution comparison expect conduct conventional pharmacological treatment . In context , proposal ass use propanolol IH treatment , quantify effectiveness safety continuous monitoring comparing use oral corticosteroid . In present study propose assessment betablockers ' use comparison use corticosteroid infant IH proliferative involuting phase , indication clinical treatment , alarm urgent ; word , current relative indication treatment . 2 . Patients Methods Patients go recruited Instituto de Tratamento Câncer Infantil ( Itaci ) - ( Infantile Cancer Treatment Institute ) - ITACI - ICr-HCFMUSP Division Plastic Surgery , Hospital das Clinicas , University Sao Paulo , eligibility , inclusion exclusion criterion assess signature inform consent legally responsible party . 2.1 . Type Study See detailed information 2.2 . Eligibility : Infants age 2 year , gender , carrier clinically diagnose infantile hemangioma proliferative involutive phase relative indication treatment . 2.3 . Inclusion Criteria : see separate item 2.4 . Exclusion Criteria : see separate item 2.5 . Data Gathering Once include study , patient go subject : 2.51 . Gathering epidemiological data concern pregnancy , birth family history ; 2.5.2 . Determination anatomical location dimension hemangioma direct measurement photographic study . - Measures centimeter lesion 's large axis another one perpendicular axis ; - Photographic measure measure tape reference anterior bilateral profile position photo camera obtain technician . 2.5.3 . Pediatric clinical assessment health condition prior begin treatment , comprise follow follow-up parameter : - Blood pressure - Heart rate - Oxygen Saturation - Weight height 2.5.4 . Laboratory assessment - glucose blood level - complete blood count - assessment renal function 2.5.5 . Specific cardiac assessment - rest electrocardiography - echocardiography - PA profile thoracic radiography 2.6 . Clinical Treatment Patients Groups A B undergo treatment initial 60-day period , unless presence criterion medication suspension ( item 2.9 ) . The total length treatment go determine effective response treatment . The effective response go define volumetric reduction lesion . 2.6.1 Outcome Reduction volume go consider effective response . It evaluate base direct measurement photographic analysis , mention item 2.5.2 . The absence effective response initial 60-day period go consider treatment failure ; Group A patient ' medication ( propanolol ) go suspend Group B ( prednisone ) patient go begin progressive dose reduction regimen suspension medication . 2.7 . Follow treatment During whole period treatment patient periodically evaluate described : - Clinical control lesion measure control : - weekly first two month , - twice week following month . Considering parameter obtain item 2.5.2 2.5.3 - Monthly laboratory control end treatment consider parameter obtain item 2.5.4 , - Electrocardiographic examination echocardiography end 60-day initial treatment . 2.8 . Follow conclusion treatment After suspension treatment , patient go maintain periodic outpatient treatment return 14 day , 21 day , 1 , 2 6 month evaluation clinical parameter lesion dimension . Six ( 6 ) month conclusion treatment , electrocardiography , echocardiography chest radiography go repeat . 2.9 . Criteria treatment interruption : In event indication suspension treatment , patient go exclude study go follow treatment accord group 's routine indication . 2.9.1 . Group A - Propranolol : - Hypotension percentile 90 - Bradycardia heart rate percentile 90 - Bronchospasm - electrocardiographic alteration - echocardiographic alteration - hypoglycaemia . 2.9.2 . Group B - Prednisone - Difficult-to-control hypertension</detailed_description>
