	<detailed_description>During Part A , cohort subject receive single dose GSK2118436 alone ( Day 1 ) repeat dos GSK1120212 ( Day 2 Day 15 ) . The dose regimen GSK1120212 continuous dosing . A second single dose GSK2118436 administer Day 15 concomitantly GSK1120212 . Day 16 Day 28 washout period , study medication administer . Starting Day 29 , subject elect continue participation study dose GSK2118436 . The dose GSK2118436 Day 29 may alter base emerge data first-time-in human study BRF112680 . The dose may increase dose level complete determine less equal maximum tolerate dose study . Part B study enroll cohort escalate dos identify set allowable dos expand Part C. Subjects enrol 3+3 cohort design , provisional dose level drug . The decision regard escalation next dose level GSK1120212 GSK2118436 guide Bayesian logistic regression model . The first cohort start low dos drug . Doses 300 mg/day GSK2118436 3 mg QD GSK1120212 study date . The start dose may lower base emerge data study Part A . Expansion cohort enrol Part C dose level GSK2118436 GSK1120212 define Part B . One select dos may include GSK2118436 administered monotherapy tolerable dose ( less equal maximum tolerate dose ) determine BRF112680 . Part C randomize open-label Phase II portion study , consist expansion cohort investigate 2 3 dose level GSK2118436 GSK1120212 dose combination , GSK2118436 administer monotherapy . Subjects assign treatment arm randomize fashion compare tolerability safety . Population PK parameter , clinical activity , durability response safety GSK2118436 GSK1120212 dose orally combination GSK2118436 monotherapy evaluate . Part D consist evaluation pharmacokinetics GSK2118436 HPMC capsule administer monotherapy combination GSK1120212 . Pharmacokinetics GSK2118436 assess follow single dose Day 1 repeat dosing ( Day 21 ) compare combination monotherapy . The pharmacokinetics GSK1120212 also assess . Safety , tolerability clinical activity also evaluate 4 dosing cohort . These cohort may expand additional safety data . Subjects randomize different cohort .</detailed_description>
