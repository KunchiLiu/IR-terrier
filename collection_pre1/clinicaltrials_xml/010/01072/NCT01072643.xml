	<detailed_description>Clinical dose escalation drug trial evaluate effect 3 different dos dexmedetomidine pulmonary vascular bed pediatric subject elevate pulmonary vascular resistance . The study conduct 2 part , pilot phase incorporate stop rule optimize safety drug population . Study subject include pediatric subject Pulmonary Hypertension ( PHTN ) . Part 1 : This dose escalation phase study . Twenty four evaluable subject enrol . Subjects include pediatric subject pulmonary hypertension ( PVR &gt; 4WU ) undergo hemodynamic cardiac catheterization vasoreactivity drug test . Cohorts 8 evaluable subject receive dose level 1 , dose level 2 , dose level 3 Dexmedetomidine . The dose escalate next dose DEX subject enrol precede DEX dose cohort , safety establish level . Inadequate sedation despite high dose DEX level consider treatment failure intention treat basis . Part 2 : This part study conduct pilot phase safely complete , full complement subject recruit .</detailed_description>
