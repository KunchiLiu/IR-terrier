	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib , cyclophosphamide , dexamethasone together work treat patient primary systemic light chain amyloidosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib , Cyclophosphamide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To assess confirmed hematologic response rate combination bortezomib , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone patient primary systemic amyloidosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Organ response rate bortezomib , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone combination . II . Severity frequency adverse event associate bortezomib , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone treatment patient primary systemic amyloidosis . III . Time progression . IV . Survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 8 , 15 oral cyclophosphamide oral dexamethasone daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
