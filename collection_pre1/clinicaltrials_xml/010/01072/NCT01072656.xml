	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety efficacy Deep Brian Stimulation ( DBS ) ventral capsular/ventral striatal treatment patient Thalamic Pain Syndrome ( TPS ) . The central hypothesis test investigation VC/VS stimulation modulate affective component TPS , consequently , improve pain related disability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Deep Brain Stimulation Manage Thalamic Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot clinical study therapeutic benefit ventral capsular/ventral striatal deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment 10 patient medically refractory thalamic pain syndrome . Patients enrol protocol experience severe pain six month consider medically refractory . Study subject may undergo fail surgical procedure interventional procedure . Study subject chronic , medically refractory pain disable severity , refractory treatment attempt conventional medication . Patients enrol study bilateral DBS surgery , implantation one Medtronic 3391 DBS lead either side brain . These lead connect first single Medtronic PC pulse generator implant infraclavicular region one side . Once PC pulse generator deplete , patient complete blinded phase study , PC pulse generator replace RC pulse generator . The RC pulse generator battery life 9 year good option open label phase continue stimulation study complete . However , RC ideal blind phase patient may able tell receive active sham stimulation . For reason , patient enrol study receive , initially , implant PC generator . Patients least 6 month stable chronic pain associate TPS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis thalamic pain syndrome allodynia dysesthesia pinprick anesthesia hypoesthesia affect hemibody ( anesthesia dolorosa ) . Six month medically refractory severe pain ( see ) . Pain disability report pain index &gt; 30 point time enrollment . Average daily pain past 30 day report &gt; 5 010 scale Failure respond adequately least one antidepressant , one antiseizure medication one oral narcotic . MRI do within one year first visit show lesion involve posterior thalamic region lesion dorsal ventral vicinity thalamus ( i.e . semi oval white matter brain stem ) . The lesion contralateral hemibody affect chronic pain involve corticalsubcortical area topography consistent sensory thalamocortical connection . This include patient infarcts territory middle cerebral artery . A recent MRI may require patient 's condition change within previous year . Capable understand provide informed consent Age â‰¥ 21 year Women childbearing age must regular use accepted contraceptive method ( ) . Previous surgical procedure : Patients severe refractory thalamic pain syndrome may undergo interventional surgical procedure , attempt alleviate thalamic pain syndrome . Surgical procedure may include block , spinal cord stimulation , thalamic DBS , posterior limb internal capsule DBS periaqueductal gray / periventricular gray DBS , cortical stimulation , peripheral ablative procedure cerebral ablative procedure . In study , patient previously implant cortical stimulation system , spinal peripheral nervous system stimulation system may include . However , patient previous motor cortex stimulation must cortical stimulation system consider candidate protocol . Removal cortical stimulation system cover protocol . Patients spinal peripheral neuromodulation system may include research provide implanted system compatible research protocol ( include fMRI ) perform research . Patients pervious DBS implant consider candidate . Not capable understand provide informed consent . Aphasia severe enough limit consent process communication investigator patient . Patients mild recover aphasia may consider candidate discretion PI . Coagulopathy . Patients exclude unless assess cleared hematology Inability stop Coumadin platelet antiaggregation therapy surgery surgery . Patients take medication need discuss need/risk continue medication physician PI study personnel may contact treat physician ( ) well discuss risk anticoagulation / antiaggregation therapy discontinuation . Uncontrolled hypertension . Malignancy &lt; 5 year life expectancy . Major medical comorbidities : end stage renal failure , heart failure , severe congestive heart disease , severe respiratory problem , liver failure significant medical co morbidity . Major neurological disorder one lead TPS . MRI ( do within one year first visit ) abnormality associate neurological disorder cause TPS . Age &lt; 21 year . Pregnancy lack regular use contraceptive . Patients become pregnant enrollment may exclude study . Patients become pregnant prior surgical implantation DBS system exclude study . Previous ablative intracranial surgery management TPS . Previously implanted deep brain stimulation system . Concurrent enrolment trial / study TPS . Implantable hardware compatible MRI study . Patients may exclude enrollment due condition , judgment PI , significantly increase risk reduces significantly likelihood benefit VC/VS DBS . Untreated / uncontrolled ( severe time enrolment ) depression psychiatric disorder . Bipolar disorder , current PTSD , severe personality disorder , active psychosis , Severe OCD . Psychological comorbidities indicate high risk patient / high risk failure . Suicide attempt &lt; /= 12 month Communication plan suicide , prior implant , study treatment fail Imminent suicide risk</criteria>
