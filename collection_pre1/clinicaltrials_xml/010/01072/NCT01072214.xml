	<brief_summary>A study determine safety tolerability pazopanib eye drop . The study also determine drug absorb metabolized time . Repeat dose eye drop administer healthy adult volunteer 14-day period one additional dose give 15th day session . Three group subject may receive either active drug placebo ( drop without drug ) . The first group subject receive maximum 1.6mg pazopanib placebo . The dose drug give next two group determine base result first group subject . The last group subject Japanese descent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study characterize ocular safety tolerability , systemic safety tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile repeat dose high strength ophthalmic formulation pazopanib , 10 mg/mL . The high strength formulation provide opportunity increase total daily dose pazopanib administer . In 3-cohort study , healthy adult volunteer participate one 14-day repeat-dose session ( plus single dose day 15 ) , randomize receive either pazopanib eye drop placebo . Subjects cohort 1 receive 1 drop four time daily calculate total daily dose 1.6 mg . The dosage regimen two subsequent cohort determine base emerge safety profile . The Japanese population choose third cohort provide safety tolerability profile well pharmacokinetic profile pazopanib prior development formulation Japanese patient AMD .</detailed_description>
