	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part ( A &amp; B ) single center Mexico . The purpose Part A evaluate safety H1N1 VLP vaccine evaluate immunogenicity select dose Part B . In Part A , 1,000 subject enrol randomized 1:1:1:1 schedule ( 5µg , 15µg 45µg dos H1N1 VLP vaccine placebo . Subjects receive two intramuscular ( IM ) injection ( 0.5mL/dose ) H1N1 VLP vaccine placebo 21 day apart . Blood HAI assay collect 3 time point ( baseline , Day 14 Day 36 ) . Subjects followed adverse event ( AEs ) first day study 21 day second dose ( Day 36 ) . Subjects follow serious AEs significant new medical condition ( SNMCs ) end study 6 month post-dose 2 ( Day 194 ) . Once first 500 subject enrol Part A , enrollment halt 3 day safety follow-up data review study Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . A second data review occur follow Day 14 visit Part A select dose administer Part B . Part B study conduct evaluate safety accumulate enough safety data potentially move forward broad use vaccine assume favorable result . In Part B , total 3,250 - 3,750 subject randomize receive select dose H1N1 VLP vaccine placebo . A total 3,000 H1N1 VLP vaccine recipient select dose high , 1,250 placebo recipient enrol Parts A B . Following completion Day 36 Part A , data may review assess 1 injection vs. 2 injection Part B .</detailed_description>
