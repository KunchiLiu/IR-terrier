	<detailed_description>The elastometry method prove efficient evaluation liver fibrosis adult . But inter-costal space thin child , adult probe could use . Recently special probe adapt child TECHNICATED . We want test specific probe child . Five French Paediatrics centre participate study . We need 200 child inclusion 2 year statistically power analysis . Inclusion child order need liver biopsy . Each child include elastometry measure time liver biopsy . The fibrosis stag trained pathologist score METAVIR score witch reference . The elastometry measure realise physician 3 sequential measure child . The statistical analysis perform statistician . If elastometry prove efficient method evaluate liver fibrosis child , numerous liver biopsy could avoid . Because elastometry non invasive method could also use follow-up different category child need sequential liver biopsy .</detailed_description>
