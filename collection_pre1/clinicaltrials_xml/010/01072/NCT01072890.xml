	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety temsirolimus pazopanib different dos . Patients advance cancer felt benefit standard treatment longer respond treatment ask take part study . The study hypothesis temsirolimus pazopanib administer safely combination combine target mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) signal pathway effective treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite encouraging clinical activity report single-agent VEGF inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor , novel agent , patient rarely achieve complete disease response ultimately undergo disease progression . The limited efficacy single-target inhibition may due numerous , overlap signal pathway involve Renal Cell Carcinoma proliferation growth . A strategy multi-target `` vertical inhibition '' overlap aberrant VEGF mTOR pathway combination therapy may translate enhanced efficacy single agent alone . We hypothesize temsirolimus pazopanib administer safely combination combine target mTOR VEGFR signal pathway effective treat patient advance solid tumor .</detailed_description>
