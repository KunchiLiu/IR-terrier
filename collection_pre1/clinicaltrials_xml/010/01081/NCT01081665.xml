	<brief_title>Follow-up Patients With End Stage Renal Disease Receiving Zemplar Prevent Treat Secondary Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate safety Zemplar® treatment Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( iParathormone &gt; 300 pg/mL ) subject hemodialysis treat condition usual clinical care . The primary safety endpoint study evaluate safety Zemplar record number hospitalization day hospitalize . A secondary efficacy endpoint proportion subject achieve therapeutic success . Therapeutic success Zemplar® define : - 40 % reduction base iPTH level achieve , and/or ; - serum iParathormone level &lt; 300 pg/mL . Additional secondary endpoint incidence ( proportion patient ) clinically meaningful hypercalcemia ( define correct serum calcium ( Ca ) &gt; 11.0 mg/dL take 2 consecutive measurement ) , hyperphosphatemia ( define serum phosphorous ( P ) &gt; 6.5 mg/dL take 2 consecutive measurement ) , elevate Ca x P product ( defined serum Ca x P &gt; 65 mg^2/dL^2 take 2 consecutive measurement ) . Safety also assess adverse event monitoring evaluation laboratory variable vital sign .</detailed_description>
