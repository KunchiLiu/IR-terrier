	<brief_summary>In develop country 50 % child become anemic 12 month age ( 1 . Iron deficiency anemia major risk factor neonatal infantile mortality morbidity Pakistan . It detrimental effect neurodevelopment infant may irreversible even iron therapy ( 2 ) . Type cost effective intervention perinatal period prevention anemia later infancy limit . Delayed cord clamp beneficial effect prevention anemia later infancy increase iron store birth ( 3 . However controversy incorporate delay cord clamp practice management third stage labour globally ( 4 ) Paucity national guideline lack substantial data Pakistan topic strongly necessitate study trial . This study may contribute develop protocol timing cord clamp cost effective prevention iron deficiency anemia investigator infantile population . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial investigator hypothesis delay cord clamp result high hemoglobin ( Hb ) , hematocrit ( Hct ) ferritin third month compare early cord clamping . OBJECTIVES : A- Primary : 1 . To study effect time umbilical cord clamp hemoglobin ( Hb ) , Hematocrit ( Hct ) birth , 48 hour Hb , Hct ferritin three month age . 2 . To study effect time umbilical cord clamp short term clinical profile neonate like jaundice , respiratory distress , anemia , polycythemia etc . fist 24 48 hour life . B- Secondary : To assess whether delayed cord clamp associate undesirable effect mother follow till 48 hour postpartum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Timing Umbilical Cord Clamping Haematological Clinical Outcomes Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delayed umbilical cord clamping ( DCC ) result approximately 30-40 ml additional placental blood volume transfusion neonate 30-35 mg increase iron store birth ( 5 ) .The neonatal benefit include high hematocrit ( Hct ) , high red blood cell flow vital organ , good cardiopulmonary adaptation , additional iron store less anemia later infancy ( 6 ) .It evident different study adverse effect DCC notice mother well neonate ( 7 ) . The beneficial effect delay cord clamp observed term infant positive impact preterm small gestational age ( SGA ) infant . The requirement pack cell transfusion first six month significantly reduce noticed different study ( 8 ) .It also associate low risk intraventricular hemorrhage late onset sepsis preterm infant ( 9 ) . The practice early cord clamping ( ECC ) commonly follow maternity unit . It believe reduces risk post partum haemorrhage ( PPH ) duration third stage labour . But time provide benefit neonate ( 4 ) .Conversely increase possibility fetomaternal transfusion , hypovolemic damage , neonatal anemia , respiratory distress syndrome type 2 diabetes later life ( 5 ) .The risk iso immunization rhesus negative mother also increase ECC ( 10 ) .</detailed_description>
