	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study carboplatin give together paclitaxel without bevacizumab see well work compare oxaliplatin give together capecitabine without bevacizumab first-line therapy treat patient newly diagnose stage II-IV , recurrent ( come back ) stage I epithelial ovarian fallopian tube cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel , oxaliplatin , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . It yet know regimen combination chemotherapy give together without bevacizumab effective treat epithelial ovarian cancer fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel Oxaliplatin Capecitabine With Without Bevacizumab First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Recurrent Stage I Epithelial Ovarian Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine capecitabine oxaliplatin reduce death rate compare carboplatin paclitaxel woman mucinous adenocarcinoma ovary fallopian tube . II . To determine bevacizumab reduces death rate compare bevacizumab woman mucinous adenocarcinoma ovary fallopian tube . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine capecitabine oxaliplatin increase duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare carboplatin paclitaxel woman mucinous adenocarcinoma ovary fallopian tube . II . To determine bevacizumab increase duration PFS compare bevacizumab woman mucinous adenocarcinoma ovary fallopian tube . III . To compare response rate capecitabine oxaliplatin versus carboplatin paclitaxel patient mucinous adenocarcinoma ovary fallopian tube measurable disease initial tumor reductive surgery . IV . To compare response rate bevacizumab versus bevacizumab patient mucinous adenocarcinoma ovary fallopian tube measurable disease initial tumor reductive surgery . V. To determine nature degree toxicity capecitabine oxaliplatin compare carboplatin paclitaxel cohort patient . VI . To determine nature degree toxicity bevacizumab cohort patient . VII . To compare capecitabine oxaliplatin versus carboplatin paclitaxel respect change patient report neurotoxicity . VIII . To determine impact quality life ( QOL , measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Ovarian [ FACT-O ] Trial Outcome Index [ TOI ] ) follow treatment regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect fixed and/or frozen tissue whole blood future research study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2-6 hour day 1 capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive carboplatin paclitaxel IV arm I bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute alone day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IV : Patients receive oxaliplatin capecitabine arm II , bevacizumab arm III . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
