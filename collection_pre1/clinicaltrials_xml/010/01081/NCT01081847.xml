	<brief_summary>This phase I double blind control vaccine trial , evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity mixtures N , R C LSP derive P. vivax CS protein formulate two adjuvant Montanide ISA 720 Montanide ISA 51 . The primary objective ass malaria-naïve adult , safety reactogenicity peptide formulate two adjuvant We recruit 40 healthy men woman volunteer Cali , Colombia , city non-endemic malaria . Volunteers 19 -- 41 year age history malaria . During period three month total 100 volunteer assess eligibility criterion order select total 40 volunteer willing participate clinical trial . By consecutive allocation , eight participant allocate five experimental group ( A -- E ) : four group ( A -- D ) immunize vaccine formulation two different dose concentration formulate two different adjuvant . A control group ( E ) inject placebo ( saline solution )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Study Plasmodium Vivax CS Derived Synthetic Peptides Formulated Two Adjuvants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study correspond clinical trial , randomize double-blind , control , dose escalation , Phase IB , assess safety immunogenicity mixture synthetic peptide derive CS protein P. vivax , formulate adjuvant Montanide ISA 720 51 ; healthy men nonpregnant woman without previous history malaria infection . In order optimize vaccine dose , eligible participant enrol receive three dos vaccine contain peptide mixture dose 50 ug 100 ug individual peptide , final dose 150 ug 300 ug respectively , volume 0.5 mL . The previous clinical trial indicate dos 30 ug 100 ug produce well response low dos . The first immunization dose ( give Month 0 ) contain peptide N C , whereas two boost dos ( give Months 2 4 ) contain three ( N , R , C ) peptide ( Table 1 ) . Vaccination perform intramuscular injection deltoid muscle , alternate arm injection . For safety reason , participant assign low vaccine dose group immunize first two week initiation serious adverse event ( SAE ) occur , immunization participant high-dose start . Half participant assign receive placebo immunize along dose level group . Clinical monitor IRBs University Valle IMC , evaluate occurrence severity adverse event ( AE ) associate immunization . The occurrence three AE ( severity grade 2 high ) one SAE related vaccine would lead study termination . Participants leave study replace .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adult ( male nonpregnant female ) 18 45 year old , without previously malaria infection ( naïve volunteer ) , capable pas comprehension test study able provide write informed consent participate trial . Use adequate contraceptive method since initiation study two month end study . No plan travel malaria endemic area course study . Reachable phone study period ( 1 year ) . No use vaccine since 3 month begin study . Females intend become pregnant within 3 month follow screen visit pregnant screening time , ascertain urine serum pregnancy test ( BHCG ) . Women breastfeed also exclude . Reason exclusion : The immunological change accompany pregnancy lactation could alter result assay perform . If pathological condition appear , could carry vaccine . Duffy negative phenotype . Justification : Individuals phenotype refractory P. vivax infection . G6PD deficiency genetic defect ( hemoglobinopathy ) . Justification : These condition influence development P. vivax infection . History previous experimental malaria vaccination . Justification : Individuals previously immunize may show response due past immunization present one . Clinical laboratory evidence significant systemic disease , include hepatic , renal , cardiac , immunologic hematological disease . Justification : The result study could negative impact study volunteer suffer disease . Evidence active hepatitis B C HIV infection . Justification : Serious underlie medical condition could affect immunological response volunteer could increase risk severity adverse event associate participation study . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality determine investigator ( ) . Justification : Baseline abnormal laboratory value may indicate serious underlie medical condition also make difficult evaluate AE´s conduct study . • Known history autoimmune ( include inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus ) connective tissue disease . Justification : Autoimmune disease could affect immunological response volunteer could increase risk volunteer . • Individuals receive treatment steroid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug immunosuppressive therapy . Justification : These drug could affect immunological response volunteer could increase risk volunteer . Known history drug alcohol abuse interfere normal social function . Justification : Pharmacodependency alters capacity free decision produce physical psychiatric undesirable condition could affect study . Volunteers unable give write informed consent difficulty understand study . Justification : Volunteers must capacity provide informed consent order participate research involve human</criteria>
