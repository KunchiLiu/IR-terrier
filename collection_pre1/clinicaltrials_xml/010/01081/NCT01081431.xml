	<brief_title>Safety Lenalidomide Markers Disease Progression Patients With International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) Low- Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) With Isolated del5q</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide successfully use patient MDS several study . A small proportion patient MDS del ( 5q ) develop leukemia treat Lenalidomide . Up unknown patient risk progress treat Lenalidomid . Therefore plan examine traditional clinical parameter like disease status proportion blast , also cytogenetic finding , gene expression , antiangiogenic effect , marrow fibrosis , mesenchymal stem cell well mitochondrial DNA mutation baseline course study perform central laboratory . Moreover , long-term data require , e.g. , regard development AML . Therefore , plan collect data patient MDS del 5q ( isolate , blast count &lt; 5 % ) treatment lenalidomide best therapeutic option accord investigator 's assessment structure fashion .</detailed_description>

Transfusion dependency least 1 concentrate erythrocyte within 8 week prior first administration study drug . Start treatment lenalidomide best therapeutic option patient accord investigator 's assessment There apart individual case erythropoetin level lower 500 U/l allogeneic transplantation young patient authorized alternative treatment option . Chemotherapy low dose cytosine arabinoside may result hematologic improvement . However , concern riskbenefitassessment chemotherapy unfavorable lenalidomide due cytopenia mutagenic effect . Female subject childbearing potential must : Understand study medication teratogenic risk Agree use , able comply , effective contraception without interruption , 4 week start study drug , throughout study drug therapy ( include dose interruption ) 4 week end study drug therapy , even amenorrhoea .

This requirement also apply woman childbearing potential practice complete continue abstinence ( * ) Combined oral contraceptive pill recommend . If subject use combined oral contraception , must switch one method . The increase risk VTE continue 4 6 week stop combined oral contraception . ( ** ) Prophylactic antibiotic consider time insertion particularly patient neutropenia due risk infection Male subject must Agree use condom throughout study drug therapy , dose interruption one week cessation study therapy partner childbearing potential contraception . Agree donate semen study drug therapy one week end study drug therapy . All subject must Agree abstain donate blood take study drug therapy one week follow discontinuation study drug therapy .
