	<brief_title>Prevention Relapse With Injectable Paliperidone Palmitate Versus Oral Antipsychotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , open-label ( physician patient know name assign drug ) , rater-blinded ( person assess condition patient know name assign drug ) , active-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter , prospective international study paliperidone palmitate versus treatment usual oral antipsychotic agent monotherapy prevention relapse ( return symptom ) . Patients recently diagnose schizophrenia ( within 5 year ) suffer schizophrenic relapse ( return symptom schizophrenia ) enrol . This study consist 2-week initial acute oral treatment phase , follow treatment phase ( core phase ) relapse maximally 24 month , whichever come first . Prior 2-week oral treatment phase , patient randomly ( chance ) assign 1:1 ratio receive treatment paliperidone palmitate injection ( once-monthly ) oral antipsychotic medication ( daily ) . Patients randomize paliperidone palmitate first receive oral paliperidone ER daily 2 week follow paliperidone palmitate injection dose 150 mg eq . Day 1 , 100 mg eq . Day 8 deltoid muscle 75 mg eq . Day 38 dos dose range 25 150 mg eq . either deltoid gluteal muscle thereafter . Patients randomized oral comparator arm receive oral antipsychotic ( haloperidol , paliperidone ER , risperidone , olanzapine , quetiapine aripiprazole ) per investigator discretion prescribe accord label . Total treatment duration maximally 24 month . During 24 month treatment phase , investigator allow flexibly decrease increase dose paliperidone palmitate one dose level range 25 150 mg eq . oral antipsychotic respective locally approve dose range , accord patient 's clinical need . The primary endpoint 24-month treatment phase time relapse . Safety monitor evaluate Adverse Events ( AEs ) , rating extrapyramidal symptom ( symptom like abnormal muscle movement , abnormal movement tongue jaw , slow sustain muscle contraction , muscle spasm , shake , abnormal movement eye , involuntary muscle contraction , slow movement , restlessness ) , vital sign measurement ( include heart rate blood pressure ) , body weight physical examination finding . A urine pregnancy test perform female childbearing potential . Adverse event ( unintended , necessarily unexpected , result therapy unpleasant dangerous ) , associate concomitant medication , symptom relapse record need .</detailed_description>
