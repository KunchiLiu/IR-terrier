	<brief_summary>This open-label , prospective , randomize , control , multicentric , multinational , phase IV study evaluate use Gonal-f induce ovulation female subject chronic anovulation . It observe conventional high dose set regimen gonadotropin human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) effective anovulatory subject term overall pregnancy rate . However , development multiple follicle lead multiple pregnancy and/or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) major complication associate high dose set . Chronic low-dose ( CLD ) protocols follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , aim find threshold amount FSH necessary promote monofolliculogenesis , find successful reduce rate OHSS almost nil rate multiple pregnancy minimum . This post-marketing study investigate tailor recombinant follicle stimulate hormone ( r-FSH ) large population ( N=310 ) subject region ( North Africa/Middle East ) include previous study ovulation induction subject chronic anovulation . The study aim increase current knowledge efficacy safety Gonal-f , provide fertility physician experience Gonal-f treatment anovulatory infertility , thereby contribute development FSH dose guideline ovulation induction define optimal CLD Low dose ( LD ) regimens .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gonal-f recombinant form human FSH ( r-hFSH ) , endogenous gonadotropin produce genetically engineer chinese hamster ovary cell indicate induction ovulation pregnancy anovulatory infertile woman cause infertility functional due primary ovarian failure . It also indicate development multiple follicle ovulatory woman participate assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) programme , vitro fertilization ( IVF ) . The primary cause infertility woman abnormality ovulation . Most anovulatory subject fall World Health Organization ( WHO ) Group II category , characterize asynchronous gonadotropin oestrogen production normal level prolactin ( PRL ) . These subject present variety menstrual disorder , commonly polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) . Gonal-f administered course daily injection , subcutaneously anterior abdominal wall . A commonly use regimen commences 75-150 IU FSH daily increase preferably 37.5 IU , 75 IU 7 preferably 14 day interval necessary , obtain adequate excessive response . A single injection 5,000 IU urinary hCG ( u-hCG ) ( 250 microgram [ mcg ] r-hCG ) administer last dose Gonal-f lead follicle reach 17 mm diameter . The subject later recommend coitus day , day follow , hCG administration . The efficacy Gonal-f treatment WHO Group II anovulatory infertile woman confirm 2 randomize , open-label , multicentric , phase III non-inferiority study compare Gonal-f Metrodin® ( urinary FSH ) ovulation induction . The possible serious adverse event ( SAEs ) associate Gonal-f include OHSS possible complication , multiple pregnancy , pregnancy wastage , ectopic pregnancy possible risk ovarian cancer reproductive system neoplasm ( e.g . endometrial , breast carcinoma ) . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To investigate tailor recombinant FSH treatment subject chronic anovulation Secondary objective : - To evaluate commonly use ovulation induction regimens treatment - To establish local experience Gonal-f pen investigate ease use The study enroll 310 eligible subject , randomize 1:1 ratio either Group I II baseline visit prior first dose FSH ( pre-stimulation ) . Each subject refrain use gonadotropin ovulation stimulation therapy period screen start stimulation treatment . During stimulation period , Gonal-f administer course daily ( OD ) injection , s.c. anterior abdominal wall Gonal-f pen , accord either one follow 2 step-up , low-dose regimen : Group I : CLD regimen recommend start dose 75 IU first adjustment Day 14 stimulation , ovarian response observe . Group II : LD regimen recommend start dose 75 IU first adjustment Day 7 stimulation , ovarian response observe . For group , least 1 follicle reach 10 12 mm diameter , Gonal-f administration maintain dose leading follicle reach 17 mm diameter 2 follicle reach 14 mm diameter . A single injection hCG ( 5,000 IU u-hCG 250 mcg r-hCG ) administer intramuscularly subcutaneously last Gonal-f injection , trigger ovulation . Subjects also advise coitus day , day follow hCG administration . The total length stimulation treatment exceed 35 day unless ultrasound assessment suggest imminent follicular growth maturation subject undergo one cycle stimulation treatment . Subjects also follow post stimulation period 20 day trigger ovulation hCG injection , cancellation cycle .</detailed_description>
