	<brief_title>A Study Using Recombinant Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin ( rhCG , Ovidrel® ) Induction Final Follicle Maturation Early Luteinization Chinese Women Undergoing Vitro Fertilization Embryo Transfer ( IVF/ET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open , randomize , comparative multicentric , phase III study evaluate safety efficacy rhCG comparison urinary hCG induction final follicle maturation early luteinization 200 Chinese female subject undergoing superovulation . The study organize outpatient basis subject undergo assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) . All subject underwent pituitary down- regulation per center 's normal practice prior stimulation multiple follicular development . The subject randomize 2 group . One group receive rhCG 250mcg group receive urinary hCG ( Profasi® ) 10,000IU . Each subject group receive single injection hCG follicular development judge adequate . Oocytes retrieve 36-38 hour hCG injection fertilize vitro . Not 3 embryos 2 blastocyst replace . Progesterone administer daily accord center 's normal practice , start oocyte pick continue negative pregnancy test first 3 week pregnancy subject pregnant . The subject follow treatment outcome ( negative pregnancy test pregnancy ) record . A phase I sub-study evaluate pharmacokinetics single subcutaneous ( s.c. ) administration rhCG conduct 24 healthy Chinese female subject China . The subject randomize 3 group . Each group receive single dose 250mcg 500mcg 750 mcg rhCG . Blood sample collect predetermined interval injection . Human chorionic gonadotropin serum level measure Serono MAIAclone vitro bioassay MA-10 . Safety assess incidence severity adverse event ( AEs ) , include multiple pregnancy ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) significant change laboratory value .</detailed_description>
