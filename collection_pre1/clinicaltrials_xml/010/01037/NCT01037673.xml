	<brief_summary>Objective : A randomized clinical trial order evaluate efficacy structure eccentric exercise tutor physical therapist ( PT ) patient subacromial impingement . Hypothesis : H1 The exercise satisfactory effect need arthroscopic subacromial decompression reconsider . H0 No difference two exercise ( experimental active control ) patient still need surgery Further study objective evaluate predictor positive negative treatment response three month rehabilitation well 12 month . Method : Patients refer orthopedic unit arthroscopic subacromial decompression , offer three month rehabilitation program waiting time surgery approximately 4-6 month . All patient must try conservative treatment least 6 month primary care unsatisfactory result . The patient randomize either structure eccentric exercise tutor physical therapist control exercise general movement neck shoulder . All patient equal number session PT offer similar attention . After three month follow key-question answer : due current experience shoulder problem still need surgical intervention ? A blinded orthopedic surgeon evaluate follow outcome baseline three twelve month . Primary outcome : Constant-Murley shoulder assessment , Disabilities Arm Shoulder Hans different aspect pain . Secondary outcome ; EQ-5D , sick-leave return work . All patient evaluate diagnostic ultrasound order reveal condition rotator cuff . Also long-term result go thorough surgery decline assess 12 month . Importance study result : Since consensus intervention prefer patient subacromial impingement result current study warrant . If exercise program successful implement clinical practice . Further , clinical characteristic patient really need arthroscopic subacromial decompression identify .</brief_summary>
