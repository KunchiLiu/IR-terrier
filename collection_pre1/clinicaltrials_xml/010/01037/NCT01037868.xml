Similarly , program conduct among youth type 1 diabetes ( 16 ) , daily text message helpful disease self-management , increased self-efficacy , treatment adherence achieve high satisfaction among participant .

There also establish research evidence use SMS remind patient schedule medical appointment , ( 18,19,20,21 , 22 ) coordinate medical staff , ( 23 ) deliver medical test result , ( 24,25,26 ) monitor patient side effect follow treatment ( 27 ) . To date , extensive review literature use MEDLINE , Pub Med , ERIC , Web Science , Science Direct PsycINFO , study find use daily text message deliver via mobile phone intervention address abstinence amongst alcohol dependent subject co-morbid depressive disorder . Thus , seek determine text message useful effective strategy help maintain abstinence , improve adherence medication ultimately promote mental stability depress patient discharge in-patient dual diagnosis programme . We hypothesize , daily supportive/reminder SMS text message depress patient discharge in-patient dual diagnosis programme would increase alcohol abstinence rate , improve medication adherence rate improve overall mental well patient compare receive treatment usual . Patients receive text message phone call would also report favourable experience overall satisfaction system .</detailed_description>
