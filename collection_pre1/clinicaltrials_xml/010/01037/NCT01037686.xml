	<brief_summary>The goal study explore effect subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) -DBS surgery stimulation PD ( Parkinson 's disease ) patient regional cerebral blood ( CBF ) flow cognitive task performance rest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Electrode Implantation Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Brain Function Using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) With Technetium-99m-ethyl Cysteinatedimer ( Tc-ECD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study subject undergo SPECT scan CBF mapping . PD patient surgery healthy control undergo two scan . PD patient surgery undergo four scan . PD patient undergo two scan surgery , undergo two scan surgery . Uptake Tc-ECD , CBF radiotracer , do follow condition : - For PD patient surgery - performance semantic verbal fluency task rest ( total 2 scan ) . - For PD patient surgery- performance semantic verbal fluency task rest , either on-stimulation off-stimulation condition ( total 4 scan ) . The stimulator turn neurologist 10 min . - PD patient surgery- performance semantic verbal fluency task rest surgery performance semantic verbal fluency task rest surgery off-stimulation condition ( Total 4 scan ) . - Healthy control - performance semantic verbal fluency task rest ( total 2 scan ) . Following Tc-ECD injection , subject scan Irix SPECT camera 15min . Scans analyzed regional CBF measure use image software . Statistical analysis do discover effect surgery , stimulation disease blood flow rest task performance . In addition , difference group number word produce task also statistically analyze .</detailed_description>
