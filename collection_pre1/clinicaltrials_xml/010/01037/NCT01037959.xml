	<brief_title>Norfloxacin Therapy Patients With Cirrhosis Severe Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intestinal translocation Gram-negative bacteria occur patient advanced cirrhosis . Long-term oral administration 400 mg/day norfloxacin ( fluoroquinolone antibiotic ) know induce selective intestinal decontamination Gram-negative bacteria . A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial oral norfloxacin ( 400 mg/day 1 year ) conduct small series patient advanced cirrhosis low ascitic fluid protein concentration &lt; 1.5 g/dL . This trial show norfloxacin therapy significantly increase 1-year probability free first episode spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) improve 3-month survival . In previous study , oral norfloxacin therapy also find decrease risk development hepatorenal syndrome , severe complication cirrhosis . It suggest bacterial translocation , release bacterial byproduct , result systemic inflammation subsequent systemic vasodilation precipitate hepatorenal syndrome . Since systemic vasodilation play role development ascites , bacterial byproduct via circulatory alteration may contribute mechanism lead ascites formation . It important note randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial oral administration quinolone ciprofloxacin ( 500 mg/day 1 year ) conduct small series patient moderately severe cirrhosis , low ascitic fluid protein concentration ( &lt; 1.5 g/dL ) prior history SBP . However , ciprofloxacin therapy significantly increase 1-year probability free SBP . Taken together find 2 previous small-size trial suggest long-term oral quinolone therapy effective mainly patient severe cirrhosis . This decide perform large multicenter , randomize , parallel , placebo-controlled trial assess effect norfloxacin survival patient cirrhosis severe liver failure ( Child-Pugh grade C ) . In addition , effect norfloxacin development main complication cirrhosis investigate . The primary outcome measure 6-month survival . The secondary outcome measure proportion transplant patient , occurrence complication ( bacterial infection , renal failure , hepatic encephalopathy gastrointestinal bleeding ) . All adult patient severe cirrhosis might randomize write consent . Pregnant person ; patient treat quinolone month inclusion , allergy quinolones , hepatocellular carcinoma , HIV infection include . Patients receive either norfloxacin placebo day 6 month . Three hundred ninety-two patient necessary decrease 6-month mortality rate 40 % placebo group 25 % norfloxacin group beta risk 90 % alpha risk 5 % . Patients followed-up every month 6 month 9 12 month .</detailed_description>
