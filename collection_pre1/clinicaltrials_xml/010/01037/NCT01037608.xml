	<brief_summary>Background : - The therapeutic modality cannabis receive research attention recently discovery ability stimulate appetite provide pain nausea relief patient AIDS , cancer , multiple sclerosis , among disease . Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) , experimental drug derive marijuana plant , contain tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) cannabidiol ( CBD ) , affect brain activity . Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) test determine extent affect brain activity . - Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use magnetic wave study brain activity . Researchers interested use fMRI study Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) affect regional brain activity , include think ability behavior . Objectives : - To study change regional brain activity produce Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) compare THC placebo . - To determine Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) process body . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 45 year age either current user cannabis ( less daily ) healthy volunteer use cannabis . Design : - The study involve one training session five test session separate day . - At every session , subject receive either THC placebo capsule either Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) placebo spray . - Participants complete training session mock fMRI scanner adapt fMRI scan environment . In training session , participant practice test track think ability , attention , work memory , cognitive task . - Participants five fMRI scan session test practice previously , provide blood , urine , saliva sample require researcher . Participants discharge approximately 12 hour arrive study session ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cannabis sativa contain sixty cannabinoids , include delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) cannabidiol ( CBD ) . CBD lack psychoactivity may attenuate subjective effect produce THC . The ratio THC : CBD illicit cannabis US approximately 20:1 . Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) , whole-plant cannabinoid extract oromucosal spray , contain THC CBD ratio nearly 1:1 . It approve Health Canada 2005 prescription medication neuropathic pain multiple sclerosis ( MS ) evaluate Phase III trial U.S. patient advance cancer treatment pain refractory opiate . No study examine change regional brain activity functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) completion cognitive task affective measure administration Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) . Objective : 1 ) To characterize physiological affective condition , subjective state , cognitive performance , concomitant change activation specific brain region ( blood oxygen level-dependent [ BOLD ] signal ) fMRI oromucosal administration Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) oral administration THC . 2 ) To characterize pharmacokinetics THC CBD metabolites plasma , urine , oral fluid . Subject Population : 18 healthy control 18 healthy cannabis user , 18 - 45 year old , current major psychiatric disorder except nicotine caffeine dependence . Non-dependent substance use allow cannabis user . Cannabis use participant must use cannabis average frequency least last 90 day maximum frequency less daily three month prior study entry . Enrollment target , base national population adult current cannabis user Baltimore City Department Planning 2000 census , 65 % male , 35 % female ; 64 % African American , 32 % Caucasian , 4 % ; 9 % Hispanic 91 % non-Hispanic . Experimental Design Methods : This randomize , double blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , within- between-subject study evaluate effect oral THC oromucosal administration Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) brain activation subjective , affective , cognitive , physiologic measure . Cannabis user undergo thorough medical , psychiatric ( include structure diagnostic interview ) , psychosocial ( include Addiction Severity Index ) evaluation . They enter research unit morning dosing/scanning session . Each cannabis-using participant receives , random order , synthetic THC 5 mg , synthetic THC 15 mg , two actuation Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) ( 5.4 mg THC 5.0 mg cannabidiol ) , six actuation Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) ( 16.2 mg THC 15.0 mg cannabidiol ) , placebo . There interval least five day dose session . Physiological , psychological , behavioral measure monitor throughout study determine onset , magnitude , duration effect correlate THC cannabidiol pharmacokinetics . Changes BOLD signal multiple brain area determine five fMRI scan completion cognitive task affective measure cannabinoid placebo administration . Eighteen control undergo neuroimaging , psychological , behavioral monitoring cannabis user control practice effect . Primary outcome measure include change physiologic effect , subjective effect , BOLD signal , affect , cognitive task performance relation THC , CBD , metabolites plasma concentration . Secondary objective monitor disposition THC , CBD , metabolites plasma , urine , oral fluid . Primary statistical analysis change affect , cognitive performance , physiologic subjective effect within-subject analysis variance ( ANOVA ) ( equivalent analysis ) . Changes BOLD signal determine fMRI compare group dose condition use repeated-measures ANOVA . Based upon power analysis , estimate need 18 cannabis user 18 control complete experiment . Risks Benefits : Potential risk associate administration cannabinoids , propose dos proven safe well tolerated study . The common side effect oromucosal administration Sativex ( Registered Trademark ) include dry mouth , dizziness , application site discomfort , fatigue , somnolence , nausea , diarrhea . Side effect result oral THC administration include sedation , cognitive impairment , euphoria , poor coordination , tachycardia hypotension . There clinical benefit participant . Likely scientific benefit great understanding role cannabidiol modify impact THC cognitive performance , affective condition , subjective state , physiological condition , brain activation .</detailed_description>
