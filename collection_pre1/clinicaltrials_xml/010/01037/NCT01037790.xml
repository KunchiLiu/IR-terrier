	<brief_title>PHASE II TRIAL OF THE CYCLIN-DEPEDENT KINASE INHIBITOR PD 0332991 IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate follow treatment PD 0332991 follow malignancy : 1 ) Metastatic breast cancer , 2 ) Metastatic colorectal cancer , 3 ) Metastatic melanoma CDK4 mutation amplification , 4 ) Cisplatin-refractory , unresectable germ cell tumor . II . To evaluate safety tolerability PD 0332991 administer subject refractory solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacodynamic effect PD0332991 tumor non-tumor tissue . II . To investigate relationship select biomarkers , PK and/or efficacy safety outcome . III . To estimate population pharmacokinetic PD 0332991 correlate PK efficacy outcome . IV : To perform Phase II evaluation PD 0332991 population define potential responder basis CCND1 gene amplification . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral PD 0332991 daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Disease Characteristics : All Subjects : All subject treat protocol histologically document cancer one follow type : A. Metastatic breast cancer ( 7 triple negative , 23 ER+ first 15 patient enrolled nonCCND1cohort ; addition 10 HER2+ combination trastuzumab PD0332991 therapy ) 55 total enrollment slot B. Metastatic colorectal cancer harbor Kras BRAF mutation ( 1530 enrollment slot ) C. Advanced metastatic esophageal and/or gastric cancer ( 1530 enrollment slot ) D. Cisplatinrefractory , unresectable germ cell tumor ( 1530 enrollment slot ) E. Any tumor type tissue test positive CCND1 amplification , CDK4/6 mutation , CCND2 amplification OR functional alteration G1/S checkpoint . ( 1530 enrollment slot ) Biopsy Requirements : For Subjects accessible disease amenable biopsy : A biopsy obtain pretreatment cycle 1 ( patient receive drug ) molecular marker cell cycle , inhibition . Subjects &gt; 18 year old The subject disease assessable tumor marker , physical , radiologic mean . The subject Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . The subject adequate organ function , define follow A. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) B. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min , C. For subject without liver metastasis : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN D. For subject liver metastasis : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 5 x ULN All tumor must test positive Rb expression except : A. ER positive metastatic breast tumor ( data show Rb positive . ) B . Any tumor type tissue test positive CCND1 amplification , CDK4/6 mutation , CCND2 amplification OR functional alteration G1/S checkpoint . The subject adequate marrow function , define follow : A . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/mm3 B. Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 , C. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL The subject capable understanding comply protocol requirement sign informed consent document . Sexually active subject ( male female ) must use accepted method contraception course study 3 month last dose protocol drug ( ) . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Females childbearing potential define sexually mature woman without prior hysterectomy evidence menses past 12 month . However , woman amenorrheic 12 month still consider childbearing potential amenorrhea possibly due prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , ovarian suppression . Exclusion Criteria The subject receive cytotoxic chemotherapy ( include investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy ) within 3 week ( nitrosoureas mitomycin C within 6 week ) first dose PD 0332991. . Patients HER2overexpressing tumor may receive trastuzumab date start therapy , may continue receive trastuzumab receive PD0332991 . The subject receive type investigational agent within 28 day first dose study treatment . The subject recover clinicallymeaningful toxicity due prior therapy ( i.e. , back baseline Grade ≤ 1 ) , exception neurotoxicity alopecia . The subject untreated uncontrolled brain metastasis evidence leptomeningeal involvement disease unless subject teratoma case s/he may eligible eligibility criterion meet The subject uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : 1. ongoing active infection 2. diabetes mellitus 3. hypertension 4. symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , stroke myocardial infarction within 3 month The subject baseline correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470 m . The subject pregnant breastfeeding . The subject know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Note : baseline HIV screening require The subject unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator designee .</criteria>
