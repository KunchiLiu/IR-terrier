	<brief_title>Anticipation Difficult Airway : Preoperative Airway Assessment Form</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Predicting difficult airway continue problematic even seasoned anesthesiologist . In study , resident class sample population . The resident randomly assign two group : experimental group utilize new preoperative airway assessment form control group utilize standard anesthesia record . Simultaneously , subset anesthesia expert also assess patient preoperatively . The five area difficult airway management consider : difficult mask ventilation , difficult supraglottic airway , difficult laryngoscopy , difficult intubation , difficult surgical airway . According American Society Anesthesiologists , incidence intubation remain stable throughout 1980s 1990s despite attempt predict occurrence . Many case consider preventable ; therefore , good prediction preparation difficult airway management may lead reduction adverse event .</detailed_description>
