	<brief_summary>Background : - Motor stereotypies movement disorder characterize involuntary , repetitive , rhythmic movement . These movement predictable pattern seem purposeful , serve obvious function , tend prolong , suppress . Common example motor stereotypies include hand waving , head nodding , body rock . - Researchers interested learn motor stereotypies . Many child autism developmental disorder tend exhibit behavior , normal healthy child even adult demonstrate motor stereotypies certain condition ( include boredom stress ) . More research need determine internal cause potential successful treatment behavior . Objectives : - To use electroencephalography ( EEG ) study cerebral activity relate stereotypies child . Eligibility : - Children 7 18 year age demonstrate stereotypy movement consistent basis ( least 10 time day least 4 month ) . Design : - The study require two visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - First visit : Outpatient screen visit determine child eligibility study , include questionnaire parents/guardians medical assessment stereotypies . - Second visit : Participating child spend 1 day room NIH Clinical Center Pediatric Day Hospital . During visit , participant wear portable EEG unit measure brain activity . For first hour visit , researcher perform movement test study brain activity relate normal movement . For rest day , participant may play game , watch television movie , read , nap , continue wear EEG monitor brain activity related stereotypic movement . - Participants receive small amount compensation time participation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebral Activity Related Primary Motor Stereotypies Children : An EEG Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Motor stereotypy common movement disorder observe child adolescent whose pathophysiology unknown . Therefore , overall objective study cerebral activity relate stereotypies . First , want define whether motor stereotypies precede cortical potential , observe voluntary movement . We hypothesize pre-movement potential precede stereotypies . However , pre-movement potential observe , secondary objective compare potential cortical potential precede voluntary movement . We also aim study cortical potential precede voluntary movement healthy child compare potential observe child stereotypies . Study population 12 child present primary motor stereotypies 12 healthy child . Design Using 19 scalp electrode , record patient electroencephalographic ( EEG ) activity 8 hour one day . The electromyographic ( EMG ) activity muscle involve stereotypies record surface EMG electrodes . Healthy child undergo EEG 2 hour . During EEG recording , ask perform arm movement . Outcome measure Primary outcome : latency amplitude evoke induced activity ( cortical potential ) relate motor stereotypies measure . Secondary outcome : latency amplitude evoke induced activity relate voluntary movement measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Population 12 child present primary motor stereotypies recruit well 12 healthy child . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients : Children eligible participate meet follow criterion : Are 7 18 year old ; Are identify complexmotor stereotypies predominant movement consist repetitive arm flapping , hand waving , finger wiggle movement ( child present movement include ) ; Predominant stereotypic movement must start six year age ; Predominant stereotypic movement must present least four month occur least 10 time day ; Dr Harvey Singer must witness movement either person via videotape . The use medication affect central nervous system allow study . Subjects diagnosis ADHD , obsessivecompulsive disorder , conduct disorder , learn disability include . Healthy volunteer : Children eligible participate meet follow criterion : Are 7 18 year old ; Are able give inform assent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients : Subjects exclude study : Diagnosis autism , autistic spectrum disorder , Asperger syndrome , Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS , mental retardation ( IQ &lt; 70 ) ; Concurrent significant medical , neurological , psychiatric condition ; Use tranquilizer , psychotropic drug medication could modulate cortical activity , subject take medication month prior screen visit . As consequence , child stimulant medication ADHD exclude study . Healthy volunteer : Abnormal neurological exam , current past history neurological disease psychiatric disease . Patients neurological disease central nervous system impair motor system cognitive function exclude ; Use tranquilizer , psychotropic drug medication could modulate cortical activity , subject take medication month prior screen visit .</criteria>
