	<detailed_description>1.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 1.1 . To evaluate efficacy allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) either achieve complete remission ( CR ) induction chemotherapy experience recurrent leukemia achieve second CR salvage chemotherapy . The efficacy treatment measure term frequency relapse HCT duration remission ( primary endpoint ) . 1.2 . The secondary end point study include ; engraftment ( absolute neutrophil count 500/㎕ , unsupported platelet count 20,000/㎕ ) , donor chimerism 2 4 week HCT , secondary graft failure , acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , lymphocyte subset recovery 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) reactivation/CMV disease , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) reactivation/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder , transplantation-related mortality ( 100 day , 1 year ) , leukemia free survival , overall survival . 1 . 3 . The hematopoietic cell donor study include ; HLA-matched sibling donor , HLA-matched unrelated donor , HLA-mismatched family member , majority patient achieve CR induction salvage chemotherapy undergo allogeneic HCT part consolidation therapy . 2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 2.1 . ALL malignant disorder characterize rapid proliferation immature lymphocytes , result accumulation infiltration neoplastic lymphocytes blood/bone marrow tissue . Allogeneic HCT curative therapeutic modality significant proportion patient ALL . Allogeneic HCT HLA-matched sibling donor produce long-term leukemia free survival patient ALL high-risk first CR second CR . ( 1 ) In adult standard-risk ALL , great benefit achieve matched sibling allogeneic transplantation compare autologous transplantation consolidation/maintenance therapy first CR status . ( 2 ) 2.2 . Wider application allogeneic HCT patient ALL , however , impede limited donor availability . Less third patient need allogeneic HCT HLA-matched sibling donate hematopoietic cell . For patient HLA-matched donor family , provide carry rare private HLA-haplotype , HLA-matched unrelated donor find . ( 3 ) The chance find willing unrelated donor Korea 50 % . On hand , nearly patient need allogeneic HCT least one HLA-haploidentical familial member , willing give hematopoietic cell immediately , initial transplantation , also subsequent additional donation , become necessary . Early attempt transplant allogeneic hematopoietic cell across barrier HLA-haplotype difference meet high frequency engraftment failure severe graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . ( 4 , 5 ) Depletion donor T cell graft HCT decrease frequency severity GVHD . However , result increase graft failure , delay immune reconstitution , increase fatal infection . ( 6-8 ) Further effort improve outcomes HLA-mismatched familial donor HCT include use polyclonal ( 9 , 10 ) monoclonal antibody ( 11 , 12 ) T cell part condition regimen ( vivo-T cell depletion ) incorporation concept feto-maternal immune tolerance donor selection process among several available HLA-haploidentical family member . ( 13 ) 2.3 . In addition aforementioned approach , use RIC set HLA-mismatched familial donor HCT explore . Various RIC regimen , utilize total body irradiation ( TBI ) , ( 14 , 15 ) busulfan , ( 16 , 17 ) melphalan , ( 18 ) along fludarabine , show effective achieve successful engraftment less transplantation-related mortality ( TRM ) , especially elderly patient patient organ dysfunction , set HLA-matched donor HCT . These finding show adequate immunosuppression , necessarily myeloablation , patient , donor hematopoietic cell engraft complete donor hematopoietic chimerism achieve . There data suggest principle may extend HLA-mismatched HCT setting well . Successful engraftment allogeneic hematopoietic cell across HLA-haplotype difference well-documented RIC animal model , ( 19-21 ) infant severe combine immunodeficiency syndrome . ( 22 , 23 ) In adult patient hematologic malignancy , several study involve small number patient show feasibility successful engraftment hematopoietic cell graft HLA-haploidentical familial donor RIC . ( 24-27 ) 2.4 . Data generate hospital enhance evidence feasibility hematopoietic engraftment across HLA-haplotype barrier adult patient RIC . ( 28 ) Between April 2004 February 2008 , 31 patient ( include 21 patient acute leukemia ) underwent HLA-haploidentical HCT RIC busulfan , fludarabine , ATG 28 evaluable patient achieve engraftment absolute lymphocyte count ( ANC ) 500/㎕ median day 16.5 . As early 2 week HCT , 22 24 evaluated patient show complete donor chimerism 95 % . None patient study experienced secondary graft failure . While achieve consistent durable donor cell engraftment , cumulative incidence grade 2-4 acute chronic GVHD 19 % , 20 % , respectively . 2.5 . Between May 2008 May 2009 , 31 additional patient acute leukemia treat HLA-mismatched HCT use treatment strategy aforementioned study . As , data 52 patient available . There 24 male 28 female median age 39.5 year ( range , 16-70 ) . Thirty-seven patient AML , 13 ALL , 2 acute mixed lineage leukemia . Ten patient first CR status , 15 second third CR status , 27 refractory disease . The donor either offspring ( n=23 ) , mother ( n=16 ) , sibling ( n=13 ) patient median age 37 year ( range , 3-68 ) . The condition regimen HCT include busulfan reduced-dose , fludarabine , antithymocyte globulin . GVHD prophylaxis give cyclosporine methotrexate . Other 4 patient experienced leukemia progression within 30 day HCT die early , rest 48 patient achieve donor cell engraftment absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 500/㎕ median 14.5 day ( range , 10-27 ) . One patient experience secondary graft failure subsequently . Cumulative incidence rate acute GVHD grade 2-4 chronic GVHD 10 % ( 95 % CI , 4 % -23 % ) 33 % ( 95 % CI , 22 % -51 % ) , respectively . Cumulative incidence rate leukemia progression/recurrence 13 % , 41 % , 77 % patient CR1 , CR2-3 , refractory leukemia time HCT . In , five patient series die without leukemia progression/recurrence give transplantation-related mortality ( TRM ) rate 12 % ( 95 % CI , 5 % -29 % ) . Kaplan-Meier event-free survival overall survival rate 44 % 50 % patient CR1 HCT , 40 % 23 % patient CR2-3 , 10 % 15 % patient refractory leukemia . These result show HCT HLA-mismatched family member perform patient acute leukemia successfully without increase GVHD TRM . 2.6 . In current prospective study , try integrate HLA-mismatched HCT overall care patient ALL first second CR . In past , patient without HLA-matched donor family unrelated donor registry offer allogeneic HCT . The outcome HCT analyze accord several clinical variable patient , disease , donor characteristic .</detailed_description>
