We perform routine biomedical assessment part DAFNE programme normal diabetes care ( e.g . HbA1c ( measure long-term blood glucose control ) , weight , blood pressure , blood biochemistry ) , ask patient recall hypoglycaemic ( low blood sugar ) event . We also ask participant fill research questionnaire , take 45-60 minute fill time . They include question diabetes , quality life , well-being diabetes knowledge . These assessment make 3 time pointsÍ¾ baseline , 6 12 month . The main outcome measure change HbA1c , biomedical psychosocial parameter secondary importance .
