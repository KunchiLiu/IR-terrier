	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Rho , one small GTPase protein , downstream target molecule , Rho-kinase ( ROCK ) , play important role mediate various cellular function , include contractility , actin cytoskeleton organization , cell adhesion motility , proliferation , cytokinesis gene expression , involve pathogenesis cardiomyocyte contractility vascular disease . The investigator thus hypothesize ROCK pathway play important role function severity heart failure ( HF ) one possible pathway currently apply cardiovascular medicine affect prognosis among HF treatment . Previous study show patient HF , intra-arterial infusion fasudil cause preferential increase forearm blood flow compare control subject , suggest involvement Rho/Rho-kinase pathway increase peripheral vascular HF failure remain examine . Besides , whether rho kinase activity enhance response current medication HF patient remain unsolved . Aim : ROCK activity leave ventricular function HF non-HF population survey response ACEi Tx .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : We enroll subject clinic National Cheng Kung University Hospital . Subjects divide two group leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ratio : preserve LVEF ( EF &gt; 40 % ) impair LVEF ( EF &lt; 40 % ) . All subject initially receive 10mg enalapril gradually titrate 20mg blood pressure tolerance 6 month . Before 6 month , echocardiography blood sample assay biomarkers rho kinase activity , respectively . Outcomes measurement : The outcome include mean change Rho-kinase activity leukocytes period treatment . Leukocyte Rho-kinase expression activity measure cell isolated peripheral blood sample freeze -80 °C . The outcomes correlation mean change Rho-kinase activity leukocytes cardiac function measure 2D M-mode echocardiography . In addition , calculate association ROCK activity B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) well relation clinical characteristic . The demographic , relevant clinical data laboratory result collect patient and/or medical record . Primary Outcomes measurement : The primary outcome mean change Rho-kinase activity leukocytes period treatment . Leukocyte Rho-kinase expression activity measure cell isolated peripheral blood sample freeze -80 °C . Western Blot assay perform measure Rho-kinase activity . Secondary Outcomes measurement : The secondary outcome correlation mean change Rho-kinase activity leukocytes cardiac function measure echocardiography tissue Doppler measure systolic diastolic function . In addition , association Rho kinase activity BNP , hsCRP well relation clinical characteristic measure . Besides , check renal liver function deterioration , change serum potassium level , need kidney replacement therapy postural hypotension dizziness shock event monitor safety issue . Other parameter add medication record , include side effect like cough , angioedema , skin rash , intolerance medication .</detailed_description>
