	<brief_summary>Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) / Kala-azar ( KA ) public health problem many country world include Bangladesh . Where 90,000 VL case report since 1994 . The disease fatal treat . Even treatment mortality rate high ( 10 % ) . VL vector-borne disease , cause parasite Leishmania donovani ( LD ) transmit female sandfly sp . Phlebotomus argentipes . Not people expose LD parasite develop disease . According observation 30 % infected LD parasite develop disease within one year diagnosis . Malnutrition intestinal helminth infection find associate risk active VL . Down regulation Th1 cellular immune response confers susceptibility active VL . Both malnutrition intestinal helminth infection regulate Th1 cellular immune response . Till establish prophylaxis active VL among people expose LD infection . Many study include show periodic regular deworming reduce malnutrition significantly . Micronutrient zinc iron well vitamin A supplementation also improve malnutrition may enhance Th1 cellular immune response . Thus hypothesize periodic deworming . micronutrient vitamin A supplementation together may reduce risk active VL among people expose LD infection . The study carry Harirampur union , Trishal , Mymensingh . This area highly endemic VL . Two hundred asymptomatic VL patient age 2-60 enrolled study . Children age less 2 year , pregnant woman , active VL case , person chronic disease , disable individual refuse write consent enrol study . After enrollment subject divide two group randomization . One group receive deworming nutritional supplement ( intervention group ) group receive placebo ( placebo group ) . Two group follow 12 month active surveillance develop active VL . In addition morbidity data , monthly stool sampling , monthly anthropometry , urine blood sample baseline , treatment active VL carry Successful completion study derive result provide useful information whether periodic deworming micronutrient vitamin A supplementation reduce risk active VL among people expose LD infection .</brief_summary>
