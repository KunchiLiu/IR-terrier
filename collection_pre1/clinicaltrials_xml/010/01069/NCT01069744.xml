	<brief_summary>The development suck behavior preterm infant think reflect neurobehavioral maturation organization . From clinical perspective , ability feed depend upon coordinated sucking , swallow breathe pattern . In preterm infant le 32 week gestation , ability usually effective enough sustain full oral feed . In interim , infant feed gavage tube mature enough take milk directly breast bottle ( Pinelli , Symington , 2005 ) . Non-nutritive sucking use gavage feed transition gavage breast/bottle feeding . The rationale intervention non-nutritive suck facilitates development suck behavior improves digestion enteral feed .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Primary Hypothesis The use pattern oral somatosensory entrainment stimulation program ( NTrainer© ) safely accelerate development oromotor skill ( suck ) preterm infant expect significantly enhance development oral feeding skill . Non-nutritive suck development assess several dimension oromotor output include suck burst structure , minute-rates suck cycle production , novel quantitative measure suck pattern formation know non-nutritive suck spatiotemporal index ( NNS STI ) ( Poore , Barlow , Wang , Estep , 2007 , revision Dev Med Child Neurology ; Poore , Barlow , Wang , Gu , 2007 , prep Dev Med Child Neurol ) . Measures feed skill include measurement transition time ( day ) 100 % oral feed , feed rate ( ml/min ) , pulse oximetry , documentation reflux spit event . Secondary measure include documentation infant growth rate compare intervention . The growth rate assess examine change weight , head circumference length 28 day follow initiation oral feeding . Safety assess monitoring mortality , occurrence feeding problem ( number day feeding withhold ; ie NPO day ) , necrotizing enterocolitis , aspiration event . Enrollment We conduct randomize control trial evaluate efficacy NTrainer suck development oral feed performance . We estimate need study 100 preterm infant test primary hypothesis . ( see sample size calculation Statistical Analysis section ) . Enrollment include 50 treatment / 50 control . Expected ethnic proportion Kansas [ US Federal Census ] African American 5.9 % , Asian American 1.8 % , Hispanic American 5.6 % , Native American 0.9 % , White 86.3 % , All others -- Study Population Inclusion Criteria 1 . Documentation inform consent . Informed consent obtain principal investigator ( ) and/or designate research staff subject randomize study . We PACIRB approve Spanish version consent form available interested participant . 2 . Gestational age 23 week 0/7 day 34 week per best estimate neonatologist . 3 . If subject transfer another hospital , ability obtain follow-up data outcome . 4 . Ready oral feeding . Neonates meet eligibility criterion ( A-E ) assess health care team ( neonatology occupational/developmental therapist ) NTrainer begin 32 week post menstrual age ( e.g. , 9 week age neonate bear 23 week estimate gestational age ) . If consider ready feeding enrol . Feeding readiness criterion include : A. Initiate health care team feel baby ready try oral feed . B. Hemodynamically stable . C. Stable O2 saturation level suck ( infant maintain SpO2 level ≥ 90 suck ) . D. Alert active : neurologic exam appropriate post-menstrual age E. No sign sepsis intolerance gastric feeding Exclusion Criteria 1 . Gestational age &lt; 23 week &gt; 34 week . 2 . Any major congenital anomaly ( chromosomal abnormality , nervous system anomaly , cyanotic congenital heart disease , gastroschisis , omphalocele , diaphragmatic hernia and/or major gastrointestinal anomaly ) . 3 . Major neurological injury include intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH grade III IV ) , periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) . 4 . Not ready oral feeding determine health care team . Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measures ( Primary Study Endpoints ) 1 . The Non-Nutritive Suck SpatioTemporal Index ( NNS STI ) use characterize emergence integrity suck central pattern generator ( sCPG ) quantitative statistical analysis suck pattern stability . This procedure involve calculation nipple compression variability across multiple suck burst . By calculate cumulative sum standard deviation amplitude- time- normalize set NNS pressure trajectory , suck development represent single numerical value know NNS STI . The mathematics underlie STI well suit quantitatively track emergence ororhythmic stereotypy NNS development preterm infant ( Poore , Barlow , Wang , Estep , Lee , 2007 ) . The STI indicate degree set motor trajectory converge single underlie template , stability neuromotor sequence exhibit preterm infant . This approach conceptually unique previous study suck development attempt characterize ororhythmic activity parametric analysis mean suck per burst , suck per second per burst , suck width intersuck width . The NNS STI calculate 7 , 14 , 21 28 day randomization assess maturation suck coordination . Details NNS STI calculation : Two minute digitize ororhythmic pressure waveform great number pressure peak great 1 cm H2O , reflect infant 's active period oromotor output , select NNS STI analysis . Because analysis NNS spatiotemporal stability depend compare suck burst fix peak ( suck cycle ) number , first five peak five successive burst identify two-minute ororhythmic pressure waveform sample . For infant degrade NNS pattern structure , first five burst-like mouthing movement identify , base period , amplitude , duration . The selection NNS burst calculation non-nutritive suck STI complete specialized LabVIEW© software program develop Dr. Barlow 's laboratory know NNS STI . NNS STI program initially perform pressure peak detection burst identify time location peak . After desired pressure peak location identify , start- end-points select NNS burst calculate extend analysis window 300 sample prior first peak 300 sample follow fifth peak , order ensure accurate pressure peak waveform discrimination . Amplitude time normalization five burst complete next . Time normalization base linear interpolation , project five-peak-bursts ensemble analysis window base preset abscissa scale 10,000 data sample . Amplitude normalization accomplish deduct mean divide standard deviation trajectory . The NNS STI represent cumulative sum standard deviation , index 100 m interval , normalize NNS burst waveform . 2 . Transition-to-Oral Feed ( TOF ) : Time initiation oral feeding full independent feeding ( i.e. , gavage supplementation take least 120-180 ml/kg/day . ) 3 . Length-of-Stay ( LOS ) NICU . 4 . Occurrence follow 28 day study period : - necrotizing enterocolitis - clinical suspicion aspiration feed event ( i.e. , cough , spit-ups , O2 desaturation ) . - number day feed withhold 12 hour ( NPO ) - death Secondary Outcome Measures Growth velocity 28 day initiation oral feeding : 1 . Weight Gain ( gms/kg/day ) = [ wt ( gm ) 28 day - bw ( gm ) ] / bw / 28 day 2 . Head Growth ( cm/wk ) = [ hc ( cm ) 28 day - hc ( cm ) birth ] / 3 wks • Occipitofrontal circumference = place measure tape around front head , brow occipital area . The measuring tape ears . 3 . Length Growth ( cm/wk ) = [ len ( cm ) 28 day - len ( cm ) birth ] / 3 wks Abbreviations : birth weight ( bw ) ; weight ( wt ) ; gram ( gm ) ; head circumference ( hc ) ; centimeter ( cm ) , length ( len ) week ( wks ) . During course study , adverse event monitor ensure rate report event exceed expect rate . Randomization Treatment Assignment Randomization take place use electronic randomization schedule generate Minitab v. 15 statistical software program . Neonates start trial oral feeding randomly assign one two group - initiation oral feeding NTrainer Control group .</detailed_description>
