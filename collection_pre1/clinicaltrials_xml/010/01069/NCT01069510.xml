	<brief_summary>The purpose study see study drug call spironolactone reduce fibrous ( stiffen ) heart muscle tissue improve heart function . Subjects study title `` Heart Failure Congenital Heart Disease : role myocardial fibrosis '' evidence heart dysfunction and/or evidence fibrosis ( stiffen ) heart muscle ask take part study . This study include randomize subject receive study drug placebo . Randomization occur visit 1 . Visit 1 include following : - Subjects answer question well breathe . - An MRI . Dye call gadolinium inject subject 's vein . - They go Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute 2 tablespoon blood drawn intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( tube ) . - They 6 minute walk test.. - They also echocardiogram , test look movement subject 's heart . A technician place cool jelly chest use small wand take picture skin . Subjects ' also visit 3-6 week , 3 , 6 , 9 month , 12 month randomization . Visits 2-5 include follow : - They go Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute 1/2 tablespoon blood drawn . - They 6 minute walk test . During test , walk back forth hallway . The goal walk far possible 6 minute . Subjects probably get breath become exhaust . If , slow , stop , rest need . Blood pressure take walk . - They health review 6 month . Visit 6 identical visit 1 include following : - Subjects answer question well breathe . - An MRI . Dye call gadolinium inject subject 's vein . - They go Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute 2 tablespoon blood drawn intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( tube ) . - They 6 minute walk test.. - They also echocardiogram , test look movement subject 's heart . A technician place cool jelly chest use small wand take picture skin . The investigator compare study drug , call spironolactone , placebo regard change heart stiffen function heart .</brief_summary>
