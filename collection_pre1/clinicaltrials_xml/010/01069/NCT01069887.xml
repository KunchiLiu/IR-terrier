	<brief_title>A Prospective Registry Febrile Events Patients With Malignant Hemopathies Subjected Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Problems infection onco-haematological patient assume ever increase importance recent year , relation development management principle various clinical entity . Indeed , infection primarily correlate reduced immunocompetence ( cellular humoral immunity ) follow intensive chemotherapy use immunosuppressant drug allotransplantation procedure . Furthermore , common haematological disorder ( i.e . acute chronic myeloid lymphoid leukaemia , lymphoma , myeloma etc ) treatment require disease contribute towards mediate modulate risk infection . Among various pathogen responsible infection onco-haematological patient , fungi still represent problem diagnosis , despite current therapeutic option , contribute significantly towards transplant-related mortality . The various candidaemias account 30-40 % death , invasive aspergillosis 50-60 % , 75 % death account infection cause zygomycetes . Fungal agent include yeast ( e.g . Candida ) mould ( e.g . Aspergillus , Zygomycetes ) ; however recent year , different epidemiological trend observe aforementioned macro-categories etiological agent : progressive reduction epidemiological clinical burden cause Candida spp infection , opposite trend observe caused mould , Aspergillus spp . . Nevertheless , clinician well aware epidemiological development variable associate risk real incidence fungal infection patient malignant haemopathies and/or subject transplant entirely know . A recent multicentre retrospective study GIMEMA group assess mould infection patient malignant haemopathies 10 year period . This study show 6-7 % patient acute leukaemia develop mould infection one various stage disease ( onset remission , relapse , rescue therapy , etc ) . Despite undoubted use data first assessment magnitude problem , thorough epidemiological investigation appear need , within context able plan correct decisional procedure relation treatment , independently documentation infection . Secondly , analysis different diagnostic approach individual specialist , term disease definition diagnostic work-up therapeutic choice , contribute towards overcome high level managerial empiricism still widespread within medical sector . The information gather study nature prove useful deducing correct diagnostic approach suitable therapeutic decision , day day clinical practice . Hence , integrate , computerised system , capable record various different aspect , certainly help haematology specialist . Aims objectives project The aim registry : 1. assess many suspect fungal-related febrile episode identify infective fungal agent . 2. clear view diagnostic therapeutic action management onco-haematological patient suspect fungal-related febrile episode . 3. assess impact anti-fungal therapy timing chemotherapy transplant plan 4. perform drug-epidemiology relationship analysis , observe toxicity interaction antifungal therapy mean creation national database fungal infection patient affect malignant haemopathies Design - A multicentre , prospective registry monitor invasive fungal infection onco-haematological patient - Registration criterion : patient newly diagnose malignant haematological disease ( acute chronic myeloid lymphoid leukaemia , multiple myeloma , non-Hodgkin 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma , aplastic anaemia , myelodysplastic syndrome ) , patient , result onco-haematological pathology , undergone allogenic autologous haematopoietic cell transplant , ongoing febrile episode . The record consecutive febrile event require . - Data collection individual patient perform accord method show enclose flow chart . In case new episode exist patient , say new episode record case record new event . All collect data cod database . - Information relate approximately 500 suspect fungal-related febrile event require antifungal therapy expect collect approximately 60 centre course 18 month . - Data collection event may perform follow provision write informed consent , obtain patient participate health survey . - The data collect handled store full compliance Italian law govern privacy . - Hema e-chart non-interventional registry . The inclusion patient give therapeutic strategy decide advance , fall within normal clinical practice , decision prescribe medication entirely independent include patient health survey . â€¢ Prior application , plan submit Ethics Committees various participate centre . Data registration Hema e-chart electronic case record change real time base chronological organisation infective event therapy prescribe . It allow collection personal , epidemiological , diagnostic therapeutic data pertain patient , process analyse result . ( see appendix ) . This case record locate site access control user ID Password Data registration take place accord method show enclosed flow-chart APPENDIX Hema e-chart Software The Hema e-chart software design used multiple specialise health centre . A configuration function allow automatic recognition centre user submit access credential belongs . The data structure accord follow general outline : The patent basic personal data Description basic pathology Clinical parameter ( neutrophil , temperature , etc ) Disease type Type treatment ( 1st line , 2nd line etc . ) Drugs use Antibiotics Antivirals Antineoplastics Corticosteroids Immunomodulators Cytokines Renal function ( calculate automatically function creatinine level ) Hepatic function Diagnosis fungal infection Chemical factor Microbiological factor Invasive test Name fungal agent identify Site infection Antifungal prophylaxis Antifungal agent select Dosage Mode administration Antifungal therapy Antifungal agent select Dosage Mode administration Outcome Outcome treatment - Complete response ( complete resolution sign symptom , normalisation instrumental and/or mycological test ) - Partial response ( significant clinical improvement sign symptom instrumental and/or mycological test ) . Physician 's evaluation treatment Investigators comment Tolerability antifungal therapy Safety antifungal therapy Monitoring drug interaction The Hema e-chart structure allow data contain case record alter save three time per day , maintain complete history change make . This way possible follow patient 's progress , treatment perform , clinical test request , detail , able ass correlation exist action undertaken effect obtain . For reason , software supply various graphical tool easy evaluation data . The patient may record several time study , incur several febrile event within time period . Data registration allow use personal detail aid consultation data .</detailed_description>
