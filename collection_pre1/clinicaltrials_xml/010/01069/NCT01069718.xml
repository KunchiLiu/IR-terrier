	<brief_title>Evaluating Patterned Oral Somatosensory Entrainment Stimulation Using NTrainer Oral Feeding Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One day prior start study treatment , suck strength coordination measure enrolled infant use NTrainer device `` NeoSuck RT '' assessment mode ( See Appendix A ) . They also clinically assessed Infant Feeding Specialist use clinical assessment tool include NOMAS EFS ( see Appendix B ) . After assessment feeding plan develop use infant 's bedside nurse . This feeding plan include limited use technique oromotor stimulation , side-lying , pace , slow flow nipple . After clinical NeoSuck assessment , infant randomize receive either `` Clinical '' `` NTrainer '' intervention . The intervention period 10 day . For study intervention feeding , infant undergo brief exam physiologic state , use Oral Feeding Readiness Assessment portion EFS . If infant determine ready feed ( ) infant cradle supportive inclined posture , swaddle , limb position midline , background/overhead lighting dim area . The infant remain connected usual ICN monitor time observation respiration , heartbeat oxygen saturation . In Clinical group bottle feeding attempt bedside nurse , use technique suggest feeding plan . The Infant Feeding Specialist observe least one feed per day assure feed plan adhere . If , judgment person feed infant , infant unable complete bottle feeding , remain volume give via indwell gavage tube . During gavage feeding , total partial , infant offer pacifier suck . In NTrainer group , three feeding per day give via gavage tube infant receive NTrainer stimulation . The stimulation do alternate 3 minute epoch NTrainer stimulation 3 minute suck regular pacifier , total time 30 minute . Bottle feeding attempt daily feeding bedside nurse use technique suggest feeding plan . If infant unable complete bottle feeding , remain volume give via indwell gavage tube . During gavage feeding , total partial , infant offer pacifier suck . Every day , 15 minute prior feed one study session , infant 's suck strength coordination measure use NTrainer device `` NeoSuck RT '' Assessment mode . If infant able successfully bottle feed full prescribed volume 5 8 feeding per 24 hour , study intervention end . On day study intervention period complete infant assessed investigator unaware infant 's study group assignment . The assessment include ( 1 ) 3-minute measurement suck strength coordination use `` NeoSuck RT '' , ( 2 ) two observational checklist ( NOMAS EFS ) use score infant feeding behavior . The amount oral feeding percentage daily feeding volume record , well number feeding-associated apnea/bradycardia/oxygen desaturation event precede 24 hour . The NTrainer recording interpret researcher University Kansas , baby 's medical information keep confidential . The NTrainer study result become part WakeMed record . Each baby 's study record available Neonatology division WakeMed Faculty Physicians .</detailed_description>
