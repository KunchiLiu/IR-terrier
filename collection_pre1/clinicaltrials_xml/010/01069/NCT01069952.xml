	<detailed_description>Despite availability effective treatment , substantial portion patient fail recover episode depression . Assuming conservative rate 20 % , give prevalence major depression general population , 3.5 million Americans would expect manifest refractory illness depression receive treatment . Although rarely used U.S. , neurosurgical approach severely refractory depression show efficacy number uncontrolled study , primarily European investigator . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) procedure involve use thin wire carry electric current part brain associate produce depression symptom . DBS effectively safely used treat movement disorder , Parkinson 's disease , may beneficial reduce depression symptom severity . This study evaluate safety efficacy DBS treat people severe treatment-resistant depression . Study participation follow-up last three year . Participants allow remain pre-surgical medication behavioral therapy program throughout study . Before surgery , participant undergo series initial test examination include physical neurological examination ; laboratory test screen significant hematologic , hepatic , renal endocrine abnormality ; detail psychological test include test perception , learning , memory . Implantation device preform single session . The patient undergo local anesthesia implantation lead , implant pulse generator implant general anesthesia . On day surgery , participant metal frame fix head support surgery . Using coordinate individually determine preoperative MRI , pair tetrapolar lead insert anterior limb internal capsule fix skull burr hole ring cap . The lead insert stimulation sit span dorsal-ventral extent anterior capsule target ventral half anterior capsule . After placement DBS system , patient admit hospital overnight evaluation possible complication procedure , include possible hemorrhage infection . Postoperative evaluation consist physical neurological examination , postoperative CBC , electrolyte panel , plain x-ray study head , neck , chest include standard shunt series ensure integrity connection document position stimulate hardware . A head CT scan obtain within 24 hour postoperatively monitor possible postoperative intracranial hemorrhage . If none complication occur , patient discharge home follow day DBS system allow resolution cellular reaction electrode placement . Three week placement DBS system , patient return outpatient phase test effect stimulation . During intensive outpatient phase study , outpatient visit last approximately two hour . These anticipate occur 1 5 day interval . On day , brief clinical interview obtain structured rating depressive symptom , mood affect , possible side effect , cognition . After completion two year study , patient give choice continue DBS , total three year implantation , stimulator battery fail . Patients also offer alternative treatment , outside study , include anterior capsulotomy , depend availability give patient 's financial circumstance insurance coverage , conventional therapy . Long-term patient follow-up continue indefinitely possible . During study , patient also invite undergo series three Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan separate IRB protocol Massachusetts General Hospital , assess effect capsular stimulation activity brain circuit implicate depression . Subjects ' participation separate protocol condition enter DBS study .</detailed_description>
