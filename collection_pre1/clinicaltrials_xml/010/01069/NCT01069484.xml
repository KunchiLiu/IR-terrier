	<brief_summary>Although pregnancy childbirth associate happiness positive life change woman , also consider risk period injury pelvic floor development pelvic floor dysfunction . This may leed devastate loss function quality life ( Ashton-Miller &amp; DeLancey 2007 ) . The aim study evaluate effect postpartum pelvic floor muscle train primiparous woman without pelvic floor muscle injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postpartum Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Women With Without Injured Pelvic Floor Muscles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injuries pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) fascia may lead urinary incontinence ( UI ) , fecal incontinence , pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) , sensory empty abnormality low urinary tract , defecatory dysfunction , sexual dysfunction chronic pain syndrome ( Bump &amp; Norton 1998 , MacLennan et al 2009 , Turner et al 2000 ) . Prevalence rate common pelvic floor disorder generally high fertile female population To date many randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) demonstrate significant effect pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) treatment stress mixed urinary incontinence , recommend first line treatment stress mixed UI woman ( Level I , Grade A ) ( Abrams 2010 ) . The effect postpartum PFMT prevention treatment urinary incontinence investigate four RCTs ( Sleep 1987 , Meyer 2001 , Chiarelli 2001 , Ewings 2005 ) one match control trial ( Mørkved 1997 ) . The result conflict . The matched control trial Mørkved ( 1997 ) show far effective intervention far , 50 % less prevalence UI training group . Similar result find long term effect 50 % less prevalence UI training group long term effect ( Mørkved 2000 ) . The high effect size may explain close follow-up relative high training dosage . However , RCT , effect may overestimate trial often include systematic review ( Hay-Smith 2008 ) . Only research group measure PFM function strength , study evaluate possible effect PFMT PFM injuries morphology follow pregnancy childbirth . DeLancey ( 1996 ) suggest effect PFMT would much high knew cause incontinence able include intact pelvic floor muscle . This may true , statement also reflect belief muscle injury PFM treat exercise . However , contrast common practice treatment skeletal muscle e.g . sport injury , injury treat believe early mobilization training important speeding tissue healing ( Järvinen 2007 ) . Hence , need conduct RCT high methodological interventional quality ( Herbert 2005 ) investigate effect postpartum PFMT .</detailed_description>
