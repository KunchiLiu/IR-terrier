	<brief_summary>Intracorporeal suture knot tie robotic prostatectomy laparoscopic robotic renal surgery historically consider technically challenging time consume aspect procedure . With improved operative technique well use innovative surgical device , vascular control surgery often less cumbersome compare traditional technique . Current standard method hemostasis include use clip , popular design Hemolock , lock , nonabsorbable plastic clip , use expensive endomechanical stapler . Unfortunately associated time saving operate room , great deal disposable cost associate various device well insignificant device malfunction rate report literature . The aim case-controlled study evaluate Aesculap U-clip device compare current technique vascular control use Teleflex Hemolock clip device minimally invasive genitourinary surgery .</brief_summary>
