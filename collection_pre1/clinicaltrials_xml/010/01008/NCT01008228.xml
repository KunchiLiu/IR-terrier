Air evacuation may achieve simple aspiration ( exsufflation ) conventional chest tube drainage . Chest tube thoracotomy remain popular technique.Aspiration simple technique , allow possibility ambulatory management . The purpose present study compare simple aspiration perform specific thoracentesis device , versus conventional chest tube drainage . Comparison perform immediate efficacity resolution pneumothorax.The hypothesis simple aspiration perform specific device inferior chest tube drainage management first episode large size primary spontaneous pneumothorax . A second goal measure efficacy one week , recidive one year . The trial randomize , control include 200 patient group . The patient enrol 29 hospital France . Emergency department , thoracic surgery pulmonary department hospital primarily contact agreement participate study .</brief_summary>
