	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) lead cause cancer death worldwide incidence 600,000 new case almost many death annually.1 Advanced stage disease diagnosis often preclude curative treatment , overall prognosis patient diagnose advanced HCC remain dismal median survival approximately 8 months.2-4 Until recently , systemic therapy advance HCC demonstrate minimal benefit patient , largely due compromise hepatic function underlie liver disease well intrinsic tumor chemoresistance.5-9 In past year , however , publication Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Protocol ( SHARP ) phase III trial demonstrate significant improvement overall survival ( OS ) patient advance HCC treat biologic agent , sorafenib.4 Despite improvement outcome sorafenib , however , median OS patient advance HCC remain less year , new therapy combination great need combat grim disease . Sorafenib small molecule bi-aryl urea multikinase inhibitor activity . A primary target serine-threonine kinase , Raf-1 . Sorafenib also antiangiogenic activity , inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptors 2 3 platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) .10-12 Preclinical study HCC show Raf-1 kinase signal along prolific tumor angiogenesis common feature , provide molecular rationale efficacy agent.11,13-16 Radiographically , HCC hypervascular tumor , provide additional clinical relevance exuberant angiogenesis observe tumor type preclinical setting.15 The efficacy sorafenib SHARP trial validates importance signal pathway HCC . Another signal pathway may play role hepatocarcinogenesis phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) /phosphatidylinositol-3'kinase ( PI-3 ' K ) /AKT pathway activates mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) kinase , turn trigger multiple downstream cell growth , survival , angiogenesis signals.26-28 Dysregulated phosphorylation activation mTOR signal may occur due loss function PTEN tumor suppressor gene , constitutive activation PI-3 ' K , activation AKT aberrant upstream growth factor receptor signaling.27 Activated mTOR form complexes protein , include regulatory associate protein mTOR ( Raptor ) Rictor.26 The mTOR-Raptor complex turn phosphorylates protein 70 S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) well eukaryotic initiation factor 4E ( eIF-4E ) bind protein-1 ( 4E-BP1 ) . P70S6K 4E-BP1 regulate translation host protein , include several protein involve cell proliferation . Signaling mTOR also stimulate angiogenesis.26,28-30 Activation mTOR may induce endothelial cell proliferation well increase level hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) -1α HIF-2α , potentially via p70S6K-mediated translation versus decrease oxygen-dependent degradation.31-33 HIFs induce angiogenesis response cellular hypoxia transcriptional activation target gene include VEGF.32,34,35 The mTOR inhibitor , sirolimus , macrocyclic lactone rapamycin produce soil bacterium , Streptomyces hygroscopicus . Sirolimus demonstrate fungicidal , immunosuppressive , antiproliferative property widely use immunosuppressant transplant patient prevent allograft rejection.26,36 Inhibitors mTOR also investigation potential anti-cancer agent multiple human malignancy due know proliferative effect mTOR activation . Temsirolimus , everolimus , deforolimus derivative sirolimus similar antiproliferative property vitro.26 Temsirolimus soluble ester analogue sirolimus.37 Temsirolimus approve FDA treatment advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) demonstrate survival benefit monotherapy comparison interferon alpha multicenter phase III trial.38,39 In trial , 626 patient previously untreated , poor prognosis , metastatic RCC randomize receive temsirolimus 25 mg intravenously weekly , 3 million unit interferon alpha subcutaneously three time weekly , combination therapy 15 mg temsirolimus weekly plus 6 million unit interferon alpha three time weekly.39 The primary endpoint , overall survival , 10.9 month temsirolimus group , comparison 7.3 month interferon alpha 8.4 month combination therapy ; overall survival progression free survival ( PFS ) significantly prolong temsirolimus group comparison interferon alpha alone ( P = 0.008 P &lt; 0.001 , respectively ) . Combination molecularly target therapy offer theoretical potential additive synergistic inhibition share target well target parallel pathway may provide escape mechanism single-pathway inhibition . In case mTOR inhibitor , combination therapy Ras pathway inhibition may augment efficacy block pathway upstream mTOR kinase , combination antiangiogenic agent may enhance antiangiogenic effect.26,27</detailed_description>
