	<brief_summary>The primary goal study develop technique identify course phrenic nerve patient already undergo cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) implantation candidate future CRT device undergo implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) pacemaker implantation . Specifically , study intend identify location course leave pericardiophrenic vein , thus leave phrenic nerve , guide location coronary vein lead placement minimize risk phrenic nerve stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phrenic nerve stimulation cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) common adverse event occur 1.5-3 % patient sometimes high 10 % . Phrenic nerve stimulation frequently observe implantation procedure often appear shortly implantation well . Clinically , dyspnea , cough , hiccup occur , uncomfortable tolerate patient long periods time . Resolution clinical outcome require reposition leave coronary vein lead second procedure attendant serious clinical sequela . As CRT lead become small incidence phrenic nerve stimulation likely increase . The risk phrenic nerve stimulation ( PNS ) exist CRT implantation minimally dependent type coronary lead highly dependent upon location leave coronary vein lead relationship leave phrenic nerve stimulation strength . Tedrow et al . demonstrate cohort 71 patient PNS reach 16 % stimulation strength increase maximize mechanical benefit CRT . No current method able predict PNS , one likely method prevent PNS identify location phrenic nerve specific patient , confirm visualization ability stimulate phrenic nerve maximize distance coronary vein lead position nerve . In order reduce incidence phrenic nerve stimulation , Vaseghi perform non-selective injection contrast medium able identify leave pericardiophrenic vein 12 % patient undergoing biventricular pacemaker placement . However , patient , identification leave pericardiophrenic vein provide landmark position left ventricular ( LV ) lead totally eliminated incidence phrenic nerve pacing . The relationship cardiac structure right leave phrenic nerve generally know significantly variable patient . There image clinically available modality allow physician identify location leave phrenic nerve attempt avoid leave coronary vein lead implant procedure . The pericardiophrenic vein deep collateral venous drainage pericardium , pleura diaphragm lie adjacent phrenic nerve right leave side parietal pericardium adjacent pleura . The ostium leave pericardiophrenic vein usually leave brachiocephalic vein opposite entrance leave jugular vein . The left phrenic vein locate general vicinity thymic vein often multiple ostia close proximity . There several case report literature inadvertent cannulation pericardiophrenic vein Swan-Ganz catheter , central venous catheter one report cannulation pace lead lead inadvertent phrenic nerve pacing . The primary goal study develop technique identify course phrenic nerve patient already undergo cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) implantation candidate future CRT device undergo implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) pacemaker implantation . Specifically , study intend identify location course leave pericardiophrenic vein , thus leave phrenic nerve , guide location coronary vein lead placement minimize risk phrenic nerve stimulation .</detailed_description>
