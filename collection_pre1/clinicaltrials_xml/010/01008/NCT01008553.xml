	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety fentanyl opioid-naive participant post-herpetic neuralgia , complex regional pain syndrome post-operative pain syndrome obtain sufficient analgesic effect treatment non-opioid analgesic ( drug use control pain ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Confirmatory Study Fentanyl Participants With Post-herpetic Neuralgia , Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Postoperative Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center ( conducted one center ) , double-blind ( neither participant physician know assign study drug ) , randomize ( participant assign study drug chance ) , withdrawal study opioid-naive participant post-herpetic neuralgia ( intense , typically intermittent pain along course nerve cause varicella zoster virus ) , complex regional pain syndrome post-operative pain syndrome . The study consist titration period ( 10-29 day ) double-blind period ( 12 week ) visit include Day 5-7 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 titration period Day 2-4 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 43 , 57 , 71 85 double-blind period . All eligible participant receive one-day adhesive transdermal patch ( patch contain drug put skin drug enter body skin ) either fentanyl dose range 12.5 50 microgram/hour match placebo . Efficacy evaluate primarily time withdrawal due insufficient analgesic efficacy . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
