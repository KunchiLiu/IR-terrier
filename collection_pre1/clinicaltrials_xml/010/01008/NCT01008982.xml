	<brief_summary>Background rationale Sjögren 's syndrome ( SS ) systemic autoimmune disease characterize chronic inflammation salivary lachrymal gland , frequently accompany systemic symptom . The presence various autoantibody rheumatoid factor ( RF ) anti-SSA/SSB antibody , well hypergammaglobulinemia , reflect B cell hyperactivity . About five percent patient SS develop malignant B cell lymphoma , usually mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) type frequently locate major salivary gland . Currently , lack evidence-based intervention therapy may influence SS-related chronic inflammation lymphoproliferation . B cell involve pathogenesis SS , B cell downregulation may lead decrease disease activity . Patients residual exocrine gland function , e.g. , SS short duration , might better benefit systemic therapy , report preliminary study efficacy B-cell depletion SS.This study examine effect drug Belimumab patient SS . Patients age 18 year SS may eligible study . Candidates screen complete history physical examination , chest x-ray , oral eye examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Phase 2 , proof concept , 52 Week Open Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Belimumab ( HGS1006 , LymphoStat-B ) , Fully Human Monoclonal Anti-BLyS Antibody , Subjects Sjögren 's Syndrome ( pSS ) Clinical Development Phase : 2 A total 15 patient recruited Objectives To evaluate proof concept efficacy belimumab subject SS To evaluate safety tolerability belimumab subject SS This Phase 2 , proof concept , 52-week open study evaluate efficacy safety belimumab subject active SS . In addition receive standard stable therapy , subject receive 10 mg/kg belimumab . At week 28 , worsen patient exit study band consider treatment failure . If disease stable week 28 , referent clinician patient agree continue study , study continue week 52 patient , since delay response may occur ( show systemic lupus erythematosus patient treat belimumab : Chathman et al .
