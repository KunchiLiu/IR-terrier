	<brief_title>Multipolar Radiofrequency Ablation Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Extra Nodular Versus Intranodular Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>206 patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( ) include three nodule measure four cm diameter , randomize two therapeutic leg : multipolar touch radiofrequency versus multipolar intra nodular radiofrequency . Patients previously treat hepatocellular carcinoma enrol study . Diagnostic hepatocellular carcinoma base American Society Liver Diseases guide line . Early response treatment assess one month radiofrequency ablation procedure ( three case incomplete necrosis ) dynamic contrast medium enhance CT MRI liver examination . For follow dynamic contrast medium enhance CT MRI liver examination perform every three month . The trial last 73 month include 45 month recruitment patient . The main criterion judgement 2-years recurrence rate .</detailed_description>
