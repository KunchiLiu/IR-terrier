	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop practice procedure lymphatic drainage mapping intent provide new tool could potentially use radiation treatment planning . High-risk prostate cancer patient schedule treated intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) may eligible enroll study . 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid , radiopharmaceutical ( `` tracer '' ) inject urologist use transrectal ultrasound guidance ( TRUS ) UCSF Urology Clinic . Participants undergo SPECT/CT image UCSF Nuclear Medicine Clinic . This study evaluate feasibility transport patient Nuclear Medicine Clinic image within 1-3 hour administration 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The entire study procedure involve 1 ) preparation 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid , 2 ) administration 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid transrectal ultrasound guidance , 3 ) transfer patient Nuclear Medicine clinic SPECT/CT ( Infinia Hawkeye , GE Healthcare ) imaging , 4 ) tomographically capture distribution 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid uptake patient 's lymphatic drainage site within practical image acquisition time ( 1-3 h postinjection ) consider patient transit time injection image . Administration 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid perform UCSF Urology clinic . The injection perform follow clinically accept method describe European investigator . 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid image utilizes trace amount radioactivity . 100-200 MBq ( 2.7-5.4 mCi ) 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid administer two lobes prostate gland transrectal ultrasound guidance three fraction peripheral central zone prostatic apex , mid portion , base . 1 % Lidocaine may administer local anesthesia per routine clinical protocol deem appropriate performing urologist . The procedure consider feasible practice procedure ( injection completion image ) successfully implement within 3 hour injection ( include patient transport time ) . Imaging consider successful radiotracer qualitatively detect within prostate local lymphatic system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male Age ≥ 18 year Diagnosis definitive highrisk prostate cancer Clinically eligible schedule definitive IMRT treatment pelvic lymph nodal radiation ( study procedure ) At least one follow risk factor : 1 . Pathologically confirm pelvic nodal involvement ; 2 . Enlarged pelvic lymph node ( great 1 cm short axis ) visible CT MRI image , 3 . Greater 15 % risk lymph node involvement calculate use equation : Risk positive node ( % ) = ( 2/3 ) prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) + [ ( Gleason score 6 ) ] × 10 ] . This formula use estimate pathologic stage prostate cancer preoperative prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) Gleason score , adopt many radiation oncology clinic , include radiation oncology physician . Ability give write informed consent willingness comply requirement protocol • Any condition compromise compliance objective procedure protocol , judge principal investigator</criteria>
