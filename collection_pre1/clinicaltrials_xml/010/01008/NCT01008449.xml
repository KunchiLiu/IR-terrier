	<brief_title>Staples Versus Suture Cesarean Wound Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean delivery ( CD ) common surgical procedure 1 million perform annually United States . The rate CD steadily increase . In 2006 , estimate 31.1 % U.S. births CD . Approximately two third primary procedure 90 % CD later undergo repeat cesarean delivery . The rise CD attribute change physician patient expectation , attitude risk , change clinical practice . These include decreased vaginal birth cesarean delivery ( VBAC ) , breech vaginal delivery , operative vaginal delivery well increase maternal request , fail induction labor , elective repeat CD . The CD rate expect rise high 40-50 % next decade increase trend continue unabated . Despite large number CD perform , agree standard skin closure . The commonly used material surgical staple absorbable subcuticular suture . Staples clear benefit decrease operating time . In theory , staple also decrease chance bacterial migration wound , decrease tension incision edge , less damage capillary subcuticular layer skin absorbable subcuticular suture . However , argue staple painful bad cosmetic appearance . This especially case staple remain place longer recommend leave `` track mark . '' Staples also less visually appeal patient . The Cochrane Collaboration identify one randomize control trial ( RCT ) address skin closure CD ( Alderice , 2003 ) . This study include 66 woman compare absorbable subcuticular suture versus surgical staple skin closure CD . Surgical staple shorter operate time absorbable subcuticular suture decrease post-operative pain good cosmesis 6 week post-operative visit ( Frishman , 1997 ) . Rousseau , J. present oppose finding RCT `` A Randomized Study Comparing Subcuticular Sutures Versus Staples Skin Closure Cesarean Sections '' . In study , staple well cosmesis , decrease pain post-operative visit , short operating time ( Rousseau , 2009 ) . Neither study assess wound disruption infection directly . With widely vary finding lack data need identify cesarean section skin closure provide best outcomes common major surgical procedure woman . We undertaken RCT compare surgical staple vs. absorbable subcuticular suture closure skin cesarean section . Our primary outcome composite wound morbidity outcome ( include wound disruption infection ) . Assuming baseline wound morbidity 8 % , Power 80 % , decrease wound morbidity 4 % , sample size 1,204 require . Our secondary outcome include cosmesis , post-operative pain , health service use/cost , procedure time , patient satisfaction . The study terminate recruitment approximately 400 subject administrative review ( see publication : Figueroa et al . Obstet Gynecol . 2013 Jan ; 121 ( 1 ) :33-8 . )</detailed_description>
