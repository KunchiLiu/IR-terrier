	<brief_summary>The researcher ' laboratory study rare class highly recurrent hydatidiform mole . These usually complete hydatidiform mole ( CHM ) , sometimes partial hydatidiform mole PHM ) . With sporadic mole , difference CHMs PHMs CHMS , typically embryo fetus time diagnosis PHM may fetus . Also , CHMs 46 chromosome cell . While number chromosome find , problem chromosome come father . Normally , half chromosome come mother half come father . Unlike CHMs , PHMs 69 chromosome . This mean PHMs three copy chromosome two . The extra copy come father . The researcher ' study focus mole genetically different sporadic mole 23 chromosome mother 23 chromosome father - like normally develop pregnancy . These call biparental mole mutation cause mole come parent . This mutation occur gene call NLRP7 . The researcher ' team work understand mutation NLRP7 lead CHMs mutation may lead type pregnancy loss . The researcher also try discover genetic epigenetic factor may lead mole .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hydatidiform mole ( HM ) product aberrant human pregnancy abnormal embryonic development abnormal proliferation placental villus . The incidence HM vary ethnic group , occur 1 every 1500 pregnancy USA . All HM case sporadic except extremely rare familial case . The exact mechanism lead molar pregnancy know . Hydatidiform moles classify base histology karyotype data two type : complete hydatidiform mole ( CHM ) partial hydatidiform mole ( PHM ) . The complete form characterize general trophoblastic proliferation absence embryo amniotic membrane . In case , CHM diploid genome , androgenetic two identical set paternal chromosome . Partial hydatidiform mole characterize focal trophoblastic proliferation . Embryos amniotic membrane usually present molar pregnancy . Partial hydatidiform mole mostly triploid two set paternal chromosome one set maternal chromosome . The comparison finding androgenetic CHM PHM indicate maternally ( ) express paternally ( ) express gene play role pathophysiology molar pregnancy . Very genetic study perform molar pregnancy patient carry pregnancy . A study look over- underexpression gene may play role progression invasiveness hydatidiform mole ; however none address underlying genetic etiology . We able study inbred family several female member recurrent hydatidiform mole genetically map defective gene responsible molar pregnancy family . We work towards refine characterization genetic locus contain mutate gene analysis candidate gene region mutation lead molar pregnancy . Because hydatidiform mole patient abnormal genetic imprinting , believe candidate gene important establishment genetic imprint maternal germline . Recently , another group investigator study condition identify mutation gene , NALP7 ( rename NLRP7 ) , affected woman . We confirm subject study u . This first identify gene , genetic heterogeneity gene still remain found . In addition , normal function gene reproduction lead recurrent mole mutate remains determine . To study , important collect many molar pregnancy tissue sample possible , well blood sample and/or non-invasively obtain sample , buccal swab saliva , affect patient family . Recent evidence suggest mutation NLRP7 might cause form reproductive failure , triploid spontaneous abortion . It propose mutation status NLRP7 woman recurrent reproductive loss important predictor outcome Assisted Reproductive Technologies . Therefore , carry mutation analysis NLRP2 NLRP7 woman unexplained infertility form reproductive failure .</detailed_description>
