	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test safety oxygen produce gel ( produce combine bake soda hydrogen peroxide ) see effect ( good bad ) skin incision child . Baking soda hydrogen peroxide approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , approve use manner . It hypothesize combination sodium bicarbonate hydrogen peroxide may enhance wound heal incisional wound bilateral hernia repair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wound heal complex regeneration process , characterize degradation re-assembly connective tissue epidermal layer . The pH value within wound-milieu influence indirectly directly biochemical reaction take place process healing . Interestingly , far neglected parameter overall outcome . For three decade common assumption amongst physician low pH value , find normal skin , favorable wound healing . However , investigation show fact heal process take-rate skin-grafts require alkaline milieu . The matter thus much complicate assume . One review draw conclusion wound pH potent influential factor heal process different pH range require certain distinct phase wound heal . Further systematic data need collect well understand pH requirement specific circumstance . This important help develop new pH target therapeutic strategy . Such shift pH accomplish use sodium biocarbonate ( bake soda ) Another common agent use wound treatment hydrogen peroxide . It hypothesize hydrogen peroxide would accelerate reepithelization and/or positive effect infection . However , result use hydrogen peroxide alone appear support hypothesis . ( Table 1 ) However , one report use combination bake soda hydrogen peroxide post-surgical wound healing show significant increase wound heal oral surgery . A randomized , double-blind crossover study involve 25 patient require bilateral maxillary gingival flap surgery complete . The effect twice daily brush bake soda-hydrogen peroxide dentifrice placebo dentifrice observe 28-day post-surgical period . At day 7 14 , soft tissue appearance/wound healing ( STA ) assess base color edema , . Post-surgical wound heal statistically significantly improve day 7 trend continue day 14 sodium bicarbonate-hydrogen peroxide use compare control . Such material show possibly effective aid early phase heal follow gingival flap surgery . It determine combination product may increase oxygen content wound site .</detailed_description>
