	<brief_summary>FB-7 Phase II , multi-center randomize study neratinib combination weekly paclitaxel without trastuzumab follow doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) neoadjuvant therapy woman HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer . Patients control arm receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab combination weekly paclitaxel follow AC . The primary aim study determine pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate breast axillary node follow neoadjuvant therapy regimen . The secondary aim include determination pCR rate breast , clinical complete response ( cCR ) rate , two-year recurrence-free interval , two-year overall survival , toxicity neoadjuvant regimen , exploration molecular genetic correlate response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Randomized Trial Evaluating Neoadjuvant Therapy With Neratinib and/or Trastuzumab Followed Postoperative Trastuzumab Women With Locally Advanced HER2-positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sequential AC follow taxane initiate concurrently trastuzumab become standard care United States operable HER2-positive breast cancer follow initial surgery . Trastuzumab , recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody extracellular domain HER2 protein , develop block HER2 signaling pathway show substantially improve efficacy chemotherapy woman metastatic early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer . However , patient develop recurrence succumb disease follow trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy . Evaluation additional approach target pathway show promising result trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer . Neratinib ( HKI-272 ) , orally administer small molecule , irreversible inhibitor pan ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase , distinguishes small molecule lapatinib . Because high degree homology kinase domains EGFR HER2 , neratinib inhibits EGFR HER2 function . Neratinib design block kinase activity bind ATP site enzyme . In BT474 cell line , HKI-272 effectively repress phosphorylation MAPK Akt signal transduction pathway , whereas trastuzumab fail completely inhibit HER2 receptor phosphorylation downstream signal event . In tumor xenograft overexpress HER2 , neratinib observe repress tumor growth dose-dependent manner . A comparison overall response rate lapatinib neratinib comparable patient , albeit separate Phase II study , suggest favorable efficacy neratinib monotherapy trastuzumab-refractory patient ( response rate 5.1 % vs. 26 % ) trastuzumab-na√Øve patient ( response rate 24 % vs. 56 % ) . Taken together , data support rationale small molecule TKI may efficacious trastuzumab neoadjuvant setting , neratinib may active lapatinib . The study start two-arm design randomization control arm ( Arm 1 ) investigational arm ( Arm 2 ) 1:2 ratio . With addition second investigation arm , ( Arm 3 ) , study become three-arm design 1:1:1 allocation ratio ( equal number patient randomize Arms 1 , 2 , 3 ) . The sample size 126 patient 42 evaluable patient arm . Patients enter trial treat reason replace . Accrual expect occur 18 month . Patients randomize one three neoadjuvant therapy regimen : Patients Arm 1 receive 4 cycle paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administer Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . Trastuzumab begin concurrently paclitaxel give weekly total 16 dos ( 4 mg/kg load dose , 2 mg/kg weekly ) . Following paclitaxel/trastuzumab , standard AC administer every 21 day 4 cycle ; Patients Arm 2 receive 4 cycle paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administer Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . Neratinib 240 mg take orally daily begin Day 1 paclitaxel continue Day 28 final cycle paclitaxel . Standard AC administer every 21 day 4 cycle administer follow paclitaxel/neratinib therapy ; Patients Arm 3 receive 4 cycle paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administer Days 1 , 8 , 15 28 day cycle trastuzumab , begin concurrently paclitaxel , give weekly total 16 dos ( 4 mg/kg load dose , 2 mg/kg weekly ) . Neratinib 200 mg take orally daily begin Day 1 paclitaxel continue Day 28 final cycle paclitaxel . Standard AC administer every 21 day 4 cycle follow paclitaxel/trastuzumab/neratinib therapy . In arm , clinical response assess palpation chemotherapy regimens prior surgery . Following recovery surgery , trastuzumab ( 8 mg/kg load dose , 6 mg/kg ) administer every 3 week complete 1 year target therapy ( either preoperative trastuzumab therapy neratinib therapy ) . Patients receive adjuvant radiation therapy endocrine therapy clinically indicate . At time local IRB approval amendment # 6 , submission fresh tumor sample FB-7 correlative science study optional patient . For patient agree , core biopsy procedure procure three fresh tumor sample perform randomization ( patient sign consent form screen eligibility ) . Submission tumor block diagnostic core biopsy sample tumor block gross residual disease great equal 1.0 cm , find surgical specimen , require . In addition , blood sample collect randomization ( start study therapy ) also require correlative science study . Beginning Amendment # 8 , Arm 1 Arm 2 close accrual US subsequent FDA approval pertuzumab give combination trastuzumab neoadjuvant therapy breast cancer . Pertuzumab trastuzumab target therapy drug . US patient enrol study randomize place combine targeted therapy group , Arm 3 , . Randomization study therapy patient enter via institution outside US remain unchanged .</detailed_description>
