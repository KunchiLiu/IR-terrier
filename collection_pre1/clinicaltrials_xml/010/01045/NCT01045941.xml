	<brief_summary>We believe laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy cancer allow quick recovery significantly reduce chance postoperative wound breakdown . This shorten wait time require begin adjuvant therapy one week surgery thereby combat micrometastasis unseen time surgery . Prognosis patient pancreatic cancer therefore improve along decrease incidence locoregional recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Adjuvant Gemcitabine Started One Week After Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine-based chemoÂ¬therapy remain cornerstone treatment locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . Other novel chemotherapeutic combination investigate clinical trial , overall conclusion agent fail improve outcome . Our hypothesis nodal hematologic micrometastasis make pancreas cancer systemic problem time surgery . Waiting traditional six week begin adjuvant therapy allow aggressive cancer metastasize patient wait begin therapy . This lead increased incidence locoregional recurrence poor prognosis . We believe laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy cancer allow quick recovery significantly reduce chance postoperative wound breakdown . This shorten wait time require begin adjuvant therapy one week surgery thereby combat micrometastasis unseen time surgery . Prognosis patient pancreatic cancer therefore improve along decrease incidence locoregional recurrence . Methods : We perform prospective , non-randomized phase II study patient undergo laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy pancreatic adenocarcinoma Johns Hopkins Hospital . Gemcitabine give single-agent chemotherapy regimen one week follow laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy accord protocol design medical oncologist . Six cycle gemcitabine give . The patient follow medical oncology clinic weekly . Our Primary outcome variable cause postoperative morbidity . Our sample size small ( 6-10 patient ) Phase II study . Early termination rule include development prohibitive toxicity death . Our endpoint improvement overall survival , quality life , progression free survival , disease free survival . Exclusion criterion include patient T4 M1 disease , R2 resection margin , preoperative therapy , adjuvant therapy status unknown .</detailed_description>
