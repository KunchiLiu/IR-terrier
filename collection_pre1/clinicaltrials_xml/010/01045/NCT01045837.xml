	<brief_summary>Withdrawal gluten , culprit antigen , definite treatment celiac disease . Weeks month gluten withdrawal diet clinical manifestation , histological feature start improve . Many adult patient critical phase even week may matter especially adolescence height growth limit potential . Suppression immune system use short course steroid might retard immune mediate destruction villus effect gluten withdrawal set . Steroids know effective management refractory celiac disease . Therefore , investigator hypothesize addition short course steroid gluten free diet may enhance intestinal mucosal recovery thus clinical manifestation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Celiac disease chronic systemic autoimmune disorder induce gluten protein present wheat , barley , rye . Steroids affect proliferative response B T cell vitro , production lymphokine ( migratory inhibitory factor ) culture cell . Steroids inhibit effect gluten proteins action element immune system . Glucocorticoids reserve severely ill patient , present celiac crisis , gliadin shock , refractory sprue . We hypothesize addition short course steroid gluten free diet may enhance intestinal mucosal recovery thus clinical manifestation .</detailed_description>
