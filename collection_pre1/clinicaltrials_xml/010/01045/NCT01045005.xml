	<brief_summary>The investigator aim show quantitative analysis doppler flow velocity waveforms i.e . ultrasound non−invasive safe mean assess blood flow ; record proximity terminal microvascular bed interest , ( i.e . forearm ocular circulation ) sensitively detect track local change microvascular haemodynamics i.e . function small blood vessel find back eye forearm . The investigator also aim relate change doppler spectral flow velocity waveform i.e . ultrasound signal , central retinal artery change geometry tone vasculature ( change structure function small blood vessel ) response inhale oxygen carbon dioxide . The geometry tone vasculature ( Blood Vessels ) measure take photograph back eye .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus significantly increase risk small large blood vessel complication e.g . diabetic eye problem coronary heart disease . Vital organ eye , kidney , heart brain represent well− recognize preferential target patient diabetes mellitus . The presence end−organ damage powerfully influence cardiovascular risk benefit therapeutic intervention . Unfortunately , time symptom develop event occur manifestation target−organ damage , disease process already advanced stage . Although traditionally view end−organ , alter structure function arterial small blood vessel act substrate accelerated disease development increase occurrence vascular event patient diabetes mellitus . The ability detect monitor sub−clinical damage , represent cumulative integrate influence risk factor impair arterial wall integrity , hold potential refine cardiovascular risk stratification enable early intervention prevent attenuate disease progression . Data derive analysis arterial waveform , mark presence impair pulsatile function arterial system , show predict future cardiovascular risk . As consistent abnormality arterial pulse wave shape recognize many year diabetic subject grow interest quantifying change pulse contour provide information status vasculature diabetes . These original observation confirm recent study patient type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus detect prior development clinical complication disease . Analysis pulse contour record site large conduit artery identify structural functional abnormality predominantly systemic microvasculature , small artery arteriole recognise major site wave reflection alters pulse contour morphology . It recognise technique provide global assessment circulation may capture localise finding specific site target−organ interest arterial system . Microcirculation collective term small segment vascular system major site control vascular resistance . It include arteriole capillary consider continuum rather distinct site resistance control . Importantly , recognise site early manifestation cardiovascular disease , especially inflammatory process occur . The microvasculature may therefore constitute preferential target primarily involve pathogenesis disease represent important regional target therapeutic intervention . Further , retinal photography standardise grade provide unique opportunity study retinal microvascular characteristic include retinopathy change arteriolar ( blood vessel ) structure function . Improved method assessment study retinal microvascular network hold potential improve prediction risk , identify high risk group act window monitor effect possible drug intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible study patient must older 18 year . All patient undergone extensive clinical evaluation perform Belfast City Hospital diabetes clinic include retinal photography . Patients eligible study stable control diabetes haemoglobin A1c 6.5 10 % . Patients eligible background retinopathy . The control subject healthy individual ; age sex match disease population . Patients proliferative retinopathy undergo laser therapy exclude study . This would make assessment retinal arteriolar structure difficult . Patients also exclude hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 140/90mmHg ) take antihypertensive drug . The investigator know presence hypertension effect retinal waveform structure . Patients also exclude significant renal disease ( GFR &lt; 60ml min ) history cardiovascular cerebrovascular complication . Patients microalbuminuria ( &gt; 3 g/min ) include study would ask stop medication ( e.g . ACE inhibitor ) 5 day prior study period . It mention risk associate stop effective medication period time minimal . This common practice department number previous study , publish literature . This clearly communicated patient patient information sheet , patient consent form ; discussion/process obtain informed consent patient</criteria>
