	<brief_summary>We use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) investigate tumor change woman breast cancer receive anthracycline-based systemic chemotherapy . We also use MRI cognitive test study possible effect chemotherapy brain woman . The result compare control group normal healthy woman . We try determine MRI use predict tumor response cognitive change relate chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In work utilize conventional magnetic resonance image well set advanced magnetic resonance imaging tool investigate change tumor physiology human brain result anthracycline-based systemic chemotherapy . We recruit 15 subject diagnose breast cancer prepare anthracycline-based systemic chemotherapy regimen . Each subject undergo set MR imaging tool therapy , one therapy session , four therapy session , conclusion therapy . Conventional MRI method use quantify tumor-response chemotherapy subject . A control group 15 normal subject also recruit undergo MR brain imaging twice gap 6 month scan . All subject also undergo battery neuropsychological test image session . The result neuropsychological test use quantify cognitive change subject . A final analysis determine advance MR modality use predict response tumor human cognition chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
