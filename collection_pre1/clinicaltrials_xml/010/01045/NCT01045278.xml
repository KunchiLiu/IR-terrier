	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C lead cause chronic liver disease industrialized country , common indication liver transplantation . In Western world , absolute majority case Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection relate use injectable narcotic drug . Most injecting drug user contract HCV infection within first year start inject drug use . The aim study study hepatitis C cohort patient register clinic provide maintenance therapy opiate dependence three metropolitan area Sweden . The cohort define patient register three clinic date study initiation . The study contain four part : Part I : first part study aim evaluate prevalence HCV exposure cohort proportion anti-HCV positive participant chronic infection . Part II : Patients chronic HCV infection offer investigation chronic liver disease , include liver biopsy , selection candidate antiviral therapy identification risk factor development severe liver disease . Part III : Based result investigation , patient consider antiviral therapy . Indications therapy mainly clinical and/or histological sign chronic liver disease fibrosis . All patient receive weight-based dos pegylated interferon-alfa-2b ribavirin . Part IV : Study pharmacokinetic interaction ribavirin opiate substitution molecule ( methadone buprenorphine ) patient receive antiviral therapy accord part III .</brief_summary>
