	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To assess objective response rate ( ORR ) iniparib ( SAR240550 ) administer 60min intravenous ( IV ) infusion twice weekly weekly , combination gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy regimen patient metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer ( mTNBC ) . Secondary Objectives : - To assess clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) define rate complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) last least 24 week ; - To assess Progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) ; - To assess safety profile schedule iniparib ; - To assess biological activity tumor tissue ( substudy ) ; - To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile iniparib ( substudy ) ; - To characterize molecular biological profile tumor ( substudy ) ; - To assess effect iniparib poly ( ADP ) -ribose ( PAR ) level peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) ( substudy ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration study patient include period inclusion 3 week . The patient may continue treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity consent withdrawal , follow minimum 30-day follow-up last study treatment administration . In case discontinuation study treatment , patient consider withdrawn study treatment , follow plan least 30 day last administration study treatment safety purpose . In case study treatment discontinuation without disease progression , efficacy data collect every 6 week disease progression , death end study whatever come first . After disease progression , patient followed-up every 12 week ( 3 month ) overall survival death end study . The patient benefit study treatment continue disease progression , toxicity willingness stop .</detailed_description>
