	<detailed_description>Design trial The data report study derive cognitive test determination humoral growth factor time survey 1 ( recruitment phase ) . To determine whether extensive endurance training enhances cognitive ability elderly , plan compare longitudinally outcomes various neuropsychological test humoral marker elderly marathon runner bicyclists control match age , sex , year education time survey 2 ( 5-year follow-up ) time survey 3 ( 10-year follow-up ) . Runners participate 2008 Wachau half marathon ( 21,2 km ) Vienna City marathon ( 42,5 km ) well bicyclists participate Corinthian marathon ( 180km ) recruit assistance organizer via personal contact . Runners bicyclist eligible inclusion study ( ) participate least one 3 marathon precede two year , ( b ) still continuous train recruitment phase ( least 2 hours/week ) ( c ) age 60 . Exclusion criterion ( ) present past exposure neurotoxic substance ( b ) speak German native language ( verbal intelligence ) ( c ) diseases markedly affect CNS function : example , cerebrovascular stroke , brain tumor , depression , Alzheimer 's disease , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , etc . ( ) manifest cardiovascular disease , ( e ) chronic alcoholism ( daily alcohol intake &gt; 60 g diagnose history alcoholism ) ( f ) unwillingness give inform consent . Controls subsequently contact via personal contact three additional advertisement ( two Austrian newspaper ( `` Krone '' ) one Austrian bicyclist journal ( `` Bicyclist Sports '' ) . The control match accord age , sex year education . Detailed information education , smoke habit , family history , exercise training medication obtain . All participant extensive medical evaluation carry experienced internal specialist include blood withdrawal enter study . Since show humoral growth factor level vary circadian rhythm , examination start 10 10.30 . In case examination reveal neurological abnormality , participant additionally examine neurologist . Besides physical examination blood withdrawal describe , study protocol include ergometry , neuropsychological testing , use set questionnaire magnetic resonance imaging . All participant underwent study protocol test above-mentioned chronological order . The study approve ethic committee medical faculty University Vienna ( number EK 401/2005 ) . All subject give write informed consent enter study . Procedures follow accordance institutional guideline . Ergometry Individual work capacity calculate percentage predict ( =100 % work load ) Watt value ( derive tabulation , standardize sex , age , body surface [ 28 ] ) . Briefly , workload increase every two minute step 25 W , begin 25 W go point exhaustion ( Ergoline , Ergometrics 900 ) . The individual physical working capacity ( PWC ) express individual maximal power ( Watt ) max percent reference value ( Wattref ) : PWCind = 100 x Wattmax/Wattref [ 28 ] . Neuropsychological testing questionnaires The Vienna Neuropsychological Test Battery ( VNTB ) well Consortium Establish Registry Alzheimer 's Disease ( CERAD ) select order ass cognitive function , visuo-construction , concentration/attention , language , memory executive functioning domain . These cognitive ability know commonly affected Alzheimer 's disease dementia . The two battery test find sensitive evaluation mild cognitive impairment . Each test run begin screen global cognitive function via Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) Clock Drawing Test . Thereafter participant subject cognitive test assess visuo-constructional ability , attention , language function , memory executive function . Details cognitive testing describe Appendix . After finish test battery , subject ask fill several self-rating scale form assess premorbid intelligence level , subjective memory function , psychological physiological well-being , depression , activity daily life . Laboratory procedure Blood count , clinical chemistry test , vitamin B12 folic acid , thyroid hormone HbA1c determination perform accord standard routine laboratory testing procedure . As preanalytical factor crucially affect level growth factor , collection processing specimen carry strictly standardize condition . Whole blood DNA extraction serum sample growth factor measurement store -80°C within MedUni Vienna Biobank facility . Post-storage isolation DNA do Corbett X-tractor Gene CAS 1820 semi-automated nucleic acid extraction system ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) use Macherey Nagel Nucleospin 96 blood kit ( Macherey Nagel , Dueren , Germany ) . Quantification genomic DNA Warburg-Christian method ( 260/280 nm ) Nanodrop spectrophotometer ( PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH , Erlangen , Germany ) reveal average nucleic acid concentration 25 ng/µL . ApoE genotyping 1:10 ( v/v Buffer BE , Macherey Nagel ) dilute aliquot perform ABI TaqMan® 7900HT Real Time ( RT ) -PCR thermocycler ( Applied Biosystems , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) . For , pre-designed TaqMan SNP-Genotyping assay distinguish ApoE ε4 allele ε2 ε3 amino acid position 112 ( ApoE rs429358 , Assay ID C_3084793_20 , Applied Biosystems ) ApoE ε2 allele ε3 ε4 amino acid position 158 ( rs7412 , Assay ID C_904973_10 , Applied Biosystems ) purchase .
