	<brief_summary>Basal arthritis thumb common condition increase prevalence post-menopausal woman , obese person , elderly . Surgical option vary efficacious , patient candidate surgery . The success pitfalls previous , similar trial carefully consider creation . Though steroid injection standard care basal joint arthritis , current data support efficacy beyond placebo effect . No trial yet examine efficacy botulinum toxin type A ( BTX-A ) injection basal thumb joint compare steroid . Since efficacy steroid questionable best , hope BTX-A injection basal joint might next great tool treat common , debilitating disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : Basal joint arthritis , carpometacarpal ( CMC ) osteoarthritis , thumb common , particularly elderly . Morbidities include pain , decrease range motion , decreased strength . Nonsurgical treatment CMC arthritis include oral analgesic , splint , steroid injection . In multiple recent trial , botulinum toxin A ( BTX-A ) injection show efficacious nonsurgical option osteoarthritis large joint , include fail steroid injection . To knowledge , efficacy BTX-A injection thumb CMC arthritis examine . Methods : Patients clinical radiographic diagnosis basal joint arthritis appropriate willing candidate injection therapy select . The primary symptom indicate need injection would pain controlled conservative measure ( e.g . nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , splint , physical therapy , etc . ) Weakness impair functioning also consider . Exclusion criterion include injection within last 12 month surgical treatment . All patient undergo Eaton stag radiographically prior treatment . Informed consent obtain patient randomly assign one three group . One group receive BTX-A injection , second group receive triamcinolone plus lidocaine injection , third group receive saline plus lidocaine injection thumb CMC joint . Prior treatment , patient ' baseline function assess pinch , grip , range motion measurement , affect disease measure visual analog pain scale Disabilities Arm , Shoulder , Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire . Pain scale DASH questionnaire complete twenty-four hour , ten day , twelve week , six month , one year treatment . Pain scale record average pain maximum pain . Clinical evaluation pinch , grip , range motion measurement occur ten day , twelve week , six month , one year treatment . All patient ask return sufficient symptom recur warrant treatment . Expected Results : We hypothesize BTX-A injection equal good efficacy steroid injection treatment basal joint arthritis . Expected Conclusion : No study date examine BTX-A treatment basal joint arthritis . Some patient surgical candidate reliant non-surgical treatment pain control maintenance function . BTX-A show effective treat osteoarthritis large joint undergo frequent use , include case resistant steroid injection . The basal thumb joint also undergoes frequent use often resistant steroid injection . We believe BTX-A provide another efficacious non-surgical option treatment CMC joint thumb . We estimate study require approximately three four year achieve adequate patient number group .</detailed_description>
