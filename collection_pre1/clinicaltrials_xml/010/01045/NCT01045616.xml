	<detailed_description>Improved neonatal care result reduced mortality preterm infant , especially low birth weight extremely low birth weight group . However , reduce mortality associate long-term medical sequela . For example , preterm infant increase risk chronic illnesses cerebral palsy asthma , well poor motor skill , poor adaptive functioning , low intelligence quotient . As ophthalmic problem , ophthalmic challenge follow preterm birth numerous morbid ocular condition rare . The threat visual development prematurity end retina fully vascularise risk ROP pass . The risk blindness baby birth weight &lt; 1500 g increase 25 time compare child bear full term . The condition result severe visual loss include ROP , cerebral vision impairment , cataracts optic atrophy , whereas condition , primarily amblyopia , may result good visual outcome . Effects prematurity ocular neurological development include retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) , refractive error , strabismus , cerebral visual impairment , colour vision deficit , reduce contrast sensitivity ( CS ) , visual field defect , decrease visual acuity ( VA ) . Many factor independent . Among , refractive error really common disorder . These cause significant disability impact life 's activity , quality . There numerous report increase refractive error amblyogenic factor low birth weight population relative child bear full term . However , formal database establish Taiwan . Today Taiwan , increase level educational living standard , prevalence severity myopia refractive error appear upward trend . The rate much high developed country genetic environmental factor crucial . Under special condition , tendency increase refractive error amblyogenic factor low birth weight child questionable need effort identify . Currently , standard guideline available toward provision ophthalmic follow care preterm infant . For preterm child bear Taiwan , time discharge neonatal unit national screen 6-7 year age ( receive education elementary school ) , routine ophthalmic surveillance . Due concern life 's activity qualities child , important survey prevalence different ophthalmic sequela Taiwan , identify risk factor develop sequela , , furthermore , build screen program . The preterm population heterogeneous condition develop ophthalmic sequela . To use limited health service resource efficiently , would helpful identify high risk develop ophthalmic sequela . National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) , one large tertiary medical center northern Taiwan , charge big part intense care low birth weight preterm neonate . With detailed medical record do child care neonatal unit , competence meaningful program .</detailed_description>
