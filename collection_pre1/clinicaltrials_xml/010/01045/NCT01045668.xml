	<brief_title>Ablation Clinical Ventricular Tachycardia Versus Addition Substrate Ablation Long Term Success Rate VT Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : VT find mostly patient structural heart disease . It classify use morphological criterion ( monomorphic polymorphic ) , duration arrhythmia ( sustain non-sustained ) mechanism arrhythmia formation ( re-entry , increase automation trigger activity ) . The therapeutic approach prognostic estimate different type VT depend great degree mechanistic basis disease well extent myocardial damage success therapy measure absence recurrence . Myocardial infarction subsequent induction VT observe consequence coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The infarct region morphologically electrically diseased arrhythmogenic may form substrate macro-reentrant VT . Although antiarrhythmic drug remain primary form therapy VT , non-pharmacologic technique like implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) catheter ablation ( CA ) become increasingly popular advancement technology well increase desire among patient eliminate arrhythmia ablation rather suppress drug . ICDs CA effectively terminate VT short-term basis ; multiple morphology , hemodynamic instability non-inducibility limit long-term success rate CA . The 'substrate mapping ' approach defines area ventricular scar potential VT source . Several study small group patient show successful ablation VT substrates either reduces recurrence VT 19- 50 % reduces frequency recurrence well requirement anti-arrhythmic drug ( AADs ) . Study design : This study multicenter , randomize , open label , parallel-arm clinical trial . A total 120 post-myocardial infarction patient randomize 1:1 ratio 2 group : 1. ablation target clinically present VT site early activation , 2. ablation target clinically present VT site early activation plus substrate-based RF ablation Follow-up : Patients undergo ICD interrogation 3 , 6 12 month collect VT episode data , VT symptom assessment , complication assessment AAD record . Management AADs discretion physician .</detailed_description>
