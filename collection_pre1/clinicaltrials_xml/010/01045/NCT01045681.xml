	<brief_summary>The present trial design phase II study aim estimate efficacy combination bendamustine , bortezomib dexamethasone relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . The response rate , i.e . rate patient achieve Complete Response Partial Response cycle 4 , divide total intent treat patient number choose primary efficacy endpoint . The estimation efficacy rate base explorative pilot study , since immediate embark large-scale comparative efficacy trial would acceptable point view resource . Moreover , would induce ethical objection , seem justifiable expose large number patient experimental approach without sufficient exploratory indication improve risk-benefit ratio .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After relapse early progression first-line treatment , prognosis multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient unfavourable , search new treatment regimen , include drug novel mechanism action essential . Bendamustine bortezomib show high activity boch first-line regimen pre-treated patient . The novel mechanism action proteasome inhibitor non-cross resistance bendamustine alkylating agent establish first-line treatment multiple myeloma seem recommend combination two drug salvage therapy ( second-line regimen ) . Finally , promise response data series relapse MM patient treat bendamustine , bortezomib prednisone support assumption , well feasibility tolerability combination . In summary , evidence favorable risk/benefit ratio combination bendamustine , bortezomib corticoid drug , warrant exploration large , prospectively design multicenter phase II study .</detailed_description>
