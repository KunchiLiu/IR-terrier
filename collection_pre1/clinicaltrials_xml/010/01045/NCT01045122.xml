	<brief_summary>Overview Protocol : Between Subject - Repeated Measures design use assess airway response two group subject two different sedate condition . Each group comprise six subject categorize accord baseline profile risk SDB ( &lt; 10 RDI &gt; 25 RDI ) . Some subject prescribe continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy treat physician result overnight sleep study . CPAP treatment effective splint airway open thus decrease incident airway collapse sleep . Thus , CPAP utilization also track independent continuous variable regular CPAP use find associate increased resistance UAC ( upper airway collapse ) . The experimental condition evaluate upper airway patency instability response two form intravenous sedation : propofol dexmedetomidine . Subjects continuously monitor experimental condition respiratory effort flow , EEG , EMG , ECG . Respiratory instability first assessed subject sedation without airway provocation . The degree respiratory instability quantify term follow measurement : modify Respiratory Disturbance Index ( RDIsedated ) , respiratory arousal , minute ventilation . The apneic period classify mixture central obstructive components.All outcome measurement assess period sedation last approximately one hour . Upper airway patency quantify term critical pharyngeal pressure ( Pcrit ) ( pressure beyond complete upper airway collapse occur , see background ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propensity experience sleep disordered-breathing ( SDB ) control interplay anatomic factor ( i.e . BMI , neck circumference , retrognathia ) neurological drive ( sleep stage , arousal ) . The interaction baseline anatomic factor drug-induced altered neurologic drive may also convey risk upper airway collapse ( UAC ) patient receive analgesic , sedation/anesthesia.1 ; 2 While mainly anecdotal evidence support proposition SDB strong predictor sedation-related adverse events,3 ; 4 remarkable consensus opinion regard association , example , American Society Anesthesiologists develop guideline specifically address issue manage group `` risk '' patient undergo sedation anesthesia . SDB term use describe spectrum sleep-related breathing disturbance . Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) condition incorporate SDB daytime symptom ( i.e . hypersomnolence ) . These term commonly use interchangeably . At juncture , need clear demonstration : 1 ) SDB confers risk sedation-related adverse event ( epidemiologically and/or experimentally ) , 2 ) patient drug factor moderate/mediate risk , 3 ) mechanism responsible patient drug interaction . This propose project , preliminary way , address first second issue . Specifically , upper airway characteristic patient different severity classification SDB assess influence two , neuropharmacologically distinct , intravenous sedative .</detailed_description>
