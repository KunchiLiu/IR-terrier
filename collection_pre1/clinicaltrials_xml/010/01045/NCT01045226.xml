	<brief_title>Proton Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Feasibility proton radiation therapy ( RT ) use standard fractionation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine freedom failure ( FFF ) ( vs. biochemical/clinical progression-free survival ) standard fractionation . II . To determine incidence grade 2 great GU GI toxicity regimen 6 month , 2 year 3 year . III . To assess quality life issue follow completion radiation therapy 6 month 2 year . IV . To assess incidence impotence use proton therapy 3 year . V. To determine freedom biochemical failure ( BF ) 5 year . VI . To determine clinical failure : local and/or distant 5 year . VII . To determine salvage androgen deprivation ( SAD ) use 5 year . VIII . To determine progression free survival : use clinical , biochemical SAD event 5 year . IX . To determine overall survival 5 year . X . To determine disease-specific survival 5 year . XI . Estimate prostate normal structure movement RT use scan . XII . Correlate pathologic radiologic finding outcomes 5 year . XIII . Correlate PSA free PSA level outcomes 5 year . XIV . Correlate testosterone level variation proton therapy outcomes 5 year . XV . Develop quality assurance process proton prostate therapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo proton radiotherapy daily 5 day week approximately 9 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
