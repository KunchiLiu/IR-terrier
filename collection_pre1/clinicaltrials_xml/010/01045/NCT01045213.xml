	<brief_summary>Integrated eHealth innovative , proactive approach management patient chronic cardiopulmonary disease . Our overall goal improve health patient integrate guideline-based education , remote disease monitoring , coordinator-based disease management healthcare provider-initiated therapy . Patients enrolled program receive set equipment , include Health Buddy® telemonitor connects normal telephone , well instrument measure oxygen level ( pulse oximeter ) , lung function ( spirometer ) activity ( pedometer ) . Through Health Buddy® patient receive guideline-based disease education home . The Health Buddy® also allow patient transmit daily information symptom , oxygen level , lung function ability walk program coordinator locate University Colorado Hospital . Our program coordinator highly experienced nurse respiratory therapist expertise management chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Through remote disease education/monitoring program , patient learn take active role management disease . However , coordinator identify early warning sign potential problem , patient contact connected primary healthcare provider early intervention . By integrated approach care , patient learn self-management technique , physician communication enhance , early intervention problem possible . We propose target Integrated eHealth Program area Colorado highly impact COPD . Key Objectives : The key objective improve COPD care 16 Colorado county high COPD mortality rate . Target Population : We target patient severe severe COPD . Expected Outcomes : We expect study increase use evidence-based guideline screen , diagnosis treatment COPD , result improve quality-of-life reduction healthcare utilization .</brief_summary>
