	<brief_summary>Rosacea chronic skin disorder sign symptoms facial flushing , persistent redness , small visible spider-like vein , papule ( inflame red bump skin ) pustule . Rosacea also recur skin disorder . In addition cause uncomfortable embarrass physical symptom flush , burning , itch , rosacea also contribute low self-esteem , significant psychosocial impact quality life . Rosacea flare trigger every day factor sun exposure , heat , hot caffeinated drink , alcoholic beverage , spice stress . Many currently available treatment rosacea partially effective patient respond , unable tolerate side effect . This single-center , open label trial Apremilast ten ( 10 ) subject moderate severe inflammatory rosacea treat Apremilast 20 mg twice per day 12 week . Following screening period baseline visit , study subject return week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 . There follow study visit week 16 . Recent research show increase specific proinflammatory cytokine biopsy inflammatory lesion rosacea acne patient . The cytokine trigger chain chemical response body likely result development papule pustule see rosacea acne patient . Apremilast oral agent modulate multiple anti-inflammatory pathway pharmacodynamic property potential therapeutic benefit treat inflammatory autoimmune disorder . The investigator therefore propose pilot study evaluate potential Apremilast improve sign symptoms moderate severe inflammatory rosacea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center , open label pilot study Apremilast ten subject erythematotelangiectatic rosacea papulopustular rosacea subject treat Apremilast 20mg twice per day 12 week . There total 10 visit period 16 week . Adult male female subject 18 year age old participate study objective , method , potential hazard study fully explain , sign informed consent form . Subjects must diagnosis finding consistent erythematotelangiectatic papulopustular rosacea . Subjects must least 10 papulopustular lesion underlie erythema/telangiectasias visible unassisted naked eye . Subjects take Apremilast capsule 20mg twice per day 12 week . If anytime study subject encounter overt study medication relate adverse effect , dose reduction allow following discussion subject investigator . Dose reduction 20mg per day allow subject experience intolerable adverse effect study medication . If subject tolerate 20mg per day , he/she terminate study .</detailed_description>
