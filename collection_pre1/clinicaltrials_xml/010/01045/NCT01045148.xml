	<detailed_description>Brachytherapy form treatment radioactive isotope implant directly tumor volume deliver lethal dose radiation . High Dose Rate ( HDR ) Prostate brachytherapy particularly elegant brachytherapy dose sculpt method effectively use curative treatment prostate cancer ; however , require hospital admission many temporarily implant transperineal catheter deliver radiation source target volume , result significant patient discomfort . CyberKnife delivers form radiation treatment precise , appear capable reconstruct HDR prostate radiation dose sculpting , without hospital admission without catheter . The CyberKnife device also use classic radiosurgery , accuracy comparable Gamma Knife , unlike Gamma Knife , capability target lesion anywhere body similar accuracy . The aim study compare CyberKnife morbidity efficacy HDR local treatment method permanent seed prostate brachytherapy treatment prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
