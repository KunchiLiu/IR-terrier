	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lenalidomide may stop growth cancer block blood flow tumor . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving lenalidomide together rituximab may effective treatment B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together rituximab maintenance therapy treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide And Rituximab Maintenance Therapy Treating Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study originally intend Phase I/Phase II terminate early toxicity treatment therefore never move Phase II portion study . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) safety lenalidomide combination rituximab subject B-cell NHL follow ASCT . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate tolerability maintenance therapy lenalidomide rituximab ASCT subject B-cell NHL . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival subject B-cell NHL receive maintenance therapy lenalidomide rituximab ASCT . II . To examine whether potential effect lenalidomide rituximab progression-free survival ASCT , compare historical control , vary accord histologic subtype B-cell NHL . III . To correlate potential association peripheral blood level lymphocyte subset include NK , T , B cell progression-free survival ASCT enrol subject . IV . To evaluate potential association progression-free survival ASCT polymorphism position 158 FCgammaRIIIa receptor enrol subject . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21of course rituximab IV day 1of course 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
