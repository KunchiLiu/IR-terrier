	<brief_title>The Effect Dexamethasone Cortisol Levels Patients Undergoing Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose To examine effect dexamethasone , plasma cortisol level , postoperative pain , nausea vomit patient undergo thyroid surgery . Hypothesis That dexamethasone administer induction anesthesia result reduce plasma cortisol level , postoperative pain , nausea vomiting . Justification Dexamethasone synthetic steroid medication use routinely prevent nausea vomit patient undergo general anesthetic . Administration exogenous steroid suppress production endogenous steroid include cortisol . Currently , data exists describe degree suppression cortisol production single preoperative dose dexamethasone . This information would guide physician prescribe dexamethasone perioperative period . Objectives To compare plasma cortisol level patient receive dexamethasone versus placebo induction anesthesia . To investigate effect dexamethasone postoperative pain , nausea vomit . Research Methods A prospective , randomize , control , double-blinded study conduct single center . Thirty patient recruit randomly assign dexamethasone placebo group , accordance sample size calculation . A placebo group necessary eliminate effect potential confounding factor . Statistical Analysis An interim analysis conduct confirm sample size calculation . Plasma cortisol level analyze use 2-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Secondary outcome measure analyze appropriate parametric nonparametric method .</detailed_description>
