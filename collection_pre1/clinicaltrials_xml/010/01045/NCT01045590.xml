	<brief_summary>Rationale Rosiglitazone troglitazone promote differentiation pre-adipocytes adipocytes subcutaneous , omental fat , reduce gamma glutamyl transferase , surrogate marker intra-abdominal hepatic fat . Troglitazone show abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan reduce intra-abdominal adipose tissue area type 2 diabetic . Similarly rosiglitazone also show increase subcutaneous intra-abdominal fat patient type 2 diabetes . In study also show cause substantial reduction hepatic fat . Central fat depot believe associated cardiovascular risk subcutaneous fat depot . By contrast , sulphonylurea-associated weight gain show abdominal CT scan include increase intra-abdominal adipose tissue . The aim study compare body fat distribution pattern glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone versus glibenclamide placebo ( especially intra-abdominal adipose tissue abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue area ) patient type 2 diabetes . It hypothesise rosiglitazone lead accumulation excess energy store subcutaneous rather intra-abdominal adipose tissue depot . In addition , hop positive effect diastolic blood pressure , lipid level , BMI , rosiglitazone show well cardiovascular risk profile use combination glibenclamide rather glibenclamide use alone . Although insulin resistance show primary defect cause type 2 diabetes mellitus , insulin secretory defect also know important factor development type 2 diabetes mellitus . A previous study show Korean patient , early-phase insulin secretory defect may initial abnormality development type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 56 ] . This study also aim assess efficacy safety glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone versus glibenclamide plus placebo therapy Korean patient type 2 diabetes . In addition , previous study show Korean patient , early-phase insulin secretory defect may initial abnormality development type 2 diabetes mellitus . This study aim show rosiglitazone treatment Korean patient , regardless early phase insulin secretory ability , efficacious safe . Objective ( ) Primary To evaluate effect 12 month oral treatment glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone versus oral glibenclamide plus placebo , body fat distribution ( measure change ratio intra-abdominal adipose tissue abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue area ) patient type 2 diabetes . Secondary - To investigate efficacy glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone , compare glibenclamide plus placebo beta-cell function insulin resistance calculate HOMA-B HOMA-R. - To investigate efficacy glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone , compare glibenclamide plus placebo fasting plasma glucose , insulin , fast serum lipid profile ( total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol total cholesterol HDL cholesterol ratio ) . - To investigate efficacy glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone , compare glibenclamide plus placebo early phase insulin secretion oral glucose tolerance test measure insulinogenic index . - To define clinical safety tolerability glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone assessment physical examination , vital sign , weight , routine laboratory test , adverse experience electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) . Endpoint ( ) Primary Change baseline ratio ( IAAT : SAT ) intra-abdominal adipose tissue area ( IAAT ) abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue area [ SAT ] 12 month treatment oral glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone compare oral glibenclamide plus placebo Secondary Comparisons make glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone glibenclamide plus placebo treatment group Change baseline 6 12 month treatment respect follow : CT Scan Derived CT image lumbar IV level : - abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue area [ SAT ] - intra-abdominal adipose tissue area [ IAAT ] Derived CT image right leg thigh level ( 1cm gluteal fold ) : - total subcutaneous adipose tissue area [ TSAT ] Derived CT image lumbar IV thigh level - ratio abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue area [ SAT ] total subcutaneous adipose tissue area thigh [ TSAT ] - ratio intra-abdominal adipose tissue area [ IAAT ] total subcutaneous adipose tissue area thigh [ TSAT ] Derived Oral Glucose Tolerance Test , glycaemic response OGTT , difference</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects select follow consideration : Diagnosis type 2 diabetes mellitus define American Diabetic Association ( ADA ) criterion . Subject whose diabetes manage diet , exercise , and/or sulfonylurea , and/or metformin , could convert treatment glibenclamide 5mg om . 126mg/dL ≤ fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) ≤ 270mg/dL HbA1c level &gt; 7 % screening . In addition , follow criterion apply prior randomization : 126mg/dL ≤ fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) ≤ 270mg/dL baseline ( 2 month runin treatment glibenclamide 5mg om ) .</criteria>
