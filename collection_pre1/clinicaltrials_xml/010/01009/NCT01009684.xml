	<brief_title>International Active Surveillance Study - Safety Contraceptives : Role Estrogens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During development oral contraceptive ( OCs ) last decade , ethinyl-estradiol ( EE ) reduce hypothesis lower EE dose lead good safety profile specifically lower venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) incidence . However , reduction EE dose lead less favorable bleed control . Though EE utilize within numerous OCs , effort make utilize estradiol ( E2 ) estradiol valerate ( EV ) low impact hepatic system subsequently hemostatic parameter . Bayer Schering Pharma develop new EV base OC dose regimen combine reliable contraception acceptable bleeding profile . The INAS-SCORE study design international , prospective , control , non-interventional cohort study . The study start Europe extend US launch new regimen . New user OC ( starter switcher ) accrue network prescribe physician . Even event high drop-out rate , 3 5-year follow-up 50,000 woman sufficient document 150,000 women-years . Baseline follow-up information collect via self-administered questionnaire . All self-reported clinical outcome interest validate via health care professional . Classification report outcome `` confirm '' `` unconfirmed '' check via blind , independent adjudication . A multifaceted 4-level follow-up procedure prove ensure low loss follow-up rate . The main clinical outcome interest short long-term follow-up cardiovascular event , primarily deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , acute myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident . Data analysis base life-table method . All analysis make allowance confounding , use multivariate technique Cox regression . Study amendment : Follow-up initially expect last 2014 United States Europe . However , European regulatory authority concern low proportion Qlaira user United States request primary analysis base European study arm . However , reduction sample size result reduction statistical power . Therefore agree upon European regulatory authority extend follow-up period Europe till 2016 . This ensure statistical power European study arm high originally plan power complete study population ( European US study population combine ) . The total exposure Europe sufficient exclude twofold risk VTE threefold risk ATE Qlaira compare 'Other COCs ' .</detailed_description>
