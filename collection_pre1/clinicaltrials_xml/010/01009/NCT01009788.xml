	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find combination ABT-888 temozolomide safe effective treating patient metastatic breast cancer . ABT-888 work obstruct DNA enzyme call poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) help repair cancer cell damage chemotherapy . By block PARP enzyme , cancer cell unable repair result die . The drug study temozolomide . Temozolomide design damage DNA order prevent cancer cell reproduce . Because PARP inhibitor , ABT-888 , prevent cancer cell repair DNA , enhance potential chemotherapy therapy like temozolomide induce cell death . The combination ABT-888 temozolomide use clinical trial treatment cancer information research study suggest combination may help inhibit growth breast cancer . ONLY THE EXPANSION COHORT BELOW IS RECRUITING : BRCA CARRIER EXPANSION COHORT : The purpose expansion cohort evaluate activity safety combination BRCA mutation carrier metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Each treatment cycle last 28 day . Participants give supply ABT-88 form capsule take twice daily day 1-7 cycle . Temozolomide also capsule form take daily day 1-5 cycle . - Participants come clinic day 1 cycle follow test procedure perform : physical examination , vital sign blood test . - On day 15 cycle 1 2 day 22 cycle , participant blood work do . - An assessment fo tumor CT scan participant chest , abdomen pelvis do every 2 cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer metastatic ( Stage IV ) locally advanced recurrent breast cancer unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Measurable disease RECIST criterion All immunohistochemical subtypes breast cancer eligible . HER2 positive breast cancer must progress prior standard HER2 therapy contraindication antiHER2 therapy . Must least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease , limit total number prior therapy . 18 year age old Life expectancy least 12 week ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 Normal organ marrow function outline protocol Archived tissue block 25 unstained slide ( primary and/or metastatic tumor ) available correlative exploratory study . Absence available tissue exclude subject participate . CNS metastases allow clinically stable without current evidence symptomatic progression require steroid , whole brain radiation therapy , stereotactic radiosurgery . This may include brain metastasis previously treat clinically stable described . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day registration . Patients must progress current therapy Prior exposure single agent PARP inhibitor allow , prior exposure PARP combination chemotherapy allow . Participants chemotherapy , biologic therapy , small molecule target therapy radiotherapy within 14 day prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Anticancer hormonal therapy must stop 24 hour prior start study treatment . Participants may receive investigational agent . Prior therapy TMZ allow except participant history allergic reaction attribute TMZ , therapy discontinue due intolerance toxicity TMZ . Leptomeningeal disease CNS involvement require steroid ( except patient recently complete brain radiation stable tapering dos steroid ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement , comorbid condition investigator believe may compromise participant 's safe effective participation trial . Concurrent radiation therapy permit study Concurrent anticancer therapy permit study Pregnant breast feed woman History uncontrolled seizure disorder Individuals history malignancy eligible meet follow criterion : ) malignancy treat curative intent deem investigator low risk recurrence , AND b ) metastatic lesion histologically confirm breast cancer , c ) individual follow cancer eligible diagnose treat : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . EXPANSION COHORT : An expansion cohort eligibility requirement follow notable exception : Patients must know deleterious mutation BRCA1/2 Prior PARP inhibitor combination chemotherapy allow Any number prior therapy allow , include first line</criteria>
