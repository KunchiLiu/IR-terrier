	<brief_summary>Treatment : Immunization peptide-mix 17 Clusters Differentiation number 8 ( CD8 ) T cell minimal epitopes 3 Clusters Differentiation number 4 ( CD4 ) T cell epitopes new adjuvant ( CAF01 ) . The vaccine induce cellular immunity human immuno-deficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) . Target group : Untreated healthy individual chronic HIV-1 infection antiretroviral treatment . Purpose : The primary purpose evaluate tolerability safety vaccine . The secondary purpose evaluate clinical effect vaccination treatment measure induction new T cell immunity , lower HIV-1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) viral load plasma , improvement patient CD4 lymphocyte blood count . Design : The experiment design single-blinded , placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial HIV-1 infected individual Denmark . Numbers individual : 20 fully evaluable HIV-1-infected patient enter study ( 15 vaccine treat 5 placebo ( saline ) treat control ) . The hypothesis redirection cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) immunity select relatively immune silent ( subdominant ) conserve CTL target multiple site HIV-1 could provide good immune control virus replication . This could result lower viral load thereby prolonging time antiretroviral therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The HIV-1 vaccine trial design prevent disease healthy already HIV-1 infected individual anti-retroviral treatment induce strong cellular immune response several immune subdominant select target point patient 's HIV-1 virus . The vaccine treatment harmful could potentially lower viral load thus delay time acquire immuno deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) disease need antiviral medicine thereby limit spread HIV-1 population . The patient 's cellular immune response partly control HIV-1 infection eventually lead destruction immune system , opportunistic infection , ultimately death . Normally natural HIV-1 infection provide adequate immunity vaccine must therefore induce potent broad rationally direct immunity . Individuals kind strong immunity lower viral-load live longer . The vaccine study design develop kind potent cellular immunity HIV-1 , virus control good individual spread population limit . This vaccine design match individual 's cellular immune system ( HLA tissue type ) several conserve target point individual 's HIV-1 virus . On basis previous vaccine trial HIV vaccination HIV-infected individual Denmark year research , able develop HIV-1 vaccine . Our vaccine contain 18 peptide ( 15 major histocompatibility complex class 1 ( MHC-I ) restrict CD8-t-cell epitope 3 MHC class-II restrict CD4 T-cell epitope ) mix induce cellular immune response several conserve target point identify HIV-1 . Our vaccine compose 18 peptide lipid base adjuvant Cationic Adjuvant Formulation number 1 ( CAF01 ) compose dimethyl-deoctadecylammonium ( DDA ) trehalose-dibehenate ( TDB ) deem safe technique simple also call 'peptide vaccination ' . This similar technique try several study virus disease around world . We want know degree possible immunize already HIV¬ 1 infected individual prolong healthy period prevent disease initiation antiviral medicine treatment AIDS . In present immunization study , healthy HIV-1 infected individual treatment Denmark invite participate . This vaccine study examine immune response effect vaccine healthy HIV-1-infected individual . The first purpose first determine side-effects vaccine . From several trial animal human recent HIV vaccination trial HIV-1 infected individual Denmark , similar vaccine technique ( peptide autologous Dendritic Cells ( DC ) serious side-effects observe . The second purpose examine vaccine induces expect immune response HIV-1 infected individual enforce supplement already exist 'own ' immune response infect individual . Finally , clinical beneficial effect ( viral load CD4 count ) vaccine evaluate .</detailed_description>
