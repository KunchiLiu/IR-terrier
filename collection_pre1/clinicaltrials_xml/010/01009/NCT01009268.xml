	<brief_title>The Effect Pre- Postoperative Orthogeriatric Service</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study carry close cooperation Orthopaedic Centre Department Geriatric Medicine . The patient randomize Emergency Department accordance procedure already establish recently finish trial . The intervention group transfer soon possible orthogeriatric ward , stabilise preoperatively , transfer back ward postoperatively treatment rehabilitation , control group treat traditional orthopaedic ward . Operative anaesthesiologic procedure two group . The primary endpoint choose order optimize clinical relevance well sensitivity change within wide range functional performance , record four month fracture . Our main hypothesis orthogeriatric service may improve long-time cognitive outcome . Accordingly , use composite endpoint tap cognitive function low well high spectre performance two instrument : - Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ( CDR ) , proxy-based scale severity dementia , able detect difference also patient severe dementia . The scale consist six question , rat 0-3 , add sumscore 0-18 ( `` sum box '' ) . The scale frequently use dementia treatment trial , show valid reliable . CDR score base best available source ( relative , staff nursing home home nursing service ) - The 10 word memory task Consortium Establish Registry Alzheimer 's Disease battery ( CERAD ) . This test show sensitive memory change person good fairly good cognitive functioning . We use immediate recall delay recall part task , i.e . two scale . The primary endpoint assess four month , specially train research assistant blind allocation . The patient re-assessed 12 month .</detailed_description>
