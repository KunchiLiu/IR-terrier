	<brief_summary>Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD/BMD ) genetic disorder develop boy . It cause mutation gene dystrophin , protein important maintain normal muscle structure function . Loss dystrophin cause muscle fragility lead weakness loss walk ability childhood teenage year . A specific type mutation , call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation cause DMD/BMD approximately 10-15 % boys disease . Ataluren ( PTC124 ) orally deliver , investigational drug potential overcome effect nonsense mutation . This study Phase 2a trial enroll boys nonsense mutation DMD/BMD lose independent mobility due disease . This study evaluate safety tolerability ataluren ( PTC124 ) also evaluate efficacy outcome patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ataluren ( PTC124® ) Nonambulatory Patients With Nonsense-Mutation-Mediated Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy ( nmDMD/BMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It plan Phase 2a , open-label , safety efficacy study perform 5 site US 1 site UK . The study enroll ~30 boys nonsense mutation DMD/BMD nonambulatory least one year . Enrollment stratify ensure evaluation ~15 participant receive chronic corticosteroid therapy ~15 participant receive chronic corticosteroid therapy . Subjects take ataluren 3 time per day ( breakfast , lunch , dinner ) 48 week ( ~1 year ) . Study assessment perform clinic visit screen , every 6 week 2 visit every 12 week end study . Additional safety laboratory test require 4 time course study ; may perform investigational site , accredit local laboratory clinic , subject 's home use nursing service .</detailed_description>

Exposure another investigational drug within 2 month prior start study treatment History major surgical procedure within 1 month prior start study treatment expectation major surgical procedure ( eg , scoliosis surgery ) 48week treatment period study Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy ( corticosteroid ) Ongoing participation clinical trial Requirement daytime ventilator assistance Uncontrolled clinical symptom sign congestive heart failure Prior ongoing medical condition ( eg , concomitant illness , psychiatric condition , behavioral disorder , alcoholism , drug abuse ) , medical history , physical finding , ECG finding , laboratory abnormality , investigator 's opinion , could adversely affect safety subject , make unlikely course treatment follow would complete , could impair assessment study result .</criteria>
