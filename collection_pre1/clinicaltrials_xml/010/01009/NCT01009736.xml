	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Tomato-soy juice may slow growth tumor cell . Studying sample blood tissue patient prostate cancer laboratory may help doctor identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor understand effect tomato-soy juice biomarkers . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect tomato-soy juice effect biomarkers patient prostate cancer undergo prostatectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Tomato-Soy Juice Biomarkers Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine incidence severity toxicity associate tomato-soy juice patient undergo prostatectomy . Secondary - Quantify change content distribution soy isoflavones tomato phytochemical ( carotenoid polyphenols ) prostate correlate tissue content pattern blood urinary concentration compound metabolite . - Determine blood hormonal pattern biomarkers oxidative stress favor prostate cancer prevention . - Investigate histopathologic molecular biomarkers associate prostate carcinogenesis may serve surrogate endpoint biomarkers provide information regard ability modulate tomato-soy juice . - Examine several critical histopathologic endpoint , include systemic hormone , cell/matrix interaction tumor microenvironment , molecular process within tumor cell ( tumor grade nuclear morphometry , tumor stage , proliferation index , apoptotic index , angiogenesis/vascularity ) . - Determine consumption tomato-soy juice alters molecular marker human prostate , include neuroendocrine marker IGF-I IGF-BP3 , signal transduction marker PTEN ( phosphatase tensin homologue ) phospho-AKT , angiogenesis regulator VEGF ( vascular epithelial growth factor ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive tomato-soy juice daily 4 week . Patients undergo prostatectomy . Patients complete urologic symptom quality-of-life questionnaire . Blood , urine , tissue sample collect biomarker pharmacokinetic analysis .</detailed_description>
