	<brief_summary>Cervical epidural steroid injection - The hang drop ( HD ) technique commonly use identify cervical epidural space . - The hang drop ( HD ) technique use negative pressure epidural space . - The subject debate whether epidural space exhibit negative pressure . - In previous study , EP might influence body position - No report peer-reviewed literature demonstrate cervical epidural pressure ( CEP ) . The hypothesis study - There difference cervical epidural pressure prone sit position - To evaluate hypothesis , CEPs prone sit group measure compare two group . - Using closed pressure measurement system - Under fluoroscopic guidance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervical epidural steroid injection ( CESIs ) - For conservative management head , neck , upper extremity pain - Important identify epidural space minimize chance dural puncture injection - Dural puncture injection make CESIs prone rare catastrophic complication like permanent spinal cord injury The hang drop ( HD ) technique - Commonly use identify cervical epidural space - Using negative pressure epidural space - The subject debate whether epidural space exhibit negative pressure In previous study use closed pressure measurement system - The epidural pressure ( EP ) commonly positive thoracic level lateral decubitus position . - EP consistently negative sit position . - EP might influence body position . - The patient sit use HD technique . No report peer-reviewed literature demonstrate cervical epidural pressure ( CEP ) . The hypothesis study - There difference cervical epidural pressure prone sit position - To evaluate hypothesis , CEPs prone sit group measure compare two group . - Using closed pressure measurement system - Under fluoroscopic guidance .</detailed_description>
