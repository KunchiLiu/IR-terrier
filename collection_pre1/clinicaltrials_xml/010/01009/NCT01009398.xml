Theoretically thoracic paravertebral block result unilateral thoracic anaesthesia . However , daily clinical practice remain unclear whether catheter place correctly paravertebral region . The investigator ' experience paravertebral catheter suggest may many displacement catheter since pain control reduce compare epidural analgesia .

	<detailed_description>Background The paravertebral block regional anaesthetic technique use analgesia thoracic , cardiac , breast surgery , upper abdominal surgery pain therapy . Thoracic paravertebral blockade perform inject local anaesthetic solution paravertebral space , contain thoracic nerve , branch sympathetic trunk . This space wedge-shaped area sandwich head neck rib . The posterior wall form superior costo-transverse ligament , antero-lateral wall parietal pleura endothoracic fascia medial wall lateral surface vertebral body disc . Also medially , communication epidural space via intervertebral foramen . It show , space communicates inferiorly superiorly across head neck rib . Thus inject local anaesthetic paravertebral space result analgesia correspond unilateral epidural anaesthesia . Unilateral multisegmental anaesthesia single-shot paravertebral injection local anaesthetic well establish . On hand , variety different study volunteer , patient cadaver show conflict result regard vertical spread several adjacent segment paravertebral injection lead recommendation author use multi-injection technique achieve multilevel somatic nerve blockade , specially describe breast surgery use paravertebral block alone . Can explain different contradictory report recommendation ? Available radiologic anatomic study show many different pattern contrast dye spread single shot paravertebral contrast dye injection . One study even report different distribution dye even several paravertebral single shot operator patient . Some radiological study report cloud-like contrast dye accumulation without significant cranio-caudal spread . This could due restrict intercostal spread subpleural spread even injection contrast dye autochthonic muscle back . The spread local anesthetic ( contrast dye substitute ) affect nuance difference needle placement fine membrane like endothoracica fascia . This might major problem insertion catheter . The final location catheter tip hard predict . Catheters might dissect insertion possibly difference medial lateral puncture . The placement catheter paravertebral space lead clear cranio-caudal spread local anaesthetic result multisegmental spread anaesthesia goal catheter paravertebral analgesia seem easy achieve - despite uncontestable clinical benefit paravertebral catheter pain relief . Studies describe exact emplacement catheter , distribution contrast dye correlation distribution clinical effect catheter placement classical land-mark base approach describe Eason Wyatt lack . We therefore aim describe different possible emplacement catheter , result spread contrast dye injection catheter well correspond area somatic sympathetic block . Objective The aim prospective observational clinical trial evaluate exact location paravertebral catheter place thoracoscopic intervention use classic landmark approach inject small amount contrast dye ( 1 ml ) catheter subsequent fluoroscopic documentation catheter tip localisation . Thereafter large amount ( 20 ml ) dilute contrast dye inject spread document fluoroscopically . Methods Once paravertebral catheter place usual end surgery , 1 ml contrast dye inject catheter . After fluoroscopic documentation catheter tip , 10 ml dilute contrast dye inject spread document fluoroscopically two plane . All save picture , show catheter tip position contrast dye spread , evaluate subsequently independent radiologist . After fluoroscopic examination test dose Bupivacaine 0.25 % mixed Adrenaline 5 mcg/ml 3ml injected catheter follow injection 0.3ml/kg local anaesthetic ( Bupivacaine 0.25 % mixed Adrenaline 5 mcg/ml ) . One hour later clinical test skin area somatic sympathetic block provide paravertebral catheter perform data record .</detailed_description>
