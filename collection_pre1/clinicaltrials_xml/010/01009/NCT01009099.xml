	<brief_title>Reducing Dynamic Hyperinflation Through Breathing Retraining</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dynamic hyperinflation limit exercise tolerance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . To limit dynamic hyperinflation exercise thus improve exercise tolerance , successfully developed visual-auditory ventilation-feedback system . The system retrain patient 's breathing pattern exercise . The goal current proposal develop user-friendly ventilation-feedback technique novel auditory feedback system . We reason propose feedback system plus exercise training would superior exercise train alone potential easy application clinical practice . Hypotheses : The primary hypothesis exercise duration patient moderate-to-severe COPD successfully complete 12-week program breathing retrain plus exercise long patient complete 12-week program treadmill exercise train alone . We also hypothesize primary predictor improve exercise duration reduction dynamic hyperinflation lesser extent , improvement peripheral muscle function . Lastly , hypothesize dyspnea reduce patient assign breathe retrain plus exercise compare exercise train alone . Methods : The propose study randomize controlled clinical trial . 119 patient moderate-to-severe COPD randomize breathe retrain plus exercise exercise training alone . Both group receive 12-weeks treadmill exercise training three time weekly . The breathing retrain plus exercise group also receive auditory feedback decrease respiratory rate prolong exhalation . The goal breathe retrain reduce exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation . Follow-up testing complete 6 , 12 , 24 week . Testing include pulmonary function test , symptom-limited constant workrate treadmill test , six-minute walk , dyspnea measurement , test respiratory muscle strength endurance , quadriceps muscle endurance test . Analysis : Measures central tendency use describe study sample . A two-sample t-test ( = 0.05 ) use analyze change baseline 12-weeks breathing retrain plus exercise group exercise train alone group . In data analysis , intention-to-treat principle use . Since several measure take patient , mixed-models analysis use compare change time two group . Multiple regression analysis employ determine predictor improve exercise performance .</detailed_description>
