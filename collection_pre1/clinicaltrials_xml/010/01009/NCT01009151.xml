	<brief_summary>The propose pilot project aim assess feasibility , acceptability impact web-based home tele-monitoring system among congestive heart failure patient University Michigan Health System . The intervention consist daily report via internet health parameter , weight , blood pressure , heart rate heart failure symptom . In addition symptom data reporting , system provide links educational material heart failure reminders self-care measure . It design inexpensive , user-friendly , clinically effective system . Each patient provide unique name password , instruct use self-management website . The propose home monitoring system study hold potential improve life heart failure patient treat University Michigan Health System empower participate actively care reduce risk hospitalization . As heart failure represent common hospital diagnosis relate group ( DRG ) among elderly , study offer significant public health benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study base sample 25 heart failure patient enrol UMHS Heart Failure Program give inform consent participate study . The clinical protocol electronic software develop UMHS-CVC Heart Failure Program collaboration UMHS Telemedicine Resource Center . These protocol contain automated trigger mechanism certain value exceed alert provider patient need take appropriate remedial action . The UMHS Heart Failure Disease Management Program contain registry 3000 patient heart failure problem . Currently , multidisciplinary nursing team maintain routine contact patient telephone call paper record . The program acknowledge adherence quality care measure , first award accreditation JCAHO ambulatory heart failure care . Despite relative success , patient continue high risk re-hospitalization due worsen heart function . The propose tele-monitoring system expect reduce need re-hospitalization improve health outcome virtue automate daily report great patient involvement self-management . Because high promise , area research receiving increase attention , far without definitive result . Previous research provide evidence reduced emergency room visit hospitalization , improve patient compliance care overall cost containment among high-risk patient population . But study rely relatively expensive system involve specialized hardware proprietary software . The cost intervention present limitation broad adoption use technology . The propose project attempt ascertain optimal method clinical cost standpoint in-home telemonitoring large patient population likely grow age population . The primary end-points pilot : ( 1 ) patient willingness use system , perception regard efficacy effectiveness problem encounter use ; ( 2 ) patient adherence heart failure-specific self care practice ; ( 3 ) patient health literacy quality life ; ( 4 ) provider perception efficacy effectiveness system problem encounter use . The finding helpful refine clinical protocol data management algorithm establish solid foundation large-scale randomized clinical trial obtain necessary evidence wide-scale adoption system United States elsewhere .</detailed_description>
