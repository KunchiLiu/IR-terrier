	<detailed_description>Title : Patient Activated Controlled Expansion ( PACE ) Breast Reconstruction Utilizing Controlled CO2 Inflation Design : Prospective , open-label , single-arm , feasibility trial Purpose : To evaluate AirXpanders tissue expander patient undergo breast reconstruction surgery follow mastectomy . Enrollment : This feasibility trial enroll 10 patient . Following enrollment first 5 patient , sponsor determine additional subject recruit evaluate treatment outcome . Clinical Sites : Up 3 site 3 surgeon participate study . The surgeon ( ) necessary qualification sufficient experience ( minimum 12 breast tissue expanders place per year ) participate trial . Duration Patient Participation : Eligible patient enrol approximately 2 month . Patients instructed tissue expansion protocol pre-operatively undergo post-operative clinical follow-up weekly basis frequently deem necessary treating surgeon . Each patient follow removal tissue expander . Study Population : The study population consist 10 patient . Eligible patient female age 18 65 year plan undergo breast reconstruction surgery follow mastectomy . Eligible patient must able provide inform consent understand protocol component .</detailed_description>
