	<brief_summary>1 . Phase I : To estimate Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) RAD001 combination cetuximab cisplatin treatment metastatic squamous cell cancer head neck ( SCCHN ) . 2 . Phase II : To estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) RAD001 MTD combination weekly cetuximab cisplatin day 1 8 28 day cycle patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN , Secondary Objectives 1 . To estimate complete partial response rate RAD001 MTD combination weekly cetuximab cisplatin day 1 8 28 day cycle patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN , 2 . To explore clinical activity regimen correlate marker EGF-R/mTOR pathway tumor tissue serial sampling tumor . 3 . To explore role FDG PET image early indicator response combination .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma head neck , recurrent metastatic disease . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . 3 . Patients must prior monoclonal antibody small molecule tyrosinekinase inhibitor treatment recurrent metastatic SCCHN . In addition , prior chemotherapy treatment recurrent metastatic SCCHN allow . 4 . If patient previous radiation marker lesion ( ) , must evidence progression since radiation . Patients must great equal 12 week completion prior curative intent therapy include surgery , radiation , systemic anticancer therapy . If palliative radiation therapy give recurrent metastatic disease , patient must great equal four week treatment . 5 . No concurrent malignancy except curatively treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix . Patients prior history malignancy must disease free great equal two year . 6 . Age &gt; 18 year . 7 . Life expectancy great 4.5 month . 8 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . 9 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal within normal institutional limit . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3.0 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal 3.1.8 10 . As investigational agent RAD001 require enteral administration , patient must able receive adequate enteral nutrition mouth Gtube device . 11 . The effect RAD001 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 12 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition RAD001 agent use study . 5 . Patients receive medication substance inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A ineligible . Lists include medication substance know potential interact CYP3A isoenzymes provide appendix . 6 . Patients receive chronic treatment systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent ineligible . 7 . Patients know hypersensitivity RAD001 ( everolimus ) rapamycin ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients . 8 . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g . ulcerative disease ; uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea ; malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) . 9 . Patients active bleeding diathesis patient oral antivitamin K agent ( exclude low dose warfarin ) . 10 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , severely impaired lung function psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Severely impaired lung function define spirometry DLCO 50 % normal predict value /or O2 saturation 88 % less room air . 11 . Pregnant woman exclude study RAD001 mTOR inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother RAD001 , breastfeed discontinue . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 12 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction RAD001 . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
