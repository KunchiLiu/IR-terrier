Systolic BP le 100 mmHg and/or diastolic le 60 mmHg . Subjects QTcB and/or QTcF great 450ms great 480ms bundle branch block ECG abnormality , opinion investigator clinically significant may increase safety risk . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Pregnant female determine positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen prior dosing . Treatment cholinesterase inhibitor ( include Tacrine ) , memantine selegiline within last 3 month prior screen . No patient AD already medication time screen recruit , would unethical withdraw medication study participation . Only AD subject yet medication , withdrawn medication reason previously , may enrol study . Use follow medication within last 30 day 5 halflives medication screen ( prohibit Section 9.2 ) : Any treatment approved country treatment cognitive symptom AD .
