	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether single vaccination ( injection ) investigational HIV vaccine safe effective patient HIV positive yet begin anti-retroviral therapy . As exploratory study , four different dose formulation HIV vaccine investigate . This study evaluate whether HIV vaccine able reduce HIV viral load ( number HIV virus particle blood ) increase slow decline CD4 T cell count .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist screen period 3 21 day vaccination Day 0 double-blind treatment period 28 day follow period 5 month . Prior conduct study-related procedure , subject provide write informed consent . During screening , eligibility assess , medical history take , complete physical examination perform vital sign measure . Blood sample take assessment HCV HBV status . Further sample take CD4 HIV load , haematology , biochemistry , urinalysis 12-lead electrocardiographic ( ECG ) assessment carry . A self-assessment diary card use subject Day 0 Day 28 record AEs . On Days 7 , 14 , 21 28 AE interview conduct , concomitant medication vital sign record physical examination perform . Samples collect haematology , clinical chemistry urinalysis . In addition , sample collect CD4 T cell count HIV viral load day 14 28 vaccination . A sample collected immunogenicity Day 28 . All patient attend follow-up visit Weeks 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 physical examination examination injection site perform vital sign measure . Samples collect haematology , biochemistry , urinalysis CD4 T-cell count HIV viral load . Blood sample immunogenicity test collect Weeks 12 24 . Stage I : Sequential , non-randomised , single blind , parallel group . Five male HIV-1 positive volunteer vaccinate sequential , non-randomised single blind fashion . They receive one five possible active study treatment ( WFI , adjuvant , low dose + WFI , low dose + adjuvant , high dose + WFI high dose + adjuvant ) . Each five patient observe in-patients 24 hour vaccination vaccination perform sequential manner least 48 hour observation patient vaccination next patient commence . Following completion '28 day treatment follow ' five Stage I subject Safety Committee review safety tolerability data subject make recommendation continue discontinue recruitment change may require conduct study . Subject positive decision Safety Committee remain subject recruit Stage II study . Stage II : randomise , double-blind group 50 male HIV-1 positive volunteer randomise one five possible treatment group . Following completion Day 1 Visit first five subject Stage II Safety Committee review blind safety tolerability data subject . Subject acceptable safety tolerability , centre allow continue recruitment rest plan cohort . After 25 Stage II subject complete Day 1 Visit Safety Committee review blind data generate make recommendation continue discontinue recruitment change may require conduct study .</detailed_description>
