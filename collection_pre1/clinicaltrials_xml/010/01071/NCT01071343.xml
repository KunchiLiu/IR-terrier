	<brief_summary>A grow number critically ill patient survive intensive care discharge hospital . However , critical illness prolong bedrest associate muscle waste subsequent implication recovery normal physical function . Thus , one year discharge , survivor septic shock report prolonged severe impairment physical function . Early intervention employ ICU counteract loss muscle mass may potentially improve physical outcome reduce overall burden critical illness . As potential supplement physical therapy , transcutaneous electric muscle stimulation ( TEMS ) non-invasive method direct maintain skeletal muscle function artificially induced contraction independent patient effort . TEMS previously proven effective preventing loss muscle mass force number non-ICU patient group , assess sparsely ICU population immobilisation systemic inflammation present . Therefore , aim present study assess effect early TEMS muscle volume patient admit intensive care unit septic shock . The investigator hypothesize intervention would preserve muscle volume septic shock .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To ensures baseline comparability , eliminate many inter-individual confound factor often present ICU patient enhance statistical strength design study include well-defined group patient septic shock single-legged exercise design , use contralateral leg ( pair ) control use two-channel stimulation approach 3-D evaluation muscle volume change base CT scan . After randomization quadriceps muscle TEMS apply intervention side 7 consecutive day , 60 minute per day . All patient undergoes CT scan thighs immediately 7-day treatment period . The quadriceps muscle manually delineate transverse CT slice , muscle volume calculate 3-D reconstruction .</detailed_description>
