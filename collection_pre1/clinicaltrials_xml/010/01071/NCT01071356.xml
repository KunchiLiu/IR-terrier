	<brief_summary>A Stage 2 randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) propose test efficacy promise 9-session model motivational interviewing ( MI ) methamphetamine ( MA ) dependence . Stage 1 pilot test indicate intervention could easily learn implement fidelity . The sample 30 MA dependent individual 9 week show large reduction MA use , good retention consistent attendance . The tailored treatment approach draw upon previous conceptual paper MI well experience variety MI protocol , include two Clinical Trials Network ( CTN ) study MI . An innovative feature `` Higher Dose Motivational Enhancement Therapy '' manual comprehensively address issue client achieve sustained sobriety well still use substance . Thus , design facilitate treatment entry engagement well maintenance gain make treatment . We posit intensive MI model necessary address MA dependent individual frequently present serious problem individual substance dependency prone lose gain make treatment . MA dependent client ( N=220 ) recruit New Leaf outpatient treatment Lafayette , California . This site long history conduct research , include participation multi-site study assess treatment outcome MA dependence . Study participant randomly assign 1 ) single session Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) plus 8 hour health/nutrition education , 2 ) intensive 9-session MI intervention . In addition study intervention , group receive standard outpatient treatment service New Leaf . Study participant assess weekly first 9 week treatment MA use . More extensive assessment conduct treatment entry 2- , 4-and 6-month follow-up . Two therapist `` cross '' treat client condition . Primary outcome measure Timeline Follow Back ( TLFB ) MA use , MA urinalysis result , retention treatment . Secondary outcome include Addiction Severity Index scale TLFB alcohol drug . Exploratory analyse examine HIV risk behavior , motivation , service utilization . A mediation model build upon MI research Moyers et al . ( 2005 ) construct `` supportive confrontation '' ( Polcin , et al. , 2006 ) test whether feedback enhance warning potential harm MA use facilitate therapeutic alliance , whether turn facilitates well outcome . The significance study highlight recent meta-analysis find high dos MI associate good outcome ( Burke et al. , 2003 ) . Conversely , several recent study standard single session MI drug dependent client question effectiveness , study find improvement retention substance use . Clients MA dependence good candidate intensive dose MI severe medical psychosocial problem . Thus , time test promising , 9-session MI manual useful extension standard MI client MA dependence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal respond PA-07-111 , `` Behavioral &amp; Integrative Treatment Development Program '' issue National Institute Drug Abuse . Based promising pilot data , propose test efficacy 9-session Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) manual treat methamphetamine ( MA ) dependence ( Galloway , Polcin , Kielstein , Brown &amp; Mendelson , 2007 ; Polcin , Galloway , Palmer &amp; Mains , 2004 ; Polcin , Brown &amp; Galloway , 2005 ) . ( See Appendix A copy Intensive Standard Manuals Appendix B paper describe rationale structure ) . The study build upon progression work initial conceptualization intensive model MI ( Polcin , et al. , 2004 ) , development `` Higher Dose Motivational Enhancement Therapy Manual '' ( Polcin , et al. , 2005 ) , presentation promising stage 1 pilot data ( Galloway , et al , 2007 ) . The propose study represent logical next step research program . In meta-analysis MI study , Burke , Arkowitz &amp; Menchola ( 2003 ) find high dos MI associate well outcome . Based finding , call new study compare effectiveness standard low dose intensive MI . This proposal respond call . To date , direct comparison high low intensity MI publish , aware intensive manual one present . Our proposal address aims NIDA Program Announcement ( PA-07-111 ) well announcement call innovation refinement behavioral therapy understudied population . Clients MA dependence specifically identify understudied population need behavioral therapy trial . MA use rampant Western U.S. grow part country well oversee ( Anglin et al. , 2007 ; Rawson &amp; Condon , 2007 ) . Studies show MA dependent individual frequently present serious medical psychiatric condition complicate treatment effort ( Rawson , et al. , 2000 , 2004 ) . Based excellent retention client pilot test ( see Pilot Study outcomes Preliminary Studies section ) , hypothesize intensive MI particularly useful improve high treatment dropout rate low engagement among MA dependent client . Behavioral intervention particularly need currently evidence base pharmacological protocol treat MA dependence ( Vocci &amp; Appel , 2007 ) . In proposal , `` standard '' MI condition single session manual base MI ( Martino et al. , 2006 ) plus eight hour health/nutrition education use structure educational format ( Harris , 2003 , 2006 ) . A copy MI intervention find Appendix A draft version nutrition/health intervention find Appendix D. Our `` intensive '' MI condition refers 9-session manual intervention . As detailed Preliminary Studies Section , development manual , method stage 1 pilot testing , procedures train therapist follow recommendation make Rounsaville , Carroll , Onken ( 2001 ) Carroll et al . ( 2006 ) . As stage 2 behavioral trial , study include assessment dose-response relationship high likelihood illuminate potential mechanism action within single data collection site . Positive finding lead stage 3 application examine effectiveness intervention community-based setting use multi-site design would allow broad generalization . MA dependent participant recruit New Leaf outpatient treatment program Lafayette , California . This data collection site history successfully recruit MA dependent client research protocol ( e.g. , Galloway , et . al. , 2000 ; Rawson et . al. , 2004 ) . In addition receive one MI intervention , participant receive standard outpatient treatment offer New Leaf . The specific aim hypothesis detail . In addition compare treatment condition outcome measure , overlay naturalistic design build upon MI research examine mediator outcome conduct Moyers , Miller &amp; Hendickson ( 2005 ) . We propose assess impact modify definition feedback therapeutic alliance turn MA use . Our definition feedback include provide objective information personalize feedback client , add construct supportive confrontation ( Polcin , 2006a ; Polcin , Galloway &amp; Greenfield , 2006 ; Polcin , Galloway , Bostrom &amp; Greenfield , 2007 ; Polcin &amp; Greenfield , 2006 ) . This concept entail provide warning client potential harm might result action take address problem area . Supportive confrontation integral part feedback MI intervention provide data Preliminary Studies ( see Measuring Confrontation Recovery subheading ) indicate type confrontation experience supportive , accurate helpful ( e.g . Polcin et al. , 2006 ) . We also suggest finding consistent work Moyers , et al . ( 2005 ) , find confrontational intervention associate enhance therapeutic alliance deliver therapist high degree skill . To avoid destructive interaction Miller , Benefield Tonigan ( 1993 ) find counterproductive ( e.g. , argumentation ) therapists `` roll resistance '' encounter client react defensively reject confrontational statement . Aim 1 . To compare MA use retention treatment among client receive intensive standard MI . Hypothesis 1.1 : The intensive MI condition demonstrate long retention treatment , few day MA use , few positive urine test standard MI condition first 9 week treatment . Hypothesis 1.2 : The intensive MI condition demonstrate few day MA use fewer positive urine test standard MI condition 2- , 4- , 6-month follow-up . Aim 2 . To compare Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ) scale among client receive intensive standard MI . Hypothesis 2.1 : ASI score client intensive condition significantly low score standard condition 2- , 4- , 6-month follow-up . Aim 3 . To assess whether feedback enhance supportive confrontation directly impact outcome impact outcome indirectly strong therapeutic alliance . Hypothesis 3.1 : Higher Frequency/Extensiveness Skill Level Feedback enhance supportive confrontation decrease MA use . Hypothesis 3.2 : Higher Frequency/Extensiveness Skill Level Feedback enhance supportive confrontation enhance therapeutic alliance , turn impact MA use . Exploratory Analyses 1 . We make repeated measure comparison two treatment condition use alcohol drug addition MA . These include self-report measure well urine screen breathalyzer result . 2 . We compare intensive standard MI service utilization , assess use additional formal treatment informal recovery service self-help group . 3 . We compare longitudinal measure motivation two condition ass whether high motivation associate well outcome . 4 ) We compare HIV risk behavior among client receive intensive standard MI .</detailed_description>
