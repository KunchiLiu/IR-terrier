	<brief_summary>Main Research Questions : 1 . Is large trial patient undergoing heart surgery compare simple procedure temporarily stop blood flow leg blood pressure cuff ( call remote ischemic preconditioning ) sham procedure possible ? 2 . Does remote ischemic preconditioning procedure heart surgery help protect heart kidneys ? What Being Studied : A simple procedure know remote ischemic preconditioning . The procedure perform inflate pressurize cuff thigh temporarily stop blood flow arm leg . This procedure cause body stress response , cellular level , may protect major organ like heart kidney damage cause much large stress cardiac surgery . Reducing damage may improve patient 's recovery surgery help live long . Why study important ? : This research important 1 every 20 patient undergo heart surgery die even leave hospital . Preventing heart kidney damage time surgery remote ischemic preconditioning may reduce patient death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Annually , 2 million patient worldwide undergo heart surgery . Although procedure prolong life , 1 20 patient survive hospital stay . Acute heart kidney injury important cause death heart surgery . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) promise simple therapy may simultaneously reduce heart kidney damage . RIPC involve inflation tourniquet blood pressure cuff limb briefly stop blood flow limb . This period blood flow activate body 's protective system release protective chemical blood also protect heart kidney . RIPC particularly attractive potential treatment may protect several organ , know adverse effect cost almost nothing . RIPC could therefore easily use globally improve outcome patient undergo heart surgery . Although RIPC appear promising several small study use different RIPC regimens study large enough definitively evaluate whether RIPC improve patient important outcome ( e.g . survival , kidney failure , major heart attack , stroke ) . Before perform large trial determine whether RIPC effective , must demonstrate trial feasible . We determine recruitment rate adequacy follow-up international group centre ensure adequately powered trial RIPC compare sham procedure possible . Further , ensure RIPC regimen consistent trial term effect cardiac kidney injury . This pilot trial enroll 250 patient randomize half RIPC half sham procedure . We call trial Remote IscheMia Preconditioning cArdiaC surgery Trial ( Remote IMPACT ) .</detailed_description>
