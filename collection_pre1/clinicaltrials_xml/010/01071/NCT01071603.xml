	<brief_summary>Background : - In spite well-researched treatment therapy , 5 10 percent tuberculosis ( TB ) patient initially successful TB treatment relapse , usually within year completion therapy . This percentage even great patient infect multi-drug resistant extensively drug resistant type TB . Because People Republic China second high number TB case world , researcher interest study TB patient China evaluate response treatment long-term basis . Objectives : - To improve TB diagnosis test determine number proportion patient admit suspected TB actually TB ( definite probable ) . - To assess prevalence non-tuberculosis bacteria among patient presume TB . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age admit Henan Provincial Chest Hospital suspect tuberculosis . Design : - Participants divide three group , base diagnosis admission . Another group individual TB enrol control comparison purpose study . - The study use compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest initial enrollment , 2 month , 6 month evaluate disease response treatment . Incidents TB chest area ( extrapulmonary TB ) also study . - The study also monitor treatment therapy use disease , change patient immune system , change biological sample take course treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite optimal antimicrobial treatment directly observe short-course therapy ( DOTS ) , 5-10 percent drug-compliant patient cure tuberculosis ( TB MTB ) relapse , usually within year completion therapy . This percentage even great patient previously treat TB often infect multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) extensively drug resistant ( XDR ) organism . The People Republic China second high number case TB world , rate 101 cases/100,000 person-years estimate 2004 . Based data 4th national TB epidemiological survey 2000 , estimate 1.96 million instance pulmonary TB . With establish MDR TB prevalence 10.7 percent , estimate 209,720 case pulmonary , bacteriology confirm MDR TB China 2000 . About half prevalent case TB disease 2000 extrapulmonary . This prospective longitudinal natural history study monitor 150 subject suspect TB Henan Provincial Chest Hospital initial response antituberculous chemotherapy . The subject divide 3 group TB-infected individual : Cohort A ) acid-fast bacillus ( AFB ) smear positive pulmonary disease ; Cohort B ) smear negative pulmonary disease ; Cohort C ) extra-pulmonary disease ( EPTB ) order reflect spectrum TB manifestation observe Henan Provincial Chest Hospital . We also enrol 45 non-TB suspect control ( Cohort D ) . The control group serve comparison group exploratory immunologic diagnostic assay may , future , serve way diagnose TB and/or evaluate response therapy . In exploratory study , look change total volume disease detect computerized tomography scan chest baseline , 2 month , 6 month . We also look scan region extrapulmonary TB . In addition , monitor chemotherapeutic regimen , change host immune response , overall change clinical parameter , initial acquire drug-resistance infecting isolates , change bacterial host marker subject sample chemotherapy . In case , look association parameter rate disease resolution correlate specific structural feature determine computerized tomography scan site TB disease ( exception TB meningitis cutaneous TB , specific lesion follow radiographically ) . These study allow u evaluate use entry criterion future clinical trial eventual TB diagnosis confirmation use entry categorization . We also able examine impact initial regimen selection , subsequent modification , mycobacterial strain characteristic , extent disease , type lesion host immunologic response overall outcome chemotherapy , well potentially identify surrogate marker improve monitoring response chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
