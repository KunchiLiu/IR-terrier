	<brief_summary>The association sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome ( SAHS ) infection low airway study . The aspiration secretion upper airway colonization microorganism consider main event case community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) , specially nosocomial pneumonia . The silent aspiration lower airway common phenomenon normal subject sleep study report patient SAHS present increase risk pharyngeal aspiration . In fact , presence nasal bronchial inflammation patient SAHS recognize event . The patient SAHS could risk increase develop pneumonia due predisposition pharyngeal microaspiration lower airway sleep mechanical factor associate . The prevalence SAHS patient CAP could increase regard data publish Spanish population . The presence apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) could risk factor CAP present unfavorable clinical evolution comparison patient CAP normal AHI . The aim study establish relation SAHS pneumonia risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective comparative case control study compare prevalence sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome patient community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) . Patients hospitalized CAP ( Group A ) study respiratory polygraphy sleep second respiratory polygraphy conduct home curation pneumonia ( one month ) . During admission , etiological study include blood culture , serology , urinary antigen legionella S , pneumoniae , sputum culture invasive technique bronchoscopy appropriate obtain . Questionnaires related sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome obtain consist Epworth test , symptom questionnaire FOSQ test . Group B patient infection urinary , bone , pelvic infection exclude upper low respiratory infection . Respiratory polygraphy perform group group A obtaining questionnaire . We compare variable respiratory polygraphy , questionnaires score , percentage patient AHI &gt; 12 group compare variable obtain respiratory polygraphy perform hospital home group A evaluate condition alter AHI previous CAP episode . We obtain prevalence sleep apnea-hypopnea patient group compare factor risk ( COPD , diabetes mellitus , bronchial asthma , etc ) A B . Finally multivariable analysis conduct evaluate contribution AHI CAP , recognize factor risk . Both group pair age , sex body mass index</detailed_description>
