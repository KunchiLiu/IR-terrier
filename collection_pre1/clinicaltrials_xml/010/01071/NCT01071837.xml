	<detailed_description>In phase II trial , patient recurrence / progression glioblastoma ( first second progression ) either eligible tumour resection macroscopic residual tumour resection recurrence include ( tumor size must 1-4 cm T1-weighted MRI ) . They must candidate re-irradiation randomize 1:2 ratio re-irradiation alone re-irradiation + 400mg APG101 weekly intravenous infusion . Radiotherapy ( RT ) consider standard care study procedure . As prior therapy , first radiotherapy ( maximal dose 60 Gy ; least 8 month since end preirradiation ) , prior surgery ( least histology ) least one Temozolomide-containing chemotherapy mandatory ; patient prior treatment bevacizumab , iodine seed and/or brachytherapy eligible . The patient ' steroid dose must stable decrease upon inclusion . The number patient include study 83 ( depend statistical 2-step SIMON design ) . Primary objective : 6 month rate progression free survival ( PFS6 ) . Subjects participate study long clinical benefit consider treat physician . MRI tumour image carry every 6 week .</detailed_description>
