	<brief_summary>Premature birth public health problem incidence recently increase developed country . In Canada , represent 6.4 % births 1981 7.6 % 2000 . In last decade , survival rate premature infant increase considerably , neurological vulnerability change . Premature birth cause approximately 28 % neonatal mortality world major cause perinatal mortality morbidity develop country . Approximately 75-80 % preterm birth spontaneous preterm birth . This type premature birth include preterm labor premature rupture membrane term . The contractile activity represent one fundamental property uterus pregnancy childbirth . The abnormality associate uterine contraction cause pathological condition important consequence mother fetus . Metabolomics involve new technology investigate small molecule characterize biochemical pathway interest . The change concentration level molecules various biological sample urine blood presence disease patient particularly useful identify new biomarkers . The hypothesis study gestational metabolomes detect maternal fluid differ accord pathological situation lead initiation spontaneous labor . The whole research program two complementary objective order expect decrease prematurity : ) well understanding physiological mechanism lead prematurity b ) good identification patient high risk well management woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metabolomics involve new technology use method separation detection complex investigate set small molecule characterize biochemical pathway interest . The change concentration level molecules various biological sample urine blood presence disease patient detect metabolic fingerprint particularly useful identify new biomarkers . These thereafter quantify validate metabolic profiling . To knowledge , study metabolomics pregnancy . Methods : The studied population pregnant woman 20-30 week gestation without obstetrical complication . Vaginal secretion , blood urine sample take : - After inclusion project - At hospital admission delivery - During labor Blood urine sample also take : - 48 hour delivery - 6-8 week delivery</detailed_description>
