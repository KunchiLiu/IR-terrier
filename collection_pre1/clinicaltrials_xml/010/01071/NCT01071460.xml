	<brief_summary>Purpose registry determine efficacy safety self-expanding , extra flexible FlexStent patient superficial femor/popliteal artery disease . The stent develop cope extreme requirement femoral artery/knee artery approve usage human ( EC-certified ) . It design treat narrow femoral- knee artery . 100 patient 5 German hospital shall enrol . After stent implantation follow-up visit 6 12 month take place .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Safety FlexStent Self-Expanding Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) represent major challenge physician treat Superficial Femoral ( SFA ) Popliteal artery . These artery represent harsh environment endovascular device . This disease characterize long occlusion relatively low flow vessel expose enormous mechanical stress . During flex knee , SFA/Popliteal arteries bend , rotate , elongate compress dramatically . An ideal stent design use SFA/Popliteal artery would offer great range movement adequately support artery . The FlexStent® stent provide great range motion highly flexible femoral artery adequately support vessel . The intend use FlexStent® stent treatment symptomatic femoropopliteal disease , primarily atherosclerotic de novo native superficial femoral artery lesion . The intent clinical registry demonstrate efficacy safety FlexStent® stent patient superficial femoral/ popliteal artery disease . Hypothesis : FlexStent® safe efficacious treat SFA/popliteal artery disease . Primary object : evaluation efficacy FlexStent® measure in-stent restenosis use DUS follow treatment , 6 12 MFU visit .</detailed_description>
