	<brief_summary>This study evaluate responsiveness variety available dyskinesia rating scale treatment amantadine placebo Parkinson 's disease patient dyskinesia . The study parallel , double-blind , randomized trial 68 patient treated amantadine placebo 8 week . Pre-treatment evaluation perform compare end study evaluation best treatment dose ( 200 300 mg amantadine match placebo ) daily . Safety evaluation conduct . The responsiveness different scale evaluate statistically mixed model change outcome measure time include fix effect treatment group assignment . The model additionally account random effect intercept ( scale score baseline ) include random variation ( person-specific ) specific variation associate rate change outcome . The investigator may include adjustment possible confound covariates , include baseline demographic center . The goal program provide researcher best scale ( ) distinguish dyskinesia change Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) associate amantadine comparison placebo establish magnitude effect achievable amantadine comparator `` gold standard '' must meet surpassed future anti-dyskinetic agent . Additionally , use paper pencil questionnaire , study investigate impact patient optimism patient rater expectation positive effect dyskinesia rating outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective/Rationale : Dyskinesias , involuntary jerking movement , troublesome problem many Parkinson 's disease patient . Chemical study lead development several new treatment strategy . However , dyskinesia cause various degree difficulty patient often perceive patient caregiver differently doctor , rating dyskinesia remain scientific challenge . This program examine wide gamut available rating scale determine one ( ) detect change dyskinesia treatment . Establishing excellent measurement tool dyskinesias allow future treatment evaluate uniform maximally effective manner . Project Description : An team expert test several dyskinesia scale group Parkinson 's disease patient dyskinesia . Patients treat either amantadine placebo ( inactive product ) . The study `` blind '' raters patient know give patient receive amantadine placebo . Amantadine select trial , drug receive designation Efficacious dyskinesia Movement Disorder Society . This conclusion base however , small study large clinical trial drug conduct dyskinetic patient . The scale assess dyskinesia several week treatment . Relevance Diagnosis/Treatment Parkinson 's Disease : This study establish `` gold standard '' rating dyskinesia future trial treatment Parkinson 's disease patient . It allow physician know level change occur standard available treatment ( amantadine ) compare level change occur new treatment . Patients benefit new international standard , compare likelihood magnitude anticipated improvement different dyskinesia treatment , whether medical surgical . Anticipated Outcome : The anticipated outcome study : - The impact amantadine treatment dyskinesia clearly define . - The effect participation clinical program , even amantadine give ( `` placebo improvement '' ) delineate . - A hierarchy numerous scale determine base absolute relative capability detect change treatment . - The best scale ( ) evaluate dyskinesia clinical practice research effort identify .</detailed_description>
