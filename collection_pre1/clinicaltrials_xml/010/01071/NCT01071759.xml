	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency consider one main nutritional deficiency disorder despite apparent availability high-quality diet even developed country , Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) common form anemia world . IDA pregnancy associate adverse health consequence mother develop fetus . Helicobacter pylorus ( Hp ) may common bacterial infection worldwide , infect almost half people develop country 80 % people develop country . The available data prevalence Hp infection Taiwan population 54.4 % . We know infection Hp strongly associate peptic ulcer gastric cancer , recent evidence suggest Hp associate iron deficiency anemia , although mechanism remain unclear . Till , previous study specifically address potential role Hp infection anemia iron deficiency pregnancy . Our previous Research show , Hp infection ( + ) Hp infection ( - ) gravida , association Hp infection iron deficiency strong , although statistically significant . This might due need case evidence prove relationship maternal Hp infection serum iron , ferritin hemoglobin level , consider interaction particular custom diet preference Taiwanese gravida . This longitudinal study recruit 140 woman antenatal care clinic E-Da Hospital examine association Hp infection maternal IDA . The standardized interview mother ( anthropometric data , socioeconomic status , medical history , obstetric history , alcohol consumption pregnancy , history duration iron supplementation pregnancy ) conduct , Hp infection status determine urea breath test IgG enzyme immunoassay , measurement hemoglobin , iron , ferritin level obtain 5 time various antepartum postpartum point time pregnancy ( routine prenatal visit 1st , 2nd , 3rd trimester , puerperium 2 week delivery ) . We hope could investigate possible role Hp infection iron deficiency iron-deficiency anemia pregnancy Taiwan , early detection treatment anemia may reduce risk blood transfusion perinatal maternal mortality .</brief_summary>
