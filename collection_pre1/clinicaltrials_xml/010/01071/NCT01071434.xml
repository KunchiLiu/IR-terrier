	<detailed_description>Accurate dose delivery remain one weakest aspects radiotherapy , especially case thoracic abdominal tumor , significant patient motion occur dose delivery ( intrafraction motion ) . Such motion result geometric dosimetric uncertainty compromise treatment quality . Effective management intrafraction motion therefore key realize full potential modern image-guided radiation therapy ( IGRT ) . While external marker find well-correlated internal anatomy within image session , guarantee correlation continue exist constant throughout course therapy . In general , implanted , radio-opaque seed find reliable external marker . However , implantation fiducials , whether radio-opaque electromagnetic , necessarily invasive carry risk associate complication - issue become especially important cancer patient weaken immune system . Currently , MR image modality non-invasive provide high quality volumetric information whole body . The `` ideal '' intrafraction motion management require complete spatio-temporal knowledge irradiate anatomy . However , date , clinical method directly visualize tumor volume dose delivery . Most technique rely external internal surrogate marker often provide ( usually non-volumetric ) information limit accuracy reliability . In addition , internal marker impose significant `` cost '' patient term interventional complication increase image dose . In work , investigate feasibility use in-room , fast cine MR image non-invasive mean provide real-time , soft-tissue-based , volumetric image guidance continuous monitoring target surround anatomy . To date , systematic investigation imaging requirement integrate MRI+linac specific task real-time radiotherapy guidance .</detailed_description>
