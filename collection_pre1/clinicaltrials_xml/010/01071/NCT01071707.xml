	<brief_summary>Study purpose : The disease course idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) variable . During course disease patient get well , stay , others get bad . Currently doctor way predict individual patient disease course . The purpose study determine 'biomarkers ' protein gene isolate time diagnosis use predict disease course . These 'biomarkers ' obtain sample blood , procedure call bronchoscopy , patient extra tissue obtain surgical lung biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study follow : Specific Aim 1 : Assemble network clinical center procure biologic sample subject recently diagnose IPF follow subject least 48 week . Specific Aim 2 : Correlate integrate biologically plausible biomarkers disease activity obtain multiple compartment ( SLB , BAL , TBB , blood ) subject longitudinal measure disease progression ( change force vital capacity , change diffusion capacity carbon monoxide , acute exacerbation pulmonary fibrosis , death ) . General Study Design This study take place two phase . During first phase study identify collect baseline specimens subject either suspect recently diagnose ( within 48 month ) IPF . During second phase study subject IPF follow 48 80 week . Subjects follow end study ( 2 year grant award ) meet part composite endpoint ( death , acute exacerbation IPF , relative decline FVC least 10 % DLCO 15 % ) . This prospective cohort study . There treatment prescribe studied part prospective cohort study . Subjects able utilize treatment prescribe physician , include participation clinical trial long able comply follow schedule study .</detailed_description>
