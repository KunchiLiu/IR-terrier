	<brief_title>Buprenorphine Late-Life Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recruit 20 participant pilot study . Subjects recruit either : 1 ) An ongoing study Late-Life Depression ( MH083660 ; PI : Reynolds ) meet research response criterion ; 2 ) community-dwelling individual , least 50 year old , try least two FDA-approved antidepressant medication therapeutic dos least 6 week , currently episode major depression . Overview intervention : To guide future placebo-controlled work , preliminary stage research collect data buprenorphine ( BUP ) 1 ) augmentation pharmacotherapy , 2 ) monotherapy . Subjects recruit community buprenorphine prescribe augmentation currently prescribe antidepressant medication . BUP 0.2 mg use first week . The first dose administer clinic supervision PI . Because peak plasma level occur 60 minute ingestion , subject re-assessed 1 hour safety . Participants see weekly eight week assess progress monitor intervention-emergent side effect . Dosing increase guide antidepressant response ( e.g. , continue MADRS score &gt; 10 trigger increase dose BUP ) protocolized use Frequency , Intensity , Burden Side Effect Rating ( FIBSER ) Scale score . For example , score 5 7 FIBSER trigger additional assessment side effect require justification increase dose , score &gt; 7 signal increase dose , although specific side effect review detail final determination , include review UKU Side Effects Rating Scale . We increase dose 0.2 mg/week 1.6 mg/day base MADRS FIBSER score . Every time dose increase , first ingestion high dose monitor clinic described . Subjects participate project Late-Life Depression Clinic 7th Floor Bellefield Tower . Subjects complete paper pencil clinician-administered psychiatric assessment receive first dose buprenorphine subsequent visit . After first ingestion subsequent first ingestion higher dos BUP , subject remain clinic 60 minute ingestion re-assessed emergence side effect vital sign re-checked . The duration first visit approximately 2.5 hour . If subsequent visit require observed ingestion buprenorphine , last 1.75 hour . If subsequent visit require observed ingestion buprenorphine , visit last 30-45 minute . Prior first ingestion , first ingestion subsequent high dos , study end , subject complete 15 minute battery computerized neuropsychological test assess reaction time attention . These test repeat 60 minute ingestion . Prior first ingestion discontinuation buprenorphine , memory assess Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( HVLT ) . The HVLT take 10 minute complete . The discontinuation phase occur week 9-12 . To minimize risk withdrawal symptom , discontinue buprenorphine slowly reduce dose 0.4 mg/day 7 day , 0.2 mg/day every day 7 day , stop buprenorphine . We see subject weekly four week . The final visit occur week 16 . This telephone check mood function . This call take 15-20 minute .</detailed_description>
