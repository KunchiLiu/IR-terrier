	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ) give together vismodegib treat patient breast cancer metastatic remove surgery . RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , vismodegib , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving RO4929097 vismodegib together may slow growth tumor cell may active treatment advance breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability continuous daily administration 150 mg/day GDC0449 ( vismodegib ) combination escalate dos RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ) administer repeat schedule day 1-3 , 8-10 every 21 day ( total 6 day RO4929097 administration per 21 day cycle ) patient advance breast cancer . II . To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) administration schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacogenetics ( PG ) GDC0449 RO4929097 , alone combination . II . To attempt evaluate select pharmacodynamic ( PD ) stem cell differentiation biomarkers hedgehog notch signaling pathway ( e.g . GLI family zinc finger [ Gli ] 1/2/3 , patch [ Ptch ] 1/2 , hairy enhancer split 1 , [ Drosophila ] [ Hes1 ] , huntingtin interact protein 1 [ Hip1 ] , hairy/enhancer-of-split related YRPW motif 1 [ Hey1 ] , Notch4 , Jagged1 , numb homolog [ Drosophila ] [ numb ] , BMI1 polycomb ring finger oncogene [ Bmi-1 ] , cluster differentiation [ CD ] 44/CD24 , aldehyde dehydrogenase [ ALDH ] proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase [ Src ] family kinase ) percentage breast cancer stem cell ( BCSC ) serial breast tumor biopsy GDC0449 RO4929097 alone 1 cycle treatment combination GDC0449 RO4929097 . III . To determine tumor response patient measurable disease assess Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . IV . To perform molecular profile tumor cell BCSC population GDC0449 RO4929097 alone 1 cycle treatment combination GDC0449 RO4929097 MTD . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 . Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) day 1 day -2 , -1 , 1 course 1 day 1-3 8-10 course 2 subsequent course . Patients also receive vismodegib PO daily ( QD ) begin day 8 course 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
