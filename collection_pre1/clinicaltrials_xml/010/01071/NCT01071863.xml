	<brief_title>Association Fear Falling Physical Activity Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison Before After Biological Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open , observational study determine prevalence fear fall rheumatoid population severe disease consider biological therapy ; compare physical activity level baseline change level pre post treatment biologic therapy . An age sex match control group also study allow inference drawn self report 'fear fall ' objective activity level RA population . The study consist two visit : screening/baseline , 12 week follow visit . It observational study effect plan treatment regime via NHS pathway . The subject eligible enter study receive his/her normal treatment prescribe referral phase biological treatment . The control group continue exist treatment report physical limitation . At screening/baseline visit self completion outcome questionnaire give patient group control group . A disease activity score ( aggregate score RA symptoms - DAS ) RA population calculate nurse specialist time referral biological agent 12 week post treatment , parameter repeat research team DAS score collect used final analysis . In addition , Numact ambulatory activity recorder - use assess spontaneous ambulatory activity - fit 24hour period . This screen / baseline visit occur , near possible 1st treatment day prescribe biological agent . Occasionally record device may fail due extraneous factor ; instance second recording may require . The control group complete study participation immediately screen / baseline visit . The participant follow care pathway treat physician interception study team . The 2nd final study visit schedule 12 week post treatment biologic agent . At 12 week repeat assessment screening procedure make . Beyond study contact patient unless request discussion study finding . If request appointment make time final study report/write . Physical examination could carry time study period consider appropriate physician , however , predict study procedure.. Details change medication adverse event report subject final visit , week 12 .</detailed_description>
