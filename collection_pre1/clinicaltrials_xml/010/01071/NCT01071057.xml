	<brief_title>Naloxone Treatment Opioid-Induced Pruritus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Naloxone co-administered simultaneously standard Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) basal bolus morphine significantly reduce incidence Opioid Induced Pruritus ( OIP ) without affect analgesia opioid consumption child . Specific Objectives : 1 . To determine naloxone ( 12 µg/ml ) mix single infusion morphine ( 1 mg/ml ) effective prevention opioid induce pruritus ( OIP ) . 2 . To determine treatment naloxone result attenuation analgesia increase opioid utilisation . 3 . To determine treatment naloxone reduce opioid induced side effect nausea vomit . Methods : This study divide two phase . Phase 1 - Although , study confirm compatibility morphine ( 4 mg/mL ) naloxone ( 16 µg/mL ) separate infusion pump run intravenous site , study confirm chemical physical compatibility morphine naloxone syringe standard concentration use BCCH . Therefore , compatibility stability study naloxone morphine solution syringe perform . Phase 2 - Phase 2 blind clinical trial 70 subject randomize receive either morphine mix naloxone morphine mixed placebo.With institutional review board approval , write parental/guardian inform consent ( assent appropriate ) , recruit child , age 5-16 year , receive intravenous opioids via PCA post-operative pain control . Subjects evaluate every 4 hr pain score , frequency vomiting , nausea , pruritus , sedation , respiratory depression . At 24 48 hr , total morphine consumption calculate . Data analysis : Differences incidence intensity pruritus two group compare . We review side effect use follow control variable : ( 1 ) demographic data ; ( 2 ) summation opioid use 4 hr period total opioid consumption . ANOVA crosstabs use appropriate analyze data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children 518 year age undergoing surgery BCCH ASA I II . Children receive PCA morphine . Informed consent/assent provide child/parent/guardian . Exclusion Criteria Children know abnormal developmental profile . Children know opioid allergy . Inability/failure obtain informed consent/assent parent/guardian/child . Children receive concurrent opioids . Children preexist pruritus nonopioid relate cause . Children receive PCA hydromorphone fentanyl . ASA 3 . Children require admission Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) . Children involve investigational drug trial within previous one month . Any child study experience unmanageable pruritus within protocol time frame convert hydromorphone continue monitor 48 hour . However , take account statistical analysis study result . Appropriate conventional rescue medication pruritus ( diphenhydramine 0.5mg/kg IV 4hrly PRN ) provide child continue experience pruritus .</criteria>
