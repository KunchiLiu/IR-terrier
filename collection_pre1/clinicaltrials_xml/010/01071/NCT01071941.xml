	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety rRp450 high dose agent give people safely . We also look see well body tolerates study agent , agent absorb liver cancer , quickly agent eliminate body , kind anti-cancer effect may . rRp450 type gene therapy form Herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV ) . HSV virus usually cause cold sore mouth . In extremely rare circumstance , virus cause severe infection , infection brain . rRp450 develop HSV specially alter target kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose study agent administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant liver tumor , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose participant receive depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . - Depending upon participant enrolls study , either receive single injection rRp450 , 4 weekly injection rRp450 . Participants group monitor rRp450 injection hospital clinic . As July , 2013 , first phase study complete , participant forward receive 4 weekly injection rRp450 - For rRp450 injection , insert small tube artery supply blood liver . rRp450 inject tube go directly liver . Another tube insert blood vessel drain blood liver . We use tube take blood sample monitor body absorbs break rRp450 . - After rRp450 injection , participant monitor closely side effect . Vital sign closely monitor , rRp450 injection . After rRp450 injection , tube remove . - The following test procedures do rRp450 injection : determination overall health condition , performance status evaluation , review current medication side effect , physical exam vital sign . - The following test procedures do injection rRp450 : vital sign , review side effect , research blood sample take vein arm , research blood sample take liver vein . - The following test procedures do rRp450 injection : 1 Hour ; blood test : 6 12 hour ; blood test , vital sign , routine blood test , sample saliva swabs skin penis vaginal secretion ( hour 12 ) : 24 hour , Between day 4 7 Between day 10 14 ; review current medication side effect , physical exam , vital sign , routine blood test , swab sample saliva , blood test see body produce antibody HSV-1 ( day 4 7 participant enrol single injection group ) . - Liver tumor biopsy perform 6 day rRp450 injection . - Participants ask return clinic 2 week , 4 week , every 3 month thereafter last injection study medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 year age able understand sign write informed consent form Histologically confirm diagnosis cancer liver metastasis , histologically confirm primary liver cancer ( e.g . hepatocellular carcinoma , cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder carcinoma ) . Subjects may extrahepatic spread malignancy , except may brain metastasis . Subjects history one invasive malignancy remain eligible study , instance , liver biopsy require document histology liver tumor . An exception criterion make basal cell carcinoma . Subjects must primary metastatic liver malignancy surgically unresectable , exhausted standard therapeutic option Patients hepatocellular carcinoma must receive sorafenib one standard treatment option prior enrol study No liver surgery ( include radiofrequency ablation ) , chemotherapy ( include bevacizumab ) , immunotherapy , liver radiotherapy within 4 week enrollment . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 life expectancy great 12 week base investigator 's clinical judgment . Serum hematology chemistry test result outline protocol . Tumor volume occupy less 50 % liver volume assess CT scan MRI scan within 4 week treatment Negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) premenopausal woman Prior exposure HSV1 determine blood test Clinical pathological diagnosis cirrhosis , hemachromatosis , heptic fibrosis Ascites complete occlusion main portal vein Hepatitis C infection , chronic infection hepatitis B , infection HIV , evidence hepatic insufficiency Inability practice contraception condom prescribe protocol Active infection require treatment systemic antibiotic systemic antifungal agent Being treat immunosuppressive agent systemic corticosteroid cyclosporine Unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , need antiarrythmic medication inability take oral preparation regular medication 48 hour would represent unacceptable risk . Known exist uncontrolled coagulopathy , hemorrhagic disorder , inability discontinue coumadin plavix 5 day prior treatment ( except prophylaxis portacathassociated thrombosis , require cessation therapy ) . History seizures Allergy acyclovir inability receive contract CT MRI scan Prior liver resection great 2 anatomic segment define Couinaud ( subject undergone prior liver wedge excision segmental resection exclude basis alone ) .</criteria>
