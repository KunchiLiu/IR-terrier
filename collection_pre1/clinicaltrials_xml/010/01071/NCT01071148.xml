	<brief_summary>The primary objective observational study assess cumulative rate ongoing pregnancy 10 ±2 week hCG administration new series IVF-treatment cycle total 176 subject , undergone three previous IVF-treatment cycle without live birth . Secondary objective include subgroup analysis effect age likelihood pregnancy 10 ±2 week hCG administration new series IVF-treatment cycle patient &lt; 35 year ≥ 35 year , undergone three previous IVF-treatment cycle without live birth . The information obtain trial helpful subject consider IVF treatment IVF centre , well formulation governmental policy regard healthcare reimbursement Norway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IV , Prospective , Observational , Open Label , Single Centre Cohort Trial Conducted Norway During One Year Assess Cumulative Pregnancy Rate New Series In-vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) Treatment Cycles Following Three More Previous IVF Treatment Cycles Without Live Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since IVF process establish 1978 , dramatic increase number IVF treatment cycle perform worldwide . In 2003 , total number report IVF cycle 132,932 725 clinic 28 European country , 7,535 IVF/intra cytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) cycle 24 centre Canada , 100,000 IVF cycle 399 centre U.S. Of assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) procedures available , IVF lead high pregnancy rate per cycle . The degree government reimburse subject IVF treatment varies widely among country Europe North America . In Norway , infertile subject offer maximum three IVF-cycles reimbursed government . If three cycle unsuccessful , subject must pay treatment . This policy might lead subject believe probability achieve pregnancy four cycle low , therefore , worth cost effort . However , number publish study show evidence successful outcome additional IVF-cycles three ( ) cycle negative result . Many study show modest decline success repeat IVF cycle . In addition , preliminary retrospective analysis clinical pregnancy rate subject treat trial centre 2007 show subject , underwent additional one three IVF-treatment cycle , cumulative success rate 52 % ( base clinical experience 62 subject Hausken clinic 2007 ) . Thus , study indicate reasonable chance achieve healthy pregnancy live birth three previous IVF-treatment failure . In fact , age likely important factor number previous IVF treatment failure determine successful outcome . Several study demonstrate old woman low rate conception live birth , high rate pregnancy failure . Treatment subfertility infertility ART IVF embryo transfer ( ET ) require multiple follicular development increase number female gamete , chance successful treatment outcome . Ovarian stimulation IVF/ICSI currently include suppression endogenous luteinising hormone ( LH ) secretion administration gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) analogue , follow stimulation multiple follicular development exogenous follicular stimulate hormone ( FSH ) administration . When adequate follicular development achieve , single dose human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) LH administer mimic endogenous LH surge induce oocyte maturation . A total 176 subject previously undergone three IVF-treatment cycle result live birth undergo new series IVF-treatment cycle use Gonal-f Pergoveris Gonal-f Luveris . Subjects &lt; 35 year ≥ 35 year include . Subgroup analysis take account effect age likelihood success repeat cycle IVF . The investigator systematically follow-up subject observe cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate . The study consist screen period ( ≤-4months ) follow trial assessment make : demographic , medical history , concomitant medication , clinical examination , vital sign , number antral follicle subject diary hand subject . Between screen begin treatment , optional telephone consultation screen information change concomitant medication update . Down-regulation treatment start within 3 month follow screen visit pre treatment period GnRH daily agonist antagonist commercially available Norway , pituitary gonadotrope cell desensitisation . FSH treatment begin administer either Gonal-f Pergoveris Gonal-f Luveris least 2 week GnRH agonist down-regulation . If GnRH antagonist protocol use , FSH injection start Day 2 menstrual cycle . Follicular development monitor accord centre 's standard practice ultrasound and/or estradiol ( E2 ) level , protocol hCG requirement meet ( i.e . least 1 follicle ≥18 mm 2 follicle ≥16 mm ) time subject receive hCG ( Day 0 ) , accord routine practice centre , order induce final oocyte maturation . Ovum Pick Up ( Day 2 ) , IVF , ET ( Day 4-7 ) luteal phase support perform per centre 's standard practice . During treatment period several assessment make adverse event ( AEs ) observe trial record . A urine pregnancy test perform 16 day post hCG administration . In case negative urine pregnancy test , subject assess post-treatment safety follow-up cycle consider 'completed ' . The post-treatment safety follow-up take place simultaneously next cycle 's screening visit . If subject drop , early termination visit replace post-treatment safety follow-up . If urine pregnancy test positive , clinical later ongoing pregnancy subsequently confirm ultrasound scan accord centre 's routine practice . At last visit , subject assess post-treatment safety follow-up consider 'completed ' . Pregnancy outcome pregnant subject optionally follow delivery . Adverse event serious adverse event ( SAEs ) assess spontaneously report subject study visit : optional telephone consultation screen begin treatment , ultrasound scan ( Day -7-0 ) , OPU ( Day 2 ) , telephone consultation ( Day 3 ) , embryo transfer ( Day 4-7 ) , telephone consultation ( Day 16 ) , scan week 12 ( assess 10 week hCG administration ) , post-treatment safety follow-up , 1-Year follow-up , early termination ( applicable ) .</detailed_description>
