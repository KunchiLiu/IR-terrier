	<brief_summary>Background : - Little research do different component cannabis ( marijuana ) appear oral fluid ( i.e. , saliva ) smoking . Cannabinoids well study whole blood , plasma , urine cannabis use , less known cannabinoids appear oral fluid control drug administration long biomarkers last use . In addition , issue stability cannabinoids glucuronide metabolites controversial topic poorly understood . These data critical interpretation cannabinoid test result . Objectives : - To collect whole blood , plasma , urine , oral fluid specimen smoke cannabis , characterize disposition pharmacokinetics cannabinoids multiple biological matrix provide scientifically reliable data stability cannabinoids metabolite . - To test basic brain function thinking process smoke cannabis . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 45 year age use cannabis ( average least twice per month 3 month study . ) Design : - Participants may complete single study session outpatient , may spend night prior and/or follow drug administration residential research unit Baltimore , MD . Participants must provide negative urine drug screen spend even prior test research unit . - Participants provide whole blood , plasma , oral fluid , urine sample , complete several test think brain function start study . - Participants smoke one standardize cannabis cigarette . Blood oral fluid sample collect , participant repeat test think brain function multiple time smoke . - Six hour smoke cigarette , participant must pass neuromotor exam ( test balance coordination ) discharge study . Participants may ask stay overnight clinical center concern safety intoxication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Fluid , Plasma Whole Pharmacokinetics Stability Following Smoked Cannabis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Smoking common route cannabis administration , yet pharmacokinetic property cannabinoids oral fluid follow cannabis smoke adequately characterize . Characterization cannabinoid pharmacokinetics oral fluid , correlation concentration different matrix relationship biomarker concentration concurrent pharmacodynamic effect critical appropriate interpretation cannabinoid test . Furthermore , short- long-term stability cannabinoid biomarkers , include glucuronide conjugate , authentic whole blood , plasma , oral fluid specimen follow cannabis smoke poorly define . The stability data available fortified sample , rather authentic specimen . Objectives : Part A : ( 1 ) Characterize cannabinoid ( -9-tetrahydrocannabinol , [ THC ] ; 11-hydroxy-THC , [ 11-OH-THC ] ; 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC , [ THCCOOH ] ; Phase II conjugate ) pharmacokinetics whole blood , plasma , oral fluid urine follow single smoke dose cannabis . ( 2 ) Determine inter-matrix cannabinoid ratio authentic specimen follow control smoked cannabis ( 3 ) Correlate cannabinoid concentration whole blood , plasma oral fluid impairment risk-taking behavior determine subjective assessment , risk-behavior trait assessment neurocognitive task . ( 4 ) Determine stability time free conjugate cannabinoids authentic whole blood , plasma , oral fluid cannabis user follow single smoke dose cannabis various storage condition . ( 5 ) Characterize sensitivity , specificity , efficiency duration detection cannabinoids Draeger DrugTest 5000 single smoke dose cannabis . Part B : Characterize cannabinoid pharmacokinetics whole blood , plasma , oral fluid , breath , urine follow single smoke dose cannabis . ( 2 ) Characterize sensitivity , specificity , accuracy length detection cannabinoids Draeger DrugTest 5000 single smoke dosed cannabis . ( 3 ) Determine inter-matrix cannabinoid ratio authentic specimen follow control smoked cannabis . ( 4 ) Correlate cannabinoid concentration whole blood , plasma , breath , oral fluid impairment determine subjective assessment neurocognitive task . ( 5 ) Determine stability time free conjugate cannabinoids urine cannabis user follow single smoke dose cannabis various storage condition . Subject Population : Up 50 healthy cannabis user age 18-45 recruited study . In Part A , 10 completers average frequency use least twice per month three month prior study require . In Part B , 10 occasional cannabis smoker average frequency less twice per week past three month 10 chronic frequent cannabis smoker average frequency least four time per week past three month require . Experimental Design Methods : In part A B , participant smoke one standardize NIDA THC cigarette single visit . Serial blood oral fluid collection ( part A B ) breath collection ( part B ) , assessment neurocognitive , physiological subjective effect perform prior multiple time smoke . Outcome Measures : Primary outcome measure part A include cannabinoid concentration whole blood , plasma , oral fluid , stability concentration time , performance neurocognitive task , subjective assessment . Primary outcome measure part B include cannabinoid concentration whole blood , plasma , breath , oral fluid , evaluation DrugTest 5000 correlation cannabinoid breath concentration performance neurocognitive task subjective assessment . An outcome measure subsequent occasional smoker participant 9th completer stability time cannabinoid concentration whole blood plasma collect gray-top Vacutainer tube contain sodium fluoride potassium oxalate . Benefits : There direct benefit participant , study likely yield generalizable knowledge regard cannabinoid pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics Part A Part B . Risks : Participation study represent minimal risk Part A Part B administration smoke cannabis .</detailed_description>
