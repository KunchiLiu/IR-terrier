	<brief_summary>Randomized control multi-center study three arm include 200 patient low risk endometrial hyperplasia . After confirmed diagnosis patient receive one follow treatment : 1 . Provera ( Medroxyprogesterone ( MPA ) /progestin ) 10 mg per oral treatment 6 month 10 day cycle , 2 . MPA 10 mg continuously 6 month , 3 . Mirena ( Levonorgestrel ) impregnate IUD 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Mirena Systemic Progestin Endometrial Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Endometrial cancer common gynecologic cancer Western world incidence still increase . Endometrial cancer principally develop preliminary stage call endometrial hyperplasia 10-30 per cent develop carcinoma leave untreated . The incidence endometrial cancer Norway presently 650 case per year 3000 case endometrial hyperplasia estimate . Thus , correct optimal treatment endometrial hyperplasia contribute prevent endometrial cancer development also long term , reduce incidence endometrial cancer . Correct treatment endometrial hyperplasia include operative treatment hysterectomy high risk case conservative treatment follow patient low risk . As diagnostics endometrial hyperplasia challenge pathologist , overtreatment patient low risk cancer development unfortunately still problem . In present study objective scoring system , D-score , use classify patient low high risk hyperplasia . D-score objective morphometric analysis score system prove reliable predict prognosis single case cancer development . By tradition low risk endometrial hyperplasia treat conservatively progestin hormone , however , national routine really exist accord dose , type progestin , treatment time distribution route , however , vary dos per oral treatment mostly use . Progestins hormone know growth regulatory effect uterine mucosa . However , treatment success per oral therapy show 50 % non-responders per oral treatment . On hand recent study report successful result use LNG-IUD treatment endometrial hyperplasia 100 per cent treatment response . The levonorgestrel impregnate impregnated intrauterine originally construct menorrhagia contraceptive use , deliver hundred time increased concentration progesterone uterine mucosa compare per oral therapy . Thus , favourable treatment attributable increase concentration progestin obtain uterine mucosa . Another advantage treatment last year side-effects see per oral treatment progestin therapy avoid . Inclusion : Most patient present study see gynecologist due irregular bleedings.Biopsy routinely take gynecologist exclude malignancy verify hyperplasia . The biopsy investigate routinely local pathologist . If diagnosis hyperplasia verify patient fulfils inclusion criterion , histological specimen send laboratory Tromsø D-score . When D-score &gt; 0 , patient may include study . D-score : The D-score system divide patient three risk group : 1 . Patients D-score &lt; 0 show high risk cancer development recommend hysterectomy . 2 . Patients D-score &gt; 1 low risk cancer development recommend progestin treatment . 3 . Patients D-score 0-1 uncertain risk cancer development may treat conservatively . Only patient D-score &gt; 0 may include study . Randomization : When gynecologist receive diagnosis D-score result D-score accordance inclusion criterion , patient ask gynecologist include study . If consent give , randomization perform telephone contact randomization office , UNN , Tromsø , write informed consent . The patient free leave study time without argument . Treatment : After randomization treatment accord assign treatment arm start . During therapy period patient control repeat biopsy 3 month end treatment 6 month . D-score repeat hyperplasia persists . If negative D-score perform , patient leave study . If D-score still positive patient also leave study , new therapy decide local gynecologist . Control : All patient control repeat biopsy every six month two year end therapy . If recurrence hyperplasia occur patient leave study receive therapy decide gynecologist repeat D-score . Side effect : All side effect related treatment treatment and/or follow-up report .</detailed_description>
