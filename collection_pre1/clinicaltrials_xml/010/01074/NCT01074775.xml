	<brief_summary>The approach use employ measurement activation white blood cell , look pattern response control infection gut Mycobacterium bovis . M. bovis conveniently obtain safe pure form oral vaccine . By give three challenge M bovis gut , simulate repeat gut infection organism . We compare activation cell blood immune response see challenge , determine whether non-specific defence gut block subsequent infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The approach use employ immune readouts genomics look patterns response control infectious challenge human gut . Genomics use 'Affymetrix ' gene array , technique determine profile gene expression . When gene 'switched ' make mRNA body use template make protein . We extract mRNA white blood cell , infection . The gene chip hundred thousand mini-sensors measure much mRNA particular gene present sample . Thus begin see gene switch , unaffected , inside white blood cell stag develop innate immune response . This allow u monitor body 's response infection see family gene important different stage gut infection . The BCG vaccine derive Mycobacterium bovis ( full name organism Mycobacterium bovis Baccille Calmette Guérin ) . In study propose use oral BCG preparation , produce prophylactic therapeutic oral vaccine , safe model natural gut infection pathogenic Mycobacterium bovis . The cell wall mycobacteria BCG powerful immune adjuvant ( adjuvant substance enhances immune response ) lipid , sugar protein cell wall interact strongly molecules innate immune system . It therefore provide safe highly effective way stimulate innate immunity 'natural ' condition gut infection . This first model select reflect 'real world ' high priority area disease prevention , high level safety reproducibility oral BCG model . By carefully deliver oral BCG challenge healthy volunteer control condition , reduce noise background activity proteomic genomic assay use profile develop innate immune response . We check BCG indeed colonise 'infected ' subject measure specific adaptive T cell antibody responses use sensitive assay develop previous study detect immune response . This critical aspect study : detect BCG-specific T cell response assure 'infection ' take place , interpret profile see immunology genomics . If see immune response relate innate immune activation colonisation BCG . In contrast , even see immune response , sure vaccine deliver properly viable formulation ( adhere strict Good Clinical Practice ) look feature genomic proteomic profile baseline measurement infection may predict failure organism infect . By collect data event intercurrent illness , adverse event also determine whether change proteomic gene expression profile indeed due model infection , extraneous event . This preliminary study enable u refine expensive technique , protocol assay let u focus detail subsequent study This study conduct accord Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) St George 's Vaccine Institute . Up 10 subject include study . The study consist pre-study screen visit 23 visit period 12 month time indicate schedule investigation .</detailed_description>
