	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose intraperitoneal bortezomib give together intraperitoneal carboplatin treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer persistent come back . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Bortezomib may help carboplatin work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Infusing bortezomib carboplatin directly abdomen ( intraperitoneal ) may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraperitoneal Bortezomib Carboplatin Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) intraperitoneal ( IP ) bortezomib ( BTZ ) administer intraperitoneal carboplatin woman epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer persistent recurrent fail primary therapy least one second-line therapy . II . To examine safety administer BTZ combination carboplatin IP route . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective tumor response rate determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . II . To determine pharmacokinetic profile BTZ carboplatin administer intraperitoneally every 21 day . III . To characterize frequency carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction ( HSR ) administer intraperitoneal infusion context recurrent ovarian cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study bortezomib . Patients receive bortezomib intraperitoneally ( IP ) carboplatin IP day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
