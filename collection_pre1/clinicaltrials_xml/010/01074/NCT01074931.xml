	<brief_summary>This post-marketing observational study conduct obtain data clinical , biological virological outcome , compliance tolerability use lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) -containing regimen treatment naïve experience patient infected human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) China . Although LPV/r frequently use world-wide , evaluation outcome , compliance , tolerance anti-HIV strategy real life still major challenge management HIV-infected patient life-long therapy , especially China . This study help develop effectiveness safety profile lopinavir/ritonavir contain regimen Chinese HIV-1 infected patient , provide choice anti-HIV-1 strategy Chinese expert benefit Chinese HIV-1 infect patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It plan enroll approximately 100 patient total . This multicenter post-marketing observational study China mainland . Each patient observe his/her lopinavir/ritonavir - contain treatment regimen maximum period 18 month . If physician decides permanently discontinue lopinavir/ritonavir end plan observational period 18 month , reason discontinuation new treatment regimen prescribe document . The next routine follow-up visit termination visit patient study . This post-marketing observational study conduct prospective , single-arm , multicenter format . As study observational nature , follow-up interventional left judgment physician within 18-month period , defines survey patient . For indicative purpose , follow-up patient enable approximately 4 patient visit period . These visit take place average interval 6 month , apart first visit follow inclusion ( usually end first 3 treatment month ) apart visit require intercurrent event . If treatment lopinavir/ritonavir discontinue , standard practice review patient period 3 month . For reason , likely visit define `` V1 '' , `` V2 '' , `` V3 '' , `` V4 '' although number date depend decision physician . As result , failure meet suggest date constitute deviation protocol .</detailed_description>
