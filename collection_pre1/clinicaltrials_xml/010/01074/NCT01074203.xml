	<brief_summary>Recurrence Hepatitis C virus infection ( HCV ) universal orthotopic liver transplantation ( LTx ) associate allograft failure , death need re-transplantation . Currently , effective therapy prevent HCV recurrence . Nitazoxanide ( NTZ ) , oral thiazolide anti-infectious agent , safe , well tolerated effective achieving sustain viral response patient chronic HCV genotype 4 . Its role prevention HCV recurrence liver transplantation study . The investigator propose conduct open label pilot study examine role NTZ prevention HCV re-infection eight patient undergoing LTx . First time transplant recipient chronic HCV without history renal failure HIV/HBV co-infection , receive NTZ immediately prior LTx 3 day thereafter . The primary endpoint number patient remain HCV-RNA-negative day 7 LTx . If least one patient remain negative , study determine positive . Additionally , investigator examine viral kinetics HCV , tolerability safety NTZ .</brief_summary>
