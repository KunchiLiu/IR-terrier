	<brief_summary>In research study look see effective BIBW 2992 suppress development T790M mutation non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) proteins found surface cancer cell promote growth signal . Some cancer drug NSCLC work block signal reaching target cancer cell turn may slow stop cancer grow . However , many time patient EGFR mutation stop respond cancer drug develop drug-resistance develop specific EGFR mutation call T790M . BIBW 2992 prevent T790M mutation become active therefore slow disease progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants take table BIBW 2992 day cycle . Each cycle 28 day ( 4 week ) . - Participants come clinic Day 1 , 8 15 Cycle 1 . For Cycle 2 8 , woll need come clinic Day 1 . After Cycle 8 , study visit every 2 month . - The following test procedure perform clinic visit : physical examination , routine blood test , research blood sample , EKG ( every fourth cycle start cycle 5 ) , ECHO MUGA ( every fourth cycle start cycle 5 ) , assessment fo tumor CT MRI scan ( every 8 week ) . - Participants may continue participate research study long tumor grow disease worsen severe side effect . - Participants tumor biopsy perform end participation study tumor grow new tumor . The purpose biopsy ass presence absence mutation T790M .</detailed_description>
