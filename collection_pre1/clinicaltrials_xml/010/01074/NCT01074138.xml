	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study KX2-391 Patients With Bone-Metastatic , Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Not Received Prior Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , single-arm , open-label , prospective phase II clinical trial evaluate efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics orally administer KX2-391 adult male patient progressive bone-metastatic CRPC . Patients must 1 ) document bone-metastatic prostate cancer , 2 ) castrate level testosterone , 3 ) receive prior chemotherapy , 4 ) document disease progression base rise PSA , progressive measurable visceral disease and/or progressive bone lesion ( one criterion sufficient ) per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group ( PCWG2 ) guideline ( Scher et al 2008 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must provide sign informed consent prior perform studyrelated procedure ; The patient must histologically cytologically confirm prostate adenocarcinoma ; The patient must presence least one document osseous metastasis bone scan ; The patient must castrate testosterone level &lt; 50ng/dl within 4 week prior initiation KX2391 treatment . If chemically castrate , patient must also agree stay luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonist medication duration study ; The patient must document disease progression evidence one follow 3 criterion : Rising PSA , define three rise PSA value ≥ 2 week apart 3rd value 2ng/ml great ( historical value may use ) . Rising PSA must see 3rd value relative 2nd value AND 2nd value relative 1st value ( i.e . two consecutive rise time muse note ) . Given potential fluctuation PSA value , one drop rise PSA value time may see determine eligibility . Pretherapy PSA double time may also calculate ( 3 value 4 week apart .
