	<brief_title>An Observational Study Examine Patients With Isolated Systolic Hypertonia ( ISH ) Under Therapy With Eneas® ( NIS ENEAS ISH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Isolated systolic hypertonia autonomous form hypertonia , 73 % case develop normal blood pressure ( BP ) situation . A strict BP control especially important old people , since incidence ISH also increase increase age . This attributed elasticity vessel reduce age . Systolic Hypertension Elderly Program ( SHEP ) study show ISH independent cardiovascular risk factor . Eneas combination angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor enalapril maleate ( 10 mg ) calcium antagonist nitrendipine ( 20 mg ) . Irrespective fact show different study , calcium-antagonists also ACE inhibitor especially distinctive potential degeneration left-ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) . Examinations like SYST-EUR-study demonstrate high therapeutic potential combination nitrendipine enalapril old hypertonia subject . It proven multicentric , double-blind , randomise placebo control study , additional dose enalapril ( necessary diuretic administer ) subject ISH 60 year treatment nitrendipine case sufficient lower BP , total incidence cardiac event ( heart failure , ischaemic heart disease sudden heart fall ) reduce 26 % within two year treatment . As part SYST-EUR study , reduction incidence vascular dementia 50 % document so-called `` Vascular Dementia Project '' standardise psychometric measuring system . This effect probably attribute alone lower BP , also additive ZNS-protective effect nitrendipine enalapril . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To observe course disease subject ISH , treat Eneas . In case , particular attention give achievement target value lower systolic BP value ( &lt; 140 mmHg ) within 6 month treatment time period . Secondary objective : - To examine systolic well diastolic BP situation total medication , especially medication therapy ISH across treatment duration - To collect drug security data examine subject group practical condition The examination plan study include approximately examination give , whereby time individual examination subject exclusively clinical requirement usual convention centre : - Examination begin treatment ( Visit 1 ) - Control examination approximately 3 month ( Visit 2 ) - Control examination approximately 6 month ( Visit 3 )</detailed_description>
