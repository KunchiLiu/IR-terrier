	<brief_title>Pilot Study Using Molecular Profiling Find Potential Targets Select Treatments Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine percent patient refractory breast cancer molecular profile RPMA-based protein pathway activation analysis tumor , change clinical course disease ( i.e . produce Growth Modulation Index ( GMI ) ≥1.3 ) . The GMI calculate ratio Progression-free survival ( PFS ) molecular profile RPMA analysis select treatment time progression ( TTP ) recent regimen patient progress .</detailed_description>
