	<detailed_description>The hypothesized sequence event inflammatory acne start formation microcomedone accumulation cornified keratinocytes within follicle . Presence and/or proliferation P.acnes induces production IL-1 alpha , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - alpha , IL-8 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . Inflammation cause CD4+ T cell cause T-helper 1 cytokine response mediate Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) -2 TLR-4 whose expression increase P. acne . Infiltration neutrophils appear 72 hr , possible disruption follicular wall inflammation . TNF-alpha liberate keratinocytes stimulates activation pro-matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 activity dermis remodel fibroblast consequence possible scarring . The usual treatment moderate severe inflammatory acne involve use long-term topical retinoids antibiotic doxycycline minocycline show decrease inflammatory response well decrease population P. acne . Since acne long term condition , several year antibiotic usually require . Recently , problematic antibiotic overuse receive great attention concern . Chronic antibiotic use implicate increase risk breast cancer upper respiratory infection , also concern antibiotic resistance . Recent recommendation Global Alliance Improve Outcomes Acne Group include limitation use oral antibiotic maximum 3 month . So need find alternative include use oral antibiotic . The effective available treatment severe acne isotretinoin may potential serious side effect . Lately also implicate development depression suicidal ideation teenager population . A novel anti-inflammatory , antibiotic drug may excellent alternative treatment moderate severe acne . Apremilast show inhibit production tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , IL-8 neutrophil infiltration , elevate inflammatory acne . Preliminary data use Apremilast psoriasis make u believe medication safe short-term use acne patient . Our intention study Apremilast treatment moderate severe acne .</detailed_description>
