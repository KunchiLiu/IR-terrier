	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . Safety Run-in first 12 patient study ( 6 cohort 1 6 cohort 2 ) . Patients safety run include efficacy analysis intent treat basis : Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 week x 4 cycle ; Rucaparib 16-30 mg IV D 1,2,3 every 3 week x 4 cycle If cycle 1 well tolerate , dose Rucaparib escalate 16 mg 24 mg subsequent cycle cohort 1 , 24 mg 30 mg cohort 2 . If ≤ 1 6 patient cohort 1 experience DLT , cohort 2 commence . If 2 6 patient cohort 1 experience DLT , study suspend amendment explore low dos consider . If ≤ 1 6 patient cohort 2 experience DLT , randomize portion study commence . If 2 6 patient experience DLT , study suspend amendment proceed randomize portion cohort 2 dose ( 24 mg ) consider . During randomized portion study , patient randomize either Arm A Arm B. Stratification factor : - Anthracycline vs. - Residual LN involvement vs. No Residual LN involvement Arm A ( Cisplatin Monotherapy ) Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 week x 4 cycle Arm B ( Combination Therapy ) Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 week x 4 cycle ; Rucaparib 16-30 mg IV D1,2,3 every 3 week x 4 cycle Rucaparib maintenance 30 mg IV weekly x 24 week ECOG Performance Status 0-1 Life Expectancy : Not Specified Hematopoietic : - Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9.0 g/dL - Platelets &gt; 100 K/ mm3 - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1.5 K/mm3 Hepatic : - Bilirubin &lt; upper limit normal ( except patient document Gilbert 's disease , must total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT , SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN Renal : - Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 cc/min use Cockcroft-Gault formula Cardiovascular : - Left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limit . - Patients unstable angina myocardial infarction within 12 month study entry exclude . - No clinically significant arrhythmia baseline ECG abnormalities opinion treat investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must histologically cytologically confirm triple negative ( ER/PR/HER2 ) invasive breast cancer , stage IIII diagnosis ( AJCC 6th edition ) base initial evaluation clinical examination and/or breast imaging . NOTE : Patients ER+ and/or PR+ may enroll ONLY known carrier deleterious mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 . Patients HER2+ tumor may enroll regardless BRCA status . Must complete preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy . NOTE : Acceptable preoperative regimen include anthracycline taxane , . Patients may NOT receive cisplatin part neoadjuvant therapy regimen . Patients receive preoperative therapy part clinical trial may enroll . No adjuvant chemotherapy surgery specify protocol allow . Adjuvant bisphosphonate use allow . Must complete definitive resection primary tumor . The last surgery breast cancer must complete least 14 day prior registration protocol therapy . Must significant residual invasive disease time definitive surgery follow preoperative chemotherapy . Significant residual disease define least one following : MillerPayne response breast 025 . Residual Cancer Burden ( RBC ) classification II III6 Residual carcinoma one regional lymph node would meet AJCC 6th edition criterion N1 N3 disease . Alternatively , MillerPayne RCB grade available , patient eligible pathology report indicate area residual invasive disease breast measure least 2 cm follow preoperative therapy . The presence DCIS without invasion qualify residual disease breast . Whole breast radiotherapy require patient underwent breast conserve therapy , include lumpectomy partial mastectomy . Patients receive adjuvant radiation therapy must complete radiotherapy least 14 day prior registration protocol therapy . Written inform consent HIPAA authorization release personal health information . Age &gt; 18 year time consent . Must consent allow submission archive tumor tissue sample definitive surgery . Must consent collection blood sample PK analysis . Women childbearing potential male must willing use effective method contraception time consent sign 4 week treatment discontinuation . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day prior registration protocol therapy . Women must breastfeed . No stage IV ( metastatic ) disease , however specific stag study require absence symptom physical exam finding would suggest distant disease . No treatment investigational agent within 30 day prior registration protocol therapy . No history chronic hepatitis B C No clinically significant infection judge treat investigator .</criteria>
