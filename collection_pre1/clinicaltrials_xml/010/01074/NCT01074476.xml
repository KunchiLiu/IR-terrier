	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common joint disease associate age . Although many patient take glucosamine supplement non-traditional treatment osteoarthritis , effectiveness supplement questionable . This study evaluate glucosamine therapy directly analyze two function joint fluid impair osteoarthritis - namely , ability lubricate joint absorb shock activity . Joint fluid sample collect subject knee osteoarthritis analyzed device simulates typical joint movement . After 3 month glucosamine supplementation , sample collect detect potential improvement joint fluid function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The effectiveness glucosamine sulphate treatment OA still debate . Most clinical trial evaluate effectiveness OA treatment self-administered questionnaire joint pain , stiffness function ( Lequesne Algofunctional Index , Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index - WOMAC ) . Although OA show reduce viscosity viscoelasticity synovial fluid , study use property objective outcome measure assessment glucosamine therapy . The purpose study investigate whether glucosamine sulphate oral supplement improve viscous viscoelastic property synovial fluid osteoarthritis patient explore potential correlation property subjective assessment joint pain function . Research Method : Patients invited participate study recommend synovial fluid aspiration relieve joint discomfort cause effusion . Subjects randomly assign receive either 1500mg glucosamine sulphate placebo daily 3 month . To relieve pain , subject allow take 4000 mg acetaminophen per day . If insufficient , NSAIDS permit maximum period 5 consecutive day . Subjects ask keep log analgesic consumption . At baseline visit , patient demographic record subject ask complete WOMAC index questionnaire , include 24 question evaluate joint pain , stiffness physical function . After note degree joint effusion ( minor , moderate , severe ) , experienced physician aspirate synovial fluid study knee relieve joint pressure . A sample collect analysis viscosity viscoelasticity . Followup visit schedule every 4 week 3-month study period . Each visit include completion WOMAC questionnaire , clinical assessment degree joint effusion aspiration synovial fluid ( necessary ) characterization . Any adverse event ( headache , abdominal pain , allergic episode ) also report physician . Changes synovial fluid viscosity viscoelasticity determine 3 month glucosamine supplementation compare placebo group . Correlations synovial fluid property WOMAC score also describe .</detailed_description>
