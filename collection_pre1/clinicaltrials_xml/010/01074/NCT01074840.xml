	<brief_summary>The purpose study find way treat child peanut allergy help low risk severe allergic reaction also cause lose allergy peanut understand happen immune system viral infection therapy . The approach use treat peanut allergy study process call desensitization . We think child peanut allergy receive peanut oral immunotherapy able eat peanut without reaction end study could eat begin . We also think able measure change immune system immune system 's response viruses therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Understanding How Immune System Responds Viruses Peanut Allergic Children Undergoing Peanut Oral Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy know cause severe anaphylactic reaction . Compared food allergy tend persistent also prevalence seem rise . Currently prove treatment strict avoidance . We attempt decrease risk anaphylaxis accidental ingestion desensitize subject peanut use peanut oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) . We also study effect viral infection immune system child receive peanut OIT . Children age three sixteen year age peanut allergy give peanut OIT . Twenty-five subject also recruit control . These subject receive peanut placebo skin prick test lab work addition history physical exam . Active subject undergo double-blind food challenge entry verify allergic peanut . If allergic , modify rush immunotherapy first day increase dos least every two week maintenance dose 4 gram ( equivalent 13 peanut ) . Doses take daily home except dose increase do Children 's Medical Center . Outcome variables interest include response double-blind placebo control food challenge , skin prick testing , peanut specific IgE , adverse event . These result compare start end peanut OIT use appropriate statistical analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 3 16 year either sex , race , ethnicity , weigh least 18.3 kg time initial visit . The presence IgE specific peanut ( positive skin prick test peanut ( diameter wheal &gt; 3.0 mm ) positive vitro IgE ( CAPFEIA ) &gt; 7 kU/L ) measure within past year . Significant clinical symptom occur within 60 minute ingest peanut observe DoubleBlind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge . Provide sign informed consent . Ability followup regularly schedule appointment . Females childbearing potential must willing practice acceptable form birth control throughout protocol . History severe anaphylaxis peanut define hypoxia , hypotension , neurological compromise ( Cyanosis SpO2 &lt; 92 % stage , hypotension , confusion , collapse , loss consciousness ; incontinence ) Currently participate study use investigational new drug . Participation interventional study treatment food allergy past 12 month participate study . Subjects know oat wheat ( potential cross contamination oat ) food allergy exclude Poor control persistent activation atopic dermatitis . Diagnosis asthma currently treat daily dos inhale corticosteroid require rescue inhaler 2 day per week . Inability discontinue antihistamine skin test Oral Food Challenges ( OFCs ) .
