	<brief_summary>High variability blood sugar level high incidence night-time hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) young people type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) make achieve treatment goal population extremely challenge . Our ongoing research focus development closed-loop glucose control child adolescent T1D . The three component closed-loop system continuous glucose monitor , insulin pump , computer-based algorithm . The study perform thus far evaluated efficacy safety overnight closed-loop glucose control . The result show overnight closed-loop improve control blood glucose prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia , compare conventional insulin pump therapy . The next objective evaluate efficacy safety closed-loop insulin delivery prolonged time period , include daytime , normal living activity occur . This pave way comprehensive use close loop system control glucose level T1D . The present study adopts open-label , randomised , 2-period cross-over design whereby safety efficacy closed-loop insulin therapy compare conventional insulin pump therapy 12 adolescent T1D . Participants age 12 18 year randomise two 36 hour study clinical research facility , glucose level control either computer-based closed-loop algorithm ( intervention arm ) conventional insulin pump therapy ( control arm ) . During study participant perform normal daily activity , i.e . playing , reading , snack physical activity . On occasion , Actiheart , combine heart rate movement sensor use accurately quantify subject 's individual physical activity energy expenditure 36 hour study period 36 hour free living weekday .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study open-label , randomise , 2-period crossover study compare closed-loop insulin therapy conventional insulin pump therapy 12 adolescent type 1 diabetes . Subjects consent take part study attend Clinical Research Facility two occasion , last 36 hour . Approximately 1-3 day prior Study Visit , subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device insert . On Study Visit subject arrive 17:30 18:00 stay clinical research facility two night . Shortly arrival subject Actiheart monitor fit cannula insert vein one arm blood sampling purpose . Blood sample plasma glucose plasma insulin start 18:30 carry 30 minute interval day 60min interval night throughout study period . Plasma glucose measurement do real time every 30min day every 60min night except plasma glucose &lt; 3.5mmol/L follow treatment hypoglycaemia , measurement carry every 15 minute . On Study Visit 1 subject randomise arrival receive either conventional insulin pump therapy closed-loop intervention . At 18:30 subject perform 5 10 minute exercise bicycle determine setting need achieve heart rate 140 bpm correspond exercise level 55 % 60 % peak VO2 . In closed-loop intervention arm insulin pump therapy drive computer-based algorithm 19:30 end study . The basal insulin infusion rate insulin pump adjust manually 15min interval follow computer-based algorithm advice . During control arm , subject carry usual insulin pump regimen . In group CGM continue throughout whole study period . Subjects complete Study Visit 1 cross alternative Study Visit schedule interval 1 6 week .</detailed_description>
