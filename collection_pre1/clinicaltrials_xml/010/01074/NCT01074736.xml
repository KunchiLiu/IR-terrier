	<brief_summary>The identification characterization susceptibility loci H5N1 infection human could profound implication . The detection host genetic factor may shed light key pathogenic interaction H5N1 human cell , assist identify viral characteristic determine pandemic potential . In addition , identification verification susceptibility locus would follow functional study might point way new therapeutic preventive option . The objective study investigate host genetic factor associate susceptibility influenza H5N1 illness</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This primarily hypothesis screen exercise guess base biological plausibility possible , comprehensive analysis genetic susceptibility achieve whole genome approach . Therefore test genetic linkage association use large number Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) span whole genome . Principal Investigators access information survive deceased laboratory confirm H5N1 case . These case form study base . The epidemiologist attempt make telephone contact either recover patient , patient die , close relative decease patient . The propose study explain permission seek epidemiologist study nurse visit household explain study great detail , offer opportunity question , subject agrees , obtain informed consent participation . If epidemiologist difficulty make contact case family local public authority ask assist make contact . Eligible family member H5N1 case identify face-to-face interview survive confirm case close family member decease case .</detailed_description>
