	<brief_summary>The study base premise ultrasound commonly use ambulance . There department deploy field , departments almost data collect use . Currently Paramedics recognize insurance company health care provider capable perform ultrasound . If data subject may eventually change . We hop prove ultrasound useful ambulance , paramedic good interpreting result . We save image , paramedic 's diagnosis basic information call . We save protect health information ( PHI ) information link subject study . The data collect sent non-biased ultrasound reviewer grade image accuracy diagnosis quality view obtain . This data use formulate report statistic paramedic 's ability perform ultrasound field .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Keller Prehospital Ultrasound Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last 30 year ultrasound contribute greatly many field medicine , emergency medicine exception . In fact emergency medicine currently one fast grow us ultrasound technology . Just 12 lead machine become widely popular many ER 's 25 year ago find way prehospital environment . There many doubt ability train paramedic read 12 lead necessity prehospital 12 lead . However recent study show paramedic par physician ability interpret STEMI 's . And many paramedic could fathom system without 12 lead . If paramedic train interpret something complex 12 lead , possible train paramedic interpret ultrasound . With advance ultrasound technology create light , small , cheap , durable machine , reason put valuable technology prehospital field . With expanded role prehospital field , 12 lead move convenience become real tool ability activate emergency heart cath team field bypass ER save precious minute door balloon time . The ultrasound could soon alert surgical team positive internal bleeding , rupture ectopic pregnancy , operable AAA bypass ER go straight surgery . This intervention could life save presence injury . And add usefulness , ultrasound also help gain intravenous access , determine endotracheal tube placement , detect pacemaker capture determine myriad less acute disease process . PURPOSE : 1 . To determine utility ultrasound prehospital emergency environment suburban city . 2 . To determine ability teach dual role firefighter paramedic multiple us ultrasound prehospital environment . 3 . To determine ability dual role firefighter paramedic accurately rapidly perform ultrasound field HYPOTHESIS : - The use ultrasound field dual role firefighter paramedic poorly study - The use ultrasound suburban environment poorly study - Ultrasound perform clinically significant patient population - A wide array ultrasound procedure teach quickly reliably perform field paramedic prior ultrasound experience - The use ultrasound field play significant role guide field presentation patient - Just 12 lead , bring ultrasound field lead significantly well patient care DETAILS : - The study carry city population approx . 35000 non trauma hospital 15 minute away trauma center 30 minute away . - The main priority study interfere patient care - The study conduct Keller Fire Station 4 , C shift Medic 584 PROCESS : - The procedure teach shift test skill lab - The ultrasound exam perform paramedic patient place ambulance . - Paramedics record still image ultrasound view future review approve EM ultrasound reviewer . The paramedic read ultrasound result record . If paramedic feel ultrasound show positive result report run report . - The time take ultrasound perform record difficulty perform exam note . - Any hospital diverts occur , result ultrasound record . - Electronic image save scan , interpretation log sheet fill . Scans over-read blinded fashion certify emergency medical ultrasound physician . Studies score technical adequacy well image quality . - The interpretation ultrasound director compare EMS provider , proportion adequate study assess . - Performance pre post write image-based test assess training . PROTOCOLS : PRIMARY EXAMS - We perform E-FAST exam trauma patient possible injury abdomen thorax , mechanism indicate need exam , paramedic 's discretion - We perform pregnancy exam female abdominal pain patient child bear age - We perform ultrasound guide venous access patient IV access difficult patient 's condition require IV access indicate need IO , procedure do paramedic discretion . - We perform AAA exam patient possible diagnosis AAA . Measurements take compare hospital measurement available . - We perform cardiac echo patient cardiac arrest possible PEA detract patient care . SECONDARY EXAMS - We perform renal ultrasound patient flank pain check hydronephrosis . Positive finding document . - We check pleural effusion patient decrease SpO2 unknown etiology , especially know renal hepatic disease - We determine ETT placement via ultrasound every intubation possible - We check mechanical capture transcutaneous cardiac pacing</detailed_description>
