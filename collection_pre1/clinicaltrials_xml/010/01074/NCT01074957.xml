	<brief_summary>Background : Although respiratory physiotherapy use patient undergoing cardiac surgery , evidence lack concern effectiveness . The aim study evaluate efficacy three physiotherapeutic protocol use recover respiratory volume postoperative period . Methods : Thirty five patient randomly allocate three group . Exercise group ( E ) orient progressive mobilization . Incentive Spirometry group ( IS ) perform deep breathing use VoldyneTM , Breath-Stacking group ( BS ) perform successive inspiratory effort use facial mask adapt unidirectional valve . Both BS IS also perform progressive mobilization . Forced spirometry carry pre-operative period first fifth postoperative day . Statistical analysis use student t-test ANOVA , difference consider significant p &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , control randomized clinical trial , conduct patient undergo cardiac surgery Hospital de Força Aérea Galeão ( HFAG - Rio de Janeiro , RJ , Brazil ) . According Helsinki declaration , protocol approve UNISUAM Ethics Committee ( process : 15/2007 ) write informed consent obtain participant . All patient HFAG , schedule cardiac surgery November 2007 February 2009 eligible participate study . Patients include follow criterion present : informed consent could obtain , could perform preoperative test , cognitive impairment perform IS , intolerance use BS mask . Exclusion criterion include : hemodynamic complication ( intraoperative myocardial infarction , major blood loss , mark hypotension , reduce cardiac output require use intra-aortic balloon pump extraordinary use medication ) intubation period longer 72 hour follow arrival intensive care unit . In patient surgical procedure median sternotomy , postoperative routine , include optimal treatment pain control . A verbal pain score obtain use visual analog scale patient initiated physiotherapeutic treatment first postoperative day , follow extubation . Demographic data , clinical history preoperative risk factor record . In preoperative period patient instructed importance early mobilization excessive bronchial secretion removal . Patients teach huff ( force expiration glottis open ) , support cough ( patient 's hand place sternotomy incision ) mobilization , include active limb exercise , sit bed deambulation ( start third postoperative day ) . Then , randomly allocate three group . Exercise group ( E ) perform procedure describe . Incentive Spirometry group ( IS ) orient take deep breathing Voldyne 5000TM ( Sherwood Medical ; St Loius , MO , USA ) Functional Residual Capacity ( FRC ) Total Lung Capacity ( TLC ) . Breath-Stacking group ( BS ) perform inspiratory effort use facial mask adapt unidirectional valve . Since mask set allow inspiration ( expiratory branch occlude ) , patient carry successive inspiratory effort period 20 second . Then , expiratory branch release allow exhalation . These three treatment apply five day , three series five maneuver twice day . Patients management similar among group term assessment , mobilization protocol cough orientation . For safety purpose , vital sign oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) monitor throughout intervention . SpO2 measure continuously seven minute use portable pulse oximeter ( Model 2500A , Nonin Medical INC ; Plymouth , USA ) patient breathe room air . After seven minute consistent value 30 second record previous oxygen therapy reinitiated . If assessment , patient 's SpO2 drop 85 % , oxygen recommence register . All procedure perform supervision experience physical therapist . Forced spirometry carry preoperative period first fifth postoperative day , use Pony Fx® spirometer ( Cosmed ; Rome , Italy ) . A Wright® ventilometer ( British Oxygen Company ; London , England ) properly attach Voldyne Breath-Stacking mask , allow measure Inspiratory Capacity ( IC ) procedure . Postoperative risk evaluate mean Torrington Scale , use clinical functional data . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis do use Sigma Stat 3.1 ( Jandel Scientific , San Rafael , CA , USA ) . Data present average standard error mean . They present normal distribution ( Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Lilliefors ' correction ) homogeneous variance ( Levene median test ) . Comparisons FVC IS , BS E do ANOVA , follow Tukey test whenever multiple comparison require . Student 's t-test use compare IC IS BS . The significance level always set 5 % .</detailed_description>
