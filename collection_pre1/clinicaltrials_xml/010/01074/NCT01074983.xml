	<detailed_description>Trauma patient United States frequently receive high-flow high-concentration supplemental oxygen pre-hospital setting , yet physiologic need rarely know . Providing oxygen everyone regardless need may seem straightforward , practice extensive implication logistically challenge area combat arena mass casualty event , support care guideline . Indeed , much oxygen harmful patients.1 , 2 If case , trauma patient require oxygen , would decrease logistical burden provide oxygen pre-hospital environment . No study yet perform describes proportion patient require oxygen , amount oxygen require , whether oxygen beneficial outcomes . This prospective observational cohort investigation aim bridge knowledge gap surround need possible benefit harm arise oxygen therapy . In Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) system , write standard care provide oxygen maintain oxygen saturation 95 % hemorrhagic shock traumatic brain injury suspected.3 We observe pattern oxygen treatment outcome patient treat accord write standard care , compare treatment outcome patient transport EMS unit continue usual practice pattern . Specifically , aim : 1 . Identify proportion trauma patient hypoxemic traumatic brain injury hemorrhagic shock time initial EMS contact 2 . Identify proportion trauma patient develop hypoxemia hemorrhagic shock pre-hospital set 3 . Identify difference clinically important outcome associate treatment driven write standard care compare usual practice pattern EMS unit . These outcome include requirement advance airway management , hospital intensive care unit lengths stay , disposition ( include in-hospital 30-day mortality ) 4 . Determine amount oxygen ( Liters per minute ) require reverse hypoxemia</detailed_description>
