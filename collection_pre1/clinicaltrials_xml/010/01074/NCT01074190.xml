	<brief_summary>A previous randomize trial show possible negative association labor neuraxial analgesia high compare low dos fentanyl , breastfeed 6 week postpartum . The significance study would validate refute finding . In addition , hope good evaluate impact cumulative dose fentanyl breastfeed success initial postpartum period well 6 week 6 month post delivery . In order better ass quality breastfeeding , utilize validate breastfeed assessment tool , LATCH ( Latch , Audible swallowing , Type Nipple , Comfort , Help ) . This validated tool assess maternal infant variable , define area need intervention , determine priority provide patient teaching . The LATCH assessment show predictor breastfeed duration . We also plan vary dosage fentanyl analgesia determine relationship dose 150 microgram change breastfeed assessment . If clear association decrease breastfeed total fentanyl identify , regimens reduce cumulative dos fentanyl develop improve likelihood breastfeed success mother desire breastfeed . Prior observational study infer epidural negatively affect breastfeed decrease maternal plasma oxytocin release may adversely affect infant neurobehavioral development . In study Beilin et al. , report mother receive high cumulative dose ( &gt; 150 microgram ) epidural fentanyl likely stop nurse 6 week postpartum compare group receive fentanyl receive &lt; 150 microgram . The study however , underpowered detect difference breastfeed prior hospital discharge . In addition , breastfeed assessment tool utilize result binary assessment , therefore , global rating quality breastfeed available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants study ask complete questionnaire call Intrinsic Motivation Inventory ( IMI ) . Subjects randomize time request neuraxial analgesia one three group : Group 1 : patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) bupivacaine 1mg/mL ; Group 2 : PCEA fentanyl 1 mcg/mL plus bupivacaine 0.8 mg/mL ; Group 3 : PCEA fentanyl 2 mcg/mL plus bupivacaine 0.625 mg/mL . Labor analgesia initiate group use fentanyl 15 mcg plus bupivacaine 2.5 mg administer intrathecally . A basal infusion rate PCEA set 8 mL/h patient administer bolus 8 mL every 10 minute one hour limit 32 mL . Breakthrough pain group manage use anesthesiologist administer bolus bupivacaine 1.25 mg/mL without fentanyl . The patient well individual evaluate study patient blind group assignment . Samples maternal venous blood Â½ teaspoon ( 2 ml ) cord blood 2ml ( 1/2 teaspoon ) collect delivery fetus . Blood concentration fentanyl bupivacaine ascertain use high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analysis . Success breastfeed use LATCH assessment tool measure lactation nurse within 24 hrs delivery . At 6 week 3 month postpartum , follow-up phone call anesthesia service make assess duration breastfeeding . Also , patient 's obstetrician contact obtain patient 's Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score ass postpartum depression , may variable decrease breastfeed success .</detailed_description>
