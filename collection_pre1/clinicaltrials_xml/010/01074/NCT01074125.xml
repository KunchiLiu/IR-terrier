	<brief_summary>This research study people high blood phosphorus level dialysis . This medical condition cause weaken bone damage organ . This lead many health problem , sometimes death . Phosphorus much food eat , helpful u small amount . Patients kidney failure trouble get rid phosphorus eat food . Dialysis help remove phosphorus , often patient must take phosphate binder like PhosLo® , Renagel® , Renvela® bring blood phosphorus level back normal . The purpose study see KRX-0502 ( ferric citrate ) safe effective phosphate binder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There screen visit 4 week receive study drug . Upon qualify study screen visit , patient ask stop take current phosphate binder 2 week . Then , patient continue qualify study , enter study last 28 day . Study visit happen every week patient 's usual dialysis appointment .
