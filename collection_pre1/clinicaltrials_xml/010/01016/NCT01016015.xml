	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Cixutumumab Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Metastatic , Recurrent Soft Tissue Sarcoma Bone Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient progression-free 12 week ( progression free survival [ PFS ] , define Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) ( A ) Insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1receptor ( R ) + soft tissue sarcoma ; ( B ) IGF-1R+ bone tumor ; ( C ) IGF-1R ( - ) sarcoma , treat weekly intravenous A12 ( cixutumumab ) temsirolimus . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( define CR + PR ) . II . To determine overall survival . III . To determine correlation clinical outcome pre- post-treatment IGF-1R pathway related marker plasma ( pre post therapy ) , archive tissue , pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 4 week .</detailed_description>
