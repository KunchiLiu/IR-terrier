	<brief_title>Acute Asthma Responsiveness B2 Adrenergic Receptors Polymorphisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recently available statistic indicate approximately 22.2 million people United States asthma . Of , 55 % experience least one attack year survey result 1.9 million visit emergency department 497,000 hospitalization . The natural history acute asthma one resolution 70 80 % people rapidly clear airway obstruction follow treatment 7.5 10.0 mg nebulized albuterol . However , subset patient recurrent severe episodes poorly responsive treatment require admission hospital resolution . Although patient represent minority asthmatic , persistent disease account vast majority expenditures urgent care . Yet virtually nothing know . In present application , wish test hypothesis individual poorly albuterol genetic polymorphism beta 2 adrenergic receptor ( β2AR ) either influence severity and/or reduce responsiveness short act bronchodilator . One possibility great clinical significance albuterol non-responders genetically determine difference β2AR regulate effectiveness . Various polymorphism describe receptor great attention devote single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) substitution amino acid position 16 ( arginine glycine , Arg 16 Gly ) 27 ( glutamine glutamic acid , Gln 27 Glu ) . The Gly 16 receptor exhibit enhance regulation vitro exposure agonist Arg 16 allele resistant . The Gly 16 allele strongly associate asthma destabilization manifest nocturnal symptom increase risk severity . In contrast , Arg/Arg homozygosity position 16 associated poor outcome prospective study regular use short-acting β2 agonist . This phenomenon see asthmatic use albuterol need basis homozygous glycine . Since 90 % subject study , others , acute asthma take drug routinely vast majority treat emergently , presence Arg/Arg allele could lead poor response . It also suggest polymorphism may also produce similar effect long-acting β2 agonist . Again , since large percentage asthmatic patient chronically use long acting sympathomimetics , factor may contributory effect . Alternatively , β2AR pharmacogenetics may totally unimportant . Two study imply neither single genotype Codon 16 , haplotype β2AR effect acute bronchodilator response either albuterol salbutamol . However , since trial perform stable patient , may representative non-responsive group describe . In current study propose build upon previous method use care acute asthma . Clinical assessment treatment regimens standardize use care path previous study . Demographics , height , weight , race , symptom , sign , past medical history , routine medication use previous month prior index visit record intake sheet . We routinely obtain information disease duration , frequency attack , hospitalization , ICU admission , intubation , list general specific trigger acute exacerbation . We also record asthma medication include oral inhaled steroid , short long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist , antileukotriene drug , anticholinergic methylxanthines . We include history concurrent medication include eye drop ( beta-blockers prostaglandin ) , cardiac anti-hypertensive drug , ( beta-adrenergic active agent ACE inhibitor . We ask people take asthma drug , way know truly use prescribe . If medication obtain hospital may possible determine many prescription fill , still know use . We also record use illicit drug cocaine , heroine , OxyContin , etc . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight Kg divide height meter square . Obesity classify BMI ≥ 30 Kg/M2 . Arterial oxygen saturation determine pulse oximetry room air supplemental oxygen administer necessary value less 90 % . Before treatment , best three peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) take represent patient 's initial state flow limitation . The PEFR data record absolute term well percentage predict normal . As previous study , patient 's airway obstruction prevent achieve minimum level peak flow meter , value 10 arbitrarily assign avoid divide zero percentage improvement follow albuterol calculate . The subject receive either 2.5 mg nebulized albuterol every 20 min three dos two dos 5.0 mg albuterol 20 min apart . Albuterol non-responsiveness defined failure PEFR acutely ill asthmatic exceed 40 % predict follow ≥7.5 mg albuterol ( 2.5 mg albuterol aerosols q.20 min x3 ) . After completion schedule , PEFR repeat patient reexamine . Admission discharge decision make accord publish predetermined criterion . Patients consider ready send home asymptomatic , free accessory muscle use , absent diminish wheezing , achieve peak flow 60 % predict . Those meeting requirement give treatment adrenergic anticholinergic bronchodilator glucocorticoid discretion ED physician reassess hourly . If subsequently meet discharge criterion , release . If , admit hospital . The false-positive admission rate algorithm find less 1 % 24-hour relapse rate le 2 % . Only individual index ED visit treatment acute asthma attack study . Patients history suggestive congestive heart failure , pneumonia , chronic bronchitis , emphysema exclude . Venous blood drawn 1250 subject . It expect 25 % obstruction poorly responsive albuterol require admission hospital resolution . The 75 % obstruction quickly resolve albuterol discharged home . The DNA isolate assayed blindly Center Human Genetics Research , Vanderbilt Medical Center identification β2 AR SNPs position 16 27 receptor haplotype . Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyped use TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) . Eleven polymorphisms select genotyping within ADRB2 cod region 5 kb 5 ' Codon 1 ( rs11958940 , rs17778257 , rs2895795 , rs2053044 , rs12654778 , rs11959427 , rs1042711 , rs1042713 , rs1042714 , rs1800888 , rs1042718 ) . Quality-control measure include genotype call rate 95 % significant departures Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium within racial group ( exact p value &gt; 0.01 ) . Haplotypes predict publicly available software ( SNPHNP-a program estimating frequency large haplotype single-nucleotide polymorphism [ version 1.3 ] ) . Haplotype pair 2/2 , 2/4 , 2/6 , 4/4 , 4/6 6/6 evaluate . The primary outcome variable genetic pattern ( SNPs haplotype ) population . We wish evaluate SNP pattern albuterol responsiveness use case control study . Between-group comparison make analysis covariance . The association baseline PEFR percent improvement follow albuterol stratify SNP pattern assess analysis covariance . Single polymorphism may insufficient suggest haplotype contain multiple polymorphism may informative . Drysdale coworkers identify 13 polymorphism organize 12 haplotype group vary frequency ethnic group . The four common haplotype 1 , 2 , 4 6 . Haplotype 2 , contain Gly16 homozygote , associate great FEV1 , reversibility haplotype 4 , contain Arg16 homozygote , least . Five haplotype pair common asthmatic . Homozygotes , haplotypes 2/2 great impact FEV1 protein expression haplotype pair 4/4 show least effect category . Since isolated SNP may predictive utility , measure haplotype . The haplotype combination 4/4 produce small impact may operational non-responders . The haplotype pair 4/6 produce large improvement albuterol , , therefore , may operational responsive group . We estimate haplotype frequency across pool study patient . Using logistic regression , calculate global score statistic rest overall association haplotype responsiveness albuterol . Next , haplotype specific score correspond p-values calculate . Similar statistic calculate adjust baseline covariates . These analysis carry use R function haplo.stats . We evaluate association haplotype 1-6 response/non-response adrenergic agonist use case-control study . Using data Table 1 assume case make 25 % study subject , use function haplo.power.cc . We require sample size 1243 patient able detect least 40 % increase risk non-responsive adrenergic agonist patient haplotype contain Arg16Arg compare haplotype without Arg16Arg 80 % power 0.05 level significance . Under similar assumption , require total sample size 865 able detect 50 % increase risk treatment failure patient haplotypes contain Arg16Arg compare patient without . The number subject represent total required achieve sufficient power give 75:25 treatment success-failure ratio . The result study demonstrate whether Gly16Arg Gln27Glu genotypes and/or β2AR haplotype associate response albuterol patient experience acute episode asthma whether genotype pattern varies different clinical phenotype . They also provide insight whether polymorphisms determine severity episode measure initial pulmonary function symptom . In investigation , positive negative result would extremely important . Positive finding would suggest begin make sense therapeutic responsiveness basic level . They also suggest need begin search alternative treatment significant segment asthmatic population become acutely ill . Equally important mean effort asthma control need longer diffusely apply , focus prophylaxis affected individual . Negative finding conclusively demonstrate genetically determine change B2AR readily translate clinical response need look factor determine severity resource utilization beta2 unresponsive population .</detailed_description>
