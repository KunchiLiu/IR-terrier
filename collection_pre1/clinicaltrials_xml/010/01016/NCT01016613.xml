	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) affect approximately 26 million Americans disproportionately manifest specific race ethnic group . Patients burden CKD significant morbidity reduce life expectancy . In addition excessive suffering lose productivity , cost manage epidemic reach $ 40 billion annually . The recognition CKD major public health problem reflect fourteen objective outline Healthy People 2020 begin address disease burden . Advancement approach halt CKD progression slow despite grow global awareness disease burden . This O'Brien Kidney Research Core create opportunity novel insight characterization tissue profile define new disease marker molecular pathway available kidney investigator www . It thereby fundamentally alter start point research prevention progression kidney disease . C-PROBE essential element center grant present biomedical resource core consisting : ( 1 ) clinical phenotyping ( , systematic identification observable physical biomedical characteristic ) kidney disease patient include accurate measurement kidney function ; ( 2 ) specimen BioBank store blood , urine kidney tissue sample . A key component C-PROBE therefore contains prove mechanism collect sample high risk group include minority , institution University Michigan Health System , St. John Hospital , Wayne State University Michigan , John H. Stroger Hospital Illinois , Temple University Health System Pennsylvania , Levine Children 's Hospital North Carolina . This mechanism feed Cores provide biomedical investigator approve project access dynamic pool well characterize high risk kidney disease patient biological specimen conduct high caliber translational research .</brief_summary>
