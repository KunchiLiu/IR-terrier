	<brief_summary>Rationale : Computer system allow doctor create 3 dimensional ( 3-D ) picture tumor may help plan radiation therapy may result tumor cell kill . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs , cisplatin , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Radiation Therapy Cisplatin Patients With Stage I , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : This clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging-based radiation therapy cisplatin treat patient stage I , stage II , stage III , stage IV cervical cancer.Detailed DescriptionPRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility use MRI base treatment plan intracavitary brachytherapy treatment planning . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate incidence early toxicity , specifically genitourinary gastrointestinal . II . To evaluate incidence late toxicity , specifically genitourinary gastrointestinal . III . To evaluate local , regional , distant recurrence rate . IV . To evaluate disease-free overall survival rate . OUTLINE : Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy ( 3-dimensional conformal OR intensity-modulated ) 4-6 insertion MRI-guided intracavitary brachytherapy 8 week . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 30-60 minute 5-6 week radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
