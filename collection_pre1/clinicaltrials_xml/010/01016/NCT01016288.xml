	<brief_title>Controlled Trial Comparing Performance 22 Gauge Versus 25 Gauge EUS-FNA Needles ( FNA-22G-25G )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue acquisition Endoscopic ultrasound play central role diagnosis several pathology ; achieve obtain cytological material fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) needle able provide smear malignant cell . Several needle present available include 19 Gauge , 22 Gauge 25 Gauge needle . A 22 Gauge needle present standard needle EUS-FNA result base FNA needle . Twenty five Gauge needle presently available market distinctly small , highly flexible may easier penetrate hard pancreatic tumor . There even anecdotal message size needle may able traverse relatively large vascular structure without major risk . However , scant data whether 25 G needle comparable standard 22 G needle term specimen cellularity quality . There one small randomize trial publish abstract Lee et al report statistical significant difference cellularity two group needle size judge 2 different cytologist . However , conclusion dubious considerable bias may present since needle use lesion . There therefore need properly design randomize study compare different needle size . This study prospective randomize multicenter study . Patients refer one participate department EUS examination include prospectively . Linear EUS examination do linear echoendoscope lymph node , mediastinal , pancreatic intra-abdominal mass . Tumor lymph node characteristic carefully describe : size ( long axis ) , echogeneity ( hypoechoic , hyperechoic , mixed ) , echostructure ( homogenous , in-homogenous , calcification ) , shape ( round , oval , triangular ) , border ( regular , irregular ) . EUS-guided cell sample perform 22 G ( Medi-Globe , Sonotip II ) 25 G ( Medi-Globe , Sonotip II ) needle EUS Colour-Doppler guidance . Needle order select randomly , one single needle pr . Lesion . Three pass perform either needles randomization , use 6 uniform fro movement every pas continuous 10cc suction reason standardization . The material expel separate numbered glass slide . The cytopathologist review material stain blind needle size use standardize criterion evaluation cellularity . Doubtless , multicenter randomize controlled trial comparison , experimental method , need necessity serious statistical evaluation , bring benefit improve reliability credibility finding thus obtain . Accordingly , exploratory data analysis statistical inference perform . Technically , expect number lesion include study 220 , 110 group . Block randomization ( block size = 4 ) use ensure exactly equal treatment number certain equally spaced point sequence patient assignment ( Knuth shuffle algorithm random permutation ) . For diagnostic test sensitivity , specificity positive negative predictive value diagnostic accuracy calculate calculated separately EUS-FNA 1st pas , 2nd pas 3rd pas compare result final diagnosis . All result express mean , standard deviation ( SD ) confidence interval . Testing hypothesis use afterwards . An priori power analysis perform determine appropriate sample size order achieve adequate power statistical test subsequently use . The data group compare standard comparison test chi-square test Fishers exact test appropriate . The level statistical significance state 0.05 .</detailed_description>
