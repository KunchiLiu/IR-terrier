	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory AIDS-Related Kaposi Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) single agent bortezomib subject AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate clinical response KS tumor bortezomib . II . Evaluate impact bortezomib human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) plasma viral load peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) apolipoprotein B messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) edit enzyme , catalytic polypeptide-like 3G ( APOBEC3G ) level . III . Determine impact bortezomib Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) . IV . Assess bortezomib effect KSHV copy number PBMC plasma whether change viral copy number measure PBMC plasma associate clinical response KS tumor . V. Monitor KSHV gene expression KS biopsy specimen PBMC pre- post-bortezomib ass whether change viral gene expression ( i.e. , lytic pattern ) tumor biopsy associate clinical response . VI . Assess whether change viral copy number PBMC plasma occur concert independently change viral antigen expression tumor biopsy specimen . VII . Assess effect bortezomib protein relevant KS tumor survival proliferation ( i.e. , P53 , von Hippel-Lindau [ VHL ] , p27 , hypoxia-inducible factor 1 [ HIF1 ] -alpha ) well level nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) gene target mRNAs tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
