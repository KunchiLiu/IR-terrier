	<brief_title>Azacitidine Lenalidomide Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary : Phase 1 : To determine toxicity feasibility combine lenalidomide azacitidine patient relapsed/ refractory AML ≥ 18 year untreated AML ≥60 year . Phase 2 : To assess complete remission ( CRm plus CRi ) rate lenalidomide + azacitidine therapy untreated AML ≥60 year . Secondary : 1 . To assess response rate ( RR ) , morphologic leukemia-free state , morphologic complete remission rate ( CRm ) , cytogenetic CR ( CRc ) rate , CR incomplete blood count 14 rate , partial remission 15 rate ( PR ) . 2 . To assess overall survival ( OS ) event free survival ( EFS ) . 3 . To assess time progression ( TTP ) untreated AML ≥60 year . 4 . To assess relapse free survival ( RFS ) duration CR complete responder . 5 . To determine incidence severity toxicity lenalidomide combination azacitidine . 6 . Assay expression level cytokines/chemokines bone marrow plasma , expression chemokine receptors/ligands leukemic blast important AML microenvironment study direct cytotoxic effect lenalidomide , azacitidine combination drug cryopreserved AML blast cell .</detailed_description>

Patients must abnormalities inversion 16 , ( 16,16 ) , del ( 16q ) , ( 8,21 ) ( 15,17 ) assess routine cytogenetics FISH . Diagnosis AML WHO criteria ( &gt; 20 % blast ) determine CBC , bone marrow assessment , immunophenotypic analysis perform within 2 week study enrollment . No previous treatment AML , however hydroxyurea , steroid , leukopheresis allow . Relapsed AML age ≥18 year , except acute promyelocytic leukemia ( AML M3 ) , CR &lt; 1 year post 1st induction chemotherapy include phase 1 study . Primary refractory AML age ≥18 year , except acute promyelocytic leukemia ( AML M3 ) post 1st induction chemotherapy include phase 1 study .
