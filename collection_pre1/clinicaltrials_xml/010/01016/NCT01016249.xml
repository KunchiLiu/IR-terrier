	<brief_title>Nebulized 5 % Hypertonic Saline Treatment Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct double blind , randomize , parallel-group clinical trial compare efficacy safety hypertonic saline 3 % 5 % versus normal saline treatment acute bronchiolitis . The study conduct short stay unit Pediatric Emergency Center Hamad General Hospital , pediatric emergency facility State Qatar . The Center serve average 200,000 patient annually manage 42 bed short stay unit . Patients admit unit assess least every 6 hour pediatrician determine readiness discharge . The length stay unit bronchiolitis range 6 168 hour . Infants age ≤18 month present unit treatment moderate-severe viral bronchiolitis eligible study . Moderate-severe bronchiolitis require prodromal history consistent viral upper respiratory tract infection follow wheeze and/or crackle auscultation Wang bronchiolitis severity score ≥ 4 presentation . Patients exclude study one follow characteristic : Born preterm ≤34 week gestation , previous history wheezing , steroid use within 48 hour presentation , obtundation progressive respiratory failure require ICU admission , history apnea 24 hour presentation , oxygen saturation ≤ 85 % room air time recruitment , history diagnosis chronic lung disease , congenital heart disease , immunodeficiency . The six attend physician cover 18 bed respiratory section short stay unit train score practical application bronchiolitis patient unit study begin . Written informed consent , seek one parent legal guardian eligible patient soon patient admit unit . The study approve hospital institutional review board . Patients examine presentation require treatment observation admit short stay unit . Those bronchiolitis assess study eligibility within 2 hour initial physician assessment . Patients consent obtain underwent plain chest radiography nasopharyngeal swab take RSV detection ( RSV Respi-Strip , Coris Bioconcept , Gembloux , Belgium ) . Then computer-generated list random number use enrol physician consecutive order identify seal envelope contain one three code identify one three different bag 500 mL sterilely-prepared blind study solution , make fresh morning pharmacist blind patient assignment.Patients receive study nebulization mix 1.5 ml epinephrine double blinded fashion enrollment every 4 hour thereafter ready discharge.Additional nebulized epinephrine 5ml delivered way administer blind study solution maximum frequency every hour additional treatment ( e.g. , supplementary oxygen , hydration ) give discretion treat physician . Patients withdraw study oxygen saturation within 30 min nebulization fell 85 % room air clinical deterioration determine warrant transfer pediatric intensive care unit . Patients discharge treat physician determine patient need supplementary oxygen , feed adequately without intravenous fluid , minimal absent wheezing , crackle , chest retraction provide he/she oxygen saturation ≥ 94 % severity score &lt; 4 discharge . At discharge , patient send home albuterol metered-dose inhaler . Follow-up study nurse telephone mandatory daily , one week discharge . The patient could return pediatric emergency center earlier desire need .</detailed_description>
