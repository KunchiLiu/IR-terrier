	<brief_title>Tibial Delayed Healing Pivotal Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate INFUSE/MASTERGRAFT™ Delayed Healing Device alternative/replacement autograft treatment tibial delay healing . A subject consider tibial delayed heal he/she least six month date recent surgical intervention show sign radiographic heal least three month . Radiographic sign heal study define either progressive disappearance fracture line development cortical continuity [ bridge bone ] site . All prospective patient must require surgical treatment rigid internal fixation [ ream IM nail plate/screws ] bone grafting .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Has tibial delay healing . A subject consider delayed heal he/she least six month date recent surgical intervention show sign radiographic heal least three month . ( Radiographic sign heal study define either progressive disappearance fracture line development cortical continuity [ bridge bone ] site . ) 2 . Has delay heal tibia require treatment rigid internal fixation bone grafting . ( Stable rigid internal fixation hardware may already place prior treatment . If require , fixation hardware may remove replace along placement bone graft . ) 3 . Has adequate soft tissue coverage delay heal site . All prior soft tissue coverage procedure ( e.g. , skin graft flap ) sufficiently heal placement bone graft prior enrollment study . 4 . Has sufficient amount iliac crest autograft available bone graft procedure . 5 . After walk 5 6 step , intensity pain/discomfort injury site equal great 4 ( report preoperative Delayed Healing Site Pain Questionnaire form ; 0 pain 10 pain bad could ) . 6 . Is least 21 year age skeletally mature time surgery . 7 . If female childbearing potential , patient pregnant nursing agree become pregnant one year follow surgery study . 8 . Is willing able comply study plan able understand sign Patient Informed Consent Form . 1 . Has congenital pseudarthrosis pathological fracture nonunion ( include osteoporosisrelated fracture ) . 2 . Has tibial delay heal articular involvement ( e.g. , intraarticular ) . ( The original fracture may involve joint , result delay heal site may involve joint . ) 3 . Has hypertrophic tibial delay healing ( e.g. , observed xray abundant callus `` horse hoof '' appearance ) . 4 . Has inadequate neurovascular status involve limb may jeopardize heal . 5 . Has active know prior infection delay heal site ( e.g. , presence purulent drainage site , prior positive culture site , evidence active/prior osteomyelitis site ) . Enrolled subject whose intraoperative culture test positive bacteria may remain study . 6 . Has exist stable hardware remove meet algorithm requirement . 7 . Has treatment plan delay heal NOT include placement bone graft and/or rigid internal fixation consist ream intramedullary nail plate/screws . 8 . Has tibial delay heal injury site bony defect large 4 cm length . 9 . Has another injury/condition prevent ambulation completion study assessment . 10 . Has history endocrine metabolic disorder know affect osteogenesis ( e.g. , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , hyperthyroidism , parathyroid hormone disorder , EhlerDanlos syndrome , osteogenesis imperfecta , calcium imbalance ) . 11 . Has Vitamin D deficiency , define 25hydroxy Vitamin D serum concentration ≤11ng/mL . 12 . Has active malignancy prior history malignancy ( except basal cell carcinoma skin ) . 13 . Has overt active systemic infection ( e.g. , HIV/AIDS , hepatitis , bacteremia ) . 14 . Has oral injectable steroid six week time enrollment . This include episodic steroid use ; inhaled steroid ; steroid medication ( e.g. , Epidural Steroid Injections , Medrol DosePaks ) specifically perioperative management symptom . 15 . Has condition require postoperative medication could interfere bone heal implant , steroid . This include low dose aspirin prophylactic anticoagulation ; routine perioperative antiinflammatory drug ; episodic steroid use ; inhaled steroid . 16 . Has history certain autoimmune disease . ( Refer List Autoimmune Diseases CIP information . ) 17 . Has history exposure injectable collagen silicone implant . 18 . Has previous exposure recombinant BMPs either human animal extraction . 19 . Has history hypersensitivity collagen protein pharmaceutical ( e.g. , monoclonal antibody gamma globulin ) . 20 . Has history allergy bovine collagen product . 21 . Has document allergy intolerance metal metal alloy , stainless steel titanium . 22 . Has chronic acute renal and/or hepatic failure prior history renal and/or hepatic parenchymal disease . 23 . Is mentally incompetent . If questionable , obtain psychiatric consult . 24 . Is prisoner . 25 . Is alcohol and/or drug abuser define currently undergo treatment alcohol and/or drug abuse . 26 . Has receive treatment investigational therapy ( drug , device , and/or biologic ) within 28 day prior implantation surgery treatment plan 12month period follow study surgery</criteria>
