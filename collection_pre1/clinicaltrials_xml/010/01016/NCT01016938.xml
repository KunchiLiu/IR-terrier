	<brief_summary>Radiation treatment patient cancer design base CT scan . We know tumor chest abdomen move breathe . Because , difference plan treatment treatment actually deliver body . Usually radiation safety margin add ensure radiation hit entire tumor . This damage healthy part body exact location tumor unknown . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) painless safe diagnostic procedure use powerful magnet radio wave produce detailed image body 's organs structure , without use X-rays radiation . The research doctor study see position tumor track use MRI scan track sensor place skin . MRI scan track system use calculate location position tumor FDA approve technology . The research doctor also use MRI scan evaluate change lung function follow radiation treatment . In study participant undergo series MRI scan without contrast dye . This study fund grant National Institutes Health ( NIH ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Lung Tumor Motion Lung Function ( GCC 0943 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In protocol , seek ass whether tumor motion infer use dynamic MRI external surrogate . We propose ( 1 ) investigate feasibility track real-time tumor position use dynamic MRI infer tumor position use external surrogate place skin subject ( 2 ) determine lung function follow radiation assess lung perfusion map obtain via dynamic MRI dose map order determine image-based biomarkers lung toxicity follow radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients 18 year old old Patients must undergo radiation therapy without chemotherapy thoracic and/or abdominal cancer . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude .
