	<brief_title>OSI-906 Irinotecan Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plan learn investigational drug call OSI-906 . OSI-906 look see could treatment advance cancer . Subjects also receive drug call irinotecan ( also call Camptosar® ) . This drug FDA approve treatment metastatic colon cancer type cancer . The study drug irinotecan never test together human . It unknown combination safe and/or effective treatment human cancer . The purpose study find answer follow research question : - What high dose study drug give subject combination irinotecan without cause side effect severe ? - How combination study drug irinotecan handle blood subject advance cancer ? Does either study drug irinotecan effect work ? - What common side effect study drug irinotecan give together subject advance cancer ? - Is combination study drug irinotecan effective stopping growth shrink size tumor ?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Dose Escalation Phase : Histological cytopathological diagnosis advance cancer refractory standard therapy standard therapy exist . Irinotecan must list Compendia reimbursement , ie . colorectal cancer ; lung cancer ; gastric ; esophageal , cervical ovarian cancer . Cohort Expansion Phase : Histological cytopathological diagnosis advance colorectal cancer know Kirsten rat sarcoma ( KRAS ) mutation status . All patient must receive progressed intolerable firstline therapy oxaliplatincontaining regimen . Patients must screen use OSI906 integrate classifier . Cohort 1 ( 12 patient ) : Window opportunity cohort : Patients score least 4 5 OSI906 integrate classifier irinotecannaive receive OSI906 single agent disease progression . Patients must non surgically resectable surgical candidate comorbid condition . At disease progression , patient best response least stable disease 3 cycle ( 9 week ) , irinotecan may add OSI906 . Cohort 2 : ( 16 patient : 8 KRAS wildtype ( WT ) 8 KRAS Mutant ( MT ) . Patients score less 4 OSI906 integrate classifier OSI906 add irinotecan disease progression irinotecan ( patient KRAS WT receive cetuximab irinotecan ) . Patients treat dose escalation phase recommend phase II dose combination meet criterion Cohort 2 expand phase may count towards dose expansion patient number . Age ≥18 year old Patients must Eastern Cooperative oncology group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Life expectancy least three month . Adequate hematological function bone marrow reserve : Hematopoetic : Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ( 1,500/mm3 ) , Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L , Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL Adequate hepatic renal function Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 fold upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 fold ULN calculate creatinine clearance , use CockcroftGault formula &gt; 60 mL/min , 60 mL/min Glomerular Filtration Rate &gt; 60 mL/min determine 24 hour urine collection Measurable ( accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Criteria dose expansion cohort measurable /evaluable disease Dose Escalation phase , Ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent comply study protocol procedure . A : Documentation KRAS status must perform prior enrollment . Concurrent symptomatic central nervous system involvement , brain meningeal metastasis Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , unstable cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrollable hypertension psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Documented history diabetes Corrected QT ( QTc ) interval &gt; 450 msec baseline Drugs Risk Causing correct QT interval Prolongation : Drugs risk cause QT interval prolongation prohibit within 14 day prior Day 1 dose study avoid exacerbation OSI906 potential side effect Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease ) , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption Gastrointestinal tract disease ( include peptic ulcer disease ) prior surgery result inability take oral medication Patients may prior therapy , provide follow condition meet : Chemotherapy : A minimum 3 week ( 4 week carboplatin investigational anticancer agent 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) must elapse end treatment start treatment . Patients must recover treatmentrelated toxicity ( except alopecia , fatigue , grade 1 neurotoxicity ) prior start treatment . Hormonal therapy : Patients may prior anticancer hormonal therapy provide discontinue prior start treatment . However , patient prostate cancer evidence progressive disease may continue therapy produce medical castration ( eg , goserelin leuprorelin ) , provide therapy commence least 3 month earlier . Radiation : Patients may prior radiation therapy provide recovered acute , toxic effect radiotherapy prior start treatment . A minimum 21 day must elapse end radiotherapy start treatment radiation affect 25 % bone marrow otherwise 14 day wash require . Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide wound healing occur prior start treatment . • Laboratory result : international normalized ratio ( INR ) ≥ 1.5 X ULN activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≥ 1.5 X ULN Fasting blood glucose &gt; 125mg/dL baseline Day 1 dosing . Women pregnant breast feeding teratogenic potential . Women childbearing potential pregnancy exclude use adequate method contraception teratogenic potential .
