	<brief_summary>The investigator ' primary objective identify common rare mutation filaggrin gene African American patient diagnosis atopic dermatitis ichthyosis vulgaris . Atopic dermatitis , eczema , common , chronic , relapse remit problem many child affect 10-20 % pediatric population . Itch predominant feature disease quite disruptive daily activity life . In addition itch , characterize markedly dry skin , small red bump may fluid . Ichthyosis vulgaris characterize extremely dry , scaly skin fine white scale increase amount line note palm . Filaggrin protein essential skin function properly barrier found mutate European patient ichthyosis vulgaris atopic dermatitis . This association look African American population . Genomic DNA ( gDNA ) purify buccal swab use commercially available kit analyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic screen molecular dermatology allow physician scientist screen population manifest specific genetic disorder skin , hair nail study animal model experiment-induced dermatopathology , disease , treatment . The purpose screening identify gene ( ) involve elicit phenotypic characteristic clinician identify diagnosis treatment say disease ( ) . The field genetics dermatology progress immensely last 20 year strongly influence practice dermatology . Most known single gene disorder , epidermoloysis bullosa , map particular chromosomal region many case , causative gene identify . However , common diseases polygenic origin atopic dermatitis remain challenge decipher . In addition , still remain several monogenic disorder underlie genetic basis unclear . In case , genetic analysis perform sequence entire gene gene region , screen specific common mutation . In Japanese European population , several researcher able find association people atopic dermatitis ichythosis vulgaris filaggrin gene . Atopic dermatitis , ezcema , common , chronic , relapse remit problem many child affect 10-20 % pediatric population . Atopic dermatitis often call itch rash , since itch predominant feature disease quite disruptive daily activity life . In addition itch , characterize markedly dry skin , small red bump may fluid . Though treatment available help rash resolve help itch , disease continue appear treatment stop often become infected . Ichythosis vulgaris quite prevalent , estimate 1 250 person affect . It characterize extremely dry , scaly skin fine white scale increase amount line note palm . Ichythosis vulgaris think happen due combination excess production one layer skin abnormal skin shed . Filaggrin protein essential skin function properly barrier . It initially think one gene responsible cause atopic dermatitis 2006 identify causal mutation ichthyosis vulgaris . This association extensively study European population lesser extent Japanese population ; however , look African American population These new insight may help lead future target therapy two extraordinarily common skin disorder . General clinical application method diagnosis may include histological tissue examination , laboratory-based specimen analysis , physical examination . However , although useful , method limit identification phenotypic expression genetic abnormality . Conversely , genetic screening tissue ( collect via buccal swab ) enable clinician scientist access finite method diagnosis , treatment , prevention option . Such method test particularly appeal use disorder exact basis disease unknown , case atopic dermatitis ichythosis vulgaris African American population . Thus , genetic screening field dermatology remain important research agenda focus proposal . This study allow collection genetic material patient see dermatology clinic Ann &amp; Robert H Lurie Children 's Hospital Chicago .</detailed_description>
