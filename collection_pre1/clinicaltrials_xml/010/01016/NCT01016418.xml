	<detailed_description>1 . HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES 1.1 . HYPOTHESIS Ingestion bovine colostrum powder ( BCP ) cow immunized insulin improve non alcoholic steatohepatitis metabolic syndrome patient suffer condition 1.2 . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES 1.2.1 To determine efficacy BCP improve liver enzyme level patient NASH . 1.2.2 To determine safety administration oral BCP patient NASH . 1.3 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1.3.1 . To determine whether administration BCP improve metabolic syndrome patient NASH ( namely insulin resistance ) . 2 . INTRODUCTION 2.1 . BACKGROUND 2.1.1 . Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis . Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH common , often `` silent '' liver disease affect 2 % -5 % Americans4-6 . NASH strongly associate metabolic syndrome , diabetes type-2 obesity lead cirrhosis , HCC , liver transplantation death . The mean proving diagnosis NASH separate simple fatty liver liver biopsy ( invasive procedure carry certain degree risk ) . Currently , effective treatment NASH7 . 2.1.2 . The effect Hyperimmune Bovine Colostrum NASH Regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) recognize important immunomodulatory component adaptive immune system . Immune dysregulation may lead chronic inflammation , trigger chronic insulin insensitivity non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . The role Tregs adipose tissue regulation NASH previously study . Aim : To assess effect Tregs stimulation hepatic injury insulin resistance NASH . Methods : Leptin deficient Ob/Ob mouse feed 4 week colostrum derive solution ( CDS ) enrich anti insulin specific antibody ( AIS-CDS , Immuron , Australia ) , purify anti insulin specific CDS ( PAIS-CDS ) . The immunologic effect adipose tissue determine flow cytometry perform central adipose tissue stromal vasculature ( SV ) , compare effect immune system liver spleen . Hepatic injury insulin resistance determine glucose tolerance test ( GTT ) liver enzymes . Results : Oral administration anti-insulin antibody promote SV CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cell ( 13.05 vs. 27.94 p=0.01 ) . Treatment associate decrease CD4+IL17+ lymphocyte subset adipose tissue ( 87.89 vs. 12.93 , p &lt; 0.01 ) , SV ( 61.86 vs. 14.99 , p &lt; 0.01 ) , liver ( 40.18 vs. 2.66 , p &lt; 0.01 ) . The liver CD8+CD25+FoxP3+ lymphocyte subset significantly increase ( 0.36 vs. 2.39 , p &lt; 0.05 ) . The CD4/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio adipose tissue show mirror effect spleen liver suggest opposite effect lymphocyte trapping . Promotion Tregs adipose tissue accompany marked improvement insulin resistance manifest decrease glucose insulin serum level , improve glucose tolerance test result ( decrease 45 % , area curve 23355 vs. 42448 , treat vs. control , respectively ) , along decrease liver enzyme ( ALT level decrease 743.4 379.8 IU , p &lt; 0.05 ; AST 770.5 299IU , control vs. , treat respectively , p=0.07 ) without change body weight . Conclusions : The immune system adipose tissue play important role regulation metabolic syndrome . Decreasing TH17 liver , adipose tissue SV , along promotion CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ CD8+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs ( SC liver respectively ) , oral administration anti insulin CDS offer new treatment modality NASH insulin resistance , make Tregs adipose tissue new therapeutic target alleviation liver damage NASH . 2.1.3 . BCP Has Been Shown Be Safe Well-tolerated Humans Over 80,000 packet Anadis tabletted BCP product active component sell Australia 4 year . There reported adverse event report Anadis . BioGard high dose separate product approve 2008 . Risk microbiological contamination : The colostrum product pasteurize ; strict procedure minimize risk contamination , tablet batch test yeast , mold , coliform bacteria , Enterobacteriaceae , staphylococci , Salmonella , Listeria . The cow colostrum production source bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) -free country . Additionally , milk product consider detectable infectivity consider unlikely present risk source healthy animal condition milk collect human consumption . Lactose intolerance : Bovine colostrum extract generally contain &lt; 10 % lactose , compare 50 % normal skim milk powder ; therefore , lactose intolerance unlikely major safety problem . Clinical sign expect susceptible human give 5-10g lactose ( Thorn et al , 1977 ) . At dose bovine colostrum extract 10g day ( 2.8g dose propose study ) , maximum 1 g would lactose . Side effect . No case death ever report study BCP . While typical dose 10g/day [ 8-10 ] dos high 10 g four time daily study [ 11 ] . Adverse reaction number slight severity . In clinical study efficacy bovine colostrum demonstrable adverse effect [ 9 , 10 , 12-15 ] . When occur , mostly consist nausea , emesis , flatulence , mild diarrhea [ 8 , 11 , 14 , 16 , 17 ] . In one study , transient moderate elevation serum level hepatic transaminase observe volunteer receive bovine immunoglobulin concentrate prepare E. coli ( 5/10 ) rotavirus ( 2/10 ) . This effect attribute diet high protein provide hospital ( 13 ) . More recently , bovine colostrum well-tolerated HIV-infected person treatment HIV-associated diarrhea ( 18 ) . Colostrum administration avoid person allergic cow 's milk . 3 . STUDY DESIGN This single-arm , open label , before-and-after exploratory trial evaluate effect 4 week BCP administration serum liver enzymes metabolic syndrome patient NASH . Candidates identify among patient treat department medicine liver unit Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center ask sign approve informed consent study activity initiate . Participants follow study weekly visit well additional 4 week conclude treatment ass safety . 4 . SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF SUBJECTS 4.1 . INCLUSION CRITERIA 4.1.1 . Biopsy proven NASH ( NAS score ≥ 4 ) 4.1.2 . Serum ALT level ≥ 30 ( U/L ) 4.1.3 . Age 18-65 4.1.4 . Treatment diabetes 2 oral medication , stable dos 2 month . 4.1.5 .
