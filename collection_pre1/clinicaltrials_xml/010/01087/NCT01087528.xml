	<brief_title>Evaluation PillCam™ Colon 2 Visualization Colon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard evaluation subject suspect colon disease include endoscopic image colonoscopy radiology test : air-contrast barium enema , abdominal/pelvic CT , virtual colonoscopy . The Given® Diagnostic System offer alternative approach endoscopic visualization colon . Advantages Given® Diagnostic System include elimination need conscious sedation , minimally invasive , painless nature exam , ability pursue normal daily activity immediately follow procedure . Furthermore , compare standard colonoscopy , Given® Diagnostic System may readily accept subject , thereby improve subject ' willingness undergo diagnostic evaluation colon comply colorectal cancer screen recommendation . The PillCam™ SB capsule ( formerly M2A® Capsule ) clear FDA- August 2001 small bowel evaluation ingest date 1,000,000 people worldwide well accepted patient physician well professional society . However , adequate visualization colon achieve standard PillCam™ SB capsule anatomical physiological property colon significantly different small bowel . Moreover , issue limit evaluation colonic mucosa standard PillCam™ SB procedure include unsatisfactory level colon cleanliness slow progression PillCam™ SB capsule colon desire examination time . Therefore , development introduction specially design , customize colon capsule combine dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol allow efficient evaluation colonic mucosa . This expect improve capability Given® Diagnostic System detect colonic pathology serve diagnostic screening tool colonic disease . To date , several clinical study conduct Given® Diagnostic System PillCam™ Colon 1 capsule A pilot multicenter study currently conduct new Given® Diagnostic System advance generation PillCam™ Colon capsule - PillCam™ Colon 2 . Capsule . The new development Given® Diagnostic System PillCam™ Colon 2 capsule primarily aim increase sensitivity specificity polyp detection . Further detail Given® Diagnostic System PillCam™ Colon 2 capsule find device description section . This study design evaluate performance new version Given® Diagnostic System PillCam™ Colon 2 capsule detect patient polyps colonic lesion compare conventional colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
