	<brief_summary>Background : - Previous study show people certain type brain damage may particular problem pay attention processing thing see . Researchers interested compare people brain damage without brain damage process visual image . Objectives : - To good understand area brain involve pay attention thing see . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age either damage one side specific part brain ( e.g. , stroke , injury , certain neurosurgery procedure ) healthy volunteer . Design : - The study involve 4 10 visit NIH Clinical Center 1 2 year . Each visit last approximately 2 hour . - Participants screen medical history physical examination , may cognitive test described visit . - On first visit least one visit thereafter , participant cognitive test evaluate think memory . These test either write test computer-based test . - Some participant qualify functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) part study . This part involve decision-making task perform computer fMRI scan . Additional scan may require direct study doctor . - Some randomly select participant ask magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , procedure record small magnetic field change produce brain activity . - During behavioral training , fMRI MEG scanning , participant may monitor equipment track eye movement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Top-Down Attentional Control Visual-Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention require , , perceptual process . There converge body evidence single-cell recording study monkey neuroimaging , behavioral , clinical study human show processing attended information enhance relative processing unattended information . What source attentional modulation ? Because neuroimaging study demonstrate multiple cortical region recruit task involve selective attention , proven difficult thus far determine differential contribution region . A central goal propose research characterize contribution prefrontal cortex parietal cortex test hypothesis region exert top-down modulatory influence visual processing area . Specifically , wish investigate interaction area involve attentional control visual area modulate attention . We propose study patient focal lesion healthy volunteer perform task require attention . Subjects participate , first , series behavioral study involve selective attention ; relative performance different patient group neurologically healthy volunteer compare . Subjects also study perform similar task functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . We hypothesize selective attention heavily impaired lesion key prefrontal ( e.g. , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) key parietal ( e.g. , superior parietal lobule ) sit . We also expect brain imaging data show decreased activation visual region ipsilateral focal lesion prefrontal parietal cortex , thus provide evidence prefrontal parietal cortex source top-down modulation . Although research group compare behavior patient various focal lesion perform fMRI study visual attention neurologically normal patient , unaware concerted effort perform fMRI patient focal lesion order functionally isolate contribution individual cortical region serve critical node attentional network .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . All subject 18 year age old least high school education . 2 . Capacity provide informed consent , understand cooperate study procedure . Patients : 1 . Unilateral bilateral focal lesion prefrontal , parietal , temporal cortex , amygdala . 2 . At least three month poststroke , lobectomy neurosurgical resection . Healthy volunteer : 1 . Neurologically normal good general health . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients : 1 . Any neurological psychiatric disorder relate focal lesion ( e.g. , epilepsy , schizophrenia , etc. ) . Epilepsy patient undergone surgery result seizure free may recruit . 2 . Previous head injury . 3 . Present past ( within past 6 month ) drug alcohol abuse addiction determine qualified study neurologist/psychiatrist . 4 . Radiation treatment brain threemonth period prior experiment . 5 . NIMH staff immediate family exclude participation . Healthy Volunteers : 1 . Any neurological psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , epilepsy , schizophrenia , etc . ) 2 . Previous head injury . 3 . Present past ( within past 6 month ) drug alcohol abuse addiction base DSM5 criterion determine History Physical exam . 4 . NIMH staff immediate family exclude participation . ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MRI SCAN : Patients Healthy volunteer : 1 . Women pregnant woman childbearing potential refuse undergo urine pregnancy test exclude fMRI experiment include cognitive experiment . 2 . Subjects contraindication MRI scan exclude FMRI experiment include cognitive experiment . These contraindication include : 1. central nervous system aneurysm clip ; 2. implanted neural stimulator ; 3. implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator ; 4. cochlear implant ; 5. ocular foreign body ( e.g. , metal shaving ) ; 6. insulin pump ; 7. metal shrapnel bullet ; 8. implanted device incompatible MRI . 3 . Conditions preclude scan , e.g. , morbid obesity , claustrophobia .</criteria>
