	<brief_title>The Effect Erythropietin Microcircualtory Alteration Intensive Care Unit Patients With Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis systemic inflammatory response bacterial infection common complication course treatment patient multiple trauma major surgery . In severe sepsis , inflammatory response lead multiple organ failure result death . Multiple organ dysfunction sepsis consider common cause death non-coronary critical care unit . In fact , sepsis one top 10 12 cause death general population . Approximately 150,000 people die annually.1 On microscopic level impairment relationship oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) consumption ( VO2 ) suggestive defect microcirculatory perfusion septic shock.2,3,4 These alteration include decrease proportion perfuse vessel small 20 μm , mostly capillaries whereas flow large perfusion vessel preserve . As micro-circulation alteration persist multiple organ failure death ensues,4 thus intervention able improve microcirculation may reduce tissue dysoxia . De Backer et . al.3 report topical application acetylcholine restore normal microcirculatory flow pattern patient septic shock , indicate important role micro-vascular endothelium , alteration manipulate . Other experimental study several vasodilatory compound show improve micro-vascular perfusion5,6,7,8,9 even associate improved outcomes.7,10 In human study , Spronk et . al.11 observe intravenous administration nitroglycerin result marked improvement capillary perfusion , intervention may produce severe arterial hypotension also increase nitric oxide mediate cytoxic effects.12,13 In another human study , De Baker et . al.14 demonstrate administration 5 μg/kg-min dobutamine improve restore capillary perfusion patient septic shock change independent change systemic hemodynamic variable . The concomitant decrease blood lactate level suggest change micro-vascular perfusion associate improved cellular metabolism . However , dobutamine may also produce hypotension patient hypovolemia . Erythropoietin ( EPO ) , sialoglycoprotein hormone produce adult kidney , major regulator red blood cell production recently suggest favourable effect tissue injury vascular function . It stimulate proliferation commit erythroid progenitor cell development mature erythrocytes.15 Thus , potential benefit erythropoietin therapy patient anemia secondary chronic renal failure long recognized.16 Recombinant Human EPO ( rh-EPO ) indicate treatment anemia associate chronic renal failure , non-myeloid malignancy due effect concomitantly administer chemotherapy , zidovudine treat HIV infect patient patient go major elective surgery facilitate autologous blood collection thus reduce allogenic blood exposure . In critically ill adult specifically sepsis , EPO level show relatively low respect level anemia present.17,18 As well , correlation find erythropoietin concentration biological marker tissue hypoperfusion i.e . lactate level PCO2 gap.19 A common adverse effect rh-EPO therapy renal patient development hypertension . The acute effect rh-EPO arterial vasoactivity suggest direct indirect action occur prior effect erythropoeisis . In addition hematopoietic effect , rh-EPO also significant cardiovascular effects,20,21 include direct vasopressor effect.22 In rat splanchnic artery occlusion shock model , treatment rh-EPO inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) activity prevent overproduction NO vivo restore responsiveness Phenylephrine.23,24 Rh-EPO direct vasopressor effect smooth muscle cell , express EPO receptor , modulate intracellular Ca++.25 An increase plasma level endothelium derive vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 occur rh-EPO treatment.26,27,28 Indirect effect EPO treatment may also increase activity autonomic nervous system increase sensitivity angiotensin II , potent vasoconstrictor.29 We recently report rh-EPO septic mouse model produce immediate increase perfuse capillary density concomitant decrease NADH fluorescence , indirect measure indicate improvement mitochondical oxidative phosphorylation , skeletal muscle . Thus , rh-EPO appear improve tissue bioenergetics septic mouse model part maintain DO2 via increase perfused capillary density.30 The recently develop , noninvasive orthogonal polarization spectral ( OPS ) image technique apply investigate human vasculature.34 Polarized light define wavelength ( 548 nm ) emit illuminate area interest , reflect background absorb hemoglobin , produce high-contrast image micro-circulation . This technique particularly convenient study tissue protect thin epithelial layer , mucosal surface35 validate effective method micro-vascular imaging animals34 , 36,37 humans.38 The OPS technique use observe major micro-vascular blood flow alteration patient severe sepsis3 include decreased vascular density , especially small vessel ; large number non-perfused intermittently perfuse small vessel ; mark perfusion heterogeneity areas.39 These alteration severe non-survivors survivor affect global hemodynamic state vasopressor agents.39 The persistence micro-vascular alteration patient poor outcome emphasize potential role micro-circulatory disturbance pathophysiology sepsis-induced multiple organ failure . In study , use OPS imaging technique investigate sublingual microcirculation patient septic shock treatment single dose rh-EPO . We hypothesize rh-EPO improve sepsis-related alteration micro-circulatory perfusion , independent systemic hemodynamic effect .</detailed_description>
