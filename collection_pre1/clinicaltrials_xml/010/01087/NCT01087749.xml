	<detailed_description>It demonstrate protein know drug transporter different human organ tissue important drug absorb , distribute , metabolize , eliminate ( ADME ) 18 . The chemical property drug affect whether need transporter protein enter cell . It well known protein affect chronic disease different drug may absorb , metabolize , eliminate differently certain disease . Preliminary study suggest drug ( require drug transporter protein ) may show altered elimination presence uremic toxin . Uremic toxins substance accumulate blood patient chronic kidney disease many remove hemodialysis ( HD ) . We hypothesize different class drug ( BDDCS class1 , 2 , 3 ) different degree change AUC , mean class 1 drug would see less change AUC class 3 drug class 3 drug require transporter . Previous study ca n't make comparison use different patient drug , even change class 1 drug , ca n't compare class 3 drug . In order get accurate comparison , test three drug patient see AUC change drug drug within patient compare healthy volunteer ( take three drug ) .</detailed_description>
