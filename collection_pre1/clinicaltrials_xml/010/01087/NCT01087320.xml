	<brief_summary>Background : - A number rare inherited disease affect patient , genetic cause condition remain unknown . Researchers study use new technology call whole genome sequencing learn gene gene cause condition . Understanding gene cause diseases important improve diagnosis treatment affect patient . Objectives : - To identify genetic cause disorder difficult identify exist technique . - To develop best practice medical counseling challenge whole genome sequencing . Eligibility : - Individuals one rare disorder consideration study . These condition generally genetic cause disorder unknown . The eligibility individual participant decide case-by-case basis researcher . - Family member affected individual , family member ( often parent ) may provide genetic information . Design : - Participants study least one case several follow procedure : - A medical genetics evaluation . - Other test may include x-ray , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) exam , consultation doctor . Not study necessary person , information test may require proceed gene sequence study . - Clinical photograph document certain aspect disorder . - Blood skin biopsy sample , tissue sample , require study doctor . - Genetic testing , decide researcher . However , participant study expect undergo whole genome sequencing , technique study person gene . - Some participant may ask take part telephone interview and/or web-based survey . - Participants choice kind result whole genome sequence wish learn . - After test complete result genetic study know , participant offer return visit National Institutes Health learn result . During visit , participant ask complete survey participate interview relate decision participate study learn individual genetic test result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We aim use whole-genome medical sequencing ( WGMS ) discover causative molecular lesion set rare , severe phenotype hypothesize cause either somatic mutation , germline de novo heterozygous mutation , germline inherit recessive , germline inherit dominant mutation currently unknown uncharacterized gene . The goal research threefold : identify causative sequence variant disorder whose molecular etiology previously unknown , apply insight rare disorder study common phenotype , enhance study mutation genome-wide level . We plan recruit approximately three six affected individual along parent phenotype study . Prospectively recruited trio bring NIH Clinical Center brief clinical evaluation molecular evaluation . Each trio consent whole genome sequence option learn clinically relevant result , , explain disorder question ( refer primary variant ) well clinically relevant finding discover incidentally part WGMS process ( refer secondary variant ) . Participants offer return visit NIH learn result , ask complete survey participate interview relate decision participation study learn individual genotype result . The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center ( NISC ) screen sequence variant conform hypothesize inheritance pattern . These variant validate , example use trio de novo phenotype , additional case . We start develop analytic algorithm distinguish potentially pathogenic genetic alteration normal variation . All sequence variant deem clinically relevant validate CLIA-certified laboratory result return participant , choose learn finding . This protocol design way provide long-term potential pursue many different clinical project .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : An individual affect disorder study . We provide list exemplar disorder Appendix A . As state , individual generally represent simplex case rare phenotype whose molecular etiology unknown . A family member affect individual family member ( often parent ) potentially informative useful linkage bioinformatic analysis genetic variant . Probands minor decisionallyimpaired adult eligible parent legal guardian authority sign consent form behalf . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Probands adult decisionallyimpaired ineligible legal guardian authority sign consent form behalf . Subjects know , significant affective psychiatric disorder , judgment team , may impair ability understand appropriately use complex medical genetic information consider decisionallyimpaired ineligible unless appoint ( , case minor child , custody ) appropriate surrogate decisionmaker .</criteria>
