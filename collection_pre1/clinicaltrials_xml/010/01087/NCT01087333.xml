	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study hairy cell leukemia , disease compare disorder , interested obtain additional sample leukemia patient healthy volunteer . The investigator particularly interested sample individual disease treat new type drug call immunotoxin , antibody carry toxin bind cancer cell allow toxin kill cell . Objectives : - To collect variety clinical sample , include blood , urine , lymph sample , tissue , order study sample develop new treatment leukemia . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose leukemia kind blood lymphatic system cancer , healthy volunteer . Design : - Individuals leukemia ask provide blood , bone marrow , urine , tumor tissue sample request researcher . Healthy volunteer provide blood urine sample . - No treatment give part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Human Samples Study Hairy Cell Other Leukemias , Develop Recombinant Immunotoxins Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) highly responsive curable standard chemotherapy , also respond well investigational agent call recombinant immunotoxins develop Laboratory Molecular Biology ( LMB ) . - The investigator protocol study molecular clinical aspect HCL , compare normal disorder , include chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . - Recombinant immunotoxins fusion proteins contain bacterial toxin connect target ligand , like single-chain antibody growth factor . Recombinant immunotoxins currently clinical development LMB include BL22 high affinity variant , HA22 , target CD22 , LMB-2 , target CD25 , SS1P , target Mesothelin . - LMB-2 , BL22 HA22 test purine analog resistant HCL . - Other LMB trial include LMB-2 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , adult T-cell leukemia , HA22 non-Hodgkin lymphoma CLL . Objectives : - To allow collection variety clinical sample , include blood , urine , lymphopheresis sample , tissue , good understand disease process study , determine eligibility and/or optimal time clinical testing . Specific project plan may include : - study antibody make immunotoxins - quantify tumor antigen flow cytometry method - test well recombinant immunotoxins agent kill tumor cell ex vivo - molecularly characterize malignant B-cells sequence immunoglobulin rearrangement gene . Eligibility : - Samples easily obtain , include blood urine , may obtain patient normal volunteer . - Samples require procedure , include bone marrow biopsy/aspiration , leukopheresis , procedure do medical need , may obtain patient . Design : - Patients normal donor consent protocol sample obtain . - This protocol involve treatment , although patient may also therapy protocol treatment .</detailed_description>
