	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested develop registry protocol obtain biologic environmental sample anonymously adult volunteer use laboratory test study . The sample use determine new test sufficiently valid precise use research study quality control purpose . Objectives : - To provide registry sample test development , validation , analysis , quality control National Institute Environmental Health Sciences . Eligibility : - Male nonpregnant female volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Samples collect include blood , urine , saliva , household dust , cheek cell , hair , nasal cell , stool , nail clipping , exhale breath condensate , sperm . - Specimens may collect one-time sample collection , participant may ask provide specimen several occasion specify period , exceed 1 year . - Eligible participant ask come clinical research unit blood drawn noninvasive sample retrieve . Prior blood draw , researcher administer brief past 24-hour questionnaire research purpose . Specimens collect use standard clinical protocol . - Participants receive monetary compensation provide sample protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose registry protocol use obtain biologic environmental sample anonymously adult volunteer use laboratory assay evaluation . The sample use determine new test sufficiently valid precise use research study quality control purpose . In study involve storage analysis laboratory specimen , essential evaluate performance available assay actively assess impact storage handle quality sample laboratory analysis . Specifically , essential 1 ) demonstrate assay sufficiently reproducible stable time difference level among individual population detect ; 2 ) evaluate assay reliability sending blind anonymous sample along study sample test labs quality control purpose ; 3 ) test propose laboratory method use replicate sample population order choose laboratory method great precision , ; 4 ) ass sample collection , handle , storage procedure affect measure level specific analytes allow inform decision whether proceed specific analysis . Under protocol , assay could include evaluation immunologic parameter , gene gene product , peptide , protein , hormone , lipid , viability cell , evaporation dilution effect , chemical toxin metabolites , micronutrient , metal . For sample , lymphocyte extract use study lymphocytes and/or immortalized cell . Samples collect include blood , urine , saliva , household dust , cheek cell , hair , nasal cell , stool , nail clipping , exhale breath condensate , sperm sample , skin cell , and/or sputum . In addition , pulmonary function test ( PFT ) may conduct collect lung function information . Since important collect sample general population , protocol cover collection sample non-pregnant adult ( male female , age 18+ ) . Specimens may collect one-time sample collection , participant may ask provide specimen several occasion specify period , exceed one year .</detailed_description>
