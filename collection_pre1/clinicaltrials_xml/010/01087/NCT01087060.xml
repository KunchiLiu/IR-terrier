	<brief_summary>The aim study show additional diagnostic criterion compute tomography ( CT ) scan diagnose predict detection recurrence cystic renal cell carcinoma patient complicate renal cyst . Furthermore , would demonstrate relationship complicate renal cyst diagnose Bosniak system parameter pathological result . The analysis detection time renal malignancy would help determine practical guideline follow-up plan complicate renal cyst .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Even though many trial error enhance diagnostic accuracy CT scan complicate cyst , trial obtain enhanced accuracy use CT scan would still valuable , consider widespread use . A previous study demonstrate enhancement HU intravenous administration contrast material CT scan 15 HU would `` almost always indicative pathologic process although always malignancy '' , another study show cut-off 42 47 HU gap would helpful prediction renal malignancy .</detailed_description>
