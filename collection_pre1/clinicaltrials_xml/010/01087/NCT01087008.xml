	<brief_summary>Assessment antitumour effect zoledronic acid patient multiple myeloma asymptomatic biochemical relapse It´s propose investigate use Zoledronic acid single therapy patient Multiple Myeloma biochemical relapse . The following must note : - Patients formal indication chemotherapy treatment include , patient symptomatic myeloma respond show biochemical relapse generally treat . This allow generate group patient untreated , additional treatment treatment group zoledronic acid . - As relapse symptomatic patient , number far high patient quiescent Multiple Myeloma . This allow expect good enrolment . - There reliable data symptom progression biochemical relapse , though one new objective occur almost clinical trial myeloma . In VISTA study , estimate median time new treatment 5 month ( combine progression-free time time next treatment ) . This time much short median quiescent myeloma progression-free survival , long follow-up time necessary patient group . - The administration drug patient help prevent skeleton-related complication future , study secondary objective study .</brief_summary>
