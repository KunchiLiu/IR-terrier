	<brief_summary>It well know airway management difficult pregnancy . Increased risk difficult intubation pregnant woman often report . Thus , pregnancy regard period high anesthesiologic risk . Generalized weight gain well know factor influence upper airway pregnant woman . However , modification airway less well document . The acoustic reflection method base analysis reflection single transient planar wave allow analysis longitudinal cross-sectional area profile examine cavity . It noninvasive harmless method . The aim study evaluate acoustic reflection method physiological modification upper airways pregnancy . Women enrol study undergo acoustic recording first , second , third trimester pregnancy , well two day one month delivery . Forty pregnant woman include monocentric , prospective , open label study . Moreover , single acoustic recording perform 10 pregnant woman undergo MRI obstetrical purpose . The estimated caliber upper airways MRI acoustic method compare .</brief_summary>
