	<brief_summary>Background : - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT ) procedure transplant bone marrow cell ( stem cell ) match donor recipient order allow donor stem cell produce cell attack recipient cancer cell . AlloHSCT perform chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiation therapy adequately control cancer growth . However , cancer control alloHSCT frequently become resistant standard treatment option . - The outcome alloHSCT might improve certain kind white blood cell ( T cell ) could manipulate generate potent effect cancer cell . This effect augment genetically engineering donor T cell specifically recognize cancerous cell order attack . For purpose , researcher study specific kind genetically engineer T cell know anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell . More research need determine T cell effective treatment certain kind B cell cancer ( non-Hodgkin lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) control alloHSCT . Objectives : - To assess safety effectiveness administer allogeneic anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell patient B-cell cancer respond alloHSCT . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 75 year age receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation B cell cancer , whose cancer either respond recur transplant . - Recipients must stem cell donor previous procedure . Design : - Before start study , participant screen medical history blood test . Recipients tumor image scan , additional blood test , test direct study doctor . - Donor participant undergo apheresis provide white blood cell researcher use treatment . - Recipients dose escalation determine effective yet safe dose anti-CD19 T cell . There four dose level anti-CD19 T cell . The first patient enrol small dose , dose increase level determine safe . To reduce risk side effect , participant receive stem cell transplant unrelated donor receive low dose anti-CD19 T cell receive transplant related donor . - Recipients hospitalize 3 day receive cell infusion , need come clinic follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 12 week infusion . - Additional scan frequent blood test require first 3 month infusion , follow less frequent visit time . - Recipients follow maximum 15 year receive infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration Anti-CD19-chimeric-antigen-receptor-transduced T Cells From Original Transplant Donor Patients With Recurrent Persistent B-cell Malignancies After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Many patient advance B-cell malignancy cure chemotherapy monoclonal antibody prolong relapse-free survival allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT ) ; however , substantial fraction patient B-cell malignancy relapse follow alloHSCT . The first therapeutic maneuver attempt patient without graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) relapse alloHSCT usually withdraw immunosuppressive drug . If remission occur withdraw immunosuppression , patient often treat donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . Withdraw immunosuppression DLI lead complete remission patient B-cell malignancy relapse alloHSCT . Unfortunately , substantial fraction patient enter complete remission withdraw immunosuppression follow DLI , therapy often complicate GVHD . The outcome alloHSCT might improve T cell could manipulate generate potent graft-versus-malignancy ( GVM ) effect unmanipulated T cell . We hypothesize GVM effect B-cell malignancy augment genetically engineering donor T cell express receptor specifically recognize antigen express malignant B cell . Chimeric antigen receptor ( CARs ) consist antigen recognition moiety combine T-cell signal domain . CARs capable activate T cell antigen-specific manner . Expression CD19 antigen limit B cell perhaps follicular dendritic cell . Most malignant B cell express CD19 . We construct retroviral vector encode anti-CD19 CAR . Large number T cell transduce retroviral vector generate vitro clinical adoptive T cell therapy . These anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell specifically recognize variety CD19+ target cell kill primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cell vitro . Anti-CD19-CAR-expressing T cell previously use treat patient alloHSCT . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To assess safety administer allogeneic anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell patient B-cell malignancy persistent relapse alloHSCT . The allogeneic anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell derive original allogeneic transplant donor . Secondary Objectives : To determine administer anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell cause regression B-cell malignancy relapse persistent alloHSCT . To measure persistence adoptively-transferred anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell blood patient . To assess impact pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen plus allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T cell patient residual malignancy receive allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T cell alone . ELIGIBILITY : Patients CD19-expressing malignancy persistent recurrent follow successful T-cell engraftment HLA-identical sibling , 1-antigen mismatch related , great equal 7/8-matched unrelated donor ( URD ) alloHSCT sequential treatment withdraw immunosuppression DLI . Patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia also eligible alloHSCT withdraw immunosuppression whether receive DLI . The donor provide cell alloHSCT must willing able undergo leukapheresis cell obtain prepare anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell . The recipient must grade I acute GVHD ( see Appendix 1 ) mild global score chronic GVHD ( see Appendix 9 ) . The recipient must receive systemic immunosuppressive drug least 28 day time study enrollment . DESIGN : The alloHSCT donor undergo leukapheresis . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) alloHSCT donor culture anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3 interleukin-2 ( aldesleukin ) . The cell transduce replication-incompetent gammaretroviruses encode anti-CD19 CAR . The transduced T cell proliferate vitro 15 20 day . The transduced T cell refer anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell . Separate dose-escalations perform recipient related ( HLA-identical 1-antigen mismatch ) transplant URD transplant . For dose-escalation , least 3 patient study maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine high dose level study find safe . After MTDs determine recipient related transplant recipient URD transplant , subsequent patient enrol protocol treat MTD cell transplant type . Recipients monitor development acute treatment-related toxicity least 10 day cell infusion inpatient . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) include severe acute GVHD 4 toxicity associate GVHD . A maximum 48 patient ( donor plus recipient ) treat . Assessment safety primary objective clinical trial . Safety define lack severe acute post-infusional toxicity incidence GVHD high historical rate GVHD occur standard DLI . Anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T-cell persistence peripheral blood measure multiple time point 1 week 1 year anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell infusion flow cytometry . To assess anti-malignancy effect infused cell , patient stag use standard stag system . For patient residual malignancy original anti-CD19 CAR infusion , additional treatment pentostatin cyclophosphamide follow anti-CD19 CAR T cell anti-CDCAR T cell alone potentially possible .</detailed_description>
