	<detailed_description>Adherence medication critical manage chronic disease , yet remain issue across chronic condition . Poor medication adherence lead deteriorate health subsequently increase cost result high hospitalization rate . Medication adherence chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) especially important successful treatment slow progression end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , yet little research focus adherence patient early CKD . Numerous barrier medication adherence exist , include prescription complex medication regimen , often asymptomatic nature early CKD , lack social support treatment adherence . While technology support-based intervention show promise , currently gold-standard approach improve medication adherence . Thus , essential pursue novel intervention address barrier patient CKD improve medication adherence slow progression ESRD . The long-range goal application improve medication adherence chronic illness development effective intervention capitalize patient ' medication-taking context . The objective application , next step achieve goal , pilot test impact acceptability MedMinder , pillbox device transmit medication-taking data via secure internet-interface patient , family member , care manager , group adult , Harvard Pilgrim Health Care ( HPHC ) member CKD . To achieve objective , partnership HPHC , recruit 120 member diagnose CKD stage III IV participate 6-month pre-post randomized-controlled trial . Participants randomize either receive use MedMinder six-month period access telephone care management , receive usual care regular pillbox access telephone care management . Our primary aim test feasibility acceptability MedMinder intervention . The main component intervention include : ( 1 ) plastic weekly pill box programmable visual auditory cue prompt medication use , ( 2 ) generation missed-dose alert send via email , text message , telephone patient , family member , HPHC care manager , ( 3 ) secure internet site permit customization alert graphical representation medication use , ( 4 ) aggregate adherence report available CKD care manager patient participate HPHC care management . Our secondary aim assess impact acceptability family friend involvement CKD member medication take . We document family friend activity relate medication taking , acceptability family friend involvement member medication taking , impact involvement medication use . Findings propose project would provide information feasibility technology-based adherence intervention , medication-taking support , patient chronic disease . The result pilot inform future application adequately power study examine intervention measurement structure support others medication taking .</detailed_description>
