	<brief_summary>The use iliac crest bone graft ( ICBG ) remain gold-standard spinal reconstructive surgery achieve fusion . Major complication harvest ICBG rare , chronic pain report 10-39 % . Catheters implant time surgery use provide local anesthetic harvest site 24-48 hour surgery . This show decrease chronic pain 4 year post-operatively . A single application local anesthetic surgery show decrease pain harvest site 5 day . No study demonstrate benefit use single application local anesthetic ICBG site beyond 5 day . In current clinical practice , use local anesthetic ICBG site determine accord surgeon preference . The purpose study determine single application bupivacaine ICBG site , currently do case , provide pain relief beyond 5 day demonstrate long infusion local anesthetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use local anesthetic donor site investigated decrease morbidity iliac crest bone harvesting . Along decrease early post-operative pain may expect [ 1 , 5 , 18-22 ] , decrease chronic pain improve long-term result also demonstrate [ 1 , 4 , 19 ] . Local anesthetic may cause long-term result dampen initial chemical response injury reduce release inflammatory mediator neutrophil , neutrophil adhesion endothelium , formation free oxygen radical . [ 4 , 23 ] Most study utilize continuous periodic infusion anesthetic catheter place time surgery 24-48 hour postoperatively . The drawback use catheter include increase infection risk [ 24 ] increase cost continuous infusion use [ 5 ] . A single treatment local anesthetic time surgery therefore preferable . Only one study evaluate single injection local anesthetic adult spine patient , demonstrate decrease pain narcotic usage 5 post-operative day . [ 20 ] No study date demonstrate decrease intermediate long-term donor site pain single application anesthetic , achieve previous study utilize post-operative infusion via catheter . Participants study identify attend surgeon study ( RD , CD ) , clinical faculty within department orthopaedics board certify spine surgery . Randomization do random selection seal envelope attend physician time enrollment . Sealed envelope contain paper assigns patient treatment ( bupivacaine bone harvest site ) placebo ( normal saline bone harvest site ) group . Note surgical wound routinely irrigate normal saline prior skin closure . In control group , 10ml normal saline use ICBG site . In treatment group , 10ml bupivacaine 0.5 % administer directly surgical wound , do case currently . Therefore , new procedure protocol outside already do practice . The current practice use versus use local anesthetic iliac crest bone graft site discretion attend surgeon . Please note randomization study nothing surgery do , patient treat accord standard care regardless randomization . There differences treatment two study group . There deviation normal post-operative care receive . Patients tell whether receive bupivacaine iliac crest bone graft site time surgery . The patient blind treatment group throughout study . At patient 's request , informed treatment group end study . The attend surgeon blind treatment group . The PI blind treatment group . Background information patient pain assessment do time enrollment ask participant fill paper questionnaire . Paper questionnaires assess patient 's pain level give collected patient discharge hospital , first follow appointment ( approximately 2-4 week postoperatively ) , next follow appointment ( approximately 3 month postoperatively ) . In addition , patient give paper narcotic log enter daily oral narcotic usage time discharge first follow appointment . The paper questionnaires narcotic log contain medical record number date surgery include name . All paper form collect stored attending surgeon appropriate time point describe . This data enter secure password-protected database ( RedCap ) PI . After data entry paper questionnaire form dispose hospital-approved shredder receptacle . All investigator access database , maintain PI study conclude .</detailed_description>
