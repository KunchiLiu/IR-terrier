	<brief_summary>The propose project aim : 1 . Obtain preliminary assessment efficacy topiramate treatment reduce alcohol use veterans Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) alcohol dependence ; 2 . Obtain preliminary assessment safety/tolerability topiramate patient ; 3 . Assess feasibility recruitment retention topiramate treatment comorbid population ; 4 ) inform design plan subsequent large control trial topiramate . PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS : Topiramate treatment combine Medical Management alcohol counseling associate significant decrease percent drinking day baseline end treatment . SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS : There significantly less percent drinking day topiramate treatment group compare placebo group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topiramate Treatment Alcohol Use Disorders Veterans With Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) : A Pilot Controlled Trial Augmentation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal propose project improve treatment veteran co-occurring Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) alcohol dependence . Exposure stress combat know associate risk PTSD alcohol substance use . PTSD alcohol use disorder occur frequently among return OEF/OIF veteran . Alcohol substance use risk factor development PTSD , moderator PTSD symptom severity , potential consequence PTSD . Alcohol far common substance abuse patient PTSD , use may represent attempt PTSD patient `` self-medicate '' symptom hyperarousal . However , date little research develop pharmacotherapies would , ideally , reduce alcohol use PTSD symptom . Topiramate one medication alcohol dependence also test potential medication treat PTSD . Topiramate 's efficacy alcohol dependence show two recent large control trial . Several open trial suggest topiramate may effective reduce PTSD symptom result two small control trial mixed . A clinical trial topiramate therefore indicate order achieve follow specific aim : The primary aim obtain preliminary assessment efficacy topiramate increase percent day abstinent alcohol use baseline end treatment veteran PTSD alcohol abuse/dependence drink heavily . The secondary aim obtain preliminary assessment efficacy topiramate increase percent day abstinent alcohol compare placebo . Additional aim include follow : - To obtain preliminary assessment efficacy topiramate reduce measure alcohol use percent heavy drinking day , number drink per week , number drink per drinking day , alcohol craving . - To obtain preliminary assessment efficacy topiramate reduce PTSD symptom severity veterans chronic PTSD alcohol abuse/dependence . - Informing design plan subsequent large control trial topiramate veteran chronic PTSD alcohol abuse/dependence - To obtain estimate topiramate vs. placebo effect size future study . B . To obtain preliminary assessment effect topiramate treatment measure risk-taking behavior veteran chronic PTSD alcohol abuse/dependence . To achieve aim , conduct prospective , parallel group , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled flexible-dose pilot clinical trial topiramate veteran PTSD alcohol abuse/dependence already receive standard treatment PTSD still drink heavily . The primary treatment outcome percent day abstinent alcohol ; secondary outcome include alcohol use measure , PTSD symptom severity , adverse effect , recruitment retention rate .</detailed_description>
