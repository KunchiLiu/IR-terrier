	<brief_summary>T2DM become American Epidemic . Currently 8 % US population diabetes rate may high 33 % year 2050 ( 1 ) . Although many treatment option people T2DM , none proven human prevent defect insulin secretion ( 2 ) insulin action ( 3 ) beta cell dysfunction ( 4 ) result high glucose level typically worsen disease progress . Any treatment could delay progression pancreatic beta cell failure ( measure need rescue therapy oral agent ) would significant advancement diabetes treatment . Insulin therapy appropriate point T2DM disease progression , commonly use rescue therapy failure oral therapy . A number outpatient insulin titration protocol show safe effective speed patient 's ability gain glucose control ( 5-8 ) . Recent study show initiation insulin onset T2DM beneficial achieve early long-term glucose control ( 6-9 ) . However protocol use intravenous human insulin in-patient setting , continuous subcutaneous insulin insulin pump old human insulin out-patient set . Many protocol unlikely utilized routine patient care . To date , `` insulin first '' study publish analog insulin outpatient basal-bolus regimen patient driven titration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INSPIRE Diabetes Study : Basal Bolus Insulin Primary Treatment Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin , use initial treatment T2DM , great potential produce glucose control faster treatment regimen . However , typically use treatment last resort T2DM . In study , investigator offer novel approach use insulin initial therapy new-onset T2DM aim determine efficacy toward produce last glucose control . Hypothesis : Treating newly diagnose T2DM patient insulin therapy versus standard care short period time lead improvement glycemic control durable beyond length time take insulin may improve beta cell function . Primary endpoint : Time need rescue therapy , Need rescue therapy time point . A1C change 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . Secondary endpoint : Mean glucose mean fast glucose 3 , 6 , 12 month . C-peptide , HOMA-B , HOMA-IR , A1C time point , OGTT week 12 56 . Total number hypoglycemic event ( minor major ) tolerability base side effect . Treatment arm : Weight base protocol insulin Glargine Glulisine . Control arm : oral medication per ADA 2009 recommend treatment algorithm . Rescue group available arm initial 12 week .</detailed_description>
