	<criteria>Subjects must 18 old . Subjects must clinical indication coronary intervention . CK CKMB must less equal upper limit lab normal value within 8 hour prior procedure . The target lesion must de novo coronary lesion previously treat interventional procedure . The target vessel must native coronary artery stenosis &gt; = 70 % &lt; 100 % . The target vessel reference diameter must &gt; = 2.5mm &lt; = 4.0 mm . The lesion length must exceed 40 mm . The target vessel must TIMI flow 3 baseline . The target lesion must evidence severe calcium deposit lesion site base protocol criterion . The lesion must crossable study guide wire . Inability understand study history noncompliance medical advice . Unwilling unable sign ORBIT II Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . History cognitive mental health status would interfere study participation . Currently enrol preapproval investigational study ( apply longterm postmarket study unless study might clinically interfere current study endpoint ( e.g. , limit use studyrequired medication , etc. ) . Female subject pregnant plan become pregnant within study period . Known hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , ticlopidine clopidogrel without adequate alternative medication . Known sensitivity contrast medium , adequately premedicated . Diagnosed chronic renal failure serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl . Experienced acute MI ( STEMI nonSTEMI : CK CKMB great 1 time upper limit lab normal ) within 30 day prior index procedure . History major cardiovascular intervention within 30 day . Evidence current ( within 6 month ) leave ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 25 % . NYHA class III IV heart failure . History stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 6 month .
