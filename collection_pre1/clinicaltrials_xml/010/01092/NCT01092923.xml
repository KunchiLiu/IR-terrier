It show similar effect speed uptake accompany agent like sevoflurane ( `` second gas effect '' ) , much slow pharmacokinetics . A recent study u suggest promotes faster smoother onset anaesthesia , measure use standard monitor depth anaesthesia ( BIS monitor ) . This finding require confirmation prospectively large group patient . We hypothesise similar effect also exist washout sevoflurane end procedure , promote quicker recovery ( emergence ) anaesthesia . This never previously demonstrate . This information help well define place nitrous oxide achieve optimal outcome modern anaesthetic practice . We propose conduct simple study measure effect nitrous oxide washin washout exhale concentration accompany sevoflurane induction anaesthesia emergence , identify accompany effect rate change depth anaesthesia use BIS . Consenting adult participant recruit undergoing general anaesthesia elective surgery anticipate take minimum 1 hour arterial line consider appropriate monitoring blood pressure . As , normal practice , decision whether include nitrous oxide anaesthetic mixture largely discretionary part anaesthetist , therefore allocation either arm protocol consistent routine practice , intend patient approached consent admission hospital surgery . Standard patient monitoring use include BIS 2 mL sample blood take assess blood gas content lung function optimise lung ventilation . Following induction anaesthesia , participant receive inhale gas mixture contain standard concentration sevoflurane . They randomise treatment group standard concentration nitrous oxide include mixture , control group nitrous oxide include . Monitoring record exhale gas concentration make continuous sample gas breathing circuit computer storage . We hypothesise rate fall exhale sevoflurane concentration end anaesthesia rapid group patient breathe gas mixture contain nitrous oxide , rate fall BIS induction rate rise BIS emergence faster nitrous oxide group .</detailed_description>
