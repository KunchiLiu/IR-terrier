	<detailed_description>Title : Esteem® Totally Implantable Hearing System Clinical Trial Purpose : To evaluate safety efficacy Esteem® Totally Implantable Hearing System ( hereafter call Esteem® System ) subject suffer mild severe hearing loss . Trial Design : This pivotal trial design prospective , multi-center , non-randomized , clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy Esteem® System . For trial subject act control . This trial design meet United States ' regulatory requirement . Enrollment Size : It currently estimate 50-60 subject enrol trial . Subject Population : Adult subject mild severe sensorineural hearing loss , healthy middle ear , speech discrimination score equal well 40 % , previously wear hearing aid minimum 3 month average daily use rate least 4 hour eligible inclusion trial . See detailed inclusion/exclusion criterion specific . Primary Objectives : 1 . To demonstrate Esteem® System improve speech threshold sensitivity hear identify speech signal well well pre-implant hearing aid ( aided condition ) . Endpoint : Comparison speech reception threshold ( SRT ) use Esteem® System ( 4 month post activation ) compare pre-implant aided condition . 2 . To demonstrate Esteem® System 4 month post- activation visit effective well hear aid improve speech discrimination ( intelligibility ) show word recognition score 50 dB . Endpoint : Comparison word recognition score use Esteem® 4 month post-activation compare pre-implant aided condition . 3 . To determine incidence Serious Adverse Device Effects ( SADE ) incidence rate device failures replacement . Endpoint : The analysis incidence SADEs device failure replacements follow-up . 4 . To demonstrate subject ' cochlear function remain unchanged Esteem® System show comparison subject ' pre-implant baseline bone conduction threshold versus subject ' 4 month post-activation visit bone conduction threshold . Endpoint : Comparison bone conduction threshold ( BC ) use forehead placement 4 month post activation compare pre-implant BC threshold . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To demonstrate Esteem® System 4 month post activation visit improve 3-frequency ( 500 , 1000 , 2000 Hz ) pure tone average ( PTA ) compare baseline unaided condition . 2 . To demonstrate Esteem® System 4 month post-activation visit effective well hear aid improve speech discrimination ( intelligibility ) show QuickSIN ( speech noise ) test result . 3 . To show Esteem® System improve Quality-of-Life compare baseline aid condition show APHAB result . 4 . To gather subject feedback comment use Esteem® System relative pre-implant hearing aid ( aided condition ) show Esteem® Questionnaire .</detailed_description>
