	<brief_summary>Background : - Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia ( BL ) highly treatable , standard therapy require multiple dos intensive chemotherapy may require long hospital stay frequently severe side effect . In addition , BL fairly common type cancer patient also human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , treatment outcome poor standard treatment work well HIV-positive patient intense treatment regimens highly toxic . New approach need expand way treat BL efficiency reduce side effect . - DA-EPOCH-R standard chemotherapy treatment consist drug etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , rituximab . It may able treat BL similar effectiveness few side effect . Researchers interested confirm result previous study investigate effectiveness DA-EPOCH-R treating BL . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness DA-EPOCH-R treat Burkitt lymphoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose Burkitt lymphoma prior chemotherapy treatment . Design : - Individuals series blood test determine suitability participate study . Eligible participant divide high-risk low-risk group base disease prognosis possibility BL may already spread central nervous system . - Participants receive intravenous infusion six chemotherapy drug DA-EPOCH-R 21-day treatment cycle . The exact dos adjust depend participant white blood cell count test . - High-risk participant receive six cycle DA-EPOCH-R. To treat BL may enter central nervous system , high-risk participant also receive infusion chemotherapy drug spinal fluid . - Low-risk participant receive six cycle DA-EPOCH-R , additional dose rituximab cycle . - Frequent blood urine test perform treatment , well body image scan test cancer progression direct study doctor . Participants receive additional medicine help prevent possible adverse side effect DA-EPOCH-R. - Participants respond successfully treatment ask return follow-up exam every 3 month first 18 month , every year next 3 year . Participants respond successfully treatment give opportunity participate additional research treatment protocol , available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Dose-Adjusted EPOCH-Rituximab Adults With Untreated Burkitt Lymphoma c-MYC+ Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia ( BL ) highly curable . Standard treatment employ doseintense multi-agent chemotherapy though effective associate high morbidity . Therefore , novel approach need improve therapeutic index BL maintain improve efficacy . In HIV+ BL , outcome poor , mainly due use CHOP base regimens disease . - Two NCI phase II trial use EPOCH chemotherapy 1 2 dos rituximab ( R ) per cycle untreated BL . ( Dose-adjusted ) DA-EPOCH-Rituximab use in16 HIV negative BL , 8 HIV positive patient receive 3 4 cycle EPOCHRR minimize toxicity risk opportunistic infection . All patient remain continuous remission . Treatment well tolerate represent novel therapeutic strategy BL . - This trial seek ass effectiveness risk adaptive approach DA-EPOCHR untreated BL ( HIV+/- ) . Because treatment represent major conceptual departure standard treatment , important obtain additional Phase II result limited/advanced stage BL -c-MYC positive DLBCL rare variant DLBCL . There little data biology disease optimal therapeutic approach define . Therefore , base impression behave aggressively likely characterize high tumor proliferation rate , plan accrue patient disease addition BL patient . -Plasmablastic lymphoma , another variant DLBCL frequently characterize activation MYC poor outcome historically standard treatment . We plan include patient study also . As CD20 negative , receive DA-EPOCH without Rituximab . Objectives : - Determine PFS , EFS OS risk adaptive DA-EPOCH-R untreated BL c-MYC + DLBCL DA-EPOCH c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma . - Assess predictive value early FDG-PET/CT scan PFS . - Obtain pilot comparative molecular profile HIV negative positive BL c- MYC + DLBCL , include c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma . Eligibility : -Burkitt lymphoma , c-MYC + DLBCL c-MYC + plasmablastic lymphoma age ( Bullet ) 18 year . -No prior treatment except limited-field radiotherapy , short course glucocorticoid and/or cyclophosphamide urgent problem diagnosis . -Adequate major organ function unless impairment due lymphoma . Study Design : -Phase II Study risk adapt DA-EPOCH-R BL , c-MYC + DLBCL DA-EPOCH c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma - Low risk : DA-EPOCH-RR x 3 cycle . - High risk , c-MYC + DLBCL c-MYC+ plasmablastic lymphoma : DA-EPOCH ( +/- ) R x 6 cycle 8 cycle select patient . - CSF cytology flow cytometry analysis BL . - High Risk CSF negative - Prophylactic intrathecal treatment - CSF positive - Active intrathecal treatment - FDG-PET/CT pre- post-cycle 2 patient . - A total 194 patient enrol protocol .</detailed_description>
