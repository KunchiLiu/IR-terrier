	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study autism spectrum disorder interested develop collection research sample child autism healthy individual , may relate child autism . - The genetic condition tuberous sclerosis , cause growth benign tumor brain part body , also link autism . Researchers able determine specific genetic mutation involve tuberous sclerosis , result interested study genetic information child tuberous sclerosis autism , well tuberous sclerosis without autism . Objectives : - To develop collection DNA sample blood skin sample take child autism and/or tuberous sclerosis , well healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Children 4 18 year age autism and/or tuberous sclerosis , healthy volunteer . - Some healthy volunteer sibling child autism . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical examination , may also genetic evaluation . - Participants provide blood sample skin biopsy study . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies Autistic Patients : Gene Networks Clinical Subtypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim protocol provide elucidation clinical phenotype autism , second characterize potential cellular phenotype re-programming fibroblast induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPS cell ) . The scope autistic spectrum disorder ( ASD ) define behavioral symptom , encompass group condition include Asperger disorder , autism pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specify ( PDD ) . The clinical presentation diagnostic group differs slightly , share three common feature : deficit social reciprocity , delay deficit communication ( verbal non-verbal ) presence repetitive behavior fixate interest . These symptom pronounce autism group , serve subject pilot investigation . Individual difference behavioral symptom , genetic abnormality , medical comorbidities risk factor assess . These approach couple computational approach identify neural network analysis gene association study data , analysis gene database relate diagnostic criterion autism unbiased analysis ontology gene relevant CNS function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Autism Groups : Meeting criterion diagnosis autism , base Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , well clinical judgment . Health Sibling Typically Developing Group : Within 1.5 standard deviation mean cognitive test perform , low cutoff score Autism Diagnostic Interview Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , meeting criterion psychiatric disorder interview questionnaire . Tuberous Sclerosis Groups : Confirmed diagnosis Tuberous Sclerosis EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Autism Groups : Nonidiopathic autism ( e.g . previously identify genetic abnormality associate autism individual ) Typically Developing Group : History receive diagnosis service psychiatric significant learning issue</criteria>
