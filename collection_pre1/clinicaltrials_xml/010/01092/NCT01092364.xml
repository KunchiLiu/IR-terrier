	<detailed_description>Trials middle age adult indicate weight loss achieve sustained frequent contact long period time , frequent self-monitoring , social support motivational counseling . However , unclear whether strategy would work young adult . Based life stage , cultural context , environmental circumstance , marketing pressure , behavioral intervention may need substantially modify effective young adult . Even adaptation require intervention effective young adult racial/ethnic minority group . The propose intervention build prior evidence innovation direct increase effectiveness young adult . Using cell phone deliver weight control intervention age group potential engaging , enjoyable , practical , cost-effective , sustainable , broadly disseminate . We propose trial highly innovative risky intervention base almost entirely use cell phone technology second incremental innovation traditional behavioral intervention compare usual care control group . We recruit diverse target population overweight/obese , generally healthy young adult , comprise approximately 35 % non-Latino Whites , 35 % non-Latino Blacks , 30 % Latinos , randomize : 1 ) Usual care control : Educational material information behavioral intervention ; 2 ) Cell-phone intervention : similar education knowledge control group , thereafter behavioral intervention deliver almost exclusively via cell phone , particularly use self-monitoring social networking feature technology ; 3 ) Personal contact cell-phone enhancement : personal contact intervention enhance cell-phone self-monitoring . The post-randomization intervention period last 24 month . The primary outcome change weight 12 month post-randomization ; important secondary outcome weight change 24 month . The formative phase focus largely technology/intervention development . To assess maintenance weight loss , completion primary outcome assessment ( 24 month post-randomization ) , participant control group follow observationally ; cell-phone personal coaching intervention re-randomized either continue intervention stop intervention observational follow-up . All participant agree participate maintenance phase follow additional 2-3 year data collection every 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
