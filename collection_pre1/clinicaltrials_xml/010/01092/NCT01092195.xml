	<brief_summary>Background : - Gardasil , recently approve vaccine sexually transmit human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , provide immunity four type HPV associate genital wart cervical , vaginal , vulvar precancer cancer . The vaccine show highly effective prevent infection HPV type approve use Food Drug Administration . - More research need vaccine ability induce immunity individual suppress immune system , kinds cancer treatment stem cell transplant . Genital wart , precancer , cancer report late complication stem cell transplant . Researchers interested determine whether HPV vaccine safe give able induce immunity female stem cell transplant recipient , female donor , healthy female volunteer . Objectives : - To assess safety immune response HPV vaccine female recipient stem cell transplant either stable dos immunosuppression . Eligibility : - Females 18 50 year age allogenic stem cell transplant . - Healthy female volunteer , include stem cell donor , also eligible study . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , blood urine test , saliva sample , ask complete sexual quality life questionnaire . - Sexually active participant also routine gynecologic evaluation . - Participants receive three HPV vaccination accord standard vaccination schedule ( second third follow 2 6 month first ) . Participants record daily temperature reaction vaccine vaccine report card 1 week vaccination . - Participants clinic visit test 2 , 6 , 7 , 12 month receive first HPV vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Safety Immunogenicity Gardasil Vaccination Post Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With Without Immunosuppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HPV associate genital dysplasia complication follow hematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . In recent study institution , one third female transplant recipient HPV relate genital tract dysplasia . The quadrivalent human papillomavirus virus ( HPV ) ( type 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 ) vaccine ( Gardasil ) approve use female age 9-26 prevention cervical cancer , recently , vulvar vaginal cancer . In study , Gardasil use female age 18 year 50 least 90 day post stem cell transplant two study cohort determine safety immunogenicity population , first step reduce post-transplant HPV-related co-morbidity , genital dysplasia malignancy . The two study cohort post transplant ; one immunosuppression ( n=24 ) , one immunosuppression ( n=24 ) . Gardasil administer use FDA approve regimen 3 separate 0.5ml intramuscular injection 0 , 2 , 6 month . The primary objective study determine safety immunogenicity Gardasil female allogeneic HSCT recipient . A cohort healthy subject also vaccinate ( n=24 ) serve control . Immunogenicity study characterize CD4 CD8 T- cell response , change antibody titer cytokine response baseline month seven twelve compare three cohort . Additionally , genital exam perform monitor HPV . Secondary endpoint characterize sexual function post-transplant vulvar/vaginal graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . When available , healthy female stem cell donor correspond enrolled vaccine recipient enrol ( n=10 ) part healthy cohort vaccinate determine whether difference HPV vaccine immunogenicity subset donor respective allogeneic , HSCT female recipient . As stem cell transplant become applicable general population newer transplant technique allow large donor pool survival improve , problem associate long term survivorship genital dysplasia , become prevalent . Vaccine therapy prevent eradicate disease need .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Female stem cell transplant recipient least 90 day post stem cell transplant OR Female stem cell transplant recipient least 90 day post HSCT immunosuppression OR The matched female stem cell transplant donor include stem cell transplant recipient OR Healthy female subject Age great equal 18 year less equal 50 year EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Vaccine Recipient : Obvious HPV condyloma obvious severe dysplasia ( great equal CIN II ) warrant treatment History severe adverse reaction component ( yeast , egg , monosodium glutamate neomycin ) quadrivalent HPV vaccine .
