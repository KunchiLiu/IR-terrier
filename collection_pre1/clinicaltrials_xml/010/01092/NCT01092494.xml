	<brief_summary>Ovarian endometriotic cyst ( endometrioma ) one common endometriotic lesion , conservative laparoscopic surgery treatment choice . However , recurrence surgery common . As repetitive surgery lead morbidity ovarian function decrease , recurrence surgery frustrate patient clinician . In aspect , medical treatment offer surgery prevent delay recurrence . Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) frequently use woman advance endometriosis , efficacy rather controversial . On hand , demonstrate oral contraceptive ( OCs ) could reduce delay endometrioma recurrence , data still limit . Consequently , one type postoperative medical therapy show superior reduce recurrence endometrioma . The rationale postoperative medical therapy could eradicate microscopic lesion find treat sufficiently surgery . Therefore , maintenance strongly suppress condition induce postoperative GnRHa treatment addition OCs could promise treatment prevent recurrence , widely investigate . We perform retrospective cohort study evaluate efficacy cyclic monophasic low-dose OCs maintenance therapy GnRHa treatment suppression endometrioma recurrence .</brief_summary>
