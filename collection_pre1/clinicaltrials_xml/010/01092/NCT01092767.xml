	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Valiant stent graft safe effective treating patient blunt thoracic aortic injury ( BTAI ) . BTAI aorta injure due traumatic force chest area . It commonly cause motor vehicle accident . In case life threaten standard treatment surgery . Many time person BTAI also injuries affect result surgery . Since stent graft effective way treat aortic condition aneurysms ( bulge aorta wall ) , believe Valiant stent graft would effective treat BTAI . A stent graft woven polyester tube ( graft ) support metal frame strong flexible nitinol ( type metal ) spring ( stent ) place aorta help seal injury keep bleeding .</brief_summary>
