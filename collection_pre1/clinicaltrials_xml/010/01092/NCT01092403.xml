Male subject must ensure female partner willing use adequate contraception ; Diagnosis mild allergic asthma meet follow criterion : Stable inhaled shortacting beta2agonists p.r.n . medication asthma . Presence early asthmatic response ( EAR ) ( least 20 % fall FEV1 within 3 hour allergen inhalation ) late asthmatic response ( LAR ) ( least 15 % fall FEV1 ) . Baseline methacholine ( PC20 ) ≤ 16 mg/mL .
