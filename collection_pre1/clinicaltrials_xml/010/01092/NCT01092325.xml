	<detailed_description>This Phase I/IIa Dose-Escalation , First exposure Humans , Study Evaluating Safety Tolerability CXL-1020 Specific Effects Electrocardiographic Non-Invasive Hemodynamic Parameters Patients Chronic Heart Failure . 4 weekly four-hour treatment involve ascend dosage CXL-1020 randomly intersperse placebo dose within two unique patient cohort . Separate echocardiography cohort ( Echo Cohort A Echo Cohort B ) evaluate sustain dose 4 hour ( ECHO A ) , ascend two dose level , 4-hour infusion ( 2 hour ) ( ECHO B ) , individual patient . Echo Cohort dosage determine response observe previous cohort exposure .</detailed_description>
