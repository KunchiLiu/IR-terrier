	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Dasatinib design change function gene . By change function gene , may prevent cancer grow spread . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , place one two group depend disease remove surgery . Group 1 patient melanoma remove surgery . Group 2 patient melanoma completely remove surgery . Study Drug Administration : For study , every 4 week study `` cycle . '' Dasatinib pills take mouth full glass ( 8 ounce ) water without meal . The pill crush cut , swallow whole . If Group 1 , take 2 dasatinib pill 1 time every day , 7 day already-scheduled surgery . About 6 week surgery ( depend long take recover ) begin take 2 dasatinib pill 1 time every day 13 cycle long tolerate disease come back . If Group 2 , take 2 dasatinib pill 1 time every day , 7 day already-scheduled biopsy Day 8 ( +/1 business day ) Cycle 1 . Within 5 day biopsy , begin take 2 dasatinib pill 1 time every day 13 cycle , long tolerate disease come back . Both group give pill chart fill home record take study drug , many pill take time . You need bring pill chart every study visit study doctor review . You also need bring pill bottle study visit . Group 1 Study Visits : After screen test complete , start take study drug , follow procedure perform : - Your weight vital sign measure . - You ask drug may take . - Your performance status record . After 7 day take study drug , surgery , follow procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take . - You ECG check heart function . - You PET scan check status disease . About 6 week surgery , begin take study drug Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform Day 1 cycle : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take , side effect may experience . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take , side effect may experience . Every 12 week receive treatment , follow test procedure perform : - An ECG perform check heart function . - You CT scan MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Group 2 Study Visits : After screen test complete , start take study drug , follow procedure perform : - You measurement vital sign include weight . - You ask drug may take . - Your performance status record . After 7 day take study drug , biopsy , follow procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take . - You ECG check heart function . - You PET scan check status disease . About 5 day biopsy , begin take study drug 3 week complete Cycle 1 . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take , side effect may experience . The following test procedure perform Day 1 cycle start Cycle 2 : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take , side effect may experience . Every 12 week receive treatment , follow test procedure perform : - An ECG perform check heart function . - You CT scan MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Length Study : You continue take study drug 13 cycle . You take study early experience intolerable side effect , disease return ( Group 1 ) , disease get bad ( Group 2 ) , study doctor think best interest . If Group 2 , benefit treatment , may allow continue receive treatment study drug complete 12 study cycle . The study doctor discus option detail . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - An ECG perform check heart function . - You CT scan MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis perform check status disease . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take , side effect may experience . Follow-Up Visits : After participation study complete , follow-up visit every 3 month ask health status . If come hospital regularly schedule clinic visit , receive follow-up phone call . The phone call last 15 minute time . This investigational study . Dasatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type leukemia . The use dasatinib treat acral lentiginous melanoma , mucosal melanoma , chronic sun-damaged melanoma investigational .</detailed_description>
