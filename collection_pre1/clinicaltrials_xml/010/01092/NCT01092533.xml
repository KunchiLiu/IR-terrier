	<brief_summary>The objective clinical trial evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium ( Myfortic® ) combination low-dose corticosteroid ( Decortin H® ) compare monotherapy low-dose corticosteroid ( Decortin H® ) subject chronic intraocular inflammation ( non-infectious intermediate uveitis ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myfortic Treatment Non-infectious Intermediate Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , pro-drug contain mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) active agent , approve treatment acute graft rejection kidney- , heart- liver-transplantation , show 1995 effective inhibit development experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis . Further study prove safe effective steroid-sparing immunomodulatory reduce recurrence rate non-infectious intermediate uveitis human . Although adverse effect profile MMF comparatively benign , gastrointestinal adverse effect major concern may limit clinical benefit , may necessitate dose reduction , interruption , even discontinuation MMF . An enteric-coated formulation mycophenolate sodium ( EC-MPS , Myfortic ) develop especially reduce MPA-related gastrointestinal adverse event . This clinical trial prospective control study evaluate whether Myfortic base regimen able reduce probability relapse compare steroid therapy alone test whether Myfortic base therapy provide superior behaviour compare steroid regimen .</detailed_description>
