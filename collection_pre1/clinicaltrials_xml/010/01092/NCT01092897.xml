	<detailed_description>We hypothesize bone marrow progenitor cell mobilize circulation PAH , home lung differentiate mast cell , promote vascular remodel vasoconstriction release renin chymase . As corollary , hypothesize anti cKit tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , imatinib , provide clinical benefit patient inhibition mast cell progenitor proliferation , mobilization differentiation . To test , determine mast cell progenitor mast cell biomarkers related imatinib clinical response . This ancillary study , part placebo-controlled , double-blind multi center clinical trial imatinib pulmonary arterial hypertension .</detailed_description>
