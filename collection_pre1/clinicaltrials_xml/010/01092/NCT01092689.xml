These subject ingest low dose radiolabeled PhIP , meat-derived carcinogen , small amount resect tissue ( waste ) analyze highly sensitive technology determine carcinogen bind DNA pancreas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Meat-borne Carcinogens Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer rapidly fatal case little known cause . Identifying modify risk factor reduce mortality prevention . Carcinogens form meat cook high temperature may modifiable risk factor pancreatic cancer , direct evidence need demonstrate involvement pancreas tissue . We propose recruit subject schedule pancreatectomy treatment pancreatic cancer . These subject ingest low dose radiolabeled PhIP , meat-derived carcinogen , small amount resect tissue ( waste ) analyze highly sensitive technology determine carcinogen bind DNA pancreas . We hypothesize meat-derived carcinogen bind DNA pancreas . The amount PhIP ingest equivalent amount two well-done barbecue chicken breast dose radioactivity comparable typical chest x-ray . This research increase understand pancreatic carcinogenesis , facilitate design prevention strategy .</detailed_description>
