	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory failure heterogeneous disorder result 300,000 Americans require admission intensive care unit invasive mechanical ventilatory support year . Though acute respiratory failure pulmonary disorder , patient survive hospitalization limited respiratory symptom discharge . Rather persistent neuromuscular weakness primary disorder adversely alter quality life ability function daily basis . In application plan conduct randomize clinical trial call Do It Now study ( Diagnosis Treatment Neuromuscular Weakness ) determine effectiveness intensive physical therapy program patient recover acute respiratory failure . This trial establish efficacy physical therapy program currently perform patient acute respiratory failure non-evidence base manner across United States .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory failure heterogeneous disorder result 300,000 Americans require admission intensive care unit invasive mechanical ventilatory support year . Though acute respiratory failure pulmonary disorder , patient survive limited respiratory symptom discharge . Rather persistent neuromuscular weakness primary disorder adversely affect quality life ability function daily basis . Weakness survivor relate development critical illness polyneuromyopathy ( CIPNM ) . Presently , therapy treat estimate 110,000 acute respiratory failure survivor develop CIPNM year . Based result national survey physical therapist intensive care physician , utilization type physical therapy patient recover acute respiratory failure neuromuscular weakness varies significantly depend type hospital primary diagnosis patient . We plan perform randomized clinical trial determine effectiveness intensive four week physical therapy program patient acute respiratory failure . This trial determine efficacy physical therapy program currently perform non-evidence base manner patient acute respiratory failure across United States . If successful , study pave way large multi-center clinical trial intensive physical therapy survivor acute respiratory failure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Acute respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation least four day . Recent myocardial infarction within last 3 week , presence sign symptom unstable angina history unstable arrhythmia include ventricular tachycardia atrial fibrillation ( HR &gt; 100 bpm ) . Recent history pulmonary embolism within last six week . History severe aortic stenosis . Presence dissect aortic aneurysm . Significant language barrier would limit ability participate physical therapy program . Patients live great 45 mile University Colorado Hospital . Underlying disorder make unlikely patient survive 6 month . Severe physical cognitive impairment would impair ability exercise .</criteria>
