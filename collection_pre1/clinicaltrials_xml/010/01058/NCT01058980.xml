	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common heart rhythm disorder , impair quality life increase stroke risk mortality . Despite advance medical treatment , AF remain uncontrolled many patient . In many patient , AF initiate abnormal electrical impulse pulmonary vein . A catheter ablation procedure call pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) therefore develop , use heat isolate PV foci heart . PVI effective , must repeat 50 % case foci isolation permanent initial PVI . The intravenous administration drug call adenosine PVI procedure unmask residual conduction would otherwise remain unnoticed , so-called `` dormant conduction '' . In experience , additional ablation guide adenosine reduces AF recurrence need repeat PVI procedure . However , adenosine-guided approach yet proven standard therapy . The present study , conduct 15 clinical centre Canada , Europe Australia therefore intend evaluate efficacy adenosine-guided ablation prevent AF recurrence . Five hundred twenty-six patient include study , complete within 2 year . In patient , presence dormant conduction test adenosine PVI . If dormant conduction observe , additional ablation perform half patient select randomly . If dormant conduction , randomly select patient follow registry . If adenosine-guided approach demonstrate improve success rate PVI procedures , become standard approach `` permanent cure '' AF , therefore benefit patient reduce arrhythmia recurrence , hospitalization need repeat intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADenosine Following Pulmonary Vein Isolation Target Dormant Conduction Elimination : ADVICE Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , frequently treat cardiac arrhythmia , impair quality life increase stroke risk mortality . Despite advance antiarrhythmic drug therapy , AF remain uncontrolled many patient . More effective measure prevent , treat potentially cure AF need . Ectopic foci originate pulmonary vein ( PVs ) initiate AF many patient . PV isolation ( PVI ) , PV conduction eliminate catheter ablation , emerge effective treatment select patient . However AF recur 50 % , due recovery PV conduction . Dormant PV conduction ( PV conduction suppress time PVI subsequent recovery ) propose explain recurrence . We demonstrate adenosine restore conduction viable PVs attempt PVI activate outward K+-currents , lead selective hyperpolarization PV cardiomyocytes removal voltage-dependent Na+-channel inactivation . Thus , adenosine use differentiate permanent PV-atrial block dormant PV conduction identify need additional ablation . We recently perform pilot study 47 patient , adenosine use guide additional ablation . Results compare 47 historical control . Dormant conduction observe 55 % patient undergoing PVI additional adenosine-guided ablation decrease AF recurrence rate 49 % 21 % . An adequately-powered prospective randomize control clinical trial require confirm finding . The primary objective propose ADVICE trial evaluate impact adenosine-guided PVI prevent AF recurrence among patient paroxysmal AF . We hypothesize PVI ablation strategy incorporate elimination dormant conduction unmask intravenous adenosine decrease symptomatic AF recurrence compare standard PVI , without incur significant additional risk . This prospective randomized study conduct 15 clinical center Canada , Europe Australia . Patients paroxysmal AF refer PVI recruit . Standard PVI perform patient elimination PV conduction . All patient subsequently receive intravenous adenosine attempt unmask dormant conduction . If dormant conduction elicit , patient randomize ablation ( Group 1 ; control ) additional adenosine-guided ablation dormant conduction abolish ( Group 2 ; adenosine-guided PVI ) . If dormant conduction reveal , randomly select patient follow registry assess role dormant conduction predictor AF recurrence . Portable electrocardiographic monitor provide patient . The primary outcome time first document symptomatic AF episode post-PVI base intention-to-treat analysis . Since symptomatic AF recurrence anticipate 45 % control , 210 patient dormant conduction require order able detect difference 20 % , power least 85 % . Assuming presence dormant conduction minimum 40 % patient standard PVI , 526 patient enrol study . Enrolment expect complete within 12 month , patient follow 12 month . Demonstrated superiority adenosine-guided PVI ablation strategy would represent major advancement refine interventional approach AF . The ADVICE trial carry potential , therefore , alter standard care benefit patient AF reduce arrhythmia recurrence , hospitalization need repeat intervention</detailed_description>
