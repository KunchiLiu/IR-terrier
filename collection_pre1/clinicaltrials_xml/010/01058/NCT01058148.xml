	<brief_summary>Background : - The Mississippi Delta ( include county along Mississippi River ) one poor area United States . Women live Mississippi Delta disproportionately high rate cervical cancer , unlikely come clinic except perhaps give birth , year diagnose cancer . - To improve rate screen , researcher attempt outreach study see whether under-screened woman , approach door-to-door recruitment , would get screened one two method ( home-based self-collection testing , clinic exam ) method would prefer . Objectives : - To assess/measure increased participation under-screened woman live Mississippi Delta cervical cancer screen offer woman opportunity get screen one two possible community outreach-based cervical cancer screen modality , self-collection HPV test clinic-based cytology screening , current standard care . Eligibility : - Women 26 65 year age , pregnant currently past 8 week , intact cervix , history cancer , screen cervical cancer past 3 year . Design : - Researchers recruit participant door-to-door basis . Researchers recruit eligible woman within household . Recruitment do daylight hour end work day maximize chance find woman home . - Eligible woman willing participate complete questionnaire demographic medical information . - Participants ask choose screen method preference . If choose self-collection HPV testing , give self-collection kit ask perform self-collection return kit within 1 month . Participants choose cytology screen provide phone number location local health department clinic encourage schedule screen within follow month . - Women complete participation within 1 month consider noncompliant choose intervention . Researchers re-contact noncompliant woman offer participation study , include permit refuse participate choose alternative intervention ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Study Two Community Outreach-Based Approaches Increase Participation Women Living Mississippi Delta Cervical Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct study self-collected cervicovaginal specimen carcinogenic human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA test cervical cancer screen woman live Mississippi Delta , disproportionately high rate cervical cancer . To date , note high level participation well high percentage completion return home self-collection . Although recruited under-screened woman study , clinic-based ( i.e. , under-screened woman still require come health department clinic ) , use Mississippi State Department Health district clinic . In reality , woman get cervical cancer Mississippi Delta unlikely come clinic except perhaps give birth , year diagnose cancer . Thus , ancillary study work Mississippi , propose outreach study determine whether under-screened woman , approach via door-to-door recruitment , would participate ( get screen ) one two community outreach-based cervical cancer screen modality , home-based self-collection HPV test clinic-based cytology screening , two modality prefer . We recruit door-to-door 400 under-screened , eligible woman age 26-65 year live Mississippi Delta . Consenting , eligible woman give choice take use self-collection kit come local Health Department clinic cervical cytology screen . Under assumption 5 % under-screened population would choose undergo screen without intervention , recruitment 400 woman study permit u detect 2-fold increase participation screen ( define complete screen ) 90 % power ( alpha = 0.05 ) . In scenario , able detect 90 % power ( alpha = 0.05 ) 25 % preference one screening method ( 75 % vs. 50 % ( preference ) ) .</detailed_description>
