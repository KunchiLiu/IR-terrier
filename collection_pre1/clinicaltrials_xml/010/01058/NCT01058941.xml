	<detailed_description>Current pharmacological agent AD impact disease prevalence limit effect improve clinical course AD . The exponential rise prevalence , incidence , cost care AD make find therapeutic agent either prevent AD delay disease progression urgent health care need . Since inflammation , lipid dysregulation , insulin resistance associate AD pathology , combination lipoic acid plus fish oil potential maximize therapeutic benefit act three mechanism associate disease pathology . Our primary study aim evaluate ability lipoic acid plus omega-3 fatty acid delay cognitive functional decline people AD . The investigator also evaluate effect lipoic acid plus omega-3 fatty acid change serum plasma biomarkers 18 month determine marker associate whole brain atrophy ( MRI volume change ) clinical outcome ( ADAS-cog , ADL ) . The association identify aid identification specific biomarkers may use evaluate treatment effect future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
