	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Dose Finding Safety RVX000222 Subjects With Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-third US population , almost 80 million adult , cardiovascular disease mortality associate heart disease still remain leading cause death around world . The major risk factor cardiovascular disease associate atherosclerosis dyslipidemia , characterize high level low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and/or low level high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) . The widespread use statins patient risk cardiovascular disease lead low LDL level little effect HDL level . HDL well establish role atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease protection . HDL mediate removal cholesterol atherosclerotic plaque elimination body . The cardioprotective component HDL consist apolipoprotein A1 ( ApoA1 ) . Recent intervention study synthetic HDL particle recombinant ApoA1 show HDL capacity reverse coronary atherosclerosis . Increasing ApoA1 likely favorable effect atherosclerotic plaque size stability , cardiovascular disease . RVX000222 member novel class small molecule candidate treatment dyslipidemia increase plasma level HDL increase ApoA1 transcription .</detailed_description>
