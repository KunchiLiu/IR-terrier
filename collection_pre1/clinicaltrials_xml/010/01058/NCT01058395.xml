	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To assess safety feasibility minocycline administration TBI dose escalation study two different dos 7 day . 2 . To assess pharmacokinetic characteristic two different dose regimen minocycline TBI patient , effect biochemical marker neuroprotective mechanism , effect neurobehavioral functional outcome . 3 . To begin initial assessment efficacy minocycline therapeutic agent severe human TBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose preliminary study test hypothesis administration minocycline human moderate severe TBI safe feasible acute post-injury setting , characterize disposition effect biomarkers traumatic CNS injury Phase IIa trial . The data collect serve basis large Phase IIb clinical trial randomize placebo-controlled parallel group design , investigate potential safety efficacy therapeutic agent severe human TBI . Tetracycline derivative , include doxycycline minocycline , show neuroprotective give traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) ischemia rodent . In particular , reduced lesion volume improve neurological outcome demonstrate follow minocycline treatment TBI . The propose mechanism observation multifactorial , include inhibition microglial activation , caspase-mediated apoptosis , excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA ) pathway . Because comparable inflammatory , excitotoxic apoptotic pathway also implicate human TBI , hypothesize administration minocycline confer neuroprotection moderate severe TBI milieu well , potential significant clinical benefit . Minocycline highly lipophilic , thus penetrate human central nervous system ( CNS ) . In addition , show safe use non-traumatic human neurological disorder .</detailed_description>
