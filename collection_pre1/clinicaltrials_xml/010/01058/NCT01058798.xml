	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma ( NB ) common malignant tumor infancy . Approximately 60 % NB patient clinically diagnose stage IV disease poor prognosis 5-year survival rate 30 % . The mechanism underlie tumorigenesis NB remain largely unclear . It suggest pathogenesis NB due failure differentiation apoptosis embryonic NB cell . Well-regulated glycosylation essential normal development nervous system . Altered expression glycosyltransferases result dysregulated glycosylation neuroblastic cell might lead development NB . The β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase III ( B4GALNT3 ) exhibit GalNAc transferase activity form GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc ( LacdiNAc LDN ) structure . The Drosophila B4GALNTA , homolog human B4GALNT3 , suggest regulate neuronal development . By immunohistochemical study , demonstrate expression B4GALNT3 correlate well histological grade differentiation 87 NB tumor sample . In addition , positive B4GALNT3 expression predict favorable patient 's outcome . These evidence suggest regulation glycosyltransferases critical development NB . To explore role glycosyltransferases differentiation development NB , propose 3-year project follow 3 major aim : Aim Ⅰ : Clarifying effect B4GALNT3 NB cell behavior vitro vivo . For understanding effect B4GALNT3 NB cell , NB cell stable overexpression B4GALNT3 select . Then NB cell phenotype behavior change overexpression B4GALNT3 evaluate vitro assay well nude mouse xenograft model . In addition , expression B4GALNT3 suppress siRNA , response NB cell ATRA-induced differentiation evaluate . Aim Ⅱ : Clarifying target protein glycosylated B4GALNT3 well associate downstream pathway vitro vivo . The possible protein glycosylated B4GALNT3 evaluate compare differential protein expression B4GALNT3-transfected mock-transfected NB cell use proteomics analysis . NB tumor sample low high B4GALNT3 expression level also subject proteomics analysis explore possible target protein glycosylated B4GALNT3 vivo . After identify target protein modify B4GALNT3 , downstream pathway affect NB cell differentiation also evaluate . Aim Ⅲ : Clarifying whether B4GALNT4 , family member B4GALNT , play similar role B4GALNT3 , well expression enzyme control epigenetically human NB cell line tumor sample . The expression level B4GALNT4 human NB sample evaluate RT-PCR immunohistochemistry . The methylation status promoter sit B4GALNT3 B4GALNT4 examine various NB cell line well tumor sample . Furthermore , NB tumor sample exhibit high low B4GALNT level subject microRNA array . Altogether , study establish functional role family glycosyltransferases cell behavior NB , also illustrate expression glycosyltransferases regulate epigenetically glycosyltransferases affect NB cell behavior . Therefore , result might shed light oncogenesis NB well target therapy NB .</brief_summary>
