	<detailed_description>The use high-volume low-pressure ( HVLP ) endotracheal cuff reduce cuff-induced tracheal damage cuff conforms passively tracheal contour expand inflation cuff inflation pressure assume equal cuff-to-trachea pressure . However , longitudinal fold HVLP cuff occur inflation within trachea , diameter cuff great trachea , fold provide channel aspiration gas leakage . Silent aspiration upper airway secretion report patient undergo general anesthesia intensive care unit ( ICU ) . A previous study report 83 % aspiration subglottic dye detect bronchoscopy anesthetized patient , study intubate patient HVLP cuff ICU show 87 % aspiration rate . Intubation-related ( ventilator associate pneumonia ) pneumonia lead cause prolongation hospital stay , mortality morbidity postoperative period ICU . Therefore , important achieve good seal around cuff without tracheal damage , would reduce incidence pneumonia intubate patient . A previous benchtop study demonstrate leak around cuff minimize endotracheal tube size small relative size trachea . In current study , assess influence different HVLP endotracheal tube size fluid leakage around cuff benchtop model anesthetized patient .</detailed_description>
