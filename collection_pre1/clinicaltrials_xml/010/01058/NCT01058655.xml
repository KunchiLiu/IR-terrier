	<brief_summary>Research show anti-angiogenic agent effective therapy treat cancer . Anti-angiogenic agent target blood vessel require tumor grow . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) one cell pathway use blood vessel growth . When investigator interfere VEGF pathway , investigator inhibit blood vessel growth require tumor . One study drug use , tivozanib ( AV-951 ) , selectively interfere VEGF pathway . The second study drug use , everolimus ( RAD001 ) interfere mTOR pathway . The mTOR pathway another pathway involve blood vessel tumor cell growth . By combine two drug investigator hope slow reverse tumor cell growth patient whose tumor become resistant therapy disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 AV-951 Patients With Refractory , Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective Phase I - To determine safety , tolerability , maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) everolimus tivozanib administer combination patient advance gastrointestinal tumor . Phase II - At MTD , assess progression-free survival associate everolimus tivozanib patient refractory , metastatic colorectal cancer . Secondary Objectives Phase II - To assess tumor response rate . - To assess overall survival .</detailed_description>
