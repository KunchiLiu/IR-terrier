	<brief_summary>In Phase II clinical trial investigator use four human non-small cell lung cancer cell line previously establish tissue culture laboratory . The investigator gene modify tumor cell laboratory block TGF-beta secretion . The investigator inject genetically engineer cell vaccine patient stage II IV non-small cell lung cancer . Our rationale use people 's tumor cell lung tumor cell line belong different people show share common characteristic recognize non-self immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Lucanix™ Patients With Stages II-IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-stage , open-label , three-arm , Phase II study . It design evaluate efficacy immunization increase dos allogeneic tumor cell vaccine , Lucanix™ , patient non-curable NSCLC . Patients follow clinical response , immunogenicity safety . Eligible patient receive 4 monthly intradermal injection cell cocktail comprise equal number four irradiated allogeneic TGF-beta2 antisense gene modify NSCLC cell line . Patients randomize one three study cohort . Patients receive 12,500,000 , 25,000,000 , 50,000,000 gene modify cell respectively . Treated patient evaluate four month enter therapy . Patients respond therapy receive additional four twelve injection evaluate whether response therapy amplify . Response , time tumor progression , tumor free survival monitor patient compare historical control patient receive form therapy . Patients monitor evaluate accord standard evaluation criterion response , stable disease , partial response complete response . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE -Evaluate ability increase dos Lucanix™ , gene-modified tumor cell vaccine , induce tumor response patient non-curable NSCLC SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - Evaluate ability Lucanix™ vaccination regimen induce immune response ( cellular humoral ) - Estimate response duration Lucanix™ regimen - Evaluate effect repeat inoculation immune infiltrate - Evaluate safety Lucanix™ regimen INCLUSION CRITERIA - Signed informed consent - 18 year - Histologically confirm non-curable NSCLC estimate total tumor burden volume less equal 125 cc , confirm stage II , III , IV . - Must complete refuse conventional therapy - Performance status ( ECOG ) less 2 . - Absolute granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm3 - Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 - Total Bilirubin le equal 2 mg/dL - AST ALT less equal 2x Upper Limit Normal - Creatinine le equal 1.5 mg/dL EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Concurrent systemic steroid great 2 mg prednisone/day - Prior splenectomy - Any surgery involve general anesthesia , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , steroid therapy immunotherapy le 4 week study entry - Brain metastasis meningeal lymphomatosis unless treat stable great equal 2 month - Known HIV positive - Serious non-malignant disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , active uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection ) , condition , opinion investigator would compromise protocol objective . - Prior malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma carcinomas skin ) unless remission great equal 2 year - Treatment investigational drug within 30 day prior study entry - History psychiatric disorder would impede adherence protocol - Pregnant nursing woman refusal practice contraception reproductive potential</detailed_description>
