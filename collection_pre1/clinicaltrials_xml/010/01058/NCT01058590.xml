	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common disorder child ( 2-3 % ) . OSAS turn , associate significant behavioral , learning , heart problem . Adenotonsillectomy ( T &amp; A , mean removal tonsil adenoid ) common treatment problem .Diagnosis OSAS child base overnight polysomnography ( sleep study ) . Recent study suggest upper airway systemic inflammatory change exist school-age child adult OSAS , anti inflammatory therapy improve respiratory parameter sleep reduce adenoid size , similar surgery . However , data literature inflammatory change infant disorder . Healthcare resource utilization , sensitive marker disease consume young child ( &lt; 3y ) OSAS healthy child , first year life We hypothesize infant young child OSAS present local inflammatory change airways well systemic inflammation ( blood urine ) contribute learning , grow heart associate medical problem . The Aims present study characterize local systemic inflammatory change young child OSAS , evaluate associate medical problem diagnosis therapy ( T &amp; A ) If indeed inflammation `` responsible '' development OSAS young age reduce follow therapy ( i.e . T &amp; A ) . In case bio-markers may become part algorithms diagnosis follow patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 . To conduct trial evaluate effect Adenonsillectomy infant ( 1-36 month age ) , OSA . Outcome measure include polysomnographic finding conduct prior 12 week follow surgery . 2 . To identify presence inflammatory marker ( , Leukotriene B4 , Leukotriene C4/D4/E4 , Isoprostane-8 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , pro inflammatory cytokine ) peripheral blood ( prior therapy ) , urine ( Leukotriene E-4 , others ) correlate local systemic expression prior therapy magnitude therapy-associated response . Study Duration : Two year ( initial recruitment complete within initial 12 month study ) . Assessment sample obtain throughout study do latter part study . Setting : Soroka University Hospital . The Sleep Laboratory Soroka UMC , pediatric one city Beer Sheva surroundings , evaluate 1,000 children/year variety sleep disorder , among &gt; 700 refer suspect OSAS , among 100 infant &lt; 2 years/ year . All child refer surgery admit Dept . Pediatrics PI work . We intend approach child prior surgery offer participate study . Those interested gain sleep study follow surgery validate ( rull ) presence residual OSA need , continue follow pediatric sleep outpatient clinic Soroka UMC .</detailed_description>
