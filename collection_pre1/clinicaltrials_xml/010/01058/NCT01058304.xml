	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common health problem lead cause disability among veteran . Physical therapy ( PT ) ongoing exercise associate reduce pain improved physical function among patient knee OA , yet majority veteran OA physically inactive . Furthermore , PT service limit resource VA health care system , demand exceed supply . VA patient knee OA generally receive one two PT visit . Prior research indicate amount clinical contact time sufficient provide patient assessment , instruction , support need adopt maintain exercise program , particularly context chronic pain condition . Therefore development , test , implementation mechanism cost-effectively expand PT service knee OA may play key role improve pain outcome large group veteran . This research examine group-based approach deliver PT knee OA , extend service veteran , great number session per veteran , low staffing cost . The objective study compare effectiveness group-based PT program knee OA usual individual PT care knee OA . This study randomize control trial 12-week , group-based PT program among N=320 veteran symptomatic knee OA Durham VA Medical Center ( VAMC ) . Participants randomly assign group-based PT program individual PT ( usual care ) . The group PT arm include 6 1-hour visit ( every week ) lead physical therapist exercise physiologist physical therapy assistant , 8 participant per group . The individual PT arm , model typical PT care knee OA Durham VAMC health care setting , include 2 1-hour visit physical therapist , 2-3 week apart . The group PT session include group instruction joint care ( activity pace joint projection ) , group discussion exercise successes barrier , group exercise , schedule individual consultation physical therapist ( 2 per participant , 15-20 minute ) address specific functional therapeutic need . While individual PT session differ structure , include informational , assessment , therapeutic content group session . Both group give instruction home exercise program . The primary outcome study Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) . The secondary outcome objectively assess physical function ( Short Physical Performance Test Protocol ) . These outcome assess baseline 12-week follow-up . The WOMAC also assess via telephone 24-week follow-up examine whether observe intervention effect maintain . Mixed linear model use compare outcomes two study arm . We also conduct economic analysis group-based PT program .</detailed_description>
