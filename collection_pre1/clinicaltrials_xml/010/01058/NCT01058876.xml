	<brief_summary>The investigator ' general hypothesis African-Americans ( AAs ) smoke positive reinforcement nicotine `` peak-seeking '' pattern smoking ( smoke individual cigarette intensively great intake nicotine tobacco smoke toxin ) , white smoke negative reinforcement `` trough-maintaining '' pattern ( avoid withdrawal maintain consistent nicotine level throughout day mean regular smoke pattern ) . We , investigator , believe pattern link identifiable racial difference nicotine pharmacology . For study hypothesize AAs behave like nicotine `` peak-seeker '' white behave like nicotine `` trough-maintainers '' , AAs respond switch regular low nicotine yield commercial cigarette smoke cigarette relatively intensively relatively small increase daily cigarette consumption ( cigarette per day CPD ) compare white .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Low Yield Cigarettes African Americans v . Whites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several line evidence indicate AAs highly addict cigarette smoking white . AAs likely smoke first cigarette within 10 minute awaken , indicator severity dependence . They likely want quit smoking likely try quit ( attempts last least 24 hour , significantly less likely white successful abstainer one year . The quit ratio ( former smokers/ever smoker ) recently report 37.3 % AAs compare 51 % white ( 2 ) . NICOTINE REGULATION IN AAS AND WHITES : In general smoker regulate ( titrate ) smoke take amount nicotine day day . This behavior well demonstrated study smoker smoke commercial cigarette differ yield , show smoker take similar amount nicotine high- low-yield cigarette . NCI MONOGRAPH 13 summarize data nicotine low yield cigarette conclude low yield cigarette present health risk high yield cigarette ( 12 ) . However , research nicotine titration appear do primarily white smoker . We believe nicotine titration pattern differ AAs compare white , base hypothesis AAs smoke positive reinforcing effect individual cigarette , white smoke maintain consistent level nicotine . We predict response switch regular low yield cigarette AAs differ try take nicotine per cigarette smoking intensively , less likely try regulate total daily intake nicotine compare white . Melanin : A recent study ( 14 ) show level facultative melanin ( include genetically exposure influence melanin ) skin significantly positively related cigarette per day , Fagerstrom score , cotinine level . By measure melanin level study subject , able determine relationship melanin level nicotine pharmacokinetics . This non-randomized , non-blinded , two treatment arm crossover study oral nicotine cotinine pharmacokinetic study . Cigarettes supply treatment arm subject smoke ad libitum . During first arm , subject smoke `` usual '' cigarette also undergo oral pharmacokinetics protocol . During second arm , subject smoke commercial cigarette machine-determined nicotine yield approximately 50 % `` usual '' brand . Blood urine sample collect throughout study analyze usual method .</detailed_description>
