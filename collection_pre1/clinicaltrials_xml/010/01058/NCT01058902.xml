	<brief_summary>Lung cancer common cancer western world . Only 10 15 % patient diagnosed lung cancer suitable potentially curative surgical treatment . Despite surgery , recurrence lung cancer still occur . Aspirin potentially may help increase survival alter biochemistry potential remain lung cancer cell . Most lung cancer occur smoker . Smokers increase risk heart attack stroke . Aspirin beneficial effect heart brain , potentially reduce incidence heart attack stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Of Aspirin On Survival Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design Randomised study aspirin 75mg reduce mortality patient resection non-small cell lung cancer . Patients already aspirin , unsuitable study wish partake study ask permission follow via GP National Strategic Tracking service . Methodology Initially consultant thoracic cardiothoracic surgeon UK consult obtain permission patient include study . If agree individual unit ' lung cancer nurse actually involved recruit post operative patient study . We use lung cancer nurse enter via secure electronic system patient pre operative characteristic post operative staging histology . Mortality follow via strategic trace service . Study subjects/patients All patient undergo potentially curative resection non small cell carcinoma lung . Patients recruit post operatively post operative death eliminate , histology know prior randomisation . Contamination control limb Patients aspirin limb ask 1 year , 3 year 5 year patient appointment still stake aspirin . Patients control limb ask 1 year , 3 year 5 year patient appointment start aspirin anyone . If appointment miss patient GP contact information , long patient agree u contact GP . Data collection This prospective via secure web server , host NHS computer locate secure NHS IT lock room . Study procedures No invasive procedure , sample tissue perform obtained patient . Study intervention Aspirin 75 mg/day tablet take period 5 year randomisation . Reducing adverse event All patient assess researcher eliminated patient history gastric duodenal ulcer , know allergy aspirin NSAIDs . Monitoring Adverse event All patient give business card contact number , email address web address report adverse event participate trial . In addition general practitioner patient trial notify . Specific adverse event follow include : Stopping trial medication secondary side effect , GI bleed , stomach ulcer , anaemia require hospital admission Blood transfusion ( ) Data Monitoring Committee The data management committee analyse survival data control intervention limb every 6 month 5 year regard mortality gastrointestinal side effect require hospital admission . If mortality aspirin treatment group exceed 3 Standard deviation control mortality rate trial stop immediately aspirin user contact immediately inform stop aspirin immediately . The gastrointestinal side effect aspirin widely study aspirin counter product use low dose formulation aim use gastrointestinal side effect marker stop trial . GP contact All GPs inform patient inclusion trial . Statistical analysis . This perform Dr Mark Jackson delegate member team , Liverpool Heart Chest Hospital . Sample size Based retrospective trail conduct Liverpool Heart Chest hospital . Accepting suggest hazard ratio 0.84 difference 5-year survival approximately 6 % , various power calculation perform derive estimate sample size require trial . Depending aspirin : non-aspirin ratio base standard assumption , combine total 2000 3000 patient would need recruit detect significant difference survival . Hence aim recruit 2,500 patient .</detailed_description>
