	<detailed_description>This study design demonstrate ability inoculate malaria naive human volunteer Plasmodium falciparum strain malaria sporozoites bite infect mosquito control condition . Subjects monitor closely development malaria treat standard dos anti-malarial medication Plasmodium falciparum strain malaria know sensitive . Study participant undergo malaria sporozoite challenge wild-type NF54 strain Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite administer via bite five infected Anopheles stephensi mosquito control containment condition . Participants closely monitor acute reactogenicity sign and/or symptom malaria infection , day five post-challenge , daily blood film examine presence malaria parasite . Participants develop malaria infection treat standard oral regimen chloroquine , FDA-approved anti-malarial drug , direct observation . Participants treat upon first evidence microscopic parasitemia day 18 remain negative . Participants house study staff local hotel close observation day 9 post-challenge , three consecutive blood smear negative symptom resolve , follow weekly total 8 week . Follow-up safety conduct 4- 6- month post-challenge .</detailed_description>
