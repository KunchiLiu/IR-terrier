	<brief_summary>Study outline : Deferasirox ( Exjade® ) regularly use severe iron overload order avoid organ damage liver , heart organ . It propose , iron overload may impose damage organ also bone marrow thus worsen hematopoietic insufficiency patient MDS . Patients present low INT-1 risk MDS mild iron overload treat deferasirox study . It analyze hematological improvement observe treatment .</brief_summary>
