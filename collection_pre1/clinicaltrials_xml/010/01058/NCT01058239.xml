	<brief_summary>Post transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD ) type B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma occur patient weaken immune system due immunosuppressive medication take organ stem cell transplantation . This usually relate virus call Epstein-Barr ( EPV ) . Rituximab type drug call `` antibody '' specifically destroy normal cancerous B-cells , commonly use PTLD . Bortezomib drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat multiple myeloma B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma call Mantle Cell Lymphoma , show significant activity lymphoma cell cause EBV . In research study , hope learn addition bortezomib rituximab treatment increase rate complete remission cure PTLD organ stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Plus Rituximab EBV+ PTLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Both rituximab bortezomib give participant intravenously . Each cycle treatment consist 21 day . Rituximab give Days 1 , 8 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 subsequent cycle . Bortezomib give Days 1 , 4 , 8 11 every cycle . Participants receive maximum 4 cycle . - The following study procedure perform cycle throughout study : Medical history review ; Physical exam ; Performance Status ; Questionnaire ; Blood draw ; PET/CT scan ( After cycle 2 , 4 6 ) . - After Cycle 4 , study doctor feel participant complete response treatment , continue onto Post-Treatment Surveillance period , consist regular clinic visit two year . - However , study doctor feel participant partial response treatment may benefit continue , receive additional two cycle bortezomib give daily tablet antiviral drug valganciclovir help target EBV .</detailed_description>
