	<brief_summary>The real-time visualization needle nerve ultrasound-guided nerve block challenge . These difficulty may partly explain systemic complication local anesthetic ultrasound . Injection small amount solution around anesthetize nerve ( hydro-dissection ) propose enhance contrast outline border also improve visualization needle tip . The glucose solution 5 % solution interesting allows , unlike saline , maintain motor response neurostimulation . The hydro-dissection particularly useful one suspect hypoechoic vessel near nerve anesthetize . Thereby , nerve well demarcate separate vessel , injection local anesthetic perform circumferential diffusion space ( like small pocket ) without redirect needle . The influence hydro-dissection nerve block efficiency unknown . The nerve block quality improve entire anesthetic inject contact nerve , also reduce due dilution local anesthetic glucose solution . In randomized study , investigator test hypothesis hydro-dissection alter nerve block onset time .</brief_summary>
