	<detailed_description>The protocol amend 15 March 2011 discontinue participant ' enrollment efficacy assessment , offer opportunity participant already enrol continue receive study treatment plan participation study . The study active several country approximately 1 year , enrollment significantly slow expect . Thus , decision make Sponsor terminate study since current project future enrollment rate would provide valuable information reasonable timeframe . All clinical efficacy magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedures remove protocol , safety assessment manage standard care activity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key 1 . Have diagnosis relapse remit multiple sclerosis ( MS ) define revise McDonald Committee criterion ( Polman 2005 ) . 2 . Must treat stable regimen either glatiramer acetate ( 20 mg per day subcutaneous ) interferon beta1a ( 44 mcg 3 time per week subcutaneous ) principal first therapy MS 6 18 month prior randomization . ( Note : prior treatment another MS therapy ≤ 30 day total duration exclusionary [ e.g . titration 44 mcg allow ] ) . 3 . Have disease activity within 12 month prior screen therapy ; disease activity must observe minimum 6 month therapy . Qualifying disease activity define : One clinical relapse OR Two new MRI lesion ( gadolinium [ Gd+ ] and/or T2 hyperintense ) For inclusion purpose : ( ) relapse define neurologic sign and/or symptom document medical record neurologist sufficient duration determine Investigator Treating Physician consistent MS relapse ( b ) MRI activity must verify central reader center . 4 . Be naïve natalizumab . 5 . Have document Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score 0.0 5.5 , inclusive . Key 1 . Have diagnosis primary progressive , secondary progressive , progressive relapsing MS ( define Lublin Reingold , 1996 ) . These condition require presence continuous clinical disease worsen period least 3 month . Patients condition may also superimpose relapse , distinguish relapsingremitting patient lack clinically stable period clinical improvement . 2 . Have know intolerance , contraindication , history noncompliance , use glatiramer acetate interferon beta1a . 3 . Have MS exacerbation ( relapse ) within 30 day prior randomization AND/OR patient stabilize previous relapse , opinion Investigator , prior randomization . 4 . The patient consider Investigator immunocompromised base medical history , physical examination , laboratory testing , due prior immunosuppressive immunomodulating treatment . 5 . Subjects MRI contraindicate , i.e. , pacemaker contraindicate implanted metal device , suffer risk side effect gadolinium ( Gd ) , claustrophobia medically manage . 6 . History clinically significant ( determined Investigator ) cardiac , endocrinologic , hematologic , hepatic , immunologic , metabolic , urologic , pulmonary , neurologic , dermatologic , psychiatric , renal , major disease would preclude participation clinical trial . 7 . History malignant disease , include solid tumor hematologic malignancy ( exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin completely excise consider cure ) . 8 . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 9 . Positive test result hepatitis C virus ( test hepatitis C virus antibody [ HCVAb ] ) hepatitis B virus ( test hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg ] and/or hepatitis B core antibody [ HBcAb ] ) . 10 . History transplantation antirejection therapy . 11 . History progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) . NOTE : Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
