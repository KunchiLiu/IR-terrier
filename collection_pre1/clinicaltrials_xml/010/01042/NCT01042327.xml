	<brief_summary>Today , haemodialysis recognize standard treatment patient chronic kidney disease stage 5 . During haemodialysis treatment session , blood pass patient extracorporeal circuit return . The dialyzer represent great surface extracorporeal circuit , dialysis treatment essentially base removal small molecular weight solute along concentration gradient , depend upon surface area . The ELISIO-H dialyzer differs design current standard dialyzer , FX100 , fiber great internal diameter , potentially allow internal haemofiltration , lead improve clearance large molecular weight solute . It think call `` middle molecular weight '' solute important contribute clinical condition term azotaemia , rather small solute urea . The investigator therefore wish study clearance middle sized molecule different dialyzer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Clearances Bio-compatibility ELISIO Dialyzer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stable chronic kidney dialysis patient , currently dialyze main Royal Free hospital dialysis unit ask participate study . It aim recruit 15 patient currently dialyse use Fresenius FX100 dialyzer , use Fresenius polysulphone membrane &gt; 3 month . During mid week dialysis session , dialysis adequacy assess line clearance , sample blood dialysate take ass , clearances bio-compatibility . Thereafter patient would switch dialyse use ELISIOTM-H dialyzer , continue dialysis prescription , 3 month , measurement repeat Assessments Primary Clearances : on-line Kt/V , dual pool Kt/V , phosphate , b2microglobulin , cystatin C Secondary Serum : isoprostane generation complement activation platelet activation - coagulation activation - thrombophilic marker - Other Anticoagulation requirement &amp; clot circuit erythropoietin requirement , phosphate control therapy CRP</detailed_description>
