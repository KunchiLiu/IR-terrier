	<detailed_description>Intrapartum assessment fetal head position station , cervical dilatation essential management labor . Precise knowledge parameter assist correct identification normal versus abnormal labor progression pattern , case latter , indicate medical operative intervention may require . Digital examination remain `` gold standard '' evaluation head station position cervical dilatation pregnancy ; however , inherent variability . evaluation reliability cervical dilatation assessment perform initially model , recently patient labor . Accuracy model range 51 % 59 % fall 50 % evaluated patient . However , labor management change substantially since . Induction labor , oxytocin use , epidural analgesia , fetal heart rate monitoring common contemporary practice whereas breech vaginal delivery mid forceps rarely perform . The mean body mass woman significantly high 50 year ago , may contribute increase fetal size , second stage prolong , increasingly occur use epidural analgesia . Some study suggest Friedman curve longer appropriate induce actively manage labor . In addition , full dilatation reach , although descent continue , monitor cervical dilation longer useful second stage . Descent second stage labor accompany rotation present part negotiate pelvis . Friedman Sachtleben show arrest descent frequently associate fetal malposition suggest abnormality rotation important prognostic factor second stage . The rate caesarean section major public health concern . Non progressive labor lead cause primary C-sections US . It well know non-progressive labor diagnose , determination pattern normal abnormal labor fundamental formulation strategy reduce caesarean section rate . In US , total cesarean delivery rate 2005 rise high level ever report - 30.3 % .After decline 1989 1996 , cesarean rate increase 46 percent 1996 low 20.7 . The American College Obstetricians Gynecologists Task Force Caesarian Delivery Rates ( 2000 ) recommend C-section rate 15.5 % nulliparous woman US year 2010 . The LaborPro provide tool frequent non-invasive evaluation head station position , head descend , head descend contraction , head position , head rotation , without increase risk maternal/fetal infection relate number vaginal examination . In addition , ruler-like determination cervical dilatation available TVDE , well measurement Pelvis diameter .</detailed_description>
