	<brief_summary>Ionizing radiation toxic agent widely accept form treatment various type cancer . Despite advance medical technology , radiation therapy still cause severe early late skin effect . Radiation-induced dermatitis occur approximately 80 % patient . Important consequence radiation-induced dermatitis include impairment quality patient 's life due pain premature interruption radiation treatment , turn , may impair good local control disease . The biological pathway responsible acute radiation-induced dermatitis remain unclear . Currently , standard treatment prevention radiation-induced dermatitis demonstrate effectiveness . The aim randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study ass effectiveness curcumin prevention acute radiation-induced dermatitis postoperative radiotherapy breast cancer . We hypothesize curcumin , natural phenolic compound find turmeric curry powder , prevent alleviate radiation-induced skin reaction breast cancer patient receive radiotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specifically , clinical pilot study develop data necessary calculate sample size large study conduct National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Community Clinical Oncology Program ( CCOP ) mechanism . Specifically , pilot project investigate : 1 ) curcumin prevent alleviate radiation-induced skin reaction cancer patient receive radiotherapy 2 ) skin pigmentation , well pain psychophysiological factor , predict severity radiation-induced dermatitis . Potential future research study may conduct identify biological mechanism involve radiation-induced dermatitis radioprotective function curcumin .</detailed_description>
