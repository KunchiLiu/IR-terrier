	<brief_summary>The provision adequate pain relief follow major liver surgery essential , patient comfort , prevention complication , chest infection . Commonly , pain relief first day surgery provide epidural analgesia . Drugs deliver area around spinal cord , fine plastic tube place patient back , block sensation abdomen downwards , thereby provide effective pain relief without need opiate analgesia ( e.g . morphine ) . Opiate analgesia cause nausea , drowsiness constipation , use minimise . Epidurals , however , associate problematic side effect . Low blood pressure commonly encounter , treatment associate complication , patient often confine bed . Mobility also limit muscle function leg , ( addition sensation ) , inadvertently affect epidural drug . Other problem associate epidural use relatively common failure technique provide adequate analgesia ( 20 % ) , extremely rare potentially disastrous complication epidural insertion . An alternative technique , provision pain relief directly wound , via one multi−holed tube ( catheter ) , place either close wound . This technique alone provide effective analgesia function epidural , combine intravenous oral analgesia , show effective follow variety surgical procedure . It hypothesise , follow major liver surgery , use latter technique may result superior outcome faster recovery , compare epidural , avoidance side effect complication discuss . In study , patient schedule undergo major liver surgery Royal Infirmary Edinburgh randomly assign receive first two day pain relief either epidural , wound catheter plus additional analgesia . Both group receive identical oral analgesic regime remainder hospital stay . Outcomes interest include quality pain relief attain , patient mobility , frequency complication , overall recovery time .</brief_summary>
