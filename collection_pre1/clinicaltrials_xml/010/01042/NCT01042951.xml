	<detailed_description>Adults well child , male female recruit study urban suburb around Dhaka city Mirpur conduct epidemiological vaccine relate study . The community inform field staff interested person might enrol study basis inclusion/exclusion criterion . Part I- Adults- 18-45 year age ( n=110 ) : Since oral bivalent whole-cell cholera vaccine test Bangladesh , study carry 3 age group , i.e . adult , follow toddler young child . These study participant recruit field site Mirpur . For purpose , 55 adult ( 18-45 year old ) give 2 dos bivalent whole-cell cholera vaccine 55 adult give placebo . Safety clinically monitor side effect 3 day dose study agent home visit . Participants randomize receive either 2 dos vaccine placebo , give 14 day apart . Part II- Children 2-5 year ( n=110 ) : If vaccine find safe adult study , test toddler field consist 55 child group . The child clinically monitor side effect 3 day dose vaccine . Part III- Children 12-23 month ( n=110 ) : Children field site recruit study study carry describe . Study procedure : Each phase study ( Part I onwards ) complete base development , progress , next phase initiate . If vaccine find without adverse effect adult test child , 2-5 year age follow young age group 12-23 month age . The result present Data Safety Monitoring Board complete safety surveillance part phase study proceed next study group . Surveillance side effect : The safety study agent monitor intervention initiate . In community , supervision carry physician train research assistant adverse reaction include diarrhea , vomit , nausea local systemic reaction record . For three group , 3 consecutive day dose study agent , participant guardian interview recall symptom health worker . All side-effects record 28 day reaction surveillance form local systemic reaction . If adverse event serious adverse event notify within study period field clinic available report possible management event . Reported symptoms appetite loss grade mild ( noticeable ) , moderate ( affect normal daily activity ) severe ( suspend normal daily activity ) . A clinical record form use record clinical sign symptom . In case serious adverse effect data enter separate form . If require study subject hospitalize Mirpur Treatment Center ICDDR , B Dhaka Hospital supervision study physicians.. Safety endpoint safety evaluation : The primary end point evaluate safety define occurrence follow diarrhoea , vomit abdominal cramp least moderate grade . Diarrhea define three loose liquid stool 24-h period 3 day surveillance period . STUDY INTERVENTION Vaccine Each dose vaccine contain whole cell inactivate heat kill formalin kill bacteria consist 600 ELISA Units ( EU ) lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . It consist formalin-killed V. cholerae Inaba , El Tor biotype ( strain Phil 6973 ) . It also contain 300 EU LPS heat-killed V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype ( Cairo 50 ) ; 300 EU LPS formalin kill V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype ( Cairo 50 ) ; 300 EU LPS heat-killed V. cholerae Inaba , classical biotype ( Cairo 48 ) ; 600 EU LPS formalin kill V. cholerae O139 ( 4260B ) ( 9 ) . The vaccine detectable cholera toxin . The study agent ( Vaccine placebo ) package liquid formulation 1.5-ml dos . The vaccine give two dos separate two week interval administer oral syringe without needle participant offer water . No buffer co administer . Placebo The placebo consist heat-killed Escherichia coli K12 identical appearance vaccine . This strain use placebo related study previous oral vaccine clinical trial Bangladesh elsewhere . Random Allocation Eligible participant assign receive vaccine placebo 1:1 ratio accord randomization schedule . Individual randomization list adult , toddler infant generate statistician IVI involve study way . The study agent label different letter code three different phase Shantha Biotechnics accord list provide IVI . The field staff allocate study agent participant accord next available number entry trial link randomization list provide IVI . The randomization list contain sequential number unique participant , block randomization ( fixed block length 4 ) process employ ensure effective balance intervention . Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) : A 4-5 member data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) formulate study Ethical Review Committee ( ERC ) ICDDR , B . This comprised member ERC , staff member ICDDR , B individual institution Bangladesh . The team also comprise International member . The member involve study way . Blinding Code Breaking Procedures Vials label letter code Shanta Biotechnics accord list provide IVI . All study personnel participant blind treatment assignment duration study . The identity study agent know participant parent/guardian , personnel involve conduct monitoring trial , investigator , study nurses/personnel completion study . The PI hold seal randomization list use necessary case adverse event may see study DSMB . Otherwise list unblinded completion study , complete entry edit relevant data initiation analysis . The entire data set lock prior unblinding . If intervention assignment un-blinded due reason , DSMB notify within 24 hour . Subject withdrawal study Respective participant parent participate child may discontinue his/her participation time enrollment without provide reason . No replacement occur withdrawal . The following criterion check visit subsequent intake study agent 1 . Use immunosuppressive immune-modifying drug study period ( corticosteroid would mean ≥0.5 mg/kg.day ) 2 . Administration immunoglobulins blood product study period If occurs might compromise per protocol assessment ( PP ) ; however , withdrawn study data use `` intention treat '' ( ITT ) analysis . The investigator ( ) might also withdraw participant , his/her clinical opinion , best interest participant concern consider non-compliant protocol . A participant might also withdraw due protocol violation , death early termination study sponsor . Wherever possible , test evaluation termination visit , specify protocol , carry . Duration study period individual participant The participant remain study 28 day . Schedule description observation visit : The following schedule use study case report form complete study day : 3 . Day 0 : After describe study initial verbal consent , medical history obtain thorough physical examination perform physician include measurement vitals sign . Once eligibility criterion meet , participant case child parent ask sign inform consent form . A blood stool sample would collect determine baseline immunological assay immune response . Following , participant allocate study intervention accord randomization list ( vaccine placebo ) . Voluntary solicit reactogenicity assess symptom immediate adverse event record 1 h intake study agent . The participant allow go home 4 . Day 1 : Participants return study center monitor voluntary solicit symptoms adverse event . 5 . Day 2 : Participants return study centre visit home ( exceptional circumstance , parent bring participant study centre ) monitor voluntary solicit symptoms adverse event . 6 . Day 7 : ( +3 day ) : Participants return study center . Blood sample collect clinic stool sample collect home clinic test vaccine specific immunologic response study participant . 7 . Day 14 : ( ± 2 day ) : Participants return study center . The participant allocate study intervention second time accord randomization list ( vaccine placebo ) .by blind third party dispenser . 8 . Day 14-16 : Participants return study centre visit home ( exceptional circumstance , parent bring participant study centre ) monitor voluntary solicit symptoms adverse event . Voluntary solicit reactogenicity assess symptom immediate adverse event . 9 . Day 21 : ( ± 3 day ) Blood stool sample test vaccine specific post immunization response . 10 . Day 28 : ( ± 3 day ) Clinical evaluation Study Termination Sample Size Calculation Outcome ( Primary Secondary ) Variable ( ) Safety Immunogenicity study Shantha cholera vaccine : The `` non-inferiority '' approach use 1 -sided 95 % confidence interval use calculate sample size since allow u rule clinically unacceptable high rate diarrheal adverse event occur 3 day either dose well establish vaccine induced adequate seroconversion V. cholerae O1 among recipient . Assuming 10 % diarrheal rate among placebo vaccine recipient alike , exclude vaccine-placebo difference rate diarrhea great 20 % ( upper boundary 1-tailed 95 % confidence interval ) power 0.9 , minimum number subject require group group adverse event 46 . The sample size calculate assumption important evaluate whether vaccine induces acceptable serum vibriocidal responses relation placebo group . Based immunogenicity study whole-cell kill oral cholera vaccine Bangladesh , make follow assumption . For serum vibriocidal response , define &gt; 4-fold increase baseline post-second dose either Inaba Ogawa antibody , age group ( 12-23 month , 2-5 year 18-45 year ) , assume 1 ) background rate response placebo group 5 % second dose 2 ) true rate vibriocidal responses vaccine group 25 % . At p &lt; 0.05 ( 1-tailed ) , 0.8 power , 1 1 allocation vaccine placebo , total 46 subject per group would need . Thus safety immunological response number 46 per group . With 15 % attrition rate , 53 . We select 55 group ( 110 per age group vaccine placebo recipient ) . We , therefore , select 55 subject per arm age group , total 330 subject .</detailed_description>
