	<brief_summary>There grow evidence immune system help fight cancer . This stimulated interest development application tumor vaccine several human solid tumor , include epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) . A major obstacle development vaccine specialty cell call regulatory T cell prevent immune system attack organ . These regulatory T cell also prevent immune system attack cancer cell . Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) , enzyme degrades essential amino acid tryptophan necessary T cell multiply , however regulatory T cell less susceptible low level tryptophan , still multiply . This allow cancer growth progression . This may explain genetic polymorphism ( change ) IDO gene , may alter function . Five change IDO gene describe . In research project , ask would donate small piece tumor ascites see examine IDO gene tumor cell see gene change present . We hope help u understand immune system work EOC . We hypothesize genetic polymorphism within IDO gene alter enzymatic activity affect outcome ovarian cancer patient . These finding potential translate method predict successful immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
