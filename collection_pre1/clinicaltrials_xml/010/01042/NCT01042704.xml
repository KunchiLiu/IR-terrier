	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm symptomatic Multiple Myeloma , SalmonDurie Stage II III International Staging System II III previously treat least one cycle specific therapy ; patient show progressive refractory disease , must meet least one follow parameter measurable disease : Bone marrow plasmacytosis &gt; 10 % plasma cell , sheet plasma cell , biopsy proven plasmacytoma must obtain within 6 week prior registration . Measurable level monoclonal protein ( M protein ) : &gt; 1 g/dL IgG IgM Mprotein &gt; 0.5 g/dL IgA IgD M protein serum protein electrophoresis OR &gt; 200 mg free light chain 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis must obtain within 4 week prior registration OR &gt; 20 mg/dL involve free light chain serum free light chain test abnormal kappa : lambda light chain ratio . Note serum urine mcomponents present , must follow order evaluate response . Both SPEP UPEP must perform within 28 day prior registration . Patients lytic bone disease , define least one lytic lesion accurately measure least one dimension . Patients must receive prior chemotherapy myeloma , last 4 week . Patients may previously receive autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . Prior treatment lenalidomide allow . Patients receive radiation precede 4 week entry onto study . Exception : local radiation therapy symptomatic bone lesion ( eg , uncontrolled pain high risk pathologic fracture ) Age &gt; = 18 year Life expectancy great 6 month . ECOG performance status &gt; =2 ( Karnofsky &gt; =60 % ) . Patients PS 3 eligible PS due pain , would likely improve treatment . Patients must normal organ marrow function define , obtain within 4 week prior registration : Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL ( may support transfusion growth factor ) leukocytes &gt; =2,000/ml absolute neutrophil count â‰¥1000/ ml platelet &gt; =75,000/mcL total bilirubin &gt; =2.5 mg/dl AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &gt; =5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl Patients must pregnant breast feeding . Due potential teratogenic property lenalidomide , use drug patient pregnant absolutely contraindicate . Further , woman childbearing potential sexually active male must agree avoid conception participate study . Specifically , woman childbearing potential must either agree refrain sexual intercourse employ dual method contraception , one highly effective ( IUD , birth control pill , tubal ligation partner vasectomy ) , another additional method ( condom , diaphragm , cervical cap ) 4 week prior receive lenalidomide , four week discontinue therapy . Sexually active male participate unless agree use condom ( even undergone prior vasectomy ) intercourse woman child bear potential take lenalidomide four week stop treatment . Women child bear potential ( hysterectomy absence menstrual period least 24 consecutive month ) must negative pregnancy test 1014 day prior initiation therapy repeat negative pregnancy test 24 hour prior initiation lenalidomide . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patient must inform investigational nature study . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Exception : local radiation therapy symptomatic bone lesion ( eg , uncontrolled pain high risk pathologic fracture ) Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition lenalidomide and/or Bendamustine agent use study . Patients second malignancy squamous/basal cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix unless tumor curatively treat least two year previously . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure . If patient fulldose anticoagulant , follow criterion meet enrollment : Must active bleeding pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g . tumor involve major vessel , know varix ) . Must platelet count &gt; 75,000 . Must stable INR 23 . Patients collect hematopoietic progenitor potential candidate autologous transplantation . Patients serious cardiac condition , myocardial infarction within 6 month heart disease define New York Heart Association Class III IV , Patients prior allogeneic stem cell transplant . Nonsecretory patient ( i.e. , patient meet minimum Mprotein light chain criterion )</criteria>
