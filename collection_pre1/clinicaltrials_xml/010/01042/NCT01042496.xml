	<brief_summary>This study compare glutamate neurometabolites measure proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) bipolar I II patient currently depress age-matched healthy control . The study also compare 1H-MRS bipolar I II patient take 12-week course lamotrigine . The goal study well understand neurobiology bipolar depression lamotrigine may therapeutically impact brain function mood response . The hypothesis comparison non-remission participant , bipolar participant achieve remission ( defined Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score &lt; 12 week 12 ) associate lamotrigine monotherapy exhibit great decrease glutamate ( Glu ) increase N-acetyl aspartate ( NAA ) , report cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) -corrected absolute concentration percent change baseline endpoint anterior cingulate ( AC ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression predominant prevail mood state bipolar disorder bipolar depression associate substantial morbidity mortality . However , comparison acute mania , bipolar depression understudy standpoint pathophysiology well clinical trial include FDA-approved treatment . Given lack evidence base guideline , clinician patient limited best treat depressive phase illness . Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) valuable , non-invasive method study in-vivo brain biochemistry . Of novel image paradigm , MRS uniquely position investigate biochemical mechanism drug action objectively measurable clinically relevant . As increase interest glutamatergic dysregulation mood disorder , project utilize 1H-MRS study glutamate glutamine level brain region implicate bipolar disorder ( anterior cingulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) . This 5-year single-site study bipolar depression utilize 1H-MR spectroscopy treatment lamotrigine . At baseline bipolar depress subject age-matched control underwent 1H-MRS Mayo Clinic Rochester , Minnesota . The bipolar depress subject place 12-week , open evaluation lamotrigine monotherapy . After 12 week , bipolar subject underwent second 1H-MRS scan . Two different MRS sequence use measure brain chemical single 2 x 2 x 2 cm cube locate center anterior cingulate cortex : intermediate echo-time PRESS sequence 2D J-resolved averaged PRESS sequence . Spectroscopic data inspect quality ; subject whose data contaminate artifact exclude study . Spectra process use LCModel quantify brain chemical level . Regular brain MRI image segment , yield map amount CSF head . The MRS cube overlay onto CSF map fraction CSF within cube measure . This measurement use `` remove '' CSF MRS cube give brain chemical concentration . The concentration use statistical analysis . Note : All spectroscopy data express Institutional Units ( IU ) .</detailed_description>
