	<brief_summary>The current study case control study involve comparison tissue interstitial fluid breast cancer adjacent non-cancerous tissue well benign breast lesion adjacent non-diseased tissue distinguishable breast cancer profile . The purpose research collect fresh breast nodule/cancer surround non-cancerous tissue proteomic study interstitial fluid identify profile distinguish breast cancer also permit future research store interstitial fluid , blood tissue sample . Specific marker identify interstitial fluid study investigate blood sample develop serum marker breast cancer diagnosis prognosis . Additionally , perform prospective retrospective research breast cancer involve clinical , demographic , epidemiologic information , treatment , follow-up outcome breast nodule/cancer case collect .</brief_summary>
