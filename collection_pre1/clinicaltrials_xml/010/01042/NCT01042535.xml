	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy 1-MT Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) safety use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 , combination Ad.p53 DC vaccine ( adenovirus-p53 transduce dendritic cell vaccine ) plus 1-MT patient solid malignancy mutate p53 immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine efficacy ( objective response rate ) combination Ad.p53 DC vaccine plus 1-MT metastatic breast cancer patient whose tumor express mutate p53 IHC . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect preliminary data study p53 specific interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISPOT ) measurement baseline , week 7 week 16 . ( Phase I ) II . To collect preliminary data study percentage p53 specific IFN-gamma ELISPOT responder week 7 16 . ( Phase II ) III . To collect preliminary data study progression-free survival study treatment . ( Phase II ) IV . To collect preliminary data study response progression-free survival subsequent chemotherapy administer . ( Phase II ) V. To collect preliminary data study effect 1-methyl-D-tryptophan ( 1-MT ) serum kynurenine , serum tryptophan , C reactive protein , circulate T-regulatory cell ( cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ 25+ CD127low forkhead box P3+ ( FoxP3+ ) ) flow cytometry vaccination point study compare corresponding baseline . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive adenovirus-p53 transduce dendritic cell vaccine intradermally ( ID ) week 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , every 3 week 6 total dos . Patients also receive 1-methyl-d-tryptophan orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment 1-methyl-d-tryptophan repeat every 28 day ( patient stable disease ) 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
