	<brief_title>Study Best Timing Plerixafor Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Collection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current FDA-approved timing plerixafor approximately 11 hour prior apheresis . This logistical problem , since plerixafor administer health care provider , give risk hypotension administration . The primary purpose study , autologous donor non-Hodgkins lymphoma multiple myeloma undergo hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization plerixafor G-CSF , determine whether dose interval increase 16 hour prior apheresis . Patients admit special clinical research center 4th day G-CSF administration , peripheral blood CD34+ count measure every 2 hour plerixafor administration 5 pm 9 AM follow day , time apheresis commence . The hypothesis plerixafor administration 16 hour prior apheresis safe effective plerixafor administration 11 hour prior apheresis .</detailed_description>
