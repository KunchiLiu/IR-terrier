	<brief_summary>When expose oxygen immediately birth , newborn suffer oxidative stress significant decrease serum concentration anti-oxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase . This oxidative stress consequently link development adverse outcome premature full term infant . In study , examine effect oxygen administration deliver mother immediately labor newborn . In randomized trial , plan measure superoxide dismutase umbilical cord blood mother receive receive oxygen..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct prospective randomize control clinical trial cohort deliver woman admit Childbirth center George Washington University Hospital . This study approve Institutional Review Board George Washington University consent obtain subject enrollment . All enrolled subject meet follow criterion : ) uncomplicated pregnancy , b ) term gestational age complete 37 week 42 week , c ) normal spontaneous vaginal delivery ( NSVD ) elective caesarean section . Pregnant woman exclude study follow : ) hypertension , eclampsia , b ) pregnancy induce diabetes , c ) anemia , ) medical surgical complication current pregnancy , e ) rupture amniotic membrane 18 hour , f ) history infant invasive group B Streptococcal disease previous pregnancy , g ) fetal distress delivery h ) suspect chromosomal , structural anomaly congenital infection . We collect data maternal history ( age , race , parity type anesthesia ) birth history ( anthropometric measurement , gestational age , sex , Apgar score ) . Randomization : Once enrol study , subject randomly assign one two group use seal opaque envelope technique . A nasal cannula attach subject connect flowmeter cover metal foil manage obstetrician aware group particular subject belongs . The Oxygen Group participants receive 100 % oxygen 2 litters/minute start least 30 minute delivery . The Control Group participant nasal cannula still attach flowmeter turn . Nasal cannula disconnect participant delivery . Monitoring procedure : Pregnant woman monitor continuously heart rate , respiratory rate oxygen saturation . If oxygen saturation decrease &lt; 93 % least 60 second , and/or consider necessary obstetrician time , therapeutic oxygen administer participant exclude study . Laboratory investigation : We obtain three sample three ml whole blood mother-infant pair group . The first blood sample obtain participant ' peripheral vein time enrollment randomization ( Baseline ) . The second blood sample obtain placental side umbilical cord delivery . The third sample obtain partcipants ' peripheral vein within 4 hour delivery . We measure blood gas sample bedside use iSTAT analyzer ( Abbott , IL ) . The rest sample use SOD assay . It collect iced-tube containing EDTA , centrifuge 4 ºC . Plasma discard erythrocyte suspension wash normal saline centrifuge twice . Washed erythrocyte suspension store -70 ºC time assay . SOD concentration measure indirect colorimetric method use highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt WST-1 , produce water-soluble formazan dye upon reduction superoxide anion . The Cayman Chemical SOD assay kit use measurement SOD activity erythrocyte lysate . SOD activity assess measure dismutation superoxide radical generate xanthine oxidize hypoxanthine convenient 96 well format . This technique include quality-controlled SOD standard . The standard curve , generate use enzyme , provide mean accurately quantify activity three type SOD ( Cu/Zn- , Mn- , Fe-SOD ) . SOD concentration express IU per gram hemoglobin content . Results SOD concentration , pH , pCO2 , pO2 , base deficit , Ht Na concentration record .</detailed_description>
