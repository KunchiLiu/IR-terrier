	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study paclitaxel carboplatin see well work compare bleomycin sulfate , etoposide phosphate , cisplatin treat patient sex cord-ovarian stromal tumor spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( advance ) return ( recurrent ) . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know chemotherapy regimen effective treat sex cord-ovarian stromal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Carboplatin Bleomycin Sulfate , Etoposide Phosphate , Cisplatin Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Sex Cord-Ovarian Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity paclitaxel carboplatin respect progression free survival ( use bleomycin , etoposide , cisplatin [ BEP ] reference ) newly diagnose advanced recurrent chemonaive ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate toxicity paclitaxel carboplatin , bleomycin , etoposide , cisplatin patient population . II . To estimate overall survival paclitaxel carboplatin relative BEP . III . To evaluate response rate subset patient measurable disease . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect fixed and/or frozen tumor tissue future translational research study . II . To explore utility inhibin A inhibin B prognostic predictive biomarkers ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor examine change marker treatment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive bleomycin sulfate IV day 1 etoposide phosphate* IV 1 hour cisplatin IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients receive prior radiotherapy receive etoposide phosphate day 1-4 . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
