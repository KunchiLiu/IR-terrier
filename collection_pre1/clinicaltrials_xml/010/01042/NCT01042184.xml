	<brief_summary>Background : Helicobacter pylori infection show associate development gastric cancer peptic ulcer disease . Eradication H. pylorus infection could reduce occurence recurrence disease . However , eradication rate clarithromycin-based triple therapy decline recent year , probably related increase resistant rate clarithromycin . It estimate 15-20 % patient would fail first line standard eradication therapy need second line rescue therapy . About 15-30 % patient would fail second line therapy need rescue third line therapy . In recent year , concept sequential therapy advocate treatment H. pylorus infection . The regimen include PPI plus amoxicillin five day , follow PPI plus clarithromycin tinidazole another five day . The eradication rate first line treatment sequential therapy report high 90 % . More importantly , demonstrate eradication rate among patient clarithromycin-resistant strain could high 89 % . However , tinidazole available many country . Whether metronidazole would effective alternative tinidazole sequential therapy remain unknown . Besides , whether extend duration sequential therapy 10-day 14-day would result high eradication rate also deserve investigation . Furthermore , data efficacy rescue regimens patient fail first line sequential therapy also lack . The impact clarithromycin , metronidazole resistance CYP2C19 polymorphism sequential therapy contain metronidazole ( rather tinidazole ) also report . Aims : Therefore , aim ass 1. whether substitution metronidazole tinidazole sequential therapy also effective clarithromycin-based triple therapy 2. whether extend duration sequential therapy 10-day 14-day would achieve high eradication rate 3. whether levofloxacin-based sequential therapy 14-days effective second line rescue regimen fail first line sequential therapy 4. impact antibiotic resistance CYP2C19 polymorphism eradication rate sequential therapy</brief_summary>
