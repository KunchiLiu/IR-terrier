	<brief_summary>This 36-week , randomize , double-blind , parallel group study compare effect tadalafil monotherapy , ambrisentan monotherapy combination therapy tadalafil ambrisentan patient PAH-SSc . Standard outcome measure six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) , NYHA classification , hemodynamic measurement assess , well novel functional measure RV-PV function include transthoracic echocardiogram parameter tricuspid annular plane systolic ejection ( TAPSE ) , contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI heart rate variability assess Holter monitoring . This design ( exclude placebo-placebo arm ) select ethical concern provide optimal efficiency active therapy study subject . It also allow comparison two monotherapies combination therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Ambrisentan Tadalafil Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated With Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) include heterogeneous group clinical entity share similar clinical pathological feature subcategorized idiopathic PAH ( IPAH , formerly know `` primary pulmonary hypertension '' PPH ) , familial PAH , pulmonary hypertension relate connective tissue disease ( systemic sclerosis ) , portopulmonary hypertension pulmonary hypertension relate HIV infection , drug toxin ( 10 ) . PAH clinically define rest mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mmHg pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg absence leave heart disease , underlie parenchymal lung disease , thromboembolic disease cause pulmonary hypertension . PAH characterize increase pulmonary vascular resistance due remodel occlusion pulmonary arteriole . Left untreated , PAH lead irremediably right ventricular ( RV ) hypertrophy , pressure overload dilation result death within 2-3 year ( 11 ) . For past two decade , appreciate integrity RV function , rather degree pulmonary vascular injury , major determinant symptom mortality patient PAH . RV dysfunction time presentation , reflect elevation right atrial pressure ( RAP ) , presence pericardial effusion depress cardiac output ( CO ) , powerful prognosticator death ( 12 ) . Current PAH therapy consist prostacyclin analogue , endothelin receptor antagonist ( ETRA ) phosphodiesterase type V ( PDE V ) inhibitor ( 13 ) . All show effective improving exercise capacity measure 6 MWD short term ( 12 - 16 week ) randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial . However , clinical response highly variable mortality remain high ( 14 ) . Moreover , majority subject enrol trial IPAH . Over past 10 year , Johns Hopkins Pulmonary Hypertension Program Scleroderma Center work closely address daunt clinical challenge PAH associate scleroderma systemic sclerosis ( PAH-SSc ) . Previous work group ( 15 ; 16 ) others ( 17-19 ) clearly demonstrate markedly bad prognosis PAH-SSc compare IPAH despite similar treatment . An intriguing consistent find compare two group whereas mPAP , average , low PAH-SSc , marker RV dysfunction ( e.g . CO RAP ) similar , raise possibility maladaptive RV response pressure overload and/or intrinsic myocardial disease . Current PAH therapy target pathway implicate remodel pulmonary vasculature ( PV ) . However , clear evidence therapy alter PV and/or RV remodeling offer significant beneficial effect patient PAH-SSc mortality remain exceedingly high . In addition , effect RV dysfunction RV-PV interaction remain poorly characterize . We hypothesize improvement PAH-SSc achieve therapy directly target RV-PV dysfunction . Sildenafil tadalafil inhibit phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) abundant lung main enzyme responsible cGMP hydrolysis . The resulting increase cGMP probably mediate relaxant anti-hypertrophic action nitric oxide natriuretic peptide vascular tissue , exerts direct anti-hypertrophic action cardiac muscle demonstrate compelling preliminary experiment investigator NHLBI-funded Hopkins Scientific Center Clinically Oriented Research ( SCCOR ) Pulmonary Vascular Disease . In experiment , sildenafil capable prevent reverse RV hypertrophy dysfunction model pulmonary artery banding , similar effect leave ventricle aortic banding ( 20 ) , indicate direct beneficial action RV remodeling . Both sildenafil ( 21 ) tadalafil ( 22 ) demonstrate effective PAH FDA approve indication . The endothelin-receptor antagonist , bosentan ( 23 ) ambrisentan ( 24 ) , also FDA-labeled indication represent alternative option oral therapy PAH ( 25 ) . A small randomized study compare sildenafil bosentan suggest sildenafil superior reduce RV mass improve exercise capacity patient PAH ( 26 ) . Recently , result large multi-center randomized , control trial tadalafil therapy PAH present . The data indicate , similar sildenafil , tadalafil dose 20 40 mg per day , improve exercise capacity . In addition , tadalafil 40 mg per day improve pulmonary hemodynamics , quality life reduce incidence clinical worsening . This study aim compare effect tadalafil therapy , ambrisentan therapy combination agent PAH-SSc PVR RV mass . It also assess novel marker RV function cardiac MRI echocardiography , well conventional endpoint , include 6 MWD functional class . The trial unique enroll PAH-SSc patient , PAH subgroup poor outcomes considerably long duration ( 36 week ) previous study . In addition , effect first line combination therapy ETRA/PDE V inhibitor compare single agent regimen .</detailed_description>
