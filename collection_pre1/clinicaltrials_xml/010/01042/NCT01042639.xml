	<brief_summary>Studies demonstrate brief ( 5-10 min day ) passive range-of-motion exercise beneficial bone development low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm infant . However , optimal duration frequency exercise bone development preterm infant yet unknown . The effect exercise immune system widely study adult child . Exercise induces increase IL-6 , IL-10 , IL1ra . In adult even 10 minute flexion extension wrist cause systemic increase IL-6 . The effect physical activity pro anti inflammatory cytokine preterm infant study . Objectives : 1 . To assess weather twice daily exercise intervention enhance bone strength compare day intervention 2 . To evaluate effect single exercise intervention inflammatory mediator . Methods : Single center ( Meir Medical Center ) , double blind , randomize control study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infants randomly assign one 3 study group . Group 1 - physical activity day . Group 2 - physical activity twice day group 3 - control . The physical activity program base Moyer-Mileur et al protocol ( 1 ) . Briefly , protocol involve extension flexion range-of-motion exercise passive resistance upper low extremity . Both extension flexion perform five time wrist , elbow , shoulder , ankle , knee , hip joint ( 10 minute session ) . Infant group 1 physical activity intervention day , 5 day week . Infant group 2 physical activity intervention twice day , five time week . Infant group 3 , control group similar time ( 10 minute ) daily interactive period hold stroke without range-of-motion activity . The physical activity do person ( NICU physiotherapist ) Growth parameter , bone strength , measure enrollment every 2 week till discharge . Bone strength assessment determine quantitative ultrasound measurement bone speed sound ( SOS ) middle leave tibial shaft ( Sunlight Omnisense Premier ) . All measurement perform person , blind group assignment . Cytokines study In sub-group patient arterial line enrollment blood sample ( 0.6 CC ) draw immediately follow activity assessment proinflammatory ( IL-6 ) anti-inflammatory ( IL1-ra ) cytokine . Samples keep -20ยบ C analyze completion study .</detailed_description>
