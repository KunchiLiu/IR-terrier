	<brief_summary>Phase 1 study evaluate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) XL147 give combination trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) combination trastuzumab paclitaxel . After MTD establish combination ( Phase 2 ) , subject enrolled evaluate preliminary efficacy safety combination metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer . Both trastuzumab paclitaxel use treatment metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) , patient develop resistance . The link PI3K mutation trastuzumab resistance see breast cancer patient . This suggest inhibitor PI3K/PTEN pathway may potential restore sensitivity trastuzumab . Similarly , introduction activate mutant form PI3K show transform confer paclitaxel resistance immortalize breast epithelial cell . XL147 potent selective inhibitor PI3K inhibit phosphorylation multiple downstream component PI3K/PTEN signal . Therefore , XL147 may utility treatment trastuzumab resistant/refractory HER2-positive MBC administer combination trastuzumab alone trastuzumab paclitaxel .</brief_summary>
