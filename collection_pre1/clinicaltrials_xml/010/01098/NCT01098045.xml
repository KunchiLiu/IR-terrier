	<brief_summary>The specific aim study determine whether HIV-infected patient significant fat redistribution ectopic fat accumulation increase brown adipose tissue use 18F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography technique . Recent study suggest regulation Dicer , major component miRNA important role differentiation function brown white adipose tissue may contribute lipodystrophy . Therefore expand recent research area recruit HIV-infected men lipodystrophy . We perform subcutaneous fat biopsy dorsocervical abdominal fat subset HIV-infected non-HIV-infected men order explore question regulation Dicer implication metabolic abnormalities population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Among individual infect HIV , highly active antiretroviral therapy reduce incidence morbidity mortality however , despite recent improvement newer antiretrovirals patient continue exhibit secondary effect relate body composition lipoatrophy periphery , increase adiposity trunk lipomatosis , especially dorsocervical spine . Changes body composition report 40-50 % HIV-infected patient . Several study show antiretroviral therapy contributes change body composition couple increase dyslipidemia , insulin resistance diabetes . Accumulation fat dorsocervical spine , `` buffalo '' report 2 % 13 % HIV-infected patient . Enlargement adipose tissue dorsocervical region involve subcutaneous fat therefore unique fat accumulation abdominal area . Guallar et al . examined dorsocervical adipose tissue surgical removal find adipose tissue area show substantial level marker gene brown fat , uncouple protein 1 ( UCP-1 ) suggesting may brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) HIV infected individual lipomatosis dorsocervical spine . Until recently , BAT know present rodent throughout lifetime think present human infancy early childhood . However , recent study use 18F-FDG PET-CT confirm presence BAT adult . Brown adipose tissue know affect whole-body metabolism may relate insulin sensitivity well susceptibility weight gain . Using 18F-FDG PET technique , group evaluate HIV-infected subject lipoatrophy note significantly increase glucose uptake subcutaneous tissue may suggest presence BAT HIV-infected patient . However previous study specifically examine area BAT subject . Therefore , use 18F-FDG PET-CT addition fat biopsy propose explore presence BAT fat depot among HIV-infected patient fat redistribution , focus specifically cervical area . Also , recent study suggest regulation Dicer , major component miRNA important role differentiation function brown white adipose tissue may contribute lipodystrophy . We perform subcutaneous fat biopsy dorsocervical abdominal fat subset HIV-infected non-HIV-infected men order explore question regulation Dicer implication metabolic abnormalities population .</detailed_description>
