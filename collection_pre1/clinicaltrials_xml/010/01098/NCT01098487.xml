	<brief_title>A Longitudinal 2-year Bone Marrow Study Eltrombopag Previously Treated Adults , With Chronic Immune ( Idiopathic ) Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IV , open-label safety study , design determine baseline level bone marrow fiber previously treat adult chronic immune ( idiopathic ) thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) evaluate long-term effect eltrombopag bone marrow reticulin and/or collagen fiber . The duration screen period 8 week . Eltrombopag administer least 2-years follow 4-week follow-up period . Bone marrow biopsy perform screen , 1-year 2-years eltrombopag treatment , early withdrawal treatment . The screen bone marrow biopsy perform within 8 week plan start study medication bone marrow biopsy block must available central laboratory processing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must sign date write informed consent able understand comply protocol requirement instruction . Adults ( ≥18 year ) diagnose chronic ITP accord American Society Hematology/British Committee Standards Hematology ( ASH/BCSH ) guideline [ George , 1996 ; BCSH , 2003 ; Provan , 2009 ] . In addition , peripheral blood smear support diagnosis ITP evidence disease causative thrombocytopenia ( e.g. , pseudo thrombocytopenia , myelofibrosis ) . The physical examination suggest disease , may cause thrombocytopenia ITP . Subjects must physically eligible serial bone marrow biopsy must bone marrow biopsy perform screening , willing remain study least 2 year annual bone marrow biopsy . Subjects , previously receive eltrombopag romiplostim , must complete treatment therapy least 6 month prior screen bone marrow biopsy . Subjects must follow clinical chemistry value : ALT AST &lt; 2xULN ; Bilirubin &lt; 1.5xULN ( except Gilbert 's Syndrome ) ; Subjects practice acceptable method contraception specify protocol . In France , subject eligible inclusion study , either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Subjects clinically relevant abnormality , ITP , medical condition circumstance , opinion investigator make subject unsuitable participation study suggest another primary diagnosis ( e.g. , thrombocytopenia secondary another disease ) . Subjects concurrent malignant disease and/or recent history cancer treatment systemic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Exception : Subjects history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . Subjects prior history arterial venous thrombosis ( stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) , AND ≥ two follow risk factor : hormone replacement therapy , systemic contraception ( contain estrogen ) , smoke , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , cancer , hereditary thrombophilic disorder ( e.g. , Factor V Leiden , ATIII deficiency , etc ) , family history arterial venous thrombosis . Subjects screen bone marrow fiber either MF Grade 3 use European Consensus scale Grade 4 use Bauermeister scale . Subjects QTc &gt; 450 msec &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . Female subject nursing pregnant ( positive serum urine βhuman chorionic gonadotrophin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test ) screening . Subjects treat investigational drug ( thrombopopoetinreceptor ( TPOR ) agonist ) within 30 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose eltrombopag study . ( For romiplostim eltrombopag , see inclusion criterion # 4 ) . Subjects treat TPOR agonist romiplostim eltrombopag . Subjects recent history alcohol/drug abuse determine investigator .</criteria>
