	<brief_title>Nitrite Mediated Cardioprotection During Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , much interest sodium nitrite cytoprotective agent vitro animal model . A recent study undertaken canine model myocardial infarction demonstrate 50 % reduction myocardial injury follow administration sodium nitrite prior ischemic event . In human , set coronary artery bypass surgery lend well study potential cytoprotective agent . During cardiac surgery , heart undergoes period ischemia allow surgeon operate heart . This follow period reperfusion add cellular injury . Such injury hind post-operative myocardial recovery . The aim pilot study determine whether cardioprotective effect sodium nitrite demonstrate animal model translate human determine exact underlying mechanism cytoprotection . Patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery give write , inform consent receive sodium nitrite 24 hour prior surgery , cardiac surgery placebo . Myocardial injury assess measurement biochemical marker troponin T. Cardiac biopsy sample obtain determine underlying molecular mechanism cardioprotection . The aim pilot study determine dose sodium nitrite ( i.e . 0.2mcg/kg/min 1mcg/kg/min ) optimal cardioprotection . This study form pilot data also large clinical trial clinical endpoint .</detailed_description>
