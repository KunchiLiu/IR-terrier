	<brief_summary>GSK1349572 integrase inhibitor currently Phase 2 clinical trial treatment HIV infection . As GSK1349572 development progress , may dose non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) include efavirenz ( EFV , Sustiva ) . Efavirenz known inducer CYP3A4 . GSK1349572 primarily metabolize via UGT1A1 , however also CYP component metabolism , thus drug interaction GSK1349572 EFV likely . A previous study show another NNRTI , etravirine also know inducer CYP3A UGT , reduce GSK1349572 exposure significantly . GSK1349572 inhibitor inducer CYP3A expect impact pharmacokinetics ( PK ) EFV . This study investigate dose proportionality single dose 50mg 100mg GSK1349572 compare steady-state plasma PK , safety tolerability GSK1349572 50 mg every 24h ( q24h ) without efavirenz 600 mg q24h . Approximately 12 subject receive single dose GSK1349572 100 mg ( Treatment A ) Period 1 follow washout great equal 6 day . In Period 2 subject receive GSK1349572 50mg q24h 5 day ( Treatment B ) . Subjects administer GSK1349572 50mg q24h morning combination EFV 600 mg q24h ( Treatment C ) even 14 day Period 3 . There washout Periods 2 3 . Safety evaluation serial PK sample GSK1349572 collect treatment period . A follow-up visit occur 7-14 day last dose study drug . This study conduct one center US , healthy adult male female subject .</brief_summary>
