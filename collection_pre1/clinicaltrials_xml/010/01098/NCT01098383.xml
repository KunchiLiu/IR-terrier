	<brief_summary>We propose study combine multiple modality evaluate treatment response child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) acetyl-choline esterase ( AChE ) inhibitor choline supplement . The primary objective study examine efficacy treatment improve core autistic symptom . The Secondary objective study evaluate safety tolerability treatment protocol ASD child . Exploratory objectives include evaluation influence treatment linguistic performance , comorbid behavior , adaptive functioning executive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) group developmental disorder brain function result distinct phenotype , probably relate many specific cause . Individuals disorder autism spectrum heterogeneous group patient early childhood onset deficit social interaction , communication language , repetitive stereotypic behavior . ASD become increasingly prevalent last decade ( Wiznitzer , 2005 ) . The neuro-anatomical substrate ASD subject intense investigation , current finding inconclusive , limit sometimes even contradictory . Medical treatment autism still matter dispute . Medications use mainly aim treat comorbid symptom , epilepsy , tic , obsessive-compulsive hyperactive behavior ( Wiznitzer , 2005 ) . Although many effort invest establish model autistic pathophysiology , model currently accept , evidence efficient treatment core autistic symptom ( Wiznitzer , 2005 ) . Previous study indicate many brain system involve expression autism . Specifically , suggest autism involve neurotransmitter dysregulations ( Lam et al , 2006 ) . A recent investigation cholinergic system autism , detail , provide promising finding . Our study aim assess clinical outcome associate cholinergic manipulation use pharmacological agent nutritional supplement . The study approve Helsinki committee clinical research .</detailed_description>
