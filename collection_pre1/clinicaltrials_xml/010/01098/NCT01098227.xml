	<brief_summary>The fraction exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) expire air reliable measure airway inflammation use marker asthma respiratory illness primary ciliary dyskinesia , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , liver cirrhosis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Although , exquisite bench research experiment demonstrate stimulation nitric oxide production respiratory epithelial cell infect RSV , paucity clinical data regard level feNO viral respiratory illness specifically RSV . The investigator conduct pilot study fall 2007 October 2009 , look FeNO level RSV infect patient compare non-RSV viral infection . The investigator recruit total 28 RSV positive 1 RSV negative subject , well 4 control subject . The investigator find FeNO value statistically significant study group ( two-tailed p=0.09 , consider quite significant ) , trend high FeNO value non-RSV group compare RSV group . A large sample may detect statistically significance 2 group . Objectives : . To determine fraction exhale nitric oxide ( feNO ) elevate hospitalized pediatric patient viral low respiratory illness compare normal subject without respiratory symptom . ii . To determine difference feNO level RSV non-RSV infection hospitalize pediatric patient viral low respiratory illness . Method feNO measurement utilized offline option preschool child &amp; infant appropriate age describe 2005 Joint Statement American Thoracic Society &amp; European Respiratory Society discuss tidal breathe technique uncontrolled flow rate . The investigator plan sample sizes RSV+ control group , design , three time large RSV- group . In order achieve 80 % power , investigator require 45 control 45 RSV+ patient , 15 RSV- patient</brief_summary>
