	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness radioactive microsphere infusion treatment liver metastases colon rectal cancer . The investigator hypothesis administration microspheres first second line chemotherapy increase progression-free survival time 2.5 month may also improve tumor response rate subsequent second line chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Yttrium-90 Radioactive Resin Microspheres Treat Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Metastatic Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single-arm study Yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) radioactive resin microspheres treatment colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic liver patient progressive disease first line combination chemotherapy otherwise fail first line chemotherapy due toxicity . Expected enrollment University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) approximately 34 subject . The dose Yttrium-90 radioactive resin microspheres calculate base body surface area ( estimate normal liver volume ) , percentage total liver represent targeted lobe , percentage lobe occupy tumor , correct percentage lung shunt . The prescribed dose , calculate nuclear medicine physician , deliver interventional radiologist use standard delivery system frequent fluoroscopic monitoring assure ante grade blood flow immediately treatment . Additional current standard practice include obtain nuclear medicine scan patient immediately therapeutic Yttrium-90 microspheres administration prove delivery agent target portion liver absence either extra-hepatic Yttrium-90 delivery free Yttrium-90 . Blood sample obtain one week first treatment microspheres . If patient bi-lobar disease result lab test meet protocol specify criterion , dose repeat initially-untreated lobe . If lab test meet protocol specify criterion ( i.e . study inclusion/exclusion criterion ) , treatment defer fourteen day labs repeat . If within parameter , patient receive second dose . If within parameter , patient proceed chemotherapy . Patients remain chemotherapy final microspheres treatment minimum three week . Second line treatment option include FDA approve anti-neoplastic agent use colorectal cancer metastatic liver exception bevacizumab capecitabine , less rigorously study relation Yttrium-90 radioactive microspheres therefore use . When patient find progressive disease receive second line chemotherapy , undergo comprehensive clinical , laboratory , image assessment enter follow-up phase assess every five seven month death withdrawal consent . A contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) perform pre microsphere treatment ( within 14 day ) , post microsphere treatment ( 2 week , 4 week , 8 week 12 week post microsphere treatment ) . If patient require two treatment microspheres , evaluate 2 , 4 , 8 12 week post second treatment .</detailed_description>
