	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : MK0752 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving MK0752 together gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose give MK0752 together gemcitabine hydrochloride see well work treat patient stage III IV pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine recommended phase II dose MK0752 combination gemcitabine hydrochloride patient unresectable stage III IV pancreatic cancer . ( Phase I ) Secondary - To evaluate tumor response patient treat regimen . - To determine time disease progression 6 month 1-year survival . - To determine percentage change CA19-9 level . Tertiary - To assess target inhibition MK0752 plasma . - To explore feasibility measure MK0752 level tumor tissue . - To establish relationship measure tumor expression molecular target objective tumor response . - To determine pharmacokinetic profile MK0752 plasma administer without gemcitabine hydrochloride . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study MK0752 gemcitabine hydrochloride . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients receive oral MK0752 day -14 , -7 , 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 begin course 2 subsequent course . Treatment MK0752 gemcitabine hydrochloride repeat every 28 days* 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *The first course 42 day . Patients undergo biopsy tumor baseline day -7 . Tumor sample analyze determine Notch pathway inhibition via IHC qualitative RT-PCR analysis MK0752 concentration . Hair follicle ( head ) sample collected baseline day -7 determine Notch pathway inhibition via RT-PCR . Blood sample collect periodically determine change CA 19-9 level MK0752 concentration . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 2 month 1 year . Patients follow part normal clinic visit one year last patient treat study .

If gemcitabine treatment give previously , patient must tolerate dose least 800mg/m2 . Previous chemotherapy malignant disease must complete least 3 week treatment trial ( six week mitomycin C ) No major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover No concurrent participation plan participation another interventional clinical study Concurrent participation observational study allow No concurrent warfarin Low molecular weight heparin allow No concurrent radiotherapy ( except palliative bone pain ) , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy No concurrent anticancer therapy investigational drug</criteria>
