The primary outcome measure change time 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating score . We hypothesize R. rosea superior efficacy vs. placebo comparable efficacy vs. sertraline . For specific aim # 2 , ask : Does R. rosea therapy result favorable tolerability quality life ( QOL ) profile vs. sertraline placebo ? To answer question , obtain safety QOL measure across treatment condition include : ( ) frequency , duration , severity adverse event , ( ii ) frequency serious adverse event , ( iii ) frequency dosage reduction , ( iv ) frequency treatment discontinuation , ( v ) QOL sexual performance measure . We hypothesize R. rosea superior tolerability profile vs. sertraline , similar tolerability vs. placebo . We hypothesize R. rosea superior QOL sexual performance rating vs. sertraline placebo .
