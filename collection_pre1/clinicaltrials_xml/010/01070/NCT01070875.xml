	<brief_summary>This study design assess incidence abnormal partial thromboplastin time patient receive unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) 5000 U 2 time day versus 3 time day . The basic hypothesis study patient receive UFH 5000 U subcutaneously 3 time day high proportion elevate partial thromboplastin time patient receive UFH 5000 U subcutaneously twice day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partial Thromboplastin Time During First 24 Hours Antithrombotic Prophylaxis Using Unfractionated Heparin ( UFH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Administration subcutaneous UFH antithrombotic prophylaxis standard therapy postoperative setting . Often , dosage 5000 U twice day use , demonstrate antithrombotic efficacy acceptable hemorrhagic complication profile . However , recent surgery guideline regard antithrombotic prophylaxis UFH 5000 U suggest thrice daily regimen use follow major oncologic surgery . These new guideline raise concern anaesthesiology , particularly regard safety epidural catheter combine thrice daily heparin . Optimal analgesia early postoperative period follow type major oncologic surgery involve placement epidural catheter . Epidural analgesia provide best relief significant pain may present thoracotomy supraumbilical laparotomy early postoperative period , improve ambulation , cough , pulmonary function , bowel function well short long-term quality life . However , benefit epidural catheter must outweigh risk complication , fear spinal hematoma . Recent guideline anaesthesiology support placement epidural catheter concomitant administration UFH 5000 U two time day . However , guideline clearly support placement epidural catheter three time day regimen use , little data available ass risk practice . Older study ( 1973 ) suggest significant proportion patient ( 15 % ) develop abnormal partial thromboplastin time use three time day regimen . However , know result still consistent recent laboratory technology , compare twice daily heparin . In absence even basic data regard systemic effect coagulation , difficult time begin determine safe practice regard placement epidural catheter presence three time day UFH 5000 U regimen . This study design obtain data . Methods : As need standard anesthesia , surgical post-operative care , arterial line place keep first 24 hour postoperatively . Immediately prior first UFH dose hourly follow 24 hour , blood sample partial thromboplastin time collect arterial line . The first dose UFH give operate room anaesthesiologist . A blood sample partial thromboplastin time also collect 3 day follow first dose UFH .</detailed_description>
