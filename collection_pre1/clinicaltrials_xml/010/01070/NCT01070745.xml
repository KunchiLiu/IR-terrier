	<brief_summary>Patency ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) functionally essential fetal circulation , however persistence ductal patency postnatally may significant adverse hemodynamic effect neonate . Medical therapy PDA predominantly involve administration one two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug : indomethacin ibuprofen . Both therapy show successful mediating ductal closure approximately 70 % treated infant . However , need second course treatment PDA closure remain quite common . The investigator hypothesize , small difference two drug , great percentage infant respond first course therapy indomethacin respond second course ibuprofen repeat course indomethacin . As , investigator aim compare secondary therapy repeat course indomethacin secondary therapy ibuprofen infant whose ductus remain patent first course therapy indomethacin .</brief_summary>
