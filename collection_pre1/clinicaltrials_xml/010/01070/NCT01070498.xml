	<detailed_description>Food allergy major cause life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction . Currently avoidance allergenic food establish method prevent reaction allergic patient . This situation impact significantly live patient , mainly child , family . The current increase prevalence allergic disease , food allergy particular , Western world attribute part change life style . Before mid 20th century individual expose numerous bacterial , parasitic viral agent . Since time progress hygiene considerably reduce risk exposure agent . It think lack exposure , particularly childhood , lead subtle change human ' immune system result increased propensity develop allergic autoimmune response , so-called hygiene hypothesis . One mean revert propensity could exposure harmless biological agent . One agent , egg parasite Trichuris suis ( Trichuris suis ovum , TSO ) , show well tolerated efficient patient inflammatory bowel disease . This phase I study assess whether TSO safe adult child peanut tree nut allergy .</detailed_description>
