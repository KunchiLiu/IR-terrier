	<brief_summary>Energy-yielding fluid induce weak appetitive compensatory dietary response energy-matched semi-solids solid . This problematic high increase contribution energy beverage diet may enhance positive energy balance weight gain . The prevail view overweight/obesity problem stem small , sustained positive energy balance . It follow small change , perhaps manipulation rheological characteristic diet , required correct problem . Certain population prone weight gain may benefit manipulation . Obese individual higher beverage intake experience great weight loss reduction beverage intake . Further , evidence obese individual consume energy liquid pre-load lean counterpart , yet difference energy intake solid load . In contrast , habitual exerciser show increased accuracy short-term regulation food intake meal follow liquid preloads . A good understanding mechanism beverages energy-matched solid food form elicit differential appetitive dietary response population need . This research attempt identify influence physical fitness body fat ability compensate energy content solid liquid preloads reduction energy intake subsequent ad libitum meal ( i.e. , acute compensation ) course day ( i.e. , short-term compensation ) . Furthermore , study examine cognitive contribution differential response energy-matched beverage solid food form effect mastication appetite , GI transit , glycemic response , select endocrine response .</brief_summary>
