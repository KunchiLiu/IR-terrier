	<brief_summary>Poorly control hypertension ( HTN ) remain one significant public health problem United States , term morbidity , mortality , economic burden . Despite compel evidence support beneficial effect therapeutic lifestyle change ( TLC ) blood pressure ( BP ) reduction , effectiveness remains untested primary care practice , especially among minority patient share great burden HTN-related outcome include chronic kidney disease , stroke heart failure . This randomize control trial offer unique opportunity address gap literature . Among 200 hypertensive African-Americans receive care community- base primary care practice , test effectiveness culturally-tailored comprehensive therapeutic lifestyle intervention , deliver group-based counseling motivational interviewing ( MINT-TLC ) vs. Usual Care ( UC ) . MINT-TLC design help patient make appropriate TLC develop skill maintain change long-term . Patients MINT-TLC group attend weekly group class focus TLC 12 week ( intensive phase ) ; follow individual motivational interviewing ( MINT ) sessions 3 month ( maintenance phase ) . Trained research personnel deliver MINT-TLC appropriate treatment fidelity procedure . Patients UC condition receive single individual counseling session TLC print version intervention material . The primary outcome within-patient change systolic diastolic blood pressure baseline 6 month . Secondary outcome level target therapeutic lifestyle behavior ; proportion patient adequate blood pressure control 6 month</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We test effectiveness primary care practice-based comprehensive therapeutic lifestyle intervention , deliver group-based counseling motivational interviewing ( MINT-TLC ) two-arm , randomize control trial ( RCT ) 200 low-income , poorly control hypertensive African-American patient . MINT directive , participant-centered , counsel approach initiate maintain behavior change proven effective improve adherence various health behavior . We hypothesize among African Americans poorly control hypertension ( HTN ) , randomize TLC group , compare randomized UC , exhibit great reduction systolic diastolic blood pressure ( BP ) ; great level physical activity ; percent change weight ; increase intake fruit vegetable ; reduce 24-hour urinary sodium excretion 6 months.The primary outcome within-patient change systolic ( SBP ) diastolic ( DBP ) baseline 6 month . The secondary outcome level physical activity , percent change weight , dietary intake fruit vegetable , 24-hour urinary sodium excretion BP control rate 6 month . Blood pressure assess well-validated automated digital BP monitor ( BPTru ) , follow American Heart Association guideline . Therapeutic lifestyle behavior assess validated self-report measure : Dietary intake assessed NCI 's fruit/vegetable fat brief dietary assessment questionnaire ; physical activity assess Nurses Health Study Health Professionals Study 's physical activity questionnaire . Percent weight loss estimate difference weight baseline 6 month , 24-hour urinary sodium excretion use estimate dietary sodium intake . Patients categorize controlled BP average BP fulfill Seventh Joint National Committee Detection , Evaluation Treatment Hypertension ( JNC-7 ) criterion SBP &lt; 130 DBP &lt; 80 mmHg ( patient diabetes chronic kidney disease ) ; SBP &lt; 140 DBP &lt; 90 mmHg ( patient ) . Regardless group assignment , outcome data assess baseline , 3 month , 6 month .</detailed_description>
