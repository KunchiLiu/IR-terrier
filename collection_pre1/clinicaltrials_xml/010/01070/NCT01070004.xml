	<brief_summary>Sleep deprivation induces degradation night-time driving ability via sleepiness . Because conflict physiological need social professional activity , necessary develop affordable countermeasure sleepiness . In real-life driving study , nap coffee efficient countermeasures sleepiness wheel . However effect caffeine quick brief varies individual . There need knowledge order know recommend driver . Exposure 460-nm monochromatic light ( blue light ) decrease subjective sleepiness improve performance . One objective project investigate whether blue light exposure drive would useful real drive situation sleepiness become acute . Owing fact knowledge effect exercise drive sparse absolutely need standardize bout exercise apply subject . One objective present study investigate simulator study effect bout moderate exercise participant drive ability sleepiness become acute . Nocturnal neurobehavioral performance varies widely individual certain subject seem significantly affected sleep loss . It interest find biological marker sleep drive identify vulnerable driver sleep deprivation identify responder sleepiness countermeasure ( i.e. , coffee blue light ) . One objective study determine individual difference ( genetic , hormonal cognitive ) impairment drive skill induced sleep loss efficiency countermeasure ( blue light coffee ) .</brief_summary>
