	<brief_summary>Phase Ib part : ▪ Primary objective : To demonstrate recommend dose combination paclitaxel , gemcitabine , sunitinib ( sutene® ) ( PGS ) preoperative chemotherapy patient HER2-negative operable breast cancer - Secondary objective : 1 . To demonstrate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) regimen 2 . To determine safety profile Phase II part - Primary objective : To evaluate pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) preoperative administration PGS ▪ Secondary objective : 1 . To assess breast conserve rate preoperative PGS 2 . To evaluate clinical response rate , disease free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) 3 . To assess safety profile PGS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/II Study Primary Chemotherapy With Paclitaxel , Gemcitabine , Sunitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unlike adjuvant chemotherapy , primary ( preoperative ) chemotherapy shrink tumor allow patient become candidate conservative surgery avoid mastectomy . It also vivo chemosensitivity test result predictive marker clinical outcome . Paclitaxel show effective agent treatment breast cancer . Gemcitabine cytosine arabinoside prodrug analog show response rate 15 % 46 % single agent low toxicity . The combination paclitaxel gemcitabine ( PG ) result improvement objective response rate , time progression overall survival compare paclitaxel monotherapy patient metastatic breast cancer . In addition , primary chemotherapy PG PGH ( PG + trastuzumab ) show significant activity low toxicity phase II study perform National Cancer Center , Korea ( ASCO 2007 SABCS 2008 , respectively ) . Sunitinib oral small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor exhibit potent anti-angiogenic antitumor activity . Sunitinib rationally design small molecule inhibits member split-kinase domain family receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFs ) type 1 , 2 , 3 , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) -α , -β , stem cell factor receptor ( KIT ) , colony stimulate factor 1 receptor ( CSF-1R ) , Fms-like tyrosine kinase ( FLT-3 ) , glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor ( RET ) . Inhibition RTKs block signal transduction , thereby affect many process involve tumor growth , progression , metastasis , angiogenesis . Angiogenesis play vital role growth metastasis solid tumor . Preclinical indirect clinical evidence accumulate support role neo-angiogenesis pathogenesis progression breast cancer . Breast cancer neo-vascularization , measure increase microvessel density , correlate extent disease associate vascular invasion tumor , prerequisite blood-borne metastasis . VEGFR signal also implicate pathobiology breast cancer . Breast cancer patient exhibit high level circulate VEGF RTKs likely implicate breast cancer pathogenesis . Interestingly , phase II study ( Study A6181002 ) single-agent sunitinib ( 50 mg/d schedule 4/2 ) breast cancer patient anthracycline- taxane-refractory metastatic disease reveal response rate approximately 14 % 51 assessable patient , lead additional accrual . When sunitinib combine paclitaxel , significant activity notice tolerable toxicity profile phase I trial ( SABCS 2007 ) . Based trial , phase III trial paclitaxel sunitinib ongoing . In addition , phase I trials gemcitabine sunitinib combination ongoing . Based significant activity PG combination regimens neoadjuvant metastatic set phase I trials combination regimens sunitinib-paclitaxel sunitinib-gemcitabine , plan conduct phase IB/II study primary chemotherapy sunitinib , paclitaxel gemcitabine patient HER2-negative stage II/III breast cancer . The goal phase IB/II study define recommend dose maximum tolerable dose paclitaxel gemcitabine combination sunitinib , explore activity combination preoperative chemotherapy patient HER2-negative operable breast cancer .</detailed_description>
