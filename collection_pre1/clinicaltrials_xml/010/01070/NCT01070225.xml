	<brief_summary>Current therapy management asthma include inhaler . Types medication ( beta agonist ) , improve asthma symptom stimulate area ( receptor ) within human airway result dilation human airway . Whilst drug highly effectively immediate set longterm use , constantly stimulation receptor within airway associate increase asthma exacerbation rare case death . Conversely medication block receptor within human airway ( betablockers ) avoid asthma . The main reason possible acute airway narrow occur soon administration . However chronic use betablockers asthma recently show benefit reduce airway inflammation great importance improve asthma control reduce symptom . Despite early evidence support chronic use beta blocker asthma , concern 2 major regard : potential cause acute airway narrow ( irrespective longterm benefit ) possibility could block reliever action beta agonist . The objective study establish best reverse short term effect single dose beta blocker . This study design single centre study , participant attend department approximately 3 separate visit ( include screen visit ) approximately 1 weekly interval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversal Acute β-Blocker Induced Bronchoconstriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma originally think associate intrinsic defect β2- adrenoceptor function tip balance towards parasympathetic bronchoconstriction . While β2-agonists highly effective acute relief bronchoconstriction , chronic use accompany adaptive reduction β2ADR number associate desensitisation response , result increased exacerbation rare case death . Conversely chronic use β blocker show murine model reduce airway inflammation mucous metaplasia . Recent work human demonstrate potential benefit β blocker asthmatic demonstrate significant improvement airway hyperresponsiveness bronchial challenge1 . Despite early evidence support chronic use β blocker asthma , concern 2 major regard : potential cause acute bronchoconstriction ( irrespective long-term benefit ) possibility could block reliever action β-agonists . Sub-sensitivity β-adrenoceptors occurs follow treatment long-acting β-agonists . Previous work department show high dose steroid re-establish β-adrenoceptor function follow down-regulation2 . It therefore seem plausible similar response may occur follow β-blockade ( reverse β-blockade re-establishing β-agonist sensitivity ) . The investigator wish gather evidence best method treat β-blocked patient short term . The investigator therefore wish examine effect acute-β blockade low dose propranolol mild-to-moderate asthmatic . The investigator wish simulate airway stress rescue acutely β-blocked patient . For safety purpose investigator choose propranolol due short half-life 3 5 hour . Importantly ability achieve airway reversibility recovery follow acute β-blockade influence long term viability chronic β blocker use management asthma .</detailed_description>
