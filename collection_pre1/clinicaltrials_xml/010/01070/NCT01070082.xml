	<brief_summary>Pain associate procedure perform adult ICU patient ubiquitous subject research attention.While grow evidence prevalence , characteristic measurement procedural pain ICUs , evidence derive English-speaking patient United States able verbally report intensity distress pain . Frequently perform procedure include turn , chest tube removal , wound care/wound dress change , endotracheal suctioning , central catheter insertion ( arterial/venous , focus research . Other potentially painful procedure , include lumbar puncture physiotherapy , numerous systematically study adult . Patients unable verbally report pain able participate procedural pain study , limited generalizability study result narrow population ICU patient . The Specific Aims propose European-based , international study ICU patient undergo select procedure : - Describe patient self-reports pain intensity distress - Describe behavior exhibit patient procedure , compare behavior exhibit able versus unable self-report pain intensity pain distress - Examine predictor amount pain intensity , behavioral response , analgesic use related procedure gender , age , language speak , country , type hospital . Validated pain intensity , pain distress , behavioral observation instrument methodically translate predominant language speak international study site ; research training packet similar develop large , multisite study United States develop provide data collection site ; data collection occur 6-month period time .
