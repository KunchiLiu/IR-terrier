	<brief_summary>The primary goal study combination computerize asthma reminder system implementation guideline increase utilization adherence guideline-driven care , lead improve patient outcome . Hypothesis : An automatic , computerize reminder system detect asthma patient pediatric ED increase guideline adherence compare paper-based guideline . The specific aim study : Aim 1 : Develop , implement , integrate asthma guideline ED information system infrastructure . Aim 2 : Evaluate effect asthma detection system combine computerized guideline versus asthma detection system combine paper-based guideline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma lead chronic childhood disease affect 9 million child ( 12.5 % ) 18 year age ( 1 ) . Asthma exacerbation cause estimate 14 million missed school day ( 2 ) 1.8 million emergency department ( ED ) visit annually ( 2 ) , account &gt; 60 % asthma-related cost ( 3 ) . The chronic characteristic asthma carry considerable economic burden . Uncontrolled asthma lead exacerbation require patient seek immediate care , frequently ED set . Several asthma guideline , include nationally accept guideline National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) , exist support clinician provide adequate treatment . Utilization adherence asthma guideline improve patient ' clinical care ( 4 , 5 ) . However , guideline adherence remain suboptimal . In ED , early recognition accurate assessment severity airway obstruction response therapy fundamental improvement health patient asthma . The NHLBI guideline emphasize early recognition treatment asthma exacerbation , well appropriate treatment stratify severity . Computer applications patient care address barrier optimal medical care . Computer system improve use adherence practice guideline , provide clinical alert reminder , generate patient-specific treatment recommendation educational material . Implementation guideline-driven decision support frequently paper-based computerized . In either form major barrier remain busy clinician remember initiate guideline process embed guideline task clinical workflow care team ( 5 ) . The propose study examine benefit novel approach remind clinician ED set use guideline-driven care . The approach apply workflow-embedded process take advantage advanced information technology infrastructure . The informatics approach include two element : ) computerize , real-time reminder system , automatically detect guideline-eligible patient without require additional data entry , b ) computerize , workflow-embedded guideline implementation .</detailed_description>
