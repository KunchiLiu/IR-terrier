	<brief_summary>The use coronary angiography investigate patient risk coronary artery narrowing become universal . In case , investigation lead successful treatment plan revascularisation recommend appropriate . However substantial number patient , image take coronary artery lead diagnostic uncertainty . Increasingly , doctor use device call pressure wire clarify significance coronary artery narrowing order tailor patient treatment individual basis . The Radi pressure wire well recognise reliable tool assess whether narrow significant functional term , , significantly restrict blood flow heart muscle.It consist fine wire feed individual major coronary artery measure pressure within vessel . In conjunction image take artery , useful decide best treat patient . This study enroll volunteer investigate stable cardiac-sounding chest pain undergoing coronary angiogram . It investigate whether extra information gain pressure wire assessment change patient ' treatment plan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Routine Pressure Wire Assessment Influence Management Strategy Coronary Angiography Diagnosis Chest Pain ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The choice management individual patient determine largely presence distribution significant coronary narrowing . Usually , significance judge visual estimation narrow angiogram . However , although standard way assess coronary narrowing , widely publish pressure wire measurement accurate ass true physiological consequence narrow . Interventional cardiologist frequently use Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR ) measurement help decide artery require stenting.The hypothesis study routine measurement FFR main coronary artery could provide diagnostic information beyond obtain angiogram alone . This additional information may well affect choice management proportion patient . For example , narrow consider significant angiographically may show insignificant FFR , vice versa . Background Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) major cause morbidity mortality United Kingdom . It account approximately half cardiovascular relate death annually , accord statistic British Heart Foundation , CAD relate expenditure £3,500 million 2003 alone . Much effort place improve method detect assess severity CAD facilitate rapid appropriate management CAD patient . Once diagnose , CAD may treat 3 way : ( 1 ) tablet alone , ( 2 ) tablet plus angioplasty stent ( 3 ) tablet plus coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) . The method choice depend primarily extent severity disease time coronary angiography . Coronary angiography current conventional method diagnosis CAD use assessment disease severity . For angiographic procedure , vascular access secure via femoral artery radial artery route dye inject coronary artery blood vessel . The progress dye coronary blood vessel provide visual assessment narrowing present coronary artery . Where thought significant flow obstruction , particularly symptomatic patient , one three treatment offer . While coronary angiography revolutionise management CAD , procedure without limitation . The purely visual assessment disease severity coronary angiography subjective patient management depend cardiologist review film . Many narrowing grade 'moderate ' severity decide whether haemodynamic significance notoriously difficult angiography alone . In recent year , Radi pressure wire show provide accurate physiological haemodynamic data coronary narrowing . Furthermore , FFR measurement derive predicts clinical outcome , hence give 'cut−off ' measurement severity disease correlate requirement revascularisation either stent surgery . Thus FFR frequently use clinical practice interventional cardiologist decide narrowing require treatment . However , majority diagnostic angiography UK perform non−interventional cardiologist currently access pressure wire technology . In study , speculate measure FFR routinely main coronary artery patient undergo coronary angiography FFR data obtain may affect angiogram−derived management patient term choice tablets/stents/CABG . For example , narrowing look significant angiographically may haemodynamically important FFR vice versa . Clearly could make difference revascularising patient . Research Aims To evaluate : 1 . The degree correlation standard angiographic assessment coronary artery pressure wire assessment main artery . 2 . To determine whether FFR data would influence management strategy patient derive basis angiogram ( represent clinical practice ) . Methods Design The study recruit 200 patient list diagnostic coronary angiography perform non-interventional cardiologist . Methodology 1 : In Catheter Laboratory - All patient receive information sheet initial invitation take part . - Written inform consent obtain . - Patients undergo coronary angiography routine manner . - The non-interventional cardiologist charge patient 's care analyse picture grade outcome manner show table 1 . He/she formulate management plan consistent routine clinical practice independent subsequent pressure wire data . This management plan document CRF . He/she take part procedure . Table 1 1 . Are significant stenosis ( &gt; 70 % eyeball ) major epicardial vessel ( i.e . main coronary branch &gt; 2.25mm ) 2 . Recommend revascularisation medical/conservative treatment 3 . If revascularisation : recommend strategy referral ( Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) CABG ? ) vessel ( i.e . LAD + RCA etc ) represent target revascularisation - The management strategy record accord follow option : 1. medical ; 2 . PCI 3 . CABG - Data also collect regard vessel target ( i.e . vessel require stent/graft ) - If non-interventional cardiologist make plan allocate patient fourth category `` data require '' . Such patient generally refer non-invasive stress image even pressure wire . - FFR measurement undertaken consultant interventional cardiologist - Additional screening time contrast use accrue FFR measurement record . - The patient give 70units/kg heparin i.a . i.v . prior passage pressure wire - A pressure wire introduce distal third patent major epicardial coronary artery branch &gt; 2.25mm TIMI 3 flow . - FFR measurement take use either intracoronary intravenous adenosine accord local conventional practice operator preference . - The protocol mandate i.v . adenosine ostial LM stem ostial RCA stenosis . - Where i.c . adenosine bolus employ , minimum data require study : 1 baseline FFR without adenosine 2 bolus least 50mcg adenosine . - An angiogram acquire first adenosine measurement document satisfactory engagement guide catheter position measurement vessel - The minimum FFR reading take case - FFR reading &lt; 0.8 consider represent haemodynamic significance per FAME protocol - Once FFR data derive procedure finish haemostasis achieve normal manner - Provided angiogram-derived management plan record CRF FFR data reveal non-interventional cardiologist . The management plan record light FFR data use category dataset previously . - The non-interventionalists manage patient see fit Analysis PRIMARY ENDPOINT Estimation number case FFR data result change management strategy revascularisation strategy ( number vessel require treatment and/or PCI v medical v CABG ) Potential Clinical Value If study prove hypothesis , suggest coronary angiography would well support routine pressure wire assessment order tailor revascularisation strategy individual patient accurately . The result study carry important clinical implication study hypothesis proven ... . least term potential patient benefit . The current widely hold practice diagnostic test follow either ( ) referral revascularisation , ( ii ) case equivocal angiographic result , referral stress image look objective evidence ischaemia follow referral revascularisation positive could render obsolete diagnostic angiography perform interventional cardiologist FFR availability ability perform PCI sit appropriate . The study may generate hypothesis routine FFR measurement benefit patient also cost-effective would fewer intervention overall ( ie less CABG + PCI ) few expensive intervention ( i.e . le CABG versus PCI ) ?</detailed_description>
