	<brief_title>Everolimus ( RAD001 ) Therapy Epilepsy Patients With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) genetic disorder incidence birth 1 6000 . This disorder characterize development benign tumor multiple organ system , include brain . The primary neurological manifestation TSC epilepsy , mental retardation autism . Epilepsy common , occur 80-90 % patient , often seizures severe , unremitting , uncontrolled current anticonvulsant medication . It generally accept seizure arise cortical subcortical tuber surround tissue brain . These tuber cause mutation tumor suppressor gene TSC1 TSC2 . The protein product gene , hamartin tuberin , act negative regulator PI3K/PKB ( Akt ) /mTOR signal pathway regulates cell growth proliferation Everolimus immunosuppressant drug also inhibit mTOR signal capable reverse aberrant mTOR-dependent effect occur hamartin tuberin absent defective . Thus , hypothesize drug like everolimus may therapeutically useful treatment refractory epilepsy patient TSC .</detailed_description>
