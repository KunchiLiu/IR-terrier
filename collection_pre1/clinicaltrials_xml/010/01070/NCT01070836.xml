	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate incidence progressive multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) natalizumab-treated participant detectable antibody John Cunningham virus ( JCV ) ( antibody negative ) low participant detectable antibody JCV ( antibody positive ) . The secondary objective study : Estimate incidence PML natalizumab-treated participant anti-JCV antibody negative anti-JCV antibody positive , base meta-analysis data obtain study data source ; Define prevalence anti-JCV antibody relapse multiple sclerosis ( MS ) participant receive natalizumab within TYSABRI Outreach : United Commitment Health ( TOUCH ) Prescribing Program ; Determine change anti-JCV antibody status time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>JC Virus Antibody Study Participants With Relapsing Forms MS Receiving Treatment With Natalizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No treatment provide observational , longitudinal cohort study . Study population consist United States ( US ) participant relapse MS receive commercial natalizumab . There study-mandated visit . Serum sample collect routine patient care follow-up visit send central laboratory analysis ( presence anti-JCV antibody ) , remain serum aliquot store future natalizumab PML research . Additional sample collect participate site participant qualify consent participate focus sample group ( participant anti-JCV antibody positive time point AND receive â‰¥12 infusion natalizumab , whether history immunosuppressant use ) . These sample store future natalizumab PML research .</detailed_description>
