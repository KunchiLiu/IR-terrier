	<brief_summary>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( ABPM ) potentially offer superior way screen child entry antihypertensive trial , assure true hypertension enrolled.10 In addition , ABPM offer well method measure response drug therapy.11-16 The ABPM device commonly use child ( Spacelabs 90217 - Issaquah , Washington ) independently validate use population . In 1993 , British Hypertension Society ( BHS ) publish protocol validate ABPM device , include guidance validation study children.17 More recently , Working Group Blood Pressure Monitoring European Society Hypertension publish revision guideline , include child update.18 Unfortunately , original BHS protocol suggest use small group child protocol outline adult . Since BP child variable adult , guidance unlikely adequate child . Hence , large , stringent validation study need conduct cohort child use method similar use validate device adult . Performance propose validation study need allow incorporation ABPM clinical trial design anti-hypertensives child ultimately allow accurate identification hypertensive population determination response therapy along allow assessment chronobiologic profile drug response dose interval.9</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The diagnosis treatment hypertension remain challenge child adolescents.1 At present diagnosis make medical encounter depend randomly applied auscultatory oscillometric techniques.2 These measurement influence multiple factor include diurnal variation , stress related effect ( notably fact measurement perform physician 's office clinic ) , observer bias measurement process . In addition , standard approach provide little information regard blood pressure variability patient ' ambient environments.3,4 If diagnosis hypertension make , lifestyle change often prescribe . In child adolescent recommendation meet mixed result often frustrate patient family well caregiver . In case , sufficient concern exist regard long-term health end organs heart , kidney , eye brain , pharmacotherapy recommend . Unfortunately , instance drug prescribe little information guide proper , age-related dose safety assessment . In study conduct last decade half agent market adult hypertension fail demonstrate sufficient activity child adolescents meet regulatory requirement labeling.5 While significant amount apparent ambiguity appear related design study assess efficacy safety drug pediatric patient , perhaps significant problem study determination actually hypertensive first place . This supplement address issue directly introduce innovative approach diagnosis hypertension child adolescent . Once validate , ambulatory BP monitoring may use describe model chronobiological pattern blood pressure among patient recently diagnose hypertension use standard clinical criterion . This unique opportunity ass treatment na√Øve patient compare innovative new approach currently gold standard . The current project design specifically validate use ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) child adolescent may use clinical tool unambiguously make diagnosis hypertension patient population use guide pharmacotherapeutic intervention . The use ABPM child first document 19916 subsequently employ child young 2 month age . Despite adjunctive use 60 % pediatric nephrologists North America , device currently use majority pediatric practice research center never validate pediatric population . In contrast , ABPM become world-wide standard monitoring blood pressure adult suspect hypertension . It offer advantage multiple measurement dynamic process protract period time permit evaluation diurnal pattern nocturnal disease . It also offer distinct advantage monitor patient natural environment without observer bias permit objective assessment apparent drug resistance hypotensive event might occur therapy . Finally , ABPM measurement demonstrate well correlate cardiovascular morbidity mortality casual measurements.7 They also correlate end organ damage children.8 Performance propose validation study need allow incorporation ABPM clinical trial design related diagnosis treatment hypertension child . ABPM ultimately allow accurate determination response therapy asses chronobiologic profile drug response dose interval . Of device currently market , Spacelabs 90217 offer range cuff size require pediatric population . Thus , monitor validate .</detailed_description>
