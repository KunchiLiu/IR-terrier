	<brief_title>Treatment Efficacy Toxicity Rheumatoid Arthritis Database Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) common inflammatory arthritis , affect ~1 % US population . Severity RA vary mild synovitis joint destruction associate disability increase mortality . Methotrexate ( MTX ) major drug use treat RA anchor drug clinical trial investigational new drug ( INDs ) RA . Eight biologic agent currently FDA-approved RA . No drug effective every patient , great variability toxicity price . The use concomitant MTX biologic agent dramatically improve outcome RA treatment US . This proposal base premise next major advance need treatment RA additional drug , rather dramatic improvement efficiency cost-effectiveness use drug individual patient RA . One hop modern medicine realization `` personalize '' medicine , allow accurate , quick prediction drug efficacious , least toxic , least expensive individual patient . One major obstacle identify clinically useful marker treatment response RA lack cohort prospectively collect treatment response data couple biological sample . Because importance issue paucity funding effort , multiple effort establish single institution ( use institutional fund ) multisite cohort repository ( typically dependent private practitioner pharmaceutical company support ) plan . To date , attempt harmonize effort US academic RA research community create public resource . Recognizing building de novo cohort within short time frame feasible , current proposal fill critical need : establishing infrastructure academic investigator lay foundation future collaborative large-scale registry ; unite effort many organization common goal improve care RA patient . This project facilitate future research result significant , publicly visible improvement health care . Identifying predictor treatment response RA lead rapid , early institution optimal drug rather `` hit miss '' sequential approach ; reduce adverse event ; improve patient compliance ; lead substantial reduction cost health care . By unify effort academic researcher , create unique resource , bank cryopreserved blood cell allow sophisticated immunologic research dissect molecular signal successful treatment RA . In order determine feasibility infrastructure prospectively collect data sample enroll small number participant ( 10/site/year 2 year , total 200 participant ) .</detailed_description>
