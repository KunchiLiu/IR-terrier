	<brief_summary>Patient 's protocol type blood cell cancer , blood disease genetic disease receive stem cell transplant . The donor stem cell either brother sister , another relative , closely match unrelated donor . The patient ask participate study test blood cell donor grown special way , prevent effective treatment early infection three virus - Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) adenovirus . Adenovirus virus usually cause symptoms common cold , cause serious life-threatening infection patient weak immune system . It affect lung cause serious pneumonia , also damage gut , liver , pancreas eyes.CMV also cause serious infection patient weak suppressed immune system . It usually affect lung , cause serious pneumonia , also affect gut , liver eye . Approximately 2/3 normal people harbor virus body . In healthy people CMV rarely cause problem immune system keep control , transplant , risk develop CMV disease much high immune system weak . EBV virus cause glandular fever . It also life long infection like CMV normally control immune system . When immunity weak , virus become active cause fever , enlarge lymph node sometimes type cancer call lymphoma . Investigators want see kind white blood cell call T lymphocyte ( T cell ) use prevent treat adenovirus , CMV EBV early stage reactivation infection . T cell grown patient 's stem cell donor laboratory way train recognize virus control give transplant . This treatment specially trained T cell ( also call CTLs ) activity viruses previous study study investigator want see still activity make simpler faster way . These donor-derived multivirus-specific special cell line investigational product approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study evaluate whether donor-derived multivirus-specific special cell line safe control three virus : EBV , CMV adenovirus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood previously take patient donor make cell . To make special cell line , special blood cell call dendritic cell ( DCs ) make first donor blood . Then , specially produce gene call plasmid carry adenovirus , CMV , EBV gene introduce dendritic cell . Dendritic cell new gene mixed T cell stimulate . This stimulation train donor T cell kill cell infect CMV , EBV , adenovirus . Once sufficient number T cell make , tested make sure kill patient 's cell infected virus , patient 's normal cell , frozen . If donor never infect CMV , CTLs make patient may activity CMV infection . If donor CTLs show activity CMV infection , cell give . The patient may receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) . Then , donor 's special cell thaw injected patient 's intravenous line . After patient receives cell , level three virus patient 's blood monitor . Investigators also take blood see long T cell give patient last patient 's body . If special cell infusion help infection patient treatment ( example steroid drug ) might destroy T cell give , patient allow receive 2 dos cell . The patient continue follow his/her transplant doctor injection . The patient either see clinic contact research nurse follow study every week 6 week 8 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month . The patient may visit standard care . The patient also regular blood test do follow count viral infection . To learn way T cell work patient 's body , extra 30-40 ml ( 6-8 teaspoon ) blood take infusion 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week 3 month . Blood come central intravenous line , require extra needle stick . Total time participation study 1 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients eligible follow type allogeneic transplant receive CTLs prophylaxis early reactivations define . 1 . Prior myeloablative nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use either bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell . 2 . Prophylaxis patient risk CMV , adenovirus EBV infection ( Phase 2 portion ) . In phase 1 portion patient must meet criterion 3 . 3 . Early treatment reactivation infection define virus : 1 . CMV : CMV antigenemia monitor least weekly post transplant . Early reactivation define CMV antigenemia le 10 leucocyte positive . If patient develops CMV antigenemia ( great 10 leukocyte positive ) clinical evidence CMV infection ( define demonstration CMV biopsy specimen visceral site ( culture histology ) either pre CTL infusion , standard treatment Ganciclovir , and/or Foscarnet Immunoglobulins initiate . Patients may receive CTLs antigenemia elevate PCR without visceral infection . 2 . Adenovirus : Adenovirus infection define presence adenoviral positivity detect PCR culture ONE site stool blood urine nasopharynx . Adenovirus disease define presence adenoviral positivity detect culture two site stool blood urine nasopharynx . In patient meet criterion disease Cidofovir may add unless subject could tolerate agent due nephrotoxicity . Patients may receive CTLs elevate PCR blood stool . 3 . EBV EBVLPD define accord recent guideline proven EBVLPD define biopsy probable EBVLPD define elevate EBV DNA level associate clinical symptom ( adenopathy fever mass image ) without biopsy confirmation . Patients EBV DNA reactivation define EBV DNA level &gt; 1000 copies/ug may also receive CTLs study . Patients proven probable EBVLPD also receive Rituxan 4 . Early treatment may give eligible patient single multiple infection . Patients multiple infection one reactivation one control infection eligible enroll . 5 . Patient CMV seronegative donor may receive CTLs CMV reactivation dose escalation phase line activity CMV . 6 . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid le 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone . 7 . Karnofsky/Lansky score 50 great 8 . ANC great 500/ÂµL . 9 . Bilirubin 2x upper limit normal less 10 . AST 3 x normal less 11 . Serum creatinine 2 x upper limit normal less 12 . HgB &gt; 8.0 13 . Pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air 14 . Available multivirusspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes 15 . Negative pregnancy test female patient applicable ( childbearing potential receive reduced intensity condition regimen ) . 16 . Written inform consent and/or sign assent line patient , parent guardian . DONOR ELIGIBILITY : The donor CTL product donor donate allogeneic product patient 's transplant . These donor allogeneic ( i.e . HLA match mismatch related unrelated ) stem cell transplant fulfil eligibility consent stem cell donation per stem cell transplant program 's standard operating procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion Criteria initial CTL subsequent infusion : 1 . Patients receive ATG , Campath immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibody within 28 day screen enrollment . 2 . Patients uncontrolled infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . 3 . Patients receive donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) within 28 day . 4 . Patients active acute GVHD grade IIIV . 5 . Active uncontrolled relapse malignancy .</criteria>
