	<detailed_description>Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia ( PCD ) severe genetic disorder cause various mutation gene affect ciliary motility . While diagnosis PCD Israel currently base part electron microscopy ( EM ) detection ciliary ultrastructural defect , technique may unsatisfactory overcome inherent heterogeneity . Thus , late under-diagnosis suboptimal characterization patient common . Various new complementary diagnostic technique , include measurement nasal nitric oxide ( NO ) , Video Microscopy ( VM ) , Immunoflourescence ( IF ) genetic analysis recently recognize simpler accurate modality diagnosis characterization patient PCD . While consider rare disease worldwide , PCD prevalent among highly consanguineous population , find Israel . Given rarity case particularly familial one , useful implementation new diagnostic technique require multicenter collaboration . We hypothesize use modern state art novel test modality national scale Israel improve diagnosis , improve phenotypic-genotypic correlation create national registry PCD . We propose perform multicenter study whose aim : - To characterize complex phenotype genotype PCD Israel , use state-of-the-art novel diagnostic technique . - To create national registry patient family PCD Israel - To develop robust national standard diagnosis evaluation , lead good early diagnosis , treatment counseling .</detailed_description>
