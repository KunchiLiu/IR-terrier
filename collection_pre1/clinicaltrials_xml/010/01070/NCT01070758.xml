	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety Lanreotide Autogel child CHI already treat Octreotide pump . Patients method . Congenital hyperinsulinism ( CH ) genetic disorder characterize dysregulated insulin secretion result persistent hypoglycemia . Identification prompt management patient essential , patient expose recurrent hypoglycemic episode increase risk developmental disorder . Many patient treat somatostatin analog Octreotide administer continuous infusion use pump . This treatment may pose huge burden stressful patient family demand intensive daily care . In effort simplify daily care patient improve quality life study efficacy safety Lanreotide Autogel ( Lan-ATG ) - long-acting somatostatin analog administer injection month . This trial include child CH , treat Octreotide pump . We believe child old 2 year old benefit therapy . At age , parent encounter technical problem pump , child prone play pump take needle . It 's also difficult place child day care , need continuous follow . The dose Lan-ATG calculate accord surface area patient . The dose use adult usually 60 mg adapt patient 's dose accord body surface area also accord daily dose Octreotide use pump . The start dose 40 mg/mÂ² . The patient gradually wean pump follow first injection Lan-ATG ( 10 % decrease every 3-4 day total month ) . Every patient serve his/her control . The following examination do every child : 1 . Continuous blood glucose monitoring 72 hour glucosensor , exclude asymptomatic hypoglycemia - 6 month . 2 . Growth velocity every 3 month . 3 . Bone age year . 4 . Routine laboratory test ( biochemistry , CBC thyroid function test ) every six month . 5 . Biliary US 6 month . During follow try expand distance injection , base knowledge patient CH know enter remission age 4-5 year .</detailed_description>
