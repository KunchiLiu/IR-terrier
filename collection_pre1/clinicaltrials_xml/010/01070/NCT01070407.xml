	<brief_summary>HCV001 Phase I study ascertain safety immunogenicity novel vaccine Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . The vaccine base sequential delivery , intramuscular route , two different adenoviral vector , human chimpanzee origin respectively , bear genetic information HCV antigens ( NS region ) . The two recombinant vector , call Ad6NSmut AdCh3NSmut , weaken unable multiply within body ; design induce immune response HCV proteins . Although Ad6NSmut AdCh3NSmut never give human trial , promise result obtain non-human study . The HCV001 study design explore different prime-boost regime concern dose , order interval administration Ad6NSmut AdCh3NSmut .</brief_summary>
