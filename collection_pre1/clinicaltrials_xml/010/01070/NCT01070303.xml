	<detailed_description>Study M02-433 design evaluate efficacy safety adalimumab maintenance clinical remission patient Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . The study consist 2 phase : 1. 1-year phase ( Week 0 Week 56 ) ( NCT00055497 ) consist randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled portion concomitant open label ( OL ) portion , 2. long-term open-label extension ( OLE ) phase ( NCT01070303 ) last 264 additional week ( Week 56 Week 320 ) . Participants complete lead-in study NCT00055523 , eligible participate rollover study , NCT00055497 . 176 participant document complete Year 1 ( NCT00055497 ) ; however , 177 participant still receive study drug evaluate Week 56 NCT00055497 ; participant include OLE data ( NCT01070303 ) . At Week 4 NCT00055497 , participant demonstrate clinical remission ( define Crohn 's Disease Activity Index [ CDAI ] score &lt; 150 point ) Baseline NCT00055497 remain clinical remission Week 4 ( `` Remitters '' ) randomize receive 1 3 blind treatment : placebo , adalimumab 40 mg every week ( eow ) , adalimumab 40 mg every week ( ew ) . Participants demonstrate clinical remission Baseline NCT00055497 longer clinical remission Week 4 NCT00055497 ( `` Non-remitters '' ) assign receive OL adalimumab 40 mg eow . All study drug ( placebo active ) administer subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . At time Study NCT00055497 , participant receiving blind study drug develop disease flare could switch OL adalimumab 40 mg eow . A participant receiving OL adalimumab 40 mg SC eow develop flare non-responders could his/her dose increased 40 mg SC ew . After 1 year ( Week 56 NCT00055497 ) , patient still participate could continue OLE phase ( NCT01070303 ) . Participants receive blind study drug switch OL adalimumab 40 mg SC eow , participant receive OL study drug continue previous OL adalimumab dose ( adalimumab 40 mg SC eow ew ) . Data summarize Remitters Non-remitters , exception data primary reason noncompletion . Summaries primary reason noncompletion available participant , Remitters Non-remitters .
