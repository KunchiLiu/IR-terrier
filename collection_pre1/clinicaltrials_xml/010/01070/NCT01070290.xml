	<brief_title>A Study ARQ 197 Versus Investigator 's Choice Second-Line Chemotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer Who Have Progressive Neoplastic Disease Following Treatment With One Prior Chemotherapy Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label randomized phase 2 study design evaluate PFS ARQ 197 versus investigator 's choice second-line chemotherapy patient unresectable ( locally advance metastatic ) gastric carcinoma progressive neoplastic disease follow treatment prior regimen consist least two drug 5-FU , cisplatin docetaxel . Patients randomize ARQ 197 arm investigator 's choice arm 1:1 ratio . The study also evaluate efficacy safety parameter include ORR , OS adverse event two treatment arm . Patients assign investigator 's choice arm may receive one following : - Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 i.v . every two week ( cycle = 4 week ) - Capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 p.o . twice daily 14 day follow 7 day therapy every 3 week ( cycle = 3 week ) - Irinotecan 125 mg/m2 i.v . weekly 4 week follow 2 week therapy every 6 week ( cycle = 6 week ) Treatment continue unless one treatment discontinuation criterion meet . Dose reduction occur base current label investigator choice agent . Patients randomly assign ARQ arm receive 120 mg ARQ 197 twice daily ( 240 mg/day ) throughout treatment period . The treatment ARQ 197 continue unacceptable toxicity , document progression disease , another discontinuation criterion meet . A cycle ARQ 197 treatment define 21 day cycle may repeat every 3 week ( 21 day ) base toxicity response . The assigned treatment continue unacceptable toxicity , disease progression ( clinical radiological ) another discontinuation criterion meet . Tumor evaluation : Tumor evaluation perform 6-week 8-week interval . Tumor response evaluate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Progression-free survival : The time disease progression-free calculated date randomization disease progression per RECIST death due cause . Patients alive progression free censor date last tumor evaluation . Overall response rate : The ORR calculate intent treat patient population number patient confirm complete response partial response divide number randomize patient . Overall survival : Overall survival time calculated date randomization death due cause . Safety assessment : Data vital sign , physical examination , adverse event , serum chemistry , hematological laboratory test , electrocardiograms collect . Based data irinotecan , estimated median PFS second-line chemotherapy arm 4 month . In order demonstrate improvement median PFS 5.5 month ( 37.5 % improvement , hazard ratio 0.73 ) base two-sided log rang test , 338 patient ( 169 per arm ) require , assume 18 month enrollment 12 month follow-up , alpha 0.05 90 % power . The sample size assume 10 % loss follow-up rate . A futility analysis perform 33 % event require final analysis occur Independent Data Monitoring Committee . The futility boundary describe full statistical analysis plan study .</detailed_description>
