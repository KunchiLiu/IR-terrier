	<detailed_description>Early detection melanoma critical favorable prognosis , since patient earlier stage melanomas much high probability survival later stage . The traditional method early detection serial total body skin exams health care provider examines skin surface , include mucosa , suspicious pigment lesion . Studies demonstrate diagnostic accuracy physician melanoma depend level dermatological training . More important able make diagnosis melanoma clinical impression ability make appropriate decision biopsy lesion . Primary care physician ( PCPs ) often expect screen melanoma refer dermatologists high clinical suspicion melanoma . However , PCPs adept diagnose melanoma , opportunity early diagnosis treatment could miss . Conversely , morphology benign pigment lesion often mimic early melanoma , result potentially unnecessary dermatology referral , biopsy , patient anxiety . Studies indicate great variability ability PCPs make correct decision biopsy/refer pigment lesion ( 1.5 time great dermatologist ) well diagnose melanoma ( 2.5 time great dermatologist ) . To aid detection early melanoma , new technology develop . One technology MelaFind , investigational device develop give recommendation biopsy ( ) pigment skin lesion rule melanoma . Our hypothesis MelaFind equal good sensitivity pigment lesion expert make appropriate recommendation biopsy ( i.e. , MelaFind least accurate dermatologist recommend biopsy melanoma ) .</detailed_description>
