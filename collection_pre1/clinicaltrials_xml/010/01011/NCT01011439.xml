	<detailed_description>The Simon 's optimal 2 stage design adopt single-arm , open-label , multicentre phase II clinical trial PHA-848125AC administer patient recurrent metastatic , unresectable thymic carcinoma previously treat chemotherapy ( one prior systemic therapy allow ) . The intent study assess antitumor activity PHA-848125AC ultimately improve outcome patient thymic carcinoma already exploit one chemotherapy option . The primary end point study progression free survival rate 3 month .</detailed_description>
