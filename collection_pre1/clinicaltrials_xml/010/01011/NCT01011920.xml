	<brief_summary>This multicenter open label randomize phase II trial . Enrolled Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma ( PCNSL ) patient stratify accord IELSG score randomize receive one follow primary chemotherapy : - Arm A : Methotrexate ( MTX ) + Cytarabine ( Ara-C ) - Arm B : MTX + Ara-C + rituximab - Arm C : MTX + Ara-C + rituximab + thiotepa . Chemotherapy administer every three week . The maximum number chemotherapy induction course 4 . Patients Stable Disease ( SD ) good two course receive two course primary chemotherapy regimen . Stem-cells harvest perform three arm second course . After 4 course response assessment perform . Patients achieve SD well 4th course , well experience Progressive Disease ( PD ) time achieve sufficient stem cell harvest , receive Whole Brain Radiation Therapy ( WBRT ) 36-40 Gy +/- tumor bed boost 9 Gy . Patients achieve SD well 4th course stratify accord objective response primary chemotherapy primary chemotherapy regimen randomly allocate receive consolidation therapy one follow : - Arm D : WBRT 36 Gy +/- boost 9 Gy - Arm E : Carmustine ( BCNU ) + Thiotepa + Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant ( APBSCT ) Patients Complete Response ( CR ) WBRT APBSCT remain follow-up . Patients achieve CR WBRT manage accord physician 's preference . Patients achieve CR APBSCT refer WBRT .</brief_summary>
