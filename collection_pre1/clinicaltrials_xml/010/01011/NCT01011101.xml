	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study human able move eye remember region even target disappear . The ability suggest brain keep track eye look , without external target continue reference . This call corollary discharge . - Other research indicate patient schizophrenia might difficulty monitor eye movement . The corollary discharge process may defective patient schizophrenia , perhaps delayed time . Researchers develop test examine possibility hope learn schizophrenia eye movement . Objectives : - To assess whether defect internal monitoring eye movement patient schizophrenia . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age able give inform consent able concentrate 20-minute task involve follow project target move eye remember location . - Individuals schizophrenia recruit ongoing NIH protocol study schizophrenia . - In addition healthy recruit protocol . Design : - Researchers check participant ' vision eye , ask sit machine measure eye movement order complete research task . Researchers monitor participant ability complete task . - The first task involve simply follow target jump different part screen . - The second 2-step task , participant ask look two separate light target look remembered target position light . - This protocol provide treatment . Participants remain care physician participation protocol .</brief_summary>
