	<brief_summary>Background : - Infections cause virus common cause illness : common cold , many ear infection , sore throat , chicken pox , flu cause different virus . Usually , illness last day , , week . Some virus infection like influenza clear body , others chicken pox virus remain body inactive state . However , people may become quite ill infect particular virus , possibly part immune system respond properly fight virus . - Researchers discover reason person may able clear infection cause virus . Some person change gene involve immune system result inability properly control infection particular virus . Identifying change gene involve immune system help scientist well understand immune system work protect people infection may help develop new therapy . Objectives : - To study possible immune defect may link particular severe viral infection . - To determine identify immune defect genetic origin . Eligibility : - Individuals age diagnosis virus infection physician consider unusually severe , prolonged , difficult treat . - Relatives participant severe viral infection may also participate study . We use blood and/or skin specimen try determine identify immune defect hereditary . Design : - Prior study , participant 's doctor give researcher detail infection , along medical record review . Eligible participant invite NIH Clinical Center full evaluation outpatient inpatient . - At Clinical Center , participant treat best available therapy particular viral infection , researcher monitor infection responds treatment . - Researchers take intermittent blood sample conduct test ( skin biopsy ) evaluate immune system . - During illness , researcher conduct follow-up visit determine course infection response therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Severe Viral Infections Characterization Immune Defects Patients Without Known Immunocompromise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Viral infection normal host usually self-limited innate acquire immune system mount successful antiviral response . However , instance , apparently immunocompetent person manifest infection virus would otherwise observe severely immunocompromised host . For example , case herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) encephalitis , esophagitis orgastritis , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) colitis , adenovirus hepatitis pneumonitis , recurrent persistent skin infection cause HSV varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) , severe wart cause human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , recurrent respiratory papillomatosis cause HPV , severe influenza respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) due JC polyomavirus describe apparently immunocompetent patient . While variety case report describe severe viral infection immunocompetent host , pathogenesis vast majority case understood , therapy unsuccessful . In protocol , evaluate patient without know immunocompromise , severe , persistent , treatment-refractory viral infection cause herpesviruses , adenovirus , polyoma virus , papillomaviruses , viral infection . We investigate whether certain host virologic factor predispose individual severe disease . We also determine usefulness various microbiologic test ( e.g. , culture , serology , molecular assay ) follow course infection patient . The physician Clinical Center provide optimal therapy patient , part standard care . Identification virologic host factor predispose patient severe viral infection may important implication elucidate pathogenesis infection development novel therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ( Participants ) Participants must meet follow inclusion criterion order participate study : 1 . Children adult ( regardless age ) without know fully define immunodeficiency definitively diagnose severe viral infection , include infection cause herpesviruses ( HSV1 , HSV2 , CMV , EBV , VZV , HHV6 , HHV7 , HHV8 ) , human papillomavirus ( e.g. , severe recalcitrant wart ) , adenovirus , polyomavirus ( JC virus BK virus ) , influenza virus . Viral infection would consider `` opportunisticlike '' , herpesvirus esophagitis , herpesvirus encephalitis , CMV colitis , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( cause JC polyoma virus ) , particular interest protocol . OR Children adult welldocumented prior , severe , persistent , treatment refractory viral infection ( ) , clinically recovered viral infection within past year . If patient able visit NIH evaluation , personal physician may mailin blood clinical specimen NIH analysis possible immune defect analysis virus mutation , indicate . 2 . Ongoing care refer physician . 3 . Willingness allow storage blood tissue sample future analysis . ( Relatives ) Relatives ( 2 year ) may recruit establish genetic origin immune defect may identify study subject . We may obtain blood , buccal swab skin biopsy relative . 1 . Males females accept . 2 . Adult relatives guardian minor relative must willing capable providing inform consent review protocol procedure describe consent form , appropriate study team member . 3 . Participating relative agree blood store future study immune system . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants meet follow exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation : 1 . Patients previously diagnose condition associate immunodeficiency ( e.g. , history HIV infection positive test HIV ) patient condition require either daily systemic corticosteroid exceed dose equivalent to10 mg/day prednisone significant immunosuppressant therapy ( e.g. , organ stem cell transplant recipient ) . Note : Patients include treatment steroid immunosuppressive medication begin reduce disease associate infection institute AFTER viral disease begin . 2 . Women pregnant . 3 . Any condition major comorbidity study investigator believe compromise patient 's ability comply requirement study .</criteria>
