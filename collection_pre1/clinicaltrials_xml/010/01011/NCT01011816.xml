	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation establish safety efficacy Biostat System use treatment chronic low back ( lumbar ) pain due symptomatic internal disc disruption ( IDD ) compare safety efficacy outcome measure one group receive BIOSTAT BIOLOGX® Fibrin Sealant Biostat® Delivery Device another group receive preservative-free normal saline control deliver Biostat Delivery Device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Symptomatic Lumbar Internal Disc Disruption ( IDD ) With Biostat® System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Biostat System combination product combine resorbable biologic product delivery device system use prepare insert biologic material lumbar intervertebral disc . Symptomatic IDD define painful disruption internal architecture lumbar intervertebral disc , appear fissure , crack tear within internal structure disc . Pain arise lumbar disc may perceive pain locate low back ( axial pain ) also somatic refer pain involve posterior hip , buttock , lateral hip , groin , posterior thigh . The diagnosis symptomatic IDD currently make basis imaging study , physical examination , symptoms alone , best establish meticulously conduct disc provocation study ( provocation discography ) include pressure manometry identification adjacent normal disc . This treatment study design patient exhibit potential source chronic low back pain advance degenerative disc disease significant loss disc height ( &gt; 33 % ) , spinal stenosis , spondylolisthesis ( see Eligibility Criteria ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 old skeletally mature . Voluntarily sign subject inform consent form agree release medical information purpose study ( HIPAA authorization ) . Physically mentally able comply protocol , include ability read complete require form , willing able adhere followup requirement protocol . Chronic low back pain least 6 month . Pretreatment baseline low back pain least 40 mm 100 mm visual analog scale . Pretreatment baseline RolandMorris Disability Questionnaire score least 9 24point questionnaire . Leg pain , present , nonradicular origin , i.e. , due stimulation nerve root dorsal root ganglion spinal nerve compressive force . Leg pain , present , extend knee great 50 % low back pain measure visual analog scale . If bilateral leg pain , worst leg pain great 50 % low back pain . Low back pain unresponsive least 3 month nonoperative care , may include bed rest , antiinflammatory analgesic medication , chiropractic manipulation , acupuncture , massage , physical therapy homedirected lumbar exercise program . Diagnostic medial branch block facet joint injection 18 month 2 week prior study procedure indicate facet joint involvement . Diagnosis symptomatic lumbar ( L1L2 L5S1 ) internal disc disruption ( IDD ) , require confirmation discogenic pain one two contiguous level positive provocation discography perform 18 month 2 week prior study procedure use pressure manometry identification adjacent nonpainful disc . The disc provocation study must precisely demonstrate concordant pain ( &lt; 50 psi opening pressure ) must demonstrate fissure ( ) outer onethird posterior lateral anulus . Cauda equina syndrome . Active malignancy tumor source symptom . Current infection prior history spinal infection ( e.g. , discitis , septic arthritis , epidural abscess ) active systemic infection . Previous lumbar spine surgery . Evidence prior lumbar vertebral body fracture . Disc bulge/protrusion focal herniation symptomatic level ( ) &gt; 4 mm . Presence disc extrusion sequestration . Leg pain great 50 % low back pain measure visual analog scale . Leg pain extend knee . Lumbar intervertebral foramen stenosis affect level ( ) result significant spinal nerve root compression ( effacement majority periganglion fat loss CSF signal around nerve rootlet ) . Symptomatic central vertebral canal stenosis absolute sagittal vertebral canal diameter &lt; 9mm . Loss disc space height symptomatic level ( ) great onethird adjacent normal disc ( expect height case L5S1 disc ) . Spondylolisthesis ( &gt; Grade 1 ) without spondylolysis symptomatic level ( ) . Lumbar spondylitis undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy . Dynamic instability symptomatic level ( ) lumbar flexionextension radiograph indicate &gt; 4.5 mm translation angular motion &gt; 15° L1L2 , L2L3 , L3L4 ; &gt; 20° L4L5 ; &gt; 25° L5S1 . Diagnostic medial branch block facet joint injection indicate facet joint involvement . Diagnostic sacroiliac injection indicate sacroiliac joint involvement patient pain sacral region . Sustained relief ( &gt; 3 month ) low back pain obtain epidural injection corticosteroid . Symptomatic involvement two lumbar disc level determine discography . Neurological examination show finding radiculopathy significant underlying neurological condition ( motor strength &lt; 4 ; sensory assessment abnormal ; reflex absent hyperactive clonus ) . Prior thermal intradiscal procedure ( e.g. , intradiscal electrothermal therapy , intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation ) . Any lumbar intradiscal injection procedure discography ( e.g. , injection corticosteroid , methylene blue , dextrose , glucosamine chondroitin sulfate ) . Significant systemic disease , include unstable angina , autoimmune disease , rheumatoid arthritis , muscular dystrophy . Congenital acquire coagulopathy thrombocytopenia ; currently take anticoagulant , antineoplastic , antiplatelet , thrombocytopeniainducing medication ; undergo radiation therapy . History unexplained , easy , persistent bruise bleeding , bleed gum , bleed problem experience previous surgical procedure . Aspirin aspirincontaining medication take ≤ 7 day prior procedure . Known suspected hypersensitivity allergy drug component fibrin sealant ( fibrinogen , thrombin , aprotinin , CaCl2 ) use procedure . History , current psychiatric psychological condition , substance alcohol abuse would potentially interfere subject 's participation study . Ongoing previous participation another drug device clinical study within previous 2 month . Subject know pregnant nursing time enrollment plan become pregnant within planned length followup . Body habitus precludes adequate fluoroscopic visualization procedure procedure physically impossible use device . Concomitant condition require daily oral steroid use 30 day precede 90 day . Pending litigation health care professional , except require insurer condition coverage , personal injury compensation litigation claim . Prisoner active military personnel would available followup . Presence ferromagnetic implant would disallow MRI symptomatic disc ( ) . Active pending worker ' compensation claim .</criteria>
