	<brief_summary>This study involve use investigational vaccine . A vaccine medicine cause body make antibody . Antibodies help destroy foreign substance enter body . The purpose study find right dose new vaccine safe produce good immune response ( well body recognize defend harmful foreign substance ) . There two Staphylococcus aureus toxoid ( component antigens ) investigation study ; one protein know rAT protein know rLukS-PV . They develop see effective prevent infection cause bacteria Staphylococcus aureus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Staphylococcus Aureus Toxoids Phase 1-2 Vaccine Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Staphylococcus aureus lead cause skin soft tissue infection . Antibiotic resistance , see new community-acquired methicillin-resistant strain , present major challenge treat prevent infection . Therefore , preventative vaccine consider potentially good approach . This study assess safety immunogenicity monovalent bivalent S. aureus vaccine component . Healthy adult subject randomize receive 1 dose monovalent bivalent toxoid vaccine , placebo dose escalation schedule . Antigen-specific antibody measure ELISA serum collect three month injection . Safety data collect 7 day reactogenicity diary injection , adverse event Staphylococcus aureus skin soft tissue infection collect Day 84 , serious adverse event chronic illness collect full 6 month study period . To evaluate possible utility booster dos , cohort receive high dose bivalent antigen 2nd dose administer Day 84 , new 7-day reactogenicity diary serum collect 2nd dose . All subject follow 6 month phone call vaccination booster . The total subject observation period 24 week Day 0 , plus 12 additional week cohort receive 2nd dose . With recruitment period 4 month , study duration expect approximately 13 month .</detailed_description>
