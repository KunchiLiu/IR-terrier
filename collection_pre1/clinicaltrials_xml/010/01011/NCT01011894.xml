	<brief_summary>The purpose study : Determine likelihood lenalidomide adequately control disease least one year . Lenalidomide drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental . The lenalidomide administer study commercially market product . Although expect similar safety activity commercially market drug , possible difference may exist . Because commercially market drug , lenalidomide administer patient enrol clinical trial may administer direction physician investigator clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients either previously untreated treated disease must either intermediate highrisk chronic lymphocytic leukemia define threestage Rai system . Patients Rai intermediate risk disease meet criterion active disease outline NCI Working Group guideline ( include weight loss , fatigue , fever , evidence progressive marrow failure , splenomegaly , progressive lymphadenopathy , progressive lymphocytosis rapid doubling time ) ( 49 ) . MSKCC pathologist must confirm patient 's disease . To consider CLL patient must absolute lymphocytosis blood least 5,000 lymphocyte per microliter , bone marrow lymphocytosis great equal 30 % nucleated cell Immunophenotypic ( immunohistochemical ) analysis malignant lymphocytes demonstrate cell Bcells . Typically cell also express CD5 CD23 . It recognize occasional patient CLL may slightly aberrant immunophenotype . All case need review principal investigator prior register study .
