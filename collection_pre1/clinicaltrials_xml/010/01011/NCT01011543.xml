	<brief_summary>This randomise study compare different diagnostic approach diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis patient suspect pulmonary tuberculosis three classic ( non-induced ) sputum sample n't show tuberculous bacillus direct examination . The investigator compare sensibility induce sputum technique endoscopic approach ( CT-scan follow BAL fluoroscopy-guided transbronchial biopsy eventually sputum collection immediately bronchoscopy ) . People high risk population tuberculosis undergo screen chest X-ray symptomatic patient admit hospital chest X-ray show suspicion active tuberculosis . According good clinical practice : ( non-induced ) sputum sample take admission every follow morning . If direct examination PCR first three classic sputum sample negative : patient randomise two group different diagnostic approach ( induced sputum versus endoscopic approach ) The aim study proof thoroughgoing endoscopic approach high sensibility induce sputum diagnosis pulmonary tuberculosis patient high suspicion active tuberculosis chest X-ray negative direct examination and/or PCR three consecutive normal sputum sample . The investigator include 154 patient ( base statistical analysis hypothesis endoscopic approach sensibility 's twice sensibility induce sputum ) . - first arm : 2 consecutive induce sputum use ultrasonic nebulizer . - second arm : CT thorax evaluate exact anatomic localisation disease follow fluoroscopy-guided bronchoscopy BAL ( bronchoalveolar lavage ) transbronchial biopsy . A sputum sample immediately endoscopy collect possible .</brief_summary>
