	<detailed_description>Methamphetamine ( MA ) abuse fast grow drug problem United States responsible significant public health complication , include HIV infection1 . As result effective treatment MA dependence urgently need . There currently efficacious medication MA dependence , although result preliminary randomized trial bupropion MA dependence find bupropion effective placebo , among subgroups participant , include low frequency MA use baseline 2 , 3 . A grow body preclinical clinical study suggest cholinergic mechanism play important role neurobiology MA stimulant dependence , nicotine dependence 4 . Mechanistically , cholinergic medication may alleviate MA-associated cognitive dysfunction , thereby improve outcome treatment MA dependence 5 . Varenicline partial agonist α4β2 nicotinic receptor full agonist α7 nicotinic receptor approve anti-cigarette smoking medication . In order ass potential efficacy varenicline methamphetamine dependence , perform clinical trial ass follow aim : 1 . To determine varenicline result significantly great reduction methamphetamine use placebo , determine via proportion methamphetamine-free urine specimen provide participant throughout treatment , provide methamphetamine dependent participant conjunction cognitive behavioral therapy . Exploratory Aim 1a . To determine whether reduction methamphetamine use varenicline versus placebo great among methamphetamine dependent participant baseline light MA use ( MA use 18 few past 30 day baseline ) versus heavy MA use ( MA use 18 past 30 day ) . Exploratory Aim 1b . To determine varenicline result great proportion methamphetamine dependent participant achieve methamphetamine abstinence define self-reported MA abstinence , confirm via urine drug screen ( available urine drug screen MA-metabolite free least one urine drug screen available per week two miss visit urine drug screen ) final two week study medication period ( week 7 8 ) relative placebo provide conjunction cognitive behavioral therapy . 2 . To determine varenicline result significantly great treatment retention placebo among MA dependent participant provide conjunction cognitive behavioral therapy . To address aim , recruit 20 MA dependent participant randomize receive treatment varenicline ( n=10 ) placebo ( n=10 ) 8 week , combination cognitive behavioral therapy , follow 4 week follow observation . Results study potential provide additional safety data yield preliminary evidence may support fully power late Phase II trial efficacy varenicline treatment methamphetamine dependence . Findings also potential provide insight influence cognitive dysfunction , medication potential cognitive enhancing effect , pathogenesis MA dependence treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
