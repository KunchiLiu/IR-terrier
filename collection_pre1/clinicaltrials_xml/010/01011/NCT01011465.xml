	<brief_summary>Positive social relationship consistently associate good health , although neurobiological underpinnings observe effect remain largely unknown . The overall goal propose work explore novel biological pathway may explain social relationship influence health . Recent theorize suggest oxytocin system may underlie observed beneficial effect . Four hypothesis examine : 1 . Oxytocin ameliorate deleterious neuroendocrine , cardiovascular , subjective effect stress . 2 . Oxytocin social support similar additive stress-buffering effect . 3 .

	<detailed_description>Positive social relationship consistently associate good health , although neurobiological underpinnings observe effect well understood . Valuable insight may gain life course perspective become increasingly apparent early life social experience crucially relate later life function well-being . The overall goal propose work explore novel biological pathway help explain social relationship influence health . Recent theorize biology relate positive social emotional factor health pattern resilience suggest oxytocin system may underlie observed beneficial effect . Historically , work oxytocin system human tie reproductive outcome ( e.g. , lactation ) , limited work child young adult . A grow body experimental research animal suggest early life , oxytocin creates powerful social bond mother child may also stimulate growth restorative process well buffer deleterious stress-related neuroendocrine activation throughout life course . Moreover , animal literature suggest oxytocin potent presence high estrogen level , lead investigator hypothesize effect oxytocin strong woman men , study test hypothesis human . A good understanding inter-relationships oxytocin , social relationship , stress , health gain examine factor control laboratory setting . The immediate goal research determine whether oxytocin play critical role determine neuroendocrine , cardiovascular , subjective response stress across age gender , examine effect oxytocin relation social support . To achieve goal , experimental research propose examine effect exogenously administer ( intranasal ) oxytocin psychological physiological outcome , condition stress . The specific aim exploratory project test follow hypothesis : 1 . Oxytocin ameliorate deleterious neuroendocrine , cardiovascular , subjective effect stress . 2 . Oxytocin social support similar additive stress-buffering effect . 3 . Effects oxytocin strong woman versus men . 4 . Effects oxytocin similar across range younger old adult age . Hypotheses test via placebo-controlled double blind study use sample healthy men woman recruit community ( overall n = 320 ) . The propose experimental study consider oxytocin effect range outcomes . These include autonomic reactivity measure blood pressure responses high frequency heart rate variability ( measure vagal tone ) . Stress-related cardiovascular phenotype characterize pattern ventricle contractility , vascular resistance , cardiac output also assess . Other outcome include measure neuroendocrine effect measure level cortisol dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) hormone , subjective distress positive affect . Participants randomly assign receive either exogenous oxytocin placebo . They undergo social stress manipulation without social support ( randomly assign ) , outcome measure obtain multiple time experimental procedure . The experiment test whether effect oxytocin social support similar additive , also compare effect oxytocin social support across men woman vary age . This multidisciplinary study use biobehavioral framework examine interaction psychological , social , biological level function , informed theory key early life exposure may impact health life course . The provision R21 award work facilitate novel research could major impact understand whether oxytocin influence response stress human . The proposed exploratory research lay groundwork submission R01 grant proposal great resource address question address limited mechanism well new question undoubtedly arise . Ultimately expect project provide solid platform launch large program research aim identify positive social emotional experience influence adult health longevity . A neurobiological understanding resilience inform effort prevention intervention diseases problem common later life .</detailed_description>
