	<brief_summary>The investigator use intradermal capsaicin injection forearm induce state localize pain . This localized pain measure different mean , analyse locally distally call quantitative sensory test . The primary endpoint measure difference pain perception without benzodiazepines/GABA-Agonists around injection point capsaicin . The secondary endpoint measure pain modulation locally distally different quantitative test electricity , pressure pain threshold , ice water test . The investigator ' hypothesis clobazam induce high pain threshold placebo less sedation control medication clonazepam .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Neuropathic nociceptive pain link plastic change central nervous system . These lead low pain threshold . An important component neuronal plasticity diminish inhibition-control neuron level spine , alpha-3 subunit glycine receptor play important role . Modulation receptor subunit specific non-specific GABA-Agonists produce antinociception . The new fact , subunit specific medication induce sedation animal . The relationship pain modulation Gaba-Agonists well study human . The benzodiazepine use pain therapy human clonazepam , induces strong sedation , reason much use chronic pain setting . Clobazam another GABA-Agonist , less sedative . To knowledge effect pain modulation never study human . Objective The aim analysis description clobazam central pain mechanism . We use well know quantitative sensory test method therefore . The primary objective gather data potential clinical use clobazam pain therapy . The secondary aim would test new specific alpha-3 agonist , develop pharmaceutical industry . Methods Quantitative sensory test make elicit area hyperalgesia forearm capsaicin . The area hyperalgesia around injection point primary issue study . The medication give patient cross-over , double blind randomize administration clobazam , clonazepam ( positive control ) tolterodine ( active placebo ) . Quantitative sensory test make study medication administration . The quantitative sensory test consists area hyperalgesia around capsaicin injection point , pressure pain elicit electronic pressure algometer , ice-water test hand , single multiple electrical skin muscle stimulation , pressure-cuff algometry side effect administer medication psychomotor test . Before start study protocol patient blood sample drawn genetic test different cytochrome subunit ( CYP P450 2C19 , 3A4 ) .</detailed_description>
