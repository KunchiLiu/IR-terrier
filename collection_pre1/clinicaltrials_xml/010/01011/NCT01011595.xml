	<brief_summary>The gold standard technique assess extent disease decide therapy patient lung cancer consist cervical mediastinoscopy , surgical procedure entail incision neck removal lymph node around airway . Endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) new , non-surgical technique available past several year prove invaluable lung cancer evaluation . These technique minimally invasive perform without surgery . To date , head-to-head study group patient use old new technique . The study consist study compare traditional stag technique lung cancer patient new , less invasive technique . The significance propose project tremendous . If new strategy prove equivalent ( superior ) traditional technique , technique consider new gold-standard test . This change way lung cancer evaluate . An equivalent superior result also significantly impact patient care , cost morbidity due speed , convenience lack operating room requirement well lack general anesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Problem : The gold standard technique stage diagnose mediastinum patient lung cancer consist cervical mediastinoscopy ( CM ) . CT , PET PET-CT scan improved radiological staging mediastinum ; however techniques unable provide tissue diagnosis inaccurate . Endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) available past year prove invaluable diagnosis stag mediastinum . These technique rely image mediastinal lymph node ( LN ) airway ( EBUS ) esophagus ( EUS ) use miniaturize ultrasound probe mount tip flexible bronchoscope ( EBUS ) esophagoscopes ( EUS ) . Once LN visualize identify use either technique , needle pass airway ( EBUS ) esophageal ( EUS ) wall LN biopsy perform . These minimally invasive trans-luminal technique require general anesthesia perform safely , rapidly , accurately low cost . Due cost , inconvenience risk associate traditional surgical mediastinal diagnosis staging , many physician forego tissue diagnosis mediastinum , result incomplete pre-operative staging patient . The endoscopic technique quickly replace traditional technique center ; however , replace gold standard test new modality , one must first prove equivalence safety efficacy . Until study complete , compel data able offer technique equivalent alternative patient . The propose project first head-to-head comparison endobronchial ( EBUS ) endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) addition transluminal biopsy gold standard invasive surgical stag technique diagnosis stag NSCLC . 2 . Objectives : - Define compare sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , likelihood ratio accuracy traditional minimally invasive mediastinal diagnostic staging technique lung cancer . - Compare morbidity , convenience , cost efficiency traditional minimally invasive diagnostic strategy . - Examine impact decision regard change treatment plan ( neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , prevention thoracotomy ) base minimally invasive mediastinal staging compare conventional staging strategy . 3 . Methodology : The study design consist prospective comparison diagnostic test finding consecutive case series subject serve control . In order , enroll N subject ( N=166 ) , subject subject K procedure ( K=3 ) . One procedures , `` traditional '' one ( K-1 ) , consider gold standard comparison . We compare diagnostic finding K-2 K-3 alternative procedure ( EBUS EUS , respectively ) gold standard across N subject . We compare singly combination gold standard . All patient new suspected diagnosis lung cancer prospectively enrol study . All patient undergo standard mediastinal staging , EBUS EUS operate room , one procedure . Patients include study meet one follow criterion : ( A ) Lung lesion mediastinal lymphadenopathy and/or positive PET scan mediastinum , ( B ) Lung lesion without mediastinal lymphadenopathy positive PET scan mediastinum . Sample size calculate 166 patient . Results traditional staging technique consider `` gold standard '' test mediastinal diagnosis staging . These test use standard modality combination modality compare . Data collect analyzed whole ( patient mediastinal LN sampling ) separately base pre-biopsy diagnosis , post-biopsy diagnosis , mediastinal LN size ( CT scan ) , LN station PET avidity . Sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , likelihood ratio accuracy calculate use compare EUS EBUS ( transluminal strategy ) traditional staging , EUS EBUS , EUS traditional staging EBUS traditional staging . Subanalysis base pre-biopsy patient imaging ( CT PET ) characteristic well ultrasound image characteristic biopsy use develop predictive model minimally invasive mediastinal diagnosis , order well define patient increase decreased likelihood successful diagnosis use technique . ROC curve construct used discriminate result diagnostic test . The primary focus project hypothesis sample size calculation design around whether minimally invasive trans-luminal mediastinal LN biopsy accurate traditional `` gold standard '' technique diagnosis stag mediastinum . Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value accuracy calculate strategy ( minimally invasive traditional ) compare . Receiver operate curve use compare two strategy differ sensitivity 1-specificity value . Relative operating characteristic curve use compare two strategy different true positive false positive rate . The study estimate complete three year . Sample size calculation determine 166 patient require study . The thoracic surgery division CHUM estimate accrual approximately 1.5 patient per week ( 6 patients/month ) . 4 . Expected Results : We expect find minimally invasive mediastinal LN stag diagnosis equivalent term accuracy traditional staging strategy , actually superior . This superiority possible , secondary additional LN basins accessible via technique .</detailed_description>
