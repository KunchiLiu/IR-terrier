	<brief_title>Muscle Derived Cell Therapy Bladder Exstrophy Epispadias Induced Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder exstrophy patient undergone primary bladder closure , bladder capacity low bladder neck reconstruction ( Group 1 ) , limited additional surgical option permit urethral void urine storage within native bladder . Previous study demonstrate positive correlation bladder capacity success bladder neck reconstruction . Likewise , patient undergone bladder neck reconstruction continue urinary incontinence ( Group 2 ) also face limited option . Often , group consider augmentation cystoplasty closure bladder neck require intermittent catheter void surgically construct continent catheterizable channel . Such major reconstruction significant associate short long-term morbidity . Endoscopic injection MDCs treatment urinary sphincter insufficiency potential alternative therapy patient . By increase outflow resistance rhabdosphincter contractility , MDC injection may permit efficient bladder cycle bladder expansion Group 1 patient allow proceed bladder neck reconstruction . This increase resistance sphincter contractility may allow Group 2 patient attain urinary continence avoid reconstructive surgical procedure . Eligible consented patient would undergo rectus muscle biopsy immediately transfer Cell Therapy Lab tissue process MDC expansion.The MDC expansion process take approximately 21 day cell harvest cryopreserved future injection.Each vial fill cell concentration approximately 2.0 x 107 cells/ml . At time plan MDC injection , enrol patient return cystoscopy anesthesia . At time , aliquot MDCs remove freezer allow thaw passively 30 minute precede time plan injection . MDC product endoscopically injected use FDA approve DEFLUX™ needle level external urethral rhabdosphincter bladder neck . Patients would assess toxicity adverse event postoperatively day 1 40 follow semiannual visit 36 month . variable measure : group 1 : Bladder capacity , detrusor leak point pressure , bladder filling pressure , post-void residual urine volume , urodynamics , periurethral electromyographic activity , renal - Bladder Ultrasound , cystoscopy . Group 2 : Detrusor leak point pressure , bladder filling pressure , maximum cystometric capacity , post-void residual urine volume , periurethral electromyographic activity , 24 hour pad / diaper weight assessment , void diary include incontinence grade maximum daytime dry interval , renal - Bladder Ultrasound , cystoscopy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Group 1 Males female least 2 year age : Classic bladder exstrophy successful primary , secondary , delayed primary closure subsequent epispadias repair . Cystography do 90 day precede participant identification least 12 month successful bladder closure demonstrate bladder capacity less 60cc . 2 . Group 2 Males female great 5 year age : Classic bladder exstrophy successful primary , secondary , delayed primary closure subsequent epispadias repair . Previous bladder neck reconstruction . At time participant identification , urinary incontinence define leakage urine night leakage urine interval le 3 hour daytime persist least 2 year bladder neck reconstruction . 3 . Screening labs obtain less 30 day prior MDC injection meeting follow criterion : Urinalysis urine culture demonstrate either bacterial growth growth organism treat appropriate oral antibiotic 7 day preoperatively . Participants positive urine culture urinalysis urine culture repeat completion antibiotic prior MDC injection . A negative urine culture must demonstrate prior MDC injection . Serum creatinine normal range age ( Infant : 0.20.4 mg/dl ; Child 0.30.7 mg/dl ; Adolescent 0.51.0 mg/dl ) . Negative Study Donor Virology Panel ( Hep B surface antigen , HIV 1 / 2 antibody , Hep B core antibody , RPR , HTLV I / II antibody , Hep C antibody ) . This panel do screen process repeat study followup . 4 . Parent legal guardian , opinion investigator , reliable willing make patient available duration study willing follow study procedure unit policy . 5 . Parent legal guardian able complete sign inform consent document . 6 . Negative pregnancy test sexual active female teenager . If able conceive sexually active , participant must agree use barrier contraceptive time study enrollment 6 month last MDC injection . Male participant able conceive sexually active must agree use protection well time study enrollment 6 month last MDC injection . 1 . Urodynamic study demonstrate severe uninhibited bladder contraction . 2 . Severe urethral bladder neck stricture demonstrate screen cystoscopy cystogram 3 . Cystography time screen demonstrate Grade IV vesicoureteral reflux ( highgrade reflux dilation renal pelvis blunt fornix ) Grade V vesicoureteral reflux ( Grade IV finding plus loss papillary impression ureteral tortuosity ) . 4 . Any degree renal scarring time screen demonstrate DMSA MAG3 renal scintigraphy presence grade vesicoureteral reflux ( VUR ) 5 . Renal ultrasound demonstrate Society Fetal Urology Grade III hydronephrosis ( widely split renal pelvis , renal calices uniformly dilate , parenchymal thin ) Grade IV hydronephrosis ( Grade III dilation plus parenchymal thinning ) . See Appendix D. 6 . Previous injection bulk agent level bladder neck ( bovine collagen DEFLUX™ ) 7 . Positive urine culture resistant preoperative oral antibiotic therapy 8 . Need chronic pulse steroid history congenital acquire condition result immunocompromise 9 . Previous adverse reaction anesthesia</criteria>
