	<brief_summary>A novel technique identify unspecified sleep apnea develop . This technique use signal typical acquire bedside monitor find critical care environment . Those signal process sleep analysis algorithm provide Apnoea Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) score . This study intend determine whether prevalence sleep disorder breathing identification among patient Coronary Care Unit ( CCU ) use novel approach significantly different use routine technique .</brief_summary>
