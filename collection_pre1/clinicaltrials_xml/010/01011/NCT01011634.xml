	<brief_summary>In United States , majority first-trimester surgical abortion perform outpatient clinic utilize wide variety oral intravenous regimen pain control . The specific aim study evaluate equivalency intravenous moderate sedation ( fentanyl 100 mcg midazolam 2 mg ) versus oral analgesia/anxiolysis ( lorazepam 2 mg sublingual , hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/500 mg , ibuprofen 800 mg ) first-trimester surgical abortion . The investigator hypothesize oral moderate sedation intravenous moderate sedation equivalent control pain measure difference +/- 10 100-point ( range 0-100 ) visual analog pain scale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Intravenous Oral Moderate Sedation First Trimester Surgical Abortions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50 % pregnancy United States unintended 50 % end induced abortion . In 2000 , approximately 1.31 million abortion perform United States , approximately 88 % less 12 week gestational age . There movement toward perform elective abortion ambulatory care set ; however provide dilemma term procedural anesthesia . In fact , general anesthesia induce abortion associate increase incidence complication death.5 The paracervical block ( PCB ) alone show reduce pain cervical dilation tenaculum placement . Slower injection great volume associate great pain control , possibly related effect tissue distension well nerve blockade.6,7,8 However , woman 's perception pain continue significant PCB alone . A majority high-volume first trimester provider ( abortion clinic ) offer intravenous moderate sedation . However , many individual practitioner limit ability provide outpatient moderate sedation , research show mixed result efficacy . There continue dilemma term constitute optimal anesthesia first trim abortion maximize pain control minimize side effect duration hospital/clinic stay patient . A randomized , double blind , placebo control trial intravenous fentanyl ( 50-100 mcg ) local anesthesia versus placebo local anesthesia alone 368 participant find fentanyl , compare placebo , reduce pain first trim abortion 1.0 point 11-point verbal numerical scale . The investigator conclude pain reduction questionable clinical significance less study participant desire ( 2.0 point ) . Another randomize , double blind , placebo control study 100 participant compare local anesthesia alone local anesthesia intravenous fentanyl ( 25mcg ) midazolam ( 2mg ) first trim suction curettage . There statistically significant difference pain score group . However , patient receive intravenous sedation report increased satisfaction abortion procedure.11 There evidence good pain control oral sublingual analgesia . Preliminary data study perform UCSF Mt . Zion Women 's Options Clinic 11/04 12/05 ( Meckstroth H10873-25519 ) 120 woman undergo first trimester abortion receive sublingual lorazepam , ibuprofen , cervical block reveal 84.5 % patient report pain acceptable procedure 4.8 % consider pain level unacceptable 10.7 % unsure . Considering barrier abortion access , develop adequate medication regimen require monitoring expense moderate sedation could helpful encouraging provider offer abortion . . Given many patient pay directly abortion , increase cost service prohibitive many woman . Oral medication may also appeal patient seek sedation fearful needle . We hope demonstrate pain adequately control sublingual lorazepam oral ibuprofen- ideal medication clinic setting . Currently , standard care SFGH Women 's Option Center moderate sedation IV fentanyl midazolam . We conduct randomize control trial evaluate moderate sedation vs. sublingual lorazepam , oral ibuprofen , hydrocodone/acetaminophen ass pain control satisfaction patient undergo first trimester abortion . Both group receive local cervical block analgesia . The propose study randomize , double-blind , control trial conduct San Francisco General Hospital ( SFGH ) Women 's Options Center evaluate equivalency intravenous moderate sedation ( fentanyl 100 mcg plus midazolam 2 mg ) vs oral analgesia/anxiolysis ( lorazepam 2 mg sublingual , hydrocodone/acetominophen 5/500 mg , ibuprofen 800 mg ) first trim surgical abortion . The study participant derive SFGH Women 's Options Center . On average , SFGH Women 's Options Center perform 2200 abortion per year , 50 % first trimester , intravenous moderate sedation currently standard pain control regimen , utilize nearly 100 % procedure . In SFGH 's sister clinic Mt . Zion Planned Parenthood Golden Gate affiliate , various regime oral analgesia/anxiolysis utilized instead . Both consider standard care early abortion locally nationally .</detailed_description>
