	<brief_summary>Goal : The investigator propose test whether give supplement coenzyme Q10 ( Q10 ) improve symptoms subjective health Gulf War veteran ( GWV ) chronic , multi-symptom health problem . Rationale : Direct empirical evidence , group GWV , support benefit Q10 many symptom GWV heighten risk experience - fatigue , muscle pain , cognition , syndrome-defining condition . In addition , Q10 also report benefit symptom arise increased rate GWV , include headache , sleep disturbance , breathe problem . This provide strong rationale test whether Q10 similar benefit symptom GWV . Method : 46 GWV chronic health problem participate.The design randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study . Each subject `` crossed '' Q10 identical placebo , receive agent twice , 3.5 month period . In one Q10 phase , low dose Q10 use - 100mg three time day ; one high dose use - 300mg three time day . Neither subject investigator know substance subject receive phase . Subjects randomly assign one four crossover order . Assessments : Assessments include subjective quality life ; symptom `` syndrome defining '' Gulf War illness ( like fatigue muscle problem ) ; symptoms condition report occur commonly GWV ( like sleep problem ) . Analyses show whether Q10 lead improvement compare placebo ; whether high Q10 dose improve outcome low dos ; whether people certain symptom characteristic get benefit people symptoms characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Goal : To determine , via double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study , whether coenzyme Q10 ( Q10 ) administration reduces symptom improve subjective health Gulf War veteran ( GWV ) . Rationale : In number setting , study report benefit Q10 fatigue , muscle pain cognition , `` syndrome '' define symptom GWV . It also report improve range symptom condition arise increase rate GWV . Additionally Q10 defend mechanism may play role health problem GWV . For reason , study evaluate benefit Q10 symptom quality life symptomatic GWV merit . Subjects : 46 GWV meeting Center Disease Control ( CDC ) Kansas criteria `` Gulf War illness . '' Design : Randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind crossover study . Intervention : Coenzyme Q10 100mg three time day ( tid ) 300mg tid match placebo 3.5 Â± 0.5 month period . Primary Outcome : Subjective health ; syndrome define symptom ( fatigue , muscle pain , muscle strength ; cognition ) . Secondary Outcomes : A variety secondary outcome assess include symptom report elevated GWV ; marker oxidative stress ; dose-response . Analyses : Nonparametric secondarily parametric analysis compare effect Q10 v placebo ; high dose v low dose Q10 primary secondary endpoint . Possible effect modification ( differential benefit ) base factor oxidative state Q10 serum concentration explore regression analysis .</detailed_description>

To aid specificity , criterion involve CDC criterion Veterans ask symptom several general category ( e.g. , respiratory , gastrointestinal , neuropsychological , sleep disturbance , pain ) , well symptom ( e.g. , fatigue , headache ) single category apparent . Gulf War illness criterion symptom must persist recurred year prior interview first problem respondent 1990 later . Full criterion delineate Steele 2000 . Willing agree defer initiate counter medication till completion study participation . Willing defer participation clinical trial till completion study participation . If female childbearing potential , willing two form birth control study participation . Any factor might compromise participation full duration study . Known active cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) , neurodegenerative disease , HIV . Active medical problem distinct Gulf War symptomatology confer significant probability hospitalization , medication change , change clinical state course participation . Use coumadin .
