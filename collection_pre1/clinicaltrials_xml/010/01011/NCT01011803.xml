	<brief_summary>Swallowing implies appropriate use sufficient function specific muscle also use speech . Theoretically , muscle functionally affect phonation vocalization impair , well . The purpose study examine relationship function speech risk aspiration define swallow function , investigate diagnostic potential function speech may predict risk aspiration . This could allow early stratification ICU patient aspiration risk . Aspiration pneumonia report 20 % patient health care-associated pneumonia . There multiple tool ass risk aspiration ICU , yet time consuming , often delay involve advanced testing perform certified speech-language pathologist and/or radiologist . A novel 3-step phonetic evaluation create implemented ICU patient risk aspiration , result correlate standard swallowing test . If strong correlation find pilot study , formal clinical trial follow confirm simple bed-side phonetic evaluation could allow early identification patient risk aspiration , efficient management relative time resource utilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aspiration define entry solid liquid material respiratory tract , vocal fold , inhalation fume vapor . Aspiration pneumonia infectious process cause aspirated oropharyngeal flora , aspiration pneumonitis cause direct chemical insult due aspirate material . Aspiration pneumonitis pneumonia among hospitalized patient result increased morbidity , mortality utilization resource , increase cost care . Early identification patient risk aspiration crucial prevent preventable often iatrogenic condition . In general , common predispose factor aspiration adult alcoholism , stroke , neuromuscular disorder , seizure , loss consciousness , patient usually care ICU set . Furthermore , critically ill patient also risk frequently vary degree sedation , especially early post extubation period . Postoperative patient addition may prolong functional dysphagia due linger effect neuromuscular blocking agent . However , risk aspiration may apply hospitalized patient study broader inclusion criterion need base preliminary result pilot study . There multiple tool ass risk aspiration ICU . These include Dysphagia Admission Screening Tool ( DAST ) , Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation Swallow ( FEES ) Modified Barium Swallow ( MBS ) , routinely perform institution . The DAST relatively novel screen tool , bring early method identification dysphagia , mandate Joint Commission . This test yet validate . It create 2004 order reduce risk aspiration among new stroke patient , base upon literature review , research strong foundation knowledge experience Speech-Language Pathology evaluate dysphagia . The FEES MBS time consuming , often delay involve advanced testing perform certified speech-language pathologist and/or radiologist . MBS also require transport patient ICU radiology suite back . These test examine function swallow mechanism order predict individual patient 's risk aspiration . They report pas fail grade 1-8 , depend degree bolus penetration airway and/or expulsion airway . The current `` gold standard '' determine risk aspiration consider MBS . We hypothesize among critically ill , impairment phonation correlate significantly impairment deglutition . Since current practice patient 's risk aspiration judge base swallow ability , strong correlation impairment speech swallow mechanism may allow prognostication base phonation assessment alone . As phonetic evaluation simple , bedside test , may result early identification patient risk aspiration obviate need additional , invasive expensive test , additional staff utilization patient transport , test interpretation .</detailed_description>
