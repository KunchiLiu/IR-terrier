	<brief_title>Bisacodyl Use Post-operative Care Obstetrical/Gynecological ( OB/GYN ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus define disturbance bowel motility , clinically indistinguishable bowel obstruction , result noxious injurious bowel insult . During abdominal surgery , could due bowel manipulation exposure irritant like blood pu . This contribute post-operative morbidity result significant patient discomfort prolong hospital stay . The clinical picture variable presentation severity . Patients asymptomatic complain anorexia , cramp , abdominal pain , nausea vomiting , bloat . Severe case bilious vomit . No diagnostic test exclude diagnosis certainty presence absence bowel sound exam unreliable . Therefore , symptom primarily rely clinical management promote patient comfort . Postoperative ileus increase postoperative morbidity lengthen hospital stay . Traditionally , patient give nothing-by-mouth ( NPO ) major abdominal pelvic surgery allow rest dysfunctional bowel concern precipitate postoperative ileus . Patients start clear liquid diet advance accordingly documentation bowel function pass flatus , presence bowel sound , obvious evidence bowel obstruction nausea vomit . This base fact colonic motility last recover abdominal surgery ( usually 3-5 day ) less precise patient develop constipation . However , small bowel return normal peristaltic activity within 12-24 hour stomach within 24-48 hour . In addition , large body evidence indicate early feeding early ambulation stimulate gastrointestinal motility , reduce overall complication rate well improve patient comfort satisfaction . Laxatives also increase GI motility , permit passage flatus and/or stool , make surgeon comfortable permit early oral feed . This increase patient satisfaction , increase comfort decrease bloat allow faster recovery . Bisacodyl mild laxative greatly suit study post-operative period . However , laxative use cause cramping , abdominal pain , bloat . There several study find literature effect early bowel stimulation postoperative care . However , three study relate benefit use laxative postoperative care improve bowel function decrease incidence postoperative ileus . The Department OB/GYN Ohio show earlier return bowel function decrease hospital stay use Fleets Phosphorate Soda ( 66 % sodium phosphate ) patient radical hysterectomy . Another study do Hvidovre University ( Demark ) identify benefit use Magnesium Oxide Disodium Phosphate immediately postoperatively patient undergo hysterectomy . This study show difference postoperative nausea , vomit , pain , decrease length hospitalization one day ( N = 20 ) . In July 2007 , Department Surgery Mahidol University ( Thailand ) use Bisacodyl suppository third postoperative day patient underwent colectomy colon cancer . This study show increase incidence postoperative ileus . All study limit small number patient enrollment , none blind . Bisacodyl ( Dulcolax ) over-the-counter laxative . It coat protective coating digest stomach small intestine . Therefore , Dulcolax take effect large intestine , coat dissolve . Dulcolax metabolize liver CYP450 mechanism excrete stool urine . Dulcolax work large intestine stimulate nerve ending , cause muscle contract content bowel empty . Dulcolax use first treatment bowel stimulation due concern imbalance electrolytes well dependency . There study document adverse effect Dulcolax . There several study show Dulcolax one best choice bowel prep agent without significant discomfort imbalance electrolyte .</detailed_description>
