	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Metastatic Gallbladder Cancer Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival patient unresectable metastatic gallbladder carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma treat combination sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . II . To assess overall survival patient unresectable metastatic gallbladder carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma treat combination sorafenib erlotinib . III . To assess objective response rate . IV . To assess frequency severity toxicity . V. To collect specimen bank future research . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
