	<brief_summary>This research study investigate effect oxytocin vasopressin brain activity adult Autism Spectrum Disorders use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Background : - Oxytocin vasopressin two hormone produce brain . Both hormones influence activity brain region amygdala involve social emotional processing . There evidence suggest oxytocin vasopressin may implicate autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Objectives : -Here , use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ass effect oxytocin vasopressin brain activity adult healthy volunteer adult ASD . Eligibility : - Right-handed individual 18 40 year age either diagnose autism , Asperger disorder , Pervasive Developmental Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified ( PDD-NOS ) , healthy volunteer . Design : - This study require 3 outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center addition screen visit . Each visit last 2.5 hour . Participants may smoke cigarette drink alcohol caffeinated beverage 12 hour visit . - During visit , participant receive nasal spray contain one following : oxytocin , vasopressin , placebo . Participants receive different spray visit . - After use nasal spray , participant MRI scan brain performing task social emotional stimulus . - After MRI scan , participant complete questionnaire mood reaction task , remain clinic effect study medication worn . - Participants contact 1 day MRI scan follow-up purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal protocol , broadly state , evaluate effect neuropeptides oxytocin vasopressin neural system involve social cognition emotional processing healthy volunteer individual autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Study population : The research participant adult healthy volunteer adult ASD ( age 18-40 year ) . Design : This double-blind cross-over functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study , require three visit addition screen visit . At visit , participant receive intranasal application oxytocin , vasopressin , placebo scan perform social cognition task task involve process affective stimulus . Drug order randomize across participant group ( healthy control individual ASD ) . Outcome measure : The outcome measure include performance score reaction time ( RTs ) behavioral task change blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) activation brain , healthy volunteer patient ASD . Our main brain region interest amygdala .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Controls : Age 18 year 40 year . Blood Pressure ( BP ) less 140/90 Normal EKG . Menstrual phase : Female participant test follicular phase menstrual cycle ( defined day 612 first day last menstrual period ) . Patients : A diagnosis autism , Asperger disorder , PPD NOS . IQ &gt; 80 . Age 18 year 40 year . Blood Pressure ( BP ) less 140/90 Normal EKG . Menstrual phase : Female participant test follicular phase menstrual cycle ( defined day 612 first day last menstrual period ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Controls : Impaired hearing . Head trauma loss consciousness last year evidence functional impairment due persist head trauma . Having know risk exposure high magnetic field ( e.g . participant pace maker ) metallic implant ( e.g . brace ) head region ( likely create artifact MRI scan ) . Past present psychiatric , neurological , severe chronic medical illness . This include absence substance abuse history , learn disability DSM IV disorder . The investigator evaluate medical history . Potential subject medical condition judge interfere study may allow participate . Use medication drug would interfere study result . This include contraceptive hormone , steroid , medication psychiatric symptom like anxiety depression , stimulant , medication high blood pressure . Participants ask tell investigator medication drug take . The investigator consider drug interaction oxytocin vasopressin prior study , participant able participate study drug interaction could dangerous . Pregnancy Nursing Status : Because risk unborn fetus infant , woman pregnant nursing exclude protocol . Therefore , woman childbearing potential pregnancy test perform 24 hour drug administration able participate pregnancy test positive . Patients : Impaired hearing . Head trauma loss consciousness last year evidence functional impairment due persist head trauma . Having know risk exposure high magnetic field ( e.g . participant pace maker ) metallic implant ( e.g . brace ) head region ( likely create artifact MRI scan ) . A known neurological neurogenetic condition , uncontrolled epilepsy , cerebral palsy , chromosomal abnormality . Use medication drug would interfere study result ( see ) . Pregnancy Nursing Status : Because risk unborn fetus infant , woman pregnant nursing exclude protocol . Therefore , woman childbearing potential pregnancy test perform 24 hour drug administration able participate pregnancy test positive .</criteria>
