	<brief_summary>The loss muscle contraction ( paralysis ) remove important stimulus maintenance overall health individual complete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Increased protein catabolism ( atrophy ) limit important stress skeletal system . Bone loss double risk fracture contributes increase mortality Veterans SCI . Metabolic syndrome diabetes lead heart disease Veterans SCI high rate general population . Exercise method sustain muscle tissue , bone density , metabolic stability SCI lack scientific justification . If leave unchecked , secondary complication SCI health limit even life threaten Veterans paralysis . The importance maintain health musculoskeletal system SCI never great cure paralysis may become reality . Contemporary rehabilitation intervention lack ability functionally load muscle tissue , quantify dose load , stress cardiovascular system , monitor overall stress daily exercise training , offer portability improve compliance exercise . The long-term goal project establish optimal dose muscle bone stress functional exercise order improve health Veterans complete paralysis . The practical outcome research offer form activity feasible , portable , ground sound scientific principle . The scientific goal understand whether dose force generate paralyzed muscle via evoked contraction critical muscle atrophy/hypertrophy molecular pathway , physiologic performance , insulin sensitivity . The investigator administer various dos muscle force manipulating frequency electrical stimulation keep stimulation current ( i.e . muscle fiber recruitment ) constant . Interestingly , previous study examine dose muscle force necessary trigger adaptation protein synthesis/degradation pathway . The investigator wish discover effective method maintain molecular physiologic property paralyze muscle . The investigator believe method urgent demand co-intervention pharmaceutical strategy post-SCI rehabilitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize high muscle force induce via novel , portable , active stand intervention increase muscle force property , alter gene expression atrophy fiber type pathway , improve systemic insulin sensitivity Veterans complete paralysis . Aim 1 : To determine training effect 3 tier quadriceps muscle force muscle physiological property Veterans chronic paralysis SCI . Aim 2 : To determine training effect 3 tier quadriceps muscle force muscle mRNA gene associate atrophy muscle fiber type Veterans complete paralysis . Aim 3 : To determine training effect 2 tier compressive load induce quadriceps muscle force insulin sensitivity marker inflammation Veterans SCI .</detailed_description>
