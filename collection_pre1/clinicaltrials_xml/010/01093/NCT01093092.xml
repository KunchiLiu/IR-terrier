	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose calcitriol give cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient advance solid tumor remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Calcitriol may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Calcitriol may also help cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride kill tumor cell make sensitive drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcitriol , Cisplatin , Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose oral calcitriol combine standard dose gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) cisplatin 28-day cycle . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe toxicity combination use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . II . Study pharmacokinetics calcitriol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) expand cohort 6 patient . III . Describe clinical activity associate regimen advance solid tumor population . OUTLINE : Patients receive calcitriol orally ( PO ) day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 16 ; cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 2 ; gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 2 , 9 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
