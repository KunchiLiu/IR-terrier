	<detailed_description>Little known role adolescent neurodevelopment adolescent substance abuse treatment outcomes . The development evaluation adolescent substance abuse treatment rarely include consideration vary cognitive capacity neural representation determinant individual variation treatment response . This propose R21 project would address gap identifying association among decision making , task-related neural processing , treatment outcome among adolescent participating/have participate two randomized clinical trial adolescent substance abuse . Increasing understanding neural process underlie decision make adolescent marijuana alcohol user would inform development future intervention prevention effort . This complementary project draw subject two study investigate contingency-management ( CM ) base treatment `` Behavioral Treatment Adolescent Marijuana Abuse '' ( DA015186 ) , `` Family Based Contingency Management Adolescent Alcohol Abuse '' ( AA016917 ) . Both trial compare unique CM intervention involve abstinence-based reinforcement program standard , state art cognitive behavioral intervention . Analyses would perform separately two sample , hypothesis test first use Marijuana sample , assessed replication/specificity use Alcohol sample . The propose project would explore novel neurobiological predictor response CM intervention . Adolescents recruit Marijuana Trial ( n=69 ; 23 per treatment arm ) Alcohol Trial ( n=54 ; 27 per treatment arm ) period R21 project would participate single neuroimaging session soon intake session possible , within 7 30 day . During neuroimaging session , adolescent would make intertemporal choice decision Delay Discounting task regard gain $ 100 $ 1,000 . Preliminary data Marijuana trial demonstrate significant association performance behavioral delay discount task abstinence achieve treatment significant effect treatment condition . The investigator seek understand neural process underlie performance laboratory task , degree variation neural process relate predicts adolescent substance abuse treatment outcomes . The conceptual framework propose project base neuroeconomics addiction general , compete neural system hypothesis particular ( Bechara , 2005a ; Bickel , et al. , 2007 ; Daw , et al. , 2005 ; Jentsch &amp; Taylor , 1999 ) . This behavioral choice hypothesis postulate bias competition `` impulsive '' ( `` reflexive '' ) neural system ( include striatum , amygdala , ventral pallidum , related structure ) `` executive '' ( `` reflective '' ) neural system ( include prefrontal cortex ) understanding pattern suboptimal decision making among substance-dependent individual . An overarching hypothesis differ response distinct treatment approach ( CM vs. CBT ) partially determine pattern activation functional connectivity within across compete neural system . These project hypothesis would test follow specific aim : Primary Aims : - Determine degree performance laboratory delay discount task correlate activity impulsive and/or executive neural system . - Determine degree performance laboratory delay discount task neural processing predict adolescent substance abuse treatment outcome effect treatment condition . Secondary Aim : - Explore interaction response CM delay discounting-related neural processing . In summary , proposed exploratory/developmental project would importantly contribute understanding role neural process adolescent substance-abuse treatment process outcome . Specifically , study potential reveal relation among decision making , neural processing , treatment outcome , include role pattern neural activation response contingency management among adolescent substance abuser . Results implication future research adolescent neurodevelopment adolescent substance abuse treatment . The potential use neuroscience finding well understand improve treatment outcomes substance-abusing adolescent strong public health impact .</detailed_description>
