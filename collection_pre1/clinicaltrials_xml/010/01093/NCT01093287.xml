	<brief_summary>In recent multicenter randomize controlled trial , prolonged administration low-dose methylprednisolone ( 1mg/kg/day ) initiate early acute respiratory distress syndrome associate early resolution pulmonary extrapulmonary organ dysfunction reduction duration mechanical ventilation intensive care unit stay . However , glucocorticoid may induce serious adverse event adverse event might compensate positive effect prolong methylprednisolone infusion discourage physician treat acute respiratory distress syndrome patient glucocorticoid . Early prediction responsiveness prolong methylprednisolone infusion would help decide whether continue prolong methylprednisolone infusion could reduce drug relate adverse event . We project evaluate predictor responsiveness prolonged methylprednisolone infusion early acute respiratory distress syndrome .</brief_summary>
