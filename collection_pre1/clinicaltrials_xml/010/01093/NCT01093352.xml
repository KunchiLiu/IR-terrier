	<detailed_description>Purpose : Upper permanent canine frequently become impacted ( 2 % ) , prevent normal eruption ( Brin et al , 1986 . Ericson Kurol , 1986 ) . The upper canine may become impacted palatally ( 61 % ) buccally ( 4.5 % ) ( Stivaros Mandall , 2000 ) . One treatment option impact canine surgically expose canine tooth align use orthodontic appliance . A bracket attach tooth time surgery . The tooth align use orthodontic force . Alveolar-decortication also refer corticotomy-assisted orthodontics ( Fischer , 2007 ) . The technique involve exposure alveolar bone partial decortication cortical plate follow primary flap closure . It believe alternative surgical technique reduces time take orthodontically align teeth ; previous case report preliminary study report reduction 28 % 80 % treatment time ( Fischer , 2007 . Wilcko et al , 2001 ) . No rigorous clinical trial conduct evaluate efficacy alveolar-decortication reduce orthodontic treatment time . We plan evaluate technique patient palatally impact canine surgical procedure necessary anyway expose tooth additional surgical trauma minimal . Aims objectives : This study aim investigate effect alveolar-decortication addition surgical exposure , time take align palatally impacted canine . The alternative surgical technique compare conventional surgical exposure , record time take subsequently align tooth . The objective determine whether use alveolar-decortication whilst expose impacted tooth , lead reduction time require align tooth , therefore reduction overall treatment time . Recruitment consent : 30 orthodontic patient ( n=15 per group ) , await exposure bond palatally impact canine tooth , select wait list Birmingham Dental Hospital . Potential participant invite take part study ; give verbal write information . If happy take part , write consent obtain . All patient recruit competent capable make decision . For patient 16 year age , parental/legal guardian consent obtain . The patient able withdraw study time , wish continue participate . Methods : Participants randomly allocate either control test group , time surgery . Randomisation use method randomly permute block variable block size . Enrolled participant assign study number time surgery . The envelope group assignment open completion surgical exposure ( prior wound closure ) . For subject randomised test group , alveolar-decortication carry prior wound closure . While surgeon blind obvious reason , group assignment disclose patient disclosed orthodontist . At time surgery , 3 intra-oral photograph take upper arch , include expose tooth . Following surgery , orthodontic treatment carry normal way . At routine appointment , 3 intra-oral photograph take upper arch , include canine tooth . These photograph insert computer programme , stereo-imaging technique use construct 3-D image , allow velocity tooth movement calculate . Impressions take upper arch treatment , resultant study model also use calculate velocity tooth movement . The distance tip canine tooth , line arch measure calliper , time surgery also routine orthodontic appointment . Inclusion criterion : Patients Birmingham Dental Hospital . Patients palatally impacted canine , await surgical exposure . Patients bilateral impacted canine may include , case canine treat use surgical technique determine allocation either test control group . Informed consent gain . Exclusion criterion : History periodontal disease . Radiographical evidence pathology associate impacted canine . Patients already participate research study .</detailed_description>
