	<detailed_description>This intergroup multicenter , randomize , open label study design compare efficacy safety Rd MPR CPR newly diagnose symptomatic MM patient 65 year age old . Potential study subject sign inform consent prior undergo study related procedure . This study consist 3 phase study subject : Pre-treatment , Treatment Follow up.Pre-treatment period : patient undergo screen protocol eligibility within 28 day ( 4weeks ) prior randomization . Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize base computer-generated randomization schedule prepare Coordinating Centre . The first randomization occur induction treatment : Arm A ( Rd ) B ( MPR ) C ( CPR ) . Within arm patient randomized maintenance treatment ( lenalidomide lenalidomide prednisone ) : Arms A1 ( R ) A2 ( RP ) ; Arms B1 ( R ) B2 ( RP ) ; Arms C1 ( R ) C2 ( RP ) . Randomization conceal end induction period maintenance treatment . Patients stratify randomization accord International Staging System ( 5 ) age ( &lt; 75 year vs &gt; 75 year ) .Treatment period include induction maintenance . During induction maintenance phase , patient attend periodic study center visit order ass safety efficacy treatment . This protocol also provide substudy design observe asymptomatic patient exclude protocol case could insert study . The asymptomatic patient characterize absence end-organ damage tissue involvement , anemia , bone lesion , hypercalcemia , renal failure , relevant clinical condition , hyperviscosity , amyloidosis , recurrent infection ( CRAB ) .</detailed_description>
