	<brief_summary>The research question answer study : 1 . Is treatment iron effective improve anemia give time malaria episode 1 month episode ? 2 . Which treatment timing associate malaria episodes - 1 month delay treatment immediate treatment time malaria ? 3 . Does time iron treatment affect later think process behavior ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population study child enrol ongoing study cerebral malaria severe malarial anemia , `` Pathogenesis cognitive/neurologic deficit central nervous system malaria '' , underway Kampala , Uganda . The pathogenesis study seek address question child severe malaria later problem think . The study propose build study assess whether child severe malaria iron deficiency , , whether treatment iron time malaria less effective treatment one month later . We believe treatment one month later may effective data show inflammation occur malaria episode may decrease body 's ability absorb iron gut send iron place need , like bone marrow brain . We study see hypothesis effective iron treatment delay correct assess anemia prevalence , iron status , long-term neurobehavioral development outcome . We three study group : child cerebral malaria , child severe malarial anemia , healthy community control child . Children find iron deficient randomize receive iron ( ferrous sulphate syrup ) either immediately one-month follow-up visit . At 1- , 6 , 12-month follow-up visit change iron inflammation indicator assess . At 6- 12-month visit , neurocognitive behavior also evaluate compare immediate vs. delay iron group . Malaria morbidity assess via home visit period iron supplementation via clinic monitoring duration study .</detailed_description>
