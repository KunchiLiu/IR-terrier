	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together cyclophosphamide see well work treat patient previously treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer . Lenalidomide may stop growth prostate cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lenalidomide together cyclophosphamide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Previously Treated Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) lenalidomide administer combination oral cyclophosphamide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response ( 50 % decrease PSA level sustain least 4 week ) define PSA work group criterion ; decrease absolute PSA decrease PSA velocity , increase PSA double time , duration response . II . To explore anti-tumor activity combination lenalidomide plus oral cyclophosphamide patient previously treat hormone refractory prostate cancer . III . To evaluate baseline change quality life , particularly , bone pain analgesic consumption , patient combination chemotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether related cytokine biomarkers ( serum level tumor necrosis factor-alpha , basic fibroblast growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] , T cell inhibitory activity , phytohemagglutinin [ PHA ] interleukin [ IL ] -2 , mononuclear cell isolation , VEGF , basic fibroblast growth factor [ bFGF ] , IL-6 ) help predict response patient undergoing treatment lenalidomide cyclophosphamide . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 cyclophosphamide PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment modification may apply accord response . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
