	<brief_title>Study Ambrisentan With Antifibrotic Agent Combination Therapy Diffuse Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single center study determine efficacy safety ambrisentan antifibrotic agent combination systemic sclerosis . Up twenty patient recruit within next year early diffuse systemic sclerosis presently receive treatment follow antifibrotic agent - cellcept , colchicine , azathioprine , D-penicillamine , methotrexate cyclophosphamide . Ambrisentan add present agent follow 12 month . Patients , male female , &gt; 18 year clinical diagnosis systemic sclerosis fulfil criterion American College Rheumatology ( formerly American Rheumatism Association ) classification criterion systemic sclerosis ( 24 ) , diffuse cutaneous involvement base criterion LeRoy et al A thorough baseline evaluation determine extent severity systemic sclerosis individual patient use laboratory study clinical evaluation . Monthly follow-ups capture safety issue relate combination therapy base laboratory study clinical evaluation . At six month twelve month follow-up thorough evaluation undertaken evaluate extent severity disorder . Event driven follow-up also take place record establish safety issue may arise . Clinical end-points focus study . Dosing ambrisentan begin 5mg daily first month . Half patient remain 5mg daily , remain patient increase maintenance dose 10mg daily fourth week . Subjects continue present dose schedule disease modifying/antifibrotic medication duration study .</detailed_description>
