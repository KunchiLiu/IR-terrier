	<brief_summary>The objective study obtain good understand spectrum use mechanical ventilation intensive care unit : 1 . Main analysis : To know all-cause mortality rate mechanically ventilate patient 2 . Secondary analysis : - To know current status mechanical ventilation intensive care unit determine number percentage patient admit intensive care unit require mechanical ventilation . - To compare result prior data collect previous observational study ( 1998 2004 ) - Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation - Weaning - Use adjuvant therapy steroid selective digestive decontamination - Sedation include prevalence delirium mechanically ventilate patient - Prediction duration mechanical ventilation - Other</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Third International Study Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation commonly use patient admit intensive care unit . Clinical study investigate aspect associate utilization , contribute improve knowledge management patient acute respiratory failure . In 1998 invesgtigators conduct first international study mechanical ventilation , include 5183 patient mechanically ventilate long 12 hour ( Esteban A. JAMA 2002 ) . Six year later , investigator carry second international study mechanical ventilation include 4968 patient . These study allow u analyze evolution mechanical ventilation judge concordance practice result randomize trial ( Esteban A . Am J Respir Crit Care 2008 ) . The main finding study high degree concordance observe change mechanical ventilation practice change predict report randomize controlled trial . However , despite apparently beneficial change ventilatory practice , investigator able detect significant difference clinical outcome time period . Our result serve updated benchmark usual care outcomes mechanically ventilated patient 'real-world ' setting . The investigator propose conduct third international study mechanical ventilation , 6 year 2nd study 12 year original . This prospective , multicenter single-cohort study , enroll consecutive patient receive mechanical ventilation least 12 hour 1-month period , follow patient duration mechanical ventilation , 28 day . With 3rd study investigator aim : 1 ) determine observe change investigator report previously maintain time ; 2 ) evaluate change implement impacted outcome ; 3 ) analyze aspect relate withdrawal mechanical ventilation ; implementation non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ; 4 ) evaluate difference may occur geographical area .</detailed_description>
