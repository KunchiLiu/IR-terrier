	<brief_title>Insights Pathophysiology Transient Left Ventricular Ballooning Syndrome ( TLVBS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show recently patient previous TLVBS cold pressor test ( CPT ) able induce new mid-ventricular apical wall motion abnormality , similar acute phase syndrome . Moreover , coronary blood flow ( CBF ) , assess mean myocardial contrast echocardiography ( MCE ) , increase group control subject TLVBS patient , suggest chronic impairment coronary vasodilation reserve thus microvascular dysfunction . Since syndrome clearly rare phenomenon since prognosis benign originally think , need research etiology pathophysiology TLVBS . Therefore investigator aim study microvascular endothelial function population TLVBS patient . The project split two part : 1 . From patient already know prospective registry , patient willing participate inform consent ask undergo `` reactive hyperaemia - pulse amplitude tonometry '' ( RH-PAT ) baseline CPT cardiac magnetic resonance scan ( CMR ) , least 3 month last TLVBS event . The RH-PAT evaluate endothelial function . The CMR-evaluation rest consist assessment global regional leave ventricular function , exclusion irreversible damage ( lack gadolinium hyperenhancement ) evaluation rest perfusion . Subsequently , adenosine-induced hyperemia induce infusion 140 µg/kg/min adenosine 3 4 minute , stress perfusion sequence start 3 minute . After approximately 10 minute , CPT perform ( 180 second immersion leave foot ice water ( 4°C ) ) immediately follow series CMR cine sequence second stress perfusion CMR sequence . Afterwards RH-PAT examination repeat blood sample do measure plasma level B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , catecholamine epinephrine , norepinephrine , dopamine marker endothelial function endothelin-1 . Patients monitor one hour discharge two-dimensional ( 2D ) echocardiography perform exclude residual wall motion abnormality . The investigator goal include least 30 patient protocol . 2 . Patients newly admit TLVBS follow clinical path index hospitalisation include serial ECG recording , serial blood sample cardiac biomarkers ( Troponin I , CKMB ) , sole sample BNP , catecholamines endothelin-1 , RH-PAT measurement , 2D echocardiogram , coronary angiogram CMR rest perfusion sequence . They also ask return hospital 3 month evaluation mention . Patients add prospective registry .</detailed_description>
