	<brief_title>Rotation Technique Insertion ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous series study , introduce new , simple effective 90 degree rotational insertion technique insertion success rate great le pain occurred rotational technique adult . In study , investigate whether 90 degree rotational technique improve insertion success rate standard technique pediatric patient . We hypothesize 90 degree rotational technique improve insertion success rate decrease complication 2 3 size PLMA standard index finger insertion technique child . One hundred twenty six Asian pediatric patient randomly allocate standard technique group rotation technique group . The size PLMA 2 3 accord body weight child . In standard technique group ( n = 63 ) , PLMA insert index finger insertion technique . In rotation technique group ( n = 63 ) , entire cuff PLMA place mouth without finger insertion midline approach rotate 90 degree counterclockwise around tongue . The PLMA advance rotate back resistance felt . The primary outcome success first insertion . Secondary outcome measure insertion time complication . Success first insertion significantly high rotation technique standard technique , significantly less time require . With rotation technique , incidence PLMA reposition blood stain significantly less standard technique . The rotational insertion technique PLMA successful standard insertion technique associate few blood stain PLMA suggest cause less pharyngeal trauma pediatric patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Asian pediatric patient ( age range 39 year ; American Society Anesthesiologists physical status III ) require general anesthesia PLMA elective surgery . Pediatric patient weigh less 10 kg 50 kg , congenital heart disease , respiratory disease risk aspiration .</criteria>
