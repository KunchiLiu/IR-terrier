	<detailed_description>Finding safe effective method improve blood glucose ( BG ) control without weight gain one major goal diabetes research . Previous research study show Levemir Byetta safe effective medication treatment type 2 diabetes . Both drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment type 2 diabetes . The use Levemir Byetta combination study , investigational , mean approve FDA use . However , FDA allow use Levemir Byetta combination study safety effectiveness improve blood sugar level little weight gain people type 2 diabetes . Levemir long act insulin usually take day bedtime last 24 hour . Unlike insulin low blood glucose level , cause weight gain , clinical research trial suggest Levemir may lower blood glucose level without cause weight gain may even result weight loss . Byetta insulin , improve blood glucose control mimic action hormone gastrointestinal tract call incretins . The incretin hormone trigger release insulin pancreas allow insulin work effectively body . Byetta also delay movement food stomach small intestine . As result , people take Byetta may feel `` full '' faster longer , eat less . The common side effect Byetta mild moderate nausea , improve time people . Clinical research trial study effect Byetta show , addition lower blood glucose level , use Byetta result weight loss .
