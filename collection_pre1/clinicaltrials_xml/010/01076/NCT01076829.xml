	<brief_summary>Polyphenols belong large group secondary metabolite produce plant , mainly , response biotic abiotic stress infection , wound , UV irradiation , exposure ozone , pollutant , hostile environmental condition . It think molecular basis protective action polyphenols plant antioxidant free radical scavenging property . These numerous phenolic compound major biologically active component spice , aroma , essential oil , traditional medicine . In order investigate impact spice polyphenols postprandial flow-mediated dilation , nitric oxide , glucose , insulin , triglycerieds , oxidize LDL , cytoxic lipid peroxidation product ( MDA ) level men type 2 diabetes , investigator propose achieve follow specific aim use randomize crossover study design : 1 . To determine effect ground beef patty meal without polyphenol-rich spice postprandial level plasma oxidize LDL , triglyceride , insulin , glucose , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) . 2 . To determine effect ground beef patty meal without polyphenol-rich spice postprandial level nitric oxide flow-mediated dilation . 3 . To determine effect ground beef patty meal without spice blend MDA accumulation urine . This study determine whether spice polyphenols exert beneficial effect inhibition absorption lipotoxin MDA males type 2 diabetes mellitus.Men diabetes mellitus type 2 select study enable assessment marker vascular health include nitric oxide plasma flow-mediated dilation . These finding may help explain potentially harmful effect oxidizable fat find food important benefit dietary polyphenols ameliorate potentially harmful effect .</brief_summary>
