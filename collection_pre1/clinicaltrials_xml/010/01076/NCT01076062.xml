	<brief_summary>Primary outcome : evaluate effect elective induction labor ( IOL ) , 39 week gestation , cesarean delivery rate nulliparous woman compare expectant management ( EM ) . Secondary outcome : evaluate difference mean number clinic visits/antepartum test avoid IOL , compare difference utilization inpatient resource ( mean duration inpatient stay , mean duration labor ) , evaluate effect IOL risk urinary/anal incontinence sexual dysfunction analyze use previously validate measurement . We evaluate difference rate cervical change active labor diagnose , time completion active labor , define complete dilation complete effacement , delivery fetus ( definition second stage active labor ) . Furthermore , secondary outcome evaluate include comparison IOL EM regard occurence chorioamnionitis , stillbirth , operative vaginal delivery , meconium stain amniotic fluid . An evaluation predictive value cervical length Bishop score vaginal delivery also examine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A research nurse screen patient 38 week visit chart review potential candidate identify . One study investigator research nurse interface patient 38 week visit write informed consent obtain study protocol explain eligibility determine . Since eligibility determination make without perform digital cervical examination , patient offer cervix exam Bishop score determination . If Bishop score meet inclusion criterion , patient offer participation study . Women consent study randomize use computer-generated list mean sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope reveal allocation subject either induction expectant management . All subject receive follow evaluation : transvaginal cervical length measurement , completion standard urinary/rectal incontinence/sexual function questionnaire . Patients randomized induction schedule earlier 39 week gestation coordination labor delivery physician nursing leadership . The method induction dependant whether cervical foley bulb place time admission induction labor . If cervical foley bulb placement possible , foley bulb remain place either spontaneously remove 12 hour , whichever earlier . If placement possible , cervical ripen misoprostol 25 mcg per vagina every 4 hour ( maximum 4 total dos ) initiate . Cervical examination occur every 4 hour ( coincident vaginal misoprostol placement ) . Repeat dose misoprostol give foley bulb placement possible and/or palpably firm uterine contraction le 6 10 minute consecutive 10 minute interval . Once placement cervical foley bulb perform accomplished initiation oxytocin administration begin 2 mIU/minute increase 2 mIU/minute every 20 minute ensure adequate contraction ( maximum oxytocin infusion rate 36 mIU/minute ) . Adequate contraction define 7 contraction 15 minute consecutive 15 minute interval palpate moderate firm . Oxytocin infusion begin earlier 4 hour last misoprostol dose ( give ) . Subjects expectantly manage ( EM ) schedule routine follow-up appointment deliver obstetric indication later 42 week gestation . A routine 6-8 week immediate postpartum 1 year follow-up examination schedule subject follow delivery . In addition routine examination , subject evaluation visit include completion standard urinary/rectal incontinence/sexual function . Study data enter password protect Excel file DoD government computer accessible study investigator clinical research nurse . Withdrawal study voluntary result analyze intent-to-treat basis . Data analysis focus primary outcome : evaluate effect elective induction labor , 39 week gestation , cesarean delivery rate nulliparous woman compare expectant ( typical ) management . Also evaluation secondary outcome include determination predictive value cervical length Bishop score successful vaginal delivery ; risk urinary/anal incontinence sexual dysfunction labor induction compare spontaneous labor ; number clinic visits/antepartum test avoid elective induction compare potential increase utilization inpatient resource ; evaluation labor curve induction compare spontaneous labor . Other secondary outcome evaluate include comparison IOL EM regard rate chorioamnionitis , rate stillbirth , rate operative vaginal delivery , rate meconium stain amniotic fluid . Students t-test used compare continuous variable Chi-square test use compare proportion group . Analysis intent-to-treat p-value le 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
