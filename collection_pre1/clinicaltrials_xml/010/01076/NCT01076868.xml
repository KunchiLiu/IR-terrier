	<brief_title>Incidence Vivax Along Thai Burma Border</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate likely approach malaria elimination ; administration radical curative dose primaquine entire potentially infected population . In study focus patient vivax malaria past year likely harbour liver hypnozoites . Radical treatment give Thai-Burmese border risk consider outweigh benefit , recommend Thailand . We believe policy could change sufficient information . Patients receive chloroquine treatment could consider incompletely treat . We plan conduct carefully document evaluation radical treatment patient . Through aim determine incidence vivax malaria patient live vivax endemic area follow radical treatment . This provide information safety tolerability primaquine , use context likely elimination programme , also provide information incidence vivax malaria . Adults child &gt; 6 month old document P.vivax infection last 12 month recruit . In conjunction parallel study evaluate epidemiology treat vivax malaria , able characterize relapse history P vivax . This provide foundation study evaluate efficacy primaquine regimen .</detailed_description>
