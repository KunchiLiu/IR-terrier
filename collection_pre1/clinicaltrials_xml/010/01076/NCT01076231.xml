	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy , proton beam radiation therapy , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue patient non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving proton beam radiation therapy together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose proton beam radiation therapy give together cisplatin etoposide see well work treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Beam Radiation Therapy Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility . ( Phase I ) II . To determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose . ( Phase I ) III . To determine pathologic CR rate . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess late complication irradiation use proton beam therapy place conventional photon beam therapy . ( Phase II ) II . To assess acute side effect irradiation use proton beam therapy place conventional photon beam therapy . ( Phase II ) III . To compare dose distribution tumor surround normal structure use DVH 's ( Dose Volume Histograms ) generate proton plan use treat patient photon plan generate comparison purpose . ( Phase II ) IV . To determine progression-free survival ( Phase II ) late toxicity . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study proton beam radiation therapy follow phase II study . Patients undergo proton beam radiotherapy 5.5-7.5 week . Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy comprise cisplatin IV day 1 , 8 , 29 , 36 etoposide IV day 1-5 day 29-33.Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 4-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient may undergo surgical resection additional chemoradiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
