	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together temozolomide treat young patient relapse refractory primary brain tumor spinal cord tumor . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may help temozolomide work well make tumor cell sensitive drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend phase II dose vorinostat combination temozolomide pediatric patient relapse refractory primary CNS tumor . II . To define describe toxicity regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity regimen within confines phase I study . II . To characterize pharmacokinetic parameter vorinostat patient . III . To determine whether acetylated histone peripheral blood mononuclear cell identify surrogate marker biologic effect vorinostat various treatment dos . IV . To assess feasibility collect analyze serum DNA methylation MGMT promoter describe relationship promoter methylation clinical response within confines phase I study . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients receive oral vorinostat oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic correlative laboratory study western blot MGMT promoter methylation assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
