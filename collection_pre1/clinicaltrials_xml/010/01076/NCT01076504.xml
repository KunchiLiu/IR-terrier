	<brief_summary>This propose trial investigate combination amrubicin carboplatin first-line treatment patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer ( ES- SCLC ) . Since myelosuppression common toxicity produce drug combination , pegfilgrastim administer treatment cycle . This trial first clinical trial evaluate combination amrubicin carboplatin first-line treatment ES SCLC U.S. population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Cytologically and/or histologically confirm smallcell lung cancer extensive stage disease . 2 . Measurable evaluable disease per RECIST criterion version 1.1 . 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) 01 . 4 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥50 % echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) . 5 . QTc interval ≤450 msec . ECG . 6 . Adequate organ function , include follow : ANC ≥1500 cells/micro liter Platelet count ≥100,000 cells/micro liter Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ; AST/ALT ≤2.5 x ULN , ( except due hepatic metastasis , ≤5 x ULN ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN 7 . Patients must able receive growth factor ( GCSF ) . 8 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test perform ≤ 7 day prior start treatment . Women childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must use effective birth control measure treatment . If woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study , must agree inform treat physician immediately . 9 . Patients ≥18 year age . 10 . Patients must accessible treatment followup . 11 . Patients must able understand investigational nature study give write informed consent prior study entry . 1 . Previous treatment limitedstage SCLC . 2 . Previous chemotherapy radiation therapy SCLC ( unless radiation administer brain metastasis ) . 3 . Active brain metastasis . Patients treat brain metastasis eligible , ( 1 ) radiation therapy complete ≥ 21 day prior first dose amrubicin ; ( 2 ) followup scan show disease progression ; absence neurologic symptom ( 3 ) patient require steroid . 4 . Mixed small cell/nonsmall cell tumor neuroendocrine lung cancer . 5 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . 6 . Suspected , diffuse idiopathic interstitial lung disease pulmonary fibrosis . 7 . Patients New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class II great congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . 8 . Any following ≤6 month prior start study treatment : myocardial infarction ; severe unstable angina ; ongoing cardiac dysrhythmia . 9 . Family history idiopathic cardiomyopathy uncontrolled heart arrhythmia . 10 . Treatment invasive cancer previous 5 year , presence active invasive cancer type ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer ) . 11 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( i.e. , blood pressure &gt; 150/90 mmHg control standard antihypertensive agent ) . 12 . Major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury ≤ 28 day study initiation . 13 . History seropositive HIV patient receive immunosuppressive medication would opinion investigator increase risk serious neutropenic complication . 14 . Concurrent severe , intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 15 . Any condition would prevent patient comprehension nature , risk associate , study . 16 . Use nonapproved investigational agent ≤30 day prior administration first dose study drug . Patients may receive investigational anticancer treatment participate study .</criteria>
