	<brief_summary>This randomize trial participant recruit one dialysis unit Brazilian university hospital . Hemodialysis patient assign receive resistance exercise combine aerobic training resistance train alone period 10 week . The functional performance patient assess intervention six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) . The difference time 6MWT compare group multivariate linear regression . Thirteen patient allocate group intervention . The difference distance walk intervention combine train group +39.7 ( 61.4 ) meter , difference resistance train group -19.2 ( 53.9 ) meter , p=0.01 . In multivariate analysis adjustment age , skin color , gender , hematocrit , time since start dialysis , Kt/V baseline value 6MWT , type training remain significantly associate amount increase walk distance . Although best protocol exercise patient dialysis yet clear , investigator sample hemodialysis patient combination aerobic resistance training effective improve functional performance .</brief_summary>
