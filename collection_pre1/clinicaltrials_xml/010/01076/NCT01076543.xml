	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together temsirolimus see well work treat patient Hodgkin lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma come back period improvement respond treatment . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Lenalidomide may also stop growth Hodgkin lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma block blood flow cancer . Temsirolimus may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving lenalidomide together temsirolimus may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , toxicity , maximum tolerate dose lenalidomide combine temsirolimus patient relapse lymphoma . ( Phase I ) II . To determine complete overall response rate lenalidomide plus temsirolimus patient relapse lymphomas stratified histology : follicular lymphoma , diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , lymphoma otherwise specify ( NOS ) ( include Hodgkin lymphoma , T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ T-NHL ] , lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma ) . ( Phase II ) III . To determine duration response , progression-free survival , overall survival lenalidomide plus temsirolimus patient relapse lymphomas stratified histology : diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , follicular lymphoma , lymphoma NOS ( include Hodgkin lymphoma , T-NHL , lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway activation pre-treatment tumor tissue . II . To determine angiogenic microenvironmental status pre-treatment tissue peripheral blood sample , evaluate change follow treatment temsirolimus lenalidomide . III . To determine differentially express gene associate difference clinical response progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) follicular lymphoma ( FL ) ( Groups A B , respectively ) . IV . To determine methylation signature predictive clinical response PFS patient DLBCL FL ( Groups A B , respectively ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease 2 course may continue therapy 52 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
