	<brief_title>Prospective Analysis Cerebral Perfusion Using Head Ultrasound Multi-source-detector Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : There 4 objective study . 1 . To determine use cranial ultrasound multi-source-detector near infrared spectroscopy identify alteration cerebral perfusion associate long-term neurologic dysfunction . 2 . Evaluate whether change resistive index determine cranial ultrasound cardiopulmonary bypass associate major neurologic dysfunction . 3 . Describe regional change brain tissue oxygenation selective cerebral perfusion use near-infrared spectroscopy determine critical threshold correlate poor neurologic outcome . To accomplish , describe difference cerebral blood flow oxygenation related structural anatomy heart . Specifically , compare single ventricle two ventricle heart regard use cardiopulmonary bypass without selective cerebral perfusion . We also determine prolong reduction cerebral oxygenation intraoperatively associate ultrasound-diagnosed periventricular leukomalacia discharge . 4 . Prospectively collect patient ' DNA determine difference exist neurologic outcome associate genetic variation . Specifically , look simple karyotyping , single nucleotide polymorphism , copy number variation difference patient . This DNA collect stored future comparison child congenital heart disease undergo neurodevelopmental testing . Background : The incidence congenital heart disease least 10 per 1000 live bear child child congenital heart disease high risk develop neurologic abnormalities1 . Patients single ventricle mean full scale IQ 89-97 incidence severe mental retardation hypoplastic leave heart syndrome high 18 % 2 , 3 . The factor influence risk multiple include preoperative , intraoperative , postoperative event . One major risk factor use deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA ) , historically employ obtain bloodless operate field aortic arch reconstruction . Since become increasingly evident safe duration DHCA , newly develop strategy aim maximize cerebral blood flow thereby improve neurologic outcomes4-7 . One strategy widely employ selective cerebral perfusion ( SCP ) , increase cerebral blood flow via dedicated brain cannula advance right common carotid artery aortic arch reconstruction.8 This technique , decrease period cerebral ischemia , show animal model improve neurologic outcome , similar study perform humans9 . It known cerebral vascular resistance increase DHCA suggest SCP may contribute post-bypass cerebral vascular hypertension10 , 11 . Single channel near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) measurement show correlate cerebral blood flow animal model , evaluation SCP multi-site-detector NIRS perform , unknown regional oxygenation differences12 , 13 . This study would provide important information cerebral blood flow characteristic regional tissue , particularly relate unilateral perfusion well differences patient complex anatomy compromise cerebral blood flow . Cranial ultrasound Doppler resistance measurement use predict hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy term preterm infants14-16 . It known infant severe congenital heart disease abnormal cerebral blood flow , particularly single ventricle , put increase risk periventricular leukomalacia17-19 . It clear , however , measurement associate adverse neurodevelopmental outcome , whether use combination NIRS provide bedside information neurologic health adequacy current hemodynamic management . While NIRS demonstrate associated new worsen ischemia postoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , often case infant stable enough risk inherent obtain MRI , include transport sedation , ultrasound may serve appropriate , safe , screen tool20 , 21 . We propose use experimental continuous diagnostic modality ( NIRS ) , combine know screen tool ( cranial ultrasound ) , analyze evaluate cerebral blood flow oxygenation , determine abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome predict potentially improve upon . The optimal timing ultrasound performance know , thus important obtain pilot data refine diagnostic combination best ass risk neurologic injury . Another well know risk factor poor neurologic outcome child congenital heart disease genetics22 . Single gene polymorphism identify associated poor neurodevelopmental outcome identified23 . Further study need do well understand genetic key congenital heart disease neurologic outcomes result . This single center , prospective analysis cerebral perfusion infant 2 month age undergoing repair congenital heart disease . A total 70 subject consent protocol hop 60 complete study . Subjects expect participate study total 6 year , enrollment final neurocognitive assessment . Subjects receive $ 25 12 month follow-up evaluation , $ 50 three year evaluation , $ 75 6 year evaluation patient incentive . Infants ( 2 month ) congenital heart disease undergo surgery Children 's Medical Center Dallas ( CMCD ) eligible . All patient receive standard pre- , intra- , post-operative care . Enrolled patient undergo pre-operative head ultrasound determine resistive index Doppler flow middle cerebral artery . Patients multi-source-detector NIRS device place scalp held place Velcro . The probe attach wire connect data collection computer . This device collect data intra-operatively regional tissue oxygenation blood flow compare many different area brain . A second head ultrasound obtain immediate post-operative period determine resistive index Doppler flow ( within 4 hour ) . Finally , third head ultrasound perform within 48 hour discharge screen periventricular leukomalacia , injury brain 's white matter . These examination painful produce additional burden patient . These diagnostic test part research process standard care . Single channel NIRS monitoring standard care perform usually . Neurodevelopmental status assess trained pediatric neuropsychologist 12 month age . The Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development perform 12 month evaluation ( 2 hour ) . The Wechsler Preschool Primary Scales Intelligence perform 3 year evaluation ( 2 hour ) . The Children 's Memory Scales , Beery Visual-Motor Integration Tests , Child Behavior Checklists , Woodcock Johnson Tests Language Proficiency perform 6 year evaluation ( 3 hour ) . These test consider standard care patient , provide important information learn disability school performance . Additionally , subject option consent provide DNA sample . If subject consent , one sample blood collect doctor , nurse , license technician . We take 30ml blood collect day surgery already exist line . These sample draw accordance CMCD 's maximum blood sampling volume policy . The sample completely de-identified assign unique two digit identifier prior sent Kernie lab UTSW extraction analysis . This sample store database compare future study subject congenital heart disease . This blood draw occur already exist line ( necessary surgery ) add additional burden patient . Genetic testing may include analysis single nucleotide polymorphism , copy number variation , simple karyotyping . Correlation type congenital heart disease , result neurodevelopmental exam , image result make DNA result .</detailed_description>
