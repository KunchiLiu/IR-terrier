	<criteria>Subjects caregiver must provide write Informed Consent willing comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , trial procedure . AD : Diagnostic evidence probable AD consistent Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSMIV ) National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDSADRDA ) criteria meet site Physician time Screening visit . This evidence must fully document participant 's file prior Baseline Visit . For amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) : A Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) 0.5 ( memory box score least 0.5 ) memory complaint objectively verify use test episodic memory : Delayed recall one paragraph Wechsler Logical Memory scale ( cutoff score education maximum score 25 ) . Less equal 8 16 year education ; Less equal 4 815 year education ; Less equal 2 07 year education . Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) score 2130 Male female subject non childbearing potential ( use appropriate birth control measure ) least 50 year age . In generally good health , opinion Principal Investigator ( PI ) , base medical history , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , physical examination , vital sign , 12lead ECG , laboratory value , include hematology chemistry value . No known genetic AD cause early onset memory impairment ( e.g. , presenilin mutation ) , participant family know autosomal dominant AD associate mutation APP , PS1 , PS2 gene strongly suspect , yet identify mutation APP , PS1 PS2 gene Down 's syndrome eligible enroll . Individuals family late onset AD 2 affect family member may participate . Type II diabetic subject may include provided disease serum glucose value control actively manage , assess PI use fast blood sugar and/or HgbA1C ( per PI 's medical judgment consultation Sponsor ) . RosenModified Hachinski Ischemia Score less equal 4 . Diagnosis history possible cause significant contributor dementia , include limited neurodegenerative disorder ( eg , frontotemporal dementia , Lewy body disease , vascular dementia ) , vitamin B12 deficiency ( reflex Methylmalonic Acid ( MMA ) folate B12 low ) , untreated thyroid disease , syphilis , alcoholism , severe recurrent head injury clinically relevant disease study , onset dementia follow heart surgery cardiac arrest . Diagnosis history cerebrovascular disease ( eg , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , severe carotid stenosis , cerebral hemorrhage , intracranial tumor , subarachnoid hemorrhage , subdural hematoma could contribute subject 's current cognitive functional status , impair ability fully participate trial may impact status one week study . Specific exclusionary brain MRI finding identify prior study baseline determine investigator could either contribute subject 's current cognitive functional decline impair ability fully participate trial may impact status trial : History cancer within last year ( except cutaneous basal cell , squamous cell cancer resolve excision , colon polyp resolve excision , nonprogressive prostate cancer per investigator 's judgment ) . History clinically significant cardiovascular renal event . Subjects uncontrolled hypertension even therapeutic intervention History clinically significant ( determined PI consultation Sponsor ) syncope , seizure , head trauma , clinically significant unexplained loss consciousness within last 5 year . A diagnosis major depressive disorder psychiatric illness primary diagnosis per DSMIV text revision ( TR ) criterion per investigator 's judgment . History schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , severe mental illness . Known history alcohol drug abuse ( define DSMIVTR ) within 5 year prior dose positive result regard use illicit drug drug screen test . History clinically significant symptom pulmonary disease require treatment ( eg . asthma , COPD , chronic respiratory condition ) . Known positive Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) status . Unwilling unable comply Life Style guideline describe protocol . Exclusions Related Medications Procedures Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) Study Day 1 . Use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within three month study Day 1 . Use medication ( ) cognitive enhancement ≤ 90 day first dose study medication . Prescription : include limited donepezil , galantamine , rivastigmine , tacrine , memantine , Axona™ ; Reason stoppage donepezil may relate tolerability issue gain entry study . Nonprescription treatment cognitive enhancement . Subjects either nonremovable ferromagnetic implant ( cardiac pacemaker ) , aneurysm clip foreign body would contraindicate brain MRI scan . A clinically significant ( determined PI ) abnormality 12lead ECG , include complete heart block , bradycardia ( heart rate &lt; 40 beats/minute ) , sinus pause &gt; 2 second , second third degree heart block , QTc &gt; 450 abnormality judge clinically significant PI .</criteria>
