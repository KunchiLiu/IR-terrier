	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy surgery kill remain tumor cell may effective treatment breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well radiation therapy work treat woman locally recurrent breast cancer previously treat repeat breast-conserving surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Women With Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Repeat Breast-Preserving Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate skin , breast , chest wall adverse event occur within 1 year completion 3D-conformal partial-breast re-irradiation follow repeat breast-preserving surgery patient locally recurrent breast carcinoma . Secondary - To evaluate adverse event 1 year time regimen patient . - To evaluate in-breast control rate patient treat regimen . - To evaluate freedom-from-mastectomy rate patient . - To evaluate rate circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) patient population document eradication CTCs locoregional therapy . - To determine whether translational objective correlate eradication presence CTCs in-breast recurrence distant metastasis-free survival . - To evaluate cosmesis judge patient independent evaluation . - To evaluate distant metastasis-free survival , mastectomy-free survival , overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal accelerate partial-breast irradiation twice daily , 5 day week , 3 week . Some patient undergo blood sample collection baseline within 3 week completion radiotherapy circulate tumor cell analysis . Some patient complete questionnaire cosmesis baseline 1 3 year follow radiotherapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 4-5 year every year thereafter .</detailed_description>
