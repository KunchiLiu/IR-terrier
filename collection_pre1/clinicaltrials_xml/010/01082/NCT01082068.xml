	<brief_summary>Phase 1 study evaluate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) XL147 give combination letrozole ( Femara ) XL765 give combination letrozole . After MTD establish combination ( Phase 2 ) , subject enrolled evaluate preliminary efficacy safety combination subject breast cancer refractory non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor ER+/PGR+ HER2- . Letrozole use treatment different type breast cancer , patient develop resistance . Upregulation PI3K activity one common characteristic human cancer cell , include breast tumor cell . Activation PI3K result stimulation AKT mTOR kinase , result promotion tumor cell proliferation survival . Preclinical retrospective clinical data suggest aberrant activation PI3K pathway may play role aromatase inhibitor resistance patient ER+ , HER2- breast cancer . XL147 potent inhibitor PI3K , XL765 potent dual inhibitor PI3K mTOR ; therefore either compound combination letrozole warrant clinical investigation .</brief_summary>
