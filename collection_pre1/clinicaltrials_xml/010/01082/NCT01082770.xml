	<brief_summary>This study randomise control trial examine whether new type needle free access device ( TEGO ) associate less episodes infection dialysis line , compare current gold standard . The investigator hypothesise less handling dialysis line nurse staff thus lead low rate infection . The investigator also assess whether access device lead alteration catheter blood flow rate compare current gold standard .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Infection important cause morbidity mortality patient ESKD . Examining USRDS database , second lead cause death patient . Several study past number year highlight permanent vascular access device independent risk factor development sepsis . Approximately 50 % haemodialysis patient Beaumont Hospital use permanent central catheter , often await alternative vascular access , arterio-venous fistula avenue vascular access exhaust . International data show patient permanent vascular access device 50 % high infection rate compare native fistula . Permanent central venous catheter use haemodialysis tunnel cuffed dual lumen catheter usually compose silicone polyurethane material . These usually place right internal jugular vein . Tunnelled haemodialysis catheter place radiology department fluoroscopic guidance . The presence catheter relate bacteraemia often treat intravenous antibiotic vancomycin gentamycin , however study 100 haemodialysis patient Ann Int Med 1997 show attempt treat bacteraemia without removal catheter usually fail . In case , removal catheter insertion another either another site necessary . Methods reduce catheter relate bacteraemia intensive hygiene education , use cuffed catheter use prophylactic antibiotic therapy employ , however limited success It hypothesise repeat open handle catheter increase risk bacteraemia , close luer lock access device would reduce bacteraemia rate . Several study show reduction catheter bacteraemia close luer lock device use ITU set . Little data exists infection rate patient haemodialysis setting . A recent study NDT examine blood flow resistance close lock access device show value within safe range , suggest device safely use patient haemodialysis setting . Objective To identify closed luer lock access device result low rate bacteraemia and/or sepsis patient receive haemodialysis permanent vascular catheter compare current practise method . Primary End Points : Episodes bacteraemia line sepsis require antibiotic therapy . Bacteraemia define positive blood culture specimen . Bacteraemia define episode temperature &gt; 38º &lt; 36º indication perform blood culture , cellulitis around catheter site . A positive blood culture result label catheter relate bacteraemia obvious source infection note . The physician attending patient reason perform full physical exam request MSU possible patient see aid accuracy result . Secondary End Points : Renal blood flow rate close luer lock device compare standard access device . Renal blood flow rate record haemodialysis nursing staff dialysis session . Incidence line obstruction require thrombolytic therapy close luer lock device compare standard device . Incidence thrombolytic use record attend haemodialysis nurse . This study hypothesise close luer lock access device lead significantly reduce rate catheter related bacteraemia , thus reduce patient morbidity mortality . It also hypothesise renal blood flow rate higher TEGO study group Methods This study design one centre prospective randomise case control study , take place Beaumont Hospital St Martin 's dialysis ward St Peter 's dialysis ward twelve month period . It shall run December 2009 December 2010 , aim recruit 100 patient study , 50 patient control group 50 treatment group . All patient receive fully inform write consent prior enter trial . Patients randomise group use sequentially number , opaque seal envelope . Patients may withdraw study time implication his/her haemodialysis treatment regime . Patients undergo transplantation trial remove study time , data collect time transplantation incorporate study . Inclusion criteria Patients recruit 18 haemodialysis great one month , permanent cuffed vascular access line place receive haemodialysis line three time per week . Patients document episode bacteraemia sepsis great 4 week , use antibiotic coat dialysis line . Exclusion criteria Patients immunosuppressive illness HIV , cancer patient regularly use glucocorticoid . Study group Patients study group use TEGO® device access port , change one week 25 us . This device cost €2.30 , supply gratis Fannin Ltd Dublin ICU Medical Inc , San Clemente USA . TEGO® device access haemodialysis nursing staff use aseptic technique . Control group Patients control group continue receive haemodialysis use current standard care protocol . Data Collection Bacteraemia rate group record haemodialysis nursing staff subsequently inputted Microsoft Excel spreadsheet . Further analysis include comparison patient group take place use SPSS software . Data store hospital server , accessible member research team . The power study calculate use Fisher 's combine probability test , Test Ho : p1=p2 , p1 proportion population 1 p2 proportion population 2 . Assumptions : Alpha = 0.0500 ( two side ) Power = 0.8000 P1 = 0.17 P2 = 0.000 N2/N1 = 1.00 Estimated sample size N1 = 53 N2 = 53 Subsequent data analysis include comparison outcome use student 's test subsequent formation Kaplan Meier curve .</detailed_description>
