	<brief_summary>Liver stiffness measurement ( LSM ) non invasive method increasingly used estimate liver fibrosis patient chronic liver disease . However , grow evidence fibrosis determinant liver stiffness . Indeed inflammation , cholestasis , congestion could also interfere stiffness measurement . Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging ( ARFI ) new technology perform real time LSM . Using standard ultrasonographic probe , offer elastography flexible metering box variable depth , allow examination specific area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging ( ARFI ) : New Technique Assess Liver Elasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There many cause chronic liver disease hepatitis C infection , hepatitis B infection , alcohol , NAFLD ( non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ) , drug auto-immune liver disease . Although cause differ pathological response injury tend similar lead fibrosis cirrhosis . Liver biopsy current gold standard assessment liver fibrosis poorly suit active monitoring expense morbidity . Thus , development alternative safe , inexpensive , reliable priority . Liver stiffness measurement ( LSM ) non invasive method increasingly used estimate liver fibrosis patient chronic liver disease . Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging ( ARFI ) new technology perform real time LSM . Using standard ultrasonographic probe , offer elastography flexible metering box variable depth , allow examination specific area . The purpose work evaluate ARFI , efficiency new technique , reproducibility inter intra observer , liver elasticity obtain method different patient group . The primary endpoint work evaluate ARFI , efficiency technique , reproducibility inter intra observer , elasticity liver 6 different patient group healthy volunteer . The different population group : - healthy volunteer Group A - patient suppose disease free liver ( normal hepatic pancreatic biochemistry ) . Group B - patient non cirrhotic hepatopathy . Group C - patient cirrhosis . Group D - patient liver tumour surgery indication . Group E - patient reversible liver disease : - patient acute left cardiac insufficiency . Group F - patient biliary cholestasis . Group G ARFI measurement perform single liver ultrasound exam visit except patient reversible liver disease second visit ARFI measurement clinical healing . The ARFI value express speed m/s .</detailed_description>
