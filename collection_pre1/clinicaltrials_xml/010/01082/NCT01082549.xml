	<brief_summary>To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient advance squamous cell lung cancer receive combination gemcitabine/carboplatin either without Iniparib . Based data generate BiPar/Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical PARP inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible patient must meet follow criterion enrol study : 1 . Newly diagnose , stage IV squamous cell lung cancer . This include patient present disseminated metastasis , malignant pleural pericardial effusion ( i.e. , formerly stage IIIB 6th TNM stag system ) . 2 . Patients receive prior adjuvant therapy earlystage lung cancer eligible least 12 month elapse treatment . 3 . Histologically confirm squamous cell bronchogenic carcinoma . Patients whose tumor contain mixed nonsmall cell histology eligible , long squamous carcinoma predominant histology . Mixed tumor small cell anaplastic element eligible . Cytologic specimen obtain brushing , washing , needle aspiration define lesion acceptable . 4 . Patients previous radiotherapy definitive therapy locally advance nonsmall cell lung cancer eligible , long recurrence outside original radiation therapy port . Radiation therapy must complete &gt; 4 week prior initiation study treatment . Patients receive chemo/radiation locally advance NSCLC eligible . Patients receive palliative radiation therapy symptomatic metastasis must complete treatment &gt; 14 day prior initiation study treatment . 5 . Presence evaluable ( measureable nonmeasurable ) disease . 6 . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . 7 . Laboratory value follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500/microL platelet &gt; 100,000/microL ( ≤72 hour prior initial treatment ) . Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( Note : Patients may transfuse receive erythropoietin maintain exceed level ) . Bilirubin &lt; ULN . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤2.5 time upper limit normal liver involvement ≤5 time upper limit normal liver involvement . Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL , creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min ( calculate CockcroftGault method . 8 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment . Women childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must use effective birth control measure treatment least 6 month last dose study treatment . If woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study , must agree inform treat physician immediately . Sexually active men must agree use medically acceptable form birth control treatment least 6 month last dose . If female partner become pregnant course study treat physician inform immediately . 9 . &gt; 18 year age . 10 . Ability understand nature study , give write informed consent , comply study requirement . 11 . Patients enter study must willing provide tissue previous tumor biopsy ( available ) correlative testing . An exception national/local regulation prohibits key activity research like export sample third country , storage cod sample global gene expression profile without prespecified list target gene . If tissue available , patient still eligible enrollment study . 1 . Prior treatment gemcitabine , carboplatin ( except adjuvant setting ) , Iniparib . 2 . Past current history neoplasm entry diagnosis , exception treat nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu primary site , invasive cancer treat definitively , treatment end &gt; 5 year previously evidence recurrence . 3 . A history cardiac disease , define : Malignant hypertension Unstable angina Congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction within previous 6 month Symptomatic , unstable uncontrolled , cardiac arrhythmia . Patients stable , ratecontrolled atrial fibrillation eligible study enrollment . 4 . Active brain metastasis . Patients treat brain metastasis eligible , ( 1 ) radiation therapy complete least 2 week prior study entry ; ( 2 ) followup scan show disease progression ; ( 3 ) patient require steroid . 5 . Women pregnant lactating . 6 . Any serious , active infection ( &gt; Grade 2 ) time treatment . 7 . A serious underlying medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . 8 . A major surgical procedure , significant traumatic injury ≤28 day begin treatment , anticipation need major surgery course study . 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , opinion investigator may increase risk associate study participation administration investigational product , may interfere interpretation result . 10 . History medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation administration investigational product , may interfere interpretation result . 11 . Known suspected allergy/hypersensitivity agent give course trial . The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
