	<brief_summary>Being key player Asthma , eosinophils constitute potential target interfere series biological event lead Asthma pathogenesis . In proposal , investigator hypothesize interaction eosinophil airway smooth muscle cell ( ASM ) cell play important role airway remodel . Hence investigator investigate role eosinophil enhance ASM cell proliferation result airway remodel . The investigator also investigate mechanism behind phenomenon . This pave way medical ( drug ) interference one several site order prevent one main potential reason behind airway remodeling , namely eosinophil-derived ASM proliferation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Eosinophils Proliferation Airway Smooth Muscle ( ASM ) Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational hypothesis Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder lung airway associate airway remodel hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) . Its well document smooth muscle mass asthmatic airway increase due hypertrophy hyperplasia ASM cell . Moreover , eosinophil propose different study play major role airway remodel . The association increase eosinophil number asthma severity well document . Here , hypothesize interaction eosinophils ASM cell play important role airway remodel eosinophil modulate airway enhance ASM cell proliferation . Objectives study The aim study examine effect eosinophil ASM cell proliferation use eosinophil isolate asthmatic subject . Specific aim 1 . Effect co-culture ASM cell eosinophils ASM cell proliferation . In specific aim , effect eosinophil ASM cell proliferation study co-culturing eosinophil isolate asthmatic healthy patient ASM cell vitro . This do use non-stimulated eosinophil eosinophil activate Interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) Interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) . ASM proliferation monitor determine level proliferation marker Ki-67 expression ASM cell . Specific aim 2 . Understanding mechanism eosinophil enhance ASM proliferation . In specific aim , study mechanism eosinophils enhance proliferation ASM cell . To study effect eosinophils do direct contact ASM cell , co-culture ASM cell eosinophils membrane fraction . Moreover , examine effect cytokine extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins produce eosinophil smooth muscle cell</detailed_description>
