	<brief_summary>The accumulation fluid behind ear drum without acute inflammation know otitis medium effusion ( OME ) . It common cause acquire hearing loss childhood . Long-term complication OME include linguistic , developmental , social development delay due hearing loss . The cause OME known ; however , low grade infection middle ear , poor function eustachian tube ear throat , adenoid hypertrophy suggest possible etiology . Recent detection stomach enzyme pepsin middle ear fluid lead propose OME relate reflux stomach content ear , via eustachian tube . The purpose investigator study determine whether anti-reflux medication may positive impact clear accumulation fluid middle ear aim prevent reduce hearing loss child diagnose OME . Empiric anti-reflux therapy proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) medication safe , proven cost-effective . It use widely diagnostic treatment strategy presence sign symptom gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . The sign symptom GERD include heartburn , recurrent vomit regurgitation , acid taste mouth , throat irritation , voice problem , heartburn , difficult painful swallowing , asthma recurrent pneumonia . This pilot study double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled trial compare resolution rate OME child treat lansoprazole placebo three month . At end study , patient persistent middle ear effusion bring operate room fluid aspirate sent analysis pepsin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Otitis medium effusion ( OME ) condition characterize accumulation non-purulent fluid middle ear space , absence acute inflammation . OME diagnose 2.2 million time annually ( U.S. Department Health &amp; Human Services , 2000 ) . It condition 50 % child experience first year life ( National Institutes Health , 1993 ) . Although many episode resolve spontaneously , 30 % 40 % persist , 5 % 10 % episode last 1 year longer ( Yoshinaga-Itano , 1995 ) . It particularly common among child age one three year season prevalence upper respiratory tract infection high ; incidence 10 % 30 % . It occur frequently even age seven , prevalence 3 % 8 % ( Fiellau et al , 1997 ; Fiellau et al , 1983 ; Lous et al , 1981 ; Teele et al , 1989 ) . OME common cause acquire hearing loss childhood . Long-term hearing complication OME associate linguistic , developmental , social consequence ; especially OME bilateral long duration ( Fiellau et al , 1983 ; Golz et al , 1998 ; Grace et al , 1990 ; Lous et al , 1995 ) . The etiology OME uncertain ; however , low-grade infection , poor eustachian tube function , formation biofilms , adenoidal infection hypertrophy suggest possible etiology ( Faden et al , 1998 ; Hall-Stoodley et al , 2006 ) . Recently , good scientific evidence suggest OME supraesophageal manifestation gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , specifically laryngo-pharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) . Tasker et al ( 2002 ) investigate potential role gastric reflux development OME child underwent myringotomy . Of 65 tested effusion sample , 59 ( 91 % ) effusion give positive result . The concentration pepsin/pepsinogen roughly estimate 1000 time higher find serum obtain number control . They speculate pepsin find middle ear effusion ( MEE ) probably due micro-aspiration gastric content pass eustachian tube ( ET ) reach middle ear . Lieu et al ( 2005 ) perform pilot study replicate find pepsin/pepsinogen 17 36 ( 77 % ) middle ear fluid aspirate , obtain 22 child underwent tympanostomy tube placement chronic recurrent otitis medium ( OM ) . Based literature review , believe sufficient scientific evidence support empiric treatment suspect GERD LPR patient OME . Empiric anti-reflux therapy safe , proven , cost-effective diagnostic treatment strategy use widely presence sign symptom suspect GERD . This pilot study double-blinded , randomize control trial . It compare hear outcome child OME treat lansoprazole versus placebo three month . We believe sufficient evidence support use strategy patient suspect GERD LPR present OME .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children age 1 17 year refer McMaster Otolaryngology Clinic . Presence bilateral OME least 3 month base : Clinical history : patient may present decrease hearing , aural fullness and/or ear pressure , balance problem , ear tugging/rubbing , typically otalgia fever . Pneumatic otoscopy : observation suggestive OME include presence dull tympanic membrane presence non purulent effusion ( serous mucoid ) , presence level effusion , decrease non motility tympanic membrane , retraction tympanic membrane . Tympanometry : type B type C tympanogram normal air volume external auditory canal . Pure tone audiometry : conductive hearing loss typically vary slight moderate . Presence acute otitis medium determine history physical examination : History rapid acute onset significant otalgia , decrease hearing , fever , irritability . Pneumatic otoscopy reveal purulent effusion , yellowness and/or redness hypervascularity tympanic membrane , bulge tympanic membrane decrease normal landmark . Presence craniofacial abnormality Previous middle ear surgery ( exclude myringotomy tube ) Allergic reaction lansoprazole , adverse drug interaction lansoprazole .</criteria>
