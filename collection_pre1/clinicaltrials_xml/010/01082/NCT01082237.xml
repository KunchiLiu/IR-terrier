	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) common psychiatric illness high cost society individual patient . One reason high cost patient endure lengthy ultimately unsuccessful empiric antidepressant trial successful medication identify trial-and-error . Care would improve biomarker could determine , early course treatment , whether particular antidepressant would likely lead response , remission , treatment failure . Physicians could rapidly change treatment antidepressant biomarker indicate would likely help patient . We identify quantitative electroencephalographic ( QEEG ) change emerge early course treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) appear predict late response remission general adult patient population . Demographic trend United States suggest improve care MDD essential grow number elderly late-life depression . While consequence prolong trial-and-error period find successful treatment particularly inauspicious elder late-life depression , patient group include past study demonstrate use biomarker approach general adult population . We propose 12-week treatment trial evaluate practical biomarker predict outcome base data first week antidepressant treatment , focus depression late life ( age ≥65 ) . There three study Hypothesis : H1 ) ATR prediction treatment outcome old subject show &gt; 70 % accuracy . H2 ) The predictive accuracy model enhance include clinical , socio-demographic , genetic predictor . H3 ) The accuracy ATR prediction show significant dependence subject gender .</brief_summary>
