	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , alemtuzumab , rituximab effective treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient already treat chemotherapy . Primary Objectives : Evaluate therapeutic efficacy , include complete remission ( CR ) , nodular partial remission ( NPR ) , partial remission ( PR ) rate ( overall response ) combine cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , alemtuzumab , rituximab ( CFAR ) previously treat patient Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . Second Objectives : - Assess toxicity profile CFAR previously treat patient CLL . - Monitor infection determine incidence etiology infection include cytomegalovirus patient treat CFAR . - Evaluate molecular remission polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene respond patient treat CFAR . - Assess immune parameter , include pretreatment , treatment , post-treatment blood T-cell count subset distribution serum immunoglobulin level patient treat CFAR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide , Fludarabine , Alemtuzumab , Rituximab ( CFAR ) Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fludarabine chemotherapy drug approve treatment CLL . Cyclophosphamide also chemotherapy drug commonly use treatment CLL . Rituximab alemtuzumab special protein specifically target attach protein leukemia cell . These targeted protein may also present normal blood cell . When drug bind protein leukemia cell , may help stop slow growth disease . The combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide rituximab use treatment CLL . The purpose study determine add benefit addition alemtuzumab combination . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , include blood test ( 3 tablespoon ) . You may either chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan doctor feel necessary . If bone marrow sample collect past 4 month , bone marrow sample collect time . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anaesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . During study , 6 `` cycle '' treatment . A cycle make treatment study drug 5 day row , around 31/2 week ( 23 day ) treatment study drug . On Days 1 , 3 , 5 cycle receive alemtuzumab needle vein . On Day 2 cycle receive rituximab needle vein . Cyclophosphamide fludarabine give separately Days 3 , 4 , 5 cycle needle vein . In addition study drug , may also give fluid vein . The combination treatment repeat every 4 week ( one cycle ) total 6 cycle . This treatment give outpatient basis . The injection daily treatment visit take less 6 hour . You receive acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) mouth diphenhydramine hydrochloride ( Benadryl ) mouth vein 30 - 60 minute dose rituximab alemtuzumab . You also receive hydrocortisone ( steroid ) vein dose alemtuzumab . These drug use help decrease side effect . If side effect occur treatment , dose drug may adjust ( ) symptoms go . Also , experience side effect treatment , must stay clinic 2 hour drug give observe . If begin experience side effect due treatment , dose ( ) drug ( ) may lower treatment may temporarily stop symptom go . During treatment two month completion treatment need take prophylactic antibiotic prevent develop infection . Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( Bactrim DS ) sulfa-drug give prevent type pneumonia call PCP pneumonia . If allergic sulfa drug , equivalent antibiotic give . You take Valtrex prevent virus reactivation include herpes . If allergic Valtrex , equivalent antibiotic give . You may receive additional antibiotic suppress another virus , cytomegalovirus call Valcyte . You may also take allopurinol first week first course treatment . This help prevent kidney damage rapid destruction leukemia cell . During first cycle treatment , blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) blood test week . Then , blood test repeat start additional cycle ( every 4 week ) . After 3 cycle treatment , physical exam blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . You may also either x-ray CT scan . You another bone marrow sample collect . These test use see disease respond treatment . If find disease respond treatment first 3 cycle therapy , take study doctor discus treatment option . If find disease respond treatment , another 3 cycle ( 12 week ) treatment give ( 6 cycle total ) . During additional 3 cycle therapy , blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) week routine blood test . After 6 cycle treatment , physical exam around 2 tablespoon blood drawn routine blood test . Around 3-6 month receive last treatment cycle , physical exam blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . After , physical examination blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) every 6 month next 2 year . If disease return start treatment , need return visit . However , inform study doctor/staff receive treatment . If time study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available . As many 80 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
