	<brief_summary>DNA vaccine consist small piece DNA also known plasmid , several potential advantage traditional vaccine . Thus far , DNA vaccine appear well tolerated human . We develop DNA vaccine , PENNVAX-B , include plasmid target gag , pol , env proteins HIV-1 . The vaccine deliver via electroporation ( EP ) use CELLECTRA constant current device deliver small electric charge follow injection , since animal study show delivery method increase immune response vaccine . The vaccine give HIV-1 infected subject whose viral load undetectable HAART regimen , CD4 lymphocyte count 400 cells/µL blood . It hypothesize PENNVAX-B + EP safe well tolerate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study PENNVAX™-B ( Gag , Pol , Env ) + Electroporation HIV-1 Infected Adult Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single group approximately 12 HIV-infected subject receive 4 dose series PENNVAX-B contain 3 mg DNA/dose study entry ( Day 0 ) , Week 4 , 8 , 16 follow total 48 week .</detailed_description>
