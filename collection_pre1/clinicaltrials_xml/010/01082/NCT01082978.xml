	<brief_summary>The PHF trial ass acceptability long term outcome result usage electronic ( carried patient USB memory device ) paper portable health file population high intensity use medical service . The rationale use portable health file provide conduit direct communication among health care providers patient 's important health care information lead good care patient outcomes . Primary hypothesis : Addition patient-held portable health file ( PHF ) usual care improve patient outcome quality-of-life compare usual care alone . Secondary hypothesis : Addition patient-held portable health file ( PHF ) usual care acceptable satisfactory patient health care provider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Portable Health Files Improve Quality Care Health Outcomes : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A common problem face patient clinicians health system continuity care 'clinical handover ' . Few medical record technology , paper electronic , top bottom , evaluate randomised clinical outcome trial determine clinical benefit cost 'shared ' medical health information . Furthermore , although many study evaluate process care minority within randomized design . Given difference , possibly , small moderate magnitude , give confounders , use randomisation essential design requirement . The first 12 month trial constitute Stage 1 whose primary objective describe acceptability satisfaction Portable Health Files , key process measure . The subsequent 36 month constitute Stage 2 whose primary objective compare important clinical outcome . The assigned treatment ( i.e. , e-PHF p-PHF ) use 4 year total . To take account probable lag effect intervention , patient also follow additional 3 year beyond conclusion randomise trial see longer-term effect . The trial un-blinded potential bias trial conduct potential ascertainment bias determination important clinical outcome quality-of-life . To reduce clinical outcome ascertainment bias blind Adjudication Committee make determination out-of-hospital event `` serious '' . The primary outcome : mortality overnight hospitalization objective outcome subject ascertainment bias . Secondary outcome include quality life , quality measure uptake , investigation , medication use , medication error , adverse drug reaction . Utilities cost also collect cost-effectiveness analysis . Patient provider acceptability satisfaction PHFs also collect . All primary analysis undertaken mask randomized arm allocation . Most secondary analysis include quality life , quality measure uptake , investigation , medication use , medication error , adverse drug reaction , health utility , health care utilisation health care cost also undertake masked randomized arm allocation . This Adjudication Committee also monitor trial safety scientific integrity .</detailed_description>
