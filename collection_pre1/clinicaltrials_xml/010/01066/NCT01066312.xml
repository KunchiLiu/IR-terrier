	<brief_summary>Manual Muscle Testing ( MMT ) practice million practitioner worldwide . However , 's accuracy varying level blindness yet consider . This study test accuracy . Study Hypothesis : MMT accurately distinguish congruent incongruent statement . Also , accuracy MMT positively correlate practitioner experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Accuracy Manual Muscle Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Manual Muscle Testing non-invasive assessment tool use million healthcare practitioner worldwide variety purpose . First describe literature Lovett Wight 1915 , MMT originally use assess muscular weakness polio victim . In 1949 , physiotherapists Kendall Kendall refine MMT art science publication benchmark text , Muscles : Testing Function . This type MMT still use today ass neuromuscular integrity . In 1960 's , different use MMT describe Dr. George Goodheart . In Goodheart 's technique , call Applied Kinesiology ( AK ) , MMT use evaluate variety additional function body , apart neuromuscular integrity . From Goodheart 's work , many different technique emerge use second type MMT . Moreover , estimate one million healthcare practitioner worldwide use type MMT : medical doctor , dentist , chiropractor , osteopath , physiotherapist , health professional - plus even lay-persons . As result divergence , exist two different form MMT : ( 1 ) orthopaedic muscle test quantify muscle strength asses neurological integrity , ( 2 ) type muscle test - call call `` muscle response test '' use obtain additional information patient . What information depend upon MMT system use information sought . It latter form MMT propose study investigate . Therefore , remainder application , term `` MMT '' use refer second type ( `` muscle response test '' ) . The basic premise MMT aberrant nervous system input muscle , less likely able resist external force . During manual muscle test , external force apply one muscle group muscle first cause isometric eccentric contraction . Consequently , muscle test labelled `` weak '' `` strong '' base ability resist external force . A number different technique use MMT test body 's physiological response semantic stimulus , may cognitive emotional component . Monti et al . find MMT follow congruent statement yield significantly different result compare MMT follow incongruent statement . A congruent statement one person believe true . An incongruent statement one person believe false . The study Monti et al . use self-referential statement similar study design , however used statement , `` My name ( insert one 's name ) '' . One criticism use type self-referential statement likelihood muscle tester muscle testee know verity statement , therefore , unblinded , may introduce bias . While generally accept use assessment tool bias exist MMT , little currently know degree bias . Therefore main objective study investigate accuracy MMT distinguish congruent incongruent statement vary degree blindness . A aim study explore practitioner experience correlate MMT accuracy . Caruso Leisman report great MMT accuracy experience practitioner compare inexperienced practitioner . Therefore , study test reproducibility finding . There two group participant select study : ( 1 ) Practitioners , ( 2 ) Testees - Practitioner perform MMT Testee Testee speak statement . The Testee know s/he speak true false statement . However , statement , Practitioner blind verity statement . Results analyse percent correct - , percent muscle test accurately predict verity speak statement .</detailed_description>
