The startle reflex basic defensive reaction modulate emotional stimulus . The investigation startle reflex modulation well-validated method test stress reaction emotional regulation . These process impair psychiatric disease , OXT dysfunction evidence . Although previous animal study show dysfunction brain OXT system might implicate startle reflex modulation , study perform yet human investigate influence OXT administration startle response affective modulation . A first aim study investigate influence OXT stress reactivity emotional modulation healthy human . A second aim develop method investigation anxiety disorder . Fifty male healthy participant test use randomize double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design two occasion ; administration 24 IU OXT , placebo use nasal spray perform computer-based experiment , emotional picture auditory startle probe present . We measure subject 's subjective rating picture well facial EMG activation , heart rate electrodermal activation throughout study . This project offer unique opportunity study relationship OXT system basic motivational emotional behavior . The investigation mechanism turn greatly worthwhile , understanding neurochemical physiological process involve emotional regulation , also comprehension neuroendocrine neurophysiological mechanismsunderlying anxiety disorder . In long term , could open possibility OXT psychobiological therapeutic psychiatric disorder .</brief_summary>
