	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study measure level enzyme patient 's heart call inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image radioactive tracer call 18F-NOS . These PET result compare tissue result obtain routine endomyocardial heart biopsy . The enzyme iNOS produce nitric oxide inflammatory disease acute heart transplant rejection , diabetes , Alzheimer 's cancer . Thus , PET radioactive tracer 18F-NOS may useful tool detect early stage disease . The safety 18F-NOS study also assess . All PET image perform CTI/Siemens Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner . Protocol revise add new image modality , Biograph mMR PET-MR scanner order investigate new hardware software order optimize scan procedure order refine image quality apply finding future standard clinical scan research image study . Ten additional status-post OHT patient schedule standard care endomyocardial biopsy allograft rejection surveillance undergo PET/MR image [ 18F ] ( +/- ) NOS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) important unique mediator variety physiological pathological process . NO generated oxidation L-arginine L-citrulline two-step process nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) enzymes . In NOS family , two constitutive isozymes NOS , neuronal NOS ( nNOS ) endothelial NOS ( eNOS ) , one inducible isozyme ( iNOS ) . The three isozymes NOS express different tissue generate NO specific physiological role . nNOS generate NO neurotransmitter neuromodulator , mainly brain peripheral nerve cell ; eNOS regulate blood pressure , blood flow primarily vascular endothelial cell . The induction iNOS occur various inflammatory stimulus ( e.g. , endotoxin ) activate macrophage type cell play crucial role host defense inflammatory process . Normally , basal level NO part body low , mainly due constitutive nNOS eNOS . In contrast , express , iNOS continue generate NO large amount ( Î¼M concentration ) prolong period time . Studies show production NO iNOS implicate variety acute chronic inflammatory disease ( e.g. , sepsis , septic shock , organ transplant rejection , vascular dysfunction diabetes , asthma , arthritis , multiple sclerosis , inflammatory disease gut ) . iNOS activity also find many tumor . Because central role iNOS NO-related disease , numerous effort make develop iNOS inhibitor pharmaceutical range nonselective L-arginine analogue selective inhibitor report recently . Some inhibitor iNOS show promising result animal model sepsis , lung inflammation , arthritis , autoimmune diabetes . Therefore , development radiolabeled iNOS inhibitor probe iNOS expression vivo use noninvasive positron emission tomography ( PET ) image tremendous value study treatment NO-related disease . Acute allograft rejection major contributor mortality patient receive orthotopic heart transplantation ( OHT ) . Specifically , iNOS think main NOS involve produce NO active acute cardiac allograft rejection . Up-regulation iNOS occur macrophage cellular infiltrates later within graft parenchymal cell . In human cardiac transplantation positive correlation show iNOS expression leave ventricular contractile dysfunction measure echocardiography Doppler technique . We recently develop novel PET radiotracer , [ 18F ] ( +/- ) NOS , design measure cellular iNOS activity . This study evaluate feasibility method OHT patient undergo surveillance endomyocardial biopsy part normal post-transplant evaluation potential allograft rejection . More specifically , compare myocardial kinetics radiotracer measure PET tissue measurement iNOS measure immunohistochemistry .</detailed_description>
