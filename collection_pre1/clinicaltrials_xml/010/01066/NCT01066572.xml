	<brief_title>Paramedic Initiated Lisinopril For Acute Stroke Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High blood pressure immediately follow stroke common related poor stroke functional outcome death . Although treatment high blood pressure well establish thre prevention stroke , unclear high blood pressure observe immediately stroke lower . Several previous clinical trial lower blood pressure acute stroke result improved stroke outcome . One reason may treatment start late stroke occur . There rapid progression brain injury follow stroke stroke treatment may need start early beneficial effect . Previous trial start blood pressure lower patient arrived hospital usually significant time stroke occur . The early time stroke blood pressure treatment could start contact emergency medical service ( paramedic ) . This research study pilot double blind randomise control trial paramedic initiate blood pressure treatment patient high blood pressure immediately stroke . Patients high blood pressure suspect acute stroke identify offer opportunity participate study research train paramedic North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust . Patients agree participate study receive either lisinopril ( common blood pressure lower medication ) 'dummy ' ( placebo ) treatment seven day . The first dose medication give paramedic ambulance . Subsequent tablet give hospital . The effect treatment monitor measure blood pressure , neurological outcome adverse event . All aspect study feasibility include recruitment rate compliance data collection record . The study run one year recruit 60 patient .</detailed_description>
