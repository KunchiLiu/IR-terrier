	<brief_summary>Several people world suffer cartilage injury knee . Symptoms include pain , joint swelling , loss function . Without repair , cartilage injury may ultimately lead osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Natural heal poor , date treatment available deep cartilage defect involve also underlie bone . A promising candidate drug treatment cartilage injury sprifermin ( AS902330 ) , recombinant form human fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) 18 . So far , drug use subject different stage knee OA two ongoing study without emerge safety issue follow single multiple intra-articular injection ascend dos . However , OA represent late-stage cartilage injury , repair might difficult due diffuse damage , reduce responsiveness cartilage , and/or involvement joint structure . This clinical trial mean provide proof concept identify efficacious dose sprifermin ( AS902330 ) treatment adult subject acute cartilage injury knee . The first subject trial treat 19th April 2010 .</brief_summary>
