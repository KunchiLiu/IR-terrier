	<brief_summary>Vasculitis group diseases inflammation blood vessel common feature . Patients typically present fever , fatigue , weakness muscle joint ache . These symptom common among many different disease , vasculitis . A clustering symptom , physical examination finding , blood test , radiology biopsy help make diagnosis . There currently criterion help doctor make diagnosis vasculitis patient present non specific symptom reliant previous experience disease definition . One aim project develop diagnostic criterion primary systemic vasculitides ( granulomatosis polyangiitis ( Wegener 's ) , microscopic polyangiitis , Churg Strauss syndrome , polyarteritis nodosa , giant cell arteritis , Takayasu arteritis ) . We , investigator , study large group patient vasculitis compare large group patient present similar way , vasculitis . By compare 2 group create list item differentiate vasculitis 'vasculitis mimic ' . We also aim update current classification criterion . Classification criterion use group patient different type vasculitis , diagnosis vasculitis make , useful study patient clinical trial similar identical disease . The current classification criterion ( American college Rheumatology 1990 criterion ) develop 20 year ago , availability important diagnostic test ( e.g . antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ ANCA ] ) , consistent current disease definition . Therefore progress future research vasculitis , important classification criterion update . We recruit 260 patient 6 type vasculitis compare 1300 control ( patient 5 type vasculitis ) , order determine optimal combination symptom , sign investigation classify person appropriate group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The systemic vasculitides group uncommon important disease whose prognosis improve dramatically use immunosuppressive therapy . However , long-term morbidity recurrent disease flare , low-grade grumbling disease and/or accumulate damage previous disease activity drug therapy characterise long-term outlook patient vasculitis . There remain major controversy , incompatibility ANCA-associated vasculitides : granulomatosis polyangiitis ( Wegener 's ) , microscopic polyangiitis , Churg Strauss Syndrome , well polyarteritis nodosa current classification criterion disease definition . Importantly , diagnostic criterion primary systemic vasculitides . We propose improve exist classification criterion primary systemic vasculitides . As start point include follow disease : granulomatosis polyangiitis ( Wegener 's ) ( GPA ) , microscopic polyangiitis ( MPA ) , Churg Strauss syndrome ( CSS ) , polyarteritis nodosa ( PAN ) , giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) Takayasu arteritis ( TAK ) . We propose develop validate classification diagnostic criterion primary systemic vasculitis use guideline suggest Classification Response Criteria Subcommittee American College Rheumatology Committee Quality Measures . For patient , detailed medical history , physical examination , laboratory test ( include ANCA ) , radiology ( include angiography ) , biopsy result , treatment , Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score ( BVAS ) version 3 , Vasculitis Damage Index ( VDI ) , collect . The exact list item record determine expert panel start study . Classification criterion We study minimum 100 patient ( new exist patient ) prospectively within currently define disease category ( GPA , CSS , MPA , PAN , GCA , TAK ) development classification criterion . We anticipate need recruit 130 patient account misdiagnosis dropout achieve target 100 confirm reference diagnosis . This include patient vasculitis assume related ANCA fulfil current definition disease , patient large vessel vasculitis fulfil current definition GCA TAK . Therefore new category disease may create part process current disease category may change include exclude certain patient . The disease control . The minimum number patient use validate criterion . The 1st 100 patient formal reference diagnosis recruit disease use development classification criterion ; next 100 consecutive patient recruit confirmed reference diagnosis disease use validate criterion . Again anticipate need recruit 130 patient account misdiagnosis dropout achieve 100 target . The majority case include use development diagnostic criterion . In absence establish gold standard , propose develop reference standard . Clinical vignette use cluster clinical feature investigation construct actual case steer group . An expert panel ask classify vignette . Hypothetical change make component clinical vignette expert panel ask classify case . This process repeat multiple time attempt determine key clinical feature influence expert panel change diagnosis . Using data driven process , construct important clinical feature disease determine expert panel . Using new construct , patient classify expert panel . This form reference standard new criterion test . Diagnostic Criteria We propose develop validate diagnostic criterion primary systemic vasculitis . Based current disease category include GPA , MPA , CSS , PAN , GCA TAK ( may change depend whether new category create exist category merge part classification criterion component ) . For development diagnostic criterion , study minimum 100 patient ( require approx 130 patient allow dropout misdiagnosis ) disease category . Assuming 6 disease category , majority 780 patient already identify classification criterion component study use development validation diagnostic criterion . However , diagnostic criterion clinically relevant include patient see time 1st presentation , therefore 780 patient recruit classification criterion section study suitable , need recruit additional new patient type vasculitis study . We use minimum 400 context specific control ( patient n't vasculitis ) AAV PAN cover spectrum different disease presentation severity . In addition , recruit minimum 100 context specific control GCA similar number TAK . Different control population need AAV , GCA TAK significantly different clinical presentation . In similar manner case , recruit 30 % patient minimum required account misdiagnosis drop . The minimum number case control needed validate criterion . The first half patient recruit would use develop criterion , 2nd half validate criterion . We allow inclusion patient previously study prospective cohort meet appropriate inclusion / exclusion criterion appropriate clinical information mandatory investigation ( define later ) record time first presentation . This facilitate recruitment sufficient patient PAN , CSS TAK rare condition . Statistical analysis We follow ACR recommend statistical method create classification criterion . Patients classify different type vasculitis accord propose EULAR/ACR schema expert panel vasculitis mimic . The outcomes interest binary variable indicate whether patient classify particular type vasculitis , GPA , MPA , etc . For outcome , multivariable logistic regression model use identify predictor outcome base list potential predictor variable describe earlier . We also explore use Classification And Regression Tree ( CART ) analysis . This tree-building technique ideally suit generation clinical decision rule . Unlike conventional regression method , patient partition ( `` split '' ) different group base exhaustive search possible predictor variable . The advantage CART analysis conventional method non-parametric , assumption make underlie distribution predictor variable . CART handle many hundred possible predictor variable uncover complex interaction predictor may difficult impossible uncover use traditional multivariate technique suffer model fitting . In addition , clinician generally think term probability rather term category , low versus high risk . Clinical decision rule generate use CART analysis likely make clinical sense , hence likely follow clinical practice . Once best item identify , expert panel decide best short list item include criterion also choose appropriate decision tree . This provide best content validity . The statistical method use diagnostic criterion similar use classification criterion . The binary outcome analysis whether person case control ( without vasculitis ) . We repeat analysis type vasculitis e.g . WG versus control , CSS versus control etc</detailed_description>
