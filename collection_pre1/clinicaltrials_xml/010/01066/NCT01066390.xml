	<brief_summary>This phase I study plan divide follow four phase : - Eligibility Screen Phase ( week -4 -1 ) : Following write informed consent patient metastatic melanoma ( AJCC stage III/IV unresectable disease ) undergo eligibility screen ( incl . blood analysis PET/CT-scan ) . - TriMix-DC Vaccine Manufacturing Phase ( week I IV ) : eligible patient undergo leucapheresis ( 15 liter venous blood ) preparation autologous TriMix-DC vaccine . Vaccine preparation manufacture quality-controlled ( interval 4 week follow leucapheresis ) release patient administration TriMix-DC preparation fulfills predefined quality requirement . - TriMix-DC Vaccine Administration Phase ( Week 1 24 ) : 4 week leucapheresis patient initiate therapeutic vaccination TriMix-DC vaccine IV ID administration . The vaccine administer 4 different visit separate interval 2 week . At vaccination total 12.106 DC per antigen administer . - Patients allocate three different cohort : - The first cohort receive 10 % TriMix-DC iv 90 % id injection . - The second cohort 25 % iv 75 % id injection . - The third cohort 50 % iv 50 % id injection . - During week follow administration fourth vaccine ( = week 8 ) , DTH-test punch biopsy injection site perform well second leucapheresis ( purpose immuno-monitoring ) tumor evaluation ( PET-CT ) . - A fifth vaccine administer repeat tumor stag perform week 16 ( = 8w fourth vaccine ) . - End study visit : Patients perform `` end study visit '' 8 week fifth vaccine ( = week 24 ) well new tumor evaluation ( PET/CT ) . - Follow-up Phase : survival data obtain 3 year initiation vaccine therapy time death .</brief_summary>
