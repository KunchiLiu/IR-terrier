	<brief_summary>The aim propose work conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluation behavior change intervention design enhance fluid-intake adherence ( compliance ) among hemodialysis patient . Patient non-adherence ( non-compliance ) fluid-intake restriction highly pervasive problem hemodialysis population substantial consequence term increase patient morbidity mortality . Given prevalence clinical importance adherence among ESRD patient , design evaluation intervention improve patient adherence critically important . Surprisingly , however , little empirical work conduct area . The propose RCT involve test efficacy behaviorally base , group-administered , `` behavioral self regulation '' intervention design increase adherence fluid intake restriction among hemodialysis patient . This structured intervention design deliver healthcare provider clinical set group 4-10 patient seven , one-hour weekly session . This study compare effect structure intervention group effect educational support group fluid-intake adherence sample approximately 200 fluid non-adherent center hemodialysis patient 26-week follow-up period . Both clinical ( interdialysis session weight gain ) self-report index fluid-intake adherence examine . We believe propose research potentially high impact give high prevalence clear clinical consequence hemodialysis patient nonadherence potential relatively low-cost , structured intervention significantly reduce type maladaptive patient behavior hemodialysis treatment context .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upon consent enrollment study , patient give packet questionnaire take home , complete , return use postage-paid envelope . These questionnaire include patient background form , include information age , gender , marital status , year education , employment status , race/ethnicity , two measure health belief attitude ( Krantz Health Opinion Survey Multidimensional Health Locus Control Scale . A copy measure attach application . Following consent randomization participant assign one two comparison study arm . Both study arm involve participation weekly , hour-long , patient support group seven week . As described group differ term content focus . Patients randomly assign Self-Regulation arm meet group 4-10 participant usual hemodialysis clinic hour-long weekly session seven week . Two four group conduct participate center depend center size . Groups lead member UIHC research team least two year previous professional experience behavior change technique , least two year previous experience hemodialysis population , master 's doctoral level degree psychology . Each UIHC team group leader responsible 3-4 group duration project . Session material utilized group-leaders highly structure detailed across seven session . Self-Regulation group session generally highly leader-directed though participant regularly encourage share experience deal dialysis regimen . A consistent attempt make focus group discussion self-regulatory principle relate treatment adherence . An outline topic Self-Regulation group attach . Patients randomly assign Support Discussion arm also meet group 4-10 participant usual hemodialysis clinic hour-long weekly session seven week . Two four group conduct participate center depend center size . These group also lead member UIHC research team , group leader responsible 3-4 group duration project . The Support Discussion protocol consist two integrated component : ( ) brief educational material present start session , ( b ) group leader facilitate discussion follow presentation educational material . An outline topic Support Discussionn group also attach . Patient adherence fluid-intake regimen determine compute amount weight patient gain dialysis treatment session ( term `` interdialytic weight gain '' IWG ) record patient 's regular medical record . Mean IWG average two week ( six session ) assessment point serve primary dependent measure study . The pre-enrollment assessment ( Time 0 ) comprise two week immediately precede start group meeting , Time 1 comprise two week immediately follow final intervention session , Time 2 comprise 12th 13th post-intervention week Time 3 assessment consist 25th 26th post-intervention week . Patients also ask complete previously validate self-report assessment hemodialysis patient adherence fluid restriction ( Dialysis Diet Fluid Non-Adherence Questionnaire ) . This measure assess fluid-intake adherence previous two week obtain schedule parallel collection clinical IWG data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients deem eligible mean ( average preceeding four week ) preenrollment , interdialysis weight gain ( IWG ) great 2.5 kg . Other inclusion criterion include receive hemodialysis minimum three month , patient age 18 year , English speaking . Patients reside nursing home/longterm care facility exclude participation primarily due likelihood diminish patient selfmanagement diet fluid intake setting .</criteria>
