	<detailed_description>The number people age 65 year expect rise 60 % next 25 year , present enormous challenge healthcare system . Ageing dramatically affect immune functionÍ¾ phenomenon know immunosenescence partly explain increased susceptibility infection old individual . Influenza particularly common old individual major cause death old people . Vaccination recommend protect elderly people influenza , immunosenescence also reduce efficacy vaccination . It estimate 3050 % old adult fail mount protective antibody response influenza vaccination , represent considerable waste resource false sense security receive vaccination . Probiotics show promise prevention treatment several disease state range lactose intolerance , constipation diarrhoea , alleviation allergy even chronic systemic disease , cardiovascular disease cancer . Often take together prebiotics , carbohydrate provide food source beneficial bacteria reach low gut . There particular interest positive influence pre- probiotic old people , subject alteration gut microflora composition well immunosenescence . Several study demonstrate beneficial effect specific pre- probiotic immune function old subject . However , none study take account agerelated shift immune cell population . Furthermore , little understanding mechanism underlying effect . Despite , probiotic recently propose prime candidate 'antiimmunosenescence ' therapy . We propose investigate impact pre- probiotic mix immune response influenza vaccination young old subject , take account age related shift immunity due immunosenescence . The inclusion young old group subject allow u ascertain whether old individual derive particular benefit probiotic alter gut microbiota immune status . This proposal bring together unique combination expertise nutrition , gut health immunology determine scientific basis immunomodulatory effect pre- probiotic . The chief investigator , Dr Parveen Yaqoob , work area diet , health , age immune function 18 year . Professor Ian Rowland work interaction diet gut microbiota implication human health 30 year . Dr Kieran Tuohy appoint Lecturer Food Metabonomics Department Food Biosciences 2005 ten year experience field gut microbiology functional food . Professor Margot Gosney Director Clinical Health Sciences , The University Reading clinician work elderly care Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust , Reading . Her research interest include association nutrition health elderly people , age , oncology , dental science stroke patient , influenza , incontinence , fall intellectual decline . Dr Sue Todd Reader Medical Statistics University Reading 15 year experience apply statistician work field clinical trial epidemiology , particular interest sequential clinical trial , Data Safety Monitoring Boards statistical method epidemiology . Professor Richard Aspinall work hypothesis age relate change T cell arm immune system drive age associate thymic atrophy . The Chief Investigator project researcher direct personal involvement funding organisation ( BBSRC DRINC ) therefore conflict interest . The result study also contribute PhD thesis two postgraduate student . Healthy volunteer ( 60 young [ 1835y ] 60 old [ 6585y ] ) randomly assign either pre-and probiotic mix placebo ( maltodextrin/milk mix ) 8 week total . The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium longum bv . infantis CCUG 52486 ( 10^8 10^9 live bacteria per day ) , originally isolate healthy elderly subject , demonstrate particular ecological fitness antipathogenic effect vitro . A suitable prebiotic ( 8g/day ) select basis ability promote optimal growth survival probiotic ( inulin , fructooligosaccharides [ FOS ] , galactooligosaccharides [ GOS ] xylooligosaccharides [ XOS ] test ) . The pre- probiotic mix placebo sachet manufacture package University Reading pilot plant , test Reading Scientific Services Limited safety . This project assess vaccine efficacy basis specific antibody titre cellular responsiveness . Participants require visit Department Food Nutritional Sciences 5 occasion screen 4 time study ( 0 , 4 , 6 8 week ) . The screen visit involve detail medical history several assessment conduct Research Nurse , make visit approximately 2 hour duration . The study visit shorter ( approximately 1 hour ) , involve discussion study , identify problem concern collection biological sample . Blood ( 150ml ) , saliva faecal sample collect baseline 4 week supplementation . After sample , subject receive influenza vaccination ( Solvay Pharmaceuticals ) sample collect 2 4 week vaccination .</detailed_description>
