	<brief_summary>In research study start look high dose pyrimethamine give safely CLL patient without severe unmanageable side effect . This dose use large Phase II study ass efficacy pyrimethamine treatment CLL/SLL . Pyrimethamine antibiotic use treatment certain infection . Previous research study show pyrimethamine may target protein tumor cell , call STAT3 , may important growth chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) cell . Pyrimethamine kill CLL/SLL cell laboratory , therefore undertake study ass whether pyrimethamine result clinical benefit tumor response CLL patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants require enroll DFCI Protocol 99-224 , CLL Research Consortium Tissue Bank , DFCI Protocol 01-206 , Tissue Data Collection Research Studies Patients Hematologic Malignancies , Bone Marrow Disorders , Normal Donors , may blood banked future use . - Each treatment cycle last 28 day time participant take pyrimethamine orally per day . Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect , everyone participates receive dose study drug . - The following test procedure perform specific time point participation study : Physical exam , vital sign , blood test bone marrow biopsy . The participant 's tumor assess CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis prior start study end 1st , 3rd 6th month . - Participants continue receive pyrimethamine long side effect disease worsen .</detailed_description>
