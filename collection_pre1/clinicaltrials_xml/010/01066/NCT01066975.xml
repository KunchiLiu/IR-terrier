	<brief_summary>Soldiers recreational backpacker often require carry heavy load body military operation hike . Despite advance backpack design , load carry soldier still impose extreme physiological strain ( soft tissue deformation ) frequently result discomfort , pain , musculoskeletal injury , loss sensorimotor function . In current study , characterization pressure , evaluation deformation soft tissue , specifically fat , muscle , Brachial plexus subclavian vessel apply shoulder sit heavy backpack perform . The data acquire current trial use development finite element ( FE ) 3D shoulder model . The purpose good understand mechanical load transfer underlying tissue shoulder strap walking/marching backpack . During 2nd phase project , data collect research use develop gear alleviate strain shoulder , prevent injury , enhance performance . Hypothesis - High focal strain ( hot-spots ) shoulder tissue observe pressure mapping observe also MR scan . - The strain hot-spots reduce personal-geometry adjust strap . Volunteers Five young ( 18-30 yr ) , healthy , fit male participate study . Trials design 1 . MR Scans- The scan performed analysis personal shoulder anatomy , use develop 3D FE model . The sagittal view use develop 3D model . The coronal axial sectional view use assess deformation apply shoulder tissue . The scan repeat carry 25 kg standard commercial backpack sit position , assessment shoulder girdle tissue deformation . Time estimation scan 40 min ( 80 min total ) . The subject require carry backpack prior scan . 2 . Static pressure measurement- volunteer ask sit 30 second carry 25 kg backpack . During session , pressure measure use pressure mapping pad ( Sensor Products Inc. , USA ) place shoulder strap underlie tissue . The maximal total participation time volunteer 2 hour total ( inside outside MR ) . Data acquire current trial use development FE ( finite element ) 3D shoulder model . MR scan utilized compose geometry boundary condition assessment ( strain magnitude ) . Pressure measurement use boundary condition ( stress magnitude ) . MR scan pressure measurement perform Sheba medical center facility .</brief_summary>
