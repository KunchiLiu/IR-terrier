	<brief_summary>Studies establish somatosensory system upper cervical region head intimately involved tinnitus . Tinnitus arise directly disorder head upper neck via somatosensory system . Our clinical experience review report various type treatment support hypothesis treatment modality involve somatosensory system benefit individual whose tinnitus likely somatosensory basis , namely people symmetric hear threshold asymmetric widely fluctuate tinnitus . However previous study ( ) limit treatment population people tinnitus somatosensory basis ( b ) ass result consider tinnitus subpopulation separately entire group tinnitus subject treat . Hence , purpose study re-assess treatment target people whose audiograms account tinnitus , individual symmetric hear threshold asymmetric widely fluctuate tinnitus</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Until recently attempt year treatment patient type tinnitus meet little success . These treatment include cervical physical therapy dental treatment bruxism . A tinnitus respond benefit acupuncture apply periauricular region . A small formal trial patient provide relief . However literature review ( Levine et al. , 2007 ) find consistent line evidence tinnitus subgroup responsive somatosensory base treatment modality , include electrical stimulation periauricular region , acupuncture . Furthermore electrical stimulation device auricle P-Stim find effective standard acupuncture variety condition , include chronic cervical low back pain . For convergence reason initiate open trial P-Stim past 11 month . In sense use `` off-label '' capacity ; many medication find useful condition medication develop ( see Levine 2006 ) . The P-Stim battery-powered , transcutaneous electrical stimulator delivers 1 per second bipolar 1 millisecond pulse three point auricle . The device connects via three fine insulate stainless steel wire three needle ( 0.4 mm diameter , 2 mm long ) apply three different point auricle . The device power three zinc air battery , voltage 1.4 V. The device 180 minute , 180 minute , maximum period 96 hour . The battery electronics contain 6 mm 2.5 mm pack one adhesive surface apply skin behind ear . The adhesive conductive act return device . The battery pack secure tape . We meet success use P-Stim appear two tinnitus subgroup : somatic pulsatile tinnitus syndrome ( Levine et al. , 2008 ) patient non-pulsatile unilateral fluctuating tinnitus associate deep ear pain .</detailed_description>
