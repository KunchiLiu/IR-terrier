	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis inflammation oral mucous membrane , tissue line mouth . Oral mucositis cause chemotherapy attack kill rapidly-dividing cell oral mucous membrane . This condition feel like sunburn ( heartburn ) mucous tissue , often lead sore mouth tongue . This cause discomfort , pain , difficulty eat , long hospital stay . Several therapy appear either prevent reduce severity mouth ulcer cause chemotherapy multiple myeloma . Different strategy use try prevent condition ; small number trial find strategy may effective . None trial compare head head use saline solution ( standard care ) , cryotherapy ( ice chip ) Caphosol patient receive high-dose melphalan . The goal research study evaluate effectiveness saline solution , cryotherapy , Caphosol prevention oral mucositis patient multiple myeloma receive high-dose chemotherapy follow autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The researcher hope learn difference among saline solution , cryotherapy Caphosol mouth rinse prevention oral mucositis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Trial Cryotherapy Versus Caphosol Versus Saline Solution Mouth Washes Prevention Oral Mucositis Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Study design This single center , prospective , randomize , comparative study evaluate effectiveness saline solution , cryotherapy Caphosol mouth rinse prevention oral mucositis . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient eligible autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) least 18 year age screen enroll approximately 165 patient . During study patient receive prophylactic fluconazole , acyclovir antibiotic appropriate ( standard care ) . Systemic analgesia give control oral pain result mucositis group require . All treatment group receive identical oral hygiene care instruction . Treatments permit study include GM-CSF , palifermin ( Kepivance ) mouthwash oral coat agent Gelclair study period reduce confound factor . All patient receive high-dose melphalan 100 mg /m2/day 2 day ( day -2 -1 ) condition regimen follow autologous HSCT ( day 0 ) . After informed consent completion screen period , patient randomize three arm . Randomization stratify patient age , sex , performance status . Patients monitor daily post-conditioning patient discharge hospital admit intensive care unit . The oral mucosa examine trained study staff . Oral mucositis assess daily hospital discharge , first day melphalan , patient develop oral mucositis oral mucositis resolve patient develop mucositis maximum 30 day . The oral mucositis assess use World Health Organization ( WHO ) Mucositis Scale , Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale ( OMAS ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Toxicity Criteria . At time mucositis-related pain ( mouth pain ) evaluate base Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale Numeric Rating Scale ( Appendix B ) . Questionnaire Patient-reported Oral Mucositis Symptoms ( PROMS ) Scale obtain screen every day first day melphalan end study . All patient receive Program 's standard oral hygiene instruction prior initiation study . ARM # 1 : Standard care prevention management oral mucositis ( 0.9 % Sodium Chloride irrigation solution ) : Patients randomize group instruct rinse mouth twice , 1 ounce ( 30 ml ) room temperature 0.9 % NaCl ( normal saline ) , 4 time daily admission end study . ARM # 2 : Cryotherapy ( ice chip ) : Patients randomize group , day -2 -1 , instruct place approximately 1 ounce crush ice mouth 15 minute prior initiation melphalan infusion . The ice allow melt replenish soon completely melt . Patients instructed continue procedure melphalan infusion 90 minute end infusion . After patient do cryotherapy follow standard care prevention management oral mucositis end study . ARM # 3 : Calcium phosphate ( Caphosol ) Ca2+/PO43- mouth rinse : Patients randomize group instruct rinse mouth Caphosol 4 time daily admission end study . All patient , develop oral mucositis pain , follow Bone Marrow Transplant Program standard care control pain patient undergo HDC autologous HSCT . The Program standard care oral mucositis pain consist use triple mix solution ( lidocaine , Maalox , diphenhydramine ) analgesic . Patients Caphosol rinse arm develop severe mucositis instruct rinse 10 time day .</detailed_description>
