	<brief_title>Improvement Humoral Immune Response With Hemodialysis BK-F Membrane : Correlation Soluble CD40 Clearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic renal failure associate humoral immune alteration characterize diminished vaccine response notably hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Defects cellular contact immunological cell hypothesize explain observation precise mechanism lead `` immunocompromised '' status clear . The soluble form CD40 ( sCD40 ) dramatically increase serum uremic patient , particularly hemodialyzed patient . This molecule act like inhibitor CD40/CD154 contact , pivotal establishment proper humoral immune response . It show elevated sCD40 level associate lack response HBV vaccination hemodialyzed patient . The majority hemodialysis membrane , include high flux polysulfone membrane unable clear sCD40 serum . However , find high flux polymethylmetacrylate ( PMMA ) membrane ( BK-F Toray Medical Company , Japan ) allow sCD40 clearing . The aim study assess effect dialysis PMMA membrane improvement humoral immune response efficiency HBV vaccination hemodialysed patient non responder one ore previous vaccination link sCD40 clearing .</detailed_description>
