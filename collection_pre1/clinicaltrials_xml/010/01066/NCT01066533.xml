	<brief_title>Immunohistochemical Study Human Teeth Pulp Capped With Mineral Trioxide Aggregate ( MTA ) Novel Endodontic Cement ( NEC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capping expose pulp indicate reversible pulp tissue injury physical mechanical trauma develop mature teeth.The response direct pulp cap material MTA NEC formation dentin barrier , result recruitment proliferation undifferentiated cell . Different material use induce dentinal bridge formation.MTA introduce proper material induce dentinal bridge formation , great mean thickness dentinal bridge le inflammation compare traditional material like calcium hydroxide . Although biocompatible , MTA poor handle characteristic , delay set time , off-white color , almost expensive.The Novel Endodontic Cement ( NEC ) introduce combine reasonable characteristic MTA appropriate chemical property , set time , color , handle characteristic . The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) pulp comprise variety protein polysaccharide , form neat network . The ECM component induce either reactionary reparative dentin formation . Fibronectin ( FN ) tenascin ( TNC ) two major glycoprotein involve wound heal odontogenesis . Fibronectins ( FNs ) class high molecular weight adhesive protein compose two large subunit . It variety cell function , adhesion , migration , growth , differentiation . Furthermore FN may involve polarization migration odontoblasts . Tenascin large oligomeric glycoprotein ECM secrete fibroblast glial cell tissue culture . It also identify pulp prominent dentinogenesis . TN show important differentiation odontoblasts . Therefore , may associate secondary dentin formation , pulp cell differentiate odontoblasts response physiologic stimulus . Although dentin bridge formation report , use different material MTA NEC direct pulp cap , exact mechanism well understood . Immunohistochemistry , use different marker , may useful develop molecule involve process . Moreover , response dental pulp different pulp cap material study , include mean thickness dentinal bridge , morphology dentinal bridge , intensity pulp inflammation presence odontoblast cell .</detailed_description>
