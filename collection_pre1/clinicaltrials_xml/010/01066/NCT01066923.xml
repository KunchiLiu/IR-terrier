	<brief_title>Enhanced Firefighter Rehab Trial : The Role Aspirin Preventing Heat Stress Induced Platelet Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Firefighters high rate line-of duty death ( LODD ) United States . More half LODD cardiovascular relate occur disproportionately around fire suppression activity . In addition , shift work , lifestyle factor , exposure associate fire suppression ( e.g . smoke , chemical ) may predispose firefighter earlier onset heart disease cause pro-inflammatory state lead endothelial dysfunction . Fire suppression activity exacerbate cardiovascular strain endothelial dysfunction provide potential trigger ischemic event ( e.g . myocardial infarction , stroke ) . There rapid rise heart rate follow activation fire company may persist long 20 minute . Even case heavy work perform , repetitive upper body exercise associate tool use raise heart rate disproportionately oxygen consumption . Finally , rapid rise core body temperature increase physical activity , environmental heat impaired thermoregulation show cause vasoconstriction activate coagulation heat stress ( 12 , 13 ) . This recently demonstrate firefighter work thermal protective clothing . The combination trigger create fire suppression may result heart attack stroke , especially firefighter risk factor cardiovascular disease . Interventions beyond basic fireground rehab may require minimize effect trigger enhance firefighter 's health wellness . Fireground rehab typically focus cool rehydration firefighter follow fire suppression train assumption intervention correct underlie pathophysiology . Effective fireground rehab must deliver appropriate intervention monitor progress firefighter . While correct hyperthermia hypohydration essential continue performance , clear therapy correct alteration platelet endothelial function intervention necessary correct physiological disturbance . Furthermore , option monitor firefighter beyond simply measure heart respiratory rate limit . In FEMA-funded Fireground Rehab Evaluation ( FIRE ) Trial , demonstrate five commercially available thermometer reliably measure estimate core temperature follow uncompensable heat stress ( UHS ) make impossible gauge effectiveness rehab intervention .</detailed_description>
