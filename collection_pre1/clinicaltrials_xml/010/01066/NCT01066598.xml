	<brief_title>A Study Rituximab Combined With Prednisone Initial Treatment Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease ( cGVHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Host antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) important role pathogenesis chronic graft-versus-host disease ( C-GVHD ) . B cell antigen-presenting cell may also important activate T cell vivo . In murine leukemia model , B cell show important APCs T cell response . Rates C-GVHD show low B cell deficient murine model compare mice receive rabbit immunoglobulin , rate C-GVHD even low graft deplete B cell . It would appear B cell important role APCs pathogenesis C-GVHD . The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab demonstrate activity steroid-refractory graft versus host disease small retrospective study . Previous evidence indolent lymphoma demonstrate Rituximab potent B-cell depleting agent . These observation suggest B-cell depletion graft versus host disease may effective therapy . Rituximab currently evaluate two separate phase II study currently enrol patient allogeneic stem cell transplant ( allo-SCT ) develop GVHD . The Dana Farber BMT program recently publish phase II study examine safety effectiveness rituximab monotherapy set steroid-refractory GVHD . Rituximab administer weekly standard dose 375 mg/m2 . The clinical response rate 70 % response limited patient cutaneous musculoskeletal manifestation C-GVHD . Median corticosteroid dose improved 40 mg/day 10 mg/day . The BMT program Stanford enrol patient phase II study examine impact 4 weekly dos 375 mg/m2 Rituximab give start day +56 follow allo-SCT patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) attempt prevent development subsequent GVHD . These two study provide important phase II data regard safety efficacy Rituximab prevention GVHD treatment steroid-refractory GVHD . Another area interest would initial treatment GVHD . Although universally recognize standard care , corticosteroid form backbone treatment GVHD either give single agent part combination therapy strategy Cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , Tacrolimus ( FK506 ) mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) . We propose phase II study rituximab combination prednisone primary therapy C-GVHD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Previously untreated symptomatic classical CGVHD ( prior allogeneic stem cell transplant ) require systemic therapy ( define per NIH Consensus : ) At least 3 site organ involvement individual organ score least 2 , b ) Patients agent GVHD prophylaxis ( therapeutic dose taper cyclosporine A tacrolimus ) patient receive therapy acute GVHD prior enrollment eligible Patients must 18 year age old Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event response assessment followup . Patient must willing able complete GVHD questionnaire For patient start prednisone therapy cGVHD otherwise meet eligibility criterion , registration trial must occur later 14 day start prednisone therapy . Exclusion Criteria Uncontrolled infection time study enrollment Recurrent malignancy time study enrollment Previous systemic therapy CGVHD , ) Patients agent GVHD prophylaxis ( therapeutic dose taper cyclosporine A tacrolimus ) patient receive therapy acute GVHD prior enrollment eligible . b ) Patients restart full dos agent use GVHD prophylaxis ( ie . cyclosporine A tacrolimus ) taper discontinue eligible Inability tolerate prednisone ( include preexist myopathy , diabetes poor glycemic control , uncontrolled hypertension fluid retention ) rituximab Usage additional concurrent agent could treat CGVHD ( ie . chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide , methotrexate immunosuppressive agent ) . Patients may continue stable taper dose GVHD prophylaxis agent cyclosporine tacrolimus , must taper first study treatment The administration anticancer therapy investigational agent permit . Use hematopoietic colony stimulate factor manage blood count allow . Sexually active male female childbearing potential unwilling practice contraception study . Patients childbearing potential must willing use reliable method birth control ( i.e . double barrier method ) . Women childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test baseline lactating . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month surgically sterile consider nonchildbearing potential . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection . Therefore , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction . Patients active hepatitis B exclude</criteria>
