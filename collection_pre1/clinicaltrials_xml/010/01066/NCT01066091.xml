	<detailed_description>32 healthy volunteer separate four group : 8 young lean men , 8 young obese men , 8 age lean men 8 age obese men . They come center four time inclusion , 2 4 week wash time . At first visit undergo different test evaluate body composition , glucose tolerance , rest energy expenditure , muscular strength . At three visit , people undergo kinetic blood sampling , urine biopsy adipose tissue period 8h ingestion test meal . The different meal test ( Oleic acid vs palmitic acid v lipid ) give random way three visit . Before three visit , control diet establish . At last visit body composition muscular strength evaluate .</detailed_description>
