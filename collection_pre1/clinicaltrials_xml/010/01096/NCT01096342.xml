	<brief_title>Dinaciclib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ( overall response rate ) single agent SCH 727965 patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity associate use single agent SCH 727965 patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma . II . To evaluate response duration progression free survival among patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma undergo treatment single agent SCH 727965 . III . To study effect SCH 727965 myeloma cell proliferation , apoptotic rate assess ability drug inhibit drug target ( cyclin dependent kinase , cdk myeloma cell . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive dinaciclib IV 2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood bone marrow sample collect periodically correlative study . ( US site ) After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
