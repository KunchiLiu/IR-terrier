	<brief_title>A Dose-Defining Study CXL-1020 Patients With Systolic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each 3 stratum describe : Invasive Strata 1 : This randomize , double-blinded stratum enroll 65 patient hospitalize symptomatic heart failure indwell PA catheter allow invasive hemodynamic evaluation . Each patient receive six hour intravenous infusion either placebo CXL-1020 . Non-Invasive Strata 2 : This randomize , double-blinded stratum enroll approximately 72 patient ( several cohort 12-24 patient ) neither require , place , indwell PA catheter hemodynamic monitoring , meet study entrance criterion symptom heart failure , ( dyspnea rest ) systolic dysfunction specific echocardiography criterion . Monitoring drug effect perform Echocardiography . Invasive-Strata 3 : This randomize , double-blinded stratum begin evaluation substantial number patient Strata A B enroll approximately 15-30 patient use general enrollment criterion Invasive Strata A .</detailed_description>
