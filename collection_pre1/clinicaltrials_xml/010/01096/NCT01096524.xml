	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis severe debilitate condition greatly impact patient quality life , function , emotional well-being everyday pain level . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) perform mean alleviate symptom long term however short term muscle weakness follow surgery elicit detrimental effect performance activity daily live . This underlines importance mitigate strength loss immediate post-operative period . Recent review suggest Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) quadriceps femoris muscle beneficial rehabilitation period follow knee surgery . It appear early use NMES help recover exercise capacity muscle , thus allow patient benefit volitional exercise therapy later rehabilitation period1 . This turn lead accelerate recovery improve outcomes . A recent yet unpublished study 96 patient follow ACL reconstruction demonstrate clear benefit use Kneehab . The benefit seem accrue six-week post-operative period . A recent pilot study Walls 2 also suggest NMES applied immediate pre-operative period TKA lead increase muscle strength improve functional ability . Previously , Mizner ( 2005 ) show pre operative strength good predictor functional outcome 1 year surgery3 . This propose study aim examine whether NMES apply peri-operative timeframe , 6 week 6 week , improve outcome patient undergo total knee replacement . The rationale approach NMES help prepare quadriceps muscle rehabilitation phase building exercise capacity operation . The immediate deficit , normally follow knee surgery , would therefore compensated extent post-operative NMES treatment would expect counteract activation inhibition think occur early week follow surgery . Overall , patient would better position benefit conventional rehabilitation exercise aim improved co-ordination functional performance .</detailed_description>
