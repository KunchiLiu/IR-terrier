	<brief_title>Correlation Between Pain Emergence Delirium After Adenotonsillectomy Preschool Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy common surgery perform paediatric population . Sevoflurane frequently volatile anaesthetic use paediatric population . It well tolerate , allow rapid anaesthesia induction , fast emergence , orientation . A child emerge sevoflurane anaesthesia may experience variety behavioural disturbance describe `` emergence delirium '' ( ED ) . ED describe `` mental disturbance recovery general anaesthesia consist hallucination , delusion confusion manifest moaning , restlessness , involuntary physical activity , thrash bed '' immediate post anaesthesia period . Additionally paranoid ideation observe combination emergence behaviour . Restless recovery anaesthesia important problem . It may lead , along injury child , bleed surgical site , accidental removal IV catheter drain . Once ED occur , extra nursing care may necessary , well supplemental sedative and/or analgesic medication , may associate respiratory depression airway obstruction may delay patient discharge . Although long-term psychological implication ED remain unknown , child restless recovery anaesthesia seven time likely new-onset separation anxiety , apathy , eat sleep problem . ED sevoflurane anaesthesia suggest associated postoperative pain behaviour . Accordingly , adequate pain relief find reduce effect ED sevoflurane anaesthesia . Because self-evaluation difficult In preschool boy observational scale base behaviour like CHIPPS , FLACC CHEOPS use measurement pain . Given child 's behaviour evaluation emergence make observational scale , superimposition ED pain measurement possible . Nurses doctor use behavioural scale evaluation ED pain may able differentiate pain ED awakening . This may lead treatment autolimitated disturb ( ED ) treatment pain surgery .</detailed_description>
