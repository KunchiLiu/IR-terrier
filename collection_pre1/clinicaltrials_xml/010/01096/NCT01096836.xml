	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect two different diet ( low carbohydrate - LCD conventional - CONV ) body composition , strength performance , muscle mass biomarkers health overweight adult submit resistance training ( RT ) . It hypothesize LCD would produce high rate weight loss diet would useful maintain muscle mass strength biomarkers health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Carbohydrate Conventional Diets Associated Resistance Training Muscle Fitness Health Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity prevalence increase worldwide . Current guideline recommend health behavior modification , include well eat habit regular physical activity ( include resistance training - RT ) strategy control prevent problem . Traditionally , diet poor energy fat ( conventional diet - CONV ) recommend promote loss body fat mass ; however , recently grow interest academic community investigate effect low carbohydrate diet ( LCD ) health outcome , since kind diet appear effective reduce body mass compare CONV . Nevertheless , evidence scarce regard effect LCD associate RT body composition , strength performance , blood lipid , endothelium function marker health , demand development clinical trial aim determine combine health effect intervention .</detailed_description>
