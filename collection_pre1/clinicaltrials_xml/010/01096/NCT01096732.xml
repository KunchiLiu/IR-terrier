	<brief_summary>This clinical trial look effect new drug call GDC-0449 patient cancer pancreas . Laboratory study show drug block process pancreatic cell think involved cancer development spread . This process call 'Hedgehog signal pathway ' . As yet , unclear whether block hedgehog signal directly affect tumour cell surround normal tissue . Understanding distinction help improve treatment strategy pancreatic cancer . Patients offer participate research study localise pancreatic cancer remove surgery . In period diagnosis surgery investigator normally treat patient , however trial investigator ask patient take GDC-0449 approximately two week day surgery . All patient enter study undergone diagnostic biopsy pancreatic tumour investigator collect second sample tumour surgery . The main question study whether investigator detect change hedgehog signal normal tumour surround tissue . Furthermore investigator look carefully whether treatment safe patient . All problem surgery carefully document investigator define strict rule stop study investigator observe serious problem .</brief_summary>

Males donate sperm treatment 3 month last dose . Women childbearing potential require negative serum pregnancy test ( sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL ) within 10−14 day within 24 hour prior first dose GDC0449 . Known Hepatitis B/C Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection Known hypersensitivity GDC0449 Active cardiac ischemic disease ( criterion apply participation image part study ) Women , pregnant plan become pregnant lactating ( study 12 month last dose ) . Concurrent participation another clinical trial use investigational medicinal product . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , judgment investigator would make undesirable patient enter trial ( i.e . patient able swallow tablet ) .</criteria>
