	<brief_summary>Acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) arise leukemia stem cell difficult eradicate serve reservoir disease relapse follow chemotherapy . A promising area investigation development immunotherapeutic approach stimulate immune system recognize leukemia stem cell foreign eliminate . The purpose research study determine safety Dendritic Cell AML Fusion Vaccine ( DC AML vaccine ) participant achieve remission chemotherapy . In clinical trial , patient treat tumor vaccine alone follow standard care chemotherapy . The DC AML vaccine investigational agent try help immune system recognize fight cancer cell . It hop DC AML vaccine prevent delay disease come back .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- On study participant receive DC AML vaccine GM-CSF 4-8 week completion chemotherapy acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . GM-CSF drug stimulate white blood cell give DC AML Vaccine effort enhance effect vaccine . Participants receive 2-3 dos vaccine 4 week interval . - All participant undergo follow procedure : Isolation tumor cell either bone marrow biopsy blood draw ; Initial chemotherapy AML standard therapy ; Leukopheresis ( collection white blood cell blood ) . - All participant also blood test , physical exam , electrocardiogram prior dose vaccine . - Four week follow final vaccination , participant undergo skin test call `` delayed-type hypersensitivity '' ( DTH ) . This injection tumor cell skin measure immune system respond . The tumor cell break irradiated prevent growth .</detailed_description>
