	<detailed_description>Rituximab , anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , new alternative treatment patient severe immune disease resistance conventional treatment . One mechanisms action drug complement-mediated lysis . Most RA patient respond well rituximab treatment , however , refractory mechanism non-response still unclear . The role CD55 CD59 protein overexpression mechanism resistance rituximab treatment lymphoma patient investigate . However , studied correlation intensity expression regulatory molecule B cell RA patient resistance treatment Rituximab .</detailed_description>
