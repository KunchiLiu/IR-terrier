	<brief_title>Non Operative Treatment Acute Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute appendicitis one common urgent condition see general surgery practice . Complications severe include perforation generalize peritonitis . Traditionally , surgical appendectomy primary treatment , even case unconfirmed diagnosis , give low incidence major complication . In 15-30 % case , fact , appendix find free disease upon resection . This procedure , however , without risk . It associate surgical wound infection , intestinal obstruction due adhesion , pneumonia , tubal infertility female . For reason , possibility use conservative treatment merit investigation . There considerable debate regard utility conservative treatment surgical treatment case acute appendicitis , study address issue date . If deem useful , become utmost importance make accurate diagnosis assessment every patient order select appropriate treatment . Hansson et al conduct randomized clinical trial investigate efficacy conservative treatment compare surgery acute appendicitis . They report conservative treatment antibiotic efficacious 91 % case , 14 % relapse rate 12 month follow-up . One third relapse occur within first 10 day hospital discharge , remain two third occur 3 16 month follow discharge . The rate minor complication diarrhea , vomit , nosocomial infection similar among patient treat conservatively treat surgically . The incidence major complication appendiceal abscess , paralytic ileus pulmonary embolism , however , significantly high treat surgically ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . A recent prospective randomize study conduct Ajaz colleague compare antibiotic therapy appendectomy acute appendicitis . The author report conservative treatment safe efficacious , cause patient less pain surgery , reduce need analgesic therapy ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Ten percent conservatively treat patient relapse within 12 month discharge . A multicenter randomize trial conduct Sweden yield similar result : rate relapse antibiotic treat patient 14 % one year discharge . Interestingly , equal rate post-operative complication patient treat surgically . Based report , conservative treatment seem represent valid therapeutic approach acute appendicitis . Relapse rate low comparable rate surgical complication . Rationale : Case control study randomly assign patient either surgical non-surgical treatment yield relapse rate approximately 14 % one year . It would useful know relapse rate patient , instead , select give treatment base thorough clinical evaluation , include physical examination laboratory result ( characteristic form Alvarado Score ) well radiological exam need deem helpful . If clinical evaluation useful , investigator would expect patient selection well chance , relapse rate lower 14 % . Once investigator establish utility evaluation , investigator begin identify component predictive value ( blood chemistry analysis , CT finding ) . This first step toward develop accurate diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm avoid risk cost needless surgery . Study Description : This single-cohort prospective interventional study . It interfere usual procedure , consist clinical examination Emergency Department ( ED ) execution follow exams physician 's discretion : complete blood count differential , C reactive protein , abdominal ultrasound , abdominal CT . Patients admit Emergency Department Lower Abdominal suspicion Acute Appendicitis need immediate surgery , request informed consent undergo observation non operative treatment antibiotic therapy ( Amoxicillin Clavulanic Acid ) . The patient protocol receive previous antibiotic treatment clinical episode . Patients undergo surgery physically examine 5 day later . During follow-up visit , patient give information study , invite participate , ask sign inform consent form . If patient age 18 year , consent obtain parent legal guardian . Telephone ( email ) follow-up conduct 15 day , 6 month , 12 month ( see attach schedule ) monitor state illness . The patient ask he/she undergone surgery since first visit ( 5 day post-ED ) . If , patient ask : 1. illness improve , stay , worsen since onset ? 2. do test additional doctor 's visit illness ? 3. initial emergency department visit , much time take return normal activity ( physical activity , work , etc ) ? In case patient age 18 year , phone interview conduct parent legal guardian . Study Objectives : Main Objective : Evaluate outcome patient treat conservatively , assess reliability initial clinical evaluation predict conservatively-treated patient treat surgically . Primary Outcomes follow : 1 . Short Term Efficacy Antibiotic Treatment : Failure conservative treatment antibiotic within period Amoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid therapy ( 7 day ) , define readmission abscence clinical improvement and/or worsen abdominal pain and/or localized/diffuse peritonitis 2 . Long Term Efficacy Antibiotic Treatment : Efficacy antibiotic therapy acute appendicitis define incidence recurrence clinical episode appendicitis 1 year follow 3 . Long Term Efficacy Antibiotic Treatment ( NO need surgery ) : Efficacy antibiotic therapy acute appendicitis define definite improvement without need surgery within 1 year follow 4 . Safety Antibiotic treatment : Major side effects/complications drug/treatment-related ( i.e . Allergy complication treatment related abscess formation ) Secondary Outcomes : 1 . Minor Complications : Minor side effects/complications drug/treatment-related ( i.e . bloating , diarrhea , gas , headache , heartburn , nausea , vomit ) 2 . Abdominal Pain discharge : Assessment abdominal pain / discomfort evaluate mean Numerical rating scale ( NRS ) 3 . Length Hospital stay : Length clinical observation inpatient 4 . Outpatient clinic checkup : Number follow appointment schedule outpatient clinic 5 . Sick Leave : Number day sick leave need patient 6 . Cost analysis : Analysis cost , include Antibiotic course , Length Hospital Stay , Outpatient Clinic follow appointment , sick leave day Additional Objective : Identify clinical , laboratory image finding predictive relapse need appendectomy . Study Design : Single cohort prospective interventional study . No experimental intervention treatment employ beyond routine clinical care . Inclusion Criteria : Any patient , male female , age 14 year ( non-pediatric ) , return follow-up visit 5 day ED visit consent participation January 1 , 2010 December 31 , 2010 . The investigator estimate sample size 160 , number patient suspect acute appendicitis typically receive yearly ED . Means follow-up assessment : telephone interview ( e-mail )</detailed_description>
