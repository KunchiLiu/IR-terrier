	<brief_summary>Postcancer fatigue severe invalidating problem , impair quality life . About 20 40 % patient remain fatigued , least one year successful cancer treatment . Fortunately , effective treatment postcancer fatigue ; cognitive behavior therapy . However , cause postcancer fatigue identify yet . The aim study identify factor ( partly ) cause postcancer fatigue improve theoretical understanding fatigue improve diagnostics fatigue , predict therapy outcome , facilitate treatment option . In study , disease-free fatigued cancer patient , finish treatment cancer least one year maximally ten year ago , approach study . They compare non-fatigued patient . First , baseline assessment take place . Magnetic resonance imaging brain perform assess brain volume magnetic resonance spectroscopy perform measure concentration specific substance brain . Changes volume part brain observe ( non-cancer ) patient chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , comparison healthy control . In addition , abnormal concentration specific substance observe patient CFS compare healthy control . To assess muscle fatigue , two-minute endurance test upper arm administer maximal voluntary contraction . Next difference brain , CFS patient show ( central ) muscle fatigue . A maximal exercise test bicycle perform assess physical fitness . Physical activity fatigue cancer survivor decrease , compare healthy control . It know whether physical deconditioning originate cancer treatment reason patient still less active . In addition , patient control wear actometer two week register baseline daily physical activity additional 5 day maximal exercise test , assess effect exercise daily physical activity . Finally , patient control complete standardize questionnaire perform neurological/psychological test , like reaction time test short time memory task , baseline . The result non-fatigued fatigued patient compare baseline . For non-fatigued participant , study finish baseline measurement . The fatigued participant start cognitive behavior therapy immediately baseline measurement 6 month , depend randomization . At end therapy , six month , 6 month wait cognitive behavior therapy , second assessment take place , comparable baseline measurement . These result compare baseline situation analyze effect cognitive behavior therapy ( possible ) cause postcancer fatigue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Explorative Study Physiological Neurophysiological Determinants Fatigue Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatigue curative treatment cancer severe invalidate problem . 20-40 % disease-free cancer patient mention fatigue frequent complaint , impair quality life . In search ( neuro ) physiological factor determine fatigue , centre recently demonstrate presence morphological difference brain non-cancer patient chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) compare healthy volunteer . Both patient CFS fatigue patient neuromuscular disease show fatigue central neurophysiological component ( so-called central activation failure ) . Others show chronic fatigue associate alter brain metabolism . Studies proton MR spectroscopy ( 1H MRS ) demonstrate high choline creatine ratio brain chronically fatigue patient . This suggest increase cell membrane turnover . Also reduced level N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio ( NAA/Cr ) right hippocampus observe patient , suggest decrease functional axon . Finally , elevate ventricular lactate observe , suggest change brain glucose metabolism . Actigraphy show actual physical activity fatigue cancer survivor decrease compare healthy control . It know whether physical deconditioning originate actual cancer treatment reason patient still less active . Until ( neuro ) physiological factor identify explain fatigue cancer survivor . Recently show Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) especially design fatigued cancer patient effective treatment . Aim : To identify measure ( neuro ) physiological factor fatigue fatigue cancer survivor determine role factor maintain fatigue . The identification ( neuro ) physiological factor persistent fatigue help improve diagnostics fatigue , predict therapy outcome facilitate treatment option . Finally , ( neuro ) physiological characteristic fatigue influence CBT enhance understand mechanism cause fatigue . Research question : 1 ) What characteristic ( neuro ) physiological factor fatigue disease-free cancer patient ? 2 ) To degree factor influence Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ? Design : In explorative study fatigue disease-free cancer patient ( n=57 ) , finish treatment cancer least one year maximally ten year ago , approach study ask informed consent . They compare age sex match non-fatigued patient ( n=21 ) . First , base-line assessment take place , include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) ass brain morphology brain metabolite , respectively . To assess peripheral central fatigue two-minute endurance test administer maximal voluntary ( isometric ) contraction ( MVC ) . During test change EMG force indicate peripheral fatigue , central fatigue study twitch interpolation technique . A maximal exercise test perform assess physical fitness deconditioning . At baseline patient also give actometer register daily activity two week . Further , actometer register daily activity five day maximal exercise test . Finally , baseline patient fill standardize questionnaire , include Checklist Individual Strength self-observation list ass fatigue severity . Then , fatigue patient start immediately Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) . At end therapy , 6 month , second assessment take place group patient . The assessment consist measurement baseline . The result compare baseline situation analyze effect CBT ( neuro ) physiological parameter . Relevance study : Fatigue long treatment cancer frequently occur problem , important consequence quality life patient . Identification characteristic ( neuro ) physiological factor fatigue disease-free cancer patient may serve theoretical understand invalidate condition , may also provide objective biological marker could support diagnosis follow-up treatment . The identification ( neuro ) physiological factor play role fatigue cancer may aid early recognition patient risk develop fatigue may lead early intervention and/or different treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
