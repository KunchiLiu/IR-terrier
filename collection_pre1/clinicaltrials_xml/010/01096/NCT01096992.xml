	<brief_summary>The goal Phase 1 clinical research study find high tolerable dose bendamustine , combine fludarabine rituximab , give patient CLL treat . The goal Phase 2 study find drug combination help control disease . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine , Bendamustine , Rituximab ( FBR ) Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Fludarabine bendamustine design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Rituximab design attach cancer cell damage , may cause cancer cell die . It also design cause immune system attack cancer cell . Study Drug Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . One ( 1 ) 8 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase 1 portion study , 58 participant enrol Phase 2 . If enrolled Phase 1 , dose bendamustine receive depend join study . The first group receive low dose . The next group receive high dose , number type side effect low none . The dose bendamustine increase new group high tolerable dose find . If enrolled Phase 2 , receive bendamustine high dose tolerate Phase 1 . All participant phase study start dose level fludarabine rituximab . If side effect occur , study doctor may decide low dos study therapy . If side effect dose , study staff observe problem 2 hour dose . Study Drug Administration : Cycles study 4 week . All 3 study drug give vein . Cycle 1 : - On Days 1-3 , bendamustine give 30 minute . - On Days 2-4 , fludarabine give 30 minute . - On Day 4 , rituximab give 6-8 hour . Cycles 2-6 : - On Day 1 , rituximab give high dose Cycle 1 . If tolerated Cycle 1 dose well , Cycles 2-6 rituximab dos may give 2-4 hour . - On Days 1-3 , fludarabine give 30 minute . - On Days 1-3 , bendamustine give 30 minute . Other Drugs : You give Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) Benadryl ( diphenhydramine hydrochloride ) take mouth 30-60 minute every dose rituximab ( Cycles 1-6 ) . These drug give low risk side effect . Study Visits : Once week Cycle 1 every 2-4 week Cycles 2-6 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Before Cycles 1-6 , also physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You ask side effect may . Before Cycle 4 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease . - If doctor think need , CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Length Study Participation : You may receive 6 cycle study treatment . The study treatment stop early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Treatment Visit : After Cycle 6 ( early stop early ) , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease . - If doctor think disease completely respond , CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis confirm response . Follow-Up Visits : You follow-up visit end Month 6 Year 1 last dose study drug , year start new cancer treatment . The test perform end-of-treatment visit . Starting Year 3 , follow-up test procedures do local doctor convenient . You tell study doctor staff start another cancer treatment study . If occurs , follow-up study stop . This investigational study . Both fludarabine bendamustine commercially available FDA approve treat CLL . Rituximab commercially available FDA approve treat lymphoma . The use drug together study investigational . Up 82 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
