	<brief_summary>Spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) use 40 year treat neuropathic pain . Various clinical study show beneficial effect SCS pain patient Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) . Since 2 year 8-contact point Octad lead use replace 4-contact point Quad lead . Even though seem eight electrode potential advantage four electrode case lead migration disease progress , clinical data publish effectiveness SCS use octopolar epidural lead . The Octad study intent assess effectiveness technical performance SCS Octad® lead treatment chronic pain . This study set comparison study Octad lead SCS lead , Quad lead , Octad lead use eligible FBSS patient standard care lead . The study intend : 1. evaluate effectiveness SCS Octad® lead chronic pain Failed Back Surgery Syndrome patient 12 month treatment . 2. collect safety data SCS Octad® lead patient refractory chronic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Octapolar Lead Patients With Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) pain control already history 40 year . In SCS , lead position epidural space dorsal aspect spinal cord produce stimulation induce paraesthesia painful area . During last decade many article publish , clearly indicate effectiveness safety SCS quadripolar lead pain management chronic neuropathic pain , particular Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) . Randomized controlled trial demonstrate compare re-operation , SCS provide effective pain relief least 3 year compare conventional non-surgical neuropathic pain management least 2 year . However , SCS-related complication occur , divide surgical complication hardware complication . The hardware technology substantially improve year . Moreover , electrodes become small shape easy navigate epidural space ; finally , internal pulse generator new program capability longer battery life span . All technological development lead application minimally invasive percutaneous stimulation trial variety patient chronic neuropathic pain . Turner et al perform meta-analysis spinal cord stimulation fail back surgery syndrome publication report hardware complication 24 % lead migration , 7 % lead failure 2 % pulse generator failure . While analysis evaluate study use old hardware system , first evidence rate complication lower currently new system . In recently publish PROCESS paper , also use quadripolar electrode , long term follow-up show hardware complication 14 % : lead migration , 3 % lead failure pulse generator failure . Generally , patient radicular pain low extremity respond good spinal cord stimulation patient isolated axial low back pain . However , study show axial low back pain combination bilateral leg pain , also respond well spinal cord stimulation . Both four ( e.g . quadripolar Quad lead ) eight ( e.g . octapolar Octad® lead ) electrodes show effective treatment low back low extremity pain , apparent advantage one system . In recent PROCESS study publication , reduction SCS low-back pain not-statistically significant compare baseline . Even though seem eight electrode may potential advantage case lead migration disease progress , clinical data publish effectiveness SCS use octopolar epidural lead . The Octad study prospective , multi-center , open-label , non-randomized , interventional study design assess effectiveness technical performance SCS Octad® lead treatment chronic pain . This study set comparison study Octad lead SCS lead , Quad lead , Octad lead use eligible FBSS patient standard care lead .</detailed_description>
