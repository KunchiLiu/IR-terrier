	<brief_summary>The primary aim test magnitude duration analgesia provide single dose multi-drug analgesia administer perianal block , compare standard solution ( Marcaine &amp; Lidocaine 1:1 mixture - Total 60 ml ) , post-operative period also compare standard solution include respective post-operative opioid non-opioid oral analgesic requirement . Local anesthesia via perianal block use multi-drug analgesia standard solution compare use Numeric pain rating scale Post-operative day 1 , 3 follow visit day 7 . The investigator hope find good control post-operative analgesia lead well functional outcome . Possible decrease consumption opioids post-operative period perhaps decrease cost chance addiction increase patient comfort compliance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-operative analgesia anorectal surgery still pose significant problem . Technical operator dependent factor propose cause severe pain post operatively . Many factor height anastomosis , incorporation smooth muscle , size doughnut , inclusion squamous epithelium consider cause pain specially hemorrhoidectomy . However , spite standardize technique , patient still experience moderate severe pain anorectal surgery . Effective post-surgical pain control critical patient recovery , contribute improve healing , faster patient mobilization , reduce hospital stay health care cost . Effective multimodal technique devise maximize pain relief , low risk adverse event , improve patient outcome . These technique ( wound infiltration local anesthetic common ) short live , maximum 12 hour . Post-operative pain usually last 72 hour thus systemic opioids remain mainstay pain control post-operatively . Although effective analgesic , associate unwanted potentially adverse event , nausea , vomit , pruritus , sedation , cognitive impairment , urinary retention , sleep disturbance , respiratory depression . Also , narcotic addiction remain concern surgical patient . Some patient would like effective analgesia thus also avoid narcotics.Multi-drug analgesic combination use orthopedic surgery ( Ropivacaine , Ketorolac , Morphine , adrenaline ) hemorrhoidectomy ( extended-release liposome Bupivacaine ) show decrease post-operative analgesia requirement . However , study use multi-drug analgesia show effect pain medication consumption discharge ambulatory surgery . The investigator design novel multi-drug anesthetic formulation achieve long-acting postoperative analgesia single-dose administration intra-operative via perianal block wound infiltration .</detailed_description>
