	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Intervening rural primary care population clinically validate telehealth tool ( Epharmix Diabetes ) algorithmically triages patient facilitate patient-provider communication result statistically significant improvement indicator diabetes control . Study Design - Study Type : Experimental , non-controlled crossover study ( intervention vs. standard care clinic ) - Primary aim : decrease average self-tested pre-prandial blood glucose level HgbA1C - Secondary aim : decreased number disease-related emergency room ( ER ) visit , decrease number self-reported blood glucose measurement outside goal - Duration : 3 month + 1 month enrollment period - Safety : Protocol direction University Missouri Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . All patient refer emergency department unsafe blood glucose level report . All information encrypt HIPAA compliant . - Sample Size : Clinic flow analysis estimate 61 patient eligible study ( 5 provider , assume 30 % eligible patient meet inclusion criterion 4-week enrollment period interested ) , 50 patient likely stay study ( 80 % retention rate ) . - Power analysis : Based pilot data assume alpha error = 0.05 , study great 80 % statistical power detect difference population use 20 patient minimum detectable effect size ( decrease HgbA1C ) 0.7 % Methodology - The investigator supply family practice clinic Mercy one-page summary advertisement intervention . At point clinical encounter patient exist new diagnosis diabetes , provider invite patient participate Community Integration Project . Providers maintain list patient interested study correspond phone number investigator regularly add patient study . - Over 3-month study period , patient interact telehealth system twice day , enter blood glucose level prompt . As recommended physician Mercy , investigator message physician week digest patient risk exist electronic medical record ( EMR ) inbox easily integrate exist clinic flow . - HgbA1c measure prior start intervention measure within 7 day complete intervention . - Providers notified system patient triaged `` high risk , '' , pre-selected range self-reported blood glucose level . Providers automatically connect patient titrate blood glucose control . - At conclusion study , new average self-reported blood glucose response compare average prior intervention clinic average patient diabetes . Additionally , HgbA1C level compare pre post -intervention . - Results analyzed conclusion present participate stakeholder poster session .</detailed_description>
