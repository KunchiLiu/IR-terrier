	<brief_summary>Objective . To evaluate impact HPV vaccination part hrHPV-based primary screen program extend screen interval . Materials method . A total 18,000 woman age 25-45 year , attend regular cervical cancer-screening program primary health care service Tlalpan , Mexico City , invite study . Eligible participant assign one three comparison group : 1 ) HPV16/18 vaccine hrHPV-based screening ; 2 ) HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine hrHPV-based screening ; 3 ) Control group receive hrHPV-based screening . Strict surveillance hrHPV persistent infection occurrence precancerous lesion conduct estimate safety profile different screen interval ; participant undergo diagnosis confirmation treatment necessary . Discussion : The FASTER-Tlalpan Study provide insight new approach cervical cancer prevention program . It offer valuable information potential benefit combine HPV vaccination hrHPV-based screening safety extend screen interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer mortality reflection social inequity health care . Globally , 266,000 woman die cervical cancer annually , 85 % death occur low- middle income country ( LMIC ) .1,2 Persistent infection high-risk human papillomavirus ( hrHPV ) necessary cause cervical cancer.3,4 HPV16 HPV18 responsible 70 % squamous cell carcinoma , conjunction HPV45 , cause 94.2 % cervical adenocarcinomas.4 The introduction HPV vaccine change epidemiology HPV-related cancer . However , may take 30 year observe desire benefit widespread vaccination vaccinate cohort reach peak age cervical cancer case currently occur ( e.g . woman age 40-50 year ) .5 As August 2015 , 84 country territory national public-sector HPV immunization program 38 pilot programs.6 These program mainly target adolescent girl obtain great cost-benefit ratio,7 consider initial price vaccine ( &gt; $ 100 US per dose ) .8,9 Women old age 25 also vulnerable new HPV infections10 could also vaccinate depend country-specific resource availability . Recent result Phase III HPV vaccination trial document vaccine 's efficacy among adult woman excellent ( efficacy &gt; 80 % prevent resultant HPV-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ) .11,12 Additionally , current vaccine protect HPV16 HPV18 well provide cross-protection HPV type , particularly type 31 45.13 Broad-spectrum protection may lower need subsequent screening , warrant longer screening interval currently use , offer novel prevention policy HPV-related cancer . The combination vaccination screen strategy prevent cervical cancer may particularly appropriate country high incidence cervical cancer already implement hrHPV-based screening program . These criterion satisfy Mexico.14 A broad age range females population-based HPV vaccination program could direct benefit vaccinate female , indirect benefit non-vaccinated female male sexual partner via increase herd immunity reduce HPV-related cancers.15 Based high efficacy HPV vaccine old woman , novel strategy combine vaccination screening , HPV FASTER , proposed.16 In accordance proposal , HPV vaccination woman broad age range offer protection woman currently infect , also protect subsequent re-infection.16 As result , combine strategy HPV vaccination screening may reduce lifetime number screen use current hrHPV-based screening program . If screening vaccination strategy widely adopt , expect promise result . This strategy potential : 1 ) mitigate screen demand woman health service extend screening interval ; 2 ) improve cost-benefit balance screening program ; 3 ) provide great protection quality life large number woman reduction cervical cancer.17 An intervention may save many life next 30 year also cost-effective . However , data efficacy HPV vaccination old woman reduce cervical cancer risk , risk precancerous lesion , lack . That , currently insufficient knowledge regard role HPV vaccination old woman permit screen interval extend safely follow negative screen ( Figure 1 ) . A significant challenge HPV-vaccine uptake number dose standard vaccine schedule . Although licensed country use among old individual , national HPV vaccination program target teenager young adult . Recent study find few three dos two commercially available prophylactic HPV vaccine seem provide similar protection cervical HPV16 HPV18 infection three-dose schedule woman young 25 year old . 18,19 Herein propose population-based study assess efficacy 2-dose HPV vaccination [ HPV16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine ( Cervarix ® ) HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine ( Gardasil® ) ] HPV-persistent infection HPV-related cervical disease old woman 25 45 year age attend clinic hrHPV-based screening .</detailed_description>
