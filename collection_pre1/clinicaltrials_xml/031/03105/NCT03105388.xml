	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN : Cross sectional study STUDY HYPOTHESES : There significant correlation STOP-BANG score cephalometric measurement difficult intubation patient risk Obstructive Sleep Apnoea . Null hypothesis : There significant correlation STOP-BANG score cephalometric measurement difficult intubation patient risk Obstructive Sleep Apnoea . SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION This cross sectional study 2 mean . For objective 1 , sample size calculation do use power sample size program version 3.1.2 - Population Standard deviation STOP-BANG score accord Graciela E.Silva et al . ,2011 1.3 , estimate difference population mean 1.28 95 % confidence , Z 1.96 , power study 0.8 - Estimated Sample size require 34 . - With 20 % drop rate , 34+ ( 34x0.2 ) =41 - Sample size require 41 For objective 2 , sample size calculation use PS program version 3.1.2 , Population Standard deviation mandibular-hyoid distance 0.7 accord A.S.Hiremath et al. , 1998 estimate difference population mean 0.68 95 % confidence , Z 1.96 . power study 0.8 - Estimated Sample size require 34 . - With 20 % drop rate , 34+ ( 34x0.2 ) =41 - Sample size require 41 For objective 3 , sample size calculation do use G power 3.1.9.2 program . - Based expert opinion , expect correlation STOP-BANG score cephalometric measurement ( mandibulohyoid distance ) least 0.60 confidence interval 95 % . Power study 0.8 . - The required sample size 30 . - Expected 10 % dropout rate . - 30+ ( 30x 0.1 ) = 33 For objective 4 , sample size calculation use PS size program version 3.1.2 , - Population SD age 12.3 accord Sang Jun Lee et al. , 2011 , estimate difference population mean 12.25 95 % confidence , Z 1.96 . power study 0.8 - Estimated Sample size require 34 . - With 20 % drop rate , 34+ ( 34x0.2 ) =41 - Sample size require 41 - Population SD height 6.9 accord Sang Jun Lee et al. , estimate difference population mean 6.85 95 % confidence , Z 1.96 .power study 0.8 - Estimated Sample size require 34 . - With 20 % drop rate , - Sample size require 41 - Population SD weight 9.7 accord Sang Jun Lee et al , estimate difference population mean 9.65 95 % confidence , Z 1.96 . Power study 0.8 - Estimated Sample size require 34 . - With 20 % drop rate , - Sample size require 41 - Population SD BMI 3.2 accord Sang Jun Lee et al. , estimate difference population mean 3.15 95 % confidence , Z 1.96 .power study 0.8 - Estimated Sample size require 34 . - With 20 % drop rate , - Sample size require 41 - Population Standard deviation neck circumference 3.7 accord Sang Jun Lee et al , estimate difference population mean 3.65 95 % confidence , Z 1.96. power study 0.8 - Estimated Sample size require 34 . - With 20 % drop rate , - Sample size require 41 Thus high number sample size 41 take . SAMPLING METHODS All patient risk OSA come elective surgery fulfil selection criterion include . RECRUITMENT OF SUBJECT AND INFORMED CONSENT SEEKING All patient come elective surgery general anesthesia risk Obstructive Sleep Apnea screen use STOP-BANG questionnaire .Those fulfil selection criterion recruit . Written inform consent obtain one day operation day . Sleep study part objective study . Consent take one day operation day . Patients receive explanation objective study , one lateral head neck x-ray take one day operation , procedure match standard procedure . Normal laryngoscopy do assess airway use Cormack Lehance scoring , intubate use videolaryngoscope . STUDY AREA Operation theater Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia . CONFLICT OF INTEREST This study do benefit patient . There conflict interest . All patient come elective surgery general anesthesia risk Obstructive Sleep Apnea screen use STOP-BANG questionnaire .Those fulfil selection criterion recruit . Written inform consent obtain one day operation day . PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY - Patient 's medical information keep confidential study doctor staff make publicly available unless disclosure require law . - Data obtain study identify patient individually publish knowledge purpose . Patient 's original medical record may review researcher , Ethical Review Board study regulatory authority purpose verify clinical trial procedure and/or data . Patient 's medical information may hold process computer . PROPOSED DATA ANALYSIS Group A intubation easy , limited patient Cormack Lehance grade 1 2 ( glottis immediately visible ) . Group B intubation difficult would comprise patient give Cormack Lehance grade 3 grade 4 ( poor visibility glottis ) . All value show mean +/- SDs percentage . Independent sample t-test , cross-tabulation chi square test use compare two group . P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . A comprehensive evaluation do binary logistic regression analysis multivariate test see effect independent variable dependent variable . STUDY PROTOCOL Human ethical approval obtain HUSM 's ethic committee study . 41 ASA class I II ( normal healthy patient mild systemic disease ) require general anesthesia , age range 18 year old 75 year old recruit . Preoperatively , patient interview research resident complete first study questionnaire regard diagnosis OSA , base self- report patient . For patient previously tested/ diagnosed OSA , STOP-BANG questionnaire use determine STOP-BANG score . In STOP questionnaire 4 used construct STOP score : - Snore consider affirmative participant report snore loudly ( louder talk loud enough heard close door ) . - Tiredness/sleepy day affirmative participant report yes feel unrested day matter many hour sleep he/she ( often almost always = yes ; never , rarely , sometimes = ) report feeling tire ( time , time , good bit time = yes , time , little bit time , none time = ) . - Observed stop breathing define yes participant answer affirmative question `` base participant notice household member tell , time stop breathe sleep ? '' - Blood Pressure define positive participant answer yes treat medication high blood pressure . The BANG portion evaluate assessing : - Body mass index ( BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 ) - Age ( 50 year old ) - Neck circumference ( neck circumference &gt; 40 cm ) - Gender ( male ) . One point assign affirmative answer ; 0 answer . A STOP-BANG score ≥ 3 affirmative chosen study , score high sensitivity negative predictive value moderate/severe OSA , suggest good cutoff value high OSA prevalence among surgical population bariatric patient ( Chung et al 2012 . ) The investigator exclude pregnant patient , fast least 6 hour prior anesthesia , GERD . The patient 's age , gender , ASA status , height , weight , BMI , Thyromental distance , neck circumference record . The patient make sit stick tongue far could , order observe internal structure pharynx light . The finding classify use Mallampati score system . Mallampati et al . classified pharyngeal structure 3 type , Samsoon Young create Modified Mallampati Test divide structure 4 type . - Class 1 soft palate , fauces , uvula anterior posterior tonsillar pillar visible . - Class II class I structure visible except tonsillar pillar . - Class III base uvula visible . - Class IV uvula see soft palate visible . After clinical assessment , Lateral Cephalometry ( lateral head neck x-ray ) take neutral head position radiological department . Mandibular-hyoid distance measure . Patients well fasted overnight operation . No premedication sedative effect give operation day . Standard monitor include : ECG , non-invasive automatic blood pressure monitoring , pulse oximeter . The blood pressure pulse rate take induction anesthesia . Anesthesia perform skilled anesthesiologist investigator study , know cephalometric measurement patient . Pre-oxygenation use 100 % oxygen 5 L/ min 2-3 min give mask inspire voluntary respiration . IV Fentanyl 1.5-2mcg per kg IV Propofol 1-2mg per kg , administrate titration . After loss consciousness , 0.9 mg/kg IV Rocuronium ( muscle relaxant ) give . When state muscle relaxation observe , guide TOF nerve stimulator , head place sniffing position facilitate intubation . Then size 3 curve laryngoscopy use maximize exposure glottis , without press thyroid cartilage , airway evaluate grade follow Cormack Lehance grade system . Cormack Lehane propose grade laryngoscopic view grade I grade . - Grade I epiglottis vocal cord completely expose . - Grade II rear vocal cord see . - Grade III epiglottis expose . - Grade IV soft palate see . Subsequently patient intubate use videolaryngoscope appropriate ETT size . In standard practice , patient intubate use conventional laryngoscopy , study , intubate use videolaryngoscope device assist difficult intubation . After intubation , mechanical ventilation perform oxygen 2L/min , tidal volume 8ml/kg tidal rate 12 bpm . Anesthesia maintain inhalational agent Sevoflurane MAC 1 . After surgery , patient reverse use Suggammadex ( specific antidote Rocuronium ) standard reversal drug mixture ( 1 mg atropine 2.5 mg neogstigmine ) , accord standard practice .</detailed_description>
