	<brief_summary>Primary aldosteronism ( PA ) under-diagnosed cause arterial hypertension . Cardiovascular morbidity mortality hypertension rise significantly patient aldosterone overproduction compare primary hypertension level blod pressure elevation . The classical sign PA severe hypertension hypokalemia may absent , screen define risk group recommend . Screening systematically implement Sweden , probably due expensive , time effort-consuming clinical routine protocol low awareness problem among clinician . The prevalence PA patient hypertension Sweden study adequately , study Northern Europe address problem . The primary objective investigate prevalence PA among patient hypertension primary care implement ass optimal treatment . Discovered case PA go routine clinical work-up order distinguish subtype PA , include computed tomography adrenal adrenal vein sampling ( AVS ) willing fit surgical treatment . Treatment choose depend PA subtype . Those unilateral disease willing fit surgery offer unilateral minimally invasive adrenalectomy . Patients oppose contraindication operative treatment , well patient bilateral disease offer medical treatment mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ( MRA ) . Study participant follow one year surgery initiation specific medical treatment . Please se outcome measure relevant description . Blood sample collect patient confirm PA store biobank potential future genetical biochemical study . A subgroup patient PA undergo adrenal-specific positron-emission tomography assess possibility un-invasively diagnose subtype PA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary care hypertensive patient correspond eligibility criterion contact letter ( include inform consent form ) thus invite take part present study . On one hand , letter send group hypertensive patient could identify hypertension diagnosis base search database belong computerized patient journal system . On hand , letter offer consecutive hypertension patient contact primary care facility whatever reason . The first 1200 patient give informed consent participation go enrol study . The study conduct mostly Karlstad , town central Sweden population 89000 people . Some approximately 4000 hypertensive patient enlist one major primary care facility town , Gripen Outpatient Clinic , contact manner . Gripen serve totally 21000 outpatient . If need enrollment purpose , one region major outpatient clinic involve . Aldosterone - Renin Ratio ( ARR ) , intravenous sodium chloride ( i.v . NaCl ) suppression test adrenal compute tomography ( CT ) de do Karlstad Central Hospital - Surgical , Endocrinological X-ray Departments , respectively . AVS plan carry X-ray laboratory Uppsala University Hospital . Adrenalectomies perform Surgical department Uppsala Karlstad . After two week run-in period liberal salt intake abstinence form licorice chew tobacco , blood sample take study participant . Sampling perform 8-10 a.m. , ideally 2 hrs awaken 5-15 min seat rest . Plasma aldosterone , plasma renin ( Direct Renin Concentration , DRC ) , serum sodium , potassium creatinine go analyse . Aldosterone-Renin Ratio ( ARR ) &gt; = 50 pmol/mU plasma aldosterone &gt; = 170 pmol/l criterion prompt work-up upon suspicion PA . Patients test result consider PA - normokalemic use mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ( MRA ) . Patients use MRA offer optimization retest . MRA discontinue least 6 week substitute need alfa- calcium blocker . Hypokalemic patient test result prompt suspicion PA also optimize potassium supplementation normokalemia sustain retesting . Those suspicion-raising ARR aldosterone go evaluation unrelated potassium level , need correct hypokalemia prior i.v . NaCl suppression test . Patients suspicion PA uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 diastolic pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg ) need efficient treatment proceed confirmation work-up . Patients chronic heart failure NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) stage &gt; 2 go exclude i.v . NaCl suppression test . Possibility PA patient exclude study prior confirmation work-up assess criterion may present time ARR-evaluation . Diagnosis PA state initial hypokalemia , plasma renin detection limit plasma aldosterone 550 pmol/l encounter . Patients suspect PA offer intravenous sodium chloride ( NaCl ) suppression test confirm exclude diagnosis.The criterion use correspond routine criterion use clinical practice Endocrine Department Karlstad Central Hospital . Intravenous sodium chloride suppression test involve intravenous administration 2 liter NaCl 0,9 % solution give 4 hour medical observation . Post-test plasma aldosterone &gt; 280 pmol/l confirms PA , aldosterone &lt; 140 pmol/l excludes PA normokalemic subject . Patients aldosterone within 140 - 280 pmol/l go offer optimization discontinuation eventual potassium waste diuretic Amiloride minimum 6 week besides measure mention optimization ARR - effectively implement . After optimization period i.v . NaCl suppression test repeat . If result still inconclusive patient consider free PA exclude form analysis . The patient PA confirm evaluated onwards previously describe . Patients bilateral disease offer medical treatment MRA . Patients unilateral disease ( fit willing ) recommend minimally invasive surgical treatment . Treatment result go follow one year , detail outcome measure .</detailed_description>
