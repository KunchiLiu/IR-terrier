	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS : The objective study examine effect watch screen listen music exercise acute energy intake expenditure . It hypothesize post-exercise energy compensation great condition stimuli ( i.e. , screen music ) compare control condition ( i.e. , exercise alone ) . STUDY DESIGN : Randomized , 3-condition crossover study ( within-subjects experimental design ) . PARTICIPANTS : The present study recruit 25 male adolescent age 13 17 year . Participants recruit via advertisement word mouth ( first come first serve approach ) . OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY PROTOCOL : Preliminary Visit The participant attend one baseline session three experimental session . The preliminary visit include measurement related anthropometry ( body weight , height , waist circumference ) rest metabolic rate . Participants also complete questionnaire order well characterize . Experimental Sessions Each participant engage follow three 30-min experimental condition follow ad libitum lunch : ( 1 ) walking/jogging treadmill 60 % VO2 peak watch screen ( exercise + screen ) ; ( 2 ) walking/jogging treadmill 60 % VO2 peak listen music ( exercise + music ) ; ( 3 ) walking/jogging treadmill 60 % VO2 peak stimulus ( control condition ) . MEASUREMENTS : The main measure study include : anthropometric measurement , food intake , appetite sensation , energy expenditure , rest metabolic rate , rating perceive exertion . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure post-exercise energy compensation . The food intake outcome assess use ad libitum test meal immediately condition dietary record remainder day . The energy expenditure outcome assess use Actical accelerometer bedtime . The secondary outcome measure include appetite sensation rating perceive exertion ( OMNI scale ) .</brief_summary>
