	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate analgesic effect intraperitoneal lignocaine ( IPL ) compare intravenous lignocaine ( IVL ) laparoscopic colon resection . We plan run 2 group randomize , double blind , clinical trial look morphine consumption primary outcome . Group 1 ( IV lignocaine ) - IV bolus lignocaine 3 day post operative IV lignocaine infusion . Intra peritoneal ( IP ) bolus normal saline + 3 day post operative IP normal saline infusion Group 2 ( IP lignocaine ) - IV bolus normal saline 3 day post operative IV normal saline infusion . IP bolus lignocaine + 3 post operative IP lignocaine infusion</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over last 20 year , laparoscopic colonic surgery become accept first-line treatment colon cancer . A population-based study show laparoscopic colonic resection perform low hospital cost 90 day discharge compare open surgery . Laparoscopic colonic resection also associate few postoperative complication low mortality . New Zealand one high rate bowel cancer world , second high cause cancer death New Zealand . With implementation bowel screen programme New Zealand , project number stage 1 bowel cancer expect increase . More avenue improve perioperative care need explore improve patient outcome . Controlling postoperative pain effectively show reduce length hospital stay improve patient/clinical outcome . Opioids work Î¼-receptor agonist spinal cord brain , although opioids excellent reduce pain , associate nausea , vomit , dizziness , decrease blood pressure , urinary retention . Epidurals incorporate Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols control post-operative pain . However , epidural invasive procedure significant side effect hypotension , urinary retention , respiratory depression , motor blockade rarely epidural abscess meningitis . It also show 30 percent epidural catheter dislodge , block leak . These complication lead movement towards regional analgesia technique allow local anaesthetic ( LA ) target abdominal wound specifically . Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic ( IPLA ) show promise reduce pain colonic surgery meta-analysis9 , recent IPLA colorectal study conduct Counties Manukau health show reduces pain opioid use effect epidural10 , primarily aim abdominal wound . After IPLA bolus serum local anaesthetic level detectable within 2 minute . Some study show reduce early postoperative pain opioid consumption intravenous lignocaine infusion alone . The question remain however benefit use intraperitoneal local anaesthetic compare administer intravenously IPLA block intraabdominal wound , via local action , skin wound via systemic action.. This investigate four study , however none study compare intravenous local anaesthetic ( IVLA ) IPLA colon resection . The aim , optimise analgesia regime use local anaesthetic , improve patient experience pain recovery thereby achieve early discharge early recovery surgery . This significant economic benefit involve .</detailed_description>
