	<brief_title>Observational Study On The Characterization Of 24-Hour Symptoms In Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective - cross-sectional phase 1 . To describe frequency early-morning , day- night-time COPD symptom accord phenotype cohort Italian patient stable COPD ( GOLD 2014 criterion ) . Symptoms evaluate mean Night-Time , Morning Day-Time symptom COPD questionnaire . Primary objective - longitudinal phase 1 . To describe 12-month frequency evolution early-morning , day- night-time COPD symptom accord phenotype measure enrolment . Symptoms evaluate mean Night-Time , Morning Day-Time symptom COPD questionnaire . Secondary objective - cross sectional phase 1 . To evaluate association early-morning , day- night-time symptom frequency enrolment follow outcome : • dyspnea level • disease severity , define GOLD 2014 criterion ( stag A D ) • quality life • physical activity • quality sleep • frequency severity exacerbation • level depression anxiety Secondary objectives - longitudinal phase 1 . To describe 12-month variation follow outcome accord phenotype measure enrolment : • dyspnea level • quality life • physical activity • quality sleep • frequency severity exacerbation • level depression anxiety 2 . To describe healthcare resource utilization cohort Italian patient COPD 12-month observation , globally phenotypes . STUDY DESIGN : Italian observational cohort multicentre study patient stable COPD PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : 600 patient STUDY PROCEDURE The study plan foresee : -Enrolment visit [ Baseline visit ( V1 ) ] -A control visit 6 month since Baseline investigational site ( V2 ) -A final visit 12 month since Baseline investigational site ( V3 ) The clinical staff investigational site collect retrospectively necessary information medical history patient confirm his-her eligibility . Patients confirm diagnosis stable COPD evaluate enrolment visit , eligible , ask provide write sign privacy inform consent form . The diagnosis stable COPD compliant 2014 GOLD criterion ( stag A D ) . At enrolment visit , patient ask complete questionnaire early-morning , day- night-time symptom , level dyspnea , quality life , physical activity , anxiety depression level , sleep quality , well provide data lifestyle , smoking . The investigator request complete study case report form ( CRFs ) record specify baseline information ( demography data , medical history comorbidities , COPD phenotype , ongoing treatment COPD ) . Finally patient perform spirometry ( baseline , lung volume , bronchodilation test CO diffusion ) accord routine clinical practice . No additional mandate intervention top routinely perform physician visit , examination treatment require . Except completion questionnaire , study-prescribed procedure . Any procedure order physician study one appropriate routine clinical care deliver COPD patient discretion physician . After 6 12 month , information enrolment visit collect , exclude demographic data , ascertain change outcomes interest , include exacerbation medical healthcare resource utilization period visit . At follow visit , patient undergo procedure ( spirometry ) perform enrolment visit . For entire period observation , data regard Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event collect .</detailed_description>
