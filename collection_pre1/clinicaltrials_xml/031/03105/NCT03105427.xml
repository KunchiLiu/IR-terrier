	<brief_title>Leukocytes Cardiovascular Perioperative Events-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Annually , 200 million surgery worldwide . The POISE study reveal 5 % patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery suffer perioperative myocardial infarct go along perioperative mortality rate 11,6 % . Possibilities preoperatively identify patient risk limit prophylactic intervention yet establish controversial . Selected leukocyte subpopulation demonstrate associate high risk cardiovascular event . The aim study evaluate potential use regulatory T cell preoperative risk stratification tool order improve clinical risk stratification reduce perioperative morbidity mortality . Therefore , high-risk cardiovascular patient schedule major non-cardiac surgery recruit . Blood drawn predefined time point surgery three day postoperatively . Leukocytes analyzed flow cytometry . During 30 day follow adverse cardiovascular event record . ECGs record preoperatively post-OP day 3 . High-sensitive cardiac Troponin T measure prior operation post-OP day one three . The patient chart screen cardiovascular event day 30 . A telephone interview perform detect cardiovascular event discharge post-OP day 30 .</detailed_description>
