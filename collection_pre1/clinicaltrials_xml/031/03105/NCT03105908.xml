	<brief_summary>The overall aim present study evaluate internet-delivered Acceptance Commitment therapy treatment ( iACT ) patient chronic pain . More specifically , study evaluate 1 ) iACT effective improve function quality life comparison waitlist condition , 2 ) iACT cost-effective , 3 ) factor influence treatment outcome ( i.e . predictor , moderator characteristics treatment responder ) , 4 ) psychological variable mediate effect treatment outcome , 5 ) subgroup patient varies change process ( i.e . moderate mediation ) . The main hypothesis iACT improve functioning quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internet-delivered ACT Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain affect 12-30 % population often result depression , disability , reduce quality life . Medical strategy often ineffective insufficient alleviate symptom increase function . Instead , empirical support cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) today well establish , intervention commonly see critically important patient chronic pain . However , modest effect size call improvement . Recent development within CBT , particularly Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , suggest utility acceptance mindfulness strategy manage pain distress . The body evidence ACT grown rapidly past decade , ACT today list American Psychological Association treatment chronic pain , strong empirical support . Internet-delivered ACT Despite increased empirical support ACT availability still limit , large number patient receive treatment . In domain , accessibility empirically support treatment increase past decade due development method deliver treatment via internet . For example , large number study illustrate utility internet-delivered CBT anxiety , insomnia depression , treatment effect similar obtained study face-to-face treatment . Few study yet evaluate internet-delivered ACT ( iACT ) chronic pain , recent pilot study group participant suffer fibromyalgia ( n=41 ) illustrate promising result warrant study evaluate effect treatment . Moderators mediator treatment outcome If iACT show effective , vital identify treatment work . For example , possible factor age , pain duration depression may moderate effect treatment . Also , likely individual respond well regular face-to-face treatment benefit internet-delivered intervention . Furthermore , recent study show acceptance pain distress may important mediator change e.g . pain intensity , catastrophizing anxiety . However , study knowledge yet explore subgroup patient ( e.g . men woman ) improve via different change process ( i.e . moderate mediation ) . More information regard moderator mediator change make possible adjust tailor intervention meet specific individual need , thereby increase effect treatment . Recruitment Patients recruit self referral . Thus , information regard study provide newspaper social medium , well direct communication pain clinic primary care unit , include instruction regard e.g . eligibility sign . Once patient find eligible express interest study participation assess psychologist , need pain physician , via semi-structured interview confirm eligibility ensure patient meet study criterion . Informed consent obtain participant prior assessment . Statistical method Evaluations treatment effect primarily base intent-to-treat analysis . The statistical approach primarily base linear multilevel modeling ( LMM ) , take account dependency repeat measure difference patient pre-treatment status treatment response ( i.e . random effect model ) also provide mean handle miss data . More traditional method , ANOVA hierarchical regression , may also utilized appropriate . Analyses change process ( mediation , moderation , moderate mediation ) follow guideline recommendation ( e.g . cross-product coefficient approach , bootstrapping ) . The main health economic outcome incremental cost-effectiveness ratio , measure relationship cost treatment incremental value provide term function , compare control condition .</detailed_description>
