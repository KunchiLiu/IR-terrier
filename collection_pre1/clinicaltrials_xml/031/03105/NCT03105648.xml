	<brief_summary>The prevalence thyroid nodule worldwide high . About 40 % normal population thyroid nodules 5 % malignancy . It important differentiate malignancy benign nodule management completely different . Nowadays , gold standard fine needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) examination . The overall sensitivity specificity fair ( ~90 % ) , still limitation result indeterminate 15 % nodule . These obstacle especially troublesome papillary follicular thyroid cancer lead delay diagnosis , incomplete resection , repeat operation . Preoperative evaluation prognosis extraordinary important cancer management . However , current prognostic score system applicable surgery . Hence , urgently need good risk-stratification system individual-tailored treatment , genetic-based computerized morphometry study seem realistic promise one . The goal study propose reliable method diagnosis prognosis papillary thyroid cancer follicular thyroid cancer analyze cellular morphologic characteristic .</brief_summary>
