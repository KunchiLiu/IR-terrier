	<brief_summary>The objective study determine sensory-mechanical response Eucapneic Voluntary Hyperventilation ( EVH ) Hypertonic Saline ( HS ) individual cough variant asthma ( CVA ) methacholine-induced cough normal airway sensitivity ( COUGH ) compare response control group healthy individual without asthma chronic cough . We hypothesize : 1 . EVH HS cause dyspnea , cough , small airway obstruction resultant dynamic hyperinflation , gas trap autoPEEP individual CVA COUGH , healthy control . 2 . The sensory-mechanical response hyperosmolar challenge ( EVH HS ) comparable within group ( CVA , COUGH healthy control ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic respiratory condition characterize eosinophilic airway inflammation . Individuals classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptom include cough , wheeze , shortness breath chest tightness . Cough variant asthma ( CVA ) asthma chronic cough ( cough lasting eight week ) sole predominant symptom asthma . The pathophysiologic mechanism differentiate asthma , CVA , eosinophilic bronchitis without asthma fully understood . We recently identify individual chronic cough cough methacholine normal airway sensitivity ( ie . asthma CVA ) ( COUGH ) may may eosinophilic bronchitis . The purpose research explore pathophysiologic basis cough condition use two 'indirect ' inhalation challenge test : eucapneic voluntary hyperventilation ( EVH ) hypertonic saline ( HS ) , induce osmotic and/or temperature change airway . Specifically , study collect preliminary data sensory-mechanical response individual CVA , COUGH healthy control EVH HS challenge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals age 1865 year age CVA individual methacholineinduced cough normal airway sensitivity . The following definition use : 1 . CVA : chronic cough ( ≥8 week ) sole predominant symptom positive methacholine challenge ( PC20 ≤ 16 mg/mL ) history cough respond specific asthma treatment ( inhale steroid 1 week trial bronchodilator ) ; 2 . Methacholineinduced cough normal airway sensitivity : chronic cough ( ≥8 week ) sole predominant symptom negative methacholine challenge ( PC20 &gt; 16 mg/mL ) . Individuals age 1865 year age history asthma chronic cough . exacerbation necessitate change medication , emergency department visit hospitalization within previous 4 week inability perform acceptable spirometry medical contraindication methacholine challenge test smoke history excess 10 pack year Note : Previous treatment inhale systemic corticosteroid exclusion criterion ; medication use record examined analysis .</criteria>
