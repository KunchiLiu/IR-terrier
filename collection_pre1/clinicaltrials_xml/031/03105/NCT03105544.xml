	<brief_summary>Detection growth restrict fetus relies primarily abdominal ultrasound examination pregnancy . Many clinician , however , receive systematic training may therefore perform inadequately . We wish examine , whether systematic , simulation-based training improve diagnostic accuracy estimate fetal weight ultrasound different level clinical experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Detection Fetuses Risk - Who Needs Systematic Training ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants physician work obstetric department . Participant characteristic ( age , experience year number monthly scan ) record . Participants perform two abdominal growth scan prior randomization estimate fetal weight compare birth weight . Mean absolute percentage error calculate measure diagnostic accuracy . Participants randomize either control ( intervention ) intervention . The latter group receive train Metaphor Scantrainer trans abdominal ultrasound simulator pas previously validate test . After complete training participant use mannikin practice systematic approach 'knobology ' . All participant perform another two growth scan . Diagnostic accuracy intervention control period compare . We wish examine effect systematic training diagnostic accuracy estimate fetal weight ultrasound across different level clinical experience . If effect find inexperienced participant , simulation-based training obstetric ultrasound could implement part basic obstetric training and/or mean maintain skill .</detailed_description>
