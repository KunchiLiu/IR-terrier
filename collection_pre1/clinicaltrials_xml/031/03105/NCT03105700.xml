	<brief_title>Low Frequency TMS Depression Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study design primarily ass whether patient epilepsy safely tolerate low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation accelerate protocol treat depression . The investigator aim enroll 20 patient temporal lobe epilepsy comorbid depression receive total 14 hour transcranial magnetic stimulation 3 day Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center ( DHMC ) . The investigator assess safety protocol regard seizure frequency side effect TMS treatment feasibility use accelerate protocol patient population . In addition primary aim , secondary goal determine dense array EEG provide useful biomarker depression treatment TLE . A structural MRI obtain treatment dense array EEG TMS treatment ass change specific dense array EEG base biomarkers . In addition recruiting patient , study staff likewise request family member friends patient accompany patient monitor him/her increase seizure frequency . The recruited family member bring patient treatment stay patient overnight local hotel monitor possible seizure adverse event treatment . Family member instruct seizure safety give emergency phone number call patient experience adverse effect TMS .</detailed_description>
