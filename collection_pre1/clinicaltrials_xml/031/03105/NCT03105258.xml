	<detailed_description>This limited institution open label pilot study oral MEK1/2 inhibitor , selumetinib , evaluate potential utility selumetinib 24 adult NF1 cutaneous neurofibroma . The study 's primary objective determine whether selumetinib result shrinkage exist cutaneous neurofibroma ; secondary objective ass selumetinib prevents delay development new cutaneous neurofibroma . All subject commence treatment selumetinib orally 50 mg /dose approximately every 12 hour ( one cycle = 28 day ) . Patients able escalate 75mg every 12 hour [ BID ] , medication tolerate well first cycle , toxicity grade 2 great . Patients undergo regular evaluation selumetinib related toxicity . In absence treatment limit toxicity , progression disease , patient may remain treatment maximum 24 cycle unless experience volume decrease target cutaneous neurofibroma , case treatment may continue additional 12 cycle trial . For response evaluation , target cutaneous neurofibromas 3 different body region measure use paper frame , caliper , photography baseline every 4 cycle . Exploratory study also perform trial ass effect selumetinib skin relate morbidity well cutaneous neurofibroma target inhibition , tumor microenvironment , pathology .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must ≥ 18 year old time enrollment document germline NF1 mutation CLIA certify laboratory diagnosis NF1 base clinical NIH consensus criterion . In addition substantial cutaneous neurofibroma burden define , least one criteria present : Six caféaulait macule ( ≥0.5cm prepubertal subject ≥1.5 cm post pubertal subject ) Freckling axilla groin Optic glioma Two Lisch nodule A distinctive bony lesion ( dysplasia sphenoid bone dysplasia thin long bone cortex ) A firstdegree relative NF1 Histologic confirmation tumor necessary presence consistent clinical finding . Measurable disease : Patients must substantial cutaneous neurofibroma burden cause distress patient disfigurement itching . Patients must ≥ 9 measurable cutaneous neurofibroma . For purpose study measurability define lesion select target lesion neurofibroma long diameter ≥ 3 mm long diameter . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL ( require RBC transfusion ) absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL ( require platelet transfusion ) total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) , exception patient Gilbert Syndrome require &lt; 3 X ULN ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3.0 X ULN creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Hematologic parameter patient undergo biopsy : Patients INR &lt; 1.4 PT ≤ 40 second ( unless due lupus anticoagulant ) . In patient meet parameter , clearance hematology require prior undergoing biopsy . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Willingness avoid excessive sun exposure use adequate sunscreen protection sun exposure anticipate . Willingness avoid ingestion grapefruit Seville orange ( well product contain fruit , e.g . grapefruit juice marmalade ) study . Prior therapy : Since standard effective chemotherapy patient NF1 cutaneous neurofibroma , patient may treat trial without receive prior medical therapy direct PN . Since selumetinib expect cause substantial myelosuppression , limit number prior myelosuppressive regimen previously receive NF1 related tumor manifestation . Patients receive previous investigational agent biologic therapy , tipifarnib , pirfenidone , PegIntron , sorafenib , VEGFR inhibitor eligible enrollment . Growth factor support platelet white cell number function must administer within past 7 day permit study . At least 6 week must elapse prior enrollment since patient receive prior radiation therapy , target cutaneous neurofibromas area outside prior radiation field . At least 4 week must elapse since receive medical therapy direct NF1 related tumor manifestation . At least 4 week must elapse since surgery , evidence complete wound heal . Patients receive prior medical therapy NF1 related tumor must recover acute toxic effect prior therapy ≤ grade 1 CTCAE version 4.0 entering study . The effect selumetinib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 4 week dose selumetinib cease . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior entry . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , patient inform treat physician immediately . Please note selumetinib manufacturer recommend adequate contraception male patient use 12 week postlast dose due sperm life cycle . Informed Consent : Diagnostic laboratory study perform exclusively determine eligibility trial must do obtain write informed consent patient , accomplish use study specific inform consent another consent , NCI , POB screen protocol . Studies procedures perform clinical indication ( exclusively determine eligibility ) may use screen baseline value even study do informed consent obtain , patient agrees . Patients receive investigational agent , receive investigational agent within past 30 day . May NF1 relate tumor optic pathway glioma malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , require treatment chemotherapy , radiation , surgery . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active bleeding diatheses renal transplant , include patient know hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients HIV adequate CD4 count requirement antiviral therapy eligible . Pregnant breastfeeding female exclude due potential risk fetal teratogenic adverse event investigational agent . Males female reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . Abstinence acceptable method birth control . Prior treatment selumetinib another specific MEK 1/2 inhibitor . No supplementation vitamin E permit . Inability swallow capsule , since capsule crush broken . Refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease ) , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . Strong inhibitor inducer hepatic microsomal isoenzymes While exclusion criterion , unless clinically indicate , patient avoid take additional nonstudy medication may interfere study medication . In particular , patient avoid medication know strong inhibitor inducer hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A4/5 , UGT1A1 , UGT1A3 transporter BCRP Pgp . Because list agent constantly change , important regularly consult frequentlyupdated medical reference . As part enrollment/informed consent procedure , patient counsel risk interaction agent , new medication need prescribe patient consider new overthecounter medicine herbal product . Known Cardiac Disorder , include : Uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure [ BP ] ≥150/95 despite medical support/management ) Acute coronary syndrome within 6 month prior start treatment Uncontrolled angina Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade IIIV despite medical support/management Heart failure NYHA Class II ( NYHA Classification refer Appendix II ) Prior current cardiomyopathy include limited following : know hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Known arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Baseline leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≤ 55 % Previous moderate severe impairment leave ventricular systolic function ( LVEF &lt; 45 % echocardiography equivalent MultiGated Acquisition Scan [ MUGA ] ) even full recovery occur . Severe valvular heart disease Atrial fibrillation ventricular rate &gt; 100 bpm ECG rest QTcF interval &gt; 450 msec factor increase risk QT prolongation arrhythmic event ( e.g. , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history long QT interval syndrome ) exclude .
