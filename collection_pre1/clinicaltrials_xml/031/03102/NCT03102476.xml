	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Type 1 Diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) characterise β-cell destruction lifelong requirement exogenous insulin . The basal-bolus insulin regimen widely accept therapy treat hyperglycaemia patient T1DM . This concept require good knowledge individual 's prandial basal insulin requirement . However , insulin requirement depend insulin absorption injection site individual 's insulin sensitivity rely number factor include body composition , inflammatory process environmental factor . Environmental factor difference air temperature could affect , insulin absorption insulin sensitivity suggest recent report . For instance , report hot bath accelerate absorption short-acting long-acting insulin formulation subcutaneous depot . In addition , local warm injection site novel device ( InsuPatch ) result accelerate insulin-action profile short-acting insulin . Moreover , Berglund et al . report seasonal variation insulin sensitivity elderly men increase insulin sensitivity summer time . Although effect temperature insulin absorption action assume , little knowledge effect humidity cumulative effect humidity temperature insulin pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics . For subject type 2 diabetes report accommodation high temperature moist air 75 % impaired compare healthy subject determine skin blood flow , temperature moisture . Although estimate change blood flow due hot moist air affect pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics subcutaneous prandial insulin , knowledge study subject T1D use euglycaemic clamp technique perform . In order ass effect temperature humidity insulin action , subject type 1 diabetes give single dose short-acting insulin environmental chamber either 15°C warm environment 30°C either low high humidity ( 10 % vs. 60 % ) . TRIAL OBJECTIVES The objective trial ass effect different temperature humidity level pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile short-acting insulin subject type 1 diabetes mellitus . TRIAL DESIGN The trial single-centre , open label , 3-way cross-over , euglycaemic glucose clamp trial subject type 1 diabetes mellitus . The pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic property insulin Humalog dose 0.2 U/kg investigate . ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS - 15 °C 10 % humidity - 30 °C 10 % humidity - 30 °C 60 % humidity ASSESSMENTS - 6 visit clinical unit : informed consent screen visit ( Visit 1 , within 28 day prior Visit 2a ) , Pre-dosing visit ( Visit 2a , within 3 day 2b ) , 3 dose visit ( Visit 2b , 3 &amp; 4 , wash-out period 3-21 day visit ) , 1 follow-up ( FUP ) examination ( Visit 5 , 3-14 day last dosing visit ) - Change insulin regimen ( 72 hour prior dose ) : The patient switch Insulin Lantus detemir NPH 48 hour dose visit . The NPH insulin stop 22 hour dose visit except short act insulin stop 6-8 hour visit . - Euglycaemic clamp set 6 hour administration dose Visits 2b , 3 &amp; 4 - Blood collect determination PK insulin concentration Visit 2b , 3 &amp; 4 administration insulin - Blood glucose continuously monitor pre-administration 6 hour administration insulin - Determination skin blood flow via Laser-Doppler - Standard safety parameter assess throughout study .</detailed_description>
