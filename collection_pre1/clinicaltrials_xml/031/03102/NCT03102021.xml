	<brief_title>The Effect Human Recombinant Erythropoietin Acute Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury associate increased morbidity . The common injury kidney occur hospitalization either ischemic nephrotoxic insult kidney . This prolong hospitalization depend severity insult result permanent decrease kidney function . Recent study animal suggest benefit use erythropoietin high dos time kidney injury eividence less injury kidney tissue animal receive treatment compare animal receive saline . Limited human data also suggest use high dose erythropoietin time stroke decrease extent brain injury . In addition cardiac cell culture study also show decrease cell injury use erythropoietin . These study prompt u evaluate admininstering erythropoietin onset acute kidney injury hospitalization may benefit intervention . This pilot study evaluate use high dose erythropoietin administed daily 3 day patient acute kidney injury whether day spend renal failure less receive study medication . Those patient kidney failure either ischemic nephrotoxic insult contraindication erythropoietin use consider study . Informed consent obtain patient next kin</detailed_description>
