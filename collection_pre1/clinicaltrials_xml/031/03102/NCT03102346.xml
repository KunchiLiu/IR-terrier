	<detailed_description>Numerous study reveal cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) myocardial infarction and/or myocardial revascularization result well clinical outcome , include 20 % 56 % decrease all-cause mortality , low cardiac-specific mortality , re-hospitalization , revascularization , good quality life . International guideline endorse strongly recommend CR , especially exercise training ( ET ) patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Unfortunately , even strong evidence , rate participation cardiac rehabilitation percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) historically low worldwide . A variety factor include lackness centre-based supervised program , low referral rate poor compliance patient turn main impediment . In China , morbidity mortality CAD increasing , accompany rapid increase PCI volume , medical cost . By 2015 , totally 567,583 PCI procedure perform , estimate exceed 1,100,000 2020 . As compare exponential increase PCI volume , hospital able develop CR program , suggest severe mismatch need supply CR program . It estimate participation rate CR program China le 1 % . Therefore , important explore understand pattern use CR associate large population CAD patient limit medical resource China . Owing consideration , home-based ET might favorable practical large population Chinese patient undergo PCI compare hospital-based ET due feasibility flexibility well low medical cost . Because home-based CR program could offer important opportunity widen patient access improve adherence , introduce patient myocardial infarction , angina , heart failure undergone revascularization show effective improve clinical health-related quality life outcome . However , doubt safety efficiency home-based CR program cardiologists patient restricted application China . Further , data publish investigate whether home-based CR program effective improve prognosis Chinese CAD patient western country . Therefore , trial design investigate safety efficacy CR program home Chinese patient underwent PCI procedure . This randomized , multicenter , control , prospective observational study . The efficacy safety HBCR revascularized patient evaluated observation clinical characteristic safety indicator . The study expect involve 14 site nationwide , last 21 month initiation April 2017 completion December 2018 , include 9 month recruitment period , 12 month follow-up visit , expect sample size 2,000.The primary endpoint incidence composite major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event ( MACCE , death cause , nonfatal myocardial infarction , revascularization , stroke ) .Secondary endpoint define decrease hospitalization due refractory angina pectoris，the improvement cardiorespiratory fitness , life quality , well angina pectoris . The CAD patient undergone PCI enrol trial randomize 2 different group , HBCR group control group . To identify risk factor CAD , subject supply demographic information medical history ( cardiovascular history , comorbidity , etc ) . Afterwards , receive physical examination evaluation psychological state , nutritional state , exercise habit , well smoke state . Cardiopulmonary exercise test well 6 minute walk test also perform evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness . Then receive optimal drug therapy routine health education tell change lifestyle . Besides intervention , subject HBCR group introduce instruction exercise training home . Seven visit plan study , respectively month 0 , month 1 , month 2 , month 3 , month 6 , month 9 , well month 12 . An exercise regimen decide accord 9th edition ACSM 's guideline exercise test prescription follow target HR/HRAT principle . The target heart rate determine mainly reserve heart rate , sometimes combined heart rate AT . Reserve heart rate equal rest heart rate plus 60-80 percent difference maximal heart rate rest heart rate . If reserve heart rate high heart rate AT , HRAT take final target exercise training . The exercise training start warm 10 minute , follow 30-40 minute aerobatic exercise ( fast walk cycling ) meet target heart rate accord exercise regimen , end cool 10 minute . Besides aerobatic exercise , resistance , stretch balance training also recommend . The aerobatic exercise stretch exercise plan 5-6 time per week , resistance balance training twice thrice week . All kind exercise maintain intensity `` relatively easy slightly tire '' measure Borg Index 11 13 . The investigator employ set CR management system base internet mobile telecommunication technique interact medical staff patient . All information record also system open CR staff patient . The order medication , nutritional guide , smoke cessation advice , anti-anxiety anti-depression advice well exercise training plan send mobile phone patient periodically remind subject implement order . After order implement , subject need confirm via mobile phone . Some health educational material also send subject message wechat app . The investigator also equip subject heart rate band connect CR management system . The heart rate data transmit CR data center reflect partially subjectively whether order CR staff implement . The effect HBCR cardiorespiratory fitness , improvement angina , cardiac function , qualityof life , level anxiety depression , well risk factor profile also evaluate . The safety tolerability HBCR also asscessed . The investigator also try investigate impact cardiorespirotary fitness patient 's clinical symptom , cardiac function , quality life , total mortality , cardiovascular death re-hospitalization due angina exacerbation patient revascularized . The investigator also aim explore factor influence adherence subject within HBCR program . Safety assessment include adverse event ( AE ) , monitor record ( via subject follow-up , patient 's diary card telephone follow-up ) suspect adverse reaction , laboratory test result , vital sign , physical examination 12-lead ECG etc.The subject provide AE-related information investigator follow-up visit . All AEs encode late version MedDRA . This study conduct accordance principle advocate 18th WMA General Assembly ( Helsinki , 1964 ) subsequent amendment , approve ethic committee Chinese PLA General Hospital .</detailed_description>
