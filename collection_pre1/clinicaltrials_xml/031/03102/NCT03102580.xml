	<brief_summary>Knee hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) common cause disability U.S. affect 60 % adult 65 year . As burden knee hip OA increase among age adult , patient decide joint replacement surgery . However , clear guideline exist patient determine undergo total joint replacement ( TJR ) . The investigator plan develop web-based system provide individualized patient OA Care Plans help patient make informed decision treat arthritis . The investigator use system patient see find useful .

	<brief_title>Development Osteoarthritis ( OA ) Care Plan Improve Process Quality OA Treatment Decisions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose prospectively randomize orthopedist , patient , receive ( ) real-time , web-based system intervention : OA Care plan . The OA Care plan include individualize , patient-centric information : ( 1 ) trend patient-reported OA pain function , ( 2 ) tailor estimate likely TJR benefit risk base contemporary US cohort 25,000 TJR patient ( FORCE-TJR Registry ) , ( 3 ) evidence-based information non-operative care , ( 4 ) individual patient goal . Specific Aims include : Aim 1 . Patients Caregivers/Trusted Others refine design , content , usability real-time , web-based individual OA Care plan guide TJR non-operative OA care decision . Aim 2 . Randomize 40 orthopedist , patient , receive OA Care plan time orthopedic consultation ( intervention ) vs. usual care ( control ) compare ( ) OA care decision process quality ( b ) quality OA care measure pain relief functional gain two arm 6 12 month decision , assess impact decision quality quality OA care . Aim 3 . Randomize 54 orthopedist , patient , receive OA Care plan plus peer , family , primary care physician support ( OA Care plan+Support ; intervention ) vs. OA Care plan alone compare quality OA care decision quality care ( pain relief , functional gain ) two arm . Based component Chronic Care Model , technology-delivered , individualized OA Care plan enable patient clinician make treatment decision base patient symptom , goal , comparative effectiveness evidence . The investigator hypothesize OA Care plan user , compare usual care , report great decision quality TJR non-operative care , good quality care ( less OA pain , great function ) . Further , investigator anticipate incremental effectiveness OA Care plan+Support ( peer , family , primary care support ) outcomes . Study result guide future OA Care plan implementation assure optimal healthcare patient advance knee hip OA . Finally , lesson learn evaluation automate patient-centric decision support system extend beyond OA TJR elective surgical procedure engage informed patient make optimal individual decision .</detailed_description>
