	<brief_summary>Bile duct stone common biliary tract disease , characterize high morbidity frequent recurrence . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) effective therapy common bile duct stone , endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST ) associate recurrent cholangiolithiasis often carry difficult intubation extract stone , probably due enhance reflux intestinal content change microenvironment . Patients cholangiolithiasis consecutively recruit bile collect intra-operatively high-throughput experiment . Pyrosequencing 16S ribosomal RNA gene perform characterize microbiota bile body fluid . A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based method use profile bile composition . Clinical manifestation , microbiome , bile composition compare patient without recurrent bile duct stone . The aim study identify impact microbiomes recurrent bile duct stone ERCP+EST therapy .</brief_summary>
