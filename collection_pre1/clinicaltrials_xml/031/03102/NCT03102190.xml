	<brief_title>Trial Topical Verapamil Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CRSwNP prevalent disease associate major direct indirect cost . Acute Chronic Rhinosinusitis estimate affect 16 % US population . They account approximately 11 million 1 % office visit per year US common cause antibiotic prescription community . CRS alone impact 30 million Americans result $ 6.9 $ 9.9 billion annual healthcare expenditures $ 12.8 billion productivity cost . The subset patient Europe CRSwNP estimate 2 4.3 % think similar US . This population remain one challenging subgroup CRS manage effectively . Recent evidence focus sinonasal epithelial cell primary driver local dysregulated immune response secretion type 2 helper T-cell ( Th2 ) promote cytokine . While study suggest epithelial cell capable orchestrate local immune response , mechanism responsible regulate cytokine secretion poorly understood may influence efflux function epithelial P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) . Studies investigator 's group demonstrate P-gp overexpressed mucosa patient Th2 skew CRS endotypes include CRSwNP capable regulate secretion Th2 polarizing cytokine . Together , finding suggest P-gp participates non-canonical regulation cytokine secretion within CRSwNP may thereby represent druggable target . The investigator 's group therefore undertook randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial test efficacy low dose oral Verapamil HCl , know first generation P-gp inhibitor , treatment CRSwNP . Our finding demonstrate significant efficacy primary secondary endpoint significant side effect . However , logistic regression analysis reveal two important relationship baseline characteristic efficacy . First , patient elevate BMI significantly low improvement Sinonasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22 ) ( p=0.01 ) . The second patient high total mucus P-gp level experience less benefit ( p=0.01 ) . While Verapamil HCl significant potential treatment CRSwNP P-gp inhibition , high dos must achieve extend effect patient elevate BMIs high level P-gp expression . As increase oral dosing could result cardiac side effect , topical delivery represent promise alternative . As exosome bound P-gp may stable representative disease state total mucus P-gp concentration , exosomal P-gp demand exploration novel biomarker disease severity drug response .</detailed_description>
