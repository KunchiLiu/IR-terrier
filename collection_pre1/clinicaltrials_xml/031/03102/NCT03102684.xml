	<brief_summary>Limited study evaluate potential exposure secondhand e-cigarette aerosol , indication impact indoor air quality . Also limited study regard direct passive exposure human study limitation , small number participant , different methodology device use , fact laboratory study , exposure parameter differ significantly actual user 's habit device . Therefore , TackSHS Project foreseen intervention study cross-over design similar real-life condition aim ass mediate effect e-cigarette battery output pulmonary outcome index provide good understanding extent passive exposure aerosol produce use e-cigarette impact exhale NO exhale breath condensate metabolite .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Secondhand Exposure E-cigarettes Aerosols Respiratory System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study part large research project ( TackSHS ) fund European Union 's Horizon 2020 Research Innovation Programme ( Grant Agreement No 681040 ) . The current study main aim assess impact passive exposure aerosol produce use e-cigarettes index lung function ( respiratory mechanic exhale biomarkers ) among healthy adult . To achieve objective , conduct laboratory base intervention study cross-over design perform `` George D Behrakis RESEARCH LAB '' Hellenic Cancer Society . Specifically , three trial arm perform ( exposure e-cigarette aerosol ( 1 ) vs. low e-cigarette aerosol exposure ( 2 ) vs. high e-cigarette aerosol exposure ( 3 ) ) subject participate three trial arm . Each trial arm base around two battery power output , one key factor related production e-cigarette aerosol . Sample size : The study sample 40 participant . The participant randomize sequence exposure , thus participant request participate three trial-arms . In total , 120 person-exposures take place ( 3 trial-arms x 40 adult ) duration project , lead 240 pre post measurement . Study Population : Recruitment take place within community set Athens ( Greece ) among volunteer . Two type participant request : 1 . Healthy non-smokers - expose e-cigarette aerosol ( secondhand exposure ) 2 . Healthy e-cigarette user - create e-cigarette exposure Intervention An intervention arm 2 3 30-minute exposure aerosol produce use e-cigarette experience user . The difference arm 2 3 exposure would lie distinct opposition electric current e-cigarette battery ( resistance ) , particularly , low ( arm 2 ) high ( arm 3 ) battery resistance use . Each volunteer give appropriate information exposure health effect . Measurements : The follow measurement perform arm : - Exhaled CO - Oscillometry - Exhaled NO ( FeNO ) - Exhaled Breath Condensate ( EBC ) - Environmental measurement - PM1 , PM2.5 Equipment use : - Bedfont microsmokelyser - Sidepak TSI - Viasys , Vmax series body-box system - Viasys , Jaeger Masterscreen IOS system : ( heat pneumotach , resistance=0.05 kPa/ ( L/s ) 10 L/s ) , line ATS/ERS task force guideline 2005 25 - ECO Medics , AG CLD 88 chemilluminescense , Spiroware 3.021 - Turbo-Deccs EBC - Thermoscientific Deepfreezer Exposures take place within standardized exposure chamber successfully use similar protocol exposure secondhand tobacco smoke conventional cigarette . The chamber allow control environmental condition exposure verify measure change outcomes attributable solely trial-arm . All individual take part , inform responsible physician , regard study , specific test undergo , procedure , clinical significance impact . He/She also provide answer possible question , well information regard follow issue : - The purpose information collect , include aim , method implication research ; - The extent personal data use access various partner ( make clear data pertain store handle anonymous manner use encrypt - personally identifiable- code ) ; - The participant 's right access personal data and/or study data ; - The participant 's right withdraw participation study , point , without consequence without obligation explanation justification If individual agrees participate , he/she confirm read information sheet provide consent researcher . The result medical test include study , give participant along correspond diagnostic interpretation . All individual participate study freely access personal data , make clear study participant research result project return subject . However , data relate entire project publicly disseminate process protect . This accessed project website publication relate project . It make clear subject completely free withdraw record participation time . It make clear consent give participant project withdrawn time , without explanation justification . In case data pertain subject question destroy . The result medical test include study , give participant along correspond diagnostic interpretation . All individual participate study freely access personal data , make clear study participant research result project return subject . However , data relate entire project publicly disseminate process protect . This accessed project website publication relate project . All measurement conduct trained clinical researcher . Besides information sociodemographic characteristic , data smoke consumption e-cigarette use tobacco variable also collect . Data save electronic format protect password . Only select number pre- designated member data collection team access laptop . Once data collection complete , data upload single database reliably completely deleted laptop . Selected personal data , include name respondent , collect enable quality assurance procedure allow participant willing withdraw participation survey record delete database . Once quality assurance procedure complete ( within 4 month completion data collection ) , names unique personal identifier ( full address ) reliably completely delete . Statistical analysis focus identify deterministic effect also investigation potential dose-response effect lower vs. high exposure e-cigarette aerosol . Once complete dataset participant merge clean , data analyse use SPSS . Specific analysis allow u investigate association exposure e-cigarette emission 1. index lung mechanic ( impedance , resistance , reactance , resonant frequency , frequency dependence resistance ) 2. exhaled biomarkers ( exhale NO level EBC level 8-isoprostane ) . The model also allow adjustment potential confound subject-level factor provide estimate within subject variance component correlation . The TackSHS project coordinate Dr. Esteve Fernandez Institut Catala d'Oncologia ( ICO ) ( SPAIN ) . This study manage `` George D Behrakis RESEARCH LAB '' , within Hellenic Cancer Society ( HCS ) ( Greece ) , collaboration Institut Catala d'Oncologia ( ICO ) ( SPAIN ) Public Health Agency Barcelona ( ASPB ) ( SPAIN ) partner .</detailed_description>
