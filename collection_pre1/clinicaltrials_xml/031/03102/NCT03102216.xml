	<brief_summary>The 2015 Abbott Point-of-Care Great Minds Summit Berlin present novel research show potential upfront , point-of-care ( POC ) blood test improve wait time , cost patient flow Emergency Department ( ED ) . POC test become focus area enquiry EDs worldwide look way cope over-crowding reduce wait time . In South African EDs , target time patient see dictate triage category . Patients triaged Red ( critical ) ideally see immediately , Orange within 10 minute , Yellow within 1 hour Green within 4 hour arrival . Whilst patient may initially evaluate within time frame , may delay final disposition due time lag obtain result special test and/or investigation . Traditionally , blood test special investigation electrocardiogram ( ECG ) radiological investigation ( x-rays ) take place doctor evaluate patient . Patients ( doctor ) wait result test decision make regard patient 's final disposition . Instead send blood specimen laboratory analysis , POC blood test refers select test perform ED provide immediate on-site result thus potential expedite patient management decision . Similarly , low dose x-ray ( LODOX® ) radiological equivalent POC blood test provide full body x-ray within 19 second . LODOX evaluate trauma patient previously application screen tool non-trauma patient ED properly explore thus far . Electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) commonly use clinical medicine POC test evaluate heart . Locally , Helen Joseph Hospital ED Johannesburg constant influx critically ill injured patient 24 hour day . The aim investigator-initiated , prospective , randomise control trial compare assess standard workflow pathway currently use ED modify pathway make use upfront , early POC test ( blood test , ECG and/or LODOX ) see use significant effect cost , wait time associated patient flow pattern ED .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Helen Joseph Hospital ED constant influx critically ill injured patient 24 hour day . On average , 170 - 200 patient triaged evaluated per day - approximately 60 000-70000 patient per annum . EDs world-wide constantly look way decrease patient over-crowding wait time . Suggested solution include hire additional personnel , create observation unit , ambulance diversion triage . Some even try improve patient flow place senior consultant triage area . In South African EDs , South African Triage Scale ( SATS ) utilise assess severity acuity patient present ED . The target time patient see dictate triage category . Patients triaged Red ideally see immediately , Orange within 10 minute , Yellow within 1 hour Green within 4 hour arrival . Whilst patient may initially evaluate within time frame , may delay final disposition due time lag obtain result special investigation . Traditionally , investigation ED take place doctor evaluate patient . Patients ( doctor ) wait result investigation . Further decision patient ' ultimate disposition ( i.e . either discharge home admit inpatient care ) thus contingent upon result investigation . POC blood testing ( opposed send blood laboratory analyse ) show accurate assist expedite patient management decrease turnaround time result . Low dose x-ray ( LODOX® ) market quick easy radiological screen tool trauma patient even use triage tool . The LODOX produce full body antero-posterior x-ray image within 19 second . It much quicker expose patient less radiation standard radiograph/x-ray . It therefore also categorise x-ray equivalent POC test . Its use never evaluate tool non-trauma patient ED . Electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) commonly use clinical medicine POC test evaluate heart . The aim study therefore assess whether , individually combination , upfront , early POC blood test , ECGs and/or LODOX decrease wait time , reduce cost improve patient flow ED .</detailed_description>
