	<brief_title>Atezolizumab Immunotherapy Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II pilot trial combine neoadjuvant immunotherapy Atezolizumab q 21 day 12 week standard chemoradiotherapy curative intent good PS patient unresectable stage IIIA/B NSCLC . Because consequence progression curative-intent population , restaging CT scan carry first 2 cycle neoadjuvant therapy . Non progress patient complete total one year anti-PDL1 therapy interruption chemoradiotherapy . Patients evidence progression first restaging evaluation proceed immediately chemoradiotherapy still eligible curative intent therapy .</detailed_description>

Stage III A B disease minimum diagnostic evaluation within 6 week include : History/physical examination Contrast enhance CT chest upper abdomen MRI brain contrast ( CT contrast MRI medically contraindicate ) PET/CT If pleural fluid visible CT scan thoracentesis exclude malignancy obtain . Patients effusion small tap eligible . Patients must least 4 week major surgery must fully recover Age great equal 18 year . Representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor specimens paraffin block least 4 unstained slide , associate pathology report , central test tumor PDL1 expression . If archived tumor block exist , either block least 4 unstained slide block submit . Tumor tissue good quality base total viable tumor content , i.e . least 50 viable tumor cell intact tissue architecture . Fine needle aspiration , brushing , lavage sample acceptable . If block tissue coreneedle biopsy , block contain tissue least three core sufficient evaluation .
