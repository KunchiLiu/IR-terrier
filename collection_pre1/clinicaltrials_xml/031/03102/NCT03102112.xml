	<brief_summary>Malignant glioma common deadly primary brain tumor adult . The clinical outcome patient glioblastoma depend key molecular genetic alteration . Specifically , Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Gene Mutation , independent favorable prognostic factor , serve diagnostic prognostic marker glioma . Thus , accurate grading glioma fundamental order determine treatment strategy . Amide proton transfer ( APT ) image noninvasive molecular MRI technique base chemical exchange saturation transfer mechanism detect endogenous mobile protein peptide biological tissue . Preliminary study show APT-weighted ( APTw ) signal intensity could serve new image biomarker , reveal significantly high signal intensity high-grade glioma compare low-grade glioma . The purpose study investigate value amide proton transfer imaging ( APT ) noninvasive evaluation isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) gene status glioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Materials Methods : The whole brain MRI examination perform 3.0-T MRI system ( Discovery MR750 , General Electric Medical System , Milwaukee , WI , USA ) eight-channel head coil ( General Electric Medical System ) . Conventional MRI , contrast-enhanced MRI , DWI amide proton transferimaging perform regular sequence examination . Finally , contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin echo sequence acquire transverse , sagittal , coronal plane intravenous administration 0.01 mmol/kg gadodiamide ( Omniscan ; GE Healthcare , Co. Cork , Ireland ) . MRI data processing image analysis : All data transfer workstation ( Advantage Workstation 4.6 , General Electric Medical System , Milwaukee , Wisconsin , USA ) processing.The MR imaging patient assess independently two experienced neuroradiologist ( HYC YLF , 12 6 year experience , respectively , neurologic-oncologic imaging ) blind patient 's information . Next , region interest ( ROI ) drawn manually solid part tumor relatively higher signal intensity APT image . Statistical analysis : Categorical data obtain image calculate use Fisher 's exact test . Quantitative data denote mean standard deviation . The Kolmogorov-Smirnov ( K-S ) test use assess normality data distribution.APT-weighted ( APTw ) signal intensity test difference IDH mutation IDH wild-type use independent sample test .</detailed_description>
