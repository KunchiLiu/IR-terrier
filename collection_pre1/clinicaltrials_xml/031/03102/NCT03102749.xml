	<brief_summary>New insight small airway contribution asthma gain . Poor level control recurrent exacerbation show phenotypic counterpart asthma predominant small airway involvement . Very pathological specificity identify site : mast cell infiltration suggest specific inflammatory change compare proximal airways.Biomarkers asthma still complex validate , especially blood , since compartmentalisation intense lung airway , property attribute filtering role lung maintain homeostasis . Over last year , Fraction exhale Nitric Oxide ( FENO ) develop non-invasive indirect reflection airway eosinophilic inflammation ] . In blood , peripheral eosinophil count show correct T helper 2 ( TH2 ) -phenotype identifier perfectly relate airway eosinophilic infiltration . Club cell secretory protein ( SCGB1A1 ) level show relevance asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , BOS , sarcoidosis , lung cancer.A biomarker small airway disease asthma may improve management disease , identify area therapeutic resistance constitute therapeutic guidance tool . In study , investigator aim assess small airway involvement asthmatic woman far could . For purpose , investigator analyse trend air trap acquire expiratory CT slice dose bronchoprovocation test metacholine . Biomarkers subsequently test confronted clinical demographical characteristic ability predict small airway involvement index obtain CT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients recruit respiratory department University Hospital Montpellier ( France ) June 2012 March 2014 . All patient asthmatic , order avoid gender-related bias , investigator decide include woman . All participant normal range spirometry , specifically regard force expiratory volume . Each patient undergo bronchial provocation test couple thoracic CT scan . Bronchial alveolar Nitric Oxyde also measure , blood sample obtain order measure biomarker concentration , patient ask answer validated Asthma Control Questionnaire order quantify asthma control .</detailed_description>
