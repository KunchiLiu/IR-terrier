	<brief_summary>Glucose sugar carry blood stream body use energy . If someone diabetes , blood glucose level erratic , sometimes become low call Hypoglycaemia ( `` hypo '' ) , happen blood glucose level drop 4 mmol/l . So far order prove hypo happen patient , blood glucose level measure time hypo . In study try identify certain chemical substance ( biomarkers ) diabetic patient may measure blood test patient 24 hour hypo could prove hypo happen could adjust tablet insulin dosage way prevent hypo . The study conduct Diabetes Centre Hull Royal Infirmary involve three visit diabetes centre . The study finish week time first visit . Visit 1 screen visit identify eligibility take part study . Visit 2 insulin infusion give make participant blood sugar level fall lower normal short time correct quickly afterward . This stress participant 's body stimulate certain chemical try identify hypo . In Visit 3 , main purpose visit do 24 hour insulin infusion take blood sample check participant visit 2 . We recruit 25 Type 2 Diabetic patient 25 none diabetic compare result . Both group ischemic heart disease , underactive thyroid seizure stable dosage medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Identify Biomarkers Hypoglycaemia Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background information It well recognise patient type 1 type 2 diabetes suffer repeat hypoglycaemia risk death significant morbidity ( 1 ) . This major clinical importance currently , record low blood sugar time hypoglycaemia give confirmation hypoglycaemic event take place . There many instance confirmation exclusion hypoglycaemic event would beneficial . Landmark study Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) ) ( 2 ) type 1 diabetes numerous large study ( UKPDS , ACCORD , ADVANCE , VADT ( 1 , 3-7 ) ) design look whether intensive diabetes control type 2 diabetes reduce microvascular macrovascular cardiovascular event , help establish glycaemic target contribute prevent development worsen retinopathy , nephropathy neuropathy . What study exemplify glycaemic control become strict , risk hypoglycaemia increase ( defined blood glucose fall le 3.9mmol/l accord American Diabetes Association guideline ) ( 1 , 6 , 7 ) . For many patient , main barrier achieve optimal glycaemic target prevent complication increase risk hypoglycaemia remain feared complication intensify diabetes therapy patient health care professional . Although hypoglycaemia traditionally consider complication treatment type 1 diabetes , recently recognise problem people type 2 diabetes particularly intensive insulin therapy ( 8 ) . In type 1 diabetes , patient average experience two symptomatic event per week one severe event , latter responsible 2-4 % death . In type 2 diabetes risk severe hypoglycaemic event 7 % first year follow diagnosis rise 25 % thereafter . There multiple concern impact hypoglycaemic event may lead pathological , social economic consequence . In ACCORD study , risk death significantly increase one episode severe hypoglycaemia intensive standard study treatment arm ( 1 , 9 ) . As plasma glucose fall 4.0mmol/L , series defensive response mechanism occur , individualised glycaemic threshold , reverse hypoglycaemia include rise catecholamine , cortisol glucagon level ( 10 ) . This may lead hypokalemia , prolong QT interval , cardiac arrhythmia ( 11 ) . It may also lead increase oxidative stress ( 12 ) ; impair cardiovascular autonomic function 16 hour afterwards ( 13 ) ; increase inflammatory marker ( 14 ) ; platelet activation ( 15 ) promote vascular damage . These change might clinically relevant hypoglycaemia associate cardiac ischemia ( chest pain ) 72-h continuous glucose monitoring along simultaneous cardiac Holter monitoring perform people ischemic heart disease type 2 diabetes treat insulin ( 16 ) . A study , people type 1 diabetes healthy control , suggest increase platelet activation hypoglycaemia ( 15 , 17 ) emphasising increase risk hypoglycaemia may cardiovascular event . All change may therefore result generation biomarkers may able identify occurrence hypoglycaemia event blood glucose reverse normal rebound hyperglycaemic level result . This particular value hypoglycaemic unawareness , nocturnal hypoglycaemia event uncertain aetiology hypoglycaemia part differential diagnosis . An ability determine whether hypoglycaemic event occur measurement biomarker major impact confidence patient healthcare provider allow glycaemic control optimise glycaemic target reach stringent diabetes therapeutic treatment regimen . The ability identify nocturnal hypoglycaemia particular value patient circumvent need continuous glucose monitoring enforce wake 3am blood glucose measurement currently rely . Identification biomarkers hypoglycaemia great value elderly population often difficult determine cause , example , feel non specifically unwell , poor concentration , fall faint , particularly often multiple morbidity treat time ( 18 ) . From economic perspective recognise hypoglycaemia directly account 95 % endocrine relate emergency hospitalisation ( 19 ) recognise severe hypoglycaemia associate total cost around £2,152 ( 20 ) It see new method determine hypoglycaemia biomarker determination may help prevent severe hypoglycaemia earlier recognition prevent death morbidity . One promising biomarker endothelial Microparticles heterogeneous population vesicle play relevant role pathogenesis vascular disease , cancer metabolic diseases diabetes mellitus . They release virtually cell type shed cell growth , proliferation , activation , apoptosis senescence process . ( 21 ) Microparticles consistently present blood stream ( 22 ) main regulator cell cell interaction , carry specific membrane antigens host cell , thereby act diffusible vector trancellular exchange biological information ( 23 ) . Microparticles expose membrane protein mother cell example CD31 endothelial cell proportion platelet . ( 24 ) CD105 , CD106 , CD142 , CD54 , CD62E Endothelial cell nature . ( 25-28 ) An increase level circulate Microparticles suggest one procoagulant determinants patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( 29 ) Circulating level CD31+ ( PECAM-1 ) , CD105+ , CD106+ 62E+ endothelial-derived MPs well increase concentration fibrinogen+ , tissue factor , P-selectin+ platelet-derived MPs show significantly increase T2DM patient compare non-diabetic control ( 25 , 26 ) Indeed , platelet patient T2DM characterise hyperreactive phenotype enhance adhesion , aggregation , activation ( 30 ) , may contribute pathogenesis atherothrombotic complication ( 31-33 ) . Therefore , high level specific endothelial platelet Microparticles circulate blood patient atherosclerotic disease , use biomarkers vascular injury potential predictor cardiovascular outcome , especially diabetic patient ( 34-37 ) . Aims Objectives Objectives : Identification comparison Microparticles ( CD105 , CD106 , CD31 , CD54 , CD62E , CD142 ) follow hypoglycemic event patient type 2 diabetes subject without type 2 diabetes . Study Design Prospective parallel study perform Diabetes research centre , Hull Royal Infirmary involve patient type 2 diabetes control group without diabetes</detailed_description>
