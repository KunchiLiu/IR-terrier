	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effect medication ketamine medication call nitroprusside patient major depression . Ketamine good bad effect . Some study show ketamine improves depression . However , study also show cause strange sometimes unpleasant sensation refer `` psychotic '' `` dissociative '' symptom . An example psychotic symptom would hear see something reality . The study team would like see nitroprusside prevent report bad effect ketamine without block report good effect . This might make ketamine good treatment depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ketamine effective fast-acting therapeutic intervention patient treatment refractory depression know unwanted effect induce temporary psychotomimetic symptom ( i.e. , delusion , hallucination think disorganization ) patient . The precise mechanism psychotropic effect remain elucidated , several decade NMDA-type glutamate receptor hypothesize central importance . In vain , recent study antihypertensive agent nitroprusside - increase availability molecular nitric oxide , know by-product NMDA activity - find evidence antipsychotic property human psychotic illness healthy subject give ketamine . Here , clinical team propose study build work evaluate effect nitroprusside antidepressant psychotomimetic effect ketamine give patient treat refractory depression . In addition , exploratory aim , collect serial blood sample subject , subject administer ketamine nitroprusside , clinical team seek determine functional marker therapeutic effect mechanism ketamine modulates mood psychotic state Research Question : The clinical team test whether effect ketamine ( KET ) mood psychotic state modify co-administration sodium nitroprusside ( NP ) patient depression . Furthermore , clinical team evaluate extent underlie biology disease state drug mechanism infer analysis brain-derived molecular material isolate peripheral circulation . Specific Aims : Aim I . To test whether co-administration NP impact efficacy KET antidepressant . Aim II : To test ability NP prevent psychotomimetic effect KET patient depression . Research Hypotheses : Research Hypothesis I . Patients pre-treated NP experience attenuate antidepressant effect ( measure MADRS score ) follow KET compare pre-treatment placebo . Research Hypothesis II : Patients pre-treated NP experience attenuate psychotomimetic effect ( e.g. , CADSS score ) immediately follow KET compare pre-treatment placebo .</detailed_description>
