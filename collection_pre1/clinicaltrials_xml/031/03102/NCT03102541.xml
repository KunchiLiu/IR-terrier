	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) occur approximately one-third patient undergo cardiac surgery ( CS ) , represent one significant negative predictor patient outcome population . To date , therapy prevent AKI . In healthy adult , high protein meal know enhance glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) mediate increase renal blood flow . The investigator hypothesize preoperative oral protein load may induce adaptive response kidney , precondition kidney upcoming insult . In present study , investigator aim compare prevalence severity AKI patient undergo oral high protein load age- gender-matched `` control '' receive protein load cardiac surgery within period ( October 2014-November 2015 ) San Bortolo Hospital , Vicenza , Italy .</detailed_description>
