	<detailed_description>For decade pathologic nodal status early breast cancer paramount importance , evaluate need adjuvant therapy . Nowadays tumor characteristic receptor status gene expression essay increasingly included decision process . An increase number breast cancer patient treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) . A downstaging axillary tumor-spread achieve 40 % patient receive NACT . The contribution NACT loco-regional tumor control fully integrated surgical treatment plan . The introduction sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) result ACOSOG ( American College Surgeons Oncology Group ) Z0011 trial lead reduction radicalness axillary surgery adjuvant setting . The impact NACT loco-regional tumor control neoadjuvant setting yet sufficiently investigate . Moreover pathologic nodal status NACT strong prognostic marker . Therefore desirable identify approximately 40 % patient pathologic complete response axilla distinguish patient tumor residual might need additional postneoadjuvant treatment . So far attempts identify patient via SLNB NACT fail provide acceptable false negative rate ( FNR ) report SENTINA ( Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy patient breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) trial ACOSOG Z1071 trial . Attempts bee make improve FNR SLNB NACT patient clinically affect lymph node initial presentation . A new concept surgical axillary stag NACT target axillary dissection ( TAD ) . First result show reduce FNR far desire threshold 10 % . In procedure clinically suspicious lymph node evaluate core needle biopsy ( CNB ) fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) NACT . A clip place suspicious appear lymph node ( target lymph node TLN ) directly biopsy . In case proven metastasis surgical stag axilla postpone completion NACT . The targeted resection clip node NACT ( target lymph node biopsy TLNB ) display FNR 2 - 4.2 % accord first result publish Caudle et al . 2016 . In 3 4 patient TLN equal SLN SLNB perform simultaneously . The combination TLNB SLNB ( together call TAD ) seem low FNR . Cases tracer uptake lymph node impair i.e . tumor residual presumably result false negative SLNB cover TLNB . Clip placement affect axillary lymph node purpose follow target resection implement international guideline . But date multiple insight clinical application TAD miss . It know often initial CNB/FNA axillary lymph node follow clip placement successful abandon technical/medical contraindication . Moreover know often visualization clip normalization lymph node structure follow NACT month initial clip placement possible . Furthermore information optimal clip material lacking . In summary success rate target resection clip node investigate . Therefore intraoperative detection rate clip target lymph node primary outcome measure . Patients clinically affect lymph node initial presentation plan enrol multiple german breast center . In accorndance german guideline aim evaluate pathologic nodal status via CNB follow clip placement patient informed consent . If CNB clip placement achieve , technical/medical contraindication record . As SenTa trial registry trial , strict directive surgical treatment make . If clip placement successful , procedure leave investigator choice accord initial pathologic nodal status potential clinical response NACT . If tumor manifestation detect initial CNB , SLNB simultaneous target resection clip node ( TLNB ) recommend . The rationale TLNB situation FNR 20 % initial CNB . On individual basis upfront ALND offer . If tumor manifestation detect initial CNB , target resection clip node ( TLNB ) strongly recommend obvious reason . If NACT plan , upfront ALND offer . If patient plan NACT procedures leave investigator discretion accord clinical response NACT . Clinical response NACT assess axillary ultrasound optional needle biopsy applicable . In case clinical complete response , TLNB simultaneous SLNB offer individual basis .</detailed_description>
