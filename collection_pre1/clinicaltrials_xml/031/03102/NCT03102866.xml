	<brief_title>Aerobic Strength Training Exercise Improving Fitness Arm Health During After Radiation Therapy Patients With Stage II-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility conduct exercise program radiation therapy determine percent patient complete exercise program . ( Pilot ) II . To determine percent increase fitness measure 6 minute walk test woman receive radiation therapy breast cancer randomize exercise program 1 year . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Percent adherence exercise 1 year measure International Physical Activity Questionnaire exercise log . II . Subjective arm health 1 year measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Questionnaire Breast Cancer version 4 ( FACT-B+4 ) . III . Arm lymphedema 1 year measure arm circumference . IV . Arm range motion 1 year measure goniometry . V. Quality life 1 year measure FACT-B+4 . VI . Percent increase arm strength measure one repetition maximum 1 year . VII . Change weight body mass index ( BMI ) 1 year completion radiation . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive usual care 6 week radiation therapy 12 week completion radiation therapy . ARM II : Patients undergo supervise aerobic strength training exercise session 40-60 minute 3 time weekly 6 week radiation therapy 12 week completion radiation therapy . After completion study , patient follow 1 6 month , 1 year .</detailed_description>
