	<brief_summary>Exosomes part extracellular vesicle ( EVs ) , secrete environment many type cell . It demonstrate content function exosomes depend originate cell condition produced.Exosomes contain protein , RNAs lipid , may transfer biological information activity donor cell receptor cell . Non-coding RNAs involve many biological activity include tumor growth metastasis . In prospective translational study , preclinical clinical phase design . On first step , main goal characterize ncRNAs cholangiocarcinoma derive exosomes . This exosome biomarker may provide useful diagnostic tool . As second step , study evaluate prognostic predictive value cholangiocarcinoma exosomes level plasma prospectively recruit cohort cholangiocarcinoma patient surgical resection .</brief_summary>
