	<brief_summary>Patients affect Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) need safe effective long-term treatment regimen . Unfortunately , still disease-specific treatment ADPKD approve US . A rational step towards identify agent test therapy prove safety profile mechanisms action counter disease progression . The purpose study investigate whether drinking increase amount water ( water load ) might slow polycystic kidney growth kidney function decline . Water load cause suppression pathway cause fluid buildup cyst growth . High water intake safely used clinical setting , case kidney stone therapy . New York State tap water widely available safe , make highly cost-effective well .</brief_summary>
