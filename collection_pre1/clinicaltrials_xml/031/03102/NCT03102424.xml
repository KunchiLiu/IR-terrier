	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator Improve Blood Glucose Control Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , prospective , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator ( DW1330 ) improve blood glucose control patient type 2 diabetes . Subjects type 2 diabetes meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize either 2 group : 1 . DW1330 2 . Placebo ( sham TENS deliver ineffective pulse wave ) After enrollment , subject randomly assign receive one study treatments double-blind fashion . All patient enrol perform 1 treatment within 1 hour dinner 5 day week . The end 20 week treatment period , subject follow additional 2 week safety follow-up . The time frame include 2 week screen , 20 week treatment , 2 week post-treatment follow-up . Study visit occur every 2 4 week depend study phase . At randomization visit study device dispense site , treatment period visit , Adverse Events ( AEs ) well follow-up AEs resolve record , change concomitant medication note , vital sign take , efficacy evaluation perform well . Investigators , site staff , subject , study team blind device assign . The study include collection blood urine sample . The end-of-treatment visit last estimation glycemic control occur week 20 ( visit 8 ) subject . In addition , 2-week follow occur order collect safety data device return . The final visit week 22 ( visit 9 ) . Subjects encourage complete plan visit regardless adherence study device administration .</detailed_description>
