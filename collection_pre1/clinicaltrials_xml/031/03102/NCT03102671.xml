	<brief_summary>The recurrence major cardiac event infarction high , population 20 % first year . Optimal secondary prevention organize cardiac rehabilitation center effective reduce morbidity mortality . However , many study show participation adherence rate CR-programs low European country . Therefore , novel way deliver secondary prevention use information technology self-monitoring explore . Hence , study investigate effectiveness mobile , patient tailor , app base multidisciplinary telerehabilitation program ( HeartHab app ) improve exercise capacity , lifestyle risk factor patient coronary artery disease post-rehabilitation setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design population This study prospective double-arm , non-pragmatic , cross-over , randomize control trial . Approximately 30 subject select retrospectively cardiology database Jessa Hospital Hasselt . Subjects violate predefined exclusion criterion provide informed consent randomly assign 1:1 ratio treatment strategy ( AB sequence BA sequence ) . After two month , individual switch treatment strategy . Measurements At baseline , two month ( +14 day ) four month ( +14 day ) , clinical assessment , medical history , current medication therapy , fast blood sample , maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test , pulmonary function three complete questionnaire ( HeartQol , IPAQ EQ-5D ) collect patient . A fourth questionnaire complete patient , focus usability HeartHab-application . Statistical analysis Data analysis perform use SPSS version 22 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL , USA ) accord intention-to-treat principle assign treatment group . Nonparametric alternative use parametric statistic case assumption latter violate . The Shapiro-Wilk test use assess normality . Paired test ( parametric ) Wilcoxon sign rank test ( nonparametric ) use within-group analysis ; independent test ( parametric ) Mann-Whitney U test ( nonparametric ) between-group analysis . Chi-square test use case categorical variable ; Fisher 's exact test use expected frequency small . The significance level test 2-sided α=.05 . The cost-effectiveness evaluation conduct society patient perspective , take account intervention health care resource cost . As majority patient retire , productivity loss due illness-related absence workplace take account . Health care cost aggregate cost hospital admission cardiovascular reason also specialist visit associate diagnostics . The cardiovascular rehospitalizations ' related cost derive invoice retrieve recruit hospital ' financial department . INAMI/RIZIV 's nomenclature-based tariff define specialist visit diagnostics denomination . Quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) use generic measure effectiveness . Estimates QALYs derive EQ-5D questionnaire . The EQ-5D score convert utility score . The utility estimate convert adjusted mean QALYs calculate area curve ( AUC ) utility estimate time interval patient , weight length follow-up time interval . The change baseline utility ( adjust differential incremental QALYs ) calculate , use multiple regression model control baseline utility difference . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) calculate ( ICER¼ ( Cost intervention group - Cost control group ) / ( Effectiveness intervention group - Effectiveness control group ) ) compare cost outcomes ( effectiveness ) across treatment group . The incremental cost determine difference total average cost per patient intervention group control group . The incremental effectiveness estimate adjusted differential incremental QALYs .</detailed_description>
