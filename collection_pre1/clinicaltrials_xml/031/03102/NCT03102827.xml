	<brief_title>High-Flow-Therapy Treatment Cheyne-Stokes-Respiration Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In chronic heart failure ( CHF ) patient sleep disordered breathing mainly comprise two different entity : obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) central sleep apnea Cheyne-Stokes respiration ( CSA ) . Being rare disease general population , CSA find prevalence 40 % CHF patients.1 This rise prevalence instigate pathophysiological overlap . CSA precipitate hyperventilation highly sensitive hypocapnea-induced apneic threshold , whereby apnea initiate small transient reduction partial pressure carbon dioxide ( pCO2 ) . Underlying mechanism fully understood , yet . Despite neurohumoral derangement alter chemoreflex cascade ( enhance `` loop gain '' `` controller gain '' ) circulatory delay , pulmonary congestion think play role evolution CSA . Caused reduced cardiac output and/or impaired leave ventricular filling pattern , rise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) result interstitial pulmonary edema closely correlated occurrence CSA . Furthermore , acute increase pulmonary congestion overnight rostral fluid displacement lung find low sleep pCO2 predispose CSA . Furthermore , decrease blood oxygen tension stimulate discharge peripheral chemoreceptor give rise hyperventilation pattern CSA . Conversely , hyperventilation increase propensity central apnea reduce CO2-reserve . Underlining importance hypoxemic chemoreceptor stimulation development CSA , previous study exemplify pathophysiological key element patient pulmonary artery hypertension , hypocapnia , periodic breathe CSA highly prevalent despite normal capillary wedge pressure value . Also heart failure patient seem important : several interventional study show least partial suppression CSR use oxygen therapy . High flow therapy technique provide range flow heat , humidify air patient require respiratory support , deliver nasal cannula range The high flow ventilation therapy air/oxygen mixture rate 20-50 L/min via nasal cannula able provide adequate oxygen flow rate completely avoid hypoxemias . An increase oxygen saturation associate reduced chemosensitivity glomus caroticum . This may help improve Cheyne-Stokes respiration severity . Previous study could reach reduction 50 % AHI use 2 L/min oxygen . At time high flow ventilation therapy attenuate inspiratory resistance potentially deliver positive distending pressure lung recruitment without provide excessive intrathoracic pressure ( 3-6 cm H2O , accord manufacturer ) . But hand hyperoxemic state also find unfavorable consequence increase infarct size myocardial infarction therefore avoid . The FLOAT-CS study proof-of-concept study investigate nocturnal high flow ventilation therapy oxygen ( oxygen-HFT ) novel therapeutic approach HFrEF patient CSA attenuation hypoxemic burden . The high flow ventilation therapy via nasal cannula 20-50 L/min mixture ambient air oxygen titrate achieve target oxygen flow lead normoxemia define transcutaneous oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) 91 % 98 % . This expect completely avoid hypoxemias without provide excessive intrathoracic pressure . For great possible comfort patient humidifier used mixture air oxygen warm 37°C . In addition , FLOAT-CS study investigate hemodynamic effect oxygen-HFT versus placebo . Thus patient participate study randomize 1:1 manner therapy oxygen-HFT either first second study night , respectively . During night treat placebo . Since main focus investigation treatment CSA patient undergo fully-attended , in-hospital polysomnography ass parameter related sleep cardiorespiratory event sleep All subject receive arterial access Arteria radialis remain throughout study participation . This allow continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring frequent arterial blood gas analysis thus ensure maximum patient safety well precise detailed record .</detailed_description>
