	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase II study approximately 36 patient randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive either ARGX-113 Dose A , ARGX-113 Dose B body weight placebo 4 infusion administer 1-week apart addition Standard-of-Care ( SoC ) treatment . Patients age 18 85 year ( inclusive ) confirm primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) platelet count ˂ 30 × 109/L receive oral corticosteroid and/or permit oral immunosuppressant and/or Thrombopoietin receptor ( TPO-R ) agonist SoC must maintain stable dose frequency least 4 week prior Screening . The study include 2-week Screening , 3-week Treatment period , 8-week follow-up ( FU ) period . Patients may receive rescue therapy study discretion investigator deem medically necessary .</detailed_description>
