	<brief_title>A Study Healthy Volunteers Erectile Dysfunction Patients With Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several oral medication contain PDE5 inhibitor , include sildenafil ( Viagra® , Pfizer ) , vardenafil ( Levitra® , Bayer ) tadalafil ( Cialis® , Lilly ) , market treatment ED . Many consideration take patient prescribed PDE5 inhibitor medication , may cause systemic side effect take nitrate alpha-blocker . The active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) TR399 5 % Vardenafil HCl·3H2O . Non-clinical study show topical use TR399 enhance erection sexual behavior animal model without cause irritancy phototoxicity . This study design single-arm open-label fashion order explore safety PK TR399 healthy volunteer , well safety , PK efficacy TR399 patient ED .</detailed_description>
