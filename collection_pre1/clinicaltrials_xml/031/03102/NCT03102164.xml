	<brief_summary>The study include 30 consecutive patient acute heart failure ( AHF ) . In 20 patient investigator perform cardiologic rehabilitation . In remain 10 patient standard pharmacotherapy administer . The cardiologic rehabilitation follow protocol use routinely patient AHF admit Centre Heart Disease , Military Hospital Wroclaw . This protocol include gradually increase level physical exercise ( e.g . : respiratory exercise , assist , active dynamic , relaxation exercise , well short-term isometric exercise general exercise low intensity , short duration properly adjust recovery phase ) . The following test conduct first last day hospitalization 30 day follow discharge : clinical evaluation ( medical interview , routine physical examination , echocardiography , assessment natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) , basic laboratory test special emphasis inflammatory marker renal liver parameter ) ; hemodynamic evaluation ( i.e . non-invasive evaluation cardiac output systemic vascular resistance use impedance cardiography ) ; evaluation biomarkers reflect myocyte-damage ( i.e . immunochemical measure tissue-specific enzymatic isoforms , enable distinguish marker skeletal muscle damage vs. marker myocardial injury - e.g . creatine kinase CK , muscular isozyme CKMM , lactate dehydrogenase 5 LDH5 , myoglobin , carbonic anhydrase III , determine use test base ELISA ) . On first day hospitalization , well first , third last day rehabilitation ( latter term correspond last day hospitalization well ) also 30 day discharge , follow test perform ( time : rest post-exercise ) : hemodynamic evaluation , evaluation skeletal muscle function ( use surface electromyography ( sEMG ) ; maximum tonus muscle determine along level muscular fatigability change time ; evaluation muscle tissue perfusion ( assessed basis oxygenation level , non-invasive , direct continuous record perfusion peripheral tissue local tissue oximetry , measure near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . NIRS base absorption near-infrared wave oxygenate reduced haemoglobin . The level absorption reflect degree tissue oxygenation give area microcirculation . Furthermore , capillary gasometry ( oxygen saturation lactate concentration ) determine ) . Moreover , two functional test perform discharge 30 day discharge : 6-minute walk test 30-second `` chair stand '' test examine strength endurance low extremity ( pertain repeat get chair period 30 second ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>T1 . Objective hypotheses Acute heart failure ( AHF ) associate disorder peripheral perfusion , lead injury many vital organ . Consequently , episode AHF form multiple organ failure potential injury dysfunction skeletal muscle ; however , latter issue address literature thus far . The aim project comprehensively evaluate skeletal muscle ( functional tissue level ) acute heart failure . The following hypothesis verify : ( 1 ) Impaired perfusion muscle reflect injury significant functional abnormality ; ( 2 ) Early implement motor rehabilitation improve perfusion function skeletal muscle ; This study demonstrate skeletal muscle involve component AHF-related multiple organ failure . Moreover , study involve analysis effect physical exercise session hemodynamic parameter patient AHF ( cardiac output , stroke volume , arterial blood pressure , systemic vascular resistance ) ; question address thus far . Method The study include 30 consecutive patient AHF ( result decompensation chronic systolic HF ) . In case 20 patient therapeutic process include cardiologic rehabilitation , standard pharmacotherapy administer another 10 patient . The cardiologic rehabilitation follow protocol patient AHF use routinely Center Heart Disease , Military Clinical Hospital Polyclinic Wroclaw . The protocol include gradually increase level physical exercise : respiratory , assist , active dynamic , relaxation exercise , well short-term isometric exercise general strength exercise low intensity , short duration properly adjust recovery phase . The following test conduct first last day hospitalization 30 day follow discharge : Clinical evaluation - history taking , routine physical examination , echocardiography , determination natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) , basic laboratory test special emphasis inflammatory marker renal liver parameter . Hemodynamic evaluation - non-invasive determination cardiac output systemic vascular resistance mean impedance cardiography . Evaluation myocyte injury marker - immunochemical measurement tissue-specific enzymatic isoforms take order distinguish marker skeletal muscle myocardial injury . The biomarkers muscular injury ( e.g . creatine kinase CK , muscular isozyme CKMM , lactate dehydrogenase 5 LDH5 , myoglobin , carbonic anhydrase III ) determine serum mean ELISA . Moreover , follow test conduct rest post-exercise first day hospitalization , well first , third last day rehabilitation ( latter term correspond last day hospitalization well ) 30 day discharge : Evaluation skeletal muscle function conduct mean surface electromyography ( sEMG ) . Maximum tonus muscle determine along level muscular fatigability change time . Moreover , two functional test conduct discharge hospital 30 day thereafter : 6-minute walk test 30-second `` chair stand '' test examine strength endurance low body ( pertain repeat get chair period 30 second ) . Evaluation muscle tissue perfusion ( examine indirectly basis oxygenation level ) conduct non-invasively direct continuous record perfusion peripheral tissue local tissue oximetry , so-called near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . NIRS base absorption near-infrared wave oxygenate reduced hemoglobin . The level absorption reflect degree tissue oxygenation give area microcirculation . Furthermore , capillary gasometry ( oxygen saturation lactate concentration ) determine</detailed_description>
