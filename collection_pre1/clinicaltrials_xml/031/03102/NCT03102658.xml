	<brief_summary>Because micafungin generally well tolerated appear limited interaction drug , potential important agent treatment invasive fungal infection . Although micafungin approve treatment invasive candidiasis , dose guideline micafungin ( morbidly ) obese patient available . Subsequently , pharmacokinetic profile micafungin ( well echinocandins ) specific patient population still largely unknown . To build valid pharmacokinetic model , obese patient BMI ≥ 40 undergoing endoscopic gastric bypass surgery receive single dose 100 mg 200mg micafungin ( besides standard anti-bacterial prophylaxis ) sample pharmacokinetic curve take . These PK-values compare PK normal-weight group receive 100mg micafungin</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obese patient BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 undergo endoscopic gastric bypass surgery receive 100 mg 200mg dose micafungin . A PK curve determine administration t=0.5 , 0.95 , 1.25 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , ( feasible ) 48 hour post infusion . Blood sample ( 4 mL ) PK day take obtain least 2.0 mL plasma .</detailed_description>
