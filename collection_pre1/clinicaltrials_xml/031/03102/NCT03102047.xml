	<brief_summary>This study do look safety response investigational drug durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) follow chemo-radiation therapy patient MSS stage II IV rectal cancer . Durvalumab recognize specific protein surface cancer cell trigger immune system destroy cancer cell . The chemoRT portion treatment complete course durvalumab initiate . In order learn certain characteristic rectal cancer tumor , study include special research test use sample diagnostic tumor , tissue sample tumor remove surgery , fresh tumor sample area cancer recur , blood sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) After Chemo-Radiation Microsatellite Stable Stage II-IV Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FR-2 study design phase II , open label , single arm study patient microsatellite stable ( MSS ) stag II-IV rectal cancer , assess activity PD-L1 inhibition durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) monotherapy standard chemo-radiotherapy ( chemoRT ) . The study 's primary aim determine safety efficacy durvalumab immediately follow chemoRT patient undergoing subsequent surgery stage II-IV rectal cancer . One dose durvalumab give every 2 week four total dos begin within 3-7 day complete chemoRT . Surgery patient must occur within 8−12 week final dose RT . Adjuvant chemotherapy surgical recovery discretion treat physician . During safety run-in , first 6 patient closely follow 30 day last dose durvalumab without accrual patient . Patients receive durvalumab ( 750mg IV infusion every 2 week ) 4 total dos . No concurrent anti-neoplastic medication treatment aside standard supportive care allow durvalumab treatment phase . The safety run-in portion study proceed full enrollment propose study therapy dose , ( 750 mg IV infusion every 2 week ) , one less dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) significant safety concern attributable durvalumab identify observation period first 6 patient . If two DLTs , accrual study stop reassessment protocol . A total 47 patient enrol study sample size 41 surgically evaluable patient . Required tissue blood sample collect specific time point submit correlative science study . Optional tumor blood sample collect consent patient upon disease recurrence progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The ECOG performance status must 0 1 Patients biopsyproven adenocarcinoma , stage II IV rectal cancer . The tumor must determine mismatch repair proficient microsatellite stable CLIA approve test ( Immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] , polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] , NextGeneration Sequencing [ NGS ] assay ) . Patients must candidate plan surgical resection primary rectal cancer 8 12 week completion neoadjuvant chemoRT , even stage IV . Planned neoadjuvant chemoRT treatment must conform NCCN guideline . Baseline stag prior treatment initiation must obtain . If stage IV , must documentation PET/CT scan , CT scan , MRI , patient evidence measurable distant disease per RECIST 1.1 . Note : Patients stage IV disease limit measurable metastatic disease ( one two organ involve e.g. , liver lung ) primary tumor deem resectable . Blood count perform within 4 week prior study entry must meet following criterion : ANC must great equal 1500/mm3 Platelet count must great equal 75,000/mm3 ; Hemoglobin must great equal 9 g/dL . Adequate hepatic function perform within 4 week prior study entry must meet : Total bilirubin must less equal 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) lab unless patient bilirubin elevation great 1.5 x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) 3 x ULN due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ; AST ALT must less equal 2.5 x ULN lab follow exception : patient document liver metastasis , AST ALT must less equal 5 x ULN . Adequate renal function within 4 week study entry , define serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x ULN lab . ( If creatinine 1.01.5 x ULN , creatinine clearance great 40 mL/min per CockcroftGault formula ( CockcroftGault 1976 ) , 24hour urine collection determination creatinine clearance . ) Patients reproductive potential ( male/female ) must agree use accept highly effective method contraception receive durvalumab , least 3 month last dose durvalumab . Female patient must either nonreproductive potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal history : great equal 60 year old menses great equal 1 year without alternative medical cause ; OR history hysterectomy , OR history bilateral tubal ligation , OR history bilateral oophorectomy ) must negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry . Diagnosis anal small bowel carcinoma . Histopathology adenocarcinoma , e.g. , sarcoma , lymphoma , carcinoid . Previous therapy PD1 PDL1 inhibitor ( include durvalumab ) malignancy . Completion pelvic radiotherapy treatment current rectal cancer prior pelvic radiotherapy ( e.g. , prior prostate cervical cancer therapy ) . Receipt live attenuate vaccination within 30 day prior study entry within 30 day receive last dose durvalumab . Acute chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C. Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiencyrelated ( AIDS ) illnesses . History brain metastasis , uncontrolled spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , new evidence brain leptomeningeal disease . Active infection chronic infection require chronic suppressive antibiotic . History allogeneic organ transplantation . Active prior document inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) . Active prior history autoimmune inflammatory condition require ongoing immunosuppressive medication . This specifically include use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose durvalumab exception intranasal corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10mg/day prednisone equivalent corticosteroid . Any following cardiac condition : Documented NYHA Class III IV congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry Unstable angina within 6 month prior study entry Symptomatic arrhythmia Prolonged QTc great equal 470 m . If QTc great equal 470ms , confirmation eligible QTc require mean calculation 2 additional electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) 2−5 minute apart use Fridericia 's Correction Formula ( mean less 470 m ) . Uncontrolled high blood pressure define systolic BP great equal 150 mmHg diastolic BP great equal 100 mmHg without antihypertensive medication . Patients initial BP elevation eligible initiation adjustment BP medication lower pressure meet entry criterion . Ongoing active gastritis peptic ulcer disease . Active bleeding diatheses opinion treat physician pose significantly increase operative risk . Known history previous diagnosis tuberculosis . History hypersensitivity durvalumab excipient . Known history active pneumonia , pneumonitis , symptomatic interstitial lung disease , definitive evidence interstitial lung disease describe CT scan , MRI , chest xray asymptomatic patient ; dyspnea rest require current continuous oxygen therapy . Other malignancy unless patient consider diseasefree complete therapy malignancy great equal 12 month prior study entry . Patients follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 12 month : carcinoma situ cervix , colorectal carcinoma situ , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement , interfere interpretation study result . Pregnancy lactation time study entry . ( Note : Pregnancy test perform within 14 day prior study entry accord institutional standard woman childbearing potential . ) Use investigational agent within 4 week prior study entry .</criteria>
