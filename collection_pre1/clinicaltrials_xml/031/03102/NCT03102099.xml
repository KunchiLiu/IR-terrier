	<brief_title>Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound-guided Fine-needle Aspiration Biopsy Evaluation Thyroid Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid nodule thyroid cancer common frequently occur disease China ; Relevant research reveal increase incidence thyroid cancer prominent China overseas , incidence thyroid cancer urban resident Beijing increase 1.55/100,000 1995 9.9/100,000 2010 ( 5.38 fold ) . The rapid development image technique include ultrasound , CT MRI substantially increase accuracy diagnosis thyroid nodule , however accuracy still 100 % aspiration biopsy require . Therefore , ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy play critical role diagnosis pathological lesion . Many guideline deem fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy accurate cost-effective examination method evaluation thyroid nodule help reduce unnecessary thyroid nodule surgery also help clinician determine appropriate surgical treatment plan [ 1-4 ] . However accord literature report , sample insufficient quantity cell occur 10-15 % case , sometimes second biopsy diagnostic operation need perform [ 1,4 ] .False negative result FNA biopsy mismatch ultrasound diagnosis clinical diagnosis occur due number reason tumor big small , poor location , presence degenerative necrosis , inappropriate position biopsy affect operator 's experience etc . Contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) new technology recently introduce China , ability display microvascular perfusion tissue low mechanical index . The serial real-time image obtain digitalize dynamically store . And allow retrospective analysis also enable comparison make image technique . CEUS sensitively reflect characteristic blood supply microcirculation site lesion . Although CEUS-guided FNA thyroid nodule yet report , large number study report liver biopsy perform guidance CEUS . Its efficacy obtain accurate diagnosis reduce number biopsy clear sample take area rich blood supply . Metabolic-active area within malignant tumor , area degeneration necrosis also detection small tumor confirm use CEUS . Aspiration biopsy perform guidance CEUS expect yield decrease non-diagnostic result . The investigator intent create randomize controlled study investigate application value CEUS diagnosis space-occupying lesion thyroid use FNA . Data collection Collect sort general data patient , record conventional US finding contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( group CEUS ) find two group , also result aspiration biopsy pathology , fill case report form ( CRF ) , establish database . Carry analysis use specialized statistical software . Four parameter efficacy ( inadequacy , indeterminacy , malignancy , benign ) rate ) evaluate series thyroid FNA compare two group . The inadequacy rate refers proportion case non-diagnostic result . The indeterminate rate refers proportion case atypia undetermined significance/follicular lesion undetermined significance ( AUS FLUS ) category . The malignancy rate refers proportion case malignant . The benign rate refers proportion case benign . The number obtain cell specimens diagnostic result classify two class accord cytopathologist 's experience : intermediate ( diagnose possible ) , abundant ( diagnose easily ) . The comparison cell amount two group secondary aim . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis carry use SPSS 22.0 , statistical data analyze use Chi square test . Differences consider statistically significant p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
