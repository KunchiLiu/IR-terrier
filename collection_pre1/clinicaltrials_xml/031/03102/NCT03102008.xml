	<detailed_description>The goal study examine core dysfunction transdiagnostic psychotherapy emotional disorder youth influence change cross-cutting feature theoretically link neuroticism also target treatment . Another goal investigate change symptoms emotional disorder , include anxiety depression , throughout course treatment , Unified Protocol Treatment Emotional Disorders Adolescents ( UP-A ) . My long-term goal identify way personalize effective psychotherapy model array youth emotional disorder determine implementation different component UP-A influence change mental health . My research objective study use group-level novel single case analytic strategy identify change emotional disorder implementation UP-A , transdiagnostic form cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) adolescent . Specifically , I interest examine feature core dysfunction target UP-A , high neuroticism well symptoms emotional disorder change throughout UP-A treatment . My central hypothesis adolescent emotional disorder display change measure core dysfunction reduction symptoms emotional disorder throughout UP-A treatment . Aim 1 : Investigate relationship use UP-A treatment component change measure neuroticism , core dysfunction cut across emotional disorder . The main working hypothesis administration UP-A result observable change measure cross-cutting feature emotional disorder link neuroticism ( cognitive flexibility , distress tolerance , experiential avoidance ) . Such change occur introduction relevant core principle UP-A . The propose study design determine whether change aspect neuroticism emotional disorder symptom occur directly follow presentation treatment component , whether change might instead stagger throughout treatment . Aim 2 : Investigate reduction symptoms emotional disorder ( i.e. , symptom anxiety depression , severity present problem ) occur throughout treatment . Based knowledge obtain previous randomize , control trial ( RCTs ) focus treatment anxiety , depressive related disorder , main work hypothesis Aim 2 severity emotional disorder symptom decrease pre- post-treatment . Exploratory Aim 3 : Investigate aspect neuroticism potential mechanism change emotional disorder symptom . The primary working hypothesis Aim 3 change feature neuroticism target UP-A precede change anxiety depressive symptom . RESEARCH STRATEGY A . SIGNIFICANCE Anxiety , depression , related emotional disorder prevalent impair . They high level symptom overlap also share underlying temperament factor , include high neuroticism low extroversion . The UP-A similar core dysfunction-focused transdiagnostic therapy approach may lead successful treatment target feature cut across emotional disorder . B . INNOVATION Several study UP-A indicate significant improvement anxiety depression pre- post-treatment . Research focus recently shift effort figure core-dysfunction treatment work . One step direction determine whether cross-cutting feature define internalize disorder ( i.e. , neuroticism related construct ) might serve mechanisms treatment-based change disorder symptom severity . One case study use adult UP treatment find change cross-cutting feature , include mindfulness cognitive reappraisal , change prior reduction anxiety depression . Within child literature , downward adaptation UP-A ( compare anxiety-focused CBT program ) demonstrate great decrease several cross-cutting feature emotional disorder , include sadness dysregulation reappraisal , course treatment . However , study thus far investigated change process cross-cutting feature emotional disorder , treatment UP-A . The present study advance understanding implementation UP-A might lead change direct cognitive behavioral target well symptom emotional disorder adolescent . An increased understanding , UP-A work vital personalize psychotherapy maximize efficiency uptake future dissemination implementation research . Another innovation investigation novel application single-case research design methodology model technique analysis time-sequence data . Although mechanisms change may investigate via large-scale RCTs clinical intervention , time , cost labor trial impede rapid dissemination effort . This innovative single-case methodology allow clinical researcher vet potential mechanism change quickly use future research . C. APPROACH Research Design Methods Overview . A non-concurrent multiple baseline design use . This type design include series A-B replication along randomly assign baseline period ( 2 , 3 , 4 week study ; 3 participant per baseline condition ) . Repeated measure ( adolescent- parent-report change cross-cutting feature emotional disorder disorder-specific symptom ) give weekly throughout treatment comprehensive assessment ( adolescent- parent-report well clinician-rated clinical severity diagnostic impression ) occur pre- post-treatment time point . The specific combination analysis use ( nonparametric group-level comparison ass change major time point [ pre- , mid- , post-treatment ] well Simulation Modeling Analysis [ SMA ] ass change time individual ) require measure administer variety time point ( i.e. , pre- post- treatment , pre- , mid- , post-treatment ; weekly , respectively ) . Thus , change time weekly measure examine pre- , mid- , post-treatment group level , change time weekly measure examine use weekly data ( baseline , treatment repeat measure ) individual subject level . Further , change time clinical interview data assess pre- post-treatment . Participants . A minimum nine clinically anxious and/or depress adolescent age 13 17 recruit via university clinic , least three adolescent randomize baseline condition . Intervention . Unified Protocol Treatment Emotional Disorders Adolescents ( UP-A ) . Adolescents complete 16 session Unified Protocol Treatment Emotional Disorders Adolescents fix order . The UP-A compose 8 core module , include Orienting Treatment Enhancing Motivation , Emotion Education , Introduction Emotion-focused Behavioral Experiments , Awareness Physical Sensations , Being Flexible Your Thinking , Emotional Awareness , Situation-Based Emotion Exposures , Relapse Prevention . Analytic Plan Data analyze use specific combination analysis support single case research design clinical replication literature . Initial approach utilize data weekly measure , plus administered pre-treatment , post-baseline , mid-treatment , post-treatment time point . A second group analysis , used measure change time variables interest throughout treatment well potential mechanism treatment change , include application Parker Hagan-Burke 's ( 2007 ) clinical outcome approach , establish specifically analysis single-case data well Simulation Modeling Analyses ( SMA ; [ 1-3 , 30 ] ) , identify change cross-cutting feature emotional disorder symptom course implementation UP-A .</detailed_description>
