	<brief_summary>The suggested clinical trial part KidsAP project fund European Commission 's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme . The project evaluate use Artificial Pancreas ( closed loop system ) young child type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) age 1 7 year . The suggested trial feasibility study pilot setup large-scale outcome trial address specific need population . The result pilot trial feed design outcome study . In study investigator compare closed loop insulin delivery use standard strength insulin close loop use dilute insulin young child T1D . Diluted insulin standard treatment approach child low insulin requirement . The investigator hypothesize dilute insulin lead stable glucose level reduce inaccuracy accentuate delivery minute amount insulin ( frequently less 0.1U/h [ 1μl/h standard strength insulin ] small child compare 1U/h adult ) . These inaccuracy may result pump plunger micro-jumps , tissue pressure build-up , infusion set kinking . This study build previous on-going study close loop system perform Cambridge child adolescent T1D clinical research facility home setting . The study adopt open-label , multi-centre , multinational , randomised , two-period crossover design contrast close loop glucose control use dilute insulin close loop use standard insulin strength free-living home condition . The two intervention period last 3 week 1 4 week washout period . The order two intervention random . A total 30 young child age 1 7 year T1D insulin pump therapy recruit outpatient diabetes clinic participate clinical centre allow 24 complete subject available assessment study arm . Prior use study device , participant parents/guardians receive appropriate training research team safe use study pump continuous glucose monitoring system , hybrid close loop insulin delivery system . Carers nursery school may also receive training study team require . During intervention period , subject parents/guardians use close loop system 21 day free-living condition home nursery/school environment without remote monitoring supervision research staff . The primary outcome time spend target range 3.9 10.0 mmol/l record CGM . Secondary outcomes time spend glucose level target , record CGM , CGM-based metric . Safety evaluation comprise tabulation severe hypoglycaemic episode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Artificial Pancreas Very Young Children With T1D - Pilot ( KidsAP01 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose clinical trial : This feasibility study pilot outcome study setup address specific need studied population compare close loop insulin delivery use standard strength insulin ( U-100 ) dilute insulin . The result fee design follow outcome study . The investigator hypothesize dilute insulin lead stable glucose level reduce inaccuracy accentuate delivery small amount insulin ( frequently less 0.1U/h [ 1μl/h standard strength insulin ] small child . Study objectives : The study objective evaluate safety , efficacy utility day-and-night close loop glucose control young child type 1 diabetes . 1 . EFFICACY : The objective ass ability day-and-night hybrid close loop system use dilute insulin maintain CGM glucose level within target range 3.9 10mmol/l ( 70 180mg/dl ) comparison hybrid close loop system standard insulin strength young child type 1 diabetes . 2 . SAFETY : The objective evaluate safety day-and-night close loop use diluted insulin versus close loop non-diluted insulin term episodes severity hypoglycaemia , nature severity adverse event . 3 . UTILITY : The objective determine overall acceptability duration use close loop system population . Study Design : The pilot study adopt open-label , multi-centre , multinational , randomised , two-period crossover study design contrast close loop glucose control use dilute insulin close loop use standard insulin strength young child type 1 diabetes home setting . Two intervention period last 3 week 1 4 week washout period . The order two intervention random . Participating clinical centre : 1 . Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust , Cambridge , UK 2 . Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust , Leeds , UK 3 . University Luxembourg , Luxembourg 4 . University Leipzig , Leipzig , Germany 5 . Medical University Graz , Graz , Austria 6 . Medical University Innsbruck , Innsbruck , Austria 7 . Medical University Vienna , Vienna , Austria Sample Size : 24 participant randomise ( 2-5 participant per centre ) , equal proportion total daily insulin dose ≤12 U/day &gt; 12 U/day Maximum duration study subject : 14 week Recruitment : The subject recruit paediatric diabetes outpatient clinic participate clinical centre ( see ) . Enrollment target 30 ( 2-5 participant per centre ) allow dropout run-in ( approximately equal proportion total daily insulin dose ≤12 U/day &gt; 12 U/day ) . Consent : Written inform consent obtain parents/guardians write assent old child study related activity . Baseline Assessment : Eligible subject undergo baseline evaluation include blood sample measurement HbA1c . Questionnaires complete parents/guardians . Pre-Study Training Run-in : Training session use study CGM insulin pump provide research team . During 2-4 week run-in period , subject use study CGM insulin pump . For compliance ass ability subject use study device safely , least 8 day CGM data need record safe use study insulin pump demonstrate last 14 day run-in period . The CGM data also use assess baseline glucose control may use treatment optimization necessary . Competency Assessment : Competency use study insulin pump study CGM evaluate use competency assessment tool develop research team . Training may repeat require . Randomisation : Eligible subject randomise use automate hybrid close loop glucose system dilute insulin close loop standard strength insulin 21 day , 1-4 week washout period two intervention . 1 . Closed loop dilute insulin Training use close loop system dilute insulin provide research team . During 2-4 hour session , subject parents/guardians operate system supervision clinical research team , practicality around use dilute insulin discuss , pump setting adjust accordingly . Competency use close loop system evaluate . Thereafter , subject parents/guardians continue use hybrid close loop system dilute insulin 21 day home . 2 . Closed loop standard insulin strength : Identical procedure describe follow include training use close loop system standard strength insulin . Subjects continue use close loop system standard strength insulin home 21 day . End study assessment : Study device download return . Participants resume usual care use pre-study insulin pump . A closed loop experience questionnaire complete parents/guardians . Procedures safety monitor trial : Standard operate procedure monitor report adverse event place , include serious adverse event ( SAE ) specific adverse event ( AE ) severe hypoglycaemia . Criteria withdrawal subject safety ground : A subject/guardian may terminate participation study time without necessarily give reason without personal disadvantage . An investigator stop participation subject consideration benefit/risk ratio . Possible reason : - Serious adverse event - Non-compliance - Serious protocol violation - Decision investigator , sponsor , termination subject 's best medical interest</detailed_description>
