	<brief_summary>For number reason woman major depressive disorder often discontinue conventional antidepressant become pregnant prefer take depressive illness develop course pregnancy . There considerable evidence administration omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , monotherapy antidepressant effect . If could clearly establish effective approach would offer valuable alternative woman risk , develop , depressive disorder pregnancy . Strongly positive placebo-controlled trial EPA supplementation , though , co-exist entirely negative one . No clear reason discrepancy emerge one possibility sample study differed proportion individual likely benefit EPA supplementation . As effort identify individual propose explore two group measure , relevant EPA 's likely mechanisms action , potential tool identify individual likely benefit treatment . Hypothesis : Among woman experience major depressive episode first two trimester pregnancy , baseline measure cytokine activity erythrocyte PUFA concentration associate , additive interactive fashion , subsequent improvement depressive symptom among woman take omega-3 PUFA supplementation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project determine whether certain measure nutritional status immune function useful identification woman would benefit omega-3 supplement treatment depression pregnancy . Pregnancy reduce risk recurrence among woman previously experience depressive illness advent new episode pregnancy raise particular problem . Concerns possible teratogenicity medication general leave many woman reluctant continue preexist antidepressant prophylaxis accept new trial conventional antidepressant treatment accumulate evidence SSRIs short-term adverse effect newborn . The antidepressant effect omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) supplementation may offer particularly appropriate alternative conventional therapy depressive episode occur pregnancy . The nutritional need fetus increase likelihood omega-3 PUFA deficits mother access adequate omega-3 PUFAs fish intake limit due concern mercury level . Antidepressant trial omega-3 supplementation describe significant benefit placebo include one target pregnant woman yield large effect size . Other trial , however , fail show clear antidepressant effect meta-analyses yield explanation inconsistency . A clear possibility study positive result involve subject likely benefit omega-3 supplementation characteristic individual entirely unknown . Numerous case-control study associate depressive illness lower tissue concentration omega-3 PUFAs high ratios omega-6 omega-3 . Such measure may well identify individual likely show antidepressant effect supplementation . The likelihood omega-3 PUFAs exert antidepressant effect via modulation inflammatory cascade , extensive evidence high level cytokine characterize individual depressive disorder , indicate measure may help select likely benefit treatment omega-3 PUFAs . A group 60 woman begin pregnancy depressive episode develop episode first two trimester choose take conventional antidepressant therapy would use test PUFA tissue concentration inflammatory measure predictor response omega-3 supplementation monotherapy . Aim # 1 : To determine , among woman first- second-trimester major depressive episode , relationship subsequent response omega-3 PUFA supplementation baseline measure PUFA erythrocyte concentration cytokine activity . Hypothesis # 1 : Among woman experience major depressive episode first two trimester pregnancy , baseline measure cytokine activity erythrocyte PUFA concentration associate , additive interactive fashion , subsequent improvement depressive symptom among woman take omega-3 PUFA supplementation . Aim # 1 test whether measure PUFA tissue concentration cytokine activity potential value treatment selection woman experience depressive disorder pregnancy . The strength measure correlate symptom outcome use select use definitive placebo-controlled trial target sample enrich likely respond EPA supplementation.The measure emerge strongly risk factor new episode would use select subject participation placebo-controlled trial EPA supplementation prophylaxis depressive disorder recurrence . The result would integrate design acute treatment prophylaxis trial .</detailed_description>
