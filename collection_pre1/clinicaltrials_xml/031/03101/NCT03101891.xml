	<detailed_description>In fetal life , urine production kidney responsible sustain amniotic fluid uterus . This fluid critical fetal lung development gestation . Complete lack amniotic fluid , know anhydramnios , lead lethal pulmonary hypoplasia 100 % patient . A common cause complete anhydramnios congenital bilateral renal agenesis CoBRA . CoBRA relatively common complicate nearly 1 every 3000 pregnancy . CoBRA traditionally consider lethal condition affect fetus pulmonary hypoplasia addition require renal transplant sustain life . Several report suggest beneficial effect amnioinfusion lung development fetal state low amniotic fluid . Accordingly , restoration normal amniotic fluid volume amnioinfusion may improve pulmonary mortality patient CoBRA . In term neonatal renal failure , however , outlook significantly improve last decade . Large study demonstrate peritoneal dialysis renal transplant become highly successful strategy neonates little kidney function . Accordingly , need evaluate efficacy serial amnioinfusion produce life-sustaining pulmonary function specifically CoBRA patient . The aim study evaluate safety efficacy serial amnioinfusion reliably prevent pulmonary hypoplasia patient isolated CoBRA . It unknown serial amnioinfusions reliably prevent pulmonary hypoplasia set CoBRA . Similarly , know serial amnioinfusions give neonate enough pulmonary reserve candidate renal replacement therapy acceptable level morbidity . The investigator hypothesize serial amnioinfusions reliably prevent lethal pulmonary hypoplasia fetus diagnose CoBRA minimal maternal morbidity . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize great 50 % treated patient candidate peritoneal dialysis eventual transplant . This research critical importance determine efficacy renal agenesis fetal therapy ( RAFT ) provide guidance patient physicians deal CoBRA .</detailed_description>
