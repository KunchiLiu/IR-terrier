	<brief_summary>This unblinded cluster-randomized study evaluate effectiveness two strategy scripting/dispensing antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) retention , virologic suppression , cost compare standard care . The study conduct Malawi Zambia among approximately 8,200 HIV-1-infected adult ( 18 year old ) stable ART . Clusters randomize one three study arm : ( 1 ) standard care ( SOC ) ART script ( varies country , region , clinic , and/or provider ) , ( 2 ) three-month ART scripting , ( 3 ) six-month ART scripting . 30 cluster select study , 15 Malawi 15 Zambia , randomize study arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct among approximately 8,200 HIV-infected individual age 18 year older stable antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) 30 cluster Malawi Zambia . Individuals screen routine clinic visit enrol meet inclusion criterion . Enrolled individual receive standard care site exception ART dispense interval base assigned randomization . Outcomes assess 12 month , participant observational follow-up 36 month , annual re-assessment retention , virologic suppression , cost-effectiveness . There contact study participant period follow-up . Endpoints determine chart review primary endpoint reach ( 12 month ) re-assessed 24-month endpoint 36-month endpoint . Endpoint data collection include : 1 . Retention care strategy 2 . Suppressed viral load &lt; 1,000 copy do part standard care viral load monitoring In subset participant Malawi ( n=1,500 ) , perform review participant ' health passport , record patient clinic visit , general health information , medication possess patient Malawi , 12- , 24- , 36-month endpoint complete . Data collect interim clinic visit , reason visit/services receive ( sick , family planning , non-communicable disease treatment ) , frequency visit , location clinic service . In subset participant ( ~240 ) , perform post intervention study visit 12-month endpoint complete also 36-month endpoint complete . Qualitative interview perform subset participant focus patient experience assign dispense interval , include challenges/barriers facilitator towards adherence retention . Focused question around endpoint ( default , reason ; virologic failure , reason include adherence ) also address post-intervention visit .</detailed_description>
