	<brief_title>Study Live Attenuated Chikungunya Vaccine Previously Epidemic Area</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical study conduct IND assess safety MV-CHIK previously epidemic area ( Puerto Rico ) . A total 100 healthy volunteer , 50 seropositive Chikungunya baseline 50 seronegative , randomize 4:1 ratio receive either MV-CHIK commercially available MMR vaccine double blinded fashion . Memory aid , complete volunteer home , investigator schedule follow-up visit , solicit symptom injection site reaction , fever , headache , malaise , joint muscle pain . Acute phase reactant ( C-reactive protein ferritin ) check routinely throughout study discretion investigator order help determine symptom , particularly referred joint , immunological basis . This study also evaluate immune response Chikungunya-exposed versus unexposed individual compare neutralize antibody titer specific time point . Measles viremia also measure compare MV-CHIK MMR recipient , three day second versus first dose . The relationship measles viremia immune response MV-CHIK explore .</detailed_description>
