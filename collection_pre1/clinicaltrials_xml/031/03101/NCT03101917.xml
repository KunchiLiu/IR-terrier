	<brief_summary>The Microtable® Microstereotactic Frame Drill Press Associated Method Cochlear Implantation consist patient-customized microstereotactic frame target cochlea . The intend use device early feasibility study surgically access cochlea , allow placement intra-cochlear electrode array cochlear implantation , thereby provide less invasive surgical option currently perform . Compared traditional cochlear implantation ( CI ) surgery , investigator hypothesize minimally invasive , image-guided approach may offer follow benefit : ( 1 ) short procedure time include short general anesthesia time , ( 2 ) less tissue removal potentially eliminate post-operative mastoid bone depression , decrease post-operative patient discomfort , quicker wound healing , ( 3 ) good chance preservation taste secondary preservation chorda tympani nerve , ( 4 ) standardization electrode placement potentially allow consistent placement within scala tympani sub-compartment cochlea show associated improve post-operative audiological performance . This early feasibility study focus advantage new technology patient . Advantages healthcare delivery system examine pivotal study phase .</brief_summary>

This early feasibility study focus advantage new technology patient . Advantages healthcare delivery system examine pivotal study phase . The investigator propose early feasibility study determine minimally invasive image-guided drilling surgically access cochlea CI successfully perform . The study involve unilateral CI . If participant schedule routine bilateral CI , traditional approach use one side investigational approach . Traditional surgery perform better-hearing ear , investigational technique perform poor hearing ear . To minimize patient variability , investigator study lateral wall electrode , Cochlear slim straight electrode MED-EL electrode . The investigator plan enroll 12 cochlear implant patient two group . Group 1 consist patient implanted direct visualization afford lift tympanomeatal flap , Group 2 consist patient implanted visualization afford pass endoscope across eardrum via myringotomy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female 22 80 year age . Able complete study related procedure . Able provide write informed consent . Eligible cochlear implant surgery per routine preoperative CI evaluation/workup . If patient candidate bilateral CI , research technique perform unilaterally side favorable anatomy and/or bad residual hearing . Preoperative CT scan head/temporal bone part routine care show normal temporal bone intracochlear anatomy . Scheduled receive either Cochlear CI522 slim straight electrode MEDEL Synchrony standard , Flex 24 , Flex 28 electrode . Females pregnant . As part routine preoperative care , females childbearing potential undergo either urine blood pregnancy test . ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologists ) Physical Status classification 4 determine surgeon great health risk . Previous mastoidectomy ear undergoing research procedure . Severe anatomical abnormality temporal bone include limited : 1 ) Mondini malformation 2 ) common cavity malformation 3 ) enlarge vestibular aqueduct ( EVA ) and/or 4 ) cochlea ossification . Severe chronic ear disease . Active middle ear infection . Subjects without favorable trajectory base preoperative imaging , analysis planning favorable trajectory define linear track extend surface mastoid cortex , facial recess , target basal turn cochlea without violation external auditory canal , sigmoid sinus , tegmen , and/or facial nerve .</criteria>
