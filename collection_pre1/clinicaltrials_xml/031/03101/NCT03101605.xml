	<brief_title>E-learning Trainees ' Ability Diagnose Treat Acute Otitis Media Among Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background aim : Acute Otitis Media ( AOM ) one common infection childhood lead cause antibiotic prescription . In previous study perform tertiary care pediatric emergency department , resident find low 52 % sensitivity 74 % specificity diagnosis AOM . Seeing opportunity substantial improvement , e-learning module AOM intend medical student design . The primary objective study measure impact e-learning module trainee ' ability appropriately diagnose AOM . The secondary objective assess prefer learning modality , evaluate e-learning module associate improved knowledge AOM good retention 3 week . Methods : This randomized trial perform single tertiary care pediatric emergency department . The participant third- fourth-year medical student general pediatrics rotation . The participant randomize complete e-learning module begin rotation receive 2-hour lecture topic AOM . The primary outcome ear examination accuracy measure shift emergency department . To measure , participant ask examine minimum five child risk AOM , define 12-60 month old age fever respiratory symptom . They question presence absence AOM examine ear . Attending physician control exams write diagnosis . The primary analysis difference diagnostic accuracy trainee complete E-learning module receive lecture . A sample size 80 medical student examine minimum five child would provide power 90 % alpha-value 0,05 demonstrate difference 15 % AOM diagnostic accuracy medical student complete E-learning module AOM compare receive standard lecture topic .</detailed_description>
