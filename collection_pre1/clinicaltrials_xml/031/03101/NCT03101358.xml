	<brief_title>Study Topical SOR007 Ointment Cutaneous Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2a , open-label , dose-rising study evaluate safety , tolerability preliminary efficacy three concentration SOR007 ( Uncoated Nanoparticle Paclitaxel ) Ointment ( 0.15 % , 1.0 % , 2.0 % ) apply non-ulcerated , non-melanoma cutaneous metastasis . A treatment area 50 cm2 select Investigator . Using gloved hand , subject apply one Finger Tip Unit ( FTU ) SOR007 50 cm2 treatment area twice daily approximately time day 28 day . At visit ( Days 1 , 8 , 16 , 28 , 42 ) , least two color photograph treatment area take ( ruler scale ) . All eligible lesion within treatment area measure use ImageJ photograph take visit . Eligible lesion determine baseline RECIST definition measurable tumor ( ≥ 10mm long diameter ) . The study include dose escalation phase dose expansion phase . In dose escalation phase , formal safety review conduct last subject cohort three subject complete 15 day treatment . The next dose level enroll upon find safety tolerability . The top dose maximum tolerate dose ( DLT occur ) take dose expansion phase additional subject enrol reach maximum 12 subject dose .</detailed_description>
