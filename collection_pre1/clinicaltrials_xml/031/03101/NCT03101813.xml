	<brief_summary>Doctors medical scientist want learn biology DIPG develop good way diagnose treat patient DIPG . To , need information characteristic DIPG tumor . Therefore , want establish central location clinical information tumor tissue collect DIPG patient . The purpose study : - To enroll patient diagnosed DIPG International DIPG Registry Repository . - To provide central location clinical information , scan , tissue sample patient DIPG enrol registry . - To collect tissue sample order study DIPG work molecular level . Researchers may use tissue sample study molecule protein DNA . Proteins need body function properly DNA molecule carry genetic information . Other researcher able use store sample future learn DIPG . The information researcher get research study keep registry along clinical information . - To help DIPG investigator around world work together make consistent diagnosis well design future research study . We hope lead good treatment DIPG future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma ( DIPG ) Registry Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There limit data regard biology diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) . This project provide infrastructure acquisition biological specimen , image , correlative clinical data facilitate biology study group patient . The goal DIPG registry promote collaboration amongst investigator allow timely data and/or specimen dissemination future research study develop classification system , uniform standard diagnosis , assessment response , ultimately lead development effective therapy child DIPG . This registry collect clinical , demographic , radiological pathological data specimen ( available ) patient DIPG , prospectively ( newly diagnose currently live patient ) , well retrospectively ( patient decease ) . Cases identify : 1 . Existing clinical and/or cancer registry databases 2 . Referrals clinician , surgeon , pathologists 3 . Families initiate contact Registry staff directly The following data/materials collect : Clinical : Demographic data , date diagnosis , sign symptom diagnosis , laboratory data , detailed treatment data ( e.g . type date surgery ( ) , chemotherapy , radiotherapy ) , best response treatment , date progression , type progression ( local metastatic ) , follow-up data . Imaging : All radiographic imaging obtain since diagnosis request time study entry . Pathology Central Review : If glass slide ( stain unstained ) paraffin block tumor tissue ( biopsy autopsy ) available , requested time registry entry mandatory enrollment . Bioinfomatics repository : Collection exist molecular and/or genomic data analysis perform well prospective analysis tissue registry submit central bioinformatics repository may link clinical data house DIPG registry . Tissue Collection Storage Future Research : If available , participant ' frozen tissue may submit banking future research . Data store Registry may use provide statistical data scientific presentation preparation peer-reviewed manuscript . No personal data trace study manuscript presentation . Data specimen release research proposal upon approval International DIPG Registry Committee . The International DIPG Registry Repository associate oncology group cooperative study treatment trial .</detailed_description>
