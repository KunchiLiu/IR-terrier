	<brief_summary>This research study study combination target therapy possible treatment advance melanoma find BRAF V600E BRAF V600K genetic mutation The intervention involve study : - LY3022855 - Vemurafenib - Cobimetinib</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LY3022855 With BRAF/MEK Inhibition Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II clinical trial . A Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve LY3022855 treatment disease . The FDA approve vemurafenib cobimetinib treatment option disease . LY3022855 colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor ( CSF-1R ) inhibitor . It human monoclonal antibody . A monoclonal antibody type protein make laboratory locate bind substance body , include tumor cell . By bind tumor cell , antibody might prevent tumor cell grow spread . LY3022855 develop treatment patient advance cancer . Vemurafenib cobimetinib attack different protein promote growth cancerous cell . Vemurafenib BRAF inhibitor work block alter BRAF proteins stimulate growth melanoma cancer cell . Cobimetinib work block protein call MEK known promote melanoma growth . In order participate study , participant 's disease need test positive mutation ( permanent change DNA sequence gene ) BRAF gene belongs class gene know oncogene . When mutate , oncogenes potential cause normal cell become cancerous . Once BRAF gene mutate , normal function BRAF protein may change . In research study , investigator combine LY3022855 vemurafenib cobimetinib hop LY3022855 enhance cancer respond vemurafenib cobimetinib .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For enrollment phase I portion : participant must histologically confirm melanoma BRAF V600E BRAF V600K mutation ( identify via NextGen sequence use DFCI/BWH OncoPanel CLIAcertified method ) metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist longer effective . For enrollment phase II portion : participant must histologically confirm melanoma BRAF V600E BRAF V600K mutation ( identify via NextGen sequence use DFCI/BWH OncoPanel CLIAcertified method ) receive prior BRAF MEK inhibitor therapy . Participants enrol phase I portion trial must evaluable measurable disease ( see Section 11 definition ) . Participants enrol phase II portion trial must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Age ≥ 18 year . As dose adverse event data currently available participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( see APPENDIX A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/uL Platelets ≥ 100 K/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN PTINR ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN ( participant anticoagulation therapy , ≤ 1.5 × baseline value ) aPTT ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN ( participant anticoagulation therapy , ≤ 1.5 × baseline value ) Participants must leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 50 % . Participants must QTc ≤ 470 msec screen EKG . The effect LY3022855 develop human fetus unknown . For reason anticancer agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion LY3022855 administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants must archival tumor tissue available . Participants without archival tissue may enrol discretion principal investigator . Participants chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapy , major surgery , another investigational agent within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study . Participants recover ≤ CTCAE grade 1 baseline toxicity result previous cancer treatment prior enter study ( exception alopecia peripheral neuropathy ≤ grade 2 ) . For enrollment phase II portion : participant receive prior BRAF MEK inhibitor therapy . Participants know untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Participants history brain metastasis treat , longer take corticosteroid , stable image ≥ 4 week follow last date treatment permit . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition LY3022855 , vemurafenib , cobimetinib . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study LY3022855 anticancer agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother LY3022855 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated LY3022855 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Participants known history HIV ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction LY3022855 , vemurafenib , cobimetinib antiretroviral agent . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Participants personal family history long QT syndrome . Participants history second primary malignancy . Exceptions include : patient history malignancy treat curatively recur within 3 year prior study entry ; resect basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , completely resect carcinoma situ type . Participants impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption vemurafenib cobimetinib opinion treat investigator ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Participants unable swallow retain oral medication . Participants require coadministration strong moderate CYP3A inhibitor , medication may alter vemurafenib cobimetinib concentration . Participants require treatment medication strong moderate CYP3A inducer , medication may alter concentration cobimetinib . Participants evidence retinal pathology ophthalmologic examination consider risk factor neurosensory retinal detachment/central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSCR ) , retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) , neovascular macular degeneration .</criteria>
