	<brief_summary>Hypothesis Study : Based presented result , investigator hypothesis HBO preserve neuron irreversibly damage ( i.e . sever ) initial trauma , thus enable regain function . The investigator predict HBO treatment protects enhance motor function initially paralyse region , include improvement function extremity well recovery urinary bladder control bowel function . Outline Proposed Study : Within prospective `` proof principle '' trial , total 100 patient include . Fifty patient recruit Division Thoracic Hyperbaric Surgery , Medical University Graz . In parallel , 50 control patient include Department Orthopaedics Trauma , Paracelsus University Salzburg , Salzburger Landeskliniken ( SALK ) , Austria . Thereby , patient admit Medical University Graz treat enrolment 50 patient treatment group implement within outlined time frame . The active recruitment period plan three year . Both HBO treat control patient undergo surgical nonsurgical procedure . HBO treatment start within 24 hour injury . A total 21 consecutive daily session apply , follow routine rehabilitation programme . By match control HBO-treated patient , evaluation treatment effect HBO possible . The outcome evaluate implementing American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) -scores magnet resonance ( MR ) imaging . Additionally , inflammatory regenerative blood marker analyse ( neuroendocrine markers/neuro-transmitters : S100beta , Brain Derived Neurotrophic Growth Factor [ BDNF ] , Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein [ GFAP ] , Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) , norepinephrine ; array pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine chemokines ) .</brief_summary>
