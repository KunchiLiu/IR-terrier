	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study . Subjects randomize one two treatment group . Group A receive CX-8998 Group B receive placebo . Subject randomization stratify concomitant primidone use site type ( sub-study v non sub-study ) . Tremor assess via The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ( TETRAS ) accelerometry . In order reduce rater bias , subject videotape TETRAS performance scale test accord consistent script . The videotape rat blinded manner . A subset subject participate electroencephalography ( EEG ) magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) sub-study record power-spectral brain activity specific neuro-anatomical location coherence movement measure . Subjects screen one month prior initiation dosing . At Baseline , subject undergo safety tremor assessment prior dose , receive first dose study drug monitor safety one hour follow dosing . For one week subject receive 4 mg ( match placebo ) twice daily . Subjects return clinic Day 8 safety monitoring dose up-titration 6 mg ( match placebo ) twice daily . At Day 15 ( Week 3 ) subject return clinic safety efficacy assessment final dose up-titration 8 mg ( match placebo ) twice daily . The final efficacy visit occur Day 28 ( Week 4 ) . A final safety visit occur Day 35 ( Week 5 ) .</detailed_description>
