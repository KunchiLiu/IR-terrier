	<detailed_description>Gluten protein network result , hydration knead storage protein contain endosperm certain cereal . Gluten particularly find bread product also find many processed product physicochemical property ( bind , swell property ... ) . This omnipresence blame , grow percentage population report `` intolerance '' gluten . This gluten sensitivity hypothesis frequently associate intestinal disorder ( irritable bowel syndrome , bloating , abdominal pain , chronic diarrhea , constipation ) also headache , fatigue , muscle joint ache , bone fragility , migraine , eczema , depression , anxiety ... . This assumption lead adoption increasingly frequent gluten-free diet among general population , without medical justification . Among population , athletes particularly concern due high prevalence anaphylaxis dependent combination physical exercise food intake ( Maulitz Kidd syndrome ) . This syndrome notably report consumption cereal particular wheat ( bread , pasta ) . However , condition poorly describe regard gluten scientific investigation require rationally characterize benefit gluten-free diet elite athlete . Therefore , clinical project aim study relationship gluten consumption impact digestive comfort , quality life performance non-celiac athlete practice intensive physical activity . All participant give freely write informed consent selection study . Information physical activity , demographic , anthropometrics , vital sign , relevant medical history concomitant medication , dietary habit , usual dietary intake nutritional supplement collect . All inclusion exclusion criterion check investigator co-investigator . Selected participant randomly allocate treatment group ( gluten gluten free ) . Couple family randomise group . After 2 month , subject diet without gluten . All recruit volunteer ask replace bread pasta intake study product ( pasta white bread without gluten ) , maintain usual dietary habit continue normal physical habit . Each 2 month , volunteer physical performance assessment provide blood faeces sample . All volunteer complete follow-up questionnaire obtain information change medication use , disease etc . Each week , subject complete questionnaire relate digestive function : Food Benefits Assessment ( FBA ) ) . At begin 2 month , usual dietary intake estimate mean 3- day food record .</detailed_description>
