	<brief_summary>Non-specific chronic low back pain common multifactorial condition common world population . It define pain discomfort locate ribs gluteal fold may may refer pain leg 12 week . Visceral manipulation manual therapy technique aim normalize mechanical , vascular neurological dysfunction viscera objective improve functioning . Visceral dysfunction may potentially activate exacerbate symptom low back pain presence compromise movement internal organ connective tissue . There two way change visceral mobility could interfere low back pain , refer visceral pain central hypersensitivity . The first occurs due neural convergence , since spinocortical tract send visceral somatic afferences , afferences cross dorsal horn spinal cord . The second prolonged continuous activation nociceptors , due alteration mobility gastrointestinal urinary system , generate central hypersensitivity . Therefore , investigator hypothesize visceral manipulation fascial adherence would lyse visceral spasm would demise , reduce peripheral input , thus , lessen pain low back .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ethical aspect : All volunteer inform experimental procedure submit , well fact affect participant 's health . The participant also clarify secrecy information collect study performance , protect identity participant . After agree participate research , volunteer sign Informed Consent Term , accord resolution 196/96 update resolution 466 2012 National Health Council . Risks : The intervention offer harm participant 's health . There possibility participant feel pain / tickle abdominal palpation . If sensation occur , procedure stop try . If sensation persist participant support session reschedule participant disconnect study way carry propose therapy . Benefits : There may direct immediate benefit , however , expect propose treatment improve lumbar pain . This study offer type health insurance , also , responsibility participant get around bear cost transportation place collection data . Confidentiality privacy research participant guarantee phase research . At time participant withdraw consent participate research without kind penalty . The research team commit make search result public , whether favorable . It worth note placebo intervention procedure always perform association active treatment , make use less impact patient . In addition , patient inform use procedure prior initiation survey . Criteria suspend research : This research suspend event researcher ' death , closure research site termination Term Science Partner Condition / volunteer participate research . Financing This study fund researcher . Source Patients : Patients chronic low back pain refer screening online survey , third party indication , patient wait list Heath Center University Sorocaba . The screening , assessment evaluation perform Health Nucleus Integrated Human Movement Laboratory University Sorocaba . Procedure : The researcher inform study objective procedures patient . If participant agree participate , participant sign inform consent form . After , therapist ass demographic data baseline measure , pain level ( 0-10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale ) , disability associate low back pain ( Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ) , function ( 0-10 Patient-Specific Functional Scale ) Random Allocation : One researcher create randomization code 1:1 allocation radio use Excel Windows software . The code word `` E '' experimental `` P '' placebo , ithe code seal opaque envelope , thus ensure conceal allocation participant group . At first encounter treat therapist , patient choose one envelope table give therapist . The therapist open different room patient allocate patient group accord randomization schedule . Interventions : The volunteer allocate Experimental group Control Group . In Experimental , participant receive Standard care physiotherapy plus Active visceral manipulation , Control receive Standard care physiotherapy Placebo visceral manipulation . The standard care physiotherapy last 40 minute visceral mobilisation take around 10 minute . Blinding : The assessor therapist blind others work . Therefore assessor knowledge treatment allocation perform three assessment , pre assessment , immediately last treatment 1 week treatment . Similarly , therapist know pre- post-assessment intervention . In addition , one assessor one therapist research decrease bias . To test blinding , last treatment session , assessor write patient 's assessment chart type intervention ( active placebo ) think participant receive . These code later compare randomization code . Statistical method : Statistical analysis use SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) v.19.0 . Initially Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed . If data normal , parametric test apply , distribution non-normal , non-parametric test use . It calculate effect size , mean difference mean pre-intervention evaluation post-intervention evaluation . In analyzes , critical level 5 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) set .</detailed_description>
