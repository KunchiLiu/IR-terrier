	<detailed_description>This Phase IV , randomize , open-label , single-site study Saint Louis University enroll approximately 40 subject healthy , 18 49 year old . Subjects randomized 1:1 fashion receive either license trivalent FluMist ( 2010-2011 season appropriate ) , license inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine ( 2010-2011 season appropriate ) approximately 20 subject randomize receive LAIV , 20 receive TIV . Subjects receive 1 dose FluMist TIV Center Vaccine Development Day 0 return site day 7 45 assess immunogenicity . Subjects ask report serious adverse event . Blood sample nasal wash assessment immune response obtain three time point : Day 0 prior dose FluMist TIV , visit conduct 7 45-51 day post vaccination . The study conduct prior influenza season . Subjects receive single dose FluMist TIV administer instruct per package insert . Two contact make subject , either telephone call e-mail , collect serious adverse event , one Days 28-35 , one approximately Days 180-190 conclude subject 's participation . The duration subject 's participation approximately 6 month . The primary immune study conduct collected sample include serum hemagglutinin inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer , nasal wash influenza-specific secretory immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) responses , peripheral blood interferon gamma ( IFN-γ ) ELISPOT assay peripheral blood carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) dilution/intracellular cytokine stain flow cytometric assay . In addition , frozen serum peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) sample use exploratory assay determine kinetics nature innate response detail molecular signature memory T cell induce LAIV TIV vaccination . Investigators perform genome-wide expression study , perform DNA sequence send anything cod sample outside Saint Louis University .</detailed_description>
