	<brief_summary>The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( CGA ) , still today , barely establish standard practice . Although different scientific society recommend CGA elderly population affect cancer first visit , evidence regard transcendence limit . On hand , component evaluation translation finding change clinical practice stablished . This project intend implement CGA group patient compare group historical cohort reflect standard practice , evaluate difference approach . The study also evaluate feasibility utility CGA . All question aim support hypothesis CGA impact cancer treatment elderly population affect cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frailty Evaluation Elderly Population With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare two group elderly patient affect stage IV non-small lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , stage III colon cancer stage IV colorectal cancer ( CRC ) : prospective experimental cohort historic control cohort . The sample size 60 patient , 30 prospective 30 retrospective . Of cohort , 10 patient stage IV NSCLC , 10 stage III colon cancer 10 stage IV CRC . Prospective patient recruit longitudinally January 2013 retrospective patient record longitudinally backward time December 2012 . Both group patient Medical Oncology Service Hospital General Universitario de Elche , group sign inform consent form . A CGA perform experimental group first visit oncologist prior therapeutic decision . This CGA include : - Nutritional Assessment : Mini Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) - Functional Assessment : Get Go , Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) , Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) , Karnofsky Scale , Walking one Block , Number Falls last 6 month Hearing Loss . - Cognitive Assessment : Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE-30 ) - Psychological status : Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) - Social Support : Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey ( MOS-SSS ) - Comorbidity Severity Comorbidities : Charlson Comorbidity Index Adult Comorbidity Evaluation ( ACE-27 ) The evaluation include age , haemoglobin , Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) presence geriatric syndrome . The result evaluation allow calculate : - Early mortality risk accord Soubeyran et al ( JCO 2012 , 30 : 1829-1834 ) ( MNA Get Go ) : - risk early mortality - risk early mortality . - Toxicity chemotherapy accord Hurria et al . ( J Clin Oncol 2011 , 29 : 3457-3465 ) ( age , type cancer , dose number chemotherapy drug , haemoglobin , CrCl , hear loss , number fall last 6 month , ability take medication without help ( IADL ) , walk one block social support ( MOS-SSS ) : - low risk - medium risk - high risk . - Frailty group accord Köhne et al ( The Oncologist 2008 , 13 : 390-402 ) ( ADL , IADL , comorbidity severity comorbidities presence geriatric syndrome ) . This information dictate therapeutic strategy experimental patient : - Group 1 : standard treatment . - Group 2 : modify treatment - Group 3 : treatment Experimental patient follow six month CGA toxicity severity , occurrence treatment modification , number hospitalization reason hospitalization mortality reason mortality compare item historic control , follow six month moment physician make therapeutic decision . Other data record group : sex , age , origin , leucocytes , platelet , LDH , albumin , CEA , Cr Cl , haemoglobin , subjective weight loss , corporal mass index , comorbidities , primary tumor : stage , metastases location , treatment intent : adjuvant , palliative , number drug , number concomitant medication , PS accord ECOG Karnofsky ( data expect miss historic group ) . Only historic control , physician answer one question : In wich category would include treatment recommendation ? accord Köhne , The Oncologist 2008 : Balducci , The Oncologist 2000 ; J Clin Oncol 2012 : - standard treatment - modify treatment - treatment despite treatment recommend - treatment Only historic control two question answer : - Has Geriatric Evaluation perform ? Yes No - What sort evaluation ? The trial record long take test long take complete CGA . All information record database anonymous code subject . Statistical analysis consist descriptive analysis sociodemographic clinical characteristic cohort . It perform also non-parametric analysis compare characteristic experimental group . A descriptive analysis daily life characteristic experimental group perform , also non-parametric analysis compare variable experimental group . Changes due CGA incorporation evaluate variable measure toxicity early mortality correlate coincidence treatment perform one conclude geriatric evaluation . Contribution different element CGA evaluate . A multiple regression perform order carry evaluation degree contribution element CGA . A significance `` p '' le 0.05 consider significant . There study limitation : size , miss data historic patient , monocentric study .</detailed_description>
