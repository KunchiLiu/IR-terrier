	<brief_summary>Rationale : The current limitation prostate cancer diagnostics , due lack accuracy available technique , lead over- undertreatment significant fraction patient prostate cancer . Multiparametric ultrasound ( mpUS ) , new image modality combine different ultrasound parameter , herald potential accurate imaging-based diagnostic approach accessible community large formal validation mpUS final pathology result still lack . Objective : To validate mpUS image modality detection localization prostate cancer direct correlation histopathology radical prostatectomy specimen</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systematic transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) -guided biopsy men clinical suspicion prostate cancer , base digital rectal examination ( DRE ) and/or prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) diagnostic strategy year . However , method know limited sensitivity risk , many men without cancer undergo unnecessary biopsy , clinically insignificant cancer often detect significant cancer miss under-graded biopsy procedure carry discomfort morbidity . Prostate image capable identify clinically significant disease target biopsy high accuracy efficiency thus importance . mpMRI ( multiparametric magnetic resonance image ) mpMRI-targeted biopsy increasingly use , improved ability detect clinically significant cancer , reduce diagnosis insignificant cancer compare TRUS-guided biopsy . Nevertheless , mpMRI limited inter-reader variability , high level expertise requirement heterogeneity definition mpMRI-targeted biopsy alone still miss clinical significant cancer reveal TRUS-guided biopsy . There ongoing search new cost-effective , manageable image technology adequate prostate cancer diagnosis . Various ultrasound modality development strive increase cancer detection among contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) elastography . Preliminary result multiparametric ultrasound ( mpUS ) approach , combine different ultrasound modality , seem promise . The number quality study available , however , relatively low , emphasize need work define role mpUS . This investigator-initiated , prospective in-vivo validation study human validate mpUS image modality detection localization prostate cancer direct correlation histopathology . Biopsy-proven prostate cancer patient schedule radical prostatectomy approach consent enter study . Information study provide verbally write form . Participants undergo mpUS image prior surgery . For contrast enhanced mode mpUS additional infusion ultrasound contrast agent intravenous cannula use transrectal ultrasound scan purpose study . The mpUS image data evaluate qualitatively semi-quantitatively use parametric map prostate ultrasound expert blind radical prostatectomy histopathology . Histopathology evaluate qualitatively uro-pathologist blind mpUS image result . Hence , image data correlate histopathology blind fashion use 3D registration system 3D reconstruction model . Predictive accuracy mpUS image detection localization prostate cancer histopathology analyze . At later stage , mpUS classifier , optimally combine relevant ultrasound parameter modality one single result mpUS parameter develop . Furthermore , additional clinical value mpUS image prostate cancer diagnostics determine compare mpUS result available mpMRI data . mpMRI image data evaluate uro-radiologist use PI-RADS ( Prostate Imaging Reporting Data System ) criterion blind radical prostatectomy result .</detailed_description>
