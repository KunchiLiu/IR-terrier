	<brief_summary>Phosphorus widely use sport supplement . Most athlete use follow phosphorus load approach consist weeklong phosphorus intake 3-4 gr per day optimal effect . The ergogenic potential phosphorus believe related several factor include ability ) enhance ATP availability energy expenditure b ) increase plasma content 2.3-DPG ( 2.3-disphosphoglycerate ) know reduce oxygen affinity hemoglobin consequently enhance release exercise tissue . Additionally , phosphorus report increase peripheral glucose uptake thus glycogenesis glycogen storage . We recently observe peripheral glucose uptake stimulate co-ingestion phosphorus meal , pre ingestion fail . Thus reasonable postulate phosphorus co-ingestion meal improve ergogenesis enhance glycogen storage . The aim experiment investigate whether acute phosphate supplementation glucose load responsible performance enhancement . This may help explain controversy surround impact phosphorus performance . A cross study conduct water polo player . In brief , overnight fasted subject , give glucose load without phosphorus . Three hour later performance measure use ergometer cycling machine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use phosphorus ergogenic aid widely report researched ( Buck et al , 2013 ) . Most research center chronic intake effect , usually load period 3-6 day ( Kopec et al , 2015 ) . The benefit phosphate supplementation athletic performance attribute several potential factor , like increase maximal oxygen uptake improve cardiac output ( Folland et al , 2008 ) . The underlying mechanism hypothesize increase plasma content 2.3-DPG ( 2.3-disphosphoglycerate ) may factor reduce oxygen affinity hemoglobin consequent enhance release exercise tissue ( Di Caprio et al , 2015 ) . Other line investigation , base blood analysis hypophosphatemia 's effect metabolism ( Lichtman et al , 1971 ) , rate glycogenolysis exercise muscle rate inorganic phosphorus ( Chasiotis , 1988 ) , attribute beneficial effect phosphate supplementation high extracellular concentration lead increased ATP formation . A positive effect phosphate supplementation detect independently 2.3-DPG recent study ( Czuba et al , 2009 ) . Additionally , increase phosphate availability report increase peripheral glucose uptake ( Khattab et al 2015 ) stimulate glycogen synthesis ( Xie et al , 2000 ) . The failure acute phosphate supplementation alone , without carbohydrate , affect athletic performance ( Galloway et al , 1996 ) may partially attribute low glycogen availability . We hypothesize phosphorus exerts effect acutely increase glycogen content liver muscle . Hence acute effect Phosphorus physiologic dose athletic performance may reveal another aspect phosphate supplementation . If improvement work output detect , significant difference Metabolic Equivalent Tasks ( METs ) workload would indicate , could interpret result high glycogen formation lead increased work output due muscle signal ( Rauch et al , 2005 ) . The current trial allow 3 hour absorption estimate likely benefit phosphorus supplementation enhance glucose uptake possibly limit phosphorus depletion normal condition , notice experiment Khattab et al . ( 2015 ) . The risk change blood osmolality due administration 100gr Dextrose usually use OGTT minimal ( Finta et al , 1992 ) . Methods : Inclusion criterion : AUB water polo player age 18 25 year old , shall include study . Risk assessment : It note university require clearance Family Medicine follow general health cardiac screening ( ECG ) inclusion varsity team , indicate trial include increase risk participate athlete . The health survey fill Family Medicine department physician include presence allergy previous medical condition . A cross study conduct 17 male athlete ( member American University Beirut 's Water Polo Varsity Team ) , know similar energy expenditure exercise pattern . Overnight fast subject deplete glycogen . Participants ask cycle 20 min 65 % one 's VO2max ( determine prior experiment ) , thereafter give meal ( 100g glucose dissolve 300 ml ) 4 tablet phosphorus ( 100mg/tablet ) placebo random order . Three hour later , participant ask cycle 40 min , use nutrition lab 's CPET cyclometer cardiopulmonary exercise test machine COSMED 80 % maximal heartrate ( measured water polo training session ) . The heartrate training determine use waterproof heartrate monitor , PoolMateHR make Swimovate consist specially design low frequency detector transmit water explain maker . Body fat determine use In-Body Bio-Electric Impedance machine nutrition lab . The ergometer determine METs allow u detect potential ergogenic gain . Procedure : 1 . Identification recruitment subject : Subjects approach swim pool water polo training take place . An overall briefing study give varsity player interested , detailed explanation give . 2 . After read sign consent form party , participate athlete ask training session wear heartrate monitor , PoolMateHR make Swimovate , determine heartbeat range typical training session include warm-up , drill water polo game . 3 . On day experiment follow overnight fast , participant take test facility [ Faculty Agriculture Food Sciences/Department Nutrition Food Science ] : anthropometric measurement take ( height , weight , WC ) , addition body composition analysis use bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) individual stand digital scale run electrical current body order determine composition ( bone , fat , muscle , water , specific distribution ) 4 . The participant ask cycle ergometer 20 minute average 65 % maximal heartrate determine training , wear mouthpiece , familiar process . Afterwards , serve flavored drink contain 100 g glucose dissolve 300 ml water , either 4 pill contain 100 mg ( total 400 mg ) phosphorus placebo . 5 . The participant ask sit relaxed position perform major physical activity . Three hour later , ask cycle ergometer 40 minute average 80 % determine maximal heartrate training wear breathe mask . 6 . The METs workload measure use CPET . Analysis Results : Statistical Method : Sample size determine use formula two pair sample : n ≥ ( σd /δd ) 2 ( Zα+Zβ ) 2 reversely correlated size effect , directly correlate Power . Since supplementation relatively safe , especially low dos use , improvement valuable , opted Power 70 80 % . Time trial result compare workload METs two sample use t-test , estimate effect acute phosphate supplementation glycogen replenishment . The hypothesized increase workload phosphate supplementation interpret result glycogen signal lead high output per suggestion glycogen signal experiment ( Rauch et al. , 2005 ) .</detailed_description>
