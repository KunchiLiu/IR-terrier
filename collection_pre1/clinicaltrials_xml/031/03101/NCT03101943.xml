	<brief_summary>This study aim assess impact brief home-visiting module , call `` Family Spirit Nurture '' ( FSN ) , American Indian ( AI ) parent feed practice associate increase risk early childhood obesity , primary focus delay introduction infant ' Sugar Sweetened Beverage ( SSB ) ( include soda , energy drink , juice add sugar drink add sugar ) intake teach mother complementary feed responsive parenting practice . The investigator also assess water insecurity may moderate parent ' feed SSBs young child . Finally , investigator explore whether maternal knowledge oral health practice and/or reduction infant ' SSB intake influence early indicator infant 's oral health ( i.e. , infant ' oral microbiome plaque formation ) . Our evaluation employ randomize controlled design , control condition receive beneficial home-safety educational model assistance safety proof home small child . Assessments group occur baseline ( 6 10 week postpartum ) 4 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month postpartum . Primary Aims : Aim 1 : To determine effectiveness brief ( 6 lesson ) FSN home-visiting parent feeding practice module reduce SSB initiation frequency among infant 3 12 month age . Hypothesis 1 : Infants whose mother receive FSN vs. control less likely introduce SSBs 3 12 month age . Aim 2 : To determine effectiveness FSN promote optimal complementary feeding responsive parenting practice . Hypothesis 2 : Mothers receive FSN vs. control likely practice recommend complementary feeding responsive parenting practice 3 12 month age . Aim 3 : To determine impact water insecurity SSB consumption among infant 3 6 month age . Hypothesis 2 : Parents report water insecurity vs. likely give infant SSBs 3 6 month age . Secondary Aims : Secondary Aim 1 : To explore provision water family reduce SSB intake among mother infant age 6 9 month age . Secondary Aim 2 : To explore infant FSN intervention well oral health outcome control infants 12 month postpartum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct pilot randomize 1:1 control trial 136 mother-infant dyad . Participants pre-screened water insecurity distribute equally across two study arm use stratified block randomization . The intervention group ( n=68 ) receive FSN home-visiting module , consist six 45-minute lesson deliver biweekly trained local AI Family Health Coaches ( FHCs ) , 3 6 month postpartum . The lesson focus elimination reduction Sugar Sweetened Beverages ( SSBs ) among infant teach mother complementary feed responsive parenting practice . The control group ( n=68 ) receive three home-based lesson home safety information ( injury prevention priority identify Navajo leadership interfere study question ) . All family receive delivery drinking water 6 9 month postpartum . Through staggered design , investigator evaluate impact FSN infant feeding practice associate increase risk early childhood obesity , primary focus delay introduction infant 's SSB intake . The investigator also able evaluate impact availability potable water SSB intake , without family education . In addition , participant opportunity provide additional consent nest oral health study evaluate impact FSN curriculum water provision infant oral health indicator . Methods : Study implementation include four phase : Phase 1 ( Referral , Recruitment , Consent , Baseline Assessment Randomization ) : Potentially eligible mother refer study staff , screen eligibility , consent/assent mother , conduct baseline assessment , assign randomization status . Randomization assign completion baseline assessment , include score participant 's water insecurity status . Two randomization list ( one water secure mother one water insecure mother ) create prior study initiation use STATA 14 statistical software37 . Part 2 ( Home-Based Education Intervention ) : Local FHCs , train employ Johns Hopkins , deliver either intervention ( 6-session FSN ) control condition ( 3- Home-Safety Lessons ) 3 6 month postpartum . Part 3 ( Water Delivery ) : All participant drink water deliver home 6 9 month postpartum . FHCs deliver water either weekly less often , depend need family . The amount water deliver base number adult child reside home period study . Part 4 ( Assessment ) : Our assessment post-baseline consist mixed-methods assessment , include maternal self-reports maternal FHC-administered interview collect use REDCap 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 12 month postpartum maternal infant medical chart review . If consent give nested oral health study , additional assessment include maternal self-report measure , collection microbiologic test infant plaque saliva , infant oral examination , tooth eruption evaluation infant medical dental chart review .</detailed_description>
