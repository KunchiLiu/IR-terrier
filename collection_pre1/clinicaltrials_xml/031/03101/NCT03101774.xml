	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training Respiratory Muscle Function，Quality Life Exercise Capacity Stable COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) define sustained expiratory flow limitation small airway disease major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Dyspnoea vital symptom lead exercise-limiting COPD major reason physical activity reduction consequently contribute dysfunction skeletal muscle include diaphragm . Diaphragm sarcopenia well document important extrapulmonary manifestation COPD . It suggest reduction exercise capacity conversely related muscle weakness present patient consequently impact negatively quality life . It also contribute hypoxaemia hypercapnia progressive stage . Mutiple pulmonary rehabilitation program regular physical care stable patient COPD improve extrapulmonary disease manifestation . Inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) serve one pulmonary rehabilitation program aim diaphragmatic improvement use constantly extensively study recent year stable patient COPD . From meta-analyses randomise control trial ( RCTs ) patient COPD , conclude IMT stand-alone therapy prove increase inspiratory muscle strength endurance , decrease dyspnea , improve exercise capacity quality life . It also conclude COPD patient inspiratory muscle weakness define PI , max &lt; 60 cmH2O likely significantly improve inspiratory muscle strength functional exercise capacity IMT apply . IMT define persistent breathe training use inspiratory training device . Inspiratory muscle trainer classify inspiratory resistive trainers® inspiratory threshold trainers® accord operation principle . The former contain build-in spring-loaded valve provide continuous , pre-determined inspiratory load entire inspiratory phase ; The latter provide constant inspiratory load ensure intensity inspiratory training . There great difference operation principle two inspiratory muscle trainer . Inspiratory resistance generate inspiratory resistive trainer depend inspiratory flow rate , however threshold load independent inspiratory flow . Intensity load two IMT device repectively adjust . However , therapic effect IMT remain undefined due disunity IMT device load previous study . Various device load arouse different train intensity key point secure train effect . The optimized IMT program proper device load figure . The investigator ' previous study elaborate detailed respiratory physiological response IMT COPD . Comparable RCTs clinical therapeutic effect use respiratory physiology-oriented IMT device different operation principle COPD far lack . Therefore investigator perform adequately power RCT effect two IMT device application pulmonary physical therapy patient COPD inspiratory muscle weakness .</detailed_description>
