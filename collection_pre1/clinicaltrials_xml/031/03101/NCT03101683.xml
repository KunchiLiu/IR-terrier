	<brief_title>Radiotherapy After Mastectomy Breast Cancer Patients Increased Risk Local Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There uncertainty indication chest wall irradiation patient submit mastectomy plus immediate implant-based reconstruction : A ) negative axillary node additional risk factor ; B ) 1-3 positive axillary node additional risk factor . The reduction locoregional recurrence valuable clinical psychological standpoint may also translate survival advantage . Nevertheless , whole chest wall radiotherapy associate significant toxicity due irradiation non-target organ significant worsen cosmetic result prosthetic-based breast reconstruction ( capsular contracture , implant displacement , infection ) . Most Institution adopt NAC spar mastectomy standard treatment non-locally advanced breast cancer patient amenable breast conserving surgery . Available literature data , include data , suggest patient local recurrence NAC area exceedingly rare , local recurrence occur original tumor locate . It accept , select breast cancer patient submit breast conserve surgery , accelerate partial breast radiotherapy associate similar recurrence rate compare whole breast radiotherapy favorable cosmetic outcome . Therefore , hypothesize partial chest wall radiotherapy quadrant original tumor locate NAC spar mastectomy may associate reduction local recurrence significantly reduce complication prosthetic-based breast reconstruction . STUDY DESCRIPTION : This single-arm prospective study ass feasibility , toxicity cosmetic outcome partial radiotherapy chest wall breast cancer patient increase risk local relapse submit skin/nipple-areola complex ( NAC ) spar mastectomy immediate implant-based reconstruction STUDY TYPE Interventional STUDY DESIGN Endpoint Classification : Feasibility/Safety Study Intervention Model : Single Group Assignment Masking : Open Label Primary Purpose : Treatment INCLUSION CRITERIA AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( see ) RADIOLOGY All patient submit preoperative full radiological work include mammography , ultrasound scan breast MRI order define precise tumor localization extension ( e.g . area cover multiple tumor focus and/or extension situ associate invasive tumor ) . Immediately surgery , non-permanent mark place delineate skin cover breast area involve tumor two projection photograph take stored . SURGERY NAC spar skin-sparing ( case preoperative/intraoperative diagnosis tumor involvement nipple duct ) mastectomy perform raise thin skin flap level superficial deep fascia . The specimen orient three dimension placement stitch send definitive pathology . The area pectoralis major muscle localize tumor delineate place 4 titanium radiopaque clip cardinal point . Nodal stag perform either sentinel node biopsy , intraoperative evaluation immediate/delayed full axillary dissection case macrometastatic sentinel node , immediate full axillary dissection case preoperative citological diagnosis metastatic axillary node . RADIOTHERAPY The tumor bed defined area risk ( skin pectoralis muscle ) delineate indelible skin mark ( place guidance preoperative non-permanent skin mark ) surgical clip 3D-MRI reconstruction precise localization tumor excise . The clinical target volume ( CTV ) define tumor bed 1.5 cm margin limit skin contour . The plan tumor volume ( PTV ) define use 4D-CT imaging include CTV plus 0.3/0.5 mm setup error contribution . Internal target volume ( ITV ) account motion CTV patient . Contouring target organ risk ( OARs ) perform use 3D-CT 4D-CT imaging . All patient scan Aquilion Big Bore CT scanner ( Toshiba ) . For generate 4D-CT datasets , respiratory sensor box , integrate CT scanner reconstruction , place patient 's chest . After scan , source data respiratory signal use retrospectively reconstruct image . A maximum intensity projection ( MIP ) reconstruction respiratory phase use delineate target volume . The contouring OARs perform use 3D-CT image . Treatment plan perform use Eclipse Treatment Planning System ( TPS ) Tomotherapy TPS . Patients treat Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy ( VMAT ) technique ( 1/2 half arc ) helical Tomotherapy use 6 MV photon beam . Treatment plan optimize coverage homogeneity . Clinically significant maximum target dose 112 % consider acceptable . A comparison plan use standard tangential field perform patient . A dose 40 Gy deliver 16 fraction ( 2.5 Gy per fraction ) . For conventional post-mastectomy radiotherapy moderately hypofractionated schedule consider feasible safe ( 31 ) . Even , schedule feasible safe small irradiated volume current protocol . Regional nodal irradiation consider Institution patient fulfil entry criterion protocol . For patient setup verification , cone-beam kVCT MVCT scan perform treatment fraction compare planning CT. Automatic registration reference verification image realise ; patient position correct use 6-degrees freedom robotic couch top ( linac ) 4-degrees freedom robotic couch top ( Tomotherapy ) . Patients immobilized use arm shuttle device . OUTCOME MEASURES PRIMARY 1 . To assess feasibility PCWRT via VMAT-IGRT linac-based helical Tomotherapy Surgical clip permanent skin mark must allow proper identification tumor bed CT image board imaging ( CBCT-MVCT ) . The dose distribution must respect standard dose constraint utilized conventional CWRT . The following parameter evaluate : 1.1 . Patient set-up reproducibility 1.2 . Plan reproducibility vivo dosimetry 1.3 . Dosimetrical reduction PCWRT vs. conventional CWRT 2 . To assess safety PCWRT via VMAT-IGRT linac-based helical Tomotherapy With hypofractionated CWRT frequent toxicity acute skin toxicity ( G2 skin toxicity 10 % case ) . All toxicity expect low PCWRT compare conventional CWRT since radiation field small . The following parameter evaluate : 2.1 . Acute late cutaneous toxicity 2.2 . Late subcutaneous fibrosis 2.3 . Radiation pneumonitis 3 . To assess surgical complication implant-based breast reconstruction PCWRT Reconstruction failure ( RF ) , define removal tissue expander/prosthesis , conventional CWRT report 20 % case . As toxicity , also surgical complication rate expect low PCWRT compare conventional CWRT since radiation field small . The following parameter evaluate : 3.1 . Infections , Skin/NAC necrosis , major revision , early capsular contracture 3.2 . Complication rate lead implant removal . SECONDARY 1 . To assess cosmetic outcome implant-based breast reconstruction PCWRT 1.1 An acceptable cosmetic result ( excellent good , scale excellent-good-fair-poor ) define stable reconstruction good symmetry contour relative contralateral breast . 1.2 Outcome measure mean photographic analysis use five view ( frontal , right leave lateral , right leave quarter view ) independent assessment result plastic surgeon treat patient . 1.3 The modify Baker classification use score extent contracture see photographs 2 . To assess patient ' satisfaction implant-based breast reconstruction PCWRT 2.1 The BREAST-Q Reconstruction Module Patient Satisfaction Breasts survey administer treatment predetermined time interval SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS No sample size calculation appropriate main purpose propose study ass feasibility PCWRT order explore intervention large clinical trial . Based clinical activity past 3 year Institute , 20 potential candidate per year expect . If 70 % enrolment rate hypothesize , target accrual 28 patient could complete two year . This target allow assess primary endpoint 1. appropriately provide estimate endpoint 2. 3. used design subsequent large clinical trial .</detailed_description>
