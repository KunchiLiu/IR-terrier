	<detailed_description>Antibiotic resistance continue grow consider one serious global threat 21st century . The key driver resistance antibiotic overuse ; long antibiotic course select resistance among trillion bacteria host human body . There yet evidence randomized study optimal duration antibiotic therapy . Traditionally , guideline somewhat arbitrarily recommend long course two week , even though patient structural complication may recover five day therapy . Evidence mount long course leave patient multi-resistant organism . Indeed , give rise concern resistance , many physician reduce antibiotic duration GNB 7 day apparent untoward consequence . This point-of-care , multicenter randomize control non-inferiority trial randomize 500 patient GNB day 5 appropriate antibiotic therapy either ( 1 ) total 7 day antibiotic therapy , ( 2 ) total 14 day antibiotic therapy , ( 3 ) individualize duration antibiotic therapy ( guided patient 's clinical course &amp; C-reactive protein level ) . The primary outcome incidence clinical failure day 30 . Patients follow day 90 ; secondary outcome include incidence clinical failure day 60 90 , total number antibiotic day , incidence antibiotic-related adverse event ( include Clostridium difficile infection ) , emergence bacterial resistance , length hospital stay . Cost-effectiveness/health-economic analysis also perform .</detailed_description>
