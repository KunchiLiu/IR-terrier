	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label , multi-center early phase II study . This proof concept study investigate whether combine use local tumor ablation/radiation plus immunomodulating drug may induce significant immune response patient incurable liver metastasis colorectal cancer ( CRC ) ( +/- limit extrahepatic disease ) stable partial remission completion 4-6 month first line systemic therapy . The primary objective study show overall response rate lesion treat ablation/radiotherapy include extrahepatic lesion ( accord iRECIST criterion ) high 10 % . With continuation first line systemic treatment , response expect . Secondary objective : - To establish feasibility safety combine treatment modality ; - To study impact local technique ( RFA/Radiotherapy ) result ; - To investigate biomarkers predict response combine treatment</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm CRC Patients CRC liver metastasis , without extrahepatic disease , curative treatment possible resection local ablation/radiotherapy . Men woman ≥ 18 year age time study entry WHO performance status 0 1 , registration well start first line systemic treatment Body weight &gt; 30kg Available baseline imaging , start first line treatment , measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 Stable disease partial remission RECIST criterion 46 month first line therapy CRC ( least doublet fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin combination without VEGFinhibitor antiEGFR agent ) . Complete responder partial responder 80 % decrease sum measure ( long diameter tumour lesion short axis measure node ) target lesion follow first line therapy , take reference sum diameter baseline scan prior initiation first line therapy exclude well patient almost complete cystic degeneration liver metastasis . Liver metastases amenable ablation stereotactic radiotherapy ( SBRT ) completion 46 month first line therapy : For SBRT : allow total ablated volume least 25 cm3 maximum 40 cm3 maximum two lesion treat SBRT For RFA : allow total ablated volume least 25 cm3 maximum advise volume 120 cm3 After local tumour ablation/SBRT , least two measurable liver metastasis least 1 measurable liver metastasis 1 measurable extrahepatic lesion remain unaffected ablation SBRT allow response monitoring accord RECIST 1.1 iRECIST . Limited extra hepatic disease allow , include 2 extra hepatic metastatic site , either lung , abdominal , pelvis , bone , localize lymph node metastasis . Each account separately one site . So , two abdominal lesion account 1 extrahepatic site , one lung one abdominal lesion account two site . Individual extrahepatic lesion ≤ 5 cm . Availability tumour sample biomarkers test ( MSI , PDL1 , etc ) ( archival tissue primary tumour ) Adequate normal organ marrow function initial first line systemic treatment well baseline define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ( &gt; 1500 per mm3 ) Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L ( &gt; 100,000 per mm3 ) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . This apply subject confirm Gilbert 's syndrome ( persistent recurrent hyperbilirubinemia predominantly unconjugated absence hemolysis hepatic pathology ) , allow consultation physician . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 5 x institutional upper limit normal Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN measure calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min CockcroftGault formula Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL baseline Evidence postmenopausal status female premenopausal patient negative urinary serum pregnancy test . Women consider postmenopausal amenorrheic 12 month without alternative medical cause . The follow agespecific requirement apply : Women &lt; 50 year age would consider postmenopausal amenorrheic 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment luteinizing hormone folliclestimulating hormone level postmenopausal range institution underwent surgical sterilization ( bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ) . Women ≥50 year age would consider postmenopausal amenorrheic 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , radiationinduced menopause last menses &gt; 1 year ago , chemotherapyinduced menopause last menses &gt; 1 year ago , underwent surgical sterilization ( bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral salpingectomy hysterectomy ) . Patients childbearing / reproductive potential use adequate birth control measure , define investigator , study treatment period screen 90 day last dose durvalumab monotherapy 180 day last dose durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy . A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Female subject breast feed discontinue nursing prior first dose study treatment screen 90 day last dose durvalumab monotherapy 180 day last dose durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy . Subject willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow . Before patient registration/randomization , write informed consent must give accord ICH/GCP , national/local regulation Patients know brain metastasis history leptomeningeal carcinomatosis History radiation therapy liver , upper abdomen low thorax History radioembolization liver Hilar liver lesion close central bile duct treat RFA Major surgical procedure ( defined Investigator ) within 28 day prior first dose IP . Note : Local surgery isolate lesion palliative intent acceptable . Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 previous anticancer therapy exception alopecia , vitiligo , laboratory value define inclusion criterion Patients Grade ≥2 neuropathy evaluate casebycase basis consultation Study Physician . Patients irreversible toxicity reasonably expect exacerbated treatment durvalumab tremelimumab may include consultation Study Physician . Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab , CTLA4 include tremelimumab checkpoint inhibitor immune therapy last 12 month Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 14 day first dose durvalumab tremelimumab , exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10 mg/day prednisone , equivalent corticosteroid , steroid premedication hypersensitivity reaction ( eg , CT scan premedication ) Receipt live attenuate vaccination within 30 day prior study entry within 30 day receive durvalumab Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder ( include inflammatory bowel disease [ eg , colitis Crohn 's disease ] , diverticulitis [ exception diverticulosis ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sarcoidosis syndrome , Wegener syndrome [ granulomatosis polyangitis , Graves ' disease , rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc ] ) . The following exception criterion : Patients vitiligo alopecia Patients hypothyroidism ( eg , follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement Any chronic skin condition require systemic therapy Patients without active disease last 5 year may include consultation study physician Patients celiac disease control diet alone History allogeneic organ transplant History hypersensitivity durvalumab , tremelimumab excipient Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Active infection include tuberculosis ( clinical evaluation include clinical history , physical examination radiographic finding , TB test line local practice ) , hepatitis B ( know positive HBV surface antigen ( HBsAg ) result ) , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus ( positive HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Patients past resolve HBV infection ( define presence hepatitis B core antibody [ antiHBc ] absence HBsAg ) eligible . Patients positive hepatitis C ( HCV ) antibody eligible polymerase chain reaction negative HCV RNA . Symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia Active peptic ulcer disease gastritis Liver cirrhosis CHILD B+ , C Active bleeding diatheses History primary immunodeficiency Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise ability subject give write informed consent Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥470 m calculate 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) use Frediricia 's Correction Female patient pregnant breastfeed male female patient reproductive potential willing employ effective birth control screen 90 day last dose durvalumab monotherapy 180 day last dose durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy . Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient registration trial</criteria>
