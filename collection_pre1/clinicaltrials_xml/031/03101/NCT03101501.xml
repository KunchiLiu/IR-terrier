	<brief_title>A Prospective Study To Evaluate The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay In Presybopic Patients Treated With Mitomycin C Following Femtosecond Flap Creation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The scientific objective study evaluate postoperative incidence corneal reaction patient treat low dose Mitomycin C , immediately follow femtosecond flap creation ( LASIK correction need ) , implantation Raindrop corneal inlay non-dominant eye . The postoperative incidence haze , visible broad tangential illumination slit lamp , know adversely impact safety efficacy Raindrop corneal inlay . Three main strategy employ minimize haze incidence surgery : ( ) perfection surgical technique , ( ii ) deep implantation cornea , ( iii ) extension steroid regimen surgery . Haze also observe another type corneal refractive procedure , Photorefractive Keratectomy ( PRK ) . Several prospective study show Mitomycin C , apply immediately follow PRK laser procedure , effective reduce postoperative incidence haze .</detailed_description>
