	<brief_summary>The standard treatment locally advanced cervical cancer concurrent chemo-radiotherapy . This treatment associate long term side effect around half patient 10 % suffer grade 3-4 toxicity . The development intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) allow shape radiotherapy field reduce dos deliver organ risk ( OARs ) . This appear reduce risk long short term toxicity ( although little randomized evidence ) . However pelvic organ position varies even radiotherapy fraction ; mean radiotherapy margin must generous allow adequate coverage clinical target volume ( CTV ) also increase dose OARs . There number study evaluate pelvic organ motion cervical cancer well assess different adaptive radiotherapy strategy . These include individualized margin , plan day adaptive technique . Most study carry use cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) image often poor quality limit soft tissue contrast . MR offer good visualization tumour OARs use image guided brachytherapy treatment . This study explore role MR image adaptive radiotherapy cervical cancer development number theoretical treatment strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Using Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) Assess Cervix Motion During Radiotherapy Treatment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo standard treatment study five week external beam radiotherapy ( 25 fraction ) follow MR guide brachytherapy boost external beam boost ( 10 fraction . ) They treat weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 clinically appropriate . As part standard treatment patient stag MR scan diagnosis , radiotherapy planning CT MR scan 4th week treatment . Cone beam imaging also perform . Response assess standard MR scan 3 month . As part study patient undergo 3 additional MR scan . These take place 1st , 2nd 5th week treatment . Extra sequence add clinical mid-point scan 4th week treatment . These MR scan include anatomical image - full empty bladder well cine data ( scan every minute 10 minute ) assess intra fraction motion . They also include DWI sequence , use assess early prediction response possible . The frequency cone beam image increase approximately 10 scan standard care 25 scan allow daily imaging . The 1st MR scan contour outline clinical target volume ( CTVs ) OARs . A variety planning strategy develop include standard plan target volume ( PTV ) margin , plan day ( POTD ) approach , POTD+ well online adaptation model . These model use assess coverage CTV PTV well dose OARs use scan obtain radiotherapy treatment . The practicality approach also assess . Inter intra fraction organ motion also analyse order develop patient specific model .</detailed_description>
