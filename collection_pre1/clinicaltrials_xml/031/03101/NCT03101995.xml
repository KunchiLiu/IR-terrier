	<brief_summary>From global burden Cervical Cancer ( CC ) , 85 % occur develop country , represent 12 % cancer woman . In Mexico CC rank second incidence mortality among woman . The National Institute Cancer Mexico ( lNCAN ) receive annually 500 patient CC , 80 % diagnose locally advanced disease . Furthermore , 10 20 % present kidney deterioration . The main reason kidney disease ureteral obstruction , cause include age comorbidities , diabetes hypertension . The standard treatment locally advanced disease consist concomitant chemo-radiotherapy base cisplatin ( QT-RT ) , follow brachytherapy , absolute benefit 10 % . However , use cisplatin patient renal disease may questionable , consider nephrotoxic treatment . Given renal dysfunction limit standard treatment efficiency widely know nephrotoxicity cisplatin , Cancer Centers country , patient renal dysfunction receive radiation therapy , even though proven less effective concomitant QT-RT , limit disease-free overall survival patient . Venook et al . use gemcitabine radiosensitizer patient cancer renal dysfunction . Our group , observe encouraging result use gemcitabine alternative cisplatin concomitant treatment radiotherapy , CC patient renal insufficiency . 89 % patient complete response improvement renal function , enhance creatinine clearance treatment . Therefore , necessary explore safety gemcitabine alternative treatment CC patient locally advanced disease renal deterioration . We propose clinical trial ass safety treatment gemcitabine specifically renal function patient renal deterioration . It important take consideration CC advance stage produce pain , transvaginal fetid discharge general discomfort . It also cause side effect secondary renal failure nausea , vomit , fatigue , anemia , among others . These effect significant impact quality life patient . Cancer treatment side effect , besides implication nephrostomy catheter ileostomy bag , determine deterioration quality life patient , sometimes treatment . Thus utmost importance evaluate factor could help improve quality life patient explore factor deteriorate . This clinical trial aim generate scientific evidence help make best decision concern treatment patient cervical cancer renal impairment , impact quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Gemcitabine Chemoradiotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Carcinoma Cervix Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Mexico , cervical cancer ( CC ) second frequent cause death among woman , mortality rate 4000 women/year . Concerning treatment patient , evidence benefit addition chemotherapy radiotherapy patient locally advanced CC , absolute benefit 10 % overall survival significant reduction local recurrence . Cisplatin currently standard treatment CC . Evidence support benefit chemotherapy achieve patient receive least 3 cycle cisplatin dosage 40mg/m2 weekly . The side effect cisplatin include nephrotoxicity , neurotoxicity , nausea vomiting , ototoxicity , electrolyte disturbance , hemolytic anemia . For reason , choice use cisplatin radiosensitizer require careful consideration renal function patient , prior initiation treatment . The glomerular filtration rate deteriorates age many patient comorbid medical illness compromise kidney . Gemcitabine test single agent CC radiosensitizing property . Clinical profit report along reasonable tolerance gemcitabine radiotherapy . So consider good alternative treatment management patient ureteral obstruction possible renal failure . Even though gemcitabine well tolerate , dosage patient consider caution , since specific dosage yet recommended cancer patient renal dysfunction . Our aim evaluate safety chemo-radiotherapy ( QT-RT ) concomitant gemcitabine patient locally advanced cervical cancer IB2-IVA renal deterioration . Our particular objective follow : 1 . Evaluate renal function , treatment QT-RT concomitant gemcitabine . 2 . Assess safety concomitant QT-RT gemcitabine , accord common toxicity criterion CTCEA v4.0 . 3 . Determine objective clinical response rate treatment QT-RT concomitant gemcitabine . 4 . Determine incidence percutaneous nephrostomy procedure . 5 . Evaluate clinical cabinet criterion establish protocol application percutaneous nephrostomy double J catheter impact renal function . 6 . Evaluate patient ' quality life . 7 . Determine frequency complication treatment QT-RT concomitant gemcitabine . Our aim base follow hypothesis . Patients locally advanced CC IB2-IVA renal dysfunction , receive concomitant QT-RT gemcitabine , tolerate combination glomerular filtration rate &gt; 60ml/min/1.73m2 , show limited toxicity ( Grade l-lll ) response rate least 70 % . Methods . Study design . It Phase II clinical trial , open , single-arm , national , nonrandomized , single-center ; evaluate safety gemcitabine patient locally advanced CC ( IB2-IVA ) renal dysfunction , refer National Institute Cancer Mexico ( INCAN ) . 18 patient include , cervical malignant tumor epithelial origin neck uterus , renal impairment ; candidate QT-RT . Recruitment patient perform first 12 month , follow 12 month , include 3 patient per month , complete total sample one year ( 2017-2018 ) . Treatment . Based treatment evidence best dosage gemcitabine patient adequate renal function 300 mg/m2 , prepare 0.5 liter sodium chloride 0.9 % , IV administer 30 minute weekly maximum 6 week , start first week radiotherapy soon blood count recover blood transfusion . In study design , patient receive concomitant radiotherapy use external beam release 40-50.4 Gy 20-28 fraction : 1.8 Gy/day 5 days/week , 4 6 week . Intracavitary brachytherapy add reach total EQD2 dosage ( α/β=10 ) 78-86 Gy . In case retroperitoneal para-aortic lymphnodes appear , patient treat extended field radiotherapy conventional dos . Dose adjust 75 % complete dosage case grade 3 ( G3 ) leucopenia , G3 neutropenia , G3 thrombocytopenia , G3 diarrhea , radioepithelitis , G3 non hematological toxicity . In case toxicity resolve within week , treatment application may delay two week . If toxicity persists , subsequent dos suspend patient receive radiation therapy . Acute toxicity evaluate accord CTCAE ( v. 4.03 ) toxicity criterion . When possible , chemotherapy treatment coincide radiotherapy . We make every reasonable effort ensure radiotherapy treatment continue without interruption . Use colony stimulate factor allow discretion researcher , administer within 24 hour prior treatment chemotherapy . During cycle , case , creatinine clearance measure . When anaphylaxis hypersensitivity reaction suspect , gemcitabine infusion immediately stop replaced saline solution . A physical examination include vital sign perform every 15 minute , patient 's condition improve . Airways keep free . If local reaction occurs ( hive angioneurotic edema ) , epinephrine diphenhydramine administer . In case bronchospasm , epinephrine , diphenhydramine , hydrocortisone , methylprednisolone oxygen administer . In case fever , antipyretic maneuver perform patient present tremble , dipyrone administer . Emergency treatment evaluate individualized immediate attention medic , administer treatment deem pertinent stabilize patient . The administration drug perform physician considers appropriate , however patient receive anti-cancer therapy research , participate study . Sample size calculation .
