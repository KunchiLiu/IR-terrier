	<brief_title>Phase Ib/IIa Trial Evaluate Oregovomab Nivolumab Epithelial Cancer Ovarian , Tubal Peritoneal Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test hypothesis combination Oregovomab Nivolumab improve intracellular Cancer Antigen ( CA ) 125 antigen processing elicit strong systemic CA 125-specific T cell response ; manner synergistic , safe , clinically efficacious patient relapse EOC . This open-label , single-arm , phase Ib/IIa , single-center study dose find dose expansion part . In phase Ib part , clinically recommended dos monotherapy Oregovomab ( IV 2 mg Q4W , dose level 1 ) Nivolumab ( IV 240 mg Q2W ) start dos combine use . A modified `` 3+3 '' dose find design employ , 2 low dosage Oregovomab ( dose level -1 1 mg Q4W ; level -2 0.5 mg Q4W ) specify case excessive toxicity ( define ≥ 2 dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) first 3 patient , 6 patient ) encounter dose level 1 . Three patient initially enrol dose level 1 . If 0 1 DLT observe , another 3 patient enrol dose level ; otherwise de-escalate enroll 3 patient dose level -1 . If ≤ 1 DLT observe among 6 patient , dose level 1 RDE/RP2D Oregovomab combine Nivolumab . Likewise , event de-escalation , 0 1 DLT observe low dose level , 3 patient enrolled level ; ≤ 1 DLT observe 6 patient , dose level RDE/RP2D . A minimum 6 maximum 18 patient enrol dose finding part . Approximately 14 patient enroll dose expansion part wherein receive Oregovomab RDE/RP2D , combine Nivolumab . In total , 20 patient dose find dose expansion cohort treat RDE/RP2D , include phase IIa study population . Patients follow survival post-progression treatment ( ) duration 36 month time treatment initiation ( i.e. , Week 0 36 month ) .</detailed_description>
