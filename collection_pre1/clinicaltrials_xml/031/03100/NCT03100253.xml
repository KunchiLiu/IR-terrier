	<detailed_description>New drug treatment rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) action specific molecular target ( e.g . anti-TNF ) improve prognosis patient inadequate response conventional therapy methotrexate ( MTX ) . However , approximately 50 % patient treat first-line anti-TNF discontinue treatment two year due ineffectiveness adverse event .
