	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot trial determine feasibility conduct multicenter randomize full trial evaluate antepartum prophylaxis ASA versus LMWH/ASA woman confirm APS history late recurrent early pregnancy loss . Given large sample size need adequately power large multicenter trial ass efficacy ASA alone versus LMWH/ASA , investigator first need determine possible meet minimum recruitment rate need full multicenter trial . If pilot feasibility trial successful , secondary outcome collect used analysis full multicenter trial .</detailed_description>
