	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose melphalan total marrow irradiation well work autologous stem cell transplantation treat patient high-risk multiple myeloma . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Total marrow irradiation type radiation therapy form total body irradiation may deliver focus radiation major marrow sit cancer cell reside . Giving chemotherapy total-body irradiation peripheral autologous blood stem cell transplant help kill cancer cell body help make room patient 's bone marrow new blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) grow . After treatment , stem cell collect patient 's blood store . More chemotherapy give prepare bone marrow stem cell transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) melphalan fractionate total marrow irradiation ( TMI ) condition regimen autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) patient high-risk treatment-insensitive multiple myeloma ( MM ) . ( Phase I ) II . Evaluate safety regimen dose levy assess adverse event : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course , duration . III . Evaluate safety regimen dose level assess complication include : infection , delay engraftment secondary malignancy . IV . To assess complete response ( CR ) minimal residual disease ( MRD ) rate 100 day post ASCT phase II expand cohort patient treat MTD . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess predictive value high risk feature inclusive fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , International Staging System ( ISS ) stage , gene expression profile ( GEP ) CR minimal residual disease ( MRD ) relapse free survival/progression free survival/overall survival ( RFS/PFS/OS ) melphalan TMI ( mel/TMI ) . II . To assess MRD positron emission tomography ( PET ) , next generation sequencing ( NGS ) , flow cytometry mel/TMI , prior maintenance correlation PFS OS . III . To assess descriptive fashion PFS OS follow mel/TMI ASCT . IV . Evaluate change fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( FDG ) PET pre post TMI/melphalan . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Assessment bone marrow residual damage . II . Assessment immune recovery dynamic . III . To conduct genetic profiling myeloma cell . IV . Multimodal image non-invasive assessment treatment effect bone marrow . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study melphalan TMI follow phase II study . MOBILIZATION AND APHERESIS : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour . Beginning 24 hour cyclophosphamide administration , patient receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) IV . Patients also undergo apheresis 4 hour day 10 . CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive palifermin IV day -8 , -6 , undergo TMI day -5 -2 , receive melphalan IV 30 minute day -1 . Patients undergo ASCT IV day 0 , receive palifermin IV day 1-3 , receive filgrastim SC IV day 5 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning 30 day ASCT , patient receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily .</detailed_description>
