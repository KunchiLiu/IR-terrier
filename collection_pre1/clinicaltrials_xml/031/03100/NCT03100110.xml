	<brief_summary>Individuals suffer tetraplegia result cervical spinal cord injury , brainstem stroke , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) independently perform task daily living . In many case , condition effective therapy intervention provision assistive device increase independence quality life . However , currently available device suffer usability issue limit patient caregiver . One progressive alternative strategy assistive device use brain-computer interface ( BCI ) technology translate intention signal directly sensor brain computer device action . Preclinical primate research recent human clinical pilot study demonstrate success restore function disable individual use sensor implant directly motor region brain . Other preclinical primate research demonstrate effective intention translation sensor implement cognitive region brain information complement information motor region . The current proposal seek build study test safety aspect relate implant two sensor , microelectrode array , motor cognitive region brain motor impaired human . Secondary objective include feasibility evaluation complementary sensor ability support effective assistive communication .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented diagnosis complete incomplete cervical spinal cord injury , stable neurological deficit great 1 year , ALS equivalent degree deficit . Maintain level communication , enough independently provide informed consent study . Deemed healthy surgery . Good psychological social stability . Prospective participant ALS must already advance directive regard ventilation . Live within onehour travel duration site . Presence previous certain implanted device . In opinion investigator , presence serious disease disorder could affect ability participate study . Ongoing participation another clinical trial . Individuals immunosuppressed condition typically result immunocompromise ( eg . chronic corticosteroid use , immunomodulators , chemotherapy ) . Presence clinical depression medically optimize , screen neuropsychologist team . Presence cognitive deficit , assess neuropsychologist team , would preclude completion cognitively challenging task . The participant plan move outside study radius within study period .</criteria>
