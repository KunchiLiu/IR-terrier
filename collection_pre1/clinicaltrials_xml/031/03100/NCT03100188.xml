	<detailed_description>Patient 's currently peritoneal dialysis program consider study . In order enrol , patient patient 's must significant residual renal function define renal Kt/V &gt; 1.0 . These patient consent , agreeable , participant 's dialysis prescription modify decrease peritoneal dialysis . For patient continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) , may mean less exchange 24 hour period , less exchange course week ( need perform exchange every day ) . Patients continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis ( CCPD ) modify short cycler time , also less cycle course week ( need cycler therapy every day ) . Patients need continue achieve adequate weekly total Kt/V great equal 1.7 per national recommendation clinical guideline within unit . This calculated use residual renal ( RR ) Kt/v PD Kt/V . Patients also perform monthly 24 hour urine collection urinary volume , creatinine clearance , urea clearance . Adequacy typically measure every 3 month base internal lab requirement , patient need perform adequacy measurement time prescription change . The investigator measure monthly lab per routine include albumin , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , serum phosphorus , hemoglobin . The investigator hypothesize patient well quality life ( QoL ) modify dialysis prescription less exchange less cycler time assess kidney disease quality life ( KDQOL-36 ) survey tool . The investigator believe patient high level residual renal function ( ≥ 2 mL/min ) perform few peritoneal dialysis exchange still achieve maintain adequate clearance solute appropriate volume removal . The investigator also believe maximize use residual renal function , investigator adjust peritoneal dialysis prescription decrease number manual exchange per day , decrease cycler time , possibly decrease number day dialysis week . With benefit le dialysis time exchange per day , investigator believe patient decrease `` burnout '' rate allow good QoL feel burden dialysis therapy .</detailed_description>
