	<brief_title>Safety Preliminary Effectiveness NVD-001 Treatment Low Grade Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective multi-centre , randomise , control study evaluate safety preliminary effectiveness NVD-001 treatment low grade degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis interbody fusion one vertebral segment ( L1-S1 ) . The study consist 12-month active follow-up period post-surgery subsequent 12-month passive long term follow-up . NVD-001 autologous cellular medicinal product obtain culture adipose tissue ( liposuction ) lead osteogenic cell ex vivo isolation , expansion differentiation pluripotent adipose-tissue stem cell ( ASC ) , combination allogeneic fully demineralise bone matrix 3D bone implant . Patients diagnose symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I II indication spinal fusion one vertebral segment ( L1-S1 ) sign inform consent eligible randomise either experimental group ( surgical intervention spinal lumbar interbody fusion NVD-001 ) control group ( commonly use surgical intervention spinal lumbar interbody fusion ( TLIF , PLIF , minimally invasive open approach ) one two PEEK cage ( ) fill surround locally harvest autologous cancellous bone ( laminectomy ) .</detailed_description>
