	<brief_summary>Probiotics spinal inflammatory end-plate change , so-called Modic change , randomise control study Modic change inflammatory end-plate change primarily affect low lumbar level . They associate disc degeneration , disc herniation age , see magnetic resonance image lumbar spine , X-ray . Three different type Modic change describe , type 1 , 2 3 , latter rare [ 5 ] . It show type 1 , type 2 , associate intense low back pain ( LBP ) bad LBP outcome include low rate return work [ 7 ] . In addition , inflammatory cell identify type structural abnormality [ 25 ] . Modic change may affect 20 % general population double proportion clinical population , type 1 2 equally represent [ 6 ] . The investigator estimate least 5,000 patient , refer secondary health care Denmark LBP per year , suffer type 1 Modic change . Based hypothesis infection cause Modic change , randomise clinical trial one year follow-up perform [ 16 ] . This trial document significant effect long-term ( 100 day ) broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment ( amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid ) patient type 1 Modic change . However , infection Modic change document convincingly study , almost treatment effect occur antibiotic treatment stop . As yet , study replicate . The investigator hypothesize treatment effect may cause effect gut microbiom possibly explain delay effect . Probiotics show influence interleukin patient inflammatory condition healthy volunteer [ 32 , 36 , 37 ] . The investigator therefore perform randomise trial study clinical effect probiotic type 1 Modic change well effect interleukin level . The trial design randomise , clinical , double blind , placebo-controlled trial take place Spine Center , Silkeborg Regional Hospital . Power calculation base small treatment effect effect find study result requirement include 94 patient . One-year follow-up plan . The investigator use lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( Dicoflor® ) trial , strain use several clinical study . The dietary supplement show influence relevant interleukins significantly , proven stable action safe , also pregnancy . A positive result trial may significant consequence . The perspective use probiotic instead antibiotic common disorder attractive . At time , many type 1 Modic patient Denmark western country treat antibiotic . This great concern side effect possible drug resistance development bacteria . The Technology Transfer Office Aarhus University involve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background information trial preparation The bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG anaerobic gram-positive rod among area exists part body 's normal intestinal flora . In intestine bacteria break carbohydrate form lactic acid . The bacteria tolerant low pH condition . Lactobacillus rhamnosus use industrial process milk product , medically probiotic order balance natural intestinal flora . Lactobacillus rhamnosus consider safe used pregnancy several study [ 1 , 2 ] . However , two case sepsis report use probiotic [ 1 , 2 ] , one case patient diabetes one case heart-surgery patient . Purpose In placebo-controlled randomized study - To examine whether effect prolong treatment probiotic patient prolong back pain type 1 Modic change lumbar spine . - To examine whether measured change immunological activity relation treatment , whether change relate treatment probiotic . - To examine whether type 1 Modic change transform differently magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) first year participant receive probiotic compare participant receive probiotic . Hypotheses 1 . This study able show effect 100 day continuous treatment Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG participant back pain 3 month duration type 1 Modic change . 2 . It show difference activity immune system measure Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) TNF-alpha dependent whether participant treat placebo Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG . 3 . On MRI , Modic change probiotic group often change type 1 type 2 compare control group first year . Background Modic change ( MC ) inflammatory change end plat vertebra , also know end plate edema [ 3 ] . MC occur median 6 % general population median 43 % clinical population secondary sector [ 4 ] . In patient sick leave lumbar back pain MC detect 60 % [ 5 ] . The change see MR image , X-ray [ 3 ] . MC occur frequently patient herniated disc rarely occur degenerative change discs [ 6 , 7 ] . They usually occur level L4-5 L5-S1 frequently age like degenerative change [ 6 ] . MC divide type 1 , 2 3 , latter rare . The classification base histology configuration MR image [ 3 , 7 ] . Histologically , fissure granulation end plate characterize type 1 . In type 2 destruction end plate pronounce fatty degeneration extend bone marrow . In type 3 sclerosing bone tissue , also visible x-ray , also another cause . On MRI , type 1 change low signal T1-weighted sequence high signal T2-weighted sequence , whereas type 2 change high signalling sequence . Type 3 change appear low signal T1 T2-weighted sequence [ 8 ] . In addition , so-called mixed type Modic change type 1 2 lesion . Finally , Type 1 Type 2 may occur different vertebra patient [ 9 ] . Type 2 usually see often , may also occur less frequent patient population . According literature , 40 % MC type 1 change type 2 , 20 % may disappear , 40-50 % remain stable increase size 1-2 year . Type 2 3 may remain unchanged , disappear change different type . Major change remain stable small change [ 9 ] . It show type 1 , include mixed type , result severe degenerative change [ 10 ] . In cross-sectional study MC closely associate pain degenerative change spine , particularly type 1 [ 11 , 12 ] . Patients type 1 MC often wake night pain often bother one hour morning stiffness ( inflammatory back pain ) . They also often experience pain extension [ 13 ] . There publish three study include patient type 1 MC clearly show type 1 MC associate poor one-year prognosis regard disability pain [ 7 , 11 , 16 ] , Modic change show independent risk factor severe episode back pain [ 17 ] . Other degenerative manifestation hardly seem adversely affect prognosis [ 14 ] . Finally , investigator show type 1 MC associate increase risk unsuccessful return work also adjust establish risk factor [ 5 ] . Another cohort study show prognostic significance MC probably due low prevalence MC study ( 14 % ) [ 15 ] . Previous treatment MC Since MC represent area inflammation , recommend patient MC less physically active avoid weight load [ 16 ] . However , control , prospective study show difference pain function program focusing rest , compare usual active training program lower back pain , advice longer relevant [ 17 ] . There casuistic report temporary effect treatment corticosteroid , either tablet injection disc , control study [ 13 ] . Some retrospective cohort study [ 18 , 19 ] suggest well effect back surgery patient type 1 compare patient , study suggest low rate heal [ 9 , 23 ] . There randomized prospective study subject . Infection hypothesis There evidence bacteria MC [ 20 ] , evidence increase number TNF-immunoreactive cell type 1 change compare type 2 change [ 25 ] . Some study identify bacteriae disc tissue 50 % patient underwenting surgery herniated disc , frequently Proprionibacterium acne , usually benign skin bacteria [ 21 ] . These finding lead hypothesis low-grade infection possible cause MC , since disc herniation show risk factor subsequent occurrence MC . An uncontrolled study suggest effect Bioclavid treatment [ 22 ] , commonly use drug amoxicillin clavulanic acid , commonly use exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . January 2013 , result double-blind , randomized clinical trial 1 year follow-up publish comprise 160 patient type 1 MC show efficacy treatment Bioclavid , 1 tablet twice daily 100 day . There moderate difference pain function treatment period antibiotic , increase difference intervention control group follow-up period follow 9 month [ 16 ] . The treatment duration choose pragmatically current practice patient spondylodiscitis . However , Modic patient fever elevate sedimentation rate . Included patient verify herniated disc ½ - 2 year previously , patient pain 6 month duration back pain intensity previous 2 week ≥ 6 10 . More half patient gastrointestinal side effect , serious adverse effect . The modest impact antibiotic first 100 day , subsequently pronounced effect follow-up period , give present investigator reason assume treatment effect cause antibiotic treatment , rather consequent change intestinal flora . Usually , effect antibiotic treatment infection occur rapidly . Activation immune system IL-6 marker inflammation , plasma IL-6 increase infection autoimmune activation [ 23 ] . Recent study suggest IL-6 disc degeneration play role interaction cytokine , particularly IL-1 TNF-alpha [ 24 ] , particular activation macrophage [ 25 ] . A cross-sectional study patient low back pain show association IL-6 concentration , pain poor sleep quality [ 26 ] . By measure change IL-6 level relation treatment probiotic placebo , investigator able see whether probiotic reduce overall IL-6 TNF-alpha production body increase production IL-10 . The investigator suspect IL-6 TNF-alpha decrease start probiotic treatment , increase end treatment probiotic , contrast IL-10 . Conclusion The investigator consider important clarify whether probiotic therapy clinically relevant effect disability pain patient type 1 Modic change , whether result detectable change inflammation marker modification Modic change time . A positive result may open alternative effective , low-risk low-cost treatment . Selection probiotic The probiotic product Dicoflor ® ( Pharma Force Aps ) use , contain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG , commonly use bacterial strain clinical trial . Each capsule contain 6 billion lactic acid bacteriae . The recommend dose 1 capsule twice daily . The effect dietary supplement study patient rheumatoid arthritis [ 32 ] demonstrate effect TNF-α IL-8 [ 27-29 ] . The bacterial strain use child atopic dermatitis , demonstrated effect IL-10 [ 30 ] . Furthermore , effect immune system study healthy adult [ 31 ] . Methods Design Randomized double-blind clinically control study 3 , 6 12 month follow-up 2 arm : 1 .

Setting Study participant recruit among patient refer Spine Center , Silkeborg Regional Hospital , comprise Surgical Unit ( K-RYG ) , Medical Unit ( M-RYG ) Research Unit ( F-RYG ) . After receive usual intervention Spine Center ( surgical intervention indicate ) , patient inform study give write information telephone number allow contact Research Unit , interested participate study . Most participant recruit Medical Unit take care vast majority patient Spine Center . Usually , MRI lumbar spine available referral general practitioner receive . If MRI available , usually order physician Spine Center clarify condition relate clinical finding . The usual intervention M-RYG F-RYG similar . The patient complete questionnaire . A physician , chiropractor physiotherapist , subsequently conduct clinical back examination , take medical history . The clinical issue MR image discuss physician , chiropractor physiotherapist . If need test image , order . In M-RYG F-RYG patient receive general information back pain , include general poor correlation image pain , importance exercising , general exercise training , finally psychological factor impact back pain . Considerations make whether medical pain treatment need adjustment , whether assessment surgeon consider . The MRI assess examine physician discuss affiliated physician Department Radiology Regional Hospital Silkeborg [ 32 ] . When patient receive usual intervention M-RYG , F-RYG K-RYG , Modic type 1 mixed Modic change identify MRI lumbar spine , patient tell structural change may contribute factor pain may cause pain disability prolong . The patient inform present Modic project offer opportunity participate . If patient express interest participate give write information study . The information include phone number secretary F-Ryg . The patient advise contact secretary reading information still interested . Baseline When patient phone secretary F-RYG , visit F-RYG plan finally decide whether in- exclusion criteriae fulfil . When meet F-RYG , participant-information discuss . If patient still interested exclusion criteriae , medical record clinical back examination perform . Subsequently , blood sample take . Afterwards , patient examine guided physiotherapist regard plan physical activity . If lab test normal exclusion criterion , inclusion criterion meet , consent form sign , participant include study . The physician ensure participant give proper information regard back pain general specifically relation patient 's situation . The medical pain management adjust necessary . Level function record ( self-assessed walking distance , maximum time sit , nocturnal pain ) . The mobility spine measure ( modified Schober , side bending , bend backwards ) , register whether sign nerve root compression . The patient inform possibility assessment surgeon study period , worsen improvement condition . Indications referral surgeon adheres guideline . If patient sick leave , person advise resume work possible . No case manager assign . The physiotherapist register self-rated loss functioning percent , evaluate pain response test order ensure patient appropriately inform specific exercise , exercise general `` pacing '' principle . A follow-up appointment physiotherapist arrange 14 day . Clinical data record schedule . Dispensing capsule dietary supplement / placebo After randomization , capsule hand participant blister pack , compliance record diary . The participant advise take capsule 08 18 meal , recommend save empty blister pack . The capsule recommend stored refrigerator . They also store room temperature . The capsule design placebo capsule indistinguishable active capsule . The participant advise use preparation contain lactic acid bacteria , example Paraghurt Idoform . Baseline data addition clinical finding Questionnaire data : Before clinical examination doctor physiotherapist comprehensive questionnaire complete include question back pain leg pain precede 14 day [ 33 ] , limitation function examination day [ 34 ] , possibly previous surgery herniated disc , fear avoidance , work , possibly sick leave duration , question perceive cause pain , question exercise leisure time , type housing , psychological symptom , tobacco alcohol consumption use pain medication . How question answer , previously show important prognosis [ 35 , 36 ] . Follow-up Generally : If symptom nerve root irritation occur study , participant may contact Research Unit additional clinical evaluation . After 14 day : The physiotherapist make adjustment exercise program . In addition , blood sample take . After 102 Days : The participant meet project nurse return empty blister pack , complete questionnaire ( pain , function , possibly treatment ) , blood sample take . 6 month initiation treatment project nurse record level pain function phone mail . 12 month initiation treatment participant attend new consultation include questionnaire , blood test new standardized clinical assessment . A new MRI scan order lumbar spine ass extent previously diagnose Modic type 1 change unchanged changed . After project end , MRI change describe standardized [ 38 ] baseline 1 year without knowledge clinical information intervention group ( blind description ) .

If infection bacteraemia intestinal bacteria lactic acid bacteria , medication discontinue randomization code broken . The case report Ethics Committee . Possible causality assess unblinding . Side effect possible discontinuation preparation record journal RedCap , use 'Case Report Form ' . Data analysis Data make anonymous , patient identify serial number . Calculation power Power calculation base finding placebo-controlled study [ 16 ] assumption treatment probiotic less effective treatment antibiotic . Changing median value function intervention group control group 1 year 8 1 , respectively , previously mention study . It assume , mean value different median value . The standard deviation specify article [ 16 ] , interquartiles comparable data previous study make investigator [ 5 ] . The standard deviation 6.3 study . Using standard deviation 6.5 , clinically relevant change estimate 5 instead 8 . Strength calculation make STATA [ 38 ] ( β = 0.8 , α = 0.05 ) : Requiring 42 patient group , able detect difference ' 5 ' function 1 year compare ' 1 ' control group . Assuming drop-out rate 10 % result need group size 47 . Statistical analysis Primary outcome : 1 ) The difference 1-year function baseline analyze unpaired t-test , data normally distribute , Wilcoxon 's test unpaired data , data normally distribute . Secondary outcome : 1 . Proportion minimal loss function compare Chi 2 test . 2 . And 3 ) analyze unpaired t-test Wilcoxon 's test unpaired data , depend whether data normally distribute . 4 ) To analyze Wilcoxon 's test unpaired data . 5 ) Compared Chi 2 test . 6 ) Difference number operate tested Fishers exact test , figure assume small . 7 ) Most significant change decrease increase IL-6 level respectively start treatment treatment discontinuation , test pair t-test within group unpaired t-test group , possibly Wilcoxon 's test , data normally distribute . 8 ) And 9 , 10 ) Compared Chi 2 test . An 'Intention treat ' principle use , mean randomized patient include analysis , independent compliance treatment operation necessary . In case lack follow-up data , baseline data enter ( last observation carry forward ) . A significance level 5 % use . Ethical consideration It consider consistent good ethical standard offer participation randomize trial , deal preparation usually well tolerated may efficacy , alternative prolonged antibiotic therapy , use place without risk . There good evidence patient type 1 Modic change high risk back pain patient persistent pain disability even problem return work . The latter special importance , quality life also economically , individual patient society . It estimate 20 % patient refer secondary health care type 1 Modic change , estimate least 20,000 patient referred hospital Denmark , due low back pain . This may imply therapy clinically relevant effect may offer 4,000 patient annually Denmark .
