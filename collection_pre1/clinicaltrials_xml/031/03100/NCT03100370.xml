	<brief_summary>This study compare different polarity transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation combine robotic-assisted arm training adult acquire brain injury ( ABI ) . Participants receive 20 minute 2.5 milliamps ( mA ) anodal , cathodal , sham transpinal direct current stimulation ( tsDCS ) cervical spine combine high intensity robotic-assisted arm training , five day week , 2 consecutive week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Combined Spinal Direct Current Stimulation Upper Limb Recovery Acquired Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acquired brain injury ( ABI ) lead cause neurological disability United States account poor physical health social dysfunction evident survivor . Hemiparesis due acquire brain injury primary cause disability arm paresis perceive primary cause disability individual suffer ABI limitation create perform activity daily live ( ADL ) . Rehabilitation impair limb essential improve motor function ABI , yet 31 % ABI survivor receive outpatient rehabilitation . Therefore , effective therapy upper-limb paresis must address . Approximately 80 % ABI survivor suffer upper limb paresis 18 % individual gain full motor recovery conventional treatment year follow ABI . The study use cross-over , randomize , sham control , double-blinded design 10 participant subacute chronic ABI assign receive either active anodal spinal stimulation , cathodal spinal stimulation , sham spinal stimulation experiment duration random order . In experiment participant receive robotic assist train duration 1.5 hour . The first 20 minute train couple spinal stimulation . Treatment administer intensity 5 session per week 2 week .</detailed_description>
