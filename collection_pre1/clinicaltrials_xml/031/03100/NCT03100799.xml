	<detailed_description>This exploratory non-drug , interventional , hypothesis generate biomarker study . No Investigational Product administer study , however , study relate procedure interventional arthroscopy , arthrocentesis infusion gadolinium-containing contrast agent . Consented patient meet selection criterion undergo MRI image without gadolinium contrast knee . Approximately seven day follow MRI imaging , patient undergo arthrocentesis knee obtain synovial fluid arthroscopy target knee obtain synovial non-weight bearing cartilage tissue . The patient return clinic approximately seven day follow arthroscopy arthrocentesis procedure routine safety follow-up .</detailed_description>
