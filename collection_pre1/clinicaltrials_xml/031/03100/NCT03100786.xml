	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine whether Leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ) genotype , define randomisation , determine dexamethasone 's clinical effectiveness add first 6-8 week anti-tuberculosis treatment TBM . The investigator conduct LTA4H genotype stratify , parallel group , randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled multi-centre Phase III non-inferiority trial evaluate dexamethasone versus placebo 6-8 week addition standard anti-tuberculosis drug . The investigator take hybrid trial-design approach assume modest harm dexamethasone aim prove non-inferiority placebo first also allow claim superiority placebo case dexamethasone cause substantial harm . Moreover , possible harm dexamethasone apply LTA4H CC genotype , trial allow drop CT group interim analysis continue randomization CC group . In make assessment investigator determine whether dexamethasone influence survival incidence new neurological event ( primary endpoint ) , also whether influence disability assess modify Rankin score 12 month start treatment . The secondary objective investigate alternative management strategy subset patient develop drug-induced liver injury enable safe continuation rifampicin isoniazid therapy whenever possible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leukotriene A4 Hydrolase Stratified Trial Adjunctive Corticosteroids HIV-uninfected Adults With Tuberculous Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There longstanding hypothesis death TBM result excessive intracerebral inflammatory response . The corollary hypothesis adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment corticosteroid ( e.g . dexamethasone ) improve survival , demonstrate predominantly HIV-uninfected individual small number trial . Yet corticosteroids improve survival , whether patient , remain uncertain focus LAST ACT trial . Adjunctive dexamethasone might improve outcome TBM control early intracerebral inflammatory response , reduce cerebral oedema intra-cranial pressure , may prevent potentially life-threatening complication hydrocephalus , infarction tuberculoma formation . Despite careful study participant enrol last dexamethasone trial conduct Vietnam , anti-inflammatory effect link outcome found . An explanation puzzle finding forthcoming upon subsequent discovery common functional promoter variant ( C/T transition ) gene encode leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ) , determines balance pro- anti-inflammatory eicosanoids , appear predict pre-treatment inflammatory phenotype response dexamethasone HIV-uninfected participant . In retrospective study , analyse HIV-uninfected Vietnamese adult TBM enrol earlier randomize controlled trial adjunctive dexamethasone , investigator find survival benefit dexamethasone restrict hyper-inflammatory LTA4H TT-genotype patient , possible harm suggest hypo-inflammatory CC-genotype patient . These preliminary finding suggest LTA4H genotype might critical determinant inflammation consequently adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment response . Recently , investigator extend original observation new cohort 786 prospectively characterize Vietnamese adult TBM , receive corticosteroid . In new cohort investigator find LTA4H genotype influence survival HIV-uninfected patient , infected HIV patient receive dexamethasone . TT-genotype patient significantly likely survive CC-genotype patient univariable multivariable analysis , confirm previous finding . The investigator two independent study suggest LTA4H influence pre-treatment inflammatory phenotype HIV-uninfected Vietnamese adult dexamethasone-induced survival . The investigator want conduct practice-defining RCT address hypothesis HIV-uninfected adult TBM , LTA4H genotype use select likely benefit dexamethasone . The data strongly suggest 'hyperinflammatory ' LTA4H TT genotype patient TBM benefit dexamethasone . Therefore , patient enrol trial followed-up 12 month receive open label dexamethasone first 6-8 week anti-tuberculosis treatment . The data support hypothesis adjunctive dexamethasone benefit , may cause harm , give LTA4H CT CC-genotype Vietnamese adult TBM . Therefore , participant two genotype randomise receive 6-8 week placebo dexamethasone addition anti-tuberculosis drug . The primary objective determine whether LTA4H genotype , define randomisation , determine dexamethasone 's clinical effectiveness add first 6-8 week anti-tuberculosis treatment TBM . In make assessment investigator determine whether dexamethasone increase survival reduces incidence new neurological event ( primary endpoint ) , also whether reduces disability assess modify Rankin score 12 month start treatment . The primary endpoint death new neurological event ( define fall Glasgow coma score ≥2 point ≥2 day high previously record Glasgow coma score ( include baseline ) onset follow clinical adverse event : cerebellar symptom , focal neurological sign , new onset seizure ) 12 month randomisation . The secondary objective investigate alternative management strategy subset patient develop drug-induced liver injury enable safe continuation rifampicin isoniazid therapy whenever possible . The investigator perform open , randomise comparison three management strategy aim demonstrate strategy result least interruption R H treatment . All patient enrol trial eligible take part study , exception know TBM cause isoniazid resistant MDR M. tuberculosis . Consent seek enrolment , option give patient enrol main study , 'drug-induced liver injury strategy study ' . Eligible patient randomise one three strategy : 1 . Observe : measure transaminases , bilirubin , INR every 3 day ; change/stop anti-tuberculosis drug unless transaminase rise ≥10x normal , total bilirubin rise &gt; 2.0mg/dl ( &gt; 34 µmol/L ) , INR &gt; 1.5 symptom hepatitis worsen ( nausea , vomit , abdominal pain ) , case go Strategy 3 . 2 . Stop Pyrazinamide ( Z ) alone . Observe , measure transaminase , bilirubin , INR every 3 day . If transaminase fall &lt; 5x ULN day 5 , total bilirubin rise &gt; 2.0mg/dl ( &gt; 34 µmol/L ) , INR &gt; 1.5 symptom hepatitis worsen time ( nausea , vomit , abdominal pain ) , go Strategy 3 . 3 . Current standard care ( current USA CDC guideline ) : stop rifampicin ( R ) , isoniazid ( H ) Z immediately add levofloxacin aminoglycoside ethambutol . Restart R ( full dose ) transaminases &lt; 2X ULN hepatitis symptom . If increase transaminases 7 day add isoniazid ( full dose ) stop levofloxacin aminoglycoside . If transaminase remain normal full dose R H , Z likely cause re-started treatment duration extend ≥12 month . If transaminase rise ≥ 5x ULN , ≥3x ULN symptom , time re-introduction R and/or H physician stop R and/or H ( depend associate transaminase rise ) . If neither R H use , treat levofloxacin , aminoglycoside ethambutol . If R use , H , treat R , levofloxacin ethambutol . If H use , R , treat H , levofloxacin ethambutol . The primary endpoint proportion time 60 day follow randomisation neither rifampicin isoniazid give ( subject dead ) . For example , RH interrupt 18 day participant die 48 day randomization , endpoint 50 % [ ( 18+ ( 60-48 ) ) /60 ] . Rifampicin isoniazid consider critical drug early TBM treatment ; inability use agent ( either bacterial resistance patient intolerance ) associate poor outcome . The vast majority interruption expect short one month strategy 3 ( standard care ) management strategy 1 2 delay time point interruption , long cut-off 60 day choose .</detailed_description>
