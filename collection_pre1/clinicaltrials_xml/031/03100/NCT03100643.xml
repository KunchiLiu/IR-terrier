	<detailed_description>Compared racial/ethnic group US , Black men sex men ( MSM ) , diagnose , less likely optimally engage HIV care treatment . This undermines promise prevention approach reduce disproportionate effect HIV/AIDS Black community , emphasize urgency increase research focus intervention development . Understanding HIV care engagement context dyad may part comprehensive effort address multilevel influence HIV care engagement unique HIV+ Black MSM towards achieve maximum public health benefit treatment-as-prevention . However , scarcity dyad-level research limit understand dyadic effect HIV care engagement inform intervention development . Mobile technology-based strategy ( mHealth ) offer tremendous potential acceptable , feasible , effective intervention approach enhance HIV care engagement among partnered HIV+ Black MSM several important reason : ( 1 ) Black MSM likely report primary partner participate couple-based HIV intervention ; ( 2 ) couple-based behavior ( e.g. , daily routine couple ) , within-partnership dynamic ( e.g. , trust , intimacy ) , couple serostatus ( i.e. , serodiscordant concordant-positive relationship ) understudy factor optimal HIV care engagement among MSM ; ( 3 ) mHealth show feasibility acceptability target couple-based behavior ( e.g. , money management , family planning ) general population . Moreover , mHealth offer potential address social structural barrier often experience Black MSM access engage HIV care . Therefore , aim study : ( Aim 1 ) examine mobile technology use relational factor involve HIV care engagement within context couple among HIV+ Black MSM ; ( Aim 2 ) synthesize Aim 1 finding identify intervention target behavioral change derive framework intervention enhance HIV care engagement dyadic context ; ( Aim 3 ) develop novel , mobile technology product enhance HIV care engagement context couple among HIV+ Black MSM . The end goal application development novel , theory-based , user-centered mHealth product target relationship factor dynamic important optimal HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black men same-sex relationship . Through aim , I acquire additional training necessary career development ( ) theory research method ( qualitative research method dyadic analysis ) conduct couple-based research , ( b ) formative research intervention development use group model building , ( c ) mHealth product development . These research career development activity build foundation become independent , NIH-funded investigator skill conduct couple-based intervention research use mobile health innovation part comprehensive effort HIV prevention integrate advance mobile technology behavioral medicine reduce racial/ethnic disparity HIV .</detailed_description>
