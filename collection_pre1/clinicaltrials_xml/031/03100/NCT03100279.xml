	<brief_title>Process Outcomes CBT Anxious Depressed Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study evaluate efficacy manual-based psychological therapy administer youth anxiety mood problem . It also assess role several mediator ( e.g. , cop skill , negative self-statements , parent practice ) hypothesize maintain youth anxiety depression . Youth ( age 7 - 16 ) diagnose principal Anxiety Depressive Disorder recruit receive Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) . Anxiety ( e.g. , Generalized Anxiety Disorder , Separation Anxiety Disorder , Social Phobia ) depressive disorder ( e.g. , Major Depression Disorder , Dysthymia Disorder ) among common emotional disorder affect America 's youth , 12-20 % youth meeting criterion anxiety disorder 2-5 % meeting criterion depression one point time . Both form disorder associate significant distress functional impairment school , peer , family domain . Left untreated , early affliction disorder leave individual risk adult anxiety disorder , chronic depression , substance abuse , long-term functional impairment . Identifying efficacious treatment effective , `` active ingredient '' top health research priority . In addition , knowledge psychotherapy work lags behind research document simple treatment effect . Knowing therapy technique best outcomes well know intervention produce gain provide valuable information improve already effective therapy . Two manual-based psychological treatment receive empirical support clinical trial outcome study cognitive-behavioral treatment anxious child ( Kendall 's Coping Cat ) cognitive-behavioral treatment depressed child ( Weisz 's PASCET ) . Both treatment ( ) use manual ( b ) support clinical trial outcome study youth receive manualized treatment intervention improve control group . The Kendall treatment program produce strong treatment effect yet see empirical literature child adolescent . Despite increase knowledge treatment work , insufficient analysis psychological mediator youth psychotherapy . Research psychological mediator , `` mechanisms action , '' provide information psychotherapy work . Randomized clinical trial document CBT produce clinical outcome , decrease symptoms impairment follow treatment . Fewer study assess degree cop skill , emotion management , cognitive restructuring mediate clinical gain . This type mediator analysis essential test theory underlie treatment help inform model pathology . For example , increase primary ( active ) cop skill precede reduction depressive symptom , might infer poor cop skill maintain factor depression successful therapy work increase youth 's use skill . In current study , invite youth participate CBT intervention demonstrate efficacy conduct thorough assessment potential therapy process mediator variable impact treatment outcome . Both primary ( active problem solve ) secondary ( attempts adjust situation change ) cop skill link number psychological distress state youth may specific link maintain depression youth . In anxious youth , ratio negative positive self-talk show mediate gain CBT . The role parenting practice also highlight important maintaining factor anxiety ( e.g. , model anxious behavior , parent intrusiveness ) . Self-efficacy , cognitive appraisal one 's ability manage challenge , also related distress youth . Affective component , positive affect , negative affect , physiological hyperarousal receive increased attention reflect basic emotional process underlie distinguish anxiety depressive disorder . Finally , less research identify cognitive functioning relate anxiety depression , expert encourage assessment multidimensional cognitive factor expression psychological distress enhance ability factor normative developmental process . Given , current study ass youth primary secondary coping skill , youth automatic thought self-statements , parent practice , affective process cognitive function treatment outcomes potential mediator symptom change CBT . There also minimal attempt explore therapist client factor impact within-session therapy process could improve delivery empirically-supported treatment . Process factor like client engagement therapeutic alliance may deserve particular attention youth-based therapy youth rarely refer treatment , often recognize acknowledge existence problem , frequently odds parent goal therapy . Recent empirical data suggest youth demonstrate great engagement strong therapeutic alliance may experience good treatment outcome . Therapist responsiveness child need flexibility implement manual-based therapy might also significant , indirect , effect successful treatment . A great understanding therapist , child , interpersonal factor improve delivery therapy could lead concrete recommendation train novice clinician develop improved version current therapy manual . Because treatment occur within semi-natural clinic setting , multiple baseline , single-case design use . Employing single-case design context permit continuous assessment throughout baseline treatment phase . This design provide data course sequence symptom mediator change . We also able document sequence symptom change relate introduction specific treatment intervention . The combined information provide valuable information treatment work intervention produce specific client change . II . SPECIFIC AIMS The current study attempt address follow aim : Aim 1 . Determine whether CBT anxiety depression effective natural clinic setting case exhibit great range symptom severity , multiple clinical problem , great socioeconomic cultural diversity . Effectiveness assess diagnostic , symptom , adaptive functioning domain , include executive cognitive functioning . Aim 2 . Determine youth cop skill , behavioral activation , automatic thought , affective process , self-efficacy parenting practice mediate relationship CBT intervention clinical outcome . Aim 3 . Determine youth therapist within-session process ( e.g. , child involvement , therapeutic alliance , therapist adherence treatment protocol ) moderate treatment success . Aim 4 . Determine pattern symptom change associate CBT youth ( e.g. , gradual symptom decline , presence sudden gain ) . Aim 5 . Note pattern additional youth mental health service auxiliary service family seek beyond treatment receive Youth Anxiety Depression Clinic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We expect 200 youth ( age 716 year ) primary anxiety disorder 200 youth ( age 7 16 year ) primary depressive disorder serve participant .

Youth may also participate subclinical diagnosis disorder : ( ) youth demonstrate sufficient symptom yet reach clinical level impairment OR ( b ) youth demonstrate several symptom related disorder demonstrate clinical impairment , AND ( c ) consent parent agree anxiety mood problem would appropriate clinical focus treatment . Allowing youth subclinical diagnosis allow study investigate effectiveness therapy across range clinical severity . This design model usual community care large range severity witness many youth may meet criterion formal diagnosis . After receive initial diagnostic assessment , parent must consent youth must assent continued participation study must willing receive psychological therapy Youth Anxiety Depression Clinic ( YADC ) , specialty program within outpatient clinic Rutgers University Graduate School Applied Professional Psychology ( GSAPP ) . Youth primary diagnosis DSMIV disorder anxiety depression ( e.g. , anorexia nervosa , Postraumatic Stress Disorder , Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder ) , receive diagnosis mental retardation , pervasive developmental disorder , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder exclude . Youth demonstrate suicidal ideation intent ( child parent report ) severe enough require current hospitalization , youth attempt suicide past 3 month , also exclude .
