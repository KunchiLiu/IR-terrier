	<brief_summary>Objectives : Resveratrol , non-flavonoid polyphenol , find consistently modulate cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) follow oral supplementation . Although , result subsequent predict benefit cognitive performance young healthy population . However , argue suffer reduction CBF cognition , age population , may benefit resveratrol administration . Hypothesis : The current investigation aim employ mild hypoxia experimental model age young healthy population , assess resveratrol attenuate deficit elicit reduction oxygen supply . It hypothesize resveratrol would module CBF , provide efficient supply oxygen overcome associate decrease performance cause hypoxic model . Design : This repeated measure , double blind , placebo control , balance design assess cognitive CBF effect resveratrol hypoxia ( equivalent ~2000m sea level ) normoxia ( sea level ) . Methods : 24 participant arrive fully fast ( except water ) 12 hr complete baseline measure cognitive task battery , take treatment day . Following 45 min absorption period , participant complete 3 full repetition cognitive test battery , appropriate , oxygen level alter . Changes CBF measure near-infrared spectroscopy throughout full test session .</brief_summary>
