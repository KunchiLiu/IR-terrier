	<brief_summary>In Mexico , cervical cancer ( CC ) rank second incidence mortality among woman . The National Institute Cancer Mexico ( lNCan ) receive annually 500 patient CC , 80 % diagnose locally advanced disease . The standard treatment locally advanced disease consist concomitant chemo-radiotherapy base cisplatin ( QT-RT ) , follow brachytherapy , absolute benefit 10 % . Adverse effect include gastrointestinal toxicity , important factor limit dosage pelvic radiation . Cancer treatment , modality , induces malnutrition , combine treatment administer . Radiation induce gastrointestinal toxicity cause different factor , among malabsorption bile , fat carbohydrate , decrease brush border enzyme , diverticular disease , proctitis , psychological factor . International guideline cancer patient recommend nutritional assessment patient start treatment , nutritional risk detect patient may get start dietary intervention prevent malnutrition . Several author study dietary management may help reduce gastrointestinal effect cancer patient receive pelvic radiotherapy . To reduce diarrhea prevent malnutrition recommend dietary approach low residue diet consist 20-25 % kcal fat , 5g lactose 20g fiber . Currently INCan follow nutrition care process cervical cancer patient ; write recommendation give patient list food allow allow , nutritional assessment intervention . From previous study , investigator demonstrate current recommendation help patient maintain nutritional status , treatment patient become malnourish ( 81 % , p &lt; 0.01 ) . Therefore , aim clinical trial evaluate diet low residue CC patient , consider necessary modification patient morbidity present , comparison current dietary recommendation use INCan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Low Residue Diet Comparison Dietetic Recommendations From INCan Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Mexico , cervical cancer ( CC ) second frequent cause death among woman , mortality rate 4000 women/year . Among patient attend INCan , 80 % diagnose locally advanced CC 30 % present comorbidities . Hypertension may present 20 % patient , obesity 18 % diabetes 6.8 % . These comorbidities affect efficacy treatment , increase risk malnutrition , adverse event , hospitalization , increase hospital stay worsen quality life , even increase risk death . Furthermore , 10 20 % patient present kidney deterioration . The main reason kidney disease ureteral obstruction . The glomerular filtration rate deteriorates age many patient comorbid medical illness compromise kidney . The standard treatment CC concomitant chemo-radiotherapy use cisplatin radiosensitizer , brachytherapy end treatment . Studies develop INCan describe acute toxicity symptom CC patient use treatment : nausea , vomit , diarrhea , cystitis , radioepithelitis , leucopenia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia . Pelvic radiotherapy cause gastrointestinal toxicity , important limit factor patient complete treatment . Cancer treatment , along tumor factor , cause malnutrition , confers bad prognosis patient 's response treatment survival . There nutritional risk patient moment diagnosis , metabolic alteration cause tumor , treatment-induced side effect . International guideline cancer patient recommend nutritional assessment patient start treatment , nutritional risk detect patient may get start dietary intervention prevent malnutrition . Several author study dietary management may help reduce gastrointestinal effect cancer patient receive pelvic radiotherapy . To reduce diarrhea prevent malnutrition recommend dietary approach low residue diet consist 20-25 % fat , 5g lactose 20g fiber . Currently INCan follow nutrition care process cervical cancer patient ; write recommendation give patient list food allow allow , nutritional assessment intervention . The investigator describe nutritional status CC patient undergo concomitant chemo-radiotherapy . It observe end cancer treatment , period 9 week , 81.8 % patient become malnourished ; 96 % patient lose weight , 78 % severe weight loss . The aim clinical trial evaluate diet low residue CC patient , consider necessary modification patient morbidity present , comparison current dietary recommendation use INCan . A thorough nutritional evaluation include anthropometric data , dietary data , gastrointestinal toxicity quality life evaluation , perform . Particular objective follow : 1 . Identify nutritional status CC patient , treatment chemo-radiotherapy , intervention control group . 2 . Determine association malnutrition gastrointestinal toxicity treatment , intervention control group . 3 . Evaluate quality life patient , treatment , group . 4 . Establish association nutritional status response treatment , group . The aim base follow hypothesis : Patients receive personalized nutritional intervention low residue diet maintain good nutritional status treatment , reflect few malnourished patient , compare control group . Methods . Study design . Randomized clinical trial , open , factorial 3X2 . To evaluate efficacy low residue diet nutritional status , gastrointestinal toxicity quality life CC patient refer National Institute Cancer Mexico ( INCan ) . 320 patient include , cervical malignant tumor epithelial origin neck uterus , candidate chemo-radiotherapy . Dietary intervention consist low residue diet : 20 % kcal fat , 5g lactose/day , 20g fiber/day ( 5g insoluble fiber ) . Dietary intervention adapt patient 's individual requirement , accord presence comorbidities renal deterioration . 1 . No comorbidities . Energy : 20-30 kcal/kg body weight/day . Protein : 1.3 g/kg body weight/day . 2 . Comorbidities ( diabetes , hypertension ) , geriatric patient . Energy : 25-30 kcal/kg body weight/day . Protein : 1.5 g/kg body weight/day . 3 . Renal deterioration . Energy : 30-35 kcal/kg body weight/day . Protein : 1 g/kg body weight/day . Sodium : 2000-2300 mg/day Potassium : 1900-2730 mg/day Phosphorus : 800-1000 mg/day Control group receive standard write recommendation INCan , enlist allow food allow food . Sample size . A sample space 320 patient include prior consent acquire meet inclusion criterion . This clinical trial contemplate 3 stratum 2 level . Statistical analysis . A univariate analysis perform describe study population . Descriptive statistic use obtain measure central tendency dispersion , well frequency distribution qualitative variable . Percentage change nutritional status calculate use Friedman test . Chi square test use compare basal v final assessment , chi square test use compare among study group . All confidence interval construct confidence 95 % ( α=0.05 ) . The interpretation study result responsibility researcher . Data processing analysis perform SPSS package ( version 19.0® ) Microsoft . Efficacy analysis . Efficacy evaluate patient qualify include protocol analysis . To evaluate efficacy , nutritional diagnosis clinical course analyze , intervention control , group . Also , toxicity quality life response obtain . Procedures . Treatment . Anticancer treatment consist Cisplatin radiosensitizer , dosage 40 mg/m2/week 6 week . For patient renal deterioration Gemcitabine use instead Cisplatin , dosage 300 mg/m2/week 6 week . Concomitantly , external pelvic radiotherapy apply total dosage 50.4 Gy divide 28 fraction , 1.8 Gy/day/5 day week , 6 week . After complete concomitant chemo-radiotherapy , intracavitary brachytherapy administer low dosage ( 30 Gy Cesium 137 ) high dosage ( Iridium ) . Before initiate chemo-radiotherapy , complete evaluation apply mention . Once eligibility criterion verify , patient randomly assign intervention group control group . Visits study . After sign informed consent , patient inform begin participate study ( screen visit ) .
