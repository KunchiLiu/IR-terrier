	<brief_summary>Frailty , one geriatric syndrome , consider major obstacle recovery physiological stress . Such stress impose patient cancer virtue disease even treatment . Moreover , malignancy chemotherapy cause accelerate loss muscle mass , deconditioning , frailty negative outcome . Several study show chemotherapy accelerates age . Muscle mass reserve find major predictor outcomes patient treated chemotherapy . Recently , several study suggest active muscle strength train chemotherapy may decrease side effect , improve ability deliver intend dos treatment may even affect oncological outcome . In propose study intend assess contribution physical training well-being chemotherapy treat old patient , assess molecular physiological parameter . We intend recruit lymphoma patient age 70 prospectively randomly assign intervention group ( strength , aerobic balance training chemotherapy ) control group ( standard care special emphasis physical activity treatment ) . We measure clinical outcome treatment tolerance effect well physiological outcome ( muscle strength mass , element activity daily live ) laboratory marker age DNA methylation , INK 4a expression , telomere length serum level inteleukin 6 , CRP among others . Our hypothesis physical training improve patient ' ability complete treatment few side effect , provide good daily functioning well muscle strength/function . We also hypothesize age process , show laboratory senescence marker , attenuate intervention group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Rising life expectancy exponential correlation age cancer incidence bring new field geriatric oncology . As patient age 65 account 60 % cancer diagnose octogenarian even nonagenarian rare oncology practice , geriatric prospective becomes essential treatment process . Frailty , nebulous term , define metabolic basis `` vicious circle energetic dysregulation '' , largely heterogeneous young elderly population , people frail , others borderline - '' prefrail '' even non-frail - `` fit '' . Nevertheless , frailty becomes universal senescence progress , tightly link physiological age usually worsen comorbidities . Elderly patient seem fit good health still `` sub-clinically '' frail . The clinical significance gradual loss ability cope recover physiological stress . Oncological patient expose two major physiological stress : catabolic state induce disease chemotherapy challenge tissue . Curative-intent chemotherapy usually withhold frail individual elderly patient deem pre-frail fit frequently treat accord standard mildly modify protocol , put risk slow recovery drug relate toxicity . Moreover , show study chemotherapy accelerate senescence stress relate mechanism promotes muscle loss frailty young individual . Numerous tool develop try measure frailty help treatment decision . Despite difference , main bulk evaluate element tool refer way patient 's ability perform physical activity include muscle strength , walk speed , level energy production feeling tire , emphasize critical role muscle elderly general condition . Interventions show prevent deterioration even improve physical condition frail individual muscle train nutritional support . On hand , incorporation physical training young oncological patient show improve outcome ability complete chemotherapy without dose adjustment , subjective feeling less fatigue , good daily functioning , early return work well physical measure muscle strength cardio-pulmonary fitness . The positive impact physical activity : preventing frailty deterioration ability withstand chemotherapy well , lead u hypothesis would especially beneficial elderly cancer patient . The benefit would probably expand beyond clinical functional measure would also express molecular level reduce level senescence marker . We intend prospectively recruit lymphoma patient age 70 , admit Davidoff Cancer Center outpatient clinic judged eligible chemotherapy 75 % full dose . The patient randomly assign intervention control group . All patient undergo similar evaluation begin completion chemotherapy . Standard evaluation patient : - anthropomorphic measure ( hand grip hand-held dynamometer quadriceps strength sit tensiometer ) , functional measure ( gait speed 6 minute-walk , sit-to-stand test , functional reach time get-up-and-go test ) - perform physiotherapist day recruitment one two month chemotherapy completion - muscle mass accord muscle mass index calculation cross section area psoas muscle level L3 vertebra correct height ; body composition accord mean Housfield unit psoas section area - do study physician , use CT scan beg treatment - functional , nutritional cognitive function perform routinely Senior Oncology Program Davidoff Cancer Center - do begin treatment team member - standard blood test include hemoglobin , white blood cell , albumin , CRP drawn treatment - marker senescence measure treatment completion : DNA methylation three select locus , expression p16INK4A , telomere length plasma level IL-6 CRP - marker `` inflamm-aging '' - process chronic low-level inflammation universal old individual . - After standard part evaluation physiotherapist , patient schedule another appointment taught set exercise include strength training upper low limb ( elastic band weight , rise chair climb stair ) , fitness work ( brisk walking ) balance exercise , recommend senior sport program . - Patients provide printed instruction explain recommended exercise , diary fill , day number repetition specific train element check accord compliance . Patients also equip pedometer ask record count regularly - Patients meet physiotherapist follow start every chemotherapy course ( 3-4 week ) contact phone twice weekly assure stick training recommendation The control group receive standard treatment follow-up special emphasis physical activity . The size group 50 patient . Innovation To best knowledge , prospective study publish kind intervention elderly cancer patient . Home-based physical training simple , low-cost modality , , proven effective , would appreciably improve patient-related outcome probably reduce short long-term cost patient care . There study explore difference cellular senescence elderly cancer patient undergo physical training . Study design This prospective randomized study , intervention blind do . The cross-sectional comparison group longitudinal change search . Statistics The statistical analysis data perform statistician Rabin Medical Center use SPSS software accord accepted standard .</detailed_description>
