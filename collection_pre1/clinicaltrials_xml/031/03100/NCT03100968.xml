	<brief_title>Utility Ultrasound Identification Midline Placement Epidural Severely Obese Parturients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use ultrasound expand many area medicine include identification bony landmark facilitate epidural placement obstetric anesthesia . Using ultrasound epidural placement become popular last decade several study publish topic . The likely increase popularity ultrasound use obstetric population need reliably locate bony landmark traditional palpation technique show inaccurate way accomplish . Given fact long-taught palpation technique inaccurate study validate use ultrasound epidural placement , ultrasound technique routinely teach obstetric anesthesiologist anesthesiology resident UAB . Also , since technique consider standard practice UAB , anesthesia provider ( resident , fellow , faculty ) free choose either technique locate bony structure back prior epidural placement . Since current study specifically address use obese pregnant patient , investigator would like validate use population . In study , investigator evaluate use ultrasound obese population determine use decrease time take place epidural number attempt require compare traditional palpation technique . The study also determine success rate epidural placement palpation ultrasound group .</detailed_description>
