	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Studies Acute Hypoxic Hyperoxic Breathing Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Molecular oxygen ( O2 ) constitute 21 % air people breathe sea level . But humans safely expose somewhat low high concentration oxygen . The varying amount oxygen enter body modulate oxygen available tissue , ultimately lead change redox balance metabolism . The investigator recently develop non-invasive MRI-based technique quantify redox balance ATP generation brain . These process think abnormal people psychiatric disorder . In study , investigator aim manipulate concentration oxygen breathe air 2 separate MRI scan consecutive day ( 16 % 26 % ) . The investigator anticipate healthy individual demonstrate change brain redox balance metabolism response modulation .</detailed_description>
