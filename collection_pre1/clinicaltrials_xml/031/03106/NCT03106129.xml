	<detailed_description>Over prescription opioids currently National epidemic . There call action address problem urgently anesthesiologists well position participate lead research educate medical practitioner prescribe optimal dose ultimate goal improve patient 's safety . Total knee arthroplasy ( TKA ) total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) may result significant sustain postoperative pain . For optimal pain control , fast recovery , good functional rehabilitation , patient prescribe opioids addition analgesic adjunct hospital discharge hospital . This practice stem much evidence demonstrate propensity moderate severe pain 52 % 16 % respectively 30 day post discharge patient undergo THA TKA . These patient prescribe opioids upon discharge hospital control pain enhance optimal rehabilitation . The discharge prescription often base surgeon 's judgment past experience . Furthermore , 50 % patient may receive suboptimal pain control result pain early postoperative period . On hand , recent study show opioids often over-prescribed . This practice result significant financial cost , also represent potential reservoir opioid misuse abuse . In Canada , rate dispense high-dose opioid formulation ( great 200mg morphine equivalent per day ) increase 23.0 % , 781 unit per 1000 population 2006 961 unit per 1000 population 2011 .

This may contribute either over-dosing opioid related side effect , under-dosing inadequate analgesia rehabilitation . In prospective observational study plan determine mean amount opioid require post discharge TKA correlate good pain management rehabilitation outcomes . The mean amount opioid consume could use future guide physician practice proper opioid prescribe post discharge hospital .</detailed_description>
