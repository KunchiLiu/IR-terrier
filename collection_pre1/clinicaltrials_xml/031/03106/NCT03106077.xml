	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn mirvetuximab soravtansine help control either newly diagnose metastatic ( spread ) triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . Mirvetuximab soravtansine design stop cell growth block certain protein cancer cell related mineral folate . This believe cause cancer cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirvetuximab Soravtansine Localized Triple-Negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 2 cohort study . If metastatic TNBC , Cohort A . If newly diagnose TNBC , Cohort B . Study Drug Administration : On Day 1 21-day cycle , receive mirvetuximab soravtansine vein 2-3 hour . If tolerate study drug , dose may lower stop . Length Study : If Cohort A , may receive mirvetuximab soravtansine long study doctor think best interest . If Cohort B , may receive mirvetuximab soravtansine 4 cycle . After 4 cycle , surgery part standard care . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If become pregnant , part routine blood sample urine collect pregnancy test . You come back clinic Day 2 Cycles 1-3 . At visit , vital sign collect study doctor study staff check health . On Days 8 15 Cycles 1-3 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . During even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) : - You image scan . The study doctor tell type scan . - If doctor think need , eye exam . End-of-Treatment Visit : As soon possible last cycle study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test - If doctor think need , eye exam . - You image scan . - If Cohort B , core tumor biopsy check status disease . If Cohort B , surgery part standard treatment . Follow-Up : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If perform end-of-treatment visit , image scan . - If become pregnant , part routine blood sample urine collect pregnancy test . You continue image scan every 12 week 1 year first dose study drug . If disease get bad start new anti-cancer therapy , scan stop . This investigational study . Mirvetuximab soravtansine FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain answer question study drug design work . Up 57 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

( For Cohort A ) Archived tissue available prescreening confirm FR alpha+ breast cancer . 5 . ( For Cohort A ) Archived tissue available prescreening confirm FR alpha+ breast cancer . ( For Cohort B ) Confirmed FRalpha+ breast cancer define high FRalpha expression : =/ &gt; 75 % cell =/ &gt; 1+ expression , moderate FRalpha expression : 25 % 74 % cell =/ &gt; 1+ expression . 6 . ( For Cohort A ) Measurable disease per RECIST . ( For cohort B ) Clinical radiologic primary tumor size least 1.5cm prior enrollment onto protocol 20140185 ( ARTEMIS ) . Primary tumor least 1.0 cm evidence continue lymphnode involvement imaging ( ultrasound MRI ) Adriamycinbased neoadjuvant therapy . 7 . ( For cohort B ) : primary tumor sample collect NACT start ( ARTEMIS ) underwent molecular test integral biomarkers include immunohistochemical assessment FRalpha . 8 . ( For cohort A ) : two prior therapy metastatic disease . ( Relapse disease within 6 month adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy consider 1 line therapy metastatic disease ) . ( For cohort B ) : receive least one dose anthracyclinebased NACT . Patients eligible therapy discontinue due disease progression therapy intolerance . Patients disease progression anthracyclinebased therapy evaluate surgical team . If patient deem inoperable time evaluation , patient may continue undergo protocol therapy goal reduction tumor size become operable . If patient deem high risk become inoperable surgical team base upon tumor size location , patient consider ineligible study recommend go surgery . 9 .
