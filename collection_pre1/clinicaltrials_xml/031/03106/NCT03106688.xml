	<brief_summary>The goal project characterize neural psychological mechanism contribute development obesity early adulthood . We address neuromolecular risk factor obesity use multi-modal molecular ( positron emission tomography ) functional ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) neuroimaging prospective design . Normal weight adolescent high versus low familial , genetic psychological risk factor obesity study followed five year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diet , nutrition , physical exercise critical factor maintenance good health entire life course . However , western country annual increase prevalence severity obesity physical inactivity substantial . Early detection individual high risk obesity important , reverse obese state difficult . To prevent treat obesity , necessary characterize neural mechanism support alter incentive motivation food intake , build comprehensive model interaction neural , physiological , psychological factor contribute development maintenance obesity . This obviously call novel data analysis technique allow fusion analysis neurobiological , physiological , behavioural data , well screen critical combination biomarkers obesity . A total sixty male ( 30 normal-weight , 30 risk develop obesity ) recruit prospective study . The subject undergo physical examination , physical fitness test , physical activity measure , body tissue composition measurement , structural functional magnetic resonance image brain body ( MRI &amp; fMRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) ligands [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose ( [ 18F ] -FDG ) , [ 18-F ] FMPEP , [ 11C ] carfentanil . Subjects ' weight physical condition follow 5 year . In three interconnected work package ( WPs ) test three hypothesis derive human animal study : 1 . Altered reward cognitive control function brain predisposes individual overeat obesity . 2 . Opioid system reward circuit function provide feasible biomarkers obesity risk . 3 . Mobile track behavioural paradigm tap reward learn inhibitory control use unobtrusive inexpensive detection risk factor obesity . These study improve understand neural psychological mechanism obesity addictive disorder . This knowledge translate crucial knowledge develop novel risk factor screen procedure , novel pharmacological psychological treatment obesity .</detailed_description>
