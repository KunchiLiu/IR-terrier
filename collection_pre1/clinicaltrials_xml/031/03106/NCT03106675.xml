	<detailed_description>Clinical Background Bone metastasis give rise major complication lead significant morbidity impairment life quality . The common primary bone metastasis prostate , lung breast carcinoma . These three high cancer incidence USA 85 % prevalence bone metastasis time death . Pain osseous lesion related mechanical chemical factor . Pressure effect periosteum adjacent neural structure cause local radiating pain . Hemorrhage local bone osteolysis osteoclastic activity cause local release bradykinin , prostaglandin , histamine substance P irritate endosteal nerve well local nerve . The life expectancy patient osseous metastatic disease variable substantially long patient multiple myeloma , breast prostate cancer . Therefore , find effective local therapy improve patient quality life do single outpatient sit would beneficial . Current Treatment Bone Metastases The current emerging treatment osseous metastasis may consider several category : radiotherapy , systemic chemotherapy ( cytotoxic , hormonal radionuclides ) , surgical stabilization percutaneous tumor ablation . These treatment may apply isolation also frequently combination . External beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) one main treatment osseous metastasis . Radiation therapy create effect destroy local tumor inflammatory cell responsible cause pain . Although effect radiotherapy palliate pain control osseous metastatic disease well established. , significant relapse rate within patient survive least 12 week . Also pain relief often suboptimal lead supplemental persisting medication . Thus , `` net pain relief '' le goal pain relief total duration life treatment . Also , limit much radiation give , constitute problem clinical oncology care . Chemotherapy variable effect bone metastasis related number neoplasm , drug patient related factor . Newer systemic treatment radionuclides bisphosphanates show success . More recently , development recombinant osteoprotegerin anti-parathyroid hormone-related protein monoclonal antibody represent promise new option treatment patient bone metastasis . However , number important factor consider potential side effect treatment unanswered question regard optimal use systemic agent : treatment begin , long must treatment continue , optimal dose schedule achieve clinically meaningful anti-tumor effect ? Surgical therapy essential certain instance mechanical strengthen necessary impending occur pathological fracture little role palliative therapy due invasiveness potential complication associate . Therefore , effective modality local treatment bone metastasis could substantially improve quality life . More recently , percutaneous procedure local tumor ablation radiofrequency ablation cryotherapy show promise treatment metastatic bone lesion . MRI Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) completely non-invasive technology thermal ablation . HIFU capable concentrate ultrasonic pressure wave specify region without physical penetration body . The converge ultrasonic pressure wave convert thermal energy specific depth , result local heating focus . Temperature elevation proportional proton resonance frequency shift , therefore MR image provide accurate technique target definition energy deposition control . MRI guide Focused Ultrasound therapy perform treatment uterine leiomyoma ( fibroid ) . Recently method gain AMAR authorization FDA approval , CE approval indication . Technical background : MR-guided intervention Since first report MR-guided biopsy 1986 increase interest MR-guided intervention . Technical barrier , inaccessibility patient image lack MR-compatible instrument ( needle , scissors , etc . ) largely solve . Today majority MR-guided intervention make conventional closed-bore scanner alongside diagnostic imaging . Also , MRI guidance cost effective approach perform minimally invasive procedure many case replace invasive in-patient base procedure . New Possibilities : integration MR image therapy Until recently , control destructive energy deposition unresolved problem tumor treatment . One great potential MRI monitoring delivery various destructive energy . Thermal monitoring particularly important application interventional MRI . Thermal ablation technique require good localization target also quantitative spatiotemporal control energy deposition , turn require monitor thermal change result tissue alteration . Hyperthermia base slight temperature elevation ( 41° C ) , require relatively long homogenous thermal treatment solid tumor . The main assumption hyperthermia malignant cell higher sensitivity thermal damage normal one . The temperature sensitivity various MRI parameter ( T1 , diffusion , chemical shift ) exploit detect temperature change within critical temperature range . Compared hyperthermia , thermal surgery use temperatures 55-60° C , short period . Above 55-60 °C , protein denature , result thermal coagulation cause irreversible tissue damage . Appropriate MRI sequence demonstrate normal margin surround thermal lesion , temperature elevation still low cause cell necrosis , , importantly , differentiate tissue phase transition . Since MRI enable monitoring , new possibility emerge interstitial laser therapy , cryo- RF-ablation high-intensity focus ultra¬sound treatment different tumor . High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) The ability ultrasound image modality guidance minimally invasive procedure show various disorder moreover , significant potential produce coagulation necrosis expose tissue high-power focused sonication . By focus high-power ultrasound beam distance source , total necrosis tissue lie within focal volume achieve without damage structure elsewhere path beam . Since diagnostic ultrasound image sensitive enough guide focus ultrasound thermal therapy , MRI use guide intervention . MRI thermometry base temperature-dependent proton resonance frequency show accurately reflect thermal change tissue . Currently , two type HIFU-methods clinically use : point-by-point ablation volumetric ablation , latter consider energy-efficient . Clinical trial HIFU bone metastasis indicate method safe give effective reduction patient pain . The short- long-term effect tumor volume morphology seem evaluate thus far . Objectives study MRI guide HIFU utilized effect treat metastatic bening bone tumor . However detailed information upon treatment effect pain , tumor volume systemic immunological process lack , prospective study upon issue . Furthermore , randomize study compare HIFU therapy radiation therapy . There data upon HIFU therapy plan utilizing therapy planning software . The primary objective trial evaluate effectiveness MRI guide HIFU treatment metastatic bone tumor : - Safety : To evaluate incidence severity adverse event associate MRI-HIFU therapy use novel cool technique . - Effectiveness : To determine effect MRI-HIFU treatment metastatic bone tumor . Efficacy determine level pain relief ( measure Visual Analog Scale ; VAS ) , decrease analgesics/opiate improve quality life ( measure SF36 questionnaire , Finnish ) baseline 24-Weeks post HIFU treatment . This study design prospective , two arm , nonrandomized study ( Where one arm consist HIFU group RT group ) . Later wider randomize two arm study compare outcome HIFU RT could execute . Furthermore , study follow `` International Bone Metastases Consensus Working Party '' endpoint measurement future clinical trial establish 2012 conjunction American Society Therapeutic Radiology Oncology ( ASTRO ) , European Society Therapeutic Radiology Oncology ( ESTRO ) , Canadian Association Radiation Oncology ( CARO ) ( Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys . 2012 Apr 1 ; 82 ( 5 ) :1730-7. doi : 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.008 . Epub 2011 Apr 12 . ) Specific Objectives : 1 . Pain relief . The change patient pain relief assess Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , whereas treat patient quality life assess quality life questionnaire . These assessment perform baseline , treatment day , follow time point . 2 . Additional data regarding dosage frequency analgesic consumption management metastatic bone tumor induce pain also collect . 3 . Effect systemic immunological process , tumor marker cytokine monitor via repeat blood sample . 4 . Relative Safety evaluate use common description Significant Clinical Complications patient treat study . This study perform either 1.5T 3T MR scanner . 5 . Temporal effect HIFU tissue observe longitudinal imaging . The ultimate goal project establish multidisciplinary mini-invasive environment use 3 T MR imager integrate high-intensity focus ultrasound . Eventually , year come , goal develop clinically validate MR-guided HIFU-interventions place potential treatment option clinical perspective , i.e . regard cost , morbidity rate outcome follow disorder - metastatic bone disease - cortical intra-articular osteoid osteoma - solitary aggressive ( giant cell tumor ) malignant ( plasmacytoma ) lesion Patient selection pre -and postoperative imaging In first phase , include patient intractable pain despite proper analgesic radiotherapy treatment . These patient three bone metastasis plan treatment , source pain unambiguously localize metastasis consider sonicated . As preliminary study , anatomic location relatively easily accessible , i.e . metastasis locate pelvic region , shoulder extremity . Exclusion criterion include disease diffusely spread bone , source pain localized metastasis . Also , close proximity major nerve artery consider exclusion criterion . Other contraindication include ASA-class great II , anesthesia procedure require , allergy MRI contrast medium anesthetic agent . MRI unit , HIFU-system sonication . As novel image guide therapy platform 3-T scanner ( Ingenia , Philips Healthcare , Best , The Netherlands ) utilize completely non-invasive MRI guide High Intensity Focused Ultrasound platform ( Sonalleve , Philips Healthcare , Vantaa , Finland ) perform study treatment . The high intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) tabletop harbor 256- element phase array HIFU transducer ( focal length 140 mm , operate 1.2 MHz ) . The system different ellipsoidal treatment volume cross-sectional diameter 2 12 mm . The patient preparation include preferably concise sedation e.g . phentanyl midazolam . However , optimal pain relief always individual , base mutual agreement patient anesthesiologist specialize pain relief . After pre-sonication MR imaging , target volume define radiologist , thermal effect assess vendor provide pulse-sequences ( fast-field echo echo planar image ) enable proton resonance frequency shift ( PRFS ) MR thermometry method . The temperature reach 55 degree volume order achieve thermal coagulation cause irreversible tissue damage . Current status work The magnet sonication instrumentation instal early 2016 , currently MRI use clinical examination HIFU therapy uterine myoma ( fibroid ) .
