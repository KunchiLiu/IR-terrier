	<detailed_description>This project double blind randomized cross-over control ( pilot ) trial investigate whether combination Aquamin ( calcium-rich marine multi-mineral ) polyphenol-rich pine bark extract ( Enzogenol ) , take food supplement 3 month ( 12 week ) comparable superior benefit glucosamine sulphate patient painful knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) . From refer Aquamin 's combination product Aquamin-plus . The main outcome measure reduction pain ( WOMAC index ) improve physical function ( 6MWD TUG ) . The hypothesis study consumption Aquamin-plus period 3 month comparable superior effect glucosamine sulphate reduce pain improve physical function individual KOA . According Food Drug Administration et al . osteoarthritis ( OA ) define serious disease condition , among aspect , `` …associated morbidity substantial impact day-to-day functioning… '' . Furthermore , current Osteoarthritis Research Society International ( OARSI ) definition OA propose , `` OA disorder involve movable joint characterize cell stress extracellular matrix degradation initiate micro- macro-injury activates maladaptive repair response include pro-inflammatory pathway innate immunity . The disease manifest first molecular derangement ( abnormal joint tissue metabolism ) follow anatomic , and/or physiologic derangement ( characterize cartilage degradation , bone remodeling , osteophyte formation , joint inflammation loss normal joint function ) , culminate illness '' The condition characterize branch rheumatic disease progressive condition synovial joint cause failure joint repair follow damage . This damage may cause stress due abnormality articular cartilage , subchondral bone , ligament , meniscus , periarticular muscle , peripheral nerve synovium . Failure normal biological process lead breakdown cartilage bone characterize symptom pain , stiffness , functional disability lead negative effect fatigue , mood , sleep overall quality life . OA high frequency rheumatic diseases one prevalent chronic disease modern day . According Global Burden Disease ( GBD ) study , progressive age population could make OA ninth cause disability-adjusted life year ( DALYs ) develop country year 2020 , KOA account 83 % total OA burden . Investigations heritability OA identify interesting result . In British twin cohort , genetic contribution radiographically define hip KOA estimate 39-65 % woman Danish twin study find similar variance hip arthroplasty due OA ( 47 % ) 18 % knee arthroplasty due OA . However , recent data large cohort ( n = 9058 ) show heritability 73 % 45 % hip knee arthroplasty , respectively . Interestingly , identify hip OA associate arthroplasty remain highly heritable regardless environmental factor , genetic component KOA ( arthroplasty ) significantly modifiable increase BMI . These data show requirement clinical intervention focus symptomatic KOA , particularly consider exponentially increase BMI obesity western world . Data The Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing ( TILDA ) show approximately 13 % ( women-17.3 % , men-9.4 % ; self-reported ) Irish residence age 50 suffer symptomatic OA , 19.2 % reporting symptomatic KOA . These similar data Arthritis Research UK show 18 % prevalence patient visit general practitioner present symptom KOA . Moreover , report incidence rate estimate raise tandem population age ( Arthritis Research UK , 2013 ) . In fact , prevalence KOA US 25 % increase 2 % year , likely due age population ( UK ) raise obesity rate , lifetime risk symptomatic KOA high 60.5 % obese individual . Joint pain common complaint among seek medical care OA result OA pain 80 % individual degree movement limitation , 25 % perform major activity daily live 11 % adult KOA need help personal care . Consequentially , OA lead negative effect quality life , mood , fatigue sleep . Interestingly , poor sleep occur ~70 % old individual OA link fatigue , turn associate great fall risk elderly identifies fatigue concern , addition joint instability , fall-related complication . OA progressive condition cure , however treatment exist aim reduce symptom slow progression disease . This turn improve mobility , quality life lead reduction need joint replacement surgery long-term consequently reduces demand healthcare resource . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) traditional approach clinical management mild-to-moderate OA symptom , however NSAIDs associate potentially harmful side effect gastrointestinal complication , renal disturbance cardiovascular event . Therefore , non-pharmaceutical alternative develop glucosamine compound , however report efficacy reduce OA symptom varies . Nonetheless , glucosamine compound low risk adverse effect compare NSAIDs symptomatic slow-acting drug OA ( SYSADOA ) , glucosamine compound show high risk adverse side effect placebo alternative seek . Further possible adverse health effect , NSAIDs SYASDOAs costly greatly affect socioeconomic health patient OA . A recent meta-analysis global generalize OA show individual annual incremental healthcare cost range €705 €19,715 conclude social cost OA could 0.25 % 0.50 % country 's GDP . More specifically , individual cost KOA ( social healthcare private ) range €528 €11293 depend severity . In fact , Hunter et al . recently call urgent action focus attention opportunity reduce individual socioeconomic burden OA . Glucosamine supplementation treatment OA OA relate phenotype span many decade , first ( author ' knowledge ) patent fill 1969 research human derive glucosamine publish long . The early identifiable mention ( author ' knowledge ) Aqumin late 90 's patent , contain Aqumin , fill human consumption 2003 , `` Algae-based food supplement '' . Therefore , significant advantage glucosamine accumulation large high quality study therapeutic effect . Nonetheless , small pilot study concern therapeutic effect Aquamin supplementation show promising result comparison placebo Glucosamine formula . In fact , important OA phenotype , Aquamin perform good , particularly reduction NSAID use . While propose mechanism action differ considerable two supplement , inflammatory reduction occurs . Currently , long-term trial concern efficacy Aquamin reduction KOA relate joint structural decline however , Aquamin reduce inflammatory marker KOA , albeit one small human study , possible Aquamin might improve joint structural decline KOA prognosis possibly reduce joint tissue damage . This project double blind randomized cross-over control trial sample size 30 participant ( base sample size calculation detail ) . The project investigate two supplement effect self-reported pain , quality life , knee extensor/flexor strength , knee extensor/flexor myoelectric activity , functional mobility biomarkers associate inflammation . The participant first assess baseline measurement outcome measure mention . They randomly allocate either group A B take either supplement A B period 12 week . Following follow assessment outcome measure . This follow 4-week washout period prior subject ' baseline measure reassess participant allocate 'other ' supplement . After 12 week ' supplementation , subject retested final time . An priori sample size calculation indicate total 29 patient require enter two-treatment crossover study assess primary outcome . The probability 80 percent study detect treatment difference two-sided 0.05 significance level , true difference treatment 12.000 unit . This base assumption within-patient standard deviation response variable 15.62 . ''</detailed_description>
