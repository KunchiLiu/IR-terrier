	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect third-generation Calcium Channel Blocker ( CCB ) , manidipine , compare second-generation Calcium Channel Blocker ( CCB ) , amlodipine , development peripheral edema use Direct Segmental Multi-Frequency Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( DSM-BIA ) method patient mild moderate essential hypertension . Investigator expect study could show objective evidence well safety manidipine compare amlodipine peripheral edema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manidipine Versus Amlodipine Patients With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers ( CCBs ) one commonly use potent antihypertensive agent . Their vasodilatory effect associate Adverse Effects ( AEs ) peripheral edema , headache flushing . The incidence peripheral edema Calcium Channel Blocker ( CCB ) 6 % recent systematic review clearly dose-dependent common woman , obese elderly hypertensive . Peripheral edema could cause poor persistence therapy antihypertensive treatment withdrawal deleterious impact health-related quality life . A recent meta-analysis head-to-head trial compare efficacy safety profile manidipine amlodipine show significantly good safety manidipine : Relative Risk ( RR ) adverse event 0.69 ( 0.56-0.85 ) , particularly ankle edema Relative Risk ( RR ) 0.35 ( 0.22-0.54 ) . Although peripheral edema important issue Calcium Channel Blocker ( CCB ) treatment , technique ( e.g , ankle-foot volume use water displacement measurement , plethysmography , pretibial subcutaneous tissue pressure ) objective measurement generally available clinical setting . Most clinical study rely self-report peripheral edema reliable objective method . Recently , Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA ) become increasingly popular estimate body composition , include Extracellular Water ( ECW ) Intracellular Water ( ICW ) , fat mass fat-free mass . Mechanistically , Calcium Channel Blocker ( CCB ) -related peripheral edema likely due distal arteriolar dilatation capillary leak tissue space . Because BIA method measure edema ratio Extracellular Water ( ECW ) Total Body Water ( TBW ) , may reflect Calcium Channel Blocker ( CCB ) -related edema . Moreover , Direct Segmental Multi-frequency Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( DSM-BIA ) validate assess segmental body ( i.e. , trunk , arm legs ) composition addition total body composition provide segmental edema score well total edema score . This new , previously report method expect provide objective precise data peripheral edema .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female outpatient age 20 80 year uncomplicated essential hypertension eligible . Inclusion criterion require patient either stage I stage II hypertension ( mean sit systolic Blood Pressure ( BP ) 140179 mmHg , diastolic BP 90109 mmHg ) . The patient newly diagnose know hypertensive subject take antihypertensive agent last 4 week . Patients exclude study evidence clinically significant concurrent medical condition include cardiac , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , endocrinologic disease . Patients also exclude know hypersensitivity serious drug reaction Calcium Channel Blockers ( CCBs ) , evidence prior deep vein thrombosis , lymphatic disease , concurrent requirement medication could affect Blood Pressure ( BP ) salt water retention ( e.g , nonsteroidal antinflammatory drug , estrogen contain drug ) .</criteria>
