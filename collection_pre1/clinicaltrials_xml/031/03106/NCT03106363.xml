	<brief_summary>Alcohol cannabis two widely use substance abuse world psychoactive substance often find seriously fatally injured driver . In recent study , observed individual report drive influence alcohol ( DUIA ) influence cannabis ( DUIC ) experience collision risk nearly 4 time individual report drive use one drug . Recent research United States Canada indicate prevalence DUIC among young driver high school university age , young adult similar , high , prevalence DUIA . This serious public health issue , since motor vehicle collision lead cause death age group . Given frequency alcohol cannabis consume together , important understand combine effect driver behaviour . The residual 'hangover ' effect substance road safety also well understood , may substantial . To date , residual effect combine use examine . The current study examine acute residual effect moderate dose cannabis ( 12.5 % THC ) combine intoxicate amount alcohol ( BAC=0.08 ) drive simulator performance young driver . Following eligibility screen practice session , total 70 participant age 19 25 year complete 8 experimental session ( 2 sessions/week ) . During first session week , subject drink alcohol placebo alcohol smoke active placebo cannabis cigarette . The effect alcohol cannabis performance driving-related skill assess use high-fidelity driving simulator . Cognitive , psychomotor , mood effect also assess . Twenty-four hour alcohol/drug exposure , subject attend second session week driving-related , cognitive , psychomotor , mood effect assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study pursue follow primary aim : Aim 1 : Examine residual effect moderate dose cannabis ( 12.5 % THC ) combine intoxicate amount alcohol ( BAC=0.08 ) drive simulator performance young driver . Simulated driving performance , test cognition , verbal memory , mood measure concurrently level cannabinoids alcohol metabolites biological fluid approximately 24 hour follow acute drug exposure male female driver age 19 25 . We test hypothesis performance high-fidelity drive simulator task significantly impair 24 hour follow dose cannabis dose alcohol comparison placebo condition . Aim 2 : Examine acute effect moderate dose cannabis ( 12.5 % THC ) combine intoxicate amount alcohol ( BAC=0.08 ) drive simulator performance young driver . Simulated driving performance , test cognition , verbal memory , mood measure concurrently BAC level cannabinoids biological fluid acute drug exposure male female driver age 19 25 . BAC biological fluid measure 5 hour follow drug exposure . We examine relationship BAC cannabinoid level performance measure time frame . Aim 3 : Explore effect drive history , drive attitude , individual difference measure ( e.g. , demographic , drug alcohol use , etc . ) acute residual effect alcohol cannabis driving simulator performance young driver . Exploratory analysis undertaken determine acute residual effect cannabis plus alcohol driving simulator task influence measure . Study Design Duration This study within-subjects , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , counterbalance , randomize clinical trial assess impact alcohol cannabis combine driver behaviour . Although placebo condition part study , treatment study . Initial contact potential subject make via telephone , study personnel conduct telephone screen eligibility . Upon eligibility confirmation telephone , participant ask attend CAMH eligibility assessment . Subjects attend CAMH total 10 study session ( eligibility assessment , practice day , 8 test day ) . Participants come lab four test week ( Sessions 1-8 ) comprise two session week . Each week participant undergo one alcohol cannabis exposure condition : 1 ) placebo alcohol placebo cannabis ; 2 ) intoxicate dose alcohol placebo cannabis ; 3 ) placebo alcohol active cannabis , ; 4 ) intoxicate dose alcohol active cannabis . The order condition randomly assign . Each week first session session participant complete alcohol manipulation follow cannabis manipulation ( Sessions 1 , 3 , 5 7 ) . Each week second session complete approximately 24 hour alcohol cannabis exposure session measure residual effect ( Sessions 2 , 4 , 6 8 ) . The alcohol cannabis exposure session separate 7-15 day . Participants ask use cannabis 72 hour alcohol 48 hour prior attend CAMH . In certain instance , Qualified Investigator may ask participant return re-screening , e.g . repeat urine test assessment perform eligibility assessment . Also , case unforeseen delay schedule study participation , Qualified Investigator determine need ask participant repeat assessment , e.g. , physical examination .</detailed_description>
