	<brief_summary>This protocol concern implementation evaluation intervention design realign exist cadre Community Health Workers ( CHW ) Neno District , Malawi good support care need client serve . The propose intervention 'Household Model ' CHWs assign household , rather HIV TB specific patient , train provide support wider range condition include HIV , hypertension , diabetes , pediatric malnutrition . The new model design improve retention care client chronic , non-communicable disease , along increase uptake woman 's health service treatment pediatric malnutrition , sustain high retention rate client HIV program . Eleven sit ( health centre hospital ) arrange six cluster estimate size catchment area population , population range 11,680 26,260 average population 20,400 . The order intervention roll across site randomize intervention evaluate stepped-wedge cluster randomize control trial . These cluster group base mostly geographic location also catchment area size , order maximize feasibility training CHW team overload CHW training session many trainee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective household model program : 1 . Timely case find education screen common , treatable condition ; 2 . Linkage care symptomatic client along qualify routine screening ; 3 . Ongoing support accompaniment patient care , include adherence support , psychosocial support , track miss patient visit ( NCDs , chronic care , Antenatal care , postnatal care ) ; 4 . Health education common health condition prevention management condition optimize prevention , health service uptake , health management behavior household . All CHWs Neno reassign trained Household model stagger rollout two year . The maximum number trainee per group cap 60 participant , training occur two group CHWs per catchment area . CHWs receive 4 5 day foundational training , follow half-day refresher training quarter . CHW training evaluate following tool : training attendance count ; CHW knowledge assessment ; CHW skill assessment ; CHW refresher assessment ; overall training dashboard . The implementation new CHW model design may evaluate step wedge , cluster-randomized trial ( SW-CRT ) . The stepped-wedge study design select number reason . First , train CHWs need stagger due training capacity constraint . Second , sit Neno receive intervention . And third , step wedge RCT design permit estimation causal effect intervention . Eleven intervention site cluster six group base population size group manageable number CHWs train . The order implementation six site randomize third party . In SW-CRT study design , cluster cross control intervention group group receive intervention . The primary outcome : - HIV : % enrolled client visit IC3 last 3m - NCDs - Hypertension : % enrolled client visit IC3 last 3m - Asthma : % enrolled client visit IC3 last 3m - Diabetes : % enrolled client visit IC3 last 3m - Epilepsy : % enrolled client visit IC3 last 3m - Mental Health : % enrolled client visit IC3 last 3m - Malnutrition : % child five enrol care moderate severe pediatric malnutrition - Hypothesis : n't expect change case cure - Tuberculosis : % total population diagnose new confirm TB case - Women 's Health : Family Planning : % WCBA long-term family planning method - Antenatal Care : - % woman start ANC within first trimester The secondary outcome : - HIV : - % client initiate ART last year visit last 3m - % infant attend 10w EID visit - % population test HIV - Malnutrition : % child age 6m-59 discharged cure SFP OTP ( cure rate ) - Tuberculosis : - % TB case complete treatment successfully ( loss follow death ) - Women 's Health : - Family Planning : - % woman child bear age receive modern family planning method - % woman child bear age newly initiate family planning Antenatal Care : - % expect pregnant woman ANC care - % number woman cohort attend 4+ ANC visit - CHW retention % CHW retain entire intervention period Descriptive Statistics : - Measure Facility Performance % facility offer woman 's health service daily basis - % month facility stock RUTF ( ready-to-use-food malnutrition ) - Average number stock day per month per facility combination , adult TB medication . Stock out measure run balance facility 's stock card zero . - Average number stock day per month non-communicable disease care two satellite pharmacy several key drug Outcomes Data To measure outcomes list , collect data : 1 . Ministry Healthâ€”monthly report collect facility enter electronic database call DHIS2 2 . Partners In Health Medical Record capture patient-level HIV NCD data . 3 . Short , semi-structured qualitative interview purposively select sample CHW program recipient . The study design step wedge randomize controlled trial . However , unlike typical trial type , data collect aggregate cluster level rather individual within cluster . As , specify model cluster-time cell mean . In addition , primary outcome proportion people , therefore specify model log control population size transform whole real line make linear model appropriate .</detailed_description>
