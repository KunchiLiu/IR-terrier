	<brief_title>Case Management HCV Infected PWID</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus infection ( HCV ) nowadays one leading cause chronic liver disease , prevalence liver cirrhosis still increase . The hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) primarily transmit blood-to-blood contact . In Western world , overall prevalence HCV antibody low . In Belgium , prevalence HCV general population estimate around 1 % expert opinion . This opinion base prevalence study Beutels et . al , publish 1997 , result 2012 report Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center ( KCE ) . However , high-risk population prevalence HCV increase . Data HCV antibody prevalence Belgium show rate 60-80 % people inject drug ( PWID ) . Populations increase risk HCV infection include : - PWID - recipient infect blood product invasive procedure health-care facility inadequate infection control practice ( western world : 1992 ) - child bear mother infect HCV - people sexual partner HCV-infected - people HIV infection - prisoner previously incarcerate person - people use intranasal drug - people tattoo piercings Based international guideline , Belgian Association Study Liver ( BASL ) recommend targeted screen population assess HCV prevalence . This yet execute Belgium , despite severe health economic burden accompany chronic hepatitis C virus infection ( CHC ) . In response lacuna Belgium health care , `` Hepatitis C Plan ( 2014-2019 ) '' develop . This action plan aim improve follow goal : - Uptake screen high-risk population - Creation national systematic screening procedure - Development HCV expertise network improve care linkage-to-care Furthermore , April 2015 federal government Belgium distribute pact pharmaceutical industry , call `` The Future Pact '' . This pact industry government focus accessibility care , specifically high-risk group . Goals create national registry therapy develop patient support program , next expansion reimbursement therapy HCV infection fibrosis stadium II . However , despite international guideline despite strategic aim Hepatitis C plan Future Pact , specific action describe , screen systematically execute high-risk group Belgium . The importance screening underestimated HCV curable , success rate 60-100 % accord associate factor ( e.g . use direct acting antiviral ( DAAs ) , severity liver disease , HCV genotype , resistance ) . Furthermore , different study state treatment patient CHC early stage potential cost-effective , hospitalization cost development liver disease far exceed cost antiviral therapy . Nonetheless , treatment uptake also remain low . One reason PWIDs exclude treatment past stigmatization base great risk reinfection . Latest study show low rate reinfection among PWID , even continue injection drug use treatment . In review meta-analysis Aspinall et al . pool HCV reinfection risk 2.4 per 100 person year , combine six study , across UK , Australia , Netherlands Greece , suggest HCV treatment withhold due concern reinfection alone . However , ongoing risk behaviour , current guideline recommend monitor annual HCV RNA assessments.Furthermore , data National Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database show increase significant minority PWID continue inject post-SVR intensity lead either hospitalisation death increase risk reinfection . Thus , harm reduction counsel remain necessary . With trial , investigator want evaluate possible approach reach different goal define Hepatitis C plan future pact . The investigator study impact case management outcome care HCV infect PWID Belgium .</detailed_description>
