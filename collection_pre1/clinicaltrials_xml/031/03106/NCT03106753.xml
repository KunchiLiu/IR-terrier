	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine best way optimize success external cephalic version ( turn baby outside ) . Attempting turn baby in-utero recommend may decrease risk need cesarean section abnormal presentation . While study team know procedure effective , study team still un-answered question best way perform procedure increase chance success . Many prior study show use spinal anesthesia ( shot medication place back numb relax abdomen ) increase success rate version . This ultimately lead find use anesthesia decrease rate cesarean section . However , small number study assess success rate spinal anesthesia use event without fails . Therefore study team go compare patient receive spinal anesthesia receive spinal anesthesia procedure turn baby ( ECV ) fail without .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Success External Cephalic Version Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breech presentation occur approximately 3-4 % term pregnancy lead one common indication cesarean delivery . Attempting external cephalic version ( ECV ) significantly increase chance cephalic presentation time delivery reduces chance cesarean section ( 1 ) . Since ECV fact reduce rate cesarean section , many study seek determine best method perform procedure optimize chance success . A recent meta-analysis conclude administration neuraxial analgesia significantly increase success rate ECV also increase incidence vaginal delivery ( 2 ) . However , 2 prospective study randomize trial evaluate success ECV use neuraxial analgesia initial attempt without fail ( 3,4 ) . Therefore , study team design randomize control trial two group : Group 1- patient receive spinal anesthesia immediately versus Group 2- patient attempt ECV without spinal anesthesia reattempt use spinal first attempt fail . This study conduct labor delivery Mount Sinai West hospital . Patients present labor delivery term ECV approach enrollment consent part study would randomize group . ECV attempt delivery neonatal outcomes collect . Patients likely enrol study time version ( approximately 37 week ) postpartum . This study take approximately 1-2 year give ECV rate .</detailed_description>
