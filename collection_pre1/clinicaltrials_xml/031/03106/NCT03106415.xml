	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study best dose pembrolizumab binimetinib well work give together pembrolizumab treat patient triple negative breast cancer spread part body . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Binimetinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving pembrolizumab binimetinib may work well treat patient triple negative breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Binimetinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) binimetinib combination pembrolizumab . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) binimetinib combination pembrolizumab patient unresectable locally advanced metastatic triple negative breast cancer Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability binimetinib combination pembrolizumab . II . To evaluate ORR immune-related RECIST criterion ( irRECIST ) . III . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) , duration response ( DoR ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) RECIST irRECIST . IV . To assess overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess correlation ORR , progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) baseline and/or change tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) . II . To assess correlation ORR , PFS , OS baseline and/or change immune relate gene signature PDJ amplification . III . To assess change immunoregulatory cell ( IRC ) . IV . To assess change cytokine profile . V. To assess change circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study binimetinib follow phase II study . Patients receive binimetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 course 1 day 1-21 course 2 subsequent course . Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Course 1 equal 14 day . Courses 2 beyond repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
