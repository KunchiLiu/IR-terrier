	<brief_summary>The Zika infection viral disease transmit human mosquito transmits Dengue Chikungunya fever . The Zika virus find various body fluid urine , blood semen , know long persists fluid . For example , part virus report persist semen six month onset symptom , know virus stay longer . In way , want investigate long Zika virus find secretion besides blood urine . Study Hypothesis : ZIKV shed human body fluid long time acute infection . Persistence ZIKV different body fluid may vary due influence circulate specific ZIKV IgM IgG , well host environmental factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Persistence Zika Virus ( ZIKV ) Body Fluids Patients With ZIKV Infection Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little known Zika virus ( ZIKV ) biology pathogenesis human . ZIKV detect blood , urine , semen , cerebral spinal fluid , saliva , amniotic fluid , breast milk . In ZIKV infected individual , virus detect blood several day one week onset symptom also find persist long urine semen . Without granular understand kinetics ZIKV infection across biologic compartment difficult devise rational measure prevent transmission virus . This observational cohort study men woman , age 18 year , include symptomatic participant positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) test blood and/or urine symptomatic asymptomatic household/sexual contact positive RT-PCR blood and/or urine . Specimens collect pre-established interval test ZIKV RNA RT-PCR blood , semen , vaginal secretion , oral fluid ( saliva crevicular fluid ) , tear , sweat , urine , rectal swab , menstrual blood breast milk ( applicable ) . Participants recruit collaborate clinic select location high population density , high circulation virus , strong community network , service laboratory facility capacity perform necessary test . All participant follow 12 month , assess detectability long time interval , reactivation reinfection . Analyses antibody response , include circulate immunoglobulin M G ( IgM IgG ) , perform parallel RT-PCR test . Plaque reduction neutralization test perform specimen participant find simultaneously positive ZIKV dengue . Specific analysis perform determine socio-demographic characteristic , comorbidities co-infections influence persistence virus body fluid .</detailed_description>
