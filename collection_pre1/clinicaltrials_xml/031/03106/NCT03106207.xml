	<detailed_description>People severe morbid obesity often fail lose weight long term . Gastric bypass consider gold standard surgical treatment obesity . Despite high success rate gastric bypass short long term , little know possible anatomopathological change occur patient . UGE use wide scale complementary evaluation patient submit bariatric surgery . However , still consensus use image test UGE follow-up patient surgery . Considering importance gastric bypass treatment obesity , knowledge possible preoperative postoperative GI alteration identify endoscopy patient may contribute establishment correlation symptomatology success rate technique follow-ups 12 month . Organization infrastructure : This study organize base single location : Kaiser Clinic Day Hospital . This center renowned treatment disease area Gastroenterology , Proctology General Surgery . Objectives : General : Demographic , clinical , nutritional , operative endoscopic data assess . Specific : The objective research investigate preoperative postoperative endoscopic change patient undergo gastric bypass without ring . Patients Methods : Thirty obese patient different region country surgical indication Roux-en-Y gastric bypass study prospectively . Patients meet inclusion criterion invite participate , agree , sign Informed Consent Forms . The procedure perform patient give write consent . Clinical evaluation patient Clinical history : Patients question frequency intensity symptom . Commonly used medication note well drug use symptomatic relief ( number tablet ) . Any urgent/emergency event ( emergency room visit and/or hospital admission ) investigate . Other clinical event also record . Physical examination : A physical examination ( general gastroenterological ) perform routinely patient participate study . Procedures pre- post-procedure phase : Patients submit UGE gastric bypass surgery without ring . All change relate esophageal body , distal esophagus stomach analyze . Biopsies perform distal esophagus ( two fragment 4 cm esophagogastric transition ) , gastric body ( anterior posterior wall ) , incisura angularis gastric antrum ( large small pre-pyloric curvature ) . Furthermore , biopsy perform lesion detect esophagus stomach . All patient submit UGE two , six 12 month surgical procedure . The follow perform postoperative endoscopy : 1- The mucosa esophageal body study , biopsy distal esophagus ( two fragment ) small curvature ( two fragment ) perform gastric pouch width anteroposterior diameter length small curvature evaluate ; 2 - shape gastrojejunal anastomosis evaluate maximum diameter measure 3 - jejunal loop study relation mucosal change afferent loop size angulation . All exam perform Kaiser Clinic patient fast least eight hour sign informed consent form UGE . With patient left lateral decubitus position , 10 % xylocaine spray instill follow 50 mcg fentanyl EV 5 mg midazolam EV . After sedation , Olympus CV 180 endoscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) introduce orally . The image obtain transfer Olympus EVIS EXERA II processor connect computer unit ZScan 5 program ( Zscan Software Ltda , Goi√¢nia , Brazil ) . When patient regains level consciousness , release company responsible adult . Postoperative clinical evaluation : After hospital discharge , patient return outpatient follow-up include clinical evaluation endoscopy exam . Clinical visit schedule follow : Visit 1 - 2 month ; Visit 2 - 6 month ; Visit 3 - 12 month Clinical complication / adverse event / clinical outcome : For patient , possible clinical complication promptly check principal investigator .</detailed_description>
