	<brief_title>Trial Anti-PD-1 ( Nivolumab ) Bladder Cancer Patients Recently Treated With Intravesical BCG Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 14 day ( 2 week ) . If participant find eligible take part study , participant receive nivolumab vein 60 minute Day 1 Cycles 1-3 . Length Study : Participant may receive nivolumab 3 cycle participant 's schedule surgery . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up visit ( describe ) . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1-3 visit participant 's surgery : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant ask complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaire . These take 10 minute complete . - If participant become pregnant , urine part routine blood sample used pregnancy test . Surgery ( Cystectomy ) : About 8 week participant join study , participant surgery bladder cancer . Participant sign separate consent form describe surgery risk . Follow Up : About 4 week surgery : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant ask complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaire . This investigational study . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treat metastatic ( spread ) melanoma non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) disease gotten bad receive platinum-based chemotherapy . The use nivolumab study consider investigational . Up 10 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
