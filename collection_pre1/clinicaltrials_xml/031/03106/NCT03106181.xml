	<brief_summary>Glaucoma common cause irreversible blindness world . Treatment centre around lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) typically include medication ( least invasive ) , laser , surgery ( invasive ) . The gold-standard glaucoma operation trabeculectomy . Whilst effective lowering IOP , associate potentially devastating complication include bleb leak , hypotonous maculopathy , blebitis endophthalmitis . In recent year , minimally- invasive glaucoma surgery ( MIGS ) become increasingly popular option treat mild moderate glaucoma . It usually perform conjunction cataract surgery . The iStent ( Glaukos Corporation , California , USA ) one commonly utilised MIGS device world one two Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) - approve MIGS device Australia . The iStent Inject® second generation iStent device Australia one first country world access . So far publish randomise control trial compare effect cataract surgery alone combine cataract surgery insertion iStent Inject® . This study aim recruit patient Glaucoma Investigative Research Unit ( GIRU ) Royal Victorian Eye Ear Hospital ( RVEEH ) mild moderate glaucoma due undergo cataract surgery randomise either cataract surgery combine cataract surgery iStent Inject® insertion . Only patient meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion recruit . The outcomes measure study comparison : 1 ) extent IOP reduction ; 2 ) reduction number topical glaucoma medication ; 3 ) patient treatment satisfaction - two treatment group .</brief_summary>
