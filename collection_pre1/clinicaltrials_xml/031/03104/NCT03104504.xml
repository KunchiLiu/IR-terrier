	<brief_title>A System Safety ( SOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The System Safety ( SOS ) project catalyze expand exist effort transform suicide risk detection suicide prevention across UMass Memorial HealthCare system ( UMMHC ) , large healthcare system central Massachusetts represent catchment area 1.06 million people . This effort span emergency department , inpatient , primary care setting ; engage medical behavioral health clinician ; target adult child ; support integration collaboration across entire system provide 360-degree safety net patient risk suicide . Building previous ongoing work , Zero Suicide 's Seven Essential Elements Care ( Essential Elements ) foundation innovative continuous performance improvement ( CQI ) hub-and-spoke model whereby central System Hub work Local Hubs Spokes represent set clinical unit . SOS evolve three phase . Phase 1 ( month 1 - 12 ) start emergency department across four UMMHC hospital ; Phase 2 ( month 13 - 30 ) extend effort inpatient medical psychiatric unit ; , Phase 3 ( month 31 - 48 ) expand primary care setting . Overall , 39 clinical unit engage . Consistent central CQI tenet Zero Suicide model , create protocol use best-practice approach identify , assess , managing , intervene suicidal patient tailor approach particular clinical unit 's unique need population . Units learn one another regular collaborative work session , retreat , cross departmental sentinel case review suicide suicide attempt . Fidelity key component protocol measure . We use stepped wedge design cluster randomization clinical unit , stratify setting . Within set ( Phase ) , study population consist patient see clinical unit pre-specified observation period ( Control ) ( Intervention ) unit 's implementation start date . We follow estimate 310,000 patient 1st encounter clinical unit 6 month Phase 3 end ( month 54 ) . Our Aims ass effect SOS intervention target ( clinician behavior ) patient outcome , use system-level analytic strategy . The Specific Aims : Aim 1 : Examine impact SOS intervention clinician-administered , standardized suicide risk screen suicide risk identification across setting clinical unit . H1 : Likelihood clinician-administered standardize suicide risk screening ( intervention target ) time patient enters study increase monotonically time since study initiation . H2 : Likelihood suicide risk identification ( patient outcome ) time patient enters study increase monotonically time since study initiation . H3 : The increase likelihood screen identification attributable SOS implementation . Aim 2 : Examine impact SOS suicide relate outcome across setting clinical unit . H4 : As SOS implement across setting clinical unit , likelihood receiving best practice suicide prevention intervention clinician ( intervention target ) increase among newly identify at-risk patient . This include , limited , collaborative safety planning , mean restriction counseling , post-acute care follow-up telephone call within 24 hour discharge . H5 : SOS implementation decrease likelihood suicide , suicide attempt , suicide-related emergency require acute medical attention ( patient outcome ) among newly identify at-risk patient . H6 : `` Dose '' exposure SOS mediate effect SOS note H5 . Exploratory Aims : We also evaluate SOS different perspective : A : Exploring potential moderating mediating factor , potential mechanism action , : EH1 : Supportive organizational characteristic ( e.g. , embed behavioral service site , provide regular clinician-level performance feedback ) promote high adherence SOS implementation . B : Exploring population level effect SOS subgroup UMMHC patient constitute Accountable Care Organization ( ACO ) . For example , hypothesize : EH2 : Suicide-related outcome measure entire ACO population level ( encounter clinical unit study period ) decrease monotonically study period ( 3-month increment ) . C : Exploring cost-effectiveness SOS intervention compare usual care . We hypothesize EH3 : The cost SOS &lt; $ 50,000/ quality-adjusted life year save , commonly use threshold .</detailed_description>
