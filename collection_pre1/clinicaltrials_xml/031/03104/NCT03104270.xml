	<brief_summary>Despite recent introduction novel anti-multiple myeloma ( MM ) agent , high risk MM remain poor prognosis therapeutic challenge . Elotuzumab ( ELO ) humanize monoclonal antibody recognize CS1/CD139 , molecule highly express MM cell . The ELO ( 10 mg/kg ) , lenalidomide ( LEN ) dexamethasone ( DEX ) combination achieve high overall response rate ( ORR ) long progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient relapsed/refractory disease ( RR ) MM impair renal function . However , efficacy MM patient high risk characteristic still unknown . Pomalidomide ( POM ) recently approve immunomodulatory agent ( IMiD ) produce response rate high-risk RRMM patient use combination DEX agent , include proteasome inhibitor ( PI ) bortezomib ( BTZ ) . POM also demonstrate activity LEN refractory patient . Carfilzomib ( CFZ ) potent second generation PI show efficacious IMiD BTZ refractory patient well high risk patient carry cytogenetic abnormality . In study , investigator propose evaluate efficacy safety ELO combination POM , DEX CFZ high-risk RRMM patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Study High Risk Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , open label , nonrandomized study six patient safety lead-in cohort evaluate efficacy safety elotuzumab combination pomalidomide , carfilzomib dexamethasone among high risk relapse refractory multiple myeloma patient ( See Figure 1 : Study SchematicFigure 1 : Study Schematic , overview ) . This study enroll previously treat patient currently show evidence progressive disease , diagnose high risk multiple myeloma ( see Section 5.1 ) . Thirty-nine patient enrol study . First , six patient enrol used lead-in cohort safety evaluation MTD re-determination ( necessary ) . The result safety lead-in cohort evaluate 6th patient complete one full cycle treatment . Recruitment patient withhold safety data analysis . Enrollment remain 33 patient contingent upon safety committee 's decision . The study consist : 1 ) screening period ; 2 ) eight 28-day , treatment cycle ; 3 ) final assessment occur 28 day end last treatment cycle ; 4 ) follow-up period . All drug administer 28-day cycle schedule throughout study . Dosing drug administration phase 2 study summarize Table 4Table 4 . Subjects eligible study receive treatment study drug maximum eight 28-day treatment cycle . Subjects treat 8 cycle therapy without demonstrate PD . Drug Dosing Administration : Elotuzumab : During cycle 1 2 study , ELO administer intravenously ( IV ) 10 mg/kg , week , day 1,8,15 22 28-day cycle . A step-wise decrease ELO infusion rate follow : 1 ) cycle 1 dose 1 : infusion time 2h 50min step-wise increase infusion rate ( 0.5mL/min 2 mL/min ) ; 2 ) cycle 1 dose 2 : infusion time 1h 13min step-wise increase infusion rate ( 3mL/min 4mL/min ) ; 3 ) cycle 1 dose 3 4 : infusion time 53min infusion rate 5 mL/min ; 4 ) cycle 2 beyond : infusion time 53min infusion rate 5 mL/min . On cycle 3 beyond , ELO give 10 mg/kg day 1 15 ( every week ) 28-day cycle infusion 53 minute infusion rate 5mL/min . Pomalidomide : POM capsule administer per Orem ( PO ) 3 mg daily day 1-21of 28-day cycle cycle . Carfilzomib : Carfilzomib give IV infusion 30 min 20 mg/m2 day 1 2 cycle 1 27 mg/m2 day 8 , 9 , 15 16 cycle 1 , day 1,2,8,9,15 16 28-day remain seven cycle . Premedication consist dexamethasone ( IV ) administer least 30 minute , 4 hour carfilzomib infusion . Dexamethasone : On cycle 1 2 , patient pre-medicated 28 mg dexamethasone administer PO morning day ELO infusion day 1,8,15 22 . Additionally , patient give 8mg IV dexamethasone day ELO infusion 45-90 minute prior start infusion day 1,8,15 22 cycle 1 2 . On day 1 15 cycle 3 beyond , dexamethasone give PO 28mg morning day IV 8mg 45-90 minute prior start ELO infusion , whereas day 8 22 , dexamethasone give 40 mg PO day morning . On Days 2 , 9 16 , DEX 4mg IV give patient least 30 minute 4 hour CFZ infusion . If infusion reaction observe , dexamethasone premedication day 2 , 9 16 could drop , reinstated sign infusion reaction subsequent administration carfilzomib . First six patient enrol study use safety lead-in cohort , safety primary criterion discontinue therapy first cycle . Patients follow combination drug regimen describe Table 4Table 4 . After 6th patient complete 1 full cycle treatment , recruitment patient withhold safety data analysis perform evaluation safety committee , continuation study contingent upon safety committee 's decision . If dialysis require , drug administer PO ( pomalidomide ) IV ( Dexamethasone , Elotuzumab Carfilzomib ) dialysis .</detailed_description>
