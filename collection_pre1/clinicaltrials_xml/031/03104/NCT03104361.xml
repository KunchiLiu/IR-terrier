	<detailed_description>Background : Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) debilitate chronic disease unknown etiology characterize urgency frequency suprapubic pain full bladder . Current treatment usually unsuccessful completely eradicate bladder pain increase bladder capacity . Autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) grow popularity therapy augment wound healing , speed recovery muscle joint injury , enhance recovery surgical repair . PRP extremely rich growth factor cytokine , regulate tissue reconstruction study extensively among trauma patient trauma experimental model . Tissue regeneration improve local application autologous bone marrow derive progenitor cell PRP . Aim : This clinical trial attempt use autologous PRP treatment interstitial cystitis refractory currently available medical treatment intravesical therapy . The result study might provide clinical evidence novel therapeutic regimen treatment IC/PBS . Setting : Department Urology , Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital . Materials Methods : A total 30 patient IC/PBS fail conventional treatment least 6 month enrol study . A diagnosis IC/PBS establish base characteristic symptom cystoscopic finding glomerulations , petechia , mucosal fissure hydrodistention . All patient treat least two type treatment modality include oral PPS , intravesical instillation heparin , hyaluronic acid , tricyclic antidepressant least 6 month symptom remain unchanged relapse . All patient IC symptom least 6 month , proven grade 1 diffused glomerulations cystoscopic hydrodistention ( HD ) within recent 1 year without Hunner 's lesion . Eligible patient admit treatment . The patient receive intravesical injection 12ml PRP ( extract 50ml patient 's whole blood ) follow cystoscopic hydrodistention intravenous general anesthesia operation room . The procedure repeat every one month total four treatment . Blood ( 10ml ) urine sample ( 30ml ) collect intravesical PRP injection 4 , 12 24 week PRP injection . Assessment : Primary end-point change O'Leary-Sant symptom score ( include ICSI ICPI ) baseline 6 month first treatment day . Secondary endpoint include VAS , daily frequency , nocturia FBC record 3-day voiding diary , Qmax , vided volume , PVR global response assessment ( GRA ) . Four visit require baseline screening ( first treatment ) ( V1 ) , 1 month first treatment ( V2 , primary end-point ) , 4 week fourth treatment ( V3 ) , 24 week first treatment ( V4 , secondary end-point ) . Urine sample collect time-point NGF cytokine test . Bladder biopsy perform baseline 6 month first treatment day possible . Adverse event include UTI , AUR , large PVR ( &gt; 150ml ) , dysuria micturition pain record</detailed_description>
