	<brief_summary>A recent French study conduct general population north , use 12,000 people randomly draw electoral list , show prevalence nearly 15 % obstructive spirometric function disorder ; The diagnosis ignore 70 % case . If consider Finist√®re situation , mortality data unfavorable , excess COPD mortality compare French average . Compared frequent chronic condition , high blood pressure diabetes , management COPD may appear complex least two reason : - Screening difficult banality symptom need spirometry confirm diagnosis ; - Comorbidities mask respiratory pathology ; It first point concern difficulty screen project focus . It true development screen strategy COPD subject numerous study , result controversial . The target population smoker age 40 , readily select , difficult achieve whole use care far homogeneous . Many people general practitioner . Recent review COPD screen recommend systematic screening COPD adult . However , emphasize feasibility screening questionnaire / portable spirometry . A selection patient suspect exacerbation ( patient least one episode label `` bronchitis '' ) could increase cost-effectiveness screen focus severe case . In France , High Authority Health ( HAS ) , inspired work WHO ( GOLD program ) , offer simple five-question questionnaire available online healthcare professional order facilitate indication screen spirometry , propose approach combine symptom identification active smoking . General practitioner first line approach diagnosis : fact , HAS , guide `` pathway care patient COPD '' , recommend general practitioner carry spirometric screening . The corresponding pulmonologist intervenes course complete exploration optimize management , especially patient frequent exacerbation . This ideal scheme hamper present practical organization , minority general practitioner ( 10 % ) practice multidisciplinary health center , place organization functional respiratory measurement easy . The current recommendation smoke cessation allow cod management . It global , applicable primary care . It propose start point minimal advice , associate medicine assistance stop , cognitive-behavioral therapy prolong follow-up patient wean . However , although comprehensive management technique effective smoking cessation , show underutilized routine practice health professional low patient participation rate . This noticed , whereas application minimum board alone would allow 200 000 people access wean every year . In complementary way , performance functional respiratory test active smoking patient propose full-fledged tool wean assistance process . Analysis literature , however , yield discordant result . Two recent study revive debate : highlight potential spirometry communication medium context smoking cessation ( use pulmonary age ) confront patient discovery understanding ventilatory disorder obstructive . Finally , health care provider invite participate actively screen , include pharmacist , place screen strategy less value . In particular , pharmacist dentist require provide care patient little use general practitioner : screening COPD among patient deserves consideration . Similarly , nurse occupy special place , call particular carry regular care patient , office home . The administration injectable antibiotic context exacerbation unlikely COPD frequent care opportunity , may include comprehensive approach . Finally , physiotherapist , increasingly trained concept respiratory rehabilitation , take charge potentially COPD smoker pathology . Based willingness Finnish actor work COPD pathway help regional health agency , investigator propose question respective place health care professional involve primary care among potentially COPD patient : Dentists , nurse , general practitioner , physiotherapist pharmacist</brief_summary>
