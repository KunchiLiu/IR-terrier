	<brief_summary>Carbohydrate-based product influence post-prandial glycemic response differently base ability digest , absorbed affect rise plasma glucose . Pasta one major carbohydrate-rich food consume Italy . Studies literature describe low glycemic response consumption pasta compare wheat-based product , bread . Among factor affect post-prandial glycemia consumption carbohydrate-based product , technological process represent central one . In fact , different technological process alter food matrix affect post-prandial metabolism glucose insulin differently . Thus , present study aim investigate effect induce principal step process pasta production reduction post-prandial glycemic insulinemic response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pasta Bread Prepared With Durum Wheat Semolina : Effect Post-prandial Glucose Insulin Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The different glycemic response consumption carbohydrate-based product associate different rate digestion absorption carbohydrate human body . Therefore , food product rich carbohydrate classify base ability digest , absorbed affect post-prandial glycemia . Epidemiological study suggest follow diet include carbohydrate-based food induce low slow glycemic response associate reduce risk develop non-communicable disease ( type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease ) , control inflammatory status , trigger several pathology , reduce fast insulin . Depending food composition , low glycemic response always associate low plasma insulin concentration . For instance , high protein lipid concentration food matrix demonstrate induce low post-prandial glycemic response , reduction insulin secretion . Avoiding high insulin post-prandial response consumption food represent preventive factor risk overweight hyperlipidemia , type 2 diabetes , cancer . Therefore , evaluation glycemic insulinemic post-prandial response curve necessary order demonstrate true beneficial effect consumption low glycemic index food . Among several factor influence post-prandial glycemic insulinemic response ( macronutrient composition cook process ) , technological aspect food produce represent important one . Several study report low glycemic response consumption pasta compare bread , due technological structure characterize two matrix . Pasta one major source carbohydrates consumed Italy . Therefore , aim present study investigate effect pasta bread plasma response glucose insulin , well c-peptide order clearly discriminate different biological effect induce technological process production pasta , compare food begin ingredient . Moreover , study aim create solid basis future study evaluate effect pasta consumption , main source carbohydrate , context balance diet , maintain health .</detailed_description>
