	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-site , randomize , open-label study design develop detailed transcriptional epigenetic profile immune response pneumococcal vaccination conjugate non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccine senescent immune system old adult . In study , 40 healthy adult age 65 old never receive pneumococcal vaccination , randomize 1:1 ratio receive Prevnar-13 ( Pfizer ) , conjugate 13-valent vaccine Pneumovax 23 ( Merck ) , non-conjugated 23-valent vaccine . Following randomized assignment vaccine , study open-label . Six ( 6 ) study visit occur 70 day , optional 7th visit participant receive second vaccination pneumococcal vaccine one two year randomization . Participants provide blood sample transcriptional , epigenetic biological analysis pre- post-vaccination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-site , randomize , open-label study design develop detailed transcriptional epigenetic profile immune response pneumococcal vaccination conjugate non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccine senescent immune system old adult . This knowledge may lead development effective vaccine increase understanding effect immunosenescence mechanism immune response pneumococcal vaccination elderly . Forty ( 40 ) healthy adult age 65 old never receive pneumococcal vaccination , randomize 1:1 ratio receive Prevnar-13 ( Pfizer ) , conjugate 13-valent vaccine Pneumovax 23 ( Merck ) , non-conjugated 23-valent vaccine . Following randomized assignment vaccine , study open-label.The study sample draw population healthy elderly catchment area UConn Health Farmington , CT . The first six ( 6 ) study visit plan occur 67 day Days -7 , 0 , 1 , 10 , 28 ( ±3 ) 60 ( ± 5d ) . Participants provide blood sample transcriptional , epigenetic biological analysis pre- post-vaccination . One two year receive randomly-assigned vaccination , participant may opt receive administration second pneumococcal vaccine vaccine receive random assignment Visit 2 ( Day 0 ) . This second vaccine provide charge participant . Administration vaccine occur optional Visit 7 participant choose receive second vaccine schedule participant 's convenience one-two year receive first pneumococcal vaccine . If participant opts receive second vaccine within study attends optional Visit 7 , blood sample genomic biologic analysis collect visit .</detailed_description>
