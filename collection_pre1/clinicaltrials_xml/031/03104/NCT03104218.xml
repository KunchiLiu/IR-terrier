	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , electrostimulation technique know modulate motor cortex excitability , show enhance effect rehabilitation population neurological injury . tDCS could similarly effective individual rotator cuff ( RC ) tendinopathy , pathology also associate pain motor control deficit . For treatment RC tendinopathy , sensorimotor training effective reduce pain , increase function enhance motor control shoulder . The addition tDCS sensorimotor training could enhance motor learn associate sensorimotor training thus improve treatment outcome . PURPOSE : To compare , term symptom , functional limitation shoulder control , group receive rehabilitation program center sensorimotor training combine tDCS group receive rehabilitation program combine sham tDCS individual RC tendinopathy . METHODS : Forty adult RC tendinopathy take part 4 evaluation session ( 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 week ) 6-week rehabilitation program . Outcome measure symptom functional limitation ( Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index ) , well acromiohumeral distance ( [ AHD ] ultrasonographic measurement 0° 60° elevation arm ) . The rehabilitation program include sensorimotor training , strengthen education . tDCS apply sensorimotor training motor cortex contralateral side pain . A 2-way ANOVA use analyse effect tDCS outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : tDCS safe easy use technique emerge promising tool induce plasticity facilitate sensorimotor rehabilitation potential application various clinical population . tDCS show induce change outlast duration stimulation , modulate neuronal membrane potential target brain region.Depending flow current , tDCS increase decrease neuronal excitability ; anodal tDCS induces membrane depolarization enhance excitability cortical neuron , whereas cathodal tDCS induces membrane hyperpolarization reduce excitability cortical neuron . As , tDCS potential prime plastic potential give brain region , make responsive another intervention ( phenomenon call metaplasticity ) . For example , show five day anodal tDCS combine training promotes motor skill acquisition still detectable three month later ; effect significantly superior sham tDCS . These effect likely due augmentation synaptic plasticity require presence brain-derived neurotrophic factor . Coupled sensorimotor training , tDCS lead subsequent sustain clinical gains.The beneficial effect tDCS combine sensorimotor train normalize motor cortical activity enhance rehabilitation show population neurological injury , stroke . In musculoskeletal population , anodal tDCS M1 also show lead significant pain level reduction . Evidence suggest tDCS M1 may relieve pain inhibition thalamic sensory neuron disinhibition neuron locate periaqueductal gray matter . In latter study , tDCS specifically aim reduce pain couple sensorimotor training . In fact , evidence effect tDCS couple sensorimotor training musculoskeletal population scarce , effect intervention never evaluate individual RC tendinopathy . Considering RC tendinopathy associate impaired motor control pain decrease excitability motor cortex impair motor learning , believe relevant determine whether tDCS enhance sensorimotor training , improve outcome . PURPOSE - The primary objective randomize control trial compare , term symptoms functional limitation , group receive rehabilitation program center sensorimotor training combine anodal tDCS group receive rehabilitation program combine sham tDCS individual RC tendinopathy . A secondary objective explore effect intervention shoulder control corticospinal excitability . METHODS - Study Design : This triple-blind ( patient , therapist &amp; evaluator ) , parallel-group randomize control trial include four evaluation session 6 month ( baseline , week 3 , week 6 , 3-month ) 6-week rehabilitation program . Interventions : Each participant take part 8-week rehabilitation program supervise independent physiotherapist . This program , previously show effective , target deficit describe individual RC tendinopathy . It include sensorimotor training , strengthen , patient education . Each session last 40 minute , least 75 % sensorimotor training . The rest session use teach revise home exercise . tDCS apply sensorimotor training ( 30 min ) , first five session , session first phase motor learning , characterize considerable improvement performance . Statistical Analyses - Descriptive statistic use outcome measure measurement time summarise result . Baseline demographic data compare ( independent t-test Chi-squared test ) establish comparability group . All data test check distributional assumption inferential statistical analysis . An intention-to-treat analysis use participant analyse group originally assign . All dropout reason drop study report . Any harm unintended effect program record . A 2-way ANOVA ( 2 tDCS [ Real Sham ] x 4 Time [ week 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 ] ) use analyse effect tDCS primary outcome secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
