	<brief_summary>The mainstay antenatal treatment fetal anemia due red cell alloimmunization ( serial ) IUT . The mainstay postnatal treatment HDN ( 1 ) intensive phototherapy exchange transfusion treat hyperbilirubinemia prevent kernicterus , ( 2 ) top-up transfusion treat anemia . Up 80 % infant HDN treat IUT require least one top-up transfusion late anemia first 3 month life . Several risk factor late anemia report , include serial IUT ( due bone marrow suppression ) , severity HDN , reduce use exchange transfusion neonatal period reduce survival transfuse red blood cell . Finally , erythropoietin deficiency also consider possible contribute factor late anemia . EPO increasingly use neonate prevent reduce neonatal anemia without short long-term adverse effect . Several small study casuistic report suggest neonate HDN may benefit treatment EPO reduce risk delay anemia subsequent top-up transfusion . However , author find EPO may less effective expect . Due lack evidence , routine use EPO currently recommend . To determine role EPO group patient , well-designed randomize controlled clinical trial sufficient sample size require . Potentially , EPO stabilize hemoglobin level infant thus prevents top-up transfusion extra admission , create stable natural postnatal course patient HDN .</brief_summary>
