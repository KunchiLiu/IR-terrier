	<brief_title>Assessment Viral Shedding Children Previously Receipt Multiple Doses Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine ( LAIV ) Compared Influenza Vaccine-naïve Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The United States America ( USA ) long-standing paediatric influenza vaccination programme , include use live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) . Following evidence lack effectiveness LAIV 2015/16 , USA suspend use 2016/17 season . The UK introduce LAIV child 2013/14 since closely monitor programme performance . In 2015/16 , UK - contrast USA - find evidence significant effectiveness LAIV laboratory confirm influenza primary secondary care include A/H1N1pdm09 . The UK result concord several geographical setting , although several study report relatively low effectiveness LAIV A/H1N1pdm09 infection compare inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV ) . The reason apparent difference effectiveness currently unclear . The USA indicate Advisory Committee Immunisation Practice ( ACIP ) rescind decision suspend use LAIV , require understand likely underlying mechanism apparent reduction LAIV A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) measure observational study USA evidence problem resolve . Several hypothesis emerge explain apparent reduction A/H1N1pdm09 quadrivalent LAIV effectiveness USA last season discordance finding elsewhere include UK together possible low effectiveness LAIV A/H1N1pdm09 compare IIV . These include one following : 1 . Center Disease Control ( CDC ) / Department Defense ( DoD ) specific find - related chance , methodology , programmatic issue 2 . Reduced replicative fitness current A/H1N1pdm09 strain . 3 . Viral interference/competition A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain vaccine viruses multivalent formulation ; 4 . Prior vaccination LAIV IIV result specific immunological interference H1N1pdm09 vaccine virus replication ; 5 . Repeat LAIV vaccination result broad , long term immunological change affect virus ( mimic adult response ) ; 6 . Combinations Based upon vitro study , manufacturer LAIV ( MedImmune ) state reduced replicative fitness A/H1N1pdm09 strain likely important root cause . However , factor alone explain difference effectiveness observe USA site elsewhere include UK . This suggest important additional factor ( ) involve . The US programme run many year UK - addition child 6 month 24 month age offer IIV , unlike UK . These prior vaccine exposures potential contributory factor . LAIV shed study child could important way confirm whether impediment viral replication indeed explain observed reduction VE , whether prior vaccination influence replication future implication ( ) might UK paediatric LAIV programme . LAIV virus replication child dependent virological host factor . The virus factor include replicative fitness individual strain susceptibility inhibition replicate strain ( ability compete ) . Host factor may influence include pre-existing specific immunity result prior infection previous vaccination ( either LAIV IIV ) , innate immune factor include mucosal immunity . Understanding relative importance different factor two season strain composition A/H1N1pdm09 LAIV virus change compare previously unvaccinated highly vaccinate group ( LAIV IIV ) , potentially give unique insight contribution US LAIV observation .

Admission Paediatric ntensice care unit ( PICU ) invasive ventilation due respiratory illness precede 2 year . 2 . Contraindications LAIV ( notwithstanding allergy egg protein ) , include : 1 . Hypersensitivity active ingredient , gelatin gentamicin ( possible trace residue ) 2 . Previous systemic allergic reaction LAIV 3 . Previous allergic reaction influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) relative contraindication , must discuss CI confirm patient suitability 4 . Children/adolescents clinically immunodeficient due condition immunosuppressive therapy : acute chronic leukaemia ; lymphoma ; symptomatic HIV infection ; cellular immune deficiency ; highdose corticosteroids* . *Highdose steroid define treatment course least one month , equivalent dose great 20mg prednisolone per day ( age ) , child 20kg , dose great 1mg/kg/day . NB : LAIV contraindicate use individual asymptomatic HIV infection ; individual receive topical/inhaled/lowdose oral systemic corticosteroid receive corticosteroid replacement therapy , e.g . adrenal insufficiency . 5 . Children / adolescent young 18 year age receive salicylate therapy association Reye 's syndrome salicylates wildtype influenza infection . 6 . Pregnancy 3 . Contraindications vaccination occasion , e.g . due child acutely unwell : 1 . Febrile ≥38.0oC last 72 hour 2 . **Acute wheeze last 72 hour require treatment beyond normally prescribed regular use child 's treat healthcare professional 3 . **Recent admission hospital last 2 week acute asthma 4 . **Current oral steroid asthma exacerbation course complete within last 2 week 5 . Any significant condition circumstance , opinion investigator , may either put participant risk participation study , may influence result study , participant 's ability participate study . Items 3b3d relative contraindication : Many child `` difficulttocontrol '' symptom fail meet criterion routine basis . Where present , CI able authorise participation casebycase basis , assess child time enrolment . Administration another live vaccine ( e.g . MMR ) within previous 4 week long contraindication LAIV administration , accord update UK Department Health guideline .
