	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The investigator key objective study effect ASTM HRQoL , depression , anxiety AMD patient . The second objective determine association HRQoL , depression , anxiety routinely measure clinical variable . A mathematical model compute HRQoL , depression , anxiety ophthalmic clinical variable develop ASTM plus TAU well TAU alone group . Study Design : The investigator plan conduct single-center , single blind longitudinal randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Research participants 140 men woman ( 70 group ) . Study Recruitment : Potential participant severe AMD 50 year age screen - office practice Dr. Mao per inclusion exclusion criterion Ivey Eye Institute , London , ON . An ophthalmic examination - offer routine care - potential participant ( i.e. , measure best-corrected Snellen visual acuity pinhole acuity ) conduct . Snellen acuity convert LogMAR accord visual angle subtend letter 20/20 = 0.0 , 20/40 = 0.3 , 20/50 = 0.3978 . A value 20/200 = 1.0 assign count finger , hand motion , light perception . No light perception receive value 0.0 . Questionnaire : Patients undergo standardize interview perform trained interviewer measure HRQoL use time trade-off method ( TTO ) potential participant ask couple question quality life 1 ) long participant expect live ? 2 ) many remain year life , , participant would willing trade return treatment permit current vision eye transform permanent perfect vision ( 20/20 ) bilaterally ? . During first office visit ( screen visit ) , interview , patient ask demographic question include age , gender , associate medical condition , concurrent ocular condition , ocular disease AMD , previous ocular surgery , intraoperative complication , preoperative ocular pathology , chronic pain , general disease could affect immune system , actual infection . In addition , patient ask co-morbidities , whether high blood pressure , diabetes , arthritis , heart condition , stroke , non-ocular medical condition . Further , follow self-rated scale administer first office visit : TTO , Visual Function Questionnaire ( VFQ-25 ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7 ) . Randomization : Participants randomize ASTM + TAU TAU alone equally ( 1:1 ) use computer generate randomization number available random.org . Concealment randomization ensure independent staff perform randomization use third party web-based provider ( http : //www.sealedenvelope.com/ ) . Computerized randomization occur Ivey Eye Institute , St. Joseph 's Hospital , London , ON . A telephone number available study concerns/queries . Pre-randomized information store use unique de-identifiers download secure database . Outcome assessor investigator blind treatment . Trial Interventions/Treatment Arms : 1 ) Automatic Self-Transcending meditation ( ASTM ) : Following initial measurement ( common ASTM control group ) , participant ASTM group undergo ASTM training group 10 certified teacher supervision one study collaborator room St. Joseph 's Hospital , London , ON . This involve participate four , 90-120 minute session four consecutive day . This follow weekly 60 minute follow session 4 week , biweekly session week 5-12 week monthly follow-up session 13-24 week . Participants require attend 75 % weekly , bi-weekly , monthly follow-up session . In addition , participant ask practice ASTM home 20 minute twice daily study period ( 24 week ) . Participants ask log practice frequency noteworthy observation log sheet provide . Further , follow self-rated scale administer trained rater fourth ASTM session ( week 0 ) well week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 : TTO , VFQ-25 , PHQ-9 , GAD-7 Questionnaire . 2 ) Control Intervention : Participants randomize control arm ( Treatment Usual ( TAU ) ) continue receive treatment usual . They follow assessment study procedure list . The following self-rated scale administer trained rater week 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 24 : TTO , VFQ-25 , PHQ-9 , GAD-7 . No study procedure apply information collect period . All medication type permit study . Any dosage modification record . The investigator anticipate recruit participant rate least 10 participants/week period 7 week allow attainment sample size n=140 . There obligation participant take part study ; participation voluntary . Sample Size : Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) choose main covariate interest . Based literature , sample size computation perform , alpha = 0.05 , 80 % power , 1.0 mean HRQoL ASTM + TAU group 0.5 mean HRQoL TAU alone group , investigator estimate sample size use two-sample mean test assume equal variance 128 , 64 per group . A sample size 140 ( 70 arm ) account attrition loss data follow ups average 10-15 % recruit . Such moderate attrition rate expect base previously publish study well ongoing study . Data Analysis : Dependent variable : A dependent variable create base HRQoL , interval scale variable take value 0.0 1.0 . Independent variable : Visual acuity better-seeing eye , patient ' demographic characteristic , include age , gender , associate medical condition independent variable . Patients ' demographic characteristic , include age , consider continuous variable . Gender categorize male female associate medical condition categorize `` current medical condition , '' include concurrent ocular condition ; `` disease , '' include ocular disease AMD , chronic pain , general disease could affect immune system , actual infection ; `` medical history , '' include previous ocular surgery , preoperative ocular pathology , intraoperative complication . Data Grouping : Based BCVA , study participant group visual acuity well see eye ( group 1 , 20/20 20/50 ; group 2 , 20/60 20/100 ; group 3 , 20/200 light perception ) . Better see use since correlation show utility score well see eye . These 3 group choose since group 1 represent legal drive vision Canada , group 2 represent moderate visual acuity loss , group 3 represent legal blindness . Analysis : As do many study , HRQoL calculate divide number year patient willing trade return improve quality life estimate number year remain life subtract 1.0 give : HRQoL ( U ) =1- ( number year patient willing trade return improve quality life ) / ( estimate number year remain life ) . Mean , standard deviation , 95 % confidence interval continuous variable utility value , calculate . For categorical variable , visual acuity better-seeing eye , gender , associate medical condition , proportion calculate . The chi-square test statistic independence use compare unwillingness trade time TTO . The unpaired , two-tailed Student t-test use evaluate effect visual acuity well eye four group gender mean TTO utility value . Non-response issue : Non-respondent patient ' characteristic compare respondent patient , ' appear statistically significantly different , result generalize sample population . Data analyze use STATA Software . The unit analysis HRQoL . Univariate bivariate analysis perform independent variable dependent variable elicit impact factor pattern HRQoL without adjust effect variable . Models deem statistically significant associate significant F value ( p &lt; 0.01 ) explain 15 % variability dependent variable . Only independent variable statistically significantly associate HRQoL ( p &lt; 0.05 ) use model construction . Since dependent variable continuous , investigator plan use non-linear regression model assess effect independent variable dependent variable , control confounders . Multicollinearity , high correlation independent variable , interaction effect evaluate model . Validation Analysis : Validation perform developed regression model . The collect data divide two portion : one portion , call `` main data , '' contain 80 % sample total collected utility value associate data ; portion , call `` test data , '' contain remain 20 % . Validation do use test data coefficient value main data order calculate percentage correct case . Similar regression analysis describe performed dependent variable : vision relate quality life measure VFQ-25 , depression score measure PHQ-9 , anxiety score measure GAD-7 .</detailed_description>
