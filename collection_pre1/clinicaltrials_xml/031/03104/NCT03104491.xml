	<brief_summary>This study two phase , Phase I Phase II . The main goal Phase I portion research study see dose post-transplant inotuzumab ozogamicin safely give subject without many side effect . The Phase II portion study see side effect see medication transplant . Inotuzumab ozogamicin combination antibody chemotherapy . This mean target ALL cell deliver chemotherapy ALL cell . Research show patient , cause disease go back remission . Inotuzumab ozogamicin consider experimental study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Post-Transplant For Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective Phase I : To define post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation maximum tolerate dose inotuzumab ozogamicin Phase II : To define safety profile inotuzumab ozogamicine therapy allogeneic transplant . Phase II : To determine rate veno-occlusive disease / sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ( VOD/SOS ) . Secondary Objective ( ) 1 . To evaluate non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) , relapse , relapse-related mortality overall survival ( OS ) 1 year . 2 . To determine incidence myeloid toxicity secondary graft failure . 3 . To determine inotuzumab dos effective eradicate MRD cohort patient . Study Design This Phase I/II study inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment patient underwent allogeneic transplantation ALL high risk relapse . The Phase I portion study 3/3 dose escalation trial cohort expansion maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Subjects receive study treatment relapse disease , unacceptable toxicity , 30 day cycle 4 , death , whichever occur first . Phase I : Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Dosing Escalation Subjects assess safety tolerability ( include adverse event , serious adverse event , clinical/laboratory assessment ) use continuous monitoring approach . Phase II : Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Subjects assess safety tolerability ( include adverse event , serious adverse event , clinical/laboratory assessment ) use continuous monitoring approach . In order include safety profile endpoint review , subject must receive least 1 cycle treatment .</detailed_description>
