Official Title : Removal Cytokines patient undergo cardiac surgery CPB ( The REMOTE Study ) Study type : Interventional Study design : randomize , control Endpoint Classification : Efficacy study Interventional Model : Parallel assignment Masking : Single blinding ( Subject ) Primary purpose : Treatment Patients elective cardiac surgery expect CPB duration &gt; 75 min ( e.g . valve surgery , CABG , combine procedure , redo ) enrol study give informed consent . Selection patient direct randomization . Patient drop replace .</detailed_description>
