	<brief_title>Transplant Regimen Adherence Kidney Recipients Engaging Information Technologies : The TAKE IT Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator evaluate technology-enabled strategy design promote medication adherence , routinely monitor regimen use , mobilize appropriate transplant center resource respond early kidney transplant recipient demonstrate inadequate adherence . Among patient receive kidney transplant ( KT ) , 5-year risk organ ( graft ) failure high ; 30 % decease donor 27 % live donor recipient . Medication non-adherence lead root cause graft failure , KT recipients high report rate poor adherence ( ~35 % ) among organ transplant recipient . Despite many attempt , successful intervention evaluate date significantly improve KT recipient ' regimen adherence subsequent health outcome time . There many reason individual may take medication regimen prescribe , include limited : forgetfulness , misunderstanding , regimen complexity , side effect , health issue , social support , motivation cost . Therefore single solution address patient . A healthcare team must understand precise nature patient 's adherence barrier order properly respond . Yet medication adherence clinically assessed part routine post-transplant care , prior study find medical staff readily identify poor adherence among patient , let alone reason . Using evidence research team 's extensive previous study chronic disease context , investigator implement comprehensively test potentially low cost , 'low touch ' , thus highly scalable intervention : Transplant regimen Adherence Kidney recipients Engaging Information Technologies ( TAKE IT ) strategy . The TAKE IT strategy leverage transplant center 's electronic health record web-based patient portal , well mobile technology : 1 ) educate patient prescribe Rx regimen , 2 ) help organize daily regimen schedule efficient manner , 3 ) remind via SMS ( Short Message Service ) text take medicine , 4 ) routinely monitor regimen use , 5 ) provide care alert engage appropriate transplant center clinical staff ( e.g . nurse coordinator , pharmacist , social worker ) medication concern detect . All component TAKE IT strategy develop prior NIH support , refine 'user ' input ( patient , family , clinic staff ) , efficacy test non-transplant setting . The research team 's primary aim hypothesis ( H ) : Aim 1 Test effectiveness TAKE IT strategy , compare usual care , improve KT recipient ' : H1 treatment knowledge ( indication , potential side effect , demonstrate proper use ) H2 medication use ( regimen adherence via self-report , pill count , pharmacy record , tacrolimus level ) H3 transplant-specific outcome ( Î” eGFR ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ) , quality life , re-hospitalization ) H4 chronic disease outcome ( blood pressure , HbA1c ) They conduct 2-arm , patient-randomized control trial two large , diverse transplant center ( Northwestern University ; Mayo Clinic ) . 300 KT recipient within 3 month transplant ( 'de novo ' ) 400 'established ' patient 18 month 3 year post-KT recruit follow 2 year ( N=700 patient ; n=350 per site n=175 per study arm within site ) . In-person interview conduct baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . To determine proximal effect TAKE IT strategy , telephone interview also administer 6 week post-baseline . Electronic health pharmacy record ascertain capture medication adherence clinical outcome . The secondary aim : Aim 2 Examine persistence effect TAKE IT strategy outcomes 2 year among new establish KT recipient . Aim 3 Evaluate fidelity component TAKE IT strategy time , investigate patient , provider , transplant center barrier implementation . Aim 4 Determine cost deliver TAKE IT strategy transplant center perspective . Additionally , investigator closely evaluate implementation component TAKE IT strategy launch 2 year follow-up ( Aim 2 ) . Their evaluation include range process outcomes assess intervention 's reliability sustainability . These finding determine whether specific modification TAKE IT strategy necessary ( Aim 3 ) . Finally , team estimate incremental cost implement sustain TAKE IT strategy perspective two transplant center ( Aim 4 ) .</detailed_description>
