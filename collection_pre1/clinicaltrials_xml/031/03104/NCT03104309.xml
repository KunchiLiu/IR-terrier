	<brief_summary>Adenomyosis define endometrial tissue ( gland stroma ) present within myometrium . The depth endometrial penetration use diagnosis adenomyosis yet agree ; opinion range one high power field 25 % myometrial thickness . It common condition woman age 40-50 year consider important cause dysmenorrhea menorrhagia around 65 % case . Until past year ; hysterectomy suggest definitive treatment , however ; may acceptable woman willing loss fertility . Many treatment line study proved beneficial effect adenomyosis GnRH agonist , danazol , combine oral contraceptive pill , dienogest finally endometrial ablation [ 5 ] . However , line treatment commonly use high incidence side effect relatively high cost . The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( LNG-IUS ) emerge effective line treatment adenomyosis associate pain bleeding . It successfully , within 6 12 month , down-regulate estrogen receptor adenomyotic tissue lead decidualization atrophy adenomyosis . In fact , adenomyotic woman respond well LNG-IUDs show high acceptability satisfaction , hand ; group woman may respond LNG-IUDs opt remove start new medical surgical option treatment . However , factor relate LNG-IUS effectiveness patient adenomyosis well available . Only one report state large uterine volume could factor associated LNG-IUS treatment discontinuation adenomyotic patient . For reason ; prediction responsiveness LNG-IUS interesting issue address . The present study examines hypothesis patient 's data report baseline visit use LNG-IUSfor control pain/bleeding adenomyosis help prediction responsiveness important line treatment 6 month follow visit . Up knowledge ; clinical trial register conduct predict responsiveness LNG-IUS control pain/ bleed adenomyosis .</brief_summary>
