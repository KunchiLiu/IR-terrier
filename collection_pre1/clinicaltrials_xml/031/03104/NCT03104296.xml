	<detailed_description>The improvement neonatal intensive care occur last decade lead substantial increase survival rate preterm infant , especially extremely low birth weight . Nevertheless , delicate maturation central nervous system ( CNS ) extrauterine environment , together possible development prematurity-related clinical complication could result brain injury , place population high risk long-term neurodevelopmental disability . Significant anatomical change brain structure associate preterm birth ; among , enlarge ventricle subarachnoid space , reduce subcortical white matter decrease cortical deep nuclear grey matter common . Additionally , increase evidence abnormal pattern neuronal myelination brain connectivity preterm infant , possible concern long-term effect language , motor social skill . As cognitive ability , direct correlation gestational age ( GA ) previously show large cohort preterm born child school age . In early phase , developmental CNS characterize intrinsic neuroplasticity , accord repeat experience could influence arrangement synaptic connection neural circuitry , thus result structural functional change . By exploit feature , early establishment supportive interventionsÂ¬ might aid compensate anatomical functional constraint connect preterm birth improve preterm infant ' neurodevelopment . The validation clinical tool able predict neurodevelopmental outcome preterm population might help identify infant great risk impairment , would benefit early rehabilitative intervention . Near infrared reflect spectroscopy ( NIRS ) provide bedside , non-invasive , continuous monitor cerebral oxygen saturation ( CrSO2 ) largely adopt assess neonatal brain oxygenation perfusion intensive care setting . Perioperative CrSO2 recently propose possible predictor later neurodevelopmental outcome neonates undergone cardiac surgery ; data evaluate correlation CrSO2 later neurodevelopment preterm infant , however , scarce limit first day life ; time , CrSO2 widely influence occurrence systemic haemodynamic instability blind several clinical complication , know potential cause brain damage , occur later hospital stay thus necessarily directly relate change cerebral oxygenation within first day life ( e.g . necrotizing enterocolitis [ NEC ] , late onset sepsis ) . Hence , aim study evaluate whether CrSO2 monitoring , perform NICU discharge clinically stable low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm infant , predict psychomotor outcome first 24 month correct age ( ca ) . Infants meet eligibility criterion ( detail see specific section ) undergo 3-hour continuous monitoring CrSO2 mean INVOS 5100 oximeter satisfy follow condition : stable clinical condition , need oxygen supplementation , full enteral feeding ( defined 160 ml/kg/day ) After discharge , enrol infant include long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up , part normal routine care preterm-born infant aim early identification treatment neurocognitive sequela possibly related preterm birth . In context , psychomotor outcome ( PSO ) assess 6 , 12 , 18 24 month ca mean Griffiths Mental Development Scales 0-2 year [ 26 ] . These scale investigate five main area ( locomotor , personal social skill , hear language , eye hand coordination , performance ) , provide general developmental quotient ( DQ ) infant 's ability five sub-scale quotient ( SQ ) developmental area . The Griffiths Scales administer individually , 45-min period , professional train psychologist whole study period implement presence infant 's parent . A correlation analysis mean CrSO2 value GQ/SQ score follow-up appointment perform . In order evaluate effect possible confounding variable observe result , mixed model include number risk factor know affect preterm infant ' neurodevelopment build hierarchical multiple regression analysis . Significance level set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
