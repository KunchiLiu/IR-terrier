	<brief_title>Neurodevelopment Infants With Complex Congenital Heart Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator ' long-term goal develop method identify infant likely adverse neurodevelopmental outcome follow neonatal treatment CCHD develop test intervention apply early infancy . The necessary first step systematically describe early neurodevelopment use complementary set observational neurophysiological measure may predict cognitive motor delay earlier currently possible infant CCHD . Each measure provide unique information development include ( 1 ) neuroimaging brain maturity brain injury , ( 2 ) hair fingernail cortisol saliva immune system function , ( 3 ) heart rate variability ( HRV ) autonomic nervous system function ( ANS ) , ( 4 ) Bayley Scales Infant Development ( BSID-III ) cognitive motor function , ( 5 ) naturalistic play session incorporate kicking , general movement analysis , Test Infant Motor Performance ( TIMP ) motor development , ( 6 ) mobile paradigm learning , memory , task-specific coordination . The investigator look type relationship among measure within time point description development across time point prediction development . The investigator ' core hypothesis infant CCHD measurable deficit cognitive motor development birth ~ 6 month age compare healthy control group typology develop neurodevelopmental measure reliably predict cognitive motor delay first six month life infant CCHD .</detailed_description>
