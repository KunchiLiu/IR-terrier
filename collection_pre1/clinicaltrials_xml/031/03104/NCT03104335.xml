	<brief_title>Apatinib Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients : Phase 2 , Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From April 1st 2017 June 1st 2019 , participant meet follow criterion include : 1 ) histologically confirm high-grade soft tissue sarcoma ( rhabdomyosarcoma liposarcoma exclude ) ; 2 ) initial treat orthopedic oncology department three affiliated hospital Peking University , include Peking University People 's Hospital , Peking University Shougang Hospital Peking University International Hospital ; 3 ) amenable curative treatment ; 4 ) multiple metastatic lesion could cure local therapy unresectable local advanced lesion ; 5 ) measurable lesion accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) ; 6 ) expect live long 3 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 1 acceptable hematologic , hepatic , renal function ; 7 ) need verified refractory doxorubicin ifosfamide . All participant need sign inform consent form data collection use research purpose inclusion , child patient ' inform form sign legal parent . Once patient register , he/she evaluate his/her doctor department clinic , his/her follow-up do every eight week least chest CT well image tumor lesion sit . A follow-up file send every eight week coordination desk department . This study approve institutional review board , Peking University People 's Hospital , Peking University Shougang Hospital Peking University International Hospital Ethics Committee Clinical Investigation , conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki Good Clinical Practice . The investigator demand patient use least doxorubicin ifosfamide . In phase I trial , apatinib ( Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine , Lianyungang , China ) show good oral bioavailability dose 850 mg day , maximum-tolerated dose . Considering , participant design receive 750 mg daily oral administration apatinib body surface area ( BSA ) &gt; 1.5 500mg daily BSA &lt; 1.5 . If investigator meet treatment interruption grade 3 hematologic grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity , dose reduction 750 mg 500 mg apatinib per day , supportive care allow management adverse event ( AEs ) . The primary objective describe efficacy apatinib sarcoma patient . Endpoints objective response rate ( CR+PR ) Progression-Free-Survival ( PFS ) protocol describe contain apatinib accord RECIST 1.1 . The secondary objective overall survival ( OS ) , duration response ( DR ) characterization toxicity . PFS define time start use apatinib disease progression death , whichever occur first . OS define time start use apatinib death . The period appearance response stable disease progression death thus consider duration response ( DR ) . Safety evaluation base frequency severity toxicity grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events .</detailed_description>
