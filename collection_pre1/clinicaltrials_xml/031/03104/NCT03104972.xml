	<brief_summary>The possibility influence brain activity steadily enhance behavioral performance external intervention long fascinated neuroscientist . One technique , transcranial electrical stimulation ( tES ) , receive great interest . Transcranial electrical stimulation ( tES ) current research include two type stimulation : transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) transcranial random noise stimulation ( tRNS ) . The tES technique involve application constant weak direct current ( e.g . 1-2 mA ) brain via skin-electrode interface , create electric field modulate neuronal activity . The safety profile tES excellent . Despite effective pharmacotherapy ADHD need improvement cognitive dysfunction behavioral symptom inadequately cover pharmacological psycho-social intervention . Since ADHD common neurodevelopmental disorder childhood significant negative lifetime outcome , non-invasive brain stimulation method investigate childhood adolescent neuropsychiatric disorder show promising result . If tES significantly effective certain symptom ADHD , may offer many advantage therapy . Treatment ADHD non-invasive brain stimulation recently review medical literature , conclude technique seem efficacy ADHD , however , standardize study protocol need determine . In study intend examine efficacy tDCS tRNS child ADHD effect ADHD symptom , memory , executive function , randomize control crossover study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>External influence neuroplastic process may use functional improvement disease , particular improve cortical function . The possibility influence brain activity steadily enhance behavioral performance external intervention long fascinated neuroscientist . One technique , transcranial electrical stimulation ( tES ) , receive great interest great potential use basic research clinical application . Transcranial electrical stimulation ( tES ) current research include two type stimulation : transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) transcranial random noise stimulation ( tRNS ) . The tES technique involve application constant weak direct current ( e.g . 1-2 mA ) brain via skin-electrode interface , create electric field modulate neuronal activity . This modulation polarity dependent toward depolarization anodal stimulation ( excitatory ) toward hyperpolarization cathodal stimulation ( inhibitory ) , lead transient change rest membrane potential . The cumulative effect long stimulation result polarity-dependent facilitation inhibition spontaneous neuronal firing rate consider neuromodulatory . tDCS , provoke sub-threshold modulation neuronal excitability without depolarize action potentials5 . Post stimulation effect tDCS depend duration stimulation ( lasting several minute hour ) find area electrode also remote network change . The mechanism tRNS influence brain activity differs tDCS . The delivery tRNS use equipment tDCS . In tRNS , however , electrode use stimulate either homologous location bilaterally different region simultaneously . tRNS use stimulate region current varies randomly time . Such stimulation induce excitability last 60 minute per 10 minute stimulation1 . The beneficial type tRNS high-frequency ( 100-640Hz ) . This randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study ADHD child . Eligible participant randomize 3 follow group : 1. tDCS-placebo ( sham ) group receive either tDCS match placebo ( sham ( 5 follow day ( one session day ) . After one week break , crossover control group sham group : receive tDCS 1st week get sham , receive sham 1st week receive tDCS 3rd week . 2. tRNS-sham group , receive type intervention interval tRNS instead tDCS . 3. tDCS-tRNS group . Here intervention provide interval , real tDCS real tRNS provide counterbalanced fashion . This would allow compare different treatment within-subject design , well compare effect sham stimulation first two group between-subject design . The total duration subject participation 4 week . The study conduct ADHD clinic Neuro-Cognitive Centre , Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center . tDCS : Stimulation would apply use semi-dry 5X5 cm electrode . The current would 0.75mA , base previous computational modeling tDCS child estimate equal 1-1.5 mA adult . This decision make consider parameter would influence current distribution density site stimulation thinner scalp , less cerebrospinal fluid , small head size paediatric population . A similar dosage use tDCS well tolerated child , associate adverse effects29 . The anodal electrode position dlPFC ( F3 base International 10-20 system , cathodal electrode would place right supraorbital . tRNS : Children active tRNS group receive 0.75mA tRNS ( 100-640Hz ) leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) right inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) via semi-dry 5cm X 5cm electrode , attach designated electrode position ( F3 , F8 ) tES cap follow International 10-20 system ( InnoSphere Inc. , Haifa ) . The left dlPFC right IFG chosen , base contribution executive control inhibition . tRNS applied 20 minute per session iPad cognitive training . Similar duration also use paediatrics use tDCS29 . Similar previous tRNS study child , rational provide tDCS apply 0.75mA . Sham : For sham-tRNS use montage active tRNS . For sham-tDCS use montage active tDCS . The difference active sham tES would case sham tES 30 sec ramp current 0 0.75mA would follow 19 min stimulation 0.75mA active tES , would immediately follow 30 sec ramp period 0mA . Such method show provide effective blindness stimulation condition active sham tES would lead slight itch sensation would disappear due scalp habitation . No stimulation would provide sham group daily session . The study include 60 boy age 7 12 year . The participant recruit among child refer clinic pediatrician , general practitioner , teacher , psychologists parent .</detailed_description>
