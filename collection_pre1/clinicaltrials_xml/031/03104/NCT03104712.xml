	<detailed_description>Background : Pasta rice two commonly consume grain worldwide , former low GI ( e.g . spaghetti ) latter , usually ( depend type ) high GI ( e.g . white rice ) . Low GI food demonstrate improve glycemic control , insulin sensitivity diabetes management ( Thomas Elliott . 2009 , Ajala et al . 2013 ) , associate reduce risk chronic disease ( Barclay et al . 2008 ) , include coronary heart disease ( Mirrahimi et al . 2012 ) . Therefore , GI importance potential dietary strategy reduce postprandial glycemia improve glycemic control , particularly increase rate diabetes . Several study demonstrate addition fat meal reduce glycemic response , suggest dose response manner ( Moghaddam , et al . 2006 ) . The mechanism increase fat reduces glycemic response may effect gastric empty . Fat may modulate gut hormone cholecystokinin ( CCK ) peptide YY , delay gastric emptying ( Pironi et al . 1993 , Moran et al . 2004 ) , know major determinant postprandial glycemia small change substantial effect ( Horowitz et al . 1993 , Rayner et al . 2001 ) . Low GI food result low glycemic excursion compare high GI food , , addition gastric emptying , may exert effect various pathway ( Vinoy et al . Chap 13 . GI Book 2016 ) . Thus , importance explore potential additional benefit beyond reduce glycemic response addition fat . The typical way pasta rice consume addition oil tomato sauce , recommend consumed way Mediterranean diet ( Estruch et al . NEJM 2013 ) . Among many benefit , Mediterranean diet demonstrate reduce risk cardiovascular disease ( Estruch et al . 2013 ) , improved glycemic control ( Esposito et al . 2015 ) encourage many clinical guideline globally cardiovascular risk reduction ( Anderson et al . Canadian Cardiovascular Society , 2016 ) diabetes ( CDA 2013 , Evert et al . 2013 , ADA 2015 ) . Some study explore difference glycemic response different carbohydrate food consume addition fat demonstrate glycemic response indeed reduced.However , GI may remain importance even mean reduce glycemic response introduce . We therefore design randomize control crossover study explore whether addition fat form commonly consume sauce recommend part Mediterranean diet , affect difference glycemic response commonly consume low GI high GI carbohydrate food . Objective : To assess whether addition fat low GI high GI carbohydrate food lower glycemic response equivalently , thus whether difference low high GI food preserve . Scope : The principal scope study evaluate impact two carbohydrate-containing food vary glycemic index , spaghetti rice , postprandial glucose . To confirm two food vary GI , GI rice first test Part A , since GI spaghetti already determine lab . In Part B study , follow consumption test food healthy volunteer ( see Study Design ) , evaluate difference postprandial glucose , well insulin c-peptide . Implications : These result determine whether independent effect GI carbohydrate contain food fat add meal context commonly recommend consume . These result may useful encourage use low GI food great improvement glycemic insulinemic control , important public health concern today 's global society .</detailed_description>
