High cadmium level toxic kidney statistically associate increase risk cancer lung , endometrium , bladder , breast . This study aim investigate regular consumer brown crabmeat high body burden cadmium nonconsumers . This important study address subject . The result research may provide guidance consumption brown meat crab . The hypothesis proposal regular habitual consumption brown crabmeat increase body burden cadmium . This study recruit 45 healthy participant consume brown crab meat 45 healthy participant consume brown crab meat . Volunteers eligible age 40 year old , non-smokers , significant occupational exposure cadmium . Eligibility determine use questionnaire consent volunteer ask complete . Eligible participant ask attend study visit Rowett Institute GP practice Stromness ( depend participant location ) . Participants weigh ask provide urine sample well 40 ml ( 2-3 tbsp . ) non-fasted blood sample . The blood urine sample process Rowett Institute Balfour Hospital Kirkwall ( depend study visit take place ) . Analysis complete Rowett Institute whole blood analyse cadmium , selenium , zinc serum creatinine ferritin . Urine sample measure cadmium , B2-microglobulin creatinine . Recruitment expect take place 4 month . Study participant option receive feedback cadmium , zinc , selenium ferritin level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Crab meat low fat good source sustainable protein also provide high level mineral ( Se , Zn , I ) , vitamin ( B12 ) long chain omega-3 fatty acid . However , crab meat also contain high level heavy metal cadmium ( Cd ) , white meat especially brown meat ( hepatopancreas liver ) . While European legislation set limit 0.5mg Cd/kg wet weight white meat crab , currently limit set brown meat crab due large range concentration find across member state . Cd occur inorganic form environmental contaminant , natural occurrence agricultural industrial source . The general population expose Cd various source , include smoking , non-smoking general population , food principal source . Cd predominantly toxic kidney , also cause bone demineralisation statistically associate increase risk cancer lung , endometrium , bladder breast . Moreover , blood Cd level low 0.5 - 0.8 µg/l associate chronic disease . A study 8,989 US adult National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) find level associate all-cause mortality , cardiovascular disease , heart disease around 5 year follow adjustment number potential confounding factor ( Tellez-Plaza et al . 2012 ) . Cd think absorbed within body use transport pathways essential metal include zinc , calcium iron intestine . After absorption , Cd transport blood liver form complex metallothionein , low molecular weight family protein . In kidney , Cd-metallothionein complex filter glomerulus reabsorb renal tubule . Although absorption Cd diet human comparatively low ( 3-5 % ) , efficiently retain kidney liver , long biological half-life ( 10 30 year ) . Cd excrete urine well-characterized exposure biomarker use quantitative indicator cumulative internal dose . Accumulation Cd increase age ( Olsson et al , 2002 ) , 50yrs age urinary cadmium maximal ( WHO/FAO , 2004 ) . Cd primarily toxic kidney , especially proximal tubular cell accumulation time may cause decrease glomerular filtration rate eventually , renal failure . Cd cause bone demineralisation , either direct bone damage indirectly result renal dysfunction . It long term accumulation Cd toxic effect mainly manifest . As Cd high affinity main intestinal iron transporter ( Kim et al , 2007 ) , absorption Cd influence body iron status close inverse association serum ferritin ( marker iron store ) blood Cd ( Berglund et al , 1994 ) . In regard , study human population show increase blood Cd level decrease serum ferritin woman fertile age pregnancy due generally decrease iron status ( Berglund et al. , 1994 ) . There concern Cd crab meat consumption contribute greatly body 's Cd burden however , study investigate whether Cd present crabmeat increase level Cd body similarly , know whether high Cd intake regular crab meat eater associate increased incidence kidney damage . This study examine issue . There evidence study suggest selenium perhaps zinc , present high level crab meat , may counteract toxicity Cd ( Lindh et al , 1996 ; Skröder et al , 2015 ) . Moreover , evidence may suggest bioavailability Cd crab meat may less compare Cd food ( Lind et al , 1995 ) . The study investigate whether volunteer regularly consume brown crabmeat high level Cd compare volunteer consume crabmeat . A frequency questionnaire design estimate participant ' total brown crabmeat intake evaluate Cd exposure crab consumption compare Cd body burden ( assessed urinary Cd blood Cd level ) determine whether association variable exist whether regular crab meat consumer higher body burden Cd compare non-crabmeat consumer . HYPOTHESIS The central hypothesis regular habitual consumption brown crabmeat increase body burden cadmium OBJECTIVES The objective study determine regular brown crabmeat consumer increase body burden cadmium compare non-crabmeat consumer .</detailed_description>
