	<brief_summary>Preterm birth ( PTB ) occur 37 week gestation major cause neonatal mortality morbidity . PTB result heterogeneous influence . One inherited predisposition spontaneous PTB [ 1 , 2 ] , another change placental microbial composition cause infection , lead inflammation , common cause preterm birth [ 3 , 4 ] . Interestingly , maternal periodontal disease independent risk factor PTB , low birth weight fetal growth restriction [ 5 , 6 ] . Immune responses infectious event inflammation well genetic predisposition inherit condition successfully study use assess genetic expression profiling . The molecular signature set gene , protein , genetic variant variable use marker particular phenotype [ 7 ] . Child morbidity malnutrition result poor growth stunt remains major public health issue affect local population like PTB . Molecular signature include intestinal microbiome development preterm infant evaluate compare term ( â‰¥37 week ' gestation ) counterpart . Moreover , comprehensive examination possible factor associate poor growth poor motor- neurodevelopment assess . In extension study : The primary goal child evaluate perturbation development genomic profile include intestinal microbial habitat child rural limited-resource set birth two year life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The importance early life epigenetics recognize direct implication health later life consistent limitation express peer review publication small sample size study . Rather establish separate cohort study epigenetics young child environment extension study TMEC 15-062 ( Molecular signature Karen Burmese woman Thailand -- Myanmar border ) aim build detailed sampling mother identify biomarkers preterm labor also understand high rate stunt anaemia area , possibly develop predictive tool pave new way prevention future . In addition , mother expose sample procedure birth study able make well-informed decision whether wish enrol child study . The rationale plan sample child born mother participate TMEC 15-062 study summarize follow text : Child gut microbiome assessment nutrition stool sample ( Risk-none ) The intestinal ecosystem dynamic , especially first period life , need evolve scratch , hence investigator want follow child analyse stool sample first 24 month life . investigator propose assess kind impact gut microbiome child 's growth development . Since exposure helminth common study population , child stool sample also use examine helminthic infestation . This point would also include home visit part nutrition evaluation questionnaire direct observation ( food preparation include hygiene , child food content , feed pattern ) relate microbiome . Early childhood Transcriptome capillary blood ( Risk-minimum ) This point enable u understand whether preterm infant different gene expression term counterpart , evolve early period life . Moreover , specific signal child risk suffer malnutrition stunt result gastrointestinal inflammation barrier disruption could pick . Total blood 0.85 mL 2 year Early childhood detection anaemia capillary blood ( Risk-minimum ) Anaemia treat iron supplement effect gut microbiome analyse . Total blood 0.85 mL 2 year Early childhood detection soil transmit helminth infection stool sample ( Risk-none ) Helminth infection treat effect gut microbiome analyse . Stool sample visit . Child growth assessment evaluation motor neurocognitive development ( Risk-none ) Premature infants high risk lifelong health development problem . Investigators propose follow child 's period 2 year assess growth neurocognitive motor development . Preterm child 's growth development compare term neonate . The recommended schedule growth assessment healthy child ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month ) . In study child follow frequently : monthly first year life 3 monthly 2nd year life ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 month ) . The reason include : objective root study TMEC 15-062 preterm infant require close follow , relate perturbation biomarkers stunt , mobile population schedule visit may miss flexible arrangement check anthropometry monthly visit first year life reduces chance poor growth identify . In addition , growth development child bear mother febrile episode pregnancy compare child whose mother experience fever episodes pregnancy . Children poor growth malnutrition give supplementary nutrition nutrition advice give mother .</detailed_description>
