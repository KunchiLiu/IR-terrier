	<brief_summary>The worldwide introduction multimodal enhance recovery program also change perioperative care patient undergo liver resection . This study perform assess comprehensive care package patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) undergo hepatectomy aim minimal physiological disturbance peri-operative period . Peri-operative opioid-sparing analgesia gastrointestinal ( GI ) effect reduce requirement intravenous fluid therapy , early ambulation promote GI function recovery center plan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ERAS Program Improves Recovery HCC Patient Undergoing Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first ERAS program introduce Kehlet 1990 's . ERAS program initially implement colorectal surgery find way general clinical practice , include orthopedic , vascular , thoracic surgery . In field liver surgery , cohort study conduct randomized trial confirm feasibility safety enhance recovery program resectional liver surgery . Randomized study suggest ERAS optimization may contribute decrease stay hospital surgery . We hypothesize opioid-sparing preemptive post-operative multimodal analgesia plus ERAS item would effectively accelerate patient recovery , receive hepatectomy . We focus fundamental variable impact normal physiology enhanced-recovery surgery : fasting , opioid-sparing , exception abdominal drain , GI function rehabilitation . We draw attention fact time recovery far important well outcome measure time discharge hospital . GI function protection restore importance respect ERAS . Traditionally , perioperative fasting consist nil mouth midnight surgery fast postoperatively recovery bowel function . Those empirical practice persist despite emerge evidence reveal excessive fasting result negative outcome delay recovery . Strong assistant evidence exist minimization perioperative fast 2-hour preoperative fast clear fluid early oral food fluid intake postoperatively . Also , current study apply anti-ileus prophylaxis abolition bowel preparation . Optimizing pain control regard one ultimate goal ERAS program : pain risk free surgery . Surgical incision evoke nociceptors induce local inflammatory response . The consequence hyperalgesia consider target well pain control . Here , multimodal opioid-sparing approach emphasize . A regimen compose TAP , local anesthesia , PCA , systematic anti-inflammatory would perform order reduce surgical stress response . Several study report mobilization within 24h colon surgery independent predictor short rehabilitation period . In current study , early postoperative enforce mobilization specific target implement . The purpose study twofold . On one hand examine scientific evidence exists today important element ERAS program present preliminary result implementation program ERAS West China .</detailed_description>
