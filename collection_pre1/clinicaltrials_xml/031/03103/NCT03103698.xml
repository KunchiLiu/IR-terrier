	<brief_summary>The intraoperative assessment analgesia remain problematic analgesia monitor use routine practice . Currently , assessment base hemodynamic change , although hypertension tachycardia neither sensitive specific . An overdose opioids expose many side effect range respiratory depression phenomenon post-operative hyperalgesia . Conversely , under-dosage opioids origin nociceptive stress whose neurovegetative hormonal response aggravate post-operative morbidity promote occurrence implicit memorization . Nociceptive influx detect directly . However , ascent somesthetic area cerebral cortex lead physiological reaction evaluate . In particular , numerous anatomical functional interaction autonomic nervous system nociceptive tract brain stem . These interaction mainly level gray periqueducal substance , rostral ventro-lateral bulbous region , solitary tract nucleus hypothalamus . The nociceptive influx thus lead change activity ANS . The study change ANS would therefore method assess intensity nociceptive influx . This objective method use non-communicating unconscious patient evaluate pain adapt analgesic treatment best . Obese patient receive surgical management often comorbidities restrictive syndrome , obstructive sleep apnea syndrome . They thus represent target choice perioperative analgesic optimization order avoid respiratory complication may relate assay morphine atelectasis , alveolar hypoventilation . It hypothesize device effective intraoperative evaluation analgesia usual method base hemodynamic change intraoperatively anesthetized patient bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>
