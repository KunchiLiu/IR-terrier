	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate efficacy intravesical botulinum A toxin DMSO woman bladder pain syndrome respond first-line treatment . Bladder pain syndrome suprapubic pain bladder fill well frequency , urgency , nocturia absence urinary tract infection pathology . DMSO show reduce pain woman bladder pain syndrome well increase bladder absorption various drug . Botulinum toxin A also show improve pain woman bladder pain syndrome inject bladder suburothelium via cystoscope . The main objective study ass DMSO deliver botulinum toxin suburothelium bladder produce effect direct injection Botulinum toxin well effect DMSO alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Treatment Refractory Bladder Pain Syndrome With DMSO DMSO With Botulinum Toxin A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ) define AUA unpleasant sensation ( pain , pressure , discomfort ) perceive related urinary bladder , associate low urinary tract symptom six week duration , absence infection identifiable cause . If patient also atypical cystoscopic histological feature categorize Interstitial Cystitis . Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) FDA-approved treatment BPS think work exceptional solvent property . It show desensitize nociceptive pathway low urinary tract . It show improve pain woman refractory BPS utilize initially 1960s Stewart begin instill intravesically . DMSO also long known increase absorption agent instilled bladder . In Japanese study , female rat instill chemotherapeutic agent well DMSO chemotherapy alone . Using fluorescence able show DMSO chemotherapy drug able extend deep layer bladder wall compare epithelial layer receive chemotherapy drug . Botulinum toxin A thought work decrease acetylcholine release cause paralysis muscle tissue smooth striate muscle . It show improve pain woman BPS administer via injection It also show improve frequency/urgency patient BPS . Botulinum toxin show effective injected bladder urothelium patient overactive bladder . The investigator hypothesize DMSO deliver botulinum toxin suburothelium bladder produce similar effect direct injection . Prior study woman refractory OAB show instillation result improved continence , urgency , quality life measure UDI-6 IIQ-7 questionnaire . In prospective randomize study patient receive bladder instillation liposome encapsulate botulinum toxin improvement overactive bladder symptom . The investigator hope show improvement patient bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis . Botulinum toxin variable duration effect bladder similar part body . In one study , duration improvement estimate 7 12 month .</detailed_description>
