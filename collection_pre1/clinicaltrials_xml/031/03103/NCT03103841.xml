	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) condition affect around one 20 child . In OSA , muscle soft tissue throat relax collapse sleep cause upper airway become blocked . Breathing briefly interrupt , blood oxygen level fall cause child wake start breathing . These episode happen many time night cause severely disturbed sleep . Untreated OSA may leave child daytime attention difficulty problem learn behaviour . Epilepsy affect approximately 60,000 child UK 30 per cent child associate learn problem . There evidence , include pilot work undertaken study team suggest OSA common child epilepsy , case , sleep disturbance could account learn problem experience . The aim study determine prevalence OSA child epilepsy . The investigator plan carry detailed polysomnography sleep study 55 child epilepsy 28 healthy child ( control ) . These study measure length quality sleep one night spend hospital . Seizure activity period monitor video recording combine electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . Sleep-disordered assessed use variety test measure air-flow , lung expansion blood oxygen level . This study help determine child epilepsy likely OSA healthy child age . OSA almost always treatable benefit detect treat condition healthy child well-established . If OSA prof common find child epilepsy , important carry study see treat condition beneficial effect learn behaviour . This project could lead doctor target sleep-disordered breathe way improve learn outcome child epilepsy . Children epilepsy attend Royal Hospital Children , Edinburgh invite take part study . Children without epilepsy ( control ) also recruit . The child without epilepsy include although statistic incidence OSA general population , information measure sleep team collect available . The study assess sleep time , sleep efficiency , sleep architecture respiratory event child epilepsy control subject . To sufficiently power , plan test 55 child epilepsy 28 healthy control . A sleep physiologist work participant measure : - Polysomnography ( record body function sleep - airflow lung , oxygen level blood , body position , breathe effort rate , electrical activity muscle , eye movement heart rate ) - EEG electroencephalography ( measure electrical activity brain ) , - Electrooculography ( measure rapid eye movement along horizontal vertical ax ) , - Chin electromyogram ( measure electrical impulse chin muscle ) , - Sleep quality . A neurologist physiologist assess seizure frequency discharge seizure , epilepsy type use video EEG monitoring . Further information collect : height , weight , body mass index , antiepileptic medication use , tonsillar size , Mallampati score ( measure base tongue hard palate ) , completion sleep questionnaires participant parent , include sleepiness scale sleep quality index .</detailed_description>
