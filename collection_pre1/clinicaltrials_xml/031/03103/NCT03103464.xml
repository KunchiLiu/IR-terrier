	<brief_summary>Prior discharge admit patient , current UAB Hospital policy recommend physical therapy intervention patient impaired functional mobility . However , UAB Hospital currently standardize physical therapy protocol rehabilitate admit patient impaired functional mobility require moderate assist ( defined physical therapist expend 25-50 % effort assist patient standing ) . In order reduce effect impaired mobility , numerous intervention employ UAB . As result , great variability treatment procedure perform various physical therapist help moderate assist patient return level function prior hospital admission . The purpose study three-fold : 1 ) evaluate whether proposed physical therapy protocol use commercially available medical device , Movi chair , contribute improved mobility moderate assist patient , 2 ) investigate patient rate rehabilitation prior level function similar/different propose physical therapy protocol use Movi vs current non-standardized practice moderate assist patient , 3 ) compare patient confidence physical therapy Movi v current non-standardized practice use survey moderate assist patient . In addition , track participant 's disposition i.e . continue motor functional change follow discharge hospital review physical therapy record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sit-to-Stand Progression Using Movi Chair vs Traditional Practices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most activity daily live require unassisted ability stand sit position . Therefore , physical therapy exercise aim improve essential action critically important patient impaired functional mobility . Although sit-to-stand test well-known tool use assess physical function , recently propose systematic strength training . Those patient would benefit sit-to-stand training require moderate assist great . However , patient significant difficulty initiate sit-to-stand exercise horizontal chair surface largely exclude prior study examine sit-to-stand strength training . These patient exclude safely stand , also manually lift patient pose significant lifting-injury risk physical therapist . Movi commercially available hybrid mechanical lift chair 's key feature build battery power motor ( rat 600 lb ) pivot axis raise low patient 20 degree . We believe feature represent opportunity introduce sit-to-stand strength training previously exclude moderate assist patient . Progressively lower chair 's angle inclination consecutive physical therapy session allow patient practice sit-to-stand reduce effort horizontal angle reach . As sit-to-stand strength training concept propose 2011 , previous study exist concern sit-to-stand physical therapy protocol use chair progressively lower seat 's angle inclination . Currently , therapists use clinical judgment approach patient difficulty stand utilizing exercise , skill repetition , addition strengthen strategy equipment reach goal . Timed sit-to-stand already use UAB order test patient 's progress physical therapy therapy protocol , partly equipment allow progressive lower seat 's angle inclination available . This study conceive due great variability physical therapy Hospital set critical need standardization evaluate protocol potential positively impact patient speed ease recovery prior level functioning . The therapy protocol utilize Movi chair include follow : 1 . Mobilize patient Movi chair ( via lift manual transfer ) 2 . Document low height 5 degree increment ( degree inclinometer attach Movi chair ) patient able complete sit-to-stand transfer minimal assistance ( define require &lt; 25 % effort physical therapist ) allow patient use arm thighs armrest need . 3 . The patient perform 5 sit-to-stand transfer level , rest recovery , additional set increase muscle strength able . 4 . During subsequent visit , patient begin prior set level . If able perform sit-to-stand transfer less minimal assistance , elevation chair lower 5 degree increment able complete sit-to-stand transfer minimal assistance great patient perform sit-to-stand transfer repetition new height . 5 . This protocol continue patient able perform sit-to-stand transfer standard height chair supervision assistance patient discharge next level care . Once able complete sit-to-stand transfer standard height , five-time-sit-to-stand ( FTSST ) perform 3 time per week . Treatment control group utilize standard recliner traditional therapy method ( transfer training , therapeutic exercise ) . Once investigator consent patient study , patient randomize either control group intervention group , non-investigator physical therapist perform usual physical therapy exercise minimize bias study investigator complete therapy . Investigators test FTSST time patient control group 3 time per week . Only investigators treat intervention group use outline protocol 3 time per week . Once intervention group patient able complete sit-to-stand transfer standard height , FTSST perform 3 time per week study investigator . Investigators also record Hierarchical Assessment Balance Mobility ( HABAM ) score intervention group patient test FTSST time added measure mobility . The HABAM interval level mobility instrument already use valid reliable mobility instrument old acute medical population . This score require additional exercise patient beyond FTSST . Investigators ask non-investigator physical therapist care control group patient estimate control group patient ' HABAM , easily estimate work patient routine standard care therapy .</detailed_description>
