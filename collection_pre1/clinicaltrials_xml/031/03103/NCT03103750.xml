	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1 : As part within-subject , two-days , study design , determine whether acute calcitriol ( vs. placebo ) pre-treatment associate great amphetamine ( Amp ) -induced dopamine ( DA ) release caudate , putamen , ventral striatum ( VST ) , substantia nigra / ventral tegmental area ( SN/VTA ) healthy human subject . Specific Aim 2 : To determine whether acute calcitriol ( vs. placebo ) pre-treatment associate well performance test attention ( e.g. , continuous Performance Task CPT-AX ) , treatment amphetamine . Hypothesis : Investigators hypothesize Subjects pre-treated calcitriol faster reaction times/higher accuracy CPT-AX vs. subject pre-treated placebo , treatment amphetamine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increases rate childhood ADHD past two decade lead speculation calcitriol deficiency ( e.g. , secondary increase use sunscreen and/or increase sedentary , indoor lifestyle child ) play causal/contributory role etiology ADHD . To date , evidence direct link lacking . One study show high maternal circulating Vitamin D level pregnancy associate low risk develop ADHD-like symptom childhood . On hand , another study replicate association , prospective study use umbilical cord sample store time birth report difference serum vitamin D level ADHD group versus healthy control . In term clinical trial , one randomize double blind study among adult ADHD report beneficial effect intervention , measure Conners Adult ADHR rating scale , comparison placebo , intervention include combination vitamin D several micronutrient . An analysis moderator positive response ADHD behavior reveal significant predictive effect vitamin D. However , recent study provide intrigue indirect evidence inverse relationship solar intensity ( SI ) and/or altitude ( proxy great sun/UV light exposure ) regional rate ADHD . One study examine three large datasets across 49 U.S. state 2003 2007 , across 9 non-U.S. country . This study examine prevalence ADHD Solar Intensity ( SI ) map . They find inverse association solar intensity prevalence ADHD . Another study examine two national survey datasets . They find inverse relationship altitude prevalence ADHD . Investigators hypothesize , suggest Huber , common denominator study increase vitamin D level expose high solar intensity , know increase altitude .</detailed_description>
