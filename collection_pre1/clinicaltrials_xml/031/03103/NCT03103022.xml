	<brief_summary>Patent ductus arteriosus PDA blood vessel connects right leave side heart usually close birth remain open premature infant bear 30 week ' gestation . When blood vessel remain open long time , may cause problem bleed lung brain , lung injury due prolong need ventilator , poor kidney function . It sometimes become necessary close blood vessel preterm infant . Currently , blood vessel close either medication surgery . Pain medication Ibuprofen Indomethacin routinely use medication close PDA . However , last 5 year , acetaminophen find alternative medication close PDA preterm infant . In multiple study , acetaminophen find safe alternative medication lower side effect current standard management . Intravenous Ibuprofen approve FDA treat PDA preterm infant . Although approved FDA , oral ibuprofen use management PDA . However , success rate single medication approximately 70 % . Both medication use previous clinical study treat condition preterm infant few side effect report . Mechanism medication close PDA different may work effectively together single medication alone . In study , investigator go use two medication ( Ibuprofen Acetaminophen ) time child need treatment eligible participate study . This study base assumption use medication time , investigator close blood vessel effectively either drug alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ductus arteriosus essential blood vessel connects pulmonary artery aorta fetus . The patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) allow oxygenate blood return placenta bypass lung supply fetal systemic circulation . In fetal life , ductus remain open due low partial pressure oxygen , circulate locally produce prostaglandin local nitric oxide production . Constriction ductal vascular smooth muscle ( functional closure ) occur within hour delivery due decrease level prostaglandin rise oxygen concentration . Closure ductus affect several perinatal postnatal factor growth restriction , sepsis , fluid overload . Spontaneous PDA closure occur &gt; 34 % extreme premature infant compare &gt; 95 % infant birth weight 1500 gram . In prospective study , 65 infant less 1500 g birth weight closely follow serial echocardiogram . Sensitivity ductal tissue oxygen prostaglandin differs preterm compare term infant . Without sufficient physiologic hypoxia , ductus may fail close may reopen initial constriction . Several co-morbidities associate prolonged patency ductus preterm infant ( e.g. , prolong ventilator support , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , pulmonary hemorrhage , impaired renal function , intraventricular hemorrhage cerebral palsy ) . Preterm infant uncomplicated respiratory course , PDA commonly manage conservatively . Currently hemodynamically significant PDA manage medically ( indomethacine ibuprofen ) surgically . Recently , acetaminophen gain attention alternative PDA management due low cost , wide availability potential few side effect . In two randomized control trial compare acetaminophen ibuprofen , author show comparable closure rate PDA acetaminophen . To knowledge , combination drug use treat PDA preterm infant prospective study conduct publish determine effectiveness combination ibuprofen acetaminophen treatment PDA . As medication metabolize different organ ( hepatic renal ) , investigator assume incidence adverse event affect . The Investigator hypothesize combination oral ibuprofen oral acetaminophen effective , mechanisms action differ two medication hence may produce therapeutic synergy .</detailed_description>
