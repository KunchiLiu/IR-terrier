	<brief_summary>The investigator study relationship certain oscillatory brain rhythm ( 13-30 cycles/sec ) emerge prominently patient Parkinson 's disease symptom slowness movement . The investigator recruit patient range severity Parkinson 's disease symptom perform electroencephalography ( EEG ) , study team record brain wave use electrode place scalp , patient sit rest perform certain hand task . The investigator analyze record brain wave extract brain rhythm interest relate motor symptom severity well study behavior rest hand movement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantification Beta Activity Routine EEG Recordings Parkinson 's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) devastating , progressive neurodegenerative disease . The hallmark PD loss dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra par compacta ( SNc ) , disrupt motor circuit processing basal ganglia result motor dysfunction include tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia . This disruption motor circuit processing reflect abnormal oscillatory neural activity . For example , record local field potential electrodes implant basal ganglia reveal substantial elevation beta frequency ( 15-35 Hz ) oscillatory activity person PD , increase beta frequency activity suppress follow levodopa treatment deep brain stimulation . However , link frequency amplitude abnormal oscillation degree Parkinsonian symptom unclear . For example , magneto-encephalography reveal beta-frequency oscillatory activity elevate motor cortex even person early-stage PD , clear difference beta frequency oscillation newly diagnose treatment PD . However , study address change frequency oscillation distribution power across frequency . For example , recent study suggest variability ongoing beta-frequency oscillatory activity , case record STN , may strongly correlate symptom amplitude beta frequency oscillation . Therefore , objective investigator 's propose study determine whether change characteristic beta frequency oscillatory activity EEG motor cortex across differ degree Parkinson 's disease . Such information critical understanding ( possible ) link abnormal oscillatory brain activity symptom severity , signal could use potential biomarkers therapeutic efficacy inform design new method intervention This observational , prospective evaluation beta content routine 20-40 minute EEG record patient PD vary period time . The investigator anticipate run data collection 4-6 month outpatient movement disorder clinic . Subjects identify physician refer study team . Patients agree participate screen question answer time routine appointment . If patient decides participate inform consent obtain , clinic appointment make study data collection later date . Patient instruct take normal dopamine replacement medication 12 hour prior EEG study visit interfere brain wave activity study . At study clinic encounter , routine recording make total 33 PD patient ; 11 &lt; 3 year PD diagnosis , 11 &gt; 5 &lt; 10 year PD diagnosis , 11 advance &gt; 10 year PD diagnosis . EEG record use FDA template system facilitate EEG lead placement research coordinator . Clinical description PD severity duration collect subject questionnaire review clinical evaluation . A UPDRS score may determine participant . Following data collection period , EEG record indexed , de-identified , randomly order blind subsequent analysis . These indexed EEG segment quantitatively analyzed determine relative contribution beta frequency recording , comparison duration severity PD symptom beta content also make .</detailed_description>
