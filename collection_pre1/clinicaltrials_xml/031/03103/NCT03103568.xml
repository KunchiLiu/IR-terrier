	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Potential Influence Nitisinone Metabolism Transport Other Drugs Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , 2-arm , 2-period fixed-sequence drug-drug interaction study total 36 ( 18 arm ) male female healthy volunteer . The study consist : Screening , Period 1 ( substrate ) , Period 2 ( substrate + nitisinone ) Follow-up . In screen period , subject assess eligibility . Eligible subject assign one two treatment arm . In Arm A , potential inhibition nitisinone CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 investigate . In Arm B , possible combined effect nitisinone renal transporter OAT1 OAT3 investigate . In Period 1 , subject receive single dose CYP cocktail 3 substrate ( Arm A ) OAT1/OAT3 substrate ( Arm B ) . Substrate plasma concentration measure determination substrate PK ; 48 hour Arm A 8 hour Arm B . During Period 2 , treatment assessment vary slightly 2 treatment arm . Nitisinone administer 14 day , without co-administration substrate , order reach steady state recommend target plasma concentration , interaction substrate study . In Arm A , Period 2 , subject receive nitisinone 16 consecutive day ( 14 day nitisinone two day nitisinone + substrate ) . Nitisinone steady state PK determine base plasma urine sample collect one dosage interval steady state , day co-administration substrate . Nitisinone administer together CYP substrate , plasma sample determination PK collect Period 1 . There final nitisinone dose day substrate administration order maintain therapeutic level throughout 48-hour sampling period . In Arm B , Period 2 , subject receive nitisinone 15 consecutive day ( 14 day nitisinone one day nitisinone + substrate ) . No nitisinone steady state PK characterization conduct arm . On last treatment day , subject receive nitisinone together OAT1/OAT3 substrate . This follow 8 hour blood sample determination substrate PK .</detailed_description>
