	<brief_summary>The investigator 's hypothesis smoking induces inflammation bladder wall . This may predispose development Interstitial cystitis ( IC ) / bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ) . Previous research link one Platelet Activating Factor - PAF interstitial cystitis . The investigator study limited number patient determine whether PAF stable urine whether special precaution ( example - immediate freezing liquid nitrogen ) necessary accurate measurement PAF urine . Patients present office visit ask donate least 50 ml urine . A separate group patient schedule surgery , also ask donate around 25 ml urine surgery . No patient data group assignment , whether smoke interstitial cystitis record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome ( IC/BPS ) severe , chronic bladder condition extremely painful disruptive . Incidence disease increase dramatically recent year , primarily due enhance awareness well define inclusion criterion . Difficulty diagnosis arise diversity symptom severity patient patient different time . IC/BPS generally accept disease exclusion diagnosis reach ruling condition . A firm diagnosis mildly assure patient therapeutic approach alleviate symptom . Several risk factor associate IC/BPS , include age , sex race [ 5 ] modifiable risk factor diet smoking . This proposal test hypothesis cigarette smoking contribute directly change bladder indicative , predispose , IC/BPS . In preliminary study , investigator expose mouse cigarette smoke observed break urothelium , decrease urothelial tight junction protein expression , increase vascularity inflammatory cell bladder wall . This lab previously demonstrate cigarette smoke inhibit endothelial cell platelet activate factor acetylhydrolase ( PAF-AH ) , responsible hydrolysis PAF , result increase PAF , membrane phospholipid-derived inflammatory mediator . The investigator also show calcium-independent phospholipase A2β ( iPLA2β ) responsible majority PAF production endothelial urothelial cell . PAF show increase matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) turn inhibit anti-angiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF ) , thus promote angiogenesis . These study indicate direct relationship PAF accumulation PEDF expression bladder may contribute inflammation smoker . PAF stability urine establish literature . This study propose assess PAF PAF-AH activity urine use various handle method urine specimen . Better understand PAF stability allow good design future experiment involve PAF interstitial cystitis patient . The investigator expose mouse cigarette smoke examine change bladder . observe thin slough urothelium , plus increased vascularization . These change observe bladder wall IC/BPS patient . We measure increase PAF accumulation decrease expression PEDF bladder wall .</detailed_description>
