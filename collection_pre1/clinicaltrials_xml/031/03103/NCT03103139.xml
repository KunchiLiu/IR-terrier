	<detailed_description>1.0 BACKGROUND 1.1 ) Biliary duct injury relatively frequent complication hepatobiliary surgery , commonly laparoscopic cholecystectomy1 . Such injury manifest clinically number way include biliary leakage , biliary stricture formation , associate infectious complication . Biliary leakage common postoperative complication estimate clinically significant 0.8 1.1 % surgery . Prior development sophisticate endoscopic intervention , repeat surgery often necessary management biliary leak . However , advance technique technology gastrointestinal endoscopy largely replace surgery first line intervention biliary leak . The generally accepted goal endoscopic management biliary leak equalize pressure biliary system duodenum , allow bile flow lower pressure small bowel thereby afford leak time close . How best achieve goal topic considerable interest . Randomized study show endoscopic plastic biliary stent placement alone highly efficacious equivalent biliary stent placement endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy . Thin ( 7 French [ Fr ] ) wide ( 10 French ) diameter stent seem similar efficacy regard leak resolution . Beyond well-validated technique , variation clinical practice support high-levels evidence . 1.2 ) One area variation whether biliary stent cross papilla ( short stent ) versus site leak ( longer stent ) . 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE To assess whether place biliary stent across leak versus across papilla alone improve treatment biliary leak . 3.0 STUDY DESIGN : The study prospective randomize controlled trial . All patient undergo Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) treatment bile leak eligible inclusion ( see section initial collection form ) . During ERCP cholangiogram demonstrate leak , patient randomize either A ) papillary stenting strategy B ) cross leak site strategy . Please see diagram complement write description study design . A ) In papillary stenting strategy , regardless leak identify , stent place duodenal papilla distal ( proximal duodenum ) portion bile duct . The goal strategy use stent keep papilla open , thereby decrease pressure gradient allow bile flow preferentially duodenum away leak area . All stent strategy 7 Fr diameter 5 cm long . B ) In cross leak strategy ( leave ) , area bile leakage identify biliary tree , stent place endoscopically across leak area . This theoretically allow underlie injure bile duct tissue heal . The diameter stent ( 7Fr ) papillary stenting strategy use length vary order bridge leak region ( 5-15cm ) . The decision whether perform sphincterotomy entirely determine attend endoscopist part study . The 7Fr stent use may easily place whether sphincterotomy perform . It record whether sphincterotomy perform . All procedure evaluate study do part standard clinical care . Following initial ERCP intervention , patient receive routine post-procedural care . They serial monitoring . CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS The primary outcome successful resolution bile leak ERCP strategy . This require require 2 criterion : A . No leakage bile follow ERCP 5 week . Resolution confirm demonstration leaking contrast prior leakage site cholangiography . B . No ERCP procedure do initial ERCP 5 week ERCP treat bile leak . The proportion patient randomize arm resolution bile leak 5 week compare . There several secondary outcome : A . Time ERCP removal surgical drain ( day ) B . Time ERCP complete cessation output drain ( day ) C. Presence significant finding 5th week cholangiogram . These include bile duct stone biliary stricture . D. Requirement surgery treat bile leak . E. Endoscopic complication 1st 2nd ERCP include pancreatitis , bleed perforation , cholangitis , stent occlusion within 5 week initial 2nd ERCP . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATONS : Patients randomize 1:1 fashion either papillary stenting strategy group cross leak stenting strategy group . Dichotomous outcome include primary outcome ( successful resolution bile leakage ) compare use Fischer 's exact chi square test . Continuous baseline charactersistics outcome compare use Wilcoxan rank sum test T test depend distribution . If imbalance occur , logistic regression model develop control imbalances covariates primary outcome model . Secondary outcome involve time clinical improvement arm compare use Cox Regression analysis , allow inclusion covariates depend degree balance baseline characteristic . Analyses perform use SPSS v.23 SAS v9 ; two-sided p = 0.05 use primary secondary outcome . Based retrospective query 32 consecutive previous case bile leak manage Los Angeles County hospital use stent bridge leak use G*Power estimate total sample size 88 adequate ( 2 side alpha 0.05 beta 0.2 ) detect 20 % difference ( 80 vs 99 % ) successful resolution bile leak two group . Based data past 1 year Los Angles County hospital estimate would 5 % 5-week attrition thus sample size determine 92 patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergo ERCP treatment suspect acute bile leak eligible inclusion ( bile leak felt complication surgical intervention ) . A patient suspect acute bile leak patient refer within two week follow original surgery.. Legally authorize representative may serve surrogate consent inclusion study . Bile leak suspect base following : A ) Persistent , significant drainage bilious fluid postsurgical drain follow hepatobiliary surgery cholecystectomy , . B ) Compatible symptom plus imaging finding abdominal ultrasonography , compute tomography , HIDA scanning , MRCP abnormal intraabdominal fluid collection set recent hepatobiliary surgery . Patients bile duct transection ( duct totally sever 2 part ) exclude know amenable endoscopic therapy . Further , suspect bile leak nonsurgical etiology exclude study ( malignancy , trauma , spontaneous perforation , rarer cause ) . Bile leak suspect two week post surgery also include . Additionally patient pregnant , imprisoned , age 18 , unable give inform consent , undergone prior biliary diversion surgery exclude .</criteria>
