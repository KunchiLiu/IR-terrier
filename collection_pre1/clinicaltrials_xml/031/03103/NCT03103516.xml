	<brief_title>Epidural Decompression Surgery Within 24 Hours After Acute Spinal Cord Injury Improves Spinal Nerve Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whether early epidural decompression surgery restore neurological function patient acute spinal cord injury ( complete incomplete ) , effective time window epidural decompression , still controversial . This trial verify whether early epidural decompression surgery conducive recovery spinal nerve function patient acute spinal cord injury ( complete incomplete ) compare delay surgery . This trial begin August 2017 . Data analysis 200 patient finish December 2019 . All result complete December 2020 . This trial provide clinical evidence selection time epidural decompression surgery patient complete incomplete spinal cord injury . Adverse event Adverse event obtain patient legal representative . Major adverse event include : limb paralysis deterioration , re-operation , respirator use ( 1 week ) , tracheostomy , septicemia , pneumonia , acute respiratory distress syndrome , atelectasis , respiratory complication , wound infection ( superficial deep ) , urinary tract infection , infection , gastrointestinal bleeding , peptic ulcer , intestinal obstruction , acute myocardial infarction , heart event , pulmonary embolism , cerebrovascular complication , hepatic failure , renal failure , delirium depression . Statistical method 1 . All data analyze use SPSS 19.0 software . 2 . Normally distributed measurement data express mean , SD , minimum , maximum . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) median upper quartile ( q3 ) . Count data present percentage . 3 . Measurement data among group compare use two-sample t-test Mann-Whitney U test . 4 . Count data analyze use chi square test Fisher 's exact test . Ranked data analyze use Wilcoxon signed-rank test . Sample size ASIA motor score one main outcome measure . In accordance previous study ( Chikuda et al. , 2013 ) , take power = 0.8 significance level Î± = 0.05 , need 45 patient per group difference detect ASIA motor score group 12 point common standard deviation 20 . If assume patient loss rate 20 % , require 54 patient per group , totally 108 patient . We therefore aim include 200 patient accordance previous condition acute spinal cord injury ( complete incomplete ) treatment participate unit . Data management 1 . All data input spinal cord injury treatment database . After completion study , research group third-party statistical staff carry data collation analysis . 2 . The participate unit responsible fill information database . Data consistency logic check computer program combine manual review . Any question answer person charge project main staff , return data management center , data manager modify update database . 3 . All inspection procedure need repeat several time doubt . All change update require record filing . It strictly forbid use correction fluid correction tape . All researcher require ensure data record case report form authentic .</detailed_description>
