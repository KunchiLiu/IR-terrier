	<brief_summary>Somatostatin analogue last resort medical intervention hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia ( HH ) . The hypoglycemia debilitate even life threaten . There limited experience pasireotide hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia ( one publication ) ; experience octreotide , adult child successful intervention octreotide hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia publish . Pasireotide via different somatostatin receptor bind profile clear effect insulin , glucagon incretin secretion ultimately lead hyperglycemia . This mode action ( especially effect insulin incretin secretion ) could useful set hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia complication gastric bypass surgery report occur 6 month 8-10 year gastric bypass surgery . Although report rare complication surgery , incidence likely higher due condition miss many patient misdiagnosed dump syndrome . Unlike dump syndrome often present early post-operative course improve dietary modification , patient hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia severe postprandial hypoglycemia sometimes fast hypoglycemia symptom worsen time despite dietary modification . Calcium stimulation test often localize area pancreas hyperinsulinemia occur due islet cell dysfunction . The pathophysiology islet cell hypertrophy Nesidioblastosis poorly understand . One theory increase glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) concentration may responsible islet cell expansion subsequent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Unfortunately , hyperinsulinemia hypoglycemia incapacitate patient restrict driving , unable work , must always someone present glucagon due acute severe onset neuroglycopenia . Surgery resect area pancreas Nesidioblastosis low success rate 60 % many patient develop type 1 diabetes result pancreatic resection . Medical treatment option include calcium channel blocker , Diazoxide , Octreotide yet patient often fail treatment well . Pasireotide would likely better option current medical therapy available . With Pasireotide , inhibition insulin release inhibit somatostatin receptor well possible GLP-1 inhibition cause hyperglycemia reduce hypoglycemic episode patient .</detailed_description>
