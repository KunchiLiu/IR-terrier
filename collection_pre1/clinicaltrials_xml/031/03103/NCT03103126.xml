	<brief_summary>The study aim investigate whether 12 week structure aerobic resistance exercise complete home beneficial effect health patient type 2 diabetes compare standard physical activity advice . The study investigate whether exercise reduce factor patient 's BMI , blood pressure waist circumference , well blood glucose insulin sensitivity . Participants use pedometer Therabands carry exercise . This compare give participant physical activity advice sheet structure exercise example .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study 12 week randomise control trial , researcher isolate independent variable home-based combine exercise ensure factor affect patient 's measurement . Participants recruit DESMOND day medical team informing study via Participant Information Sheet . Once recruit informed consent obtain , participant assign ID number remain anonymous , randomly allocate either exercise control group . Ideally 9 participant recruit group . All participant invite Spinnaker Physiology Laboratory Portsmouth University specify date . They health fitness data collect complete 7-day physical activity recall questionnaire , SF-36 Form Self-Efficacy Questionnaire intervention period measure change PA level , self-perceived health status self-efficacy towards exercise . They provide 7 day food diary complete . A control group include researcher rule factor may affect glycaemic control anthropometric measurement . The control group give Physical Activity Advice sheet mimic would normally access DESMOND . The control group receive Physical Activity advice sheet researcher talk advice sheet participant . If control group intervention , would less normally access part normal diabetes treatment . The exercise group give therabands pedometer , Physical Activity Log , Pedometer log , theraband protocol Physical Activity Advice sheet , explain participant . All theraband exercise perform researcher ensure participant good technique . The exercise intervention resistance segment involve exercise group perform 7 theraband exercise three day per week non-consecutive day . For aerobic exercise , participant ask use provide pedometer record number step complete day 1 intervention ( assume day , complete normal daily activity would day week ) . They ask add 2,000 step onto daily step ; amount become daily step goal . Once reach goal 4 5 day , ask increase step goal 500 . The participant invite back 12 week repeat pre-study measure assess change .</detailed_description>
