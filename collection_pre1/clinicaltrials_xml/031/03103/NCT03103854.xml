	<brief_summary>This 2x2 study examine impact novel exercise regimen daily text message reminder patient high risk cardiovascular disease . Patients participate cardiac rehabilitation randomize either moderate intensity continuous training ( MICT ) novel exercise regimen consist three period high intensity exercise , call BURST exercise . Additionally , half patient exercise group randomize receive daily text message reminder improve adherence prescribe exercise regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Strategies Improve Cardiometabolic Status Adherence Exercise Regimens Patients High Risk Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous study demonstrate important cardiometabolic impact high intensity exercise patient high risk cardiovascular disease . It also know adherence exercise regimens poor within population . This study compare impact current standard care , moderate intensity continuous training ( MICT ) novel exercise regimen call BURST exercise within population patient high risk cardiovascular disease . BURST exercise consist three period high intensity physical activity spread throughout day . Additionally , mobile technology continue use improve adherence exercise regimen , study also seek compare impact text message reminder patient prescribed exercise regimen examine study . Thus , patient also randomize either receive daily text message reminder , receive text message reminder . Recruitment conduct Cambridge Cardiac Rehab Ontario , Canada . Potential study subject evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion , give write informed consent , randomize , 1:1 ratio , either MICT BURST exercise . Additionally , patient randomize 1:1 ratio either receive text message reminder receive text message reminder . Patients prescribed MICT regimen ask exercise 30 minute per day moderate intensity , least five day per week . Patients prescribe BURST exercise regimen ask exercise 10 minute per session , three time day high intensity , least five day per week . Patients randomize receive text message reminder send four daily text message reminder reading : `` Please remember exercise 30 minute today . '' Adherence exercise regimen measure daily logbook . Patients ask log time exercise duration . BRUCE protocol stress test conduct patient baseline ( begin study ) , three month one year . Hemoglobin A1C blood test , height weight measurement lipid profile blood test also conduct baseline ( begin study ) , three month one year .</detailed_description>
