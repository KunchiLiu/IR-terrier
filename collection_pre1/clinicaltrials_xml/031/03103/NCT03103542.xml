	<criteria>1 . Signed date informed consent provide patient , patient 's legally authorize representative patient legal age . Assent obtain pediatric patient accord local regulation 2 . Male patient age diagnose severe haemophilia A , confirm medical record 3 . Previously treat plasmaderived recombinant conventional extended halflife FVIII 4 . Diagnosed high titer inhibitor ( historical peak ≥5 Bethesda unit ( BU ) /mL accord medical record ) 5 . Inhibitor titer &gt; 0.6 BU screen 6 . Failed previous ITI attempt ( ) plasmaderived recombinant conventional extended halflife FVIII include use immunosuppressant The attempt document medical record follow characteristic : A minimum FVIII dose equivalent low dose arm International ITI study ( 50 IU/kg , 3 times/week ) A minimum ITI treatment period 33 month Shorter 33 month downward trend least 20 % inhibitor titer 6month period initial 3 month ITI treatment 7 . All patient must practice effective contraception study 3 month last dose study treatment 1 . Other coagulation disorder ( ) addition haemophilia A 2 . History hypersensitivity reaction associate rFVIIIFc administration 3 . High risk cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , thromboembolic event , judge investigator 4 . Planned major surgery defer study completion . Minor surgery tooth extraction insertion/replacement central venous access device allow . 5 . Concurrent systemic treatment immunosuppressive drug within 12 week prior screen . Exceptions include : ribavirin treatment Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , and/or systemic steroid ( total 2 course pulse treatment last 7 day within 12 week prior Day 1 ) and/or inhale steroid 6 . Abnormal renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL ) assess local lab 7 .
