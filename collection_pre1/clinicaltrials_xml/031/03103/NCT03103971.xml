	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate preliminary safety huJCAR014 adult patient CD19+ relapse refractory ( R/R ) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile huJCAR014 CD19+ R/R aggressive B-cell NHL ALL . II . To assess antitumor activity huJCAR014 CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL ALL . III . To estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL ALL treat huJCAR014 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess cellular humoral immune response huJCAR014 . II . To assess pharmacodynamic effect huJCAR014 . III . To assess effect huJCAR014 product attribute safety , PK , antitumor activity . IV . To assess effect tumor tumor microenvironment huJCAR014 PK biomarkers . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study huJCAR014 . Patients undergo leukapheresis . Beginning 14-16 day leukapheresis , patient undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprise either cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) daily 1 day fludarabine IV daily 3 day cyclophosphamide fludarabine IV daily 3 day . Within 36-96 hour completion lymphodepleting chemotherapy , patient receive huJCAR014 IV 20-30 minute day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 30 day first 3 month , every 3 month 12 month , yearly 15 year .</detailed_description>
