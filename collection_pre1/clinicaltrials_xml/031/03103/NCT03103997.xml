	<brief_summary>Since inception , endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) proven valuable diagnostic prognostic tool evaluate diverse number pathology . One pathology chronic liver disease ( CLD ) , EUS-guided liver biopsy become well-accepted method tissue acquisition . EUS-LB also compare percutaneous transguluar route show least comparable ability obtain adequate tissue CLD . Though enhancement EUS-FNA , dry suction , stylet pull proven demonstrate increase diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA , use wet suction technique ( WEST ) demonstrate ability obtain cellular tissue sample less blood contamination . In attempt obtain improvement tissue adequacy , less blood contamination EUS-LB , use wet heparinized needle investigate compare conventional EUS-LB patient CLD . To subject shall select undergo EUS-LB . As standard perform 3 needle pass EUS-LB , subject undergo one pas follow designation : pas 1 : conventional EUS-LB [ flush ] , pas 2 : dry heparin heparin [ 5 milliliter ( mL ) heparin flush flush air ] , pas 3 : wet heparin [ 5 milliliter ( mL ) heparin flush retain needle ] . It predict specimen collect heparinized needle shall show improved adequacy compare conventional EUS-LB . It also predict heparin wash lead less blood contamination compare conventional method . Subjects shall also monitored adverse event ( AE ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Since inception 1992 , endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) continue evolve method obtain diagnostically accuracy gastrointestinal , extra-luminal pathology . Present society guideline European Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ESGE ) American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) estimate overall 60-90 % diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA . However , accuracy dependent upon determination adequacy expert gastrointestinal pathologist , may available center . To enhance diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA , several technique describe include , acquisition core specimen fine needle biopsy ( FNB ) , use stylet , suction . Regarding FNB , technique allow acquisition tissue specimen intact tissue architecture therefore ability immunohistochemical staining ( IHC ) . The original generation FNB needle study , demonstrate noticeable advantage convention FNA . More recent evolution FNB needle lead promising preliminary result . For obtain EUS-guided liver biopsy ( EUS-LB ) , technical success 100 % 91 % diagnostic accuracy . Furthermore , EUS-LB appear high diagnostic accuracy chronic liver disease ( CLD ) compare percutaneous ( PLB ) transgulular ( TLB ) rout . Overall , EUS-FNB appear promising additional EUS guide tissue acquisition , shall lead improve diagnostic accuracy . In addition EUS-FNB , EUS-FNA stylet use suction , gain notoriety . It important note definitive evidence improve diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA method . One caveat supplemental method EUS-FNA , would use `` wet suction '' technique ( WEST ) EUS-FNA . The wet suction technique involve use 5 milliliter ( mL ) 0.9 % normal saline ( NS ) supplant traditional column air present FNA needle . When compare traditional EUS-FNA , WEST demonstrate increase cellularity cellblock , improve specimen accuracy difference blood contamination compare standard EUS-FNA . Though specifically EUS technique , use heparinized needle PLB liver lesion , describe well . Despite promising result , technique never employ enhancement EUS-FNA . Therefore study heparinized solution ( wet heparin ) shall employ acquisition tissue EUS-LB compare dry heparin convention EUS-LB . It predict EUS-LB wet heparin lead less blood contamination adequate tissue acquisition , compare dry heparin conventional EUS-LB . Primary End Points 1 . Proportion case histologic diagnosis could make base upon amount tissue obtain needle . 2 . Number portal tract ( PT ) specimen 3 . Aggregate specimen length ( ASL ) , length long piece ( LLP ) , degree fragmentation Secondary End Points 1 . Presence visible core specimen 2 . Presence visible clot specimen 3 . Adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) 4 HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS 4.1 Hypothesis It predict EUS-LB wet heparin lead less blood contamination adequate tissue acquisition , compare dry heparin conventional EUS-LB 4 . 2 Specific Aim 1 To determine adequacy EUS-LB use wet dry heparin 4.3 Specific Aim 2 To determine degree blood contamination EUS-LB use wet heparin dry heparin 4.4 Specific Aim 3 To determine adequacy EUS-LB use wet heparin dry heparin 5 PRELIMINARY DATA Heparin flush use previously several patient undergo EUS-guided liver biopsy , core liver tissue obtain . It find needle preparation use heparin flush lead presence less blood contamination tissue therefore improve diagnostic accuracy ability make diagnosis . 6 STUDY DESIGN 6.1 Description This open-labeled , prospective trial compare tissue acquisition adequacy blood contamination EUS-LB use wet heparin ( Group A ) , dry heparin ( Group B ) conventional EUS-LB ( Group C ) . Group A : Needle flush 5mL heparin , leave EUS-FNB needle Group B : Needle flush 5mL heparin , flush air dry Group C : Needle flush solution Subjects shall undergo EUS-LB ( see ) 3 trans-gastric pass total leave lobe , present standard practice . Pass 1 : Group C , Pass 2 : Group B , Pass 3 : Group A . After EUS-LB , tissue sample shall evaluate pas endosongrapher perform EUS-LB tissue length . The tissue fluid wash tissue specimen shall send processing , describe , evaluated primary secondary outcome 2 expert pathologist , blind arm specimen come . Patients shall receive telephone call 7 day EUS-LB evaluate adverse event .</detailed_description>
