	<brief_title>Buprenorphine Maintenance Treatment Opioid Dependence Primary Care : A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buprenorphine maintenance effective treatment opioid dependence , yet diffusion limit . Physician concern induction report barrier , primarily buprenorphine may precipitate withdrawal due partial opioid agonist activity high receptor bind affinity . To minimize risk , guideline recommend in-office assessment monitoring induction . As may feasible ( e.g. , time limitation ) , many patient instruct self-induct home . While may facilitate treatment entry , data at-home induction limit . The study assess effectiveness at-home vs. in-office induction patient enter buprenorphine maintenance Associates Internal Medicine ( AIM ) primary care clinic . Currently , patient receive buprenorphine maintenance AIM part standard clinical practice observational study ( IRB 5258 ) . Most patient insured Medicaid , cover visit , medication ( obtain prescription local pharmacy ) , lab , outside psychosocial treatment cost . In demonstration project , 20 opioid dependent patient randomly assign at-home in-office induction , monitor 12 week . Ancillary psychosocial treatment encourage require . After randomization , AIM clinic NYSPI research visit schedule weekly 4 week , week 8 12 . The primary outcome include comparison proportion patient successfully induct one week initial primary care visit . Secondary outcome include : 1 ) Time stabilization buprenorphine initiation assess : ) Time patient without withdrawal two consecutive day , b ) Time patient opioid free two consecutive week ; 3 ) Retention-in-treatment 4 12 week . Other secondary outcome include patient satisfaction change addiction severity . These data provide important information buprenorphine initiation primary care enable determination treatment effect size prior future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
