	<brief_summary>Preliminary study variety vaccine suggest target accessibility ( potential immunogenicity ) variety solid tumor immune direct approach . However , four primary factor limit generation effective immune mediate anticancer activity therapeutic application : 1. identify and/or target cancer associate immunogen ( ) individual patient 2. insufficient inhibit level antigen present cell prim and/or presentation 3. suboptimal T cell activation proliferation 4. cancer-induced inhibition anticancer immune response afferent efferent limb . In effort overcome limitation , design novel autologous vaccine address inability fully identify cancer associate antigen , antigen recognition immune system ( i.e . antigen immunogen ) , effector potency , cancer-induced resistance . We complete clinical investigation use two different gene vaccine approach induce enhancement tumor antigen recognition demonstrate therapeutic efficacy . Specifically , use GMCSF gene transduce vaccine TGFβ2 antisense gene vaccine , separate trial , demonstrate similar beneficial effect without evidence significant toxicity advance cancer patient . The GMCSF transgene directly stimulate increased expression tumor antigen ( ) enhance dendritic cell migration vaccination site . TGFβ2 blockade follow intracellular TGFβ2 antisense gene expression reduces production immune inhibiting activity vaccine site . These agent never use combination rationale integrate enhancement anticancer immune response concurrently reduction cancer-induced immune suppression conceptually sound . We harvest autologous cancer cell patient advanced refractory cancer . We construct TGFβ2 antisense / GMCSF expression vector plasmid successfully demonstrate preclinical activity vector function follow transfection electroporation irradiation autologous cancer tissue .</brief_summary>
