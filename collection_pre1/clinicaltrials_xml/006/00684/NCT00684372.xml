	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Early detection , treatment , BK virus infection kidney transplantation prevent BK virus associate kidney transplant injury . BK virus associate nephropathy ( BKVN ) estimate cause progressive kidney transplant injury 1-10 % renal transplant recipient . Diagnostic monitoring strategy BKVN still develop . Detectable virus blood polymerase change reaction-test ( PCR ) predictive BKVN . Additionally , PCR provide objective estimate degree infection . If early detection treatment BK virus infection effective preventing subsequent kidney transplant injury study . However , renal injury dysfunction develop late natural course BKVN seem likely screen combination early treatment would beneficial long-term transplant survival . There establish treatment BK virus infection . Nevertheless , kidney transplant patient diagnosed BK virus infection , immunosuppression reduce allow patient immune system handle virus . However , reduction immunosuppression associate rejection . This indicate patient over-immunosuppressed , predispose BKVN . Therefore , compare degree immunosuppression BKVN patient ( over-immunosuppressed ) patient ( over-immunosuppressed ) could yield interesting information . One possibility would quantify patient specific cellular immune response BK virus also viruses ( T cell reactivity ) . Leflunomide ( Arava ) immunosuppressive drug , approve treatment rheumatoid arthritis , use 300,000 patient worldwide . Furthermore , leflunomide use safely humans clinical kidney liver transplantation 300 day . In addition leflunomide 's value prevent rejection , show exert inhibitory effect different virus . Recently publish pilot study suggest leflunomide treatment patient BKVN significantly reduce amount BK virus blood prevents recurrence kidney transplant injury . At Karolinska University Hospital , leflunomide use treatment BKVN , patient , renal function stabilize BK virus load decrease significantly .</brief_summary>
