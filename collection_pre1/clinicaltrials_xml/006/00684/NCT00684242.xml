	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . The drug also design decrease level certain protein blood call cytokine , may result decreased pain . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take lenalidomide capsule morning , without food . Take lenalidomide capsule whole , 4-ounce ( 1/2 cup ) glass water time day . Do break , chew , open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If take much lenalidomide , call study doctor health care provider poison control center right away . You also allow take strong pain killer morphine prescribe study doctor pain . If need 3 dos pain killer 24-hour period , call study doctor . Study Visits : You visit clinic throughout study . At visit , ask return unused study drug empty bottle clinic ask side effect may experience . The last study visit Day 43 Day 57 , depend side effect may experience . The following test procedure perform : On Day 8 : Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test woman able child blood pregnancy test . Day 15 : Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Women able child blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . You complete 5 questionnaire pain , pain symptom , side effect may . The questionnaire take 30 40 minute complete . Women able child blood pregnancy test . Day 22 : Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Women able child blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Day 29 : You complete questionnaire Day 15 . Women able child blood pregnancy test counsel pregnancy precaution risk . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Women able child blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Day 36 : Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Day 43 : Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . You complete questionnaire Day 15 . If last visit , ECG . Women able child blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Day 57 ( necessary ) : You complete questionnaire Day 15 . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . You complete questionnaire Day 15 . If last visit , ECG . Women able child blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Day 71 ( necessary ) : If stop take drug Day 57 , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test do . Length Study : You may take lenalidomide 57 day . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . If female able child take lenalidomide 57 day , require blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test 28 day last dose lenalidomide . The routine blood draw Days 8 , 22 , 36 may do home ( study nurse ) , local doctor 's office , M. D. Anderson . All patient lenalidomide stop take , check every 3 5 week period 1 year . During follow-up visit , certain test procedure perform . These include symptom questionnaire , blood draw routine test , check side effect , pregnancy test woman still able become pregnant . These test do study . Daily Drug Diary Questionnaire : Starting Day 1 end study , complete questionnaire daily symptom pain may experience . It take 5 minute complete time . You also provide drug diary write often take pain medication . You bring complete diary study visit review research nurse . Phone Call Follow-up : You contact telephone home ask question symptom side effect may experience . You call Day 8 ( plus minus 3 day ) , Day 22 ( plus minus 3 day ) Day 36 ( plus minus 3 day ) . The phone call last 10-15 minute time . End-of-Study Visit : You come clinic 28 day last dose lenalidomide follow-up visit . You check side effect , woman able child must negative blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . This investigational study . Lenalidomide approve FDA treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Lenalidomide FDA approve pain relief . Its use study investigational . If experience intolerable pain stop receiving study drug , allow start receive lenalidomide ( study ) . You monitor side effect every 2-3 week medication period 1 year . Up 15 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
