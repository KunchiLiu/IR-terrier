	<brief_summary>More 1 million Americans suffer heart attack year . Although current treatment able stabilize condition heart , none able restore heart function prior heart attack . Adult stem cell , immature cell become many different type cell , may offer potential mean reverse prevent permanent damage cause heart attack . Recent study show promise use adult stem cell bone marrow reverse damage heart muscle cause heart attack , research need assess safety effectiveness stem cell use discover best time administer treatment . This study evaluate safety effectiveness use adult stem cell infusion 2 3 week heart attack improve heart function people recent heart attack common procedure call percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Adult Autologous Stem Cells Treating People 2 3 Weeks After Having Heart Attack ( The Late TIME Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart attack lead cause death men woman United States . A heart attack occur blood flow heart restrict , commonly due blood clot form one coronary artery . If clot become large enough , blood flow heart block almost completely heart muscle area suffer permanent injury death . Although PCI use open block artery restore blood flow heart muscle , may significant amount heart tissue irreversibly damage . Recent study show adult stem cell bone marrow may able improve heart function heart attack . These specialized cell may ability promote blood vessel growth , prevent cell death , transform number tissue , include muscle . After acute heart attack , remodel process initiate heart attempt compensate damage area . Consequently , condition heart muscle several week heart attack may differ considerably heart 's condition acute setting . For patient , delay delivery stem cell 2 3 week heart attack may better initiate treatment acute phase . This study evaluate safety effectiveness place adult stem cell injured heart muscle 2 3 week heart attack improve heart function people recent heart attack PCI . Participation study last 24 month . All participant first undergo baseline assessment include medical history , physical exam , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood draw , echocardiogram , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) test . Participants assign randomly receive stem cell placebo 2 3 week heart attack . The morning stem cell placebo infusion , participant undergo blood draw bone marrow aspiration procedure hip bone collect stem cell . Later day , either stem cell placebo infused catheter damage area heart . For first 24 hour infusion , participant ask wear small ECG machine call Holter monitor . Participants also ask record temperature twice day month infusion . Participants return follow-up visit Months 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 repeat many baseline assessment .</detailed_description>
