	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A disease management program may effective standard therapy improve quality life control symptoms patient cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study disease management program see well work compare usual care patient stage III stage IV lung cancer , stage III stage IV pancreatic cancer , stage III stage IV ovarian cancer , stage III stage IV colorectal cancer , caregiver .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disease Management Program Usual Care Patients With Stage III Stage IV Lung Cancer , Pancreatic Cancer , Ovarian Cancer , Colorectal Cancer , Their Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To examine effect expansion current disease-management program ( DMP ) patient stage III IV lung pancreatic , ovarian , colorectal cancer . - To determine whether difference resource use ( number chemotherapy treatment last 30 day life , number emergency room visit , number day hospice hospitalization ) among patient participate DMP compare receive usual care . - To determine whether difference patient outcome ( health-related quality life , spiritual well , satisfaction care ) among patient participate DMP compare receive usual care . - To determine whether difference caregiver outcome ( mood state , satisfaction care , satisfaction end-of-life care , burden care give ) among caregiver patient participate DMP compare receive usual care . - To determine whether difference patient caregiver outcome remain controlling influence demographic , clinical , organizational covariates . - To determine extent difference patient caregiver outcomes achieve improvement collaboration problem solve . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord type current supportive care ( usual care vs comprehensive disease-management program [ DMP ] ) . - Usual care ( control group ) : Patients undergo usual care determine core cancer team . - DMP ( experimental group ) : Patients undergo systematic approach regard specific domain related disease , focus supportive care symptom management determine multidisciplinary team provider help patient caregiver manage . Patients caregiver interview baseline , 3 , 9 , 15 month . Patients transfer hospice/palliative care treatment complete additional questionnaire time transfer 3 week transfer . If patient death occurs study , caregiver interview 2 month death . Patient resource-use data collect via billing data hospital clinic chart end patient 's participation study via monthly hospital clinical chart review . Hospital visit , chemotherapy use , hospice day also measure patient resource use . Healthcare team member interview weekly measure contact time patient . Team member receive team problem solve team collaboration tool every 4 month 37 month . Key member ( nurse manager physician clinical director ) also interview every 4 month .</detailed_description>
