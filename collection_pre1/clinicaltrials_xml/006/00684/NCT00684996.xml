	<brief_summary>This phase I/randomized phase II trial study side effect best dose bevacizumab see well work give together without MEDI-522 treat patient unresectable metastatic kidney cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab MEDI-522 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab MEDI-522 may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether bevacizumab effective give together without MEDI-522 treat kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without MEDI-522 Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess appropriate dose bevacizumab administer humanized monoclonal antibody MEDI-522 patient unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma previously treat sunitinib malate sorafenib tosylate . ( Phase I ) II . To compare progression-free survival patient treat bevacizumab versus without humanized monoclonal antibody MEDI-522 . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity bevacizumab humanize monoclonal antibody MEDI-522 patient . ( Phase II ) IV . To estimate overall survival RECIST response rate ( i.e. , confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) treatment arm . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study bevacizumab follow randomized phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 humanized monoclonal antibody MEDI-522 IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) bevacizumab determine . PHASE II : Patients stratify accord number prior treatment regimens renal cell carcinoma ( 1 vs 2 ) whether clear cell component ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV arm I RPTD determined phase I , humanize monoclonal antibody MEDI-522 ( 8 mg/kg ) IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
