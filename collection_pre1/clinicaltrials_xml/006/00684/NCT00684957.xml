	<detailed_description>Insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) circumstance act mediator metabolic effect growth hormone . However , evidence suggest GH IGF-1 act differently metabolic pathway . We study difference GH IGF-1 provide therapy growth hormone deficiency adult . Specifically assess either medication impact cardiovascular risk factor impact risk factor differently . Ten adult male age 18-65 growth hormone deficient stable medication stable MRI finding ( event know pituitary mass ) recruit study .</detailed_description>
