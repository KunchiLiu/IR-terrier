	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group study subject age 2 month old SITL , include secondarily-infected laceration , suture wound abrasion . A laceration suture wound exceed 10 cm length surround erythema extend 2 cm edge lesion . Abrasions exceed 100 cm2 total area , maximum 2 % total body surface area subject &lt; 18 year age , surround erythema extend 2 cm edge abrasion . There four study visit occur 12-14 day period . At Baseline visit ( Visit 1 , Day 1 ) , subject randomize receive retapamulin placebo ointment 2:1 ( retapamulin : placebo ) ratio . The 2:1 randomization include minimize number subject expose treatment placebo . Both active treatment placebo dose topically twice daily ( BID ) 5 day . All subject receive telephone call investigator appropriate designee appoint investigator Day 2 . The subject interview determine evidence worsen infection . Subjects think worsen instructed come clinic assessment . Subjects monitor clinically evaluate On-therapy ( Days 3-4 ) , End Therapy ( Days 7-9 ) , Follow-up ( Days 12-14 ) visit .
