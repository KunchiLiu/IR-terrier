	<detailed_description>Docetaxel single-agent therapy ( 100 mg/m2 75 mg/m2 , every 3 week ) produce response rate 26 % 54 % . Docetaxel proven superior compare best supportive care ( BSC ) chemotherapy-naïve well platinum pretreated patient . In addition , docetaxel active cisplatin refractory resistant patient , produce response range 18 % 25 % , imply lack cross-resistance docetaxel cisplatin , probably due different mechanism action . Furthermore , docetaxel associate significant prolongation survival administer second line therapy , pretreated patient advanced NSCLC . Phase II study pemetrexed previously untreated patient NSCLC demonstrate single agent response rate 17 % 23 % . A phase II study pemetrexed patient advanced NSCLC , progress within 3 month complete first-line chemotherapy , demonstrate response rate 8.9 % median survival time 5.7 month . Multivariate analysis establish association increase risk severe pemetrexed toxicity elevate homocysteine ( folate and/or B12 vitamin deficiency marker ) level . Since December 1999 , pemetrexed-treated patient require receive folic acid Vitamin B12 . A recently report phase III study compare pemetrexed docetaxel 2nd line therapy patient advance NSCLC . Treatment pemetrexed result clinically equivalent efficacy outcome , significantly few side effect compare docetaxel .</detailed_description>
