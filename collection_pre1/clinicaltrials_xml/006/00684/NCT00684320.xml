	<detailed_description>Generalized Social Phobia ( GSP ) characterize severe social anxiety lead functional impairment ( Schneider , et al. , 1992 ) . The prevalence GSP 13.3 % ( lifetime , Kessler , et al. , 1994 ) , ranking third among psychiatric disorder . Despite high prevalence , 30 % individual social anxiety need treatment receive treatment variety reason ( e.g. , afraid others might think , Olfson , et al. , 2000 ) . Additionally , 40 % individual present treatment respond ( 39 % Heimberg , et al. , 1998 ; 42 % , Liebowitz et al. , 2005 ) . Thus , clear need develop highly effective efficient treatment procedures social phobia . This three-year proposal aim test computerize treatment social anxiety double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Specifically , research suggest individual social phobia direct attention toward socially-relevant negative information . Therefore , treatment focus change attention bias thereby alleviate symptom social anxiety . We present result pilot study ( n=26 ) treatment seek socially phobic individual demonstrate effectiveness treatment . A large study would allow u test treatment perhaps modify component increase efficacy . The preliminary result pilot encourage . In brief , intervention effective : ) change bias attention socially anxious individual , b ) generalize change disengagement attention threat measure attention disengagement , c ) reduce symptom social anxiety assess independent rater , ) maintain high rate compliance ( 0 % drop pilot study ) , e ) maintain effect follow-up assessment one year . This efficient efficacious technique change attention bias social phobia provide cost-effective easy administer treatment ground basic cognitive science may help reduce suffer individual GSP . We test two hypothesis proposal . 1 ) Individuals GSP complete Attention Disengagement Training ( ADT ) show large reduction symptom compare placebo group interviewer measure social anxiety ( Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale , LSAS ) . 2 ) Individuals GSP complete ADT show large reduction self-report social anxiety symptom compare placebo group</detailed_description>
