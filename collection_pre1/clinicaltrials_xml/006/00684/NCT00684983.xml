	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study capecitabine lapatinib ditosylate see well work compare capecitabine , lapatinib ditosylate , cixutumumab treat patient previously treat human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive stage IIIB-IV breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , block ability tumor cell grow spread . It yet know whether capecitabine lapatinib ditosylate effective give without cixutumumab treat breast cancer spread nearby area body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Lapatinib Ditosylate With Without Cixutumumab Treating Patients With Previously Treated HER2-Positive Stage IIIB-IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival HER2+ breast cancer patient randomize receive lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 HER2+ breast cancer patient . II . To compare overall survival time , time treatment failure , confirm tumor response rate , duration response lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 HER2+ breast cancer patient . III . To assess patient compliance per treatment arm compare overall quality life treatment side effect via patient-reported outcome treatment arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine role expression pattern and/or activation insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) - epidermal growth factor receptor ( ErbB ) family receptor signal molecule formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue predict response lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 . II . To determine role expression pattern and/or activation IGF- ErbB receptor signal molecule circulate tumor cell breast cancer patient predict response lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 . III . To determine role change expression pattern and/or activation IGF- ErbB receptor signal molecule follow treatment lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 circulating tumor cell breast cancer patient predict response lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 . IV . To determine role expression pattern IGF-1 , IGF-II , insulin , growth hormone , IGF bind protein serum breast cancer patient predict response lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 . V. To determine role change expression pattern IGF-1 , IGF-II , insulin , growth hormone , IGF bind protein serum breast cancer patient predict response lapatinib capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 . VI . Banking paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides blood product ( i.e. , serum , plasma , buffy coat ) future study . VII . To assess proportion patient whose pathologic specimens correctly diagnose HER2 positive ( accord 2007 American Society Clinical Oncology [ ASCO ] College American Pathologist [ CAP ] guideline ) metastatic breast cancer . OUTLINE : The first 10 patient enrol study assign cohort I ( safety analysis ) . All patient assign cohort II ( randomize treatment ) . COHORT I ( SAFETY ANALYSIS , close accrual ) : Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 lapatinib ditosylate PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT II ( RANDOMIZED TREATMENT ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive capecitabine PO BID day 1-14 lapatinib ditosylate PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive capecitabine lapatinib ditosylate Arm I . Patients also receive cixutumumab IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
