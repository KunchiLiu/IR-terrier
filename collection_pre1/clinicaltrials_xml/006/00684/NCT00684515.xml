	<criteria>Men woman least 18 year old last cerebral infarction ( exclude cardiogenic cerebral embolism ) occur 14 day less 1 year onset ( time obtain consent ) , stable nervous system 24 hour know course disease . Participants confirm cerebral infarction lesion brain computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Both inparticipant outparticipant Willing give appropriate inform consent complete studyrelated procedure able adhere dose visit schedule . Women childbearing potential ( postmenopausal woman &lt; 1 year menopausal surgical sterilization hysterectomy consider woman childbearing potential ) must agree use medically accept method contraception receive protocolspecified study drug , 60 day completion discontinuation medication . Pregnancy nursing patient ( premenopausal woman negative pregnancy test result confirm enrollment ) Participant serious complication condition investigator feel would cause significant hazard participant study drug administer . Known hypersensitivity component study drug . Participation study use investigational study drug within 30 day obtain consent . Member staff personnel directly involve study Family member study staff . History bleed diathesis , evidence active abnormal bleeding within 30 day obtain consent . History cerebral hemorrhage . Severe hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 200 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg ) . Major surgery within 2 week obtain consent . Known platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm^3 Participants confirm cerebral bleeding cause cerebral bleed brain CT MRI . Participants transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , progressive stroke cardiogenic cerebral embolism . Known impairment renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL [ &gt; 176.8 ( umol/L ] ) , dysproteinemia , nephrotic syndrome , renal disease Active chronic hepatobiliary system hepatic disease , aspartate aminotransferase ( GOT ) alanine aminotransferate ( GPT ) activity two time great upper limit laboratory normal range . Participants contraindictation aspirin . Scheduled PCI ( peripheral coronary intervention ) , peripheral interventional event , carotid endarterectomy , intra extra cranial bypass surgery intravascular surgery ( angioplasty ) study period . Combination therapy unfractionated heparin , tissue plasminogen activator , urokinase , warfarin , factor Xa inhibitor , direct thrombin inhibitor antiplatelet agent aspirin obtain consent , schedule combination therapy . Any serious impairment would make detection new ischemic event difficult ( eg , bedridden participant , participant total nursing care , dementia participant , etc . ) consciousness disturbance may cause aspiration study drug .</criteria>
