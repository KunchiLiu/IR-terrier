	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective To evaluate overall response rate Secondary Objectives To assess safety tolerability To assess duration response To assess progression free survival overall survival STATISTICAL DESIGN : This trial use single stage design differentiate &gt; /= 25 % response rate &lt; /= 5 % rate . If observe data consistent alternative response rate 25 % , imatinib would deem clinically interesting worthy large phase II study .</detailed_description>
