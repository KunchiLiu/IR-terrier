	<brief_summary>Participating subject refer electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) severe depression agree protocol . The control group receive ECT usual . The group receive propofol terminate ECT-induced seizure time seizure last least 25 second . Extensive neuropsychological test do group begin ECT within 48 hour 6th treatment .

	<brief_title>The Effect Cognition Terminating ECT Induced Seizures With Propofol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECT Administration All patient receive ECT administer use Thymatron-System IV ( Somatics , LLC , Lake Bluff , IL ) ECT device , device use usual ECT . All patient monitor continuous electrocardiogram ( EKG ) monitoring , pulse oximetry , regular blood pressure read automatic inflatable cuff one arm . Seizure threshold determine first treatment . The subsequent treatment administer 1.5 time seizure threshold . Stimulus dose increase necessary produce seizure least 20 second observed duration motor activity . All patient whose seizure duration le 20 second motor activity re-stimulated treatment session 50 % increase stimulus intensity unless occur maximum stimulus charge available . All monitoring describe titration process part normal ECT routine . Electrode placement bilateral patient predominate placement use usual patient . Patients standard group receive ECT described elsewhere ( Abrams , 2001 ) . Patients experimental group receive ECT group . However , approximately 15 second stimulus delivery receive 1 mg/kg dose propofol intravenously order terminate brain seizure activity reliably , whether evident surface EEG . In view 30-60 second circulation time limit seizure duration 45-75 sec , generally duration session circulation time individual characteristic . Routine anesthetic agent include hyperventilation 100 % oxygen mask , initial dosage succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV , etomidate 0.2 mg/kg IV , adjust need treatment course . Atropine 0.4-1.0 mg also give intravenously anesthetic agent . Blood pressure pulse assess prior treatment 1 minute , 3 minute , 5 minute follow ECT stimulus periodically thereafter . All patient receive least 6 index ECT . Those needing additional treatment receive standard ECT . Propofol etomidate use normal ECT treatment well atropine succinylcholine . Blood pressure monitoring also part routine ECT . Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) Recording Computer EEG Analysis Four channel EEG data record use bilateral frontal-mastoid bilateral frontal-occipital electrode . Frontal mastoid record electrode use EEG/EMG/ECG Adherent Recording Electrodes . ( Somatics , LLC . ) Occipital electrode use Grass 10mm gold electrode . Preparation occipital area may include use Lemon Prep Skin Prep ( Mavidon Medical LP-0019 ) , Elefix conductive paste ( Niho Kohden America , Inc. ) . Nu Prep Cover Roll stretch ( BSN Medical ) cut facilitate cover electrode . Analysis parameter seizure do software provide manufacturer Thymatron system IV . Our standard ECT include 2 channel EEG record use bilateral fronto-mastoid electrode placement use Adherent Recording Electrodes ( Somatics , LLC ) computer analysis channel 1 . Cognitive Assessment Cognition assess use neuropsychological battery subtests measure difficulties retention newly learn material ( anterograde amnesia ) past event ( retrograde amnesia ) California Verbal Learning Test ( CVLT ) ( subtests : recognition test A &amp; B long delay free recall ) . Wechsler Memory Scale ( WMS III ) ( subtests : Mental Control , Logical Memory recognition , Memory Span ) , Trail Making A &amp; B , Rey Auditory Verbal learn Test , Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test ( copy , recall recognition trial ) . In addition , Hamilton Rating Scale Depression , Clinical Global Improvement ( CGI ) , Modified Mini Mental Status ( 3MSE ) , Autobiographical memory interview , Beck Depression Index ( BDI ) perform . Emergence anesthesia determine measure post-treatment reorientation time time awaken , name recall , orientation location , date day week , time begin end stimulus application . Following awakening , patient ask 1-min interval open eye squeeze investigator 's hand . The time stimulation well time patient open eye performance appropriate response command note . The procedure use identify place date 1-min interval correct answer give question . As soon orientation occur , administer series test evaluate recovery psychomotor function , include Trieger test ( volunteer ask connect series dot ) , P-deletion test ( volunteer ask select letter `` p '' text random letter 180 ) , Digit Symbol Substitution test ( volunteer ask match number symbols 90 ) 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 min cessation anesthesia . These test use previously study recovery anesthesia . At time patient ask evaluate `` sense clear-headedness , '' `` sense energy '' . All assessment carry blind investigator group membership patient . Our standard ECT utilize Mini Mental Status Examination every third ECT measure cognitive change . Cognitive test emerge anesthesia routinely do . All subject receive six individual treatment session give 3 day per week . Investigators aware treatment parameter ; however , independent raters blind treatment administer . Prior experimental treatment session , subject participate several preliminary meeting MD investigator psychologist . Each session use facilitate psychiatric screening , lab test , psychological neuropsychological test order establish baseline memory functioning . The experimental treatment session supervise facilitate MD investigator follow guideline previously develop experimental procedure . Except administration propofol drug follow administration ECT , treatment protocol exactly treatment group . - All treatment session begin occur 7:00 12:00 pm take place Loma Linda University Medical Center-Outpatient Surgery Center . - Patients instruct anything eat drink ( NPO ) midnight night ECT . They may take morning blood pressure medication sip water . - An intravenous ( IV ) line establish . EEG Monitoring electrode , O2 saturation monitor , foot blood pressure cuff put place . Atropine 0.4-1.0 mg IV administer first , etomidate 0.2 mg/kg IV . Succinylcholine 1.0mg/kg IV give soon patient fall asleep . Sleep measured inability arouse patient loss lash reflex . Other medication may use control blood pressure , nausea , etc . - Patient mask 100 % O2 hyperventilate - Approximately ninety second infusion succinylcholine , impedance check use Thymatron stimulus give . - During first ECT session titration procedure do order determine low dose electrical energy produce seizure ( seizure threshold ) . - The second ECT set 50 % seizure threshold . - Subsequent stimulus setting set keep seizure duration 25 second absolute minimum . - Propofol 0.5-1.0 mg/kg administer IV patient experimental group seizure duration reach 15 second measure EEG monitor first six ECTs , include session titration do , seventh ECT control group . - Anesthesiologist continue mask patient patient able adequately breathe . - Patient take recovery area monitor O2 place stable . - Time awaken , time name recall , place recall , date recall assess treatment rater blind treatment condition .</detailed_description>
