	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether use special warm blanket Cesarean delivery help maintain normal body temperature baby compare mother warm ( standard care BC Women 's Hospital ) . Doctors observe baby low body temperature bear Cesarean delivery . Since baby temperature dependant temperature mother , believe keep mother warm surgery use special warm blanket fill warm air result baby warmer birth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Warming Mothers During Cesarean Delivery Help Keep Babies Warm When Delivered ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maternal hypothermia Cesarean delivery predominately cause combination neuraxial anesthesia exposure abdominal content skin low temperature operate room ( OR ) . Since maternal temperature fetal temperature intimately relate , neonates experience hypothermia birth due maternal hypothermia . Neonatal hypothermia admission Intensive Care Unit important determinant morbidity mortality , particularly preterm neonate . At BC Women 's Hospital majority Cesarean deliveries do neuraxial anesthesia pediatrician observe baby suboptimal body temperature time Cesarean delivery . The pediatrician want reverse trend neonatal hypothermia request OR temperature increase 25oC , line World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline delivery room . However , raise OR temperature usually comfortable option majority staff work environment , therefore WHO recommendations follow . Forced air warm common technique use surgical procedure maintain normothermia anesthetized patient . A bi-layered blanket multiple air channel connect warm device force warm air layer blanket ultimately around patient . This device effective warm hypothermic patient maintain temperature normothermic patient cool OR . The study maternal warm Cesarean delivery publish date show inconsistent finding thus subject warrant investigation . We postulate actively warm mother prevent decrease risk neonatal hypothermia birth . In addition , examine whether active warm large effect premature neonate . Neonatal axillary temperature delivery primary outcome . Important variable measure include : neonatal umbilical vein pH , Apgar score , maternal temperature throughout surgery ( uterine incision -delivery time ) , presence maternal shiver maternal thermal comfort score . This study non-blinded , randomize control trial involve two group : 1 . Control group : Standard care i.e . cupboard warm cotton blanket cupboard warm IV fluid . 2 . Intervention group : Standard care control group plus Bair Hugger full access underbody blanket model 635 ( Health Canada Licence # 12692 ) warm Bair Hugger temperature management unit model 750 . Patient lie underbody blanket turn patient supine operate table follow insertion anesthetic . The warm device set medium temperature set ( 380C ) . The intervention group receive force air warm blanket throughout surgery . The study conduct operating room BC Women 's Hospital . The target population consenting , pregnant woman undergo either elective urgent ( immediate threat maternal neonatal life require delivery ) Cesarean delivery spinal combine spinal-epidural anesthesia . Exclusion factor include : emergency Cesarean delivery Cesarean deliveries general anesthesia , mother active labor , mother 19 year old , understand English , lack consent . Mothers suspect infection , Type I Diabetes Mellitus , history malignant hyperthermia disease/disorder know affect temperature regulation also exclude .</detailed_description>
