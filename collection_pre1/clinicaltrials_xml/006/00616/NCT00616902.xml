	<criteria>Stage 5 CKD receive chronic hemodialysis three time per week &gt; = 3 month &lt; = 12 month date Randomization ( Day 1 ) . Serum intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) value 100350 pg/mL . Serum calcium level 8.410.5 mg/dL ( 2.12.6 mmol/L ) . Phosphate &lt; 7 mg/dL . Serum albumin &gt; = 3.0 g/dL ( 30 g/L ) . Echocardiogram result : For female , leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction &gt; = 50 % septal wall thickness 1117 mm . For male , LV ejection fraction &gt; = 50 % septal wall thickness 1218 mm . If subject receive Renin AngiotensinAldosterone System ( RAAS ) inhibitor , dose must stable great one month prior Screening Period . A technically adequate baseline cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . If female , subject breast feeding pregnant , childbearing potential , defined postmenopausal least one year surgically sterile , childbearing potential practice one follow method birth control : Doublebarrier method Hormonal contraceptive least three month prior study drug administration Maintains monogamous relationship vasectomize partner Total abstinence sexual intercourse study . Subject previously active vitamin D therapy ( calcitriol , paricalcitol , doxercalciferol , alfacalcidol ) total duration great three month since start dialysis . Subject history allergic reaction significant sensitivity paricalcitol drug similar study drug . Subject expect receive increase dose RAAS inhibitor ( Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor [ ACEi ] , Angiotensin II receptor blocker [ ARB ] aldosterone inhibitor ) course study . Subject clinically significant coronary artery disease ( CAD ) within 3 month prior Screening Period , define one following : Hospitalization myocardial infarction ( MI ) unstable angina ; New onset angina positive functional study coronary angiogram reveal stenosis ; Coronary revascularization procedure . Subject major cardiac valve abnormality link leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) and/or diastolic dysfunction , define one following : Aortic valve area &lt; = 1.5 cm2 mean gradient &gt; 20 mmHg ; Regurgitation lesion ; moderate mitral regurgitation moderate aortic regurgitation . Subject asymmetric septal hypertrophy . Subject severe cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) within last three month ( e.g. , hemorrhagic ) prior screen . Full remission malignancy le one year except completely excise nonMelanoma skin cancer ( e.g . basal squamous carcinoma ) history bone metastasis . Subject comorbid condition . Subject receive investigational drug within 30 day prior study drug administration currently enrol another clinical trial . Subject poorly control hypertension . Subject history renal artery stenosis , primary aldosteronism pheochromocytoma Subject take calcitonin , bisphosphonates , cinacalcet , glucocorticoid ( except topical inhaled glucocorticoid ) Subject currently receive immunosuppressant therapy and/or high dos glucocorticoid Subject know HIV positive . Use known inhibitor inducer cytochrome P450 3A ( CYP3A ) within two week prior study drug administration Subject contraindicate MRI examination Investigator considers subject unsuitable reason Subject history drug alcohol abuse within six month prior screen Subject weigh 340 pound ( 154 kg ) Subject liver transplant</criteria>
