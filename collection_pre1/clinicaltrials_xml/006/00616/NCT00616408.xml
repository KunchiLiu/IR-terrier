	<brief_summary>In last two decade , somatostatin analog become cornerstone medical therapy acromegaly . One year treatment octreotide-LAR ( LAR ) control GH IGF-I excess 54 % 63 % unselected patient , increase proportion subject achieve IGF-I normalization prolong treatment . Clinically significant tumor shrinkage ( 20-30 % vs. baseline ) also report , high proportion patient treat first-line [ 231 448 patient ( 52 % ) ] treat surgery and/or radiotherapy [ 52 248 patient ( 21 % ) ] . The high rate clinically significant shrinkage ( &gt; 20 % ) occur patient treat first-line LAR ( 80 % ) compare short-lasting octreotide formulation ( 50 % ) lanreotide slow-release formulation ( 35 % . In 99 de novo patient acromegaly , recently report control GH level 57.6 % , IGF-I level 45.5 % great 50 % tumor shrinkage 44.4 % 12 month first-line treatment somatostatin analogue , either LAR lanreotide . Besides different drug use , duration treatment also play important role shrinkage magnitude . In homogeneous cohort 56 patient treat LAR continuously 24 month , note even sustained effect tumor shrinkage : overall , tumor volume decrease 68.1Â±16.5 % use dosage up-titrated 40 mg every 28 day . Despite evidence , still debate use first-line treatment somatostatin analogue . Of paramount importance would possibility predict result one year treatment early treatment begin . Controversy report predictive value initial tumor size , inhibition GH IGF-I level treatment , dose type somatostatin analogue use treatment . We find percent suppression IGF-I 12 month LAR treatment parameter best predict amount tumor shrinkage period , investigate result short-term treatment series . This observational , analytical , open , retrospective study design evaluate predictive value tumor shrinkage , GH IGF-I suppression 3 month Octreotide-LAR ( LAR ) tumor shrinkage obtain 12 month . As secondary parameter also study baseline patient profile age diagnosis , gender , estimate disease duration , GH IGF-I level tumor size .</brief_summary>
