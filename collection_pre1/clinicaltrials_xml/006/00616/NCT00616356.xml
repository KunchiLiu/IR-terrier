	<brief_summary>The investigator Rockefeller University research study immune system respond viruses infectious agent use yellow fever 17D vaccine model . The YFV-17D vaccine one safest effective vaccine know used vaccinate human yellow fever virus ( YFV ) infection since 1930s . By study human immune system respond YFV vaccine hope learn normal function immune system might possible design new , effective type vaccine prevent important infectious disease . The reason research : Currently little information factor determine effectiveness initial ( primary ) immune response foreign substance ( antigen ) , virus , person may expose . There also little known determines effectively long person 's immune system react antigen prevent another infection . Studies animal give u important information immune system animal behave upon initial repeat exposure antigen , topic study detail human . The following hypothesis test : - The magnitude initial expansion T lymphocytes ( `` clonal burst '' ) specific infect virus determines level memory T cell response generate specific viral antigen duration memory T cell response generate body . - The majority CD8 T cell generate immunization yellow fever specific `` bystander activation '' non-specific cell .</brief_summary>
