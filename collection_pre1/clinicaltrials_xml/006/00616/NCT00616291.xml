	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect peptide vaccine treating patient metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic , Progressive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate safety tolerance NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 class-I class-II vaccine administer subcutaneously patient androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer . Secondary - Compare response induce immunotherapy combine class-I class-II NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 vaccine response obtain either class I class II peptides alone . - Evaluate whether inclusion class-II epitope peptide vaccine result well antitumor immune response class-I epitope alone . - Determine antitumor activity antigen response assay include cytokine elaboration , change frequency peripheral T cell recognize tumor , intra/peritumoral cellular infiltrates cytokine expression respond nonresponding metastasis . OUTLINE : Patients receive NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 peptide vaccine subcutaneously every week 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The initial cohort patient treat one course either MHC Class I-binding MHC Class II-binding peptide . If Class I Class II bind peptide safe individually , subsequent cohort patient appropriate HLA type receive type peptide combination . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
