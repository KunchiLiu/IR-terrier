	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide methotrexate , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sunitinib together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose sunitinib give together cyclophosphamide methotrexate see well work treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose combination metronomic dose cyclophosphamide methotrexate continuous dose sunitinib malate . ( Phase I ) - To determine time disease progression patient metastatic breast cancer treat metronomic dose chemotherapy cyclophosphamide methotrexate combine continuous dose sunitinib malate . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To determine response rate patient receive treatment . - To determine duration response patient receive treatment . - To determine toxicity regimen patient . - To determine feasibility assessment toxicity regimen number voluntary withdrawal study . - To correlate outcome measure possible surrogate marker include serial measurement circulate tumor cell circulate endothelial cell . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sunitinib malate . - Phase I : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily . Beginning 14 day later , patient also receive oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-21 oral methotrexate twice daily day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Treatment sunitinib malate , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate repeat every 21 days* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive sunitinib malate maximum tolerate dose determined phase I cyclophosphamide methotrexate phase I . NOTE : *Course 1 include 2 week sunitinib malate alone follow sunitinib malate , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate 21 day Blood sample collect periodically measurement circulate tumor cell , circulate endothelial cell , VEGF level . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 2 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
