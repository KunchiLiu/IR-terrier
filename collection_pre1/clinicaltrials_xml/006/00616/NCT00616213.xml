	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , PR-104 , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Colony-stimulating factor , G-CSF , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy . Giving PR-104 together G-CSF may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose PR-104 give together G-CSF treat patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose PR-104 combination filgrastim ( G-CSF ) patient solid tumor . Secondary - Characterize safety regimen patient . - Evaluate pharmacokinetics PR-104 alcohol metabolite . - Evaluate rate hypoxia various solid tumor use F-MISO PET ( 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography ) imaging . - Assess antitumor toxicity patient . - Collect plasma sample assessment potential biomarkers tumor hypoxia . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study PR-104 . Patients receive PR-104 IV 1 hour day 1 filgrastim ( G-CSF ) day 2 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET scan baseline prior course 3 assess tumor hypoxia . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically course 1 . Samples analyze pharmacokinetics PR-104 identification biomarkers tumor hypoxia . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
