	<brief_title>Identification Genetic Markers Cardiopulmonary Diseases ( Genotype )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two main group participant trial : Group 1 : Patients enrol either previous study : X980515002 study ( Identification Genetic Markers Primary Pulmonary Hypertension ) X030403017 study ( Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) Database ) Group 2 : Participants diagnosis previously list Cardiopulmonary Diseases ≥15 year age Group 1 : For patient blood sample draw result participate current protocol , Identification Genetic Markers Primary Pulmonary Hypertension study ( X980515002 ) , would like use previously obtain blood continue draw sample ( 12mL ; less 3 tablespoon ) ONLY change disease therapy . With disease therapy change , blood drawn baseline , 3-4 month , 6-8 month , 12 month , 24 month visit . These current X980515002 participant WILL sign consent form participate new trial . As X980515002 expire patient , would like use previously obtain data ONLY part study collect result X980515002 study . For patient participated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) Database study ( X030403017 ) , participant WILL also sign consent form participant new trial . We would like use previously obtain data X030403017 part study . With disease therapy change , 12mL ( less 3 teaspoon ) blood sample drawn baseline , 3-4 month , 6-8 month , 12 month , 24 month visit . As X030403017 expire patient , would like use previously obtain data part study collect result X030403017 study . Group 2 : After sign consent form , participant 12mL ( less 3 teaspoon ) blood sample drawn baseline , 3-4 month , 6-8 month , 12 month , 24 month visit . With disease therapy change , blood draw ( 12mL sample ) begin baseline continue 3-4 , 6-8 , 12 , 24 month visit .</detailed_description>
