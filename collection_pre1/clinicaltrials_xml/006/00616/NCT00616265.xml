	<brief_summary>The work hypothesis present study treatment CPAP patient sleep apnea ( IAH &gt; 15 ) AHT-r capable produce significant reduction blood-pressure level . This hypothesis support four proven finding : 1 . -sleep apnea independent risk factor arterial hypertension ( 1 ) . 2 . -The great number RSD , great loss control blood-pressure level ( 1 ) . 3 . -The prevalence sleep apnea patient AHT refractory treatment high ( 11,12 ) . 4 . -Treatment patient sleep apnea AHT-r CPAP succeed significantly reduce blood-pressure level ( small-scale ) study undertake date ( 14,15 ) . 4 . OBJECTIVES Main objective : To evaluate effect treatment CPAP blood-pressure level patient AHT refractory medical treatment . Secondary objective : - To evaluate effect treatment CPAP various element assess BP ( systolic/diastolic ; daytime/nighttime , etc ) circadian profile ( dipper/non-dipper/raiser pattern ; variability homogeneity blood-pressure level , etc ) obtain 24-hour out-patient study ( AMPA ) . - To analyze related variable subgroups patient affect treatment CPAP . - To evaluate effect CPAP level biological variable involve pathogenesis AHT-r ( renin , angiotensin , aldosterone , atrial natriuretic factor , etc ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Treatment Control Refractory Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE . To evaluate effect continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment blood-pressure ( BP ) level patient refractory arterial hypertension ( AHT-r ) . METHODS : Multicenter randomize study parallel group blind final evaluation . Patients recruit AHT , nephrology internal medicine outpatient clinic satisfy criterion AHT-r ( patient require 3 anti-AHT drug recommend dos maintain blood-pressure level within AMPA [ 24-hours ambulatory monitoring blood pressure value ) exclude form secondary AHT patient incapacitate hypersomnia need immediate treatment . In , 210 patient include ( 105 per arm intention treat analysis ) accordance calculation sample size need include drop-outs evaluate clinically significant minimum drop 4-5 mmHg mean BP number center ( 21 center ; 10 patient per center ) . They subject complete clinical history , AMPA study , blood test ( serum retain later determination biological mediator ) sleep study . Those patient AHI &gt; 15 randomized receive CPAP vs habitual control . The treatment last 3 month . The variable measure randomization analyze purpose comparison . The comparison result undertaken basis intention-to-treat per-protocol analysis base adherence CPAP treatment different cutoff hour /day mean ANOVA two-way analysis ( one time ) .</detailed_description>
