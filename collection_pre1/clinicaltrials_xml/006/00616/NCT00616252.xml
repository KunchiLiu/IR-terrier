	<detailed_description>In HIV-infected woman , use combination therapy antiretrovirals ( ARV ) pregnancy prevents HIV related morbidity mortality prevent mother-to-child transmission HIV virus.1 Specifically , suppression virus undetectable level important delivery baby minimize potential HIV exposure . Commonly prescribed ARV therapy Ugandan pregnant woman include combination two NRTIs , along non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , nevirapine . In Sub-Saharan Africa , use nevirapine contain regimen cornerstone current ARV therapy , due affordable cost , availability fix dose combination pill , generic availability . Maintaining efficacy prevent development resistance agent HIV virus imperative , second line therapy often difficult obtain , expensive , present challenge drug storage clinic community . Data demonstrate high exposure nevirapine associate great likelihood achieve virologic control well maintain virologic response long term , sub-optimal drug level may result development viral resistance.2 The use combination therapy important due development resistance see use single dose therapy nevirapine delivery.3 Resistance nevirapine particularly worrisome due cross-resistance nevirapine NNRTIs , potentially eliminate one essential class ARVs use treat HIV . Evaluating nevirapine exposure also important avoid toxicity related excess level nevirapine , may compromise patient adherence regimen put woman risk virologic failure addition increase drug toxicity.4 , 5 To knowledge , study date evaluate pharmacokinetics first dose nevirapine HIV-infected pregnant woman delivery.6,7 Other study sample time fully characterize pharmacokinetic parameter nevirapine . However , previous study demonstrate pharmacokinetic change occur ARVs metabolize metabolic path similar nevirapine . For example , one publish study demonstrate low level nelfinavir disproportionate amount nelfinavir M8 metabolite pregnant woman third trimester , possibly implicate alteration cytochrome P450 enzyme system responsible nelfinavir nevirapine metabolism.8 , 9 Given evidence similarly metabolize drug , important definitively characterize nevirapine pharmacokinetics ensure safe use drug pregnancy . Data also demonstrate direct correlation zidovudine intracellular triphosphate concentration change CD4 cell count therapy well direct correlation lamivudine intracellular triphosphate concentration decline HIV RNA plasma.10 Data also show wide inter-patient variability concentration NRTIs , adjust concentration base therapeutic drug monitoring result improved virologic outcome patients.11 , 12 No information know intracellular triphosphorylated concentration NRTIs pregnant female . We seek establish necessity evaluation intracellular level NRTI agent pregnant population research . The available pharmacokinetic data date , primarily evaluate male population western world . We begin understand complex pharmacogenomic mechanism play role pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics . Efavirenz , also NNRTI , nevirapine identify different pharmacokinetic property African patient compare American , European , South American patients.13,14 These change play significant role long term efficacy toxicity agent use widespread basis Sub-Saharan Africa . Evaluating change African woman pregnancy also essential female represent predominant gender impact HIV Sub-Saharan Africa . These change pregnancy may impact safety agent pregnant female level higher expect , may also impact mother-to-child transmission rate long term use agent level low desire . Pregnancy add another dimension challenge treat woman HIV , physiologic metabolic change impact pharmacokinetics antiretroviral agent . Proposed mechanism include absorption change due prolong gastric intestinal emptying time , decrease gastric acid secretion , increase mucus secretion ; increase volume distribution drug cause increased total body water fat , decrease plasma protein concentration ; change elimination relate stimulation hepatic microsomal enzyme inhibition microsomal oxidase ; effect fetus include compartmentalization drug fetus placenta , biotransformation drug fetus placenta , additional elimination drug fetus.15,16 Though physiologic metabolic change know exist , trial evaluate effect factor pharmacokinetics antiretroviral agent impact yet demonstrate . Few pharmacokinetic study undertaken date Sub-Saharan Africa , though become recognize order support antiretroviral rollout program , study essential safe effective long-term use agent . The University Makerere , Infectious Diseases Institute , establish strong foundation pharmacokinetic work take place Uganda development pharmacokinetic laboratory become lead resource pharmacokinetic work Sub-Saharan Africa . This make Makerere University logical location essential evaluation . One first study evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter African patient perform co-investigators Joint Clinical Research Center Kampala , establish pharmacokinetic evaluation drug African population necessary logistically feasible ( 22 ) . We wish evaluate physiologic change occur pregnancy impact pharmacokinetics stavudine , lamivudine , nevirapine compare non-pregnant , HIV-infected Ugandan female . Evaluation drug concentration steady state , instead single dose essential , patient maintain medication throughout pregnancy ensure complete virologic suppression time delivery . These data imperative ensure adequate viral suppression throughout pregnancy minimize likelihood development viral resistance engender inadequate drug concentration</detailed_description>
