	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone Treating Patients With Pituitary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess effect rosiglitazone maleate core biochemical parameter , 24-hour urinary free cortisol level , patient recurrent uncured pituitary-dependent Cushing disease . ( Group 1 ) - To assess effect drug corticotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated pituitary tumor ACTH secretion patient recurrent uncured pituitary-dependent Cushing disease . ( Group 1 ) - To assess effect drug tumor growth patient non-secreting pituitary macroadenoma ( &gt; 10 mm ) use RECIST criterion . ( Group 2 ) - To assess effect drug pituitary tumor gonadotropin ( i.e. , follicle-stimulating hormone , leuteinizing hormone , alpha-subunit ) secretion patient non-secreting macroadenoma . ( Group 2 ) - To assess overall safety tolerability drug cohorts patient . - To assess overall quality life , term performance status treatment , cohorts patient use Karnofsky performance index . OUTLINE : Patients group accord adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) -secreting status ( yes [ Group 1 ] v [ Group 2 ] ) . - Group 1 ( ACTH-secreting adenoma ) : Patients receive 4 mg oral rosiglitazone maleate daily week 1 8 mg daily begin week 2 continue 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 2 ( non-secreting macroadenomas ) : Patients receive 4 mg oral rosiglitazone maleate daily week 1 8 mg daily begin week 2 continue 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo collection blood urine sample baseline completion study therapy ass pituitary function , thyroid function , 24-hour urinary free cortisol level . Additional assessment include corticotrophin-stimulation testing , dynamic pituitary function test ( i.e. , arginine/growth-hormone releasing-hormone testing ) measure growth hormone secretion , overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test measure 8 a.m. serum cortisol level . Patients also undergo MRI baseline completion study therapy examine effect rosiglitazone maleate treatment pituitary tumor size . Patients complete questionnaire baseline monthly study evaluation headache . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15 patient ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor 15 patient non-secreting pituitary macroadenomas accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinically demonstrable pituitary tumor , include either follow subtypes : ACTHsecreting adenoma Residual recurrent disease ≥ 1 month prior pituitary surgery Clinically demonstrable tumor , evidence following : Elevated 24hour urinary free cortisol ( UFC ) level Lack suppression 8 a.m. serum cortisol &lt; 1.8 µg/dL administration dexamethasone 1 mg 11 p.m. previous night Tumor demonstrate MRI perform without contrast and/or inferior petrosal sinus sample evidence central ACTH source . Normal visual field evaluation Goldman perimetry Hypopituitarism allow evidence follow : Subnormal growth hormone ( GH ) response arginine/GHreleasing hormone testing ( normal response increase 26 ng/me ) Low age sexmatched IGF1 level Low thyroidstimulating hormone , free triiodothyronine , free thyroxine level Low estradiol level Low leuteinizing hormone ( LH ) low folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level postmenopausal female patient OR low testosterone , LH , FSH level male patient Patients Cushing disease ( i.e. , harbor ACTHsecreting pituitary adenoma ) must meet following criterion : Hypercortisolemic ( i.e. , uncured ) despite ≥ 1 pituitary surgery Refuse undergo pituitary irradiation and/or bilateral adrenalectomy Refuse alternate steroidlowering therapy ketoconazole and/or metyrapone . Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective contraception least 2 month prior , , 1 month completion study therapy . Nonsecreting pituitary adenoma Newly diagnose disease residual tumor prior surgical debulking Patients underwent prior surgical debulking must ≥ 3 month postsurgery More 10 mm widest diameter ( i.e. , macroadenoma ) , demonstrate pituitary MRI perform without gadolinium Must able undergo pituitary MRI ( group 2 ) More 2 month since prior blood donation &gt; 400 mL More 1 month since prior unlicensed drug participation clinical trial use investigational drug More 3 month since prior rosiglitazone maleate thiazolidinedione Patients diagnose hypopituitarism ( except postmenopausal female ) require initiate hormonereplacement therapy ( HRT ) 6month duration study discontinue HRT end 6 month reevaluate hypopituitarism Acromegaly demonstrate normal serum insulinlike growth factor1 ( IGF1 ) level Cushing disease demonstrate normal 24hour UFC cortisol level Prolactinoma demonstrate normal moderately elevate prolactin level ( moderate elevation serum prolactin [ &lt; 200 ng/mL ] occur nonsecreting tumor due pituitary stalk displacement ) clinically significant renal , hematologic , cardiac , hepatic abnormality within past month active malignancy within past five year except basal cell carcinoma carcinoma situ cervix evidence drug alcohol abuse prior current medical condition may interfere conduct study evaluation result , opinion Investigator Data Safety Monitoring Board compliance officer postmenopausal female receive HRT pregnant nursing history immunocompromise , include know HIV positivity measure enzymelinked immunosorbent assay western blot active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection history noncompliance medical regimen , potentially unreliability , inability complete study prior concurrent radiotherapy pituitary tumor concurrent pituitary surgery</criteria>
