	<brief_title>Sunitinib Maintenance Therapy After Induction Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Patients With ES-SCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite high initial response rate , patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer treat standard chemotherapy develop disease progression , usually within one year initial treatment . Therefore , prolong progression-free survival disease meaningful clinical trial explore agent sunitinib . Sunitinib drug inhibits biological pathway responsible growth spread cancer cell . For reason , believe sunitinib maintenance therapy delay prevent recurrence prolong survival . The goal study determine progression-free survival rate patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer achieve complete response , partial response , stable disease previous platinum chemotherapy regimen , cisplatin carboplatin combination etoposide irinotecan . In addition , safety effectiveness sunitinib also evaluate .</detailed_description>
