	<brief_title>Efficiency Preoxygenation Obese Patients : Pressure Assisted Versus Traditional Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional pre-oxygenation obese patient proven allow time apnea far reduce compare patient closer ideal body weight . This effect attributable several factor : - Reduced FRC - Increased closing capacity - Diminished tidal volume due increase resistance airway , diminish compliance thoracic cage diminish strength endurance respiratory muscle . - Increase atelectasis formation upon induction general anaesthesia . - Increased O2 consumption due increase workload respiratory muscle general increase metabolism . - Increase true shunt . Studies demonstrate reduction atelectasis formation application CPAP pre-oxygenation PEEP anaesthesia . Also , 25ยบ inclination patient supine position , operate table , demonstrate prolongation time apnea significant amount . Outside operating room , PEEP 5 cmH2O demonstrate useful prolonging time apnea use pre-oxygenation hypoxic patient require tracheal intubation intensive care . Yet , study evaluate BiPAP operate room set effect FeO2 tolerance patient . Thus , intent evaluate efficiency application inspiratory assistance pressure 4cmH2O PEEP 4cmH2O 3 minute pre-oxygenation trial level FeO2 attain , rate attainment FeO2 &gt; 90 % tolerance patient procedure , compare 3 minute trial traditional method . For purpose , consent , non pre-medicated obese patient schedule surgery operate ward institution bring earlier operating room , day surgery . In idle operating room , go two trial 100 % O2 pre-oxygenation last 3 minute , interval 20 minute patient rest semi-sitting position , breathe spontaneously ambient air . The order two trial randomly assign standard pre-oxygenation v BiPAP pre-oxygenation . Both patient anesthesia assistant provide pre-oxygenation blind ongoing trial . Data anesthesia machine record visually analyse subsequently blind third party . During trial , comfort patient local 4 point scale grade every minute . At end study period , patient return wait area operate ward schedule time surgery . The protocol intend interfere plan anesthesia technique surgery way .</detailed_description>
