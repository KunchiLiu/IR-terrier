	<brief_summary>This research do find treatment consist combination thoracic radiotherapy cetuximab , give together , follow chemotherapy docetaxel cetuximab ( also give together ) kill cancer cell patient 's body shrink size tumor without cause unacceptable side effect . This may allow patient live long decrease frequency and/or severity symptom cause cancer without increase frequency and/or severity symptom cause treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Plus Conformal Thoracic Radiotherapy Patients ( Pts ) With Inoperable Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( LA - NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ask spend six month study . There 4 different phase study follow : ( 1 ) Loading Phase : This first week ( week 1 ) study , patient receive first ( load ) dose cetuximab , vein . ( 2 ) Concurrent Phase : During phase patient treat simultaneously ( concurrently ) radiation therapy chest cetuximab . Radiation deliver 5 day week , Monday Friday total 7 week ( week 2-8 ) . Cetuximab deliver vein , weekly , week radiation . ( 3 ) Recovery Phase : Patients receive treatment next 3 week ( week 9-11 ) . This phase design allow patient recover side effect start last phase . ( 4 ) Consolidation Phase : The last phase . Patients receive 3 dos chemotherapy docetaxel phase . Docetaxel give intravenously every 21 day . Patients also receive weekly cetuximab phase . Cetuximab deliver similar way concurrent ( second ) phase study . In total , phase last 6 week ( week 12-18 ) . Once therapy treatment complete , patient 's cancer get bad , follow visit include visit physician every three month 2 year , every 4 month 2 year , long cancer n't get bad ( time remove study ) .</detailed_description>
