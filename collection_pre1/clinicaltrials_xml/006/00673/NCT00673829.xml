	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect data safety effectiveness 2nd generation designer T cell patient breast cancer . Designer T cell prepare collect white blood cell participant , modify cell laboratory recognize tumor antigen ( CEA ) . These modified cell give back participant attack kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>T cell penetrate virtually every biologic space power dispose normal malignant cell see viral autoimmune disease rare spontaneous remission cancer . However , T cell easily tolerized self tumor antigens `` immune surveillance '' manifestly fail every cancer clinically apparent . It goal study supply specificity affinities patient T cell without regard `` endogenous '' T cell receptor repertoire , direct antibody-defined recognition kill malignant cell base expression antigen . We achieve prepare chimeric IgCD28TCR gene mammalian expression vector yield `` designer T cell '' normal patient cell . Prior study model system demonstrate recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modify T cell respond antigen target IL2 secretion , cellular proliferation , cytotoxicity , hallmark effective , self-sustaining immune response . It therefore become paramount interest extend study human system widespread clinical relevance explore clinical potential new technology . The target antigen study carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , prominently express tumor stomach , colon rectum , breast , pancreas site . For Phase Ia component , patient receive single dose gene-modified autologous T cell dose-escalation trial . Doses 10^9 10^10 modify T cell . Patients monitor safety response . Patients on-study one month dosing . For Phase Ib component , patient receive fix dose gene-modified T cell ( 10^11 cell ) , randomize receive T cell growth factor interleukin 2 ( +IL2 ) [ Experimental ] ( -IL2 ) [ Control ] . The IL2 administer outpatient continuous infusion two-week period . On Day +2 Day +10 , patient 's tumor biopsied assess designer T cell presence tumor mean judge benefit add IL2 . Patients also follow tumor response .</detailed_description>
