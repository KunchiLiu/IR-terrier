	<brief_summary>The principal objective safely determine identify severity Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) early course disease . Once enrol , draw blood urine relevant biomarkers . Our goal validate biomarkers predict course AKI ( recovery v. RRT v. death )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol Assess Severity Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AKI common disease intensive care unit . However , despite advance supportive care , patient AKI carry high mortality rate ( 50 % 70 % ) . The establish AKI affect nearly 5 percent hospitalize person many 15 percent critically ill patient . Currently , FDA approve therapeutic agent treatment AKI . Retrospective study suggest early initiation renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) improve outcome . Many clinician tend take `` wait see '' approach want dialyze patient destine recover renal function without need RRT . Therefore , vitally important know early course patient AKI likely progress RRT .</detailed_description>
