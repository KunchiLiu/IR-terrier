	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vorinostat may stop growth cancer cell interfere various protein need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , gemtuzumab ozogamicin ( GO ) , block cancer growth different way . GO finds cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving vorinostat together gemtuzumab ozogamicin may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give vorinostat together gemtuzumab ozogamicin work treat old patient previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine CR/CRi rate treatment vorinostat plus GO . ( Good risk group ) II . To determine 30-day survival treatment vorinostat plus GO . ( Poor risk group ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate frequency severity regimen-associated toxicity , along 30-day survival start treatment vorinostat plus GO . ( Good risk group ) II . To determine CR/CRi rate treatment vorinostat plus GO , estimate frequency severity regimen-associated toxicity . ( Poor risk group ) III . To investigate relapse-free survival patient achieve CR/CRi receive maintenance therapy study . IV . To define cellular factor associate clinical response GO/vorinostat determine mechanism underlie synergistic effect GO vorinostat primary AML cell ( vitro correlative mechanistic study ) . OUTLINE : REMISSION INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive oral vorinostat daily day 1-9 gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV 2 hour day 8 . Treatment repeat every 15-22 day 3 course . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Beginning within 60 day completion remission induction therapy , patient receive oral vorinostat daily day 1-9 gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV 2 hour day 8 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive oral vorinostat daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course . All treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
