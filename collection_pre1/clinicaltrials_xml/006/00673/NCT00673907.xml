	<brief_summary>The study intend focus health effect symptoms related particle exposure wood burn stoves The objective determine whether moderate exposure particle wood smoke real life situation cause systemic inflammatory response peripheral blood low airway . 24 healthy subject ( normal healthy subject mild asthmatic study asthmatic response ) select study . A randomized double blind crossover procedure follow PM exposure concentration 200ug/m3 , 400ug/m3 clean air control exposure . Exposure take place climate chamber use wood burn appropriate wood stove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Public health concern physical , mental environmental health community population risk disease injury . Generally , determination health effect associate indoor outdoor exposure difficult since document cause-and-effect relationship rare exposure dosage data sparse . Information actual human exposure different type pollution several important us , include inform risk assessment , help predict potential consequence exposure , develop exposure criterion regulation public policy guidance . Wood-burning stove popular heat source decade . Unfortunately , wood-burning stove emit substantial quantity pollutant outdoor indoor air . Among pollutant : chlorinate dioxin , carbon monoxide , methane , volatile organic compound ( VOC ) , nitrogen oxide , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) , fine particulate matter ( PM10 , PM2.5 , fine ultra fine particle ) . Recent study indicate use wood-burning stove heat dwelling one important outdoor particle source [ Glasius et al . 2004 ] residential district Denmark . This result increase public exposure indoor outdoor wood smoke related pollutant , prompt widespread concern adverse human health consequence may associate wood smoke exposure . Air pollution major aggravation respiratory symptom disease . Effects decrease pulmonary function evidence inflammation well suggestion increase chronic respiratory disease . Orozco-Levi et al . ( 2006 ) show strong association wood smoke exposure obstructive pulmonary disease . Several study show especially small particle , effect airway , asthmatic subject may group great risk air pollutant . The awareness impact airborne particle , particularly fine ultra fine particle , health grow . In recent year , exposure fine ultra fine airborne particle identify important factor affect human health [ Seaton et al. , 1995 ; Schwartz et al. , 1996 ; Oberdörster et al. , 1994 ; Alvin et al. , 2000 ] . Several researcher hypothesize increased mortality associate particle level prevail urban air [ Jamriska et al. , 1999 ; Dockery et al. , 1993 ] . Mølhave et al ( 2000 ; 2005 ) suggest reactive short-lived compound result reaction ozone particulate matter cause indoor air quality complaint objective health effect impair lung function . Particulate air pollution also know increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Still exist scientific knowledge foundation evaluate underlie mechanisms influence particle exposure human immune system limit . Wood smoke particle , level find smoky indoor environment , seem affect inflammation . Barregard et al observe significant increase S-Amyloid Faktor VIII/vWf 0 , 3 20 hour exposure wood smoke . After 20 hour also increase Faktor VIII registred . Surpise-lingly , IL.-6 decrease observe 3 hour . [ Barregard et al , 2006 ] . The particle may also act increase blood coagulation factor [ Seaton et al 1995 ] . Both effect may involve mechanism whereby particulate air pollution affect cardiovascular morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
