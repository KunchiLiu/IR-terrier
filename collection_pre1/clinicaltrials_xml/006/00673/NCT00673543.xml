	<detailed_description>Preterm birth occur 25 % woman insulin require diabetes pregnancy . The administration corticosteroid therapy accelerate fetal lung maturation indicate woman risk preterm birth . Although corticosteroid therapy significantly decrease risk respiratory distress syndrome newborn , therapy lead transient elevation maternal glucose level , potentially result life-threatening maternal metabolic abnormality , low oxygen level fetus , extreme case , stillbirth . Because elevation glucose level may drastically increase short period time , intense monitoring maternal glucose level achieve strict glycemic control treatment prefer use insulin . The purpose study compare timing , duration severity maternal hyperglycemia corticosteroid administration woman insulin-requiring diabetes compare without diabetes pregnancy . This prospective , observational study . Hourly glucose level obtain total 7 day corticosteroid administration use Dexcom Seven continuous glucose monitoring system . In addition , hemoglobin A1C obtain assess overall level glycemic control participant prior corticosteroid therapy . The study group include pregnant woman &gt; 18 year age insulin-requiring diabetes receive corticosteroid therapy accelerate fetal lung maturation 24 34 week pregnancy . Only woman active labor singleton gestation include . A control group comprise pregnant woman singleton gestation without insulin-requiring diabetes receive corticosteroid therapy also accelerate fetal lung maturation . Women exclude diet control diabetes , twin high gestation , active labor anticipate imminent delivery , previously form steroid therapy , receive beta-adrenergic medication .</detailed_description>
