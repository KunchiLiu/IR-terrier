	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate endothelial function autonomic regulation ( example , heart rate blood pressure ) smokers short-term smoking cessation . The endothelium thin layer cell line interior surface blood vessel . The endothelium release nitric oxide , promote dilation blood vessel inhibit inflammation . Previous study show tobacco use associate endothelial dysfunction , tobacco use increase heart rate blood pressure . We hypothesize 2 week smoke cessation improve endothelial function . We also determine endothelial function autonomic regulation short-term smoking cessation differs patient achieve abstinence smoking cessation agent varenicline compare placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endothelial Function Autonomic Regulation After Short-term Smoking Cessation : Varenicline Versus Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking major cardiovascular risk factor associate arterial endothelial dysfunction , key event atherosclerosis . Previous observation suggest smoking-related endothelial dysfunction dose-related potentially reversible withdrawal smoking . To knowledge , data available regard potential improvement arterial endothelial function first week smoke cessation . This time frame especially important due smoke-free policy healthcare facility , smoker require surgery abstinent tobacco least period time . Varenicline , partial agonist α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetyl-choline ( nAChR ) receptor , receive FDA approval novel medication help cigarette smoker stop smoking . Given anticipated common use varenicline , important define drug alters endothelial function and/or autonomic effect . Based less potency varenicline ( compare nicotine ) nAChR receptor peripheral ganglia endothelial cell blood vessel , may hypothesize varenicline less influence autonomic control blood pressure heart rate , less influence endothelial function . Therefore , aim study 1 ) determine effect short-term smoke cessation endothelial function autonomic regulation , 2 ) determine effect alter treatment varenicline .</detailed_description>
