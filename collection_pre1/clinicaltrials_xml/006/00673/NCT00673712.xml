	<detailed_description>Nosocomial infection recognize important cause increase patient morbidity mortality . The reported prevalence nosocomial infection commonly range 5 20 % , significantly great among patient require intensive care . The common site hospital acquired infection include lung , urinary tract , surgical wound , bloodstream . Patients undergoing cardiac surgery appear increase risk development nosocomial infection due presence multiple surgical wound ( chest low extremity incision ) , frequent postoperative utilization invasive device ( i.e . central venous catheter , chest drain , intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation , pulmonary artery catheter ) , common use prophylactic empiric antibiotic perioperative period . In cardiac surgical postoperative period , nosocomial infection find associated prolonged length stay ( LOS ) ICU total hospitalization , development multiorgan dysfunction , increase hospital mortality . Nosocomial Pneumonia ( NP ) fact lead cause mortality due hospital-acquired infection . Patients Ventilator Associated Pneumonia ( VAP ) find various study significantly high mortality rate without VAP , range 20.2-45.5 % 8.5-32.2 % , respectively . Strategies reduce postoperative pain sedation potential reduce postoperative pneumonia allow early extubation effective pulmonary toilet post-extubation . Non-opioid pain management potential reduce NP rate superior pain management , well reduction opioids require , concomitant avoidance opioid side effect . The clinical financial consequence NP justify aggressively pursue strategy aim prevention . Specifically , strategy target reduce incidence NP address modifiable risk factor include prolonged endotracheal intubation ventilator support , sedation , long hospital LOS .</detailed_description>
