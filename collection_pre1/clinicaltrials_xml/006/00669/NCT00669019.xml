	<brief_title>Saracatinib Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether Src kinase inhibitor , AZD0530 ( saracatinib ) , single agent clinical activity patient advance melanoma . II . To determine whether drug increase progression-free survival patient 3 month 4.5 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether drug may inhibit activation peripheral blood T cell analyze ex vivo . OUTLINE : Patients receive saracatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
