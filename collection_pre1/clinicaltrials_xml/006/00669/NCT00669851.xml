	<brief_title>Acquiring Consensus Contrast Echocardiography System Settings - ACCESS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because quality AI-700-enhanced image part determine ultrasound ( US ) settings selection , continue study different image mode and/or technique require order provide US setting recommendation many available system . Therefore AI-700-enhanced imaging perform study use image platform modes previously test AI-700 dose administration method employ previous Phase 3 study . Two cohort subject study site . Enrollment commence Cohort A include normal ( healthy ) volunteer stable cardiac patient . Settings optimization perform Cohort A use single platform real-time imaging . If Sponsor agree image setting acquire Cohort A acceptable , site authorize begin enrollment Cohort B use platform setting define Cohort A . Authorized sit enrol stable cardiac patient Cohort B ; healthy volunteer study . For Cohort B subject , first 0.04 mL/kg dose AI 700 use evaluate real-time imaging setting define Cohort A . The second dose AI-700 Cohort B subject may use confirm data obtain first dose , explore image second mode ( e.g . 3D/4D ) and/or use real-time , high mechanical index trigger image second platform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Cohort A , men nonpregnant/nonlactating woman good health 18 70 year age low chance CAD enrol . For Cohort B , men nonpregnant/nonlactating woman good health 1870 year age prior MI and/or coronary artery revascularization intervention &gt; 90 day AI700 administration , without new recurrent angina enrol . Healthy volunteer Cohort A follow condition exclude study : clinically significant intracardiac shunt cardiovascular structural and/or severe functional abnormality Qualification Echo , unless deem clinically relevant Investigator subsequently approve Sponsor ; ejection fraction ( EF , estimate Qualification Echo ) ≤55 % ( outside normal range ) , history clinical manifestation significant mental illness significant pulmonary , hematological , renal , hepatic , central nervous , cardiovascular , genitourinary , gastrointestinal disorder , diabetes ; history major surgical procedure within 90 day Screening/Baseline ; body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 35 ; sit systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg &gt; 150 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg &gt; 95 mmHg , pulse rate &lt; 45 bpm &gt; 90 bpm ; oxygen saturation &lt; 92 % rest ; inadequate image quality Qualification Echo . Other exclusion criterion include : participation investigational drug/device study within 30 day prior dose ( 90 day UK site ) , participation previous clinical trial AI700 , nonseasonal asthma within past 3 year recent seasonal asthma require prescription medication , frequent ( &gt; 5/min ) premature ventricular atrial contraction ( PVC , PAC ) , ≥2nd AV block , bundle branch block ( BBB ) , rhythm abnormality . Stable cardiac patient Cohorts A B follow condition exclude study : clinically unstable condition major surgery within 30 day prior Screening/Baseline ( include limit severe arterial hypertension , pulmonary hypertension , increase pulmonary pressure due increase pulmonary resistance , hypotension , bradycardia , tachycardia , unstable angina ) ; cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within 90 day prior dose ; congestive heart failure grade New York Heart Association Class 3 4 within 90 day prior dose ; significant leave main CAD ( ≥50 % stenosis ) ; moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) within 6 month prior dose ; oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % rest ; inadequate image quality Qualification Echo . Candidates clinically significant intracardiac shunt cardiovascular structural and/or severe functional abnormality per Qualification Echo [ include intra cardiac shunt ; uncorrected congenital heart disease ( i.e. , severe valvular disease ; large amount pericardial effusion ] , EF ( estimate Qualification Echo ) &lt; 40 % ; also eligible participate . Subjects exhibit new change ECG abnormality time Screening AI700 dose similarly exclude . Other exclusion criterion include : participation investigational drug/device study within 30 day prior dose ( 90 day UK site ) , participation previous clinical trial AI700 , nonseasonal asthma within past 3 year recent seasonal asthma require prescription medication , organ transplant endstage organ failure , active seizure disorder . Candidates also exclude uncontrolled atrial fibrillation , frequent ( &gt; 5/min ) PVCs PACs , history prolong QT/QTc ( &gt; 500 msec ) , use automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator , ≥2nd AV block , BBB , rhythm abnormality evaluate treated specialist current treatment adequately effective extent subject safety assure .</criteria>
