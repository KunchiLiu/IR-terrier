	<brief_summary>Following radical prostatectomy lymph node sampling , eligible patient undergo post-operative radiation therapy , concurrent weekly docetaxel chemotherapy , hormonal therapy ( Casodex daily Zoladex every 3 month 2 time Lupron 22.5 mg im every 3 month 2 time ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Radiation Therapy , Hormonal Therapy Concurrent Docetaxel High Risk Pathologic T2-T3N0 Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine safety feasibility combine post-operative radiation therapy , hormonal therapy ( 6 month ) concurrent docetaxel men high risk pathologic T2-3N0 prostate cancer radical prostatectomy . To obtain preliminary information regard efficacy combine weekly docetaxel adjuvant radiation therapy hormonal therapy men high risk pathologic T2-3N0 prostate cancer determine PSA failure free survival . To assess baseline longitudinal change health-related quality life outcome therapy ( 3 , 6 , 12 24 month )</detailed_description>
