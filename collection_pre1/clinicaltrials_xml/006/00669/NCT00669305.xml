	<detailed_description>These study design evaluate potential retroviral vector mediate gene transfer , gene editing , drug treatment correct pathophysiology sickle cell anemia β-thalassemia . CD34+ cell purify bone marrow research participant sickle cell syndrome thalassemia syndrome subject genetic editing , drug treatment , transduce retroviral vector contain γ-globin coding sequence control β-globin gene promoter include various regulatory element choose enhance gene expression insulate regulatory element cellular gene near integration site . The efficiency gene transfer function globin transgene evaluate erythroid cell derive transduced progenitor progenitor bone marrow immunodeficient mouse engraft transduced , primitive hematopoietic cell . The hypothesis test research gene therapy vector , gene edit strategy , drug modality design achieve potentially therapeutic level globin gene expression mature erythroid cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients homozygous S/S disease doubly heterozygous S β thalassemia 2 year older eligible . Patients HbE β thalassemia homozygous ( severe ) βthalassemia also eligible . Patients thalassemia include transfusion dependent ( major ) severely anemic relatively transfusion independent ( intermedia ) . Diagnostic criterion include standard hematological parameter , red cell index , hemoglobin electrophoresis quantitative determination HbF HbA2 . Patients eligible participation protocol currently clinically stable free acute disease manifestation minimum 14 day . Patients may participate continue current therapeutic regimen include regular transfusion therapy hydroxyurea administration . In general , two category patient consider research participant protocol . 1 . Patients 18 year old therefore able provide inform consent eligible . Such individual recruit among patient follow SJCRH . In addition , individual follow outside clinic recruit ask come Hematology Clinic SJCRH enroll procedure perform . Alternatively , patient 18 old undergo diagnostic surgical procedure general anesthesia , agree participate study , bone marrow aspirate obtain time . 2 . Patients age 2 17 year schedule diagnostic surgical procedure SJCRH LeBonheur Children 's Medical Center sedation general anesthesia indicate eligible protocol enrollment . A bone marrow aspiration perform sedation general anesthesia diagnostic surgical procedure . Active , acute manifestation sickle cell disease include painful crisis , acute chest syndrome , cerebrovascular event active infection . Pregnant woman eligible study enrollment . Inability unwillingness research participant legal guardian/representative give write informed consent preclude enrollment research protocol .
