	<brief_summary>This study , sponsor NIAID University Bamako , Mali , identify genetic factor may protect severe malaria child . Children 6 month 17 year age live Kenieroba , Fourda Bozokin village Mali may enroll study . Participants blood sample collect finger prick small needle . The blood examine gene variant influence severity disease child expose malaria parasite . Children develop fever symptom malaria evaluate treated Kenieroba health center 5 year enter study , reach 18 year age . The child treat artesunate amodiaquine . Children severe disease treat quinine . One tablespoon blood drawn child study . At end dry season wet season , subset 200 healthy child ask provide 1 2 tablespoon blood , drawn needle place vein arm . Additional research blood sample may request child 2 17 year old . Blood take child twice year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemoglobin ( Hb ) red blood cell ( RBC ) polymorphisms give rise HbS , HbC , alpha-thalassemia , G6PD-deficiency , ABO blood group occur high frequency Mali . To determine whether Hb/RBC polymorphism associate protection mild malaria malaria-associated anemia , conduct cohort study Mali . Approximately 1300 child genotyped five Hb/RBC polymorphism follow 5 year compare mean incidence rate mild malaria , stratify polymorphism . Differences Hb level acute malaria episode baseline calculate determine Hb/RBC polymorphism influence degree malaria-associated anemia . To investigate whether Hb/RBC polymorphism impair monocyte activation , obtain parasite child malaria , culture RBCs different genotype , compare parasitized RBCs ability activate monocyte vitro . Plasma sample child malaria also compare level monocyte-derived cytokine . A variety single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) immune response gene recently identify African population . To determine whether polymorphism associate protection severe malaria , compare prevalence SNPs group child severe mild malaria . Blood Collection Study . Components innate immune system ( e.g. , Toll-like receptor ) express antigen presenting cell ( APC ) provide first line defense microbial infection frame nature scale adaptive immune response . To investigate whether APC malaria-experienced individual respond TLR ligands vitro stimulation assay , obtain blood sample 100 healthy child dry season wet season . Immunological memory key feature adaptive immunity involve memory T cell . Clinical trial malaria-nafve human volunteer vaccinate merozoite MSP-1 antigen enable u study development immunological memory measure memory T cell cytokine production expression surface activation marker . To investigate whether memory T cell malaria-experienced individual respond similarly AMA-I/MSP-1 ligands vitro stimulation assay , obtain blood sample additional 100 healthy child dry season wet season . These collection pair sample enable u explore possibility TLR- AMA-1/MSP-l-induced immune response boost transmission season increase age ( surrogate disease control immunity ) .</detailed_description>
