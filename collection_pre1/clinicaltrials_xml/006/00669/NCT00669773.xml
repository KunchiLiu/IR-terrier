Validate previously generate tumor gene expression proteomic profile independent sample determine predictive power distinguish good poor clinical pathological responder adriamycin docetaxel . 2 . Validate previously generate plasma proteomic profile independent sample determine predictive power distinguish good poor clinical pathological responder adriamycin docetaxel . Secondary objective 1 . To correlate adriamycin docetaxel pharmacokinetics 1 . Genetic polymorphism drug metabolize enzyme transporter , include MDR-1 , Cyp3A , GSTs , nuclear receptor . 2 . Drug toxicity tumor response . 3 . Peripheral mononuclear cell gene expression profile 2 . To study ondansetron pharmacokinetics correlate genetic polymorphism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validate Gene Expression Proteomic Signatures Predictive Treatment Response Breast Cancer Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many chemotherapeutic agent active breast cancer , although response rate individual drug 30-50 % . The choice chemotherapy empirical , development chemosensitivity assay desirable , reduce cost , unnecessary toxicity , loss window opportunity cure . Single molecular marker predict sensitivity highly accurate , chemotherapy resistance mechanism likely involve complex pathway . High-throughput technology gene expression microarray Proteinchip array allow simultaneous analysis thousand gene , hundred protein , may informative . We previously conduct study patient measurable primary breast tumor receive primary chemotherapy alternate regimen adriamycin docetaxel , generate tumor genomic tumor plasma proteomic signature predict clinical pathological response use high throughput discovery platform . This protocol aim recruit 20 patient independent test set validate genomic proteomic signature generate previously . Half patient randomize receive 4 cycle pre-operative adriamycin ( Arm A ) allow validation adriamycin-specific signature , half randomize receive 4 cycle pre-operative docetaxel ( Arm B ) allow validation docetaxel-specific signature . Subjects undergo resection primary breast tumor , follow 4 cycle adjuvant therapy alternative drug ( docetaxel Arm A , adriamycin Arm B ) . Serial tumor plasma sample obtain genomic proteomic analysis . The previously generate genomic proteomic signature apply independent dataset categorize patient good poor responder , prediction correlate actual treatment response . Secondary goal include correlation patient genotype drug pharmacokinetics , correlation chemotherapy-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression change treatment response toxicity</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients may include study meet follow criterion : Female , age 18 year . Histologic cytologic diagnosis breast carcinoma . T24 breast cancer measurable primary breast tumor , define palpable tumor diameter 2.0cm great measure caliper . Patients must receive prior chemotherapy hormonal therapy treatment breast cancer . Karnofsky performance status 70 high . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . Adequate organ function include follow : Bone marrow : Absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1.5 x 10 9/L Platelets &gt; = 100 x 10 9/L Hepatic : Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT AST &lt; = 2.5x ULN , ( &lt; = 5 X liver metastasis ) Renal : creatinine &lt; = 1.5x ULN Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; = 50 % Signed informed consent patient legal representative . Patients reproductive potential must use approved contraceptive method appropriate ( eg , intrauterine device , birth control pill , barrier device ) three month study . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior study enrollment . Patients exclude study follow reason : Prior treatment locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Treatment within last 30 day investigational drug . Concurrent administration tumor therapy , include cytotoxic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy . Active infection opinion investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Pregnancy . Breast feeding . Serious concomitant disorder would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability complete study , discretion investigator . Poorly control diabetes mellitus . Second primary malignancy clinically detectable time consideration study enrollment . Symptomatic brain metastasis . History significant neurological mental disorder , include seizure dementia . Peripheral neuropathy CTC grade 2 ( NCI CTC version 3 ) . History hypersensitivity drug formulate Tween 80 , vehicle use commercial docetaxel formulation .</criteria>
