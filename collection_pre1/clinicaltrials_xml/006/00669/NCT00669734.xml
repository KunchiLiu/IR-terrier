	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose vaccine therapy give together sargramostim treat patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer remove surgery . Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor , sargramostim , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Giving vaccine therapy directly tumor together sargramostim may cause strong immune response kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerability deliver two standard dos PANVAC-F ( fowlpox ) ( falimarev ) vaccine administer intratumorally conjunction subcutaneous injection PANVAC-V ( vaccinia ) ( inalimarev ) follow PANVAC-F ( fowlpox ) conjunction rH-GM-CSF ( sargramostim ) versus ( vs. ) subcutaneously inject PANVAC-V PANVAC-F conjunction rH-GM-CSF patient incurable pancreatic cancer base local unresectability small volume metastasis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity vaccine injection . II . To assess evidence tumor response image tumor marker response . III . To assess gene transfer pancreatic tissue . IV . To assess immunologic response PANVACTM . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study falimarev . Patients receive falimarev vaccine intratumorally use endoscopic ultrasound guidance day 1 . Patients also receive inalimarev vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 sargramostim SC day 1-4 . Patients receive falimarev vaccine SC day 15 29 sargramostim SC day 15-18 29-32 absence unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 43 , patient stable improve pancreatic cancer receive falimarev vaccine SC sargramostim SC ( give day 3 day falimarev vaccination ) monthly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 71 , patient irreversible dose limit toxicity , receive falimarev vaccine SC sargramostim SC ( give day 3 day falimarev vaccination ) monthly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo biopsy periodically correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
