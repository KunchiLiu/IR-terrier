	<brief_summary>No gold standard therapy exist clear mucus airways patient bronchiectasis . While rhDNase proven place treatment cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , fail improve Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) short-term non-CF bronchiectasis study show detrimental 6 month therapy non CF bronchiectasis , moreover proven effect mucociliary clearance . Hypertonic saline show comparable mode action inhale mannitol , yet examine long term treatment option bronchiectasis . The purpose study examine efficacy safety 52 week treatment inhale mannitol subject non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis . Previous study inhale mannitol demonstrate improvement mucociliary clearance ; mucus rehydration ; improvement quality life respiratory symptom patient bronchiectasis pulmonary function cystic fibrosis . The result current study combination recently complete 3 month study seek confirm early finding extend evidence support use mucoactive therapy subject bronchiectasis . We hypothesize mannitol improve overall health hygiene lung regular effective clearing mucus load . As consequence reduction mucus load inflammatory process , frequency bronchiectasis relate pulmonary exacerbation need exacerbation relate antibiotic treatment fall . Days hospital community health care cost expect change line improvement respiratory health . Finally , plan demonstrate inhaled mannitol safe well tolerate 52 week period . We test hypothesis use 400 mg mannitol twice daily ( BD ) control .</brief_summary>
