	<detailed_description>This study evaluate effectiveness refractive correction alone treatment previously untreated strabismic combined-mechanism amblyopia child 3 &lt; 7 year old visual acuity 20/40 20/400 . A recently complete PEDIG study ( ATS5 ) find 3 &lt; 7-year-old child previously untreated anisometropic amblyopia , refractive correction alone improve visual acuity 2 line 77 % patient amblyopia resolve least one third patient . These result support previous observation retrospective pilot study well Stewart et al 's prospective report 18 child anisometropic amblyopia whose visual acuity improve treatment spectacle correction . Improvement amblyopic eye visual acuity treatment optimum refractive correction case anisometropic amblyopia plausible refractive correction treat underlie amblyogenic condition ( i.e. , uncorrected unequal refractive error ) provide retinal image similar clarity , size , contrast . Elimination dissimilar retinal image , may act barrier normal visual input , allow amblyopic eye receive appropriate visual stimulation . In contrast , visual acuity improvement refractive correction alone case amblyopia associate strabismus expect occur refractive correction completely eliminate strabismus restore fusion . In case , underlie amblyogenic factor manifest ocular deviation remain ; consequently , active cortical inhibition presumably still present . Nonetheless , Stewart colleague recently report finding gain amblyopic eye visual acuity child strabismic combined-mechanism amblyopia period treatment refractive correction alone . The PEDIG also observe occur subgroup child previously untreated strabismic combined-mechanism amblyopia recent study . Amblyopic eye acuity improve &gt; = 2 line spectacle-corrected baseline acuity 9 ( 75 % ; 95 % CI = 43 % - 95 % ) 12 patient strabismic amblyopia 9 ( 69 % , 95 % CI = 39 % - 91 % ) 13 patient combined-mechanism amblyopia . Mean change baseline maximum improvement 2.2 +- 1.8 2.6 +- 2.0 line , respectively . These result similar Stewart colleague report visual acuity improvement average 3.0 line 16 child strabismic amblyopia 1.9 line 31 child combined-mechanism amblyopia . Although result support suggestion Stewart et al . strabismic amblyopia improve spectacle correction alone , conclusive study small number patient . Also , classification strabismus base alignment without refractive correction . Thus , large control study need confirm refute finding patient strabismic combined-mechanism amblyopia . The ideal study design answer question whether spectacle alone significantly improve amblyopic eye visual acuity strabismic child randomize trial control group receive optical correction . However , pediatric eye care provider would reluctant randomize esotropic child hyperopic refractive error control group optical correction likelihood child accommodative esotropia , would necessitate hyperopic spectacle prescribe . The number esotropic amblyopes without accommodative component sufficiently make randomized trial feasible . Therefore , choose perform observational study large number child pure strabismic combined-mechanism amblyopia order evaluate effect refractive correction population patient .</detailed_description>
