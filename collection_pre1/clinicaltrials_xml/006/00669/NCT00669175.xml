	<brief_summary>When narcotic pain medicine , like fentanyl morphine , give adult child several day , often develop tolerance medicine . This mean may need high dos time get amount pain control . When time stop medicine , dose decreased slowly patient withdrawal symptom . Naloxone medicine high dos reverse effect narcotic . At small dos may help prevent tolerance lessen severity withdrawal symptom . This could mean less narcotic pain medicine need few day . The purpose research study see give naloxone neonate require narcotic infusion safe effective . Safety measure incidence side effect . Efficacy measure monitoring change pain sedation score need pain medicine .</brief_summary>
