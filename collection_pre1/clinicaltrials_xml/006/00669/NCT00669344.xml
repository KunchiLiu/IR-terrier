	<detailed_description>Methodology : This 24-week , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled pilot study 9 mg / day Rivastigmine patient Cognitive Impairment Not Dementia due cerebrovascular disease . During screen period , patient evaluate CIND mean neuropsychological test establish cognitive impairment follow stroke result subcortical ischemic vascular disease ( diagnosed MRI ) AND exclusion dementia DSM-IV criterion . At baseline , eligible patient evaluate additional inclusion/exclusion criterion , vital sign , MMSE , Ten Point Clock Test , Colour Trails Test 1 &amp; 2 , ADAS-Cog , Cognitive Battery , Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB ) , Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study Activities Daily Living ( ADCS-ADL ) scale mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) , Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) past/coexistent medical condition . Laboratory examination ECGs evaluate screen week 24 . Patients evaluate every 4 week 12 week time dose increase make vital sign evaluate . At Week 12 , cognitive functional measure evaluate include Ten Point Clock Test , Colour Trails Test 1 &amp; 2 , ADAS-Cog , Cognitive Battery , FAB , ADL Scale MCI , NPI GDS evaluate . At week 16 week 20 , telephone call make patient caregiver ascertain compliance . At Week 24 , cognitive functional measure evaluate include Ten Point Clock Test , Colour Trails Test 1 &amp; 2 , ADAS-Cog , Cognitive Battery , FAB , ADL Scale MCI , NPI GDS evaluate . Patients receive bottle trial drug appropriate titration dose every 4 week titration phase start rivastigmine/placebo 1.5mg bd daily . During maintenance phase / week 12 , patient give 3 bottle trial drug appropriate maintenance dose . Adverse event serious adverse event capture every visit . In addition , patient discontinue study follow safety evaluation 24 week .</detailed_description>
