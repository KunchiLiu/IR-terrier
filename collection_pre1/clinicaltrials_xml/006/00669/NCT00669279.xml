	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether atenolol control release carvedilol lower blood pressure body effectively arm . Blood pressure measure aorta , large blood vessel carry blood away heart , may better measure harmful effect high blood pressure body 's organ . In past , blood pressure measure arm . However , blood pressure arm may accurately reflect blood pressure aorta thus may mislead doctor treat high blood pressure . For reason , test whether two different medication blood pressure , class call beta blocker , similar effect blood pressure arm aorta .</brief_summary>
