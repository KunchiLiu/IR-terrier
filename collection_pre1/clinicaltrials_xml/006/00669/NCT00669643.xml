	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize trial verify leprosy patient , despite classification , treat regimen without compromise patient cure acceptability treatment . At present , patient classify multibacillary leprosy treat 12 month three drug , patient classify paucibacillary leprosy treat 6 month two drug . The study go test unify regimen paucibacillary multibacillary patient treat leprosy patient three drug 6 dos .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uniform Multidrug Therapy Regimen Leprosy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past treatment new leprosy patient classification criterion treatment purpose go major change . At moment , newly diagnose leprosy patient classify PB MB base number lesion . More 5 lesion lead classification MB patient treatment 12 month MDT compose three drug , i.e . rifampicin , dapsone clofazimine . One 5 lesion lead classification PB patient treatment 6 month MDT compose two drug , i.e . rifampicin dapsone . Despite favorable data point view practical application , therapeutic regimen still present constraint , include lengthy course treatment . Especially situation leprosy control integrate general health service classification problem general health worker receive one two day train leprosy . A uniform regimen leprosy would simplify treatment field . Results control program research project demonstrate relapse rate MDT extremely low , approximately 0.2 % annually among MB case 24-dose regimen . The low relapse rate indicate room shorten course MDT le 24 monthly-supervised dos rifampicin plus self-administered dos dapsone clofazimine . Although paper suggest relapse rate MDT may significantly high MB patient initial bacterial index equal big 3 , present diagnostic universe leprosy include patient , total number relapse cause would account minimal percentage case control program . Since 1998 , 12-month treatment course MB leprosy advise WHO . The main problem evaluate new treatment regimen leprosy , good reliable data available current treatment regimen : relapse rate never systematically determined hold true reaction nerve function impairment rate , major cause nerve damage lead handicaps deformity leprosy patient . Currently , WHO explore possibility introduce short uniform treatment regimen type leprosy patient call Uniform Multidrug Therapy ( U-MDT ) , replacement present regular multidrug therapy ( R-MDT ) . This U-MDT would consist treatment patient 6 month regimen consist three drug : rifampicin , dapsone clofazimine . The efficacy U-MDT currently study open non-controlled treatment trial . Classification patient do clinical criterion : skin smear lab test include . The diagnosis relapse rely clinical diagnosis . It therefore possible identify high-risk group relapse , highly skin smear positive patient . The objective study evaluate R-MDT U-MDT regimen randomise trial order : 1. determine efficacy current R-MDT regimen regard relapse rate acceptability patient . 2. determine efficacy U-MDT regimen regard relapse rate acceptability patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All newly diagnose leprosy case characteristic skin lesion , without systemic symptom confirm histopathological study previously untreated PB MB leprosy patient . Never treat patient treat five year ago Safety concern : History intolerance one medication Lack suitability trial : Absence leprosy skin lesion Pure neural leprosy ( PNL ) Patient previously ( defaulter relapse ) treat leprosy less 5 year ago Association serious disease HIV/AIDS , Tuberculosis , Malaria , American Cutaneous leishmaniasis , Visceral Leishmaniasis , Lymphoma , Leukaemia , Immunosuppression , etc . Administrative reason Patients permanent resident area unable come clinic every month treatment first half year ( intensive followup period ) treatment . Patients give informed consent capable give inform consent due mental impairment . Patients overt sign AIDS unlikely follow whole study period . As test patient HIV positivity , HIVinfected leprosy patient include study .</criteria>
