	<criteria>Eligible patient must locoregionally treat HCC prior AFP serum determination limit normality laboratory . This study enroll adult age 18 . Have HCC history serum AFP determination upper limit normality laboratory . Both male female patient may enrol . Premenopausal females undergone surgical sterilization procedure must negative pregnancy test prior treatment . Sexually active female childbearing potential require use two form contraception , include barrier method , trial eligibility . Sexually active male use appropriate `` double barrier '' method birth control ( female use diaphragm , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , contraceptive sponge , addition male use condom . Be HLAA2.1 positive ( HLAA*0201 ) DNA subtyping , HLAA2 positive flow cytometry antibody MA2.1 BB7.2 . Stage II IVa HCC locoregional therapy ( surgical resection , radiofrequency ablation , cryoablation , ethanol injection , chemoembolization radioembolization ) . Karnofsky Performance Status great equal 70 percent . No evidence opportunistic infection year enrollment . Adequate baseline hematological function assess follow laboratory value within 30 day prior study entry ( day 30 0 ) : Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL ( patient transfusion dependent ) Platelets &gt; 50,000/mm3 Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,000/mm3 Conserved liver function ChildPugh Class A B . Ability give inform consent . Patients meet one follow criterion exclude study entry : Any congenital acquire condition lead inability generate immune response , include concomitant immune suppressive therapy . The ability adequately respond recall skin test antigen test trial entry negative response skin allergens reason exclusion . Concomitant steroid therapy chemotherapy , treatment &lt; 30 day first vaccination . Females childbearing potential ( premenopausal surgically sterilize ) must negative serum HCG pregnancy test ( within Day 14 Day 0 ) . Acute infection : acute viral , bacterial , fungal infection , require specific therapy exclude HBV HCV . Acute therapy must complete within 14 day prior study treatment . HIVinfected patient ( ability generate cellular immune response alter due CD4dependent immunosuppressive effect HIV infection ) . Patients underlying condition would contraindicate therapy study treatment ( allergies reagent use study ) . Patients organ allograft ( require prolong immunosuppressive therapy ) . Patients high serum titer neutralize antiadenoviral antibody ( positive great 1:128 dilution serum AdV block assay , expect approximately 30 % patient , greatly reduce ability respond AdV boost ) .</criteria>
