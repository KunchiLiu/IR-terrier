	<brief_title>A Study Biweekly Gemcitabine , Paclitaxel , Avastin Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether new chemotherapy schedule use biweekly combination paclitaxel ( Taxol® ) , gemcitabine ( Gemzar® ) Avastin would help lessen in-between-cycle growth resistant cell evaluate toxicity therapy . Taxol approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use metastatic breast metastatic ovarian cancer use study investigational . Gemzar FDA approve use breast , lung pancreatic cancer use study investigational . The Avastin give study commercially available , however , approve FDA use metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>
