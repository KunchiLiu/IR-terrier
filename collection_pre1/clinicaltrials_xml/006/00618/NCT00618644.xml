	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Neovascularization Sickle Cell Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In U.S. , 10 % African Americans abnormal hemoglobin gene . About 8 % African Americans heterozygous Hemoglobin S. In United States , sickle cell anemia primarily occur black population , approximately 0.2 % African American child afflict disease . It may associate hemoglobinopathy well . The prevalence adult low decrease life expectancy . Systemically , sickle cell anemia variation ( SS ) produce symptom . With respect eye , sickle cell disease mutation ( SC ) produce effect . Overall , sickle cell trait expression ( AS ) produce few complication . - Among patient SC SThal , incidence proliferation sickle cell retinopathy 33 % 14 % respectively . - Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy major cause vision loss sickle cell disease . For sickle cell retinopathy , commonly use therapeutic modality include laser retinal photocoagulation , retinal cryotherapy , vitrectomy/membranectomy depend severity disease . The effective therapeutic modality minimal postoperative complication appear scatter laser retinal photocoagulation . A single case study bevacizumab find effective short term regression neovascularization improve vision single injection . Further study ranibizumab warrant . Recent clinical trial ( Marina Anchor ) demonstrate ranibizumab effective treating patient CNV age-related macular degeneration . Retinopathy sickle cell disease also link VEGF . Therefore , patient sickle cell retinopathy respond ranibizumab therapy . This open-label single dose , phase I study intravitreally administer ranibizumab patient sickle cell retinopathy . Consented , enrolled subject receive single open-label intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab . Three subject one site United States enrol . Patients receive one dose 0.5 mg ranibizumab administer intravitreally .</detailed_description>
