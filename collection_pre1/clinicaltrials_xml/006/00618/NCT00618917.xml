	<detailed_description>This Phase I-II study evaluate feasibility , safety , efficacy swallow MnSOD plasmid/liposome ( PL ) transgene give protection radiation-induced esophagitis concurrent paclitaxel carboplatin chemotherapy thoracic radiation subject locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Phase I study assess feasibility safety MnSOD PL dose escalation 3 cohort 3 chemoradiotherapy subject ( Cohort1 = 0.3 mg/dose , Cohort2 = 3 mg/dose , Cohort3 = 30 mg/dose ) . The high dose complete ( determined toxicity monitor 8 week initial treatment ) start dose Phase II . Phase II examine efficacy MnSOD PL assess incidence Grade 3 4 esophagitis 27 additional chemoradiotherapy subject . Incidence esophageal toxicity , well clinical response combination chemoradiotherapy MnSOD PL outcomes interest .</detailed_description>
