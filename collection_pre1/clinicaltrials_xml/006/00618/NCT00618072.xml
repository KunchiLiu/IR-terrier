The study evaluate effect unique carbohydrate modify diet alone combination metformin ( MF ) Avandamet® ( MF plus rosiglitazone ( RSG ) ) insulin level wide range ethnically diverse woman ( age 35-55 ) three academic medical center . The primary study hypothesis insulin sensitize medication , combination alteration carbohydrate intake , reduce insulin level improve establish risk factor metabolic syndrome . The alarm prevalence obesity , diabetes , related comorbidities paucity easily adopt , cost-effective preventive strategy high risk population , suggest pharmaco-therapies dietary regimen target reduce insulin resistance could important clinical public health implication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Progressive weight gain start fourth fifth decade commonly report woman ethnic socio-economic group . Our previous data suggest , large diverse subpopulation healthy-appearing woman midlife weight gain may represent early clinical manifestation insulin resistance - demarcate increased insulin response curve presence completely normal glucose tolerance test . We term disorder Syndrome W highlight define triad weight gain , waist gain white-coat hypertension woman role alphabetic chronologic antecedent well know Syndrome X . As disorder insulin action young woman , include Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome ( PCOS ) , early adrenarche , precocious puberty , Syndrome W , presumably , harbinger The Metabolic Syndrome Type 2 diabetes early optimal period intervention . Preliminary data first pilot study suggest metformin , combination hypocaloric , low-fat , carbohydrate modify dietary program produce significant sustainable weight loss woman Syndrome W , notable reduction fast insulin level . These finding support hypothesis insulin elevation might antecedent , well consequence , weight gain , account progressive intractable weight spiral woman transition forty sixty . Additional two four year follow-up intention-to-treat analysis consecutive woman lose ≥10 % body weight one year treatment regimen suggest composite intervention prevents weight regain onset overt glucose impairment . The protocol evolve evaluation treatment several hundred patient see The Endocrine Faculty Practice ten year period highly successful broad ethnic range normo-glycemic , hyperinsulinemic subject . These include midlife woman weight gain overweight men upper body obesity - population comparably treat prior study focus predominantly subject discernible glycemic abnormality . The magnitude duration treatment effect suggest rigorous study undertaken randomize clinical trial . PPAR agonists include thiazolidinediones ( TZD 's ) new category insulin sensitizer increasingly wide well-studied positive attribute , include redistribution fat depot , increase adiponectin secretion , reduction inflammatory proinflammatory marker . The combination metformin rosiglitazone ( Avandamet® ) FDA-approved treatment hyperglycemia patient Type 2 diabetes . Previous clinical research recent laboratory data suggest two category insulin sensitizer independent additive mechanism action could target , ultimately , modulate underlying pathogenesis insulin resistance . Comparison study suggest TZD 's may great insulin sensitize action provide great reduction hyperinsulinemia metformin . However , due increase adipocyte expression ( possible mechanism ) , weight gain common undesirable side effect TZD treatment . The addition metformin rosiglitazone , along dietary strategy reduce endogenous insulin production could prove ideal therapeutic option attenuate insulin resistance preserve ß-cell function high risk individual . Early initiation dual regimen normoglycemic subject document hyperinsulinemia could profound implication Syndrome W woman additional 25 % adult US population estimate manifestation The Metabolic Syndrome . The primary study question address whether dual treatment regimen modulate insulin action reduce hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance high risk , healthy-appearing normoglycemic , hyperinsulinemic subject identify progressive , intractable , midlife weight gain</detailed_description>
