	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study see pulmonary rehabilitation improve patient ' lung function , would increase chance become eligible surgery . The health pulmonary rehabilitation participant surgery also examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Pulmonary Rehabilitation Surgical Outcomes Cancer Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary rehabilitation process design improve patient ' lung function , muscular conditioning , exercise performance , overall quality life . Study activity include exercise training , patient family education , psychosocial behavioral counseling provide healthcare team . Rehabilitation plan vary patient patient base result follow test : - Blood ( 1-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . - You X-ray chest . - You Pulmonary Function Test . For test , ask breathe several different way mouthpiece mouth test lung function . Study Visits : If choose take part study , 3-4 week pulmonary rehabilitation . During 3-4 week period , 9-12 study visit last 90 minute . The following test procedure perform : 6-Minute Walk Test : To perform 6-minute walk test , walk far possible around cone flat indoor course 40 yard long . You walk pace take breaks time . After 6 minute , study staff check total distance walk . Your vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) measure walk . Your oxygen saturation level monitor throughout test . You wear small clip finger send oxygen saturation data small computer . Oxygen Consumption Test : An oxygen consumption study help doctor determine well heart lung work exercise . You ask pedal bicycle move , wear mouthpiece measure amount oxygen take . Wires place chest monitor heart activity , blood pressure cuff place arm monitor blood pressure . The amount exercise measure increase resistance pedal . You continue pedal become short breath tire keep go . You may stop exercise time become uncomfortable experience dizziness , chest pain , and/or shortness breath . During oxygen consumption test , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) may draw measure amount oxygen blood . If live outside Houston area , refer pulmonary rehabilitation program local area . Any record outside pulmonary rehabilitation facility give study staff study complete . You follow-up visit ( describe ) M. D. Anderson . Follow-up Visits : Your health status check 1 3 month last study visit surgery , 1 3 month surgery . At follow-up visit , follow test procedure perform : - You 6-minute walk test , Pulmonary Function Test , Oxygen Consumption Test . - You ask fill quality-of-life questionnaire take 30 minute complete . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - An echocardiogram do patient-by patient basis . An echocardiogram us sound wave make picture heart , help show well heart pump blood . You ask lie left side technician place probe gel chest create image heart determine function size . Long-term Follow-up : The research staff may contact phone regard health status . Patients lung surgery may contact phone medical record review course 30 day surgery hospitalization surgery ( hospitalization may last 30 day ) . This investigational study . Using pulmonary rehabilitation try improve patient ' lung function consider experimental . At time , do research . Up 75 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Previously report severe pulmonary hypertension ( pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt; 60 determined echocardiogram ) , refractory cor pulmonale ( manifest right ventricular dilatation dysfunction echocardiogram ) 2 . Previously report exerciseinduced syncope , angina , palpitation , arrhythmia , hypotension ( drop 20 % systolic/dystolic baseline ) 3 . History severe congestive heart failure ( NYHA class 3 4 ) refractory medical management , ( LVEF &lt; 40 % echocardiogram ) . 4 . Bone metastasis 5 . Active psychiatric illness could interfere treatment .</criteria>
