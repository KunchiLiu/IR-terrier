	<brief_summary>Trachoma disease poverty , hyperendemic area affect individual time two year old . Active disease concentrate child occur sporadically adult . Infection widespread . It anticipate 25 % child blind disease live 60 year age . The blindness rate higher woman , presumably closer contact child infect add damage infection woman young . This proposal well define azithromycin community-based treatment use eliminate blinding trachoma . We also take opportunity join field study genetic epidemiologic study well understand dynamic epidemiology Chlamydia trachomatis infection trachoma endemic area . The empiric data generate treatment/follow-up study , together information source spread pattern genetic epidemiology use generate robust model guide future treatment/re-treatment protocol . We propose conduct randomize , community base trial Maradi region Niger test hypothesis two community wide azithromycin treatment , space one month apart , significantly effective reduce ocular C. trachomatis infection trachoma one year compare single mass azithromycin treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Population We take advantage ongoing work ten village currently study Kornaka West . They never mass treatment azithromycin , baseline trachoma infection rate great 20 % . The final survey current study occur January , 2008 . Within village , use update complete village census list generate January 2008 survey . The child survey randomly select baseline census provide sample approximately 50-60 child village age 0 five year . They cohort child age 2 7 year . We propose add approximately 15 child age 0-2 updated census list total 65-70 child per village . Sample We propose re-randomize village , stratify baseline trachoma rate former intervention , treatment intervention ( 2 round mass treatment ) control ( one round mass treatment ) arm . The village balance baseline trachoma rate original randomization water sanitation intervention . Within village , propose use sample child age 2-7 year add random sample 15 child age 0 2 year . It also important determine effect two mass drug administration arm infection adult , propose randomly select one adult household index child . If adult village time survey , next randomly assign adult select study . Statistical plan include sample size justification interim data analysis We intend analyze data start determine comparability sample child adult intervention control village . Village characteristic , household characteristic , age gender distribution compare intervention control status . Importantly , baseline assessment trachoma , C. trachomatis infection , use assure comparability . Variables differ use potentially confounding factor . We determine change baseline one month one year trachoma prevalence prevalence C. trachomatis sentinel sample , stratify child adult . We compare average prevalence intervention village compare control village , way preserve unit randomization . We use logistic regression model predict trachoma/infection time point , adjust cluster within village confound factor . Coverage mass treatment also include predictor trachoma/infection . We use sample child estimate power , risk group high rate infection trachoma . With sample size 350 child per group , 80 % power ( Î±=0.5 ) detect 15 % difference decline active trachoma infection , assume modest village level cluster . We sample 140 subject per village ( 70 child plus one randomly select adult household ) total 1400 subject . Subjects sample baseline , one-month post-treatment , one-year post-treatment . Prior survey , train program take place accomplish follow objective survey team : - All person grade trachoma standardize senior grader , reliability kappa=0.65 TF TI , least . Consistency across grader essential difference attributable grader variation . In case , grader must work village , effect variation grader confound effect variation village . - All person take assist laboratory specimen train proper technique take store specimens field . - Proper completion survey form , `` Examen Oculaire '' child adult sample , completion census list treatment receipt person village The Baseline survey trachoma sample child adult take place prior antibiotic intervention . The survey consist follow step : 1 . Prior survey village , member team alert village leadership survey team come , mass treatment member community , part Niger Trachoma Control Program part survey . 2 . The day baseline survey , member household ask stay concession examination mass treatment , do house house . As come , name check list sample survey , need treatment . If person house part trachoma survey , form prepare single specimen label fill examiner laboratory technician . The label consist type visit ( b=baseline , 1=one month , 2=one year ) full study identification number sample person : ( village number ) - ( concession number ) - ( person number ) . Thus , baseline survey , person life village number 2 , concession number A-034 census list person 16 would study identification number 02-A-034-16 , label vial B-02-A-034-16 3 . The trachoma grader evert eyelid . Therefore , finger primary source contamination laboratory specimen . He change glove exam ( wash glove soap water ) child , even child house even child appear trachoma . This 20 % child without trachoma still infection C. trachomatis ( sub-clinical infection ) . The trachoma grader , wear 2.5X loupe use torche ( sunlight ) , assess trachoma status tarsal plate , use WHO Simplified grade scheme . The assistant first evert right eyelid , grade tarsal plate , evert leave eyelid grade trachoma status tarsal plate . A scribe record trachoma assessment `` Examen Oculaire '' form . 4 . While leave eyelid still evert , laboratory technician , follow careful procedure describe train manual , roll swab three time across tarsal plate obtain specimen . The swab must touch anything tarsal plate . The lab technician also touch anything swab vial . Once swab take , inserted open NUC vial , break , NUC vial close . The sealed vial label pre-printed label place cold box ice pack field . The scribe record specimen take , reason take . 5 . At point , sample person eligible azithromycin , administer 20mg/kg . A height stick use estimate dose . For child young 2 month , topical tetracycline use 4-6 week . The form review completeness , store safely eventual data entry . Please note : The first azithromycin treatment study arm administer part Niger 's trachoma control program ; second azithromycin treatment provide Arm 2 part experimental protocol 6 . The concession check see member sample examined swab obtain . If , remainder concession treat azithromycin accordance program guideline . 7 . The second treatment team assign village provide azithromycin treatment household NOT anyone sample , order expedite treatment entire village . 8 . At end day field , specimen transfer freezer World Vision Maradi , await return freezer Niamey . During drive Niamey , specimens must keep frozen well , ice pack . 9 . The data entry clerk enter survey form `` baseline '' database survey baseline survey , `` one month '' `` one year '' database , depend follow-up survey . The data entry clerk also enter data receive treatment baseline , two month treatment data base . The sample child adult survey trachoma infection one month post last treatment , one year . No additional person add sample replace died move away , baseline data replacement . The procedure one month one year follow survey exactly baseline survey , except follow : laboratory label change `` B '' `` 1 '' `` 2 '' first part label , survey form enter one month one year data base . All positive specimen major outer membrane gene amplify sequence . The genovars map location within village family distribution follow time , treatment provide well understanding epidemiology infection . Results study use data input generation mathematical model predict whether community-wide retreatment ( alternate strategy ) need , optimal timing retreatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects live village Niger exhibit high prevalence clinically active trachoma ( &gt; 15 % ) amongst child live village . This prevalence clinical disease marker much high infection rate , thus justify community wide treatment . To eligible participate study subject must live one village select study . All subject meet exclusion criterion exclude study participation . Exclusion criterion include : history allergy ANY macrolide antibiotic severe nausea diarrhea first dose azithromycin inability tolerate oral therapy preexist serious illness</criteria>
