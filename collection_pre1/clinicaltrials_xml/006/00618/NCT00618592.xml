	<brief_summary>The recent development oral carbohydrate drink consumption prior elective surgical procedure show improve insulin sensitivity . However , study investigate use carbohydrate supplement patient undergoing cardiac spinal surgery . Hypothesis : The administration 100g carbohydrate even 50g carbohydrate two hour elective coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) spinal surgery reduce postoperative insulin resistance 40 % compare undergoing standard care fast even day surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Pre-operative Carbohydrate Loading Reduce Insulin Resistance Improve Outcomes Elective Surgical Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many Western hospital , include St. Michael 's Hospital , fast 12-14 hour standard protocol patient enter elective surgery . Fasting result depletion energy store consequently , patient enters surgery catabolic state . Furthermore , human body react surgery produce variety stress hormone hormone-like protein enable body react stress injury appropriately . One change occur surgery related body store metabolize glucose . During surgery , muscle adipose tissue become less sensitive action insulin ( insulin resistant ) . Insulin resistance result reduce uptake glucose tissue subsequently rise circulate blood glucose level . Sustained high level blood glucose associate post-surgical complication less favourable outcome . Previous study find fast surgery exacerbate insulin resistance surgery . The recent development carbohydrate drink consumption prior elective surgical procedure show well tolerate pose additional risk pulmonary aspiration ingest two hour prior surgery . Furthermore , appear metabolic , psychological possibly clinical benefit pre-operative carbohydrate loading compare fasting , include improvement insulin resistance . However , study do date limit small sample size , lack clinical outcome data reliance upon predominantly surgery shorter duration reduce metabolic stress insulin resistance lower . Therefore , need investigate effect carbohydrate load insulin resistance clinical outcome patient undergo surgery extend duration complexity . Patients undergo major cardiac spinal surgery ideal study effect pre-operative carbohydrate loading since type operation long duration relatively high surgical stress result development significant insulin resistance , thus potentially benefit pre-operative carbohydrate loading . Therefore , conduct large randomize trial investigate effect pre-operative carbohydrate load comparison fast insulin resistance clinical outcome patient undergo invasive cardiac spinal surgery St. Michael 's Hospital . We hypothesize consumption pre-operative carbohydrate load reduce postoperative insulin resistance 40 % ( measure standardize short insulin tolerance test ) . As secondary outcome , hypothesize pre-operative carbohydrate loading reduce circulate marker inflammation stress well improve clinical outcome blood product utilization , incidence hyperglycemia , rate adverse event length stay comparison standard pre-operative fasting . This study provide important information regard clinical benefit associate consumption pre-operative carbohydrate load . Many European centre already liberalize pre-operative treatment ; study help optimize perioperative management outcomes surgical patient institution .</detailed_description>
