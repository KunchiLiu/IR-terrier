	<brief_summary>The medicine use treat HIV suppress kill virus body . A small amount virus remain low level part blood call plasma . It crucial importance identify source residual virus patient receive antiretroviral therapy . The purpose study investigate whether source low level plasma virus latent ( old ) infection ongoing ( new ) infection . MK-0518 investigational drug , mean yet FDA approve , work different way anti-HIV medicine help kill virus . We hypothesize addition MK-0518 stable anti-HIV regimen reduce viral load patient undetectable plasma virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Adding Raltegravir ( MK-0518 ) Antiretroviral Therapy Patients With Low Level Viremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , non-comparative , single center trial antiretroviral therapy intensification use investigational integrase inhibitor MK-0518 investigational viral load assay measure response additional antiviral therapy . Eighteen patient receive open-label MK-0518 400 mg P.O . every 12 hour 28 day addition prescribe antiretroviral therapy . Patients take dos MK-0518 without regard food . The study enroll patient antiretroviral therapy regimens Cluster Differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) count great 200 cells/ul , HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 50 copy RNA/ml plasma use commercial assay ( conventional Amplicor ) detectable plasma virus ( viral load ≥ 1 copy RNA/ml plasma , Single copy assay , `` SCA '' ) . Acceptable antiretroviral regimen include Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( `` NRTIs '' ) + protease inhibitor ( PI ) I , NRTIs + non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , + PI , NRTIs + NNRTI-containing regimen . Patients prior evidence resistance antiretroviral drug . Patients screened intensification history , physical exam , laboratory evaluation ( see ) . Patients eligible agree participate intensify antiretroviral therapy 28 day MK-0518 400 mg mouth twice day . During 28- day drug addition , patient sample draw SCA assay entry day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 ( +/- 1 ) , last day intensification day 28 . Patients additional phlebotomy intensification day 29 , 30 , 35 , 42 , 49 58 ( +/- 1 day ) . The intensification period follow post- intensification period determine whether removal drug result viral RNA change .</detailed_description>
