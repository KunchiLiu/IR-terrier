	<brief_title>Intranasal CO2 Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : We perform randomize , two-way crossover study subject seasonal allergic rhinitis season . Subjects come Nasal Physiology Laboratory screening , complete allergy questionnaire underwent skin-prick test confirmation grass ragweed allergy . The skin test include positive negative control result grade compare control 1+ 4+ ( 1+ : wheal large negative control small positive control ; 2+ : wheal 5-7 mm ; 3+ : wheal 7-10 mm ; 4+ : reaction wheal &gt; 10 mm pronounce pseudopodium ) . Subjects positive skin test ( 2+ 4+ ) positive history allergic symptom relevant season underwent screen nasal challenge either grass ragweed allergen . Subjects pass screen challenge ( twofold increase either ipsilateral contralateral nasal secretion allergen challenge compare diluent ) 2-week washout period return laboratory , randomize receive intranasal treatment either CO2 treatment . Thirty minute treatment , subject underwent nasal challenge allergen . Seven subject challenge ragweed five subject challenge grass . Subjects another 2-weeks washout period cross treatment follow similar challenge . Previous work laboratory use similar challenge system show allergen-induced inflammatory change back baseline 2 week challenge . Subjects : Twelve subject participate . Subjects study outside allergy season . All subject healthy except mild asthma require as-needed bronchodilator . They medications receive antihistamine leukotriene receptor antagonist least 1 week intranasal steroid least 1 month enrollment duration study . Treatment : CO2 apply 10 second nostril use special applicator ( plastic tight-seal nosepiece ) attach CO2 canister flow control valve . It deliver flow rate 0.5 standard L/min mouth open prevent inhalation . Thus , 20-second duration administration , total dose CO2 deliver 167 mL . The amount CO2 deliver mucosa unknown . The no-treatment arm involve placement device gas deliver . Therefore , neither subject investigator blind treatment administer . The no-treatment arm involve delivery air without CO2 nose concern blow dry air nose might cause mucosal reaction could confound result . We previously show cold , dry air challenge create hyperosmolar environment , trigger mast cell activation , induces nasonasal reaction.7 Thus , primary outcome objective measure nasonasal reflex , avoid possibility . Nasal Challenge : The subject allow 15 minute acclimatize laboratory environment challenge . Baseline sneeze reflect 15 minute acclimatization nasal eye symptom record follow collection nasal scrap quantitation eosinophil nasal secretion . Sneezes record subject assess interval challenge protocol . The subject remind keep track number sneeze research coordinator present duration challenge . Intranasal CO2 sham applied 10 second nostril . Thirty minute later , sneeze symptom record , reflect 30-minute time period , nasal challenge initiate . Because interested evaluate effect treatment allergen-induced nasal reflex , use filter paper disk perform challenge monitor secretory response previously describe . Briefly , 8-mm filter paper disk ( Shandon , Inc. , Pittsburgh , PA ) use nasal challenge collection resultant secretion . They place anterior nasal septum , beyond mucocutaneous junction , direct vision use nasal speculum , forceps , headlight . Fifty microliters challenge solution place disk , apply nasal septum 1 minute . Thirty second removal , two preweighed filter paper disk place side nasal septum 30 second , collect nasal secretion challenge site ( ipsilateral ) contralateral nostril . These disk immediately place back microtubes weigh . The difference weight challenge weight produce nasal secretion , record milligram . Ten minute challenge , number sneeze well symptom side record subject reflective 10-minute interval The first challenge perform use phenol-buffered saline , diluent allergen extract , follow 2 increase dos grass ragweed allergen . The time treatment administration first allergen challenge approximately 40 minute second allergen challenge , 50 minute . The amount allergen apply paper disk challenge 333 1000 BAU ( bioequivalent allergy unit ) grass allergen extract ( Hollister-Stier , Spokane , WA ) 50 microliters ragweed antigen extract concentration 1:666 1:200 w/v ( Hollister-Stier ) . The subject come back laboratory 24 hour later underwent scrap nasal secretion evaluate eosinophil influx .</detailed_description>
