	<brief_summary>Background : - Tobacco smoke one preventable cause morbidity mortality world , addictive property nicotine few 10 percent people attempt quit smoking remain tobacco-free 1 year . Researchers study addictive property nicotine attempt develop successful medication therapy smoke cessation . - Nicotine act chemical receptor brain , include opioid receptor affect perception pain . Repeated nicotine administration cause adaptation brain opioid receptor , heightens addictive property nicotine increase likelihood severity withdrawal symptom associate smoke cessation . Researchers interested use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan study brain chemical response nicotine current smoker nonsmoker . Objectives : - To study brain chemical activity relate cigarette smoke nicotine administration . - To compare brain chemical activity current daily smoker nonsmoker . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 50 year age either current smoker ( 10 25 cigarette daily least 2 year ) exposure tobacco never smoke regularly ( may maximum 20 cigarette lifetime none past year ) . Design : - Eligible participant undergo initial medical psychological screening neuropsychological test begin main phase study . Participants require abstain alcohol drug ( except caffeine , nicotine , prescription drug ) 24 hour session , smoker refrain smoke midnight night session . - Session 1 : Participants answer question nicotine crave withdrawal symptom , follow magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan provide baseline information brain activity . - Session 2 3 : Participants answer question nicotine crave withdrawal symptom , smoke one cigarette ( either active nicotine placebo ) . Researchers document participant consumption cigarette . After cigarette smoke , participant PET scan . Blood sample draw PET session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Smoking Opioid Receptor Binding : A PET Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine whether nicotine , dose deliver cigarette ( 1-2 mg ) , increase release endogenous opioids , measure displacement mu-opioid PET receptor radioligand [ ( 11 ) C ] carfentanil determine whether smoker adaptation opioid system compare nonsmoker . Study Population : 20 current , daily smoikers 20 never-smokers smoke 1 20 cigarette lifetime . Design : Double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group design . Outcome Measures : 1 ) displacement [ ( 11 ) C ] carfentanil binding , secondary release endorphins nicotine ; 2 ) upregulation [ ( 11 ) C ] carfentanil specific bind smoker compare nonsmoker ; 3 ) [ ( 11 ) C ] carfentanil specific bind function mu-opioid receptor A118G polymorphism ; 4 ) correlation self-report measure nicotine effect [ ( 11 ) C ] carfentanil bind profile .</detailed_description>
