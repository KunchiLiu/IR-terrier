	<detailed_description>Background : There increase awareness need adequate sedation analgesia critically ill pediatric patient . The choice treatment pain numerous , Pediatric ICU parenteral opioids commonly use . At equipotent dos , mu agonist opioids ( morphine , fentanyl , meperidine codeine ) produce similar physiologic effect side effect . Opioids cause hypoventilation , hypotension , constipation , may cause urinary retention . Patients receive continuous opioid infusion experience physiologic side effect , also side effect dependence , tolerance withdrawal . These lastly name side effect often complicate medical issue contribute long ICU admission . There numerous article address problem opioid tolerance , dependence , withdrawal . Despite repeated effort , mechanism tolerance remain unclear . Current in-vitro in-vivo investigation focus five theory opioid tolerance : receptor down-regulation , desensitization , internalization , alternative coupling , functional antagonism . Recent study suggest receptor down-regulation main mechanism in-vivo . Desensitization receptor decoupling , receptor internalization increase alternative couple stimulatory G-proteins demonstrate clinically insignificant . However , functional antagonism opioid effect seem clinically important . This functional antagonism mediate activation N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , up-regulation adenylyl cyclase nitric oxide synthase . Drugs block mechanism promise treatment opioid tolerance . Numerous in-vivo study focus block NMDA receptor . Studies animal show decrease development opioid tolerance NMDA antagonist use . This effect escalate next level investigation several adult case report randomize control trial demonstrate patient receive small , sub-anesthetic dos ketamine respond subsequent dramatic decrease opioid requirement . The dos ketamine use case report vary , 1mg/kg/24 hour ( 0.04mg/kg/hr ) , 0.1mg/kg/hr . Bell recently review four randomize control trial cancer patient receive ketamine adjuvant opioids pain . Dosing route ketamine vary trial . He cautiously conclude promise potential efficacy ketamine adjuvant opioids cancer pain . Another review report coadministration ketamine reduce pain , analgesic consumption , study . Suresh Anand anecdotally report use 0.2mg/kg/hr-0.5mg/kg/hr child resultant decrease need escalate morphine infusion rate . Part difficulty determine appropriate pediatric dose lack clinical study evaluate ketamine adjuvant opioids child . There numerous attempt adult evaluate effect add ketamine opioids improve pain management . Many study review Subraminiam . Of fifty-seven study review , seven use continuous infusion IV ketamine addition opioids . Of seven study , four report significantly improve analgesia addition ketamine . Of fifty-seven study , four evaluate ketamine adjuvant opioids child . All study evaluate postoperative pain control one use continuous infusion ketamine . Of four one , evaluate preoperative ketamine administration , show improvement pain control . In future , anticipate conducting randomize , blind , placebo control trial evaluate effect low dose ketamine development opioid tolerance . However , standardize dose ketamine role . The goal phase I trial establish dose continuous infusion ketamine use future study , pharmacokinetic detail ketamine continuous infusion dose . There currently data describe pharmacokinetics low dose ketamine child . These detail would include plasma concentration , elimination rate , half-life ketamine primary metabolite norketamine . In addition expand available data ketamine information could useful future study . It report ketamine cause sedation child serum level 1 1.5 ug/ml , level less 0.5ug/ml sedative effect . The assumption make level less 1ug/ml ketamine non-sedating , test . While opioids consider analgesic , also sedative property often first-line drug sedation Pediatric ICU 's even true analgesia require . Fentanyl frequently use Pediatric ICU Children 's Medical Center Dallas sedation/analgesia patient require mechanical ventilation . A future study would use percent increase fentanyl dose measure tolerance . Patients would receive ketamine placebo , addition fentanyl infusion standard care sedation Pediatric ICU . The fentanyl infusion would titrate per standard care , addition midazolam discretion primary team , maintain adequate sedation . As tolerance develop increase fentanyl dose maintain clinical effect . If ketamine inhibit development tolerance ketamine group remain adequately sedate small percent increase fentanyl . For sedation valid measure circumstance would know ketamine dose use non-sedating . The purpose study determine sedative property , pharmacokinetics , several low dose ketamine regimen . By determine sedative profile ketamine dos , able accurately define low dose ketamine dose nonsedating . Hypothesis : In PICU patient , age 3 year 18 year receive continuous fentanyl infusion and/or benzodiazepine infusion mechanical ventilation , low dose ketamine cause increase sedation baseline . Study Design : This phase I trial evaluate ketamine various dos pharmacokinetics effect over-sedation ( sedation increase significantly baseline define six point change ) accord COMFORT score . The COMFORT score objective scale develop measure distress pediatric critical care patient . Its use predict optimal sedation mechanically ventilate patient validate . We enroll patient admit Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Children 's Medical Center Dallas respiratory failure require intubation mechanical ventilation . The PICU Children 's Medical Center 44 bed ICU admit patient wide range medical problem . In 2005 118 patient admitted primary diagnosis respiratory failure . Another 147 patient secondary diagnosis respiratory failure . We anticipate enrol 15 patient course one year . Once patient enrol , COMFORT score administer nursing staff every four hour . When patient score seventeen twenty-six two successive occasion , need alteration sedation regimen , consider optimally sedate . At time ketamine infusion initiate per standard infusion pump . Ketamine administer infusion twelve hour . The ketamine dose administer within dosage range ketamine use prior literature . It felt dose non-sedating . The first five patient enrol receive ketamine 0.01mg/kg/hr . The COMFORT score continue administer every four hour twelve hour patient receives ketamine infusion . If COMFORT score less seventeen , patient consider over-sedated , medication adjustment make primary team . The ketamine infusion continue fentanyl and/or midazolam dose adjust accord primary care team . If COMFORT score twenty-six , patient consider under-sedated require medication adjustment . The ketamine infusion change fentanyl midazolam adjust accord primary care team . The COMFORT score repeat one hour medication change . If COMFORT score consistent optimal sedation medication change make . If , opinion primary team , patient require level sedation result COMFORT score low 17 patient remove study . Any patient require change fentanyl midazolam infusion remove study . If possible ketamine infusion complete serum level draw patient include sedation portion study . Prior enrol patient next dose , ensure serum level less 1ug/ml . If level satisfactory , enrollment begin next dose . The dos study 0.01mg/kg/hr , 0.1mg/kg/hr , 0.5mg/kg/hr . By enrol five patient dose , able accurately define pharmacokinetics well sedation profile . In order determine pharmacokinetics ketamine , blood sample determine serum concentration ketamine primary metabolite , norketamine obtain . Whole blood sample 400ul obtain via available venous arterial catheter . If catheter available blood may obtain via heel stick per current PICU standard . Serum sample obtain prior start ketamine infusion , six hour start infusion , twelve hour start infusion . Three additional sample obtain two , four , six hour discontinue infusion . Assuming one compartment open model first order elimination follow parameter estimate : Plasma concentration , volume distribution , elimination rate , half-life , dose steady state concentration . The elimination half-life determine slope best-fit concentration versus time plot follow discontinuation ketamine infusion . Ketamine norketamine analyze use qualified LC-MS/MS method . Throughout study , patient monitor adverse event . Should patient develop adverse event related current medical condition include limited nausea , vomit , hypotension , hypertension , tachycardia , tremulousness , increase tone extremity , seizure , cardiac arrhythmia , and/or hallucination otherwise explain current medical condition , ketamine infusion discontinue . Serum sample elimination half-life obtain two , four six hour discontinue infusion .</detailed_description>
