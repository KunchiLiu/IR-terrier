This finding come primarily multifaceted intervention , however , impact medication modification , , remain largely unknown . This study use randomize controlled clinical trial design evaluate fall prevention program target community-dwelling older adult community pharmacy . The study focus individual high risk future fall . Individuals intervention group receive in-depth consultation concern current medication , conduct community pharmacist . The consultation design elicit medication-related problem ( e.g. , orthostatic hypotension , daytime sedation ) .

With physician approval , appropriate modification make patient 's medication regimen . The primary study endpoint : time first fall proportion individual fall one-year follow-up period . Two primary hypothesis test . 1 . Compared individual control group , individual intervention group experience 30 % reduction hazard fall ( hazard ratio=0.70 ) time first fall follow randomization . 2 . Compared individual control group , 25 % few people intervention group experience fall one-year follow-up period . If intervention effective reduce fall , effect mediate improvement overall quality medication use . Thus , also assess effect intervention : change number inappropriate medication prescribe change number CNS-active medication prescribe . One secondary hypothesis test . 1 .
