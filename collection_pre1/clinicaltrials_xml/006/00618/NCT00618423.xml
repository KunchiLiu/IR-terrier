	<brief_summary>After surgical operation , patient may suffer chronic pain . Ketamine , well know anesthetic act receptor spine ( NMDA receptor ) , implied occurrence chronic pain . The mechanism call central sensation . It known Ketamine reduces immediate postoperative pain , effectiveness prevention chronic pain still unknown . The investigator study follow patient one year operation occurrence chronic pain . The investigator hypothesis Ketamine reduces significantly chronic postoperative pain major back surgery improve patient outcome . There may important inter-individual difference person react drug . These difference partly determine gene individual . The investigator study include therefore genetic analysis . Psychological social factor also influence perception pain .

	<brief_title>The Effect Perioperative Ketamine Acute Chronic Pain After Major Back Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background 1 . Ketamine adjuvant multimodal postoperative analgesia impact development chronic neuropathic pain : Ketamine , phenylcyclidine derivate , develop 1960 's use general anesthetic . The pharmacological mechanism ketamine remain unclear long time . However , recently , antagonistic role ketamine N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor identify . Consequently , suggest ketamine use adjuvant multimodal pain treatment . During last 15 year , large number clinical trial publish test ketamine management acute postoperative pain . Three meta-analyses confirm opioid spar effect immediate postoperative period , decrease post-operative pain intensity , increase delay first request rescue analgesia patient randomise intraoperative ketamine [ Elia &amp; Tramèr , 2005 ; Bell et al , 2005 ; Himmelseher &amp; Durieux , 2005 ] . There evidence increase incidence nightmare unpleasant dreams patient receive low-dose ketamine adjuvant general anesthetic [ Elia &amp; Tramèr , 2005 ] . Additionally short-term perioperative effect , ketamine suppose reduce development chronic neuropathic postoperative pain NMDA receptor blockade reduction wind-up central sensitization [ Woolf 2000 ] . Chronic postoperative pain major source morbidity [ Perkins &amp; Kehlet , 2000 ] . Certain type surgery , breast surgery , thoracotomy , inguinal hernia repair limb amputation consider `` high risk '' intervention develop neuropathic pain . After thoracotomy , instance , incidence chronic neuropathic pain 60 % report . A study look long-term outcome . In small pilot study , beneficial effect ketamine persistent painful sensation around scar observe 6 month surgery [ De Kock et al , 2001 ] . Chronic neuropathic pain remain important therapeutic challenge . The pathophysiology neuropathic pain show central sensitisation might play important role hyperactivity/ hyperexcitability spinal/supraspinal nociceptive neuron . Ketamine , modulate NMDA receptor , know reduce neuropathic pain might even prevent . Furthermore , opioid resistance neuropathic pain common feature thermal sensory deficit within painful area predictive intensity opioid response . In order improve understand frequently observe variability response rate ketamine , describe detail low back pain cohort intend study , address two issue ; first , pharmacogenetics ketamine , second , psychosocial factor may influence perception postoperative pain may predict response ketamine patient without chronic low back pain . 2 . Pharmacogenetics ketamine : Factors affect individual response drug genetic non-genetic , instance , compliance , age , body fat , nutrition , concomitant disease ( liver kidney disease ) , drug toxic substance ( tobacco , alcohol , environmental pollutant ) . The individual response drug influence combination pharmacokinetic ( absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion ) pharmacodynamic process . Each process , well underlie pathological painful condition , involve genetic environmental factor affect response analgesic . The consistent predictable factor might possibly genetic one , thus pharmacogenetics may help individualize drug treatment accordance genetic `` make-up '' patient . Pharmacogenetic test available clinical practice might help good identify best analgesic also estimate optimal dose individual patient . Finally , genetic knowledge lead mechanism-based approach discovery new analgesic . Polymorphic drug metabolize enzyme drug transporter affect pharmacokinetics drug whereas polymorphic drug target disease relate pathway influence pharmacodynamic action drug [ Samer et al , 2006 ] . Prospective trial urgently need study inherit susceptibility may lead lack therapeutic analgesic efficacy , dose-dependent induced adverse drug reaction . We choose high-priority candidate polymorphism predict would associate pain-related response resistance post-operative pain treatment . CYP2C9 , CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 alleles involve metabolism analgesic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , ketamine , tramadol , ondansetron ( review , see [ Samer et al , 2006 ] ) . As pain sensitivity morphine response variability , meet allele val158met polymorphism catechol-O-methyltransferase gene ( COMT ) , reduce ability enzyme metabolize catecholamine , associate decrease opioid consumption cancer pain patient . Furthermore , COMT polymorphisms interacts nociceptive emotional system since variability experimentally evoke pain threshold link genetic polymorphism [ Zubieta et al , 2003 ] . Unpleasant pain-related affect , anxiety disorder also associate polymorphism [ Olsson et al , 2005 ] . The met allele associate depression anxious temperament ; well know risk factor develop chronic pain [ Hwang et al , 2005 ] . In addition priori selection putative gene , carry exploratory analyzes polymorphisms additional gene previously genotype pain genetics study . We recognize correction multiple test might need cohort several hundred patient ; thus , observation analyze may suitable generate hypothesis future study . 3 . Psychosocial factor pain perception patient back pain undergoing surgery : Pain intensity strongly associate disability . Aside importance symptom , function , general well-being , work status , satisfaction care propose core set outcomes clinical trial routine care setting [ Mannion et al , 2005 ] . Psychological distress depressive mood increase risk chronicity . A systematic review evaluate psychological predictor chronicity disability prospective cohort low back pain patient [ Pincus et al , 2002 ] . Increased risk chronicity ( i.e . persist symptom and/or disability ) result psychological distress depressive mood emerge main finding . Patients ' belief expectation pain problem also seem influence recovery process . Patients ' expectation treatment show influence outcome , i.e . functional improvement , example , link intrinsical value treatment also patient ' expectation possible benefit . Lutz et al show patient high expectation surgery well outcome low expectation [ Lutz et al , 1999 ] . Iversen et al find patient many preoperative expectation tend improve few expectation [ Iversen et al , 1998 ] . More ambitious expectation physical function also associate improved function satisfaction physical function ; however , high expectation pain relief associate great report pain decreased satisfaction pain relief , thus suggest type expectation address differently preoperative discussion . Investigating relationship expect result actual outcomes , McGregor &amp; Hughes assess patient ' expectation surgery , satisfaction outcome term pain , function , disability general health 6 week , 6 month 1 year [ McGregor &amp; Hughes , 2002 ] . The result show patient high expectation recovery confident achieve recovery . As satisfaction , however , patient ' report review stage indicate surgery achieve part expect , suggest patient unrealistic expectation lead low satisfaction level . Painful experience may accompany catastrophizing cognition , i.e . pessimistic beliefs expectation regard self , others future , may give rise feeling helplessness concern one 's ability cope life event . This may lead pain-related fear , avoidance behavior , reduce activity . Disability disuse may ensue associate depression , thus increase pain catastrophizing set motion vicious circle . When back pain associate catastrophizing thought , absence fear allow confrontation activity eventually recovery [ Vlaeyen &amp; Linton , 2000 ] . This model refer cognitive factor ( e.g . meaning pain , expectation regard control pain , maladaptive thought ) behavioural response may active ( e.g . carry daily activity , exercise ) passive ( e.g . rest , give control , withdrawal activity ) [ Picavet et al , 2002 ] .</detailed_description>
