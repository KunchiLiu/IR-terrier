The apparent success use probiotic several gut disorder ( e.g. , IBD ) together great understanding role inflammation intestinal microflora pathophysiology IBS lead increase interest use probiotic patient IBS ( 3 ) . The data use probiotic IBS limit . However , report study show encouraging result suggest symptomatic response parallel improvement quality life ( 3-4 ) . A controlled , double-blind study , randomize 20 patient IBS L. plantarum 299v placebo 4 week conclude L. plantarum decrease abdominal pain tend normalize stool frequency constipate patient ( 5 ) . On hand , Lactobacillus casei GG , find improve stool consistency patient IBS diarrhea ( 6 ) . A recent randomized control trial use probiotic formulation VSL # 3 improved abdominal bloating patient diarrhea-predominant IBS . However , difference gastrointestinal transit measurement , bowel function score satisfactory global symptom relief show ( 7 ) . The inconsistent finding clinical study may account difference probiotic composition heterogeneous multifactorial nature disorder . However , study indicate potential relationship probiotic therapy functional abdominal symptom suggest possible role probiotic treatment IBS deserve study .</detailed_description>
