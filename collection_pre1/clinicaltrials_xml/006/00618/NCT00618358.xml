	<brief_summary>Study Objective : To evaluate safety effectiveness Vascular Sealant compare Gelfoam/Thrombin use seal bleeding anastomotic suture line patient undergo vascular reconstructive surgery require placement PTFE graft ( include extra-anatomic , infrainguinal bypass arteriovenous ( AV ) access procedure ) . Study Design : The study multi-center , prospective , randomize control clinical trial compare two method treat anastomotic leakage ( bleed ) . All subject ( n =151 ) randomize 3:1 ratio receive either investigational treatment ( Vascular Sealant ) control treatment ( Gelfoam/Thrombin ) . Up two ( 2 ) treatment site may evaluate subject . Subjects stratify type graft procedure : AV access graft extra-anatomic infra-inguinal graft . A minimum 60 patient , maximum 91 patient , enrol stratum . Treatment randomization block center type graft procedure ( e.g. , bypass AV graft ) . All subject undergo preoperative screening determine eligibility evaluate intraoperatively , discharge within 7 day surgery , 30 day post-procedure monitor hematologic disturbance , hemorrhagic event , wound complication potential acute post-operative adverse event . Up ten ( 10 ) investigational site participate study . Enrollment expect take approximately 8 month anticipate duration clinical investigation approximately 9 10 month . The primary objective trial demonstrate non-inferiority Vascular Sealant Gelfoam/Thrombin use seal anastomotic suture line patient undergo placement PTFE vascular graft ( include extra-anatomic , infrainguinal bypass arteriovenous access procedure ) .</brief_summary>
