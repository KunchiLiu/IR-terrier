	<brief_title>Using Furosemide Prevent Fluid Overload During Red Blood Cell Transfusion Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Red cell transfusion common practice neonate , particularly preterm infant . It estimate approximately 300,000 neonate undergo transfusion annually . The decision administer blood transfusion sick anemic neonate make consideration multiple clinical factor , include : poor weight gain , oxygenation failure , recurrent apnea bradycardia . These decision also influence physician preference . For many year , furosemide use routinely physicians blood transfusion neonates age group . The rationale behind common practice reduce vascular overload may impose additional blood volume deliver transfusion . This belief , however , lack support scientific clinical evaluation .</detailed_description>
