	<brief_summary>The purpose trial examine benefit early combination CellCept® Rebif® long-term management patient multiple sclerosis . Quantitation mRNA MxA gene ex-vivo lymphocyte obtain patient receive drug interferon alone use gauge usefulness combination therapy . In addition examine safety combination mycophenolate mofetil interferon beta 1a treatment multiple sclerosis . This pilot study examine combination CellCept® Rebif® prove useful early treatment patient MS. Up-regulation MxA gene follow administration Rebif® use surrogate marker interferon bioactivity . This turn could serve surrogate marker interferon efficacy patient . The null hypothesis difference proportion patient produce MxA gene transcript Rebif® group compare group receive Rebif® CellCept® end study ( 1 year ) . The alternate hypothesis combination CellCept® Rebif® prove useful prolong efficacy interferon . In word , combination result significant proportion patient treatment group continue produce MxA compare proportion patient produce MxA Rebif® arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 30 patient study , fifteen arm . Proportional analysis sample size estimation could do since proportion MxA positive patient 1 year Rebif® treatment arm unknown . Nevertheless , sample size 15 patient per arm allow detection suitable difference treatment group outline : For purpose study MxA non-producer designate `` treatment failure '' irrespective clinical status . The definition MxA non-producer patient produce 1 year treatment ; MxA transcript level 2 SD his/her mean baseline value entry . Accordingly , patient compare initial response Rebif® entry study . In follow example proportion MxA non-producers group use comparison . At end 1 year , incidence neutralizing antibody patient receive Rebif® 44 microgram SC tiw approximately 20 % . For purpose calculation sample size , proportion 40 % ( 0.4 ) choose MxA non-producers Rebif® arm , since proportion patient fail produce MxA 1 year high proportion show neutralizing antibody . In word , mechanism neutralize antibody basis interferon unresponsiveness patient , important phenomenon lose detection sole focus restrict neutralizing antibody . Assuming combination effective maintain biological activity interferon 1 year patient , follow scenario identify . Patients randomly assign either receive Rebif without CellCept . The randomization process utilize computer program design specifically randomize patient . Patients equal chance randomize receive Rebif without CellCept therapy . Each subject must meet following eligibility criterion ( i.e. , Inclusion criterion Exclusion criterion ) enrollment study : Inclusion Criteria - Male female subject clinically eligible interferon therapy , include diagnosis relapse multiple sclerosis ( accord MacDonald criterion , revised 2005 ) , patient diagnose clinically isolated syndrome . - Patients must age 18 65 , inclusive - Subjects must adequate cognitive function understand sign IRB-approved consent prior performance study-specific procedure . Exclusion Criteria - Females pregnant breastfeeding , females childbearing potential ( i.e . surgically sterile least two year postmenopausal ) engage active heterosexual relation , hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , use one follow birth control method : tubal ligation , implantable contraceptive device , oral , patch injectable contraceptive , barrier method , sexual activity restrict vasectomized partner exclude study due potential risk unborn fetus and/or nursing infant . - Subject clinically significant abnormal laboratory value . An abnormal value define CTCAE Version 3.0 , Grade 2 bad lab value determine clinically significant Principal Investigator . - Subject received corticosteroid within 30 day prior screen visit . - Subject receive cyclophosphamide mitoxantrone . - Subject receive Imuran methotrexate last 3 month . - Subject medical condition , history medical condition , would interfere interpretation study result conduct study determine investigator . This may include autoimmune disease , history cancer , uncontrolled hypertension , myelodysplastic syndrome uncontrolled cardiac , hepatic , renal pulmonary history determine investigator clinically significant . - Subject participating participate another clinical trial receive another investigational therapy last 90 day . Primary measure efficacy : - Analysis proportion patient MxA producer group receive Rebif® CellCept® , compare proportion patient Rebif® alone MxA producer . - Comparison mean MxA level Rebif® CellCept® group Rebif® alone . The null hypothesis difference two treatment arm regard level mRNA MxA . The alternate hypothesis treatment arm sustain high level mRNA compare Rebif® alone treatment group . Secondary measure efficacy - Clinical status , include number severity clinical exacerbation , severity exacerbation , time first second exacerbation , disability measure Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite ( MSFC ) use corticosteroid 1 year study . - Tolerance interferon clinical burden disease measure Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life Index ( MSQLI ) . - Break-through disease detect gadolinium enhancement lesion MRI conclusion study . - Total burden T2 FLAIR disease combination arm compare Rebif® alone conclusion study . Measuring MxA MxA level patient determine measure relative amount MxA mRNA peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) isolate blood . Blood collect preservative free heparin tube PBMCs isolate Ficoll-Histopaque gradient centrifugation . The PBMCs harvest , wash , total cell count establish . Total RNA isolate cell . RNA convert cDNA reverse transcription reaction . Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) perform establish level gene activation MxA . As standard PCR , oligonucleotide primer temperature cycle use amplify target sequence template DNA . With real-time PCR , oligonucleotide `` probe '' add mix . This probe high-energy `` reporter '' dye 5 ' end low-energy `` quencher '' dye 3 ' end . The probe design anneal specific portion target DNA sequence . When probe intact , proximity quencher dye reporter dye suppress natural fluorescence . As DNA polymerase make copy template DNA molecule mix , attach probe cleave , distance reporter quencher dyes increase , cause fluorescent emission reporter also increase . Fluorescence measure throughout temperature cycle PCR reaction . Calculations make base detected fluorescence determine amount initial template DNA present sample . Because impossible determine exact number MxA mRNA molecule sample start , real-time PCR do detect level GAPDH , standard housekeep gene , sample comparison GAPDH MxA make , relative quantity determine different sample . Measuring T2 FLAIR Total burden T2 FLAIR measure semi-automated computer program use within radiology department . The software outline lesion within scanned area . Once map , MRIs review Dr. Eric Bourekas measurement quantification total disease burden . Detailed study procedure Treatment Schedule Eligible patient randomize receive treatment without mycophenolate mofetil 2,000 mg per day 6 month . After 4 week therapy group receive Rebif® standard dose 44 microgram SC TIW , standard titration dose regimen . Patients evaluate every 3 month one year . The patient 's total time study one year . Randomization occur Day 0 visit utilize computer program specifically create purpose . Patients 50 % chance receiving CellCept . End Study If patient develop medical condition , opinion investigator , would make unsafe continue study , patient remove study follow study safety , resolution event . Patient removal study evaluate case case basis investigator discretion carried ensure patient safety . If patient experience great 2 exacerbation require corticosteroid therapy ( moderate severe ) 12 month period , confirm progression Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) &gt; 2 point without exacerbation would consider treatment failure appropriate treatment arm would remove study pursue treatment option .</detailed_description>
