	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint Combined assessment clinical molecular data obtain three sequential study visit investigative period 36 month individual ; include , particular , identification single cluster gene function connect deterioration stability pulmonary function end observation period . Secondary endpoint Assessment occupational environmental exposure primarily inert fine dust random subset stratum mean 24h-measurement quantity quality fine dust inhalation ; Influence intensify exposure fine dust due occupational condition ; Development lung function five different study group ( see ) , particularly change one GOLD class next class ; Definition Study Groups : Group 1 ( Control ) : Healthy volunteer , age 18 35 yr , never smoker ( n=20 ) . Group 2 ( preferentially taxi bus driver ; COPD °0 ) : Working men/women , age 18 65 yr , preferentially taxi driver bus driver comparable occupational burden , current smoker ex-smokers , symptom suggestive COPD , yet regular lung function test rest time study entry , sign significant disease , particular sign cardiovascular disease ( n=35 ) . Group 3 ( preferentially taxi bus driver ; COPD °I-III ) : Working men/women , preferentially taxi driver bus driver comparable occupational burden , age 35 65 yr , current smoker ex-smokers , symptom COPD , abnormal lung function rest time study entry , sign significant disease , particular sign cardiovascular disease ( n=35 ) . Group 4 ( Welder ; COPD °0 ) : Working men/women , active welder comparable occupational burden , age 35 65 yr , current smoker ex-smoker , symptom suggestive COPD , yet regular lung function test rest , sign significant disease , particular sign cardiovascular disease ( n=35 ) . Group 5 ( Welder ; COPD °I-III ) : Working men/women , active welder comparable occupational burden , age 35 65 yr , current smoker ex-smoker , symptom COPD abnormal lung function rest time study entry , sign significant disease , particular sign cardiovascular disease ( n=35 ) .
