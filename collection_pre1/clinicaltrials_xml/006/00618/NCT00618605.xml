	<detailed_description>HIV infection continue spread pandemic level throughout world . Control pandemic achieve development safe effective preventive HIV vaccine . A vaccine prevent HIV infection elicit strong immune response CD4 CD8 cell . Recombinant adenovirus serotype vector show elicit response . The purpose study determine safety immunogenicity recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 preventive HIV-1 vaccine . This study last 12 month . Participants randomly assign one four arm receive different dos vaccine placebo administer via intermuscular injection . Participants Arms 1 , 2 , 3 receive 3 injection . Each injection contain dose vaccine . Arm 4 receive 2 injection dose vaccine determine safety data Arms 1 , 2 , 3 . Participants enrol sequentially , low high dose vaccine , Arms 1 , 2 , 3 .
