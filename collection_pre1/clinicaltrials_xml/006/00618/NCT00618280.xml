	<brief_title>Social Cognition , Attentional Network Nicotine Drug Dependency - A Pharmacological Clinical Trail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nicotine improve attentional capacity go along activation attentional network brain . So far , however , unresolved whether nicotine use purpose self-medication nicotine-dependent subject suffer subclinical clinical attentional deficit may sustain nicotine addiction . In present study , investigate healthy subject schizophrenic patient frequently show low attentional capacity functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electrophysiology ( EEG ) attention-requiring task assess level attentional network activity . It anticipate low attentional network activity ( baseline condition , nicotine challenge withdrawal ) predict degree nicotine dependence include strength withdrawal symptom relapse rate smoking cessation . In addition , expect functional variation within alpha4beta2 nAch receptor genotype associate attentional capacity -by extension - nicotine dependence . Additionally Self-medication attentional deficit increase stress vulnerability may contribute nicotine-dependence schizophrenia patient healthy subject . However , little known effect nicotine stress schizophrenia . In particular social stressor highly relevant schizophrenia often result social withdrawal . A factor contribute stress-eliciting nature social interaction misidentification social information communication others . The present project aim investigation nicotine effect social information process neurophysiological correlate social stress response . Using 2x2-factorial design effect nicotine vs. placebo experimentally investigate smoke schizophrenia patient comparison smoke healthy control overnight smoke deprivation . Nicotine administer nasal spray deliver systemic 2 mg nicotine . Event-related EEG potential record presentation picture facial affect neutral control stimuli assess social information process neurophysiological correlate . In addition videotape semi-standardized conversation skill role-play test use social stress situation ass self-reported non-verbal affective response .</detailed_description>
