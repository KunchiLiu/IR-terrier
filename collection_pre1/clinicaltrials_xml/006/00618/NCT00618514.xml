	<brief_summary>This trial design prospective , multi-center , randomized clinical trial FDA-cleared Vari-Lase Bright Tip Fiber compare commercially available standard bare-tip laser fiber ( control ) demonstrate safety effectiveness laser ablation treatment varicose vein associate reflux within great saphenous vein ( GSV ) provide additional data concern patient satisfaction . Within evaluation , subject limb randomize one two ( 2 ) treatment group utilize 1:1 randomization ratio . If subject require treatment one limb , limb randomize treatment group . If subject require treatment two limb , first limb randomly assign treatment second limb assign treatment ( opposite treatment limb ) . The data analyze treated limb ( versus treat subject ) .All study data analyze principle intent-to-treat , data analyze accord assign randomized group regardless treatment actually deliver . Subjects follow one week , one month , six month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial design prospective , multi-center , randomized clinical trial FDA-cleared Vari-Lase Bright Tip Fiber compare commercially available standard bare-tip laser fiber ( control ) demonstrate safety effectiveness laser ablation treatment varicose vein associate reflux within great saphenous vein ( GSV ) provide additional data concern patient satisfaction . Subjects pre-screened utilizing standard care data ( include document evidence reflux within GSV ) specify inclusion/exclusion criterion ensure eligible treatment investigation . Prior laser treatment signing informed consent form , study eligibility assessment complete include physical assessment target limb ( ) , duplex ultrasound GSV segment ( ) target treatment , symptom assessment , medical history , digital photo target limb . Upon enrollment , target limb randomize 1:1 ratio receive Vari-lase Bright Tip Fiber control treatment . If subject require treatment two limb , first limb randomize second limb assign treatment ( opposite treatment limb ) . Immediately post procedure , subject assess adverse event physical assessment treat limb ( ) perform . Subjects also ask complete subject pain satisfaction questionnaire . Subjects follow one week , one month , six month . Follow-up include physical assessment treat limb ( ) , symptom assessment , adverse event assessment , completion subject pain satisfaction questionnaire . Additionally , duplex ultrasound assessment conduct one week six month digital photo take treated vein segment ( ) one week one month . The data analyze treated limb ( versus treat subject ) . All study data analyze principle intent-to-treat , data analyze accord assign randomized group regardless treatment actually deliver .</detailed_description>
