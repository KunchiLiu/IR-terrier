	<brief_summary>Background : Routine oral examination ( ROE ) refer periodic monitor general oral health status patient . In developed Western country decrease prevalence oral disease underpins need individualised approach assign recall interval regular attendee instead systematic decision make fix interval . From quality care perspective well , one also question effectiveness widespread prophylactic removal mandibular impact asymptomatic third molar ( MIM ) adolescents adult . It yet unclear quality oral care improve . Research data effectiveness intervention promote continue professional development dentist rare . Methods/Design : This implementation study cluster randomise control trial group GDPs unit randomisation . The aim study determine effectiveness efficiency small group quality improvement professional decision make general dental practitioner ( GDPs ) daily practice . Six peer group ( 'IQual-groups ' ) shall randomise either intervention group I group II . Groups GDPs allocate either arm act 's control group . An IQual peer group consist 8-10 GDPs attend monthly structure session schedule discussion practice relate topic . GDPs trail arm receive recent develop evidence-based CPG ROE MIM respectively . The implementation strategy consist 1 interactive IQual circle meeting mostly 2-3 hour . In addition , group GDPs receive feedback personal group characteristic invite make use web-based patient vignette individual training risk assessment policy . A week interactive meeting reminder ( flow chart ) send mail . The main outcome measure ROE-study control group use appropriateness individualise risk assessment assign recall interval MIM-study use appropriateness individualise mandibular impacted third molar risk management . Measurements ( pre-intervention data collection ) take place month 1-3 , start September 2006 . Post-intervention data collection perform 9 month . Discussion : In developed Western country decrease prevalence oral disease underpins need individualised approach assign recall interval regular attendee . If evaluation multifaceted implementation study reveals shift individual performance GDPs assess risk oral disease , research question effort risk-based professional education could promote . Scientific hypothesis Multifaceted implementation consensus base clinical practice guideline ( CPGs ) GDPs ROEs management asymptomatic impacted third molar ( MIM ) daily dental practice effective efficient compare dissemination CPGs .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>GDPs inclusion criterion GDPs work general dental practice least three days/week practice experience least three year . They eligible practice population characterise primary oral care patient , consist regular attendee , patient recordkeeping conduct electronically . GDPs give inform consent ass evaluate electronically patient record . Patient data collect anonymously . Patient 's inclusion criterion To eligible inclusion , patient meet ( fulfil ) several criterion , depend IQual 's CPG use ( ROE MIM ) : ROE : All patient regularly visit dentist ( least year ) past three year ROEs include study . MIM : All patient regularly visit dentist ( least year ) past three year ROEs include study , addition , age 17 35 year , diseasefree impact mandibular third molar retention . For group patient , important link particular participate GDP , especially practice one GDP occupy Patient 's exclusion criterion ROE : Patients symptomatic driven ( emergency ) attendance dental practice , recently start regular attendance participate dental practice ( within past three year ) . MIM : Patients symptomatic third molar dental practice , recently start regular attendance ( past three year ) already third molar remove .</criteria>
