	<detailed_description>Stratatech complete phase I/IIa clinical study ass safety efficacy escalate amount StrataGraft skin tissue patient complex skin defect require sequential debridement temporary wound coverage biological dress prior autografting . The specific objective phase I/IIa clinical trial ass safety StrataGraft skin tissue use predetermined panel clinical laboratory endpoint assess efficacy StrataGraft skin tissue compare ability StrataGraft skin tissue standard care , human cadaver skin , condition complex skin defect subsequent autografting . In three cohort five patient , maximum amount StrataGraft skin tissue apply excised full-thickness skin wound increase sequentially 0.5 % 1.0 % , 1.5 % TBSA . Equivalent study wind area subject treat StrataGraft cadaver allograft one week , time allograft tissue remove wound bed evaluate . Infection appearance temporary allogeneic skin tissue evaluate every study session autograft placement . The wound cover split-thickness skin autograft wind judged ready accept autograft . Autograft take assessed two week autograft placement .</detailed_description>
