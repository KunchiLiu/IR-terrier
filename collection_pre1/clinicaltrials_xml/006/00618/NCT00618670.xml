	<brief_title>Home-based v . Supervised Exercise People With Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seek 1 ) compare change ambulatory function , vascular function , health-related quality life patient limited intermittent claudication follow home-based exercise rehabilitation program , supervised exercise program , light resistance training exercise program ; 2 ) determine whether change walk efficiency , calf muscle circulation , calf muscle oxygen reason home-based supervised exercise rehabilitation improve ambulatory function . We hypothesize home-based exercise program utilizing new physical activity monitoring technology accurately quantify exercise adherence well intensity , duration , volume exercise session result similar change ambulatory function , vascular function , health-related quality life compare standard , supervised exercise program . Further , home-based supervise exercise rehabilitation program result great change ambulatory function , vascular function , health-related quality life light resistance training exercise program . Finally , hypothesize change walk efficiency , calf muscle circulation , calf muscle oxygen predictive improve ambulation follow home-based exercise program well supervised exercise program . The 3-month program consist walk 3 time per week , progressive increase duration intensity . The two walking exercise program match estimate caloric expenditure training session . Patients control group perform light resistance training without walk exercise .</detailed_description>
