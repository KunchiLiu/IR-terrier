	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn whether high dos stem cell help decrease symptom occur melphalan . Another goal study see dose infused stem cell affect level certain protein blood . Researchers also want learn dose stem cell receive affect quality life week transplant procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Two Stem Cell Doses To Reduce Transplant Induced Symptom Burden</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stem cell find bone marrow bloodstream , rebuild blood , bone marrow , immune system . This study use autologous stem cell , stem cell collect blood . Melphalan design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die . Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) design help bone marrow make white blood cell . G-CSF use study help move stem cell bone marrow bloodstream . If doctor decides need , also receive chemotherapy help blood stem cell move bone marrow blood . This allow stem cell collect . Researchers also want learn dose infused stem cell affect level certain cytokine blood . Cytokines protein cause symptom fatigue fever . Treatment Plan : If find eligible take part study , need central venous catheter ( CVC ) place . A CVC flexible sterile tube place large vein run collarbone . Having CVC allow blood drawn medication give easily less discomfort . You ask sign separate consent form CVC place , procedure fully explain time . If doctor decides need , receive chemotherapy help blood stem cell move bone marrow blood . You ask sign separate consent form chemotherapy . Starting day stem cell infusion , receive G-CSF injection skin . You G-CSF injected twice day 10 day . The injection may give home , possible . You taught inject G-CSF , someone agree responsible give injection may also teach . Once number stem cell bloodstream high enough , stem cell collect course 2-5 day . You ask sign separate consent form stem cell collection , process describe detail time . Not count blood return , 32 tablespoon blood drawn stem cell collection . You keep receive daily G-CSF injection day stem cell collect . A procedure call apheresis use collect stem cell . During apheresis , blood collect either CVC vein one arm . The blood process machine remove stem cell , rest blood return CVC vein arm . The apheresis procedure last several hour time . You ask sign separate consent form apheresis procedure . You enough stem cell collect able either 1 transplant high dos stem cell 2 transplant standard dos stem cell . Your stem cell frozen ( cryopreserved ) give back . About 2 week stem cell collect , chemotherapy melphalan . The melphalan give 30 minute CVC . Since treatment destroy normal bone marrow addition myeloma cell , blood stem cell must give back . This blood stem cell able refill bone marrow . If doctor think need , may admit hospital day receive melphalan receive fluid vein hydrate . Two ( 2 ) day receive melphalan , previously collect stem cell unfrozen give back CVC , similar blood transfusion . This call autologous stem cell transplant . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) receive either standard amount stem cell experimental amount stem cell . You 50/50 chance assign either group . After receive stem cell , give G-CSF injection skin . You keep G-CSF injection white blood cell count return normal . After stem cell give back , take 2 week enough blood cell make . During time , possible might make blood cell . If happens , may need several red blood cell platelet transfusion . You receive antibiotic infection occur , may need give feeding CVC . The entire stem cell transplantation process do outpatient basis , possible . Otherwise , may need stay hospital 3-4 week . After stem cell transplant complete , need return clinic follow-up visit least week month , often doctor feel necessary . The follow-up visit include test procedure standard care . Research blood ( 2-4 teaspoon time ) also draw Day -2 , Day 0 , Day +3 , Day +5 , Day +7 ; twice week week 2 3 ; week 4 immune system test . Questionnaires Physical Tests : At several time study , ask complete questionnaire symptom quality life . Sometimes questionnaire do phone automate phone system . Rating symptom use telephone system take less 5 minute call . The rest time questionnaire perform paper phone interview . You also ask perform physical test , include walk 6 minute get chair . The research nurse teach use telephone system measure symptom quality life . You perform physical function test complete symptom questionnaire . You also test sensitivity nerve arm legs . Blood ( 4-5 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Completing questionnaire task first visit take hour . During hospital stay clinic visit stem cell transplant , ask Day -2 ( 2 day transplant ) , Day 0 , Day +3 , Day +5 , Day +7 transplant fill paper questionnaire measure symptom . You also ask day complete brief task measure physical function . During Weeks 2 3 ask fill paper questionnaire twice week complete task physical function week . During Week 4 , ask fill questionnaire complete task physical function . During Week 4 , sensory test nerve arm leg also repeat . On day physical test , research nurse ask practice use telephone system measure symptom . After leave hospital clinic , telephone system call home . The call occur 1 time week Week 5 Week 12 transplant , 1 time month Months 3 , 6 , 12 ( +/- 1 month ) . The telephone system ask rate strong tolerable symptom , much symptom interfere daily life . During clinic visit occur 90 day transplant , ask complete brief task measure physical function , also last test nerve arm legs . You study 1 year . This investigational study . Melphalan autologous stem cell transplantation FDA-approved treatment myeloma amyloidosis . The medication treatment study commercially available . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
