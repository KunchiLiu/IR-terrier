	<brief_summary>In chronic CLI patient appropriate candidate endovascular procedure - many patient advanced age disease state - treatment regimen may include endovascular procedure percutaneous transluminal endovascular intervention , well reconstructive surgical procedure graft bypass . Amputation last resort limb salvage achieve . Despite success percutaneous intervention small coronary vessel lumen diameter less 3 mm , similar technique limit success lower extremity vessel . Infra-popliteal , knee endovascular intervention , commonly plague subacute thrombotic closure restenosis many 50 % treated patient . As result limited success , percutaneous procedure reserve severe case whereby limb loss imminent without intervention . In context , sick patient enrol trial poor outcome common regardless intervention . Agents promote intracellular cAMP accumulation , include prostacyclin analogue phosphodiesterase inhibitor , suppress smooth muscle proliferation , promote vasodilatation inhibit platelet aggregation . These property suggest prostacyclin analogue treprostinil useful adjunct peripheral endovascular intervention perhaps increase number patient CLI benefit peripheral endovascular intervention . An orally available prostacyclin analogue could represent important treatment advance prevention restenosis follow infrapopliteal angioplasty . In present study , safety efficacy oral UT-15C sustain release ( SR ) tablet compare placebo patient CLI undergoing infra-popliteal endovascular intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study UT-15C SR ( Oral Treprostinil ) Patients Undergoing Lower Limb Endovascular Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , placebo control , single-center , evaluation safety efficacy UT-15C SR compare placebo patient CLI plan infra-popliteal endovascular intervention procedure . Conventional therapy continue patient study . Conventional therapy define customary best medical practice investigative site CLI , include analgesic rest pain , debridement wound care ischemic wound , etc. , long care meet requirement study include prohibited therapy investigational medication . A total 20 patient prospectively randomize ( 1:1 ) conventional treatment placebo therapy conjunction endovascular procedure conventional treatment UT-15C SR therapy conjunction infrapopliteal endovascular procedure . Treatment UT-15C sustain release ( SR ) tablet ( 1.0 mg dosage strength ) placebo . Treatment initiate 1 mg twice daily dose escalation additional 1 mg twice daily every 5 day clinically indicate base upon presence know prostacyclin adverse event adverse event opinion investigator attributable UT-15C SR. Doses maximize throughout Treatment Phase maximum dose 5 mg twice daily end 12-weeks . Patients return institution endovascular procedure least 4 day start study drug continue study drug , throughout endovascular procedure Week 12 . All patient return clinic Weeks 2 , 6 12 Treatment Phase assessment , Weeks 26 52 follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
