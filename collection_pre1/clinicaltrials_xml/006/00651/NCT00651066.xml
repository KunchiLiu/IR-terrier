	<brief_summary>The overall aim project evaluate rifabutin ( RBT ) replacement rifampicin ( RMP ) , combine treatment tuberculosis HIV infection . RBT represent alternative RMP HIV infect patient half-life longer enzymatic induction effect appear less important associate antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) drug . This phase II trial determine precisely pharmacokinetics parameter RBT combination different ART regimens Vietnamese HIV infect patient pulmonary tuberculosis , order define optimal dos test large phase III trial compare safety , tolerability efficacy RBT RMP regimens .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients offer participated study start TB treatment . All enrol patient immediately switch rifabutin randomize , one RBT dose adapt allocated RBT regimen accord cross scheme . Three full pharmacokinetics profile perform different time point : initiation ARV , three week first RBT dosage three week secondRBT dosage . Patients refer national program treatment . A follow-up visit plan end antiTB treatment .</detailed_description>
