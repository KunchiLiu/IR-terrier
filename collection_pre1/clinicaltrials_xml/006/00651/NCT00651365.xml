	<brief_title>A Safety Dose-finding Study JNJ-38877605 Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JNJ-38877605 new drug develop treatment cancer . It inhibitor mesenchymal epithelial transition ( Met ) kinase , substance identify many cancer . This first study JNJ-38877605 administer man . This research study carry determine high dose JNJ-38877605 patient advanced refractory solid tumor tolerate . The study also test safety JNJ-38877605 . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory data , electrocardiogram , vital sign measurement , physical examination finding , Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) performance status . In patient effect food drug absorb also study . Throughout study , treatment give cycle 21 day long study drug take day . The number cycle depend effect drug patient whether patient benefit treatment . The design cycle may adjust course study , cycle shorter longer , include day patient receive treatment ( pause = intermittent treatment ) . It also possible drug take day . In case change drug administration schedule , schedule time visit blood/urine test may adapt accordingly , without increase number . During first treatment cycle , 2 3 overnight stay hospital require visit hospital cycle 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 may take 12 hour morning dose . From cycle 5 onwards , daytime visit every cycle , usually take less time . Patients informed current visit schedule enrollment throughout study . The dose JNJ-38877605 administer study start low increase study . The amount study drug take day individual patient depend patient enrolls study . If group patient severe side effect , next group patient get high dose . The dose increase patient severe side effect . The dose decrease 3 6 patient receive high amount drug severe side effect observe . The amount JNJ-38877605 patient 's blood measure study also look effect drug disease . The patient may continue treatment long benefit assessed response assessment throughout study patient unacceptable side effect . A follow-up visit patient take place within 14 day patient take last dose JNJ-38877605 . JNJ-38877605 provide 10 , 50 , 100 mg capsule oral use . JNJ-38877605 initially administer day orally although administration schedule may modify late stage study . JNJ-38877605 provide take-home formulation childproof high-density polyethylene bottle .</detailed_description>
