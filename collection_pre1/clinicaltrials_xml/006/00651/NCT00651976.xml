	<brief_title>Letrozole Treating Postmenopausal Women With Stage I , II III Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary To determine breast tumor continue exhibit high proliferation ( i.e. , Ki67 ) upon hormone deprivation ( letrozole ) , gene expression and/or mutational proteomic signature harbor molecule 'pathways ' biomarkers resistance endocrine therapy cause . The ultimate goal aim identify clinically-targetable pathway exploit enhance response survival patient ER+ breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral letrozole daily 7-21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 24 hour last dose letrozole , patient undergo total mastectomy segmental resection lymph node evaluation . Pre-treatment diagnostic breast tissue obtain . Patients undergo treatment undergo standard care mastectomy lumpectomy . Pre post treatment tumor tissue sample analyze Ki67 , P-ER , ER , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , caspase 3 immunohistochemistry ; RNA microarray .</detailed_description>
