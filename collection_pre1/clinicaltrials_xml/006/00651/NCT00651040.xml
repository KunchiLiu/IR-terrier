	<brief_title>Combined Treatment Methotrexate + Glucocorticoids Versus Glucocorticoids Alone Patients With PM DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial : A prospective , randomize , assessor- blind , multicenter study safety efficacy combine treatment methotrexate glucocorticoid versus glucocorticoid alone patient polymyositis dermatomyositis Tested investigational medicinal product : Methotrexate ( Methotrexatum dinatricum 2,5 mg tbl. ) . Mechanism Action : Methotrexate inhibit dihydrofolic acid reductase . Dihydrofolates must reduce tetrahydrofolates enzyme utilized carrier one-carbon group synthesis purine nucleotide thymidylate . Therefore , methotrexate interferes DNA synthesis , repair , cellular replication . Actively proliferate tissue malignant cell , bone marrow , fetal cell , buccal intestinal mucosa , cell urinary bladder general sensitive effect methotrexate . Comparator : Prednison ( Prednisonum 20 mg tbl . ) Mechanism Action : Glucocorticoids naturally occur hormone prevent suppress inflammation immune response administer pharmacological dos . At molecular level , unbound glucocorticoid readily cross cell membrane bind high affinity specific cytoplasmic receptor . This bind induces response modify transcription , ultimately protein synthesis achieve steroid 's intend action . Such action may include : inhibition leukocyte infiltration site inflammation , interference function mediator inflammatory response , suppression humoral immune response . Some net effect include reduction edema scar tissue , well general suppression immune response . The degree clinical effect normally relate dose administer . The antiinflammatory action corticosteroid think involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory protein , collectively call lipocortins . Lipocortins , turn , control biosynthesis potent mediator inflammation prostaglandin leukotrienes inhibit release precursor molecule arachidonic acid . Likewise , numerous adverse effect relate corticosteroid use usually relate dose administer duration therapy . Number patient trial : - Total 50 - In centre : 10 Summary : The aim study determine safety efficacy add methotrexate ( MTX ) glucocorticoid ( GC ) compare glucocorticoid treatment alone patient inflammatory myopathy . 1 . PM DM usually treat glucocorticoid immunosuppressive drug . However , treatment yet study thoroughly properly evaluate randomize control trial . There controlled study PM/DM management perform small group patient . This first randomize control trial MTX 2 . This clinical trial ass efficacy MTX patient early PM/DM 3 .
