	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether S-1 combination Cisplatin effective 1st line therapy slow tumor activity patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . The study also look safety S-1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study S-1 Combination With Cisplatin 1st Line Therapy Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced non-small cell lung cancer relatively unresponsive chemotherapy . This true nucleoside analogue gemcitabine , response rate approximately 10 % , well 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Even gemcitabine combine chemotherapeutic drug biological agent , overall tumor response rate remain basically unchanged . S-1 new generation oral fluoropyrimidine combine Tegafur ( 5-fluoro-1- ( tetrahydro-2-furanyl ) -2,4 ( 1H,3H ) -pyrimidinedione [ FT ] ) , oral prodrug 5-FU , two modulators , Gimeracil ( 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine [ CDHP ] ) , inhibit 5-FU degradation dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) inhibition , Oteracil potassium ( Oxo ) , inhibit 5-FU phosphorylation digestive tract . This combination 3 compound design achieve enhance antitumor activity decrease gastrointestinal toxicity . This open-label , multicenter , single-arm , 3-stage , Phase 2 study evaluate efficacy safety S-1 combination cisplatin 1st line therapy patient advance NSCLC . The 3 stage study correspond run-in tolerability stage ( stage 1 ) , futility stage ( stage 2 ) , decision stage ( stage 3 ) . The run-in tolerability stage conduct assess additional toxicity associate frequent schedule administration cisplatin ( 75 mg/m2 every 3 week ) compare dose regimen establish prior Phase I study patient advance gastric cancer ( 75 mg/m2 every 4 week ) . The futility stage ( stage 2 ) conduct ensure treatment combination sufficiently efficacious expose sufficient number patient able make decision ( stage 3 ) whether combination treatment warrant evaluation future study .</detailed_description>
