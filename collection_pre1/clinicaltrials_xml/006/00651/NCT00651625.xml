	<brief_summary>The study design randomize study directly compare performance outcome syringe needle procedure standard syringe new reciprocate procedure device ( RDP ) , type safety syringe . Over 5 year period , 820 subject require assent syringe needle procedure usual customary care randomize either conventional syringe RPD one arm without ultrasound guidance . The RPD design safer , faster , less painful , effective patient , mechanic RPD intend provide physician good needle control , result less needle trauma patient tissue , thus , reduce bleed pain patient . This clinical trial address whether RPD indeed superior conventional syringe shot , injection , needle procedure , whether safer , less painful syringe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>* BACKGROUND The syringe ancient device design principally inject medication . However , inherent biomechanics human hand interaction hand piston , syringe stable easily control injection phase , extremely unstable difficult control aspiration phase . New reciprocate technology accommodates biomechanics hand function great promise improve stability safety hand-held device , include procedure syrinx . * EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS The study design randomize study directly compare performance outcome syringe needle procedure accomplish either standard syringe new reciprocate procedure device ( RDP ) . Over 5 year period , 820 subject require assent syringe procedure usual customary care randomize either conventional syringe reciprocate syringe . The following syringe procedure study : 1 ) local anesthesia , 2 ) centesis ( arthrocentesis , paracentesis , thoracentesis , amniocentesis , pericardiocentesis ) , 3 ) aspiration puncture ( aspiration bursa , cyst , abscess , shunt , bone marrow , syringe aspiration procedure ) , 4 ) injection therapeutic diagnostic substance joint , bursa , vessel , body structure , 5 ) fine needle biopsy syringe vacuum mass tissue , 6 ) irrigation procedure ( wound , bladder , irrigation procedure ) , 7 ) vascular access ( introduction wire , catheter , sheath blood vessel ) , 8 ) without ultrasound guidance . In subject multiple individual procedure site , require multiple separate biopsy , randomize two syrinx , biopsy fluid sample analyze separately ( medically appropriate ) . The physician perform syringe procedure physicians usually perform syringe procedure credentialed . Outcome data collection occur first one investigator observe procedure collect data real time interview chart review include cost analysis . Outcome data include effectiveness ( preprocedural pain , pain 2 week post procedure , pain 6 month postprocedure ) , procedure time , patient pain , operator satisfaction , trauma tissue , complication , diagnostic yield , overall medical care cost hospital stay . Retrospective review 30 chart device use clinically also approve ( 2006 ) . Analysis data perform statistician blind treatment group . *SIGNIFICANCE : The propose study first study clinical performance characteristic medical device incorporate new reciprocate technology design take advantage inherent biomechanical stability characteristic human hand . The preclinical study present preliminary data demonstrate markedly enhance device performance characteristic , much great control stability , strongly suggest reciprocate device safer , effective , economical , provide good patient outcome .</detailed_description>
