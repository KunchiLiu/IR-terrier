Furthermore , high fidelity simulation expensive widely available , compare NRP low fidelity team training NRP high fidelity team training . Our hypothesis : 1 . NRP low fidelity team training result ) good teamwork , b ) good quality care compare standard NRP . 2 . NRP high fidelity team training result well teamwork well quality care NRP low fidelity simulation . 3 . NRP high fidelity team training produce long lasting effect teamwork NRP low fidelity simulation .</brief_summary>
