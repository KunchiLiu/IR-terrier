	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , flutamide , bicalutamide , leuprolide , buserelin , goserelin , may lessen amount androgen make body . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give androgen suppression therapy together radiation therapy effective without docetaxel treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study androgen suppression therapy , radiation therapy , docetaxel see well work compare androgen suppression therapy radiation therapy treat patient high-risk localized prostate cancer . CLOSURE : This trial close accrual November 2009 . The study endpoint reach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Suppression Therapy Radiation Therapy With Without Docetaxel Treating Patients With High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare disease-free survival rate patient high-risk localized adenocarcinoma prostate treat androgen suppression therapy radiotherapy v without docetaxel . Secondary - To compare overall survival . - To compare time biochemical disease progression . - To compare time local disease progression . - To compare time distant disease progression . - To compare time next anticancer therapy . - To compare progression-free survival . - To compare degree prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) suppression prior radiotherapy . - To compare quality life ( QOL ) use EORTC QLQ C30 EORTC QLQ PR25 questionnaires trial-specific checklist . - To compare nature , severity , frequency adverse event . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Gleason score ( ≤ 7 v ≥ 8 ) , baseline prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ( &gt; 20 ng/mL v ≤ 20 ng/mL ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive androgen suppression therapy comprise oral flutamide three time daily oral bicalutamide daily 4 week AND leuprolide subcutaneously ( SC ) intramuscularly every 1-6 month , buserelin SC every 2 3 month , goserelin SC every 1 3 month 3 year . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment docetaxel repeat every 21 day 4 course . Beginning least 4 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo pelvic radiotherapy daily 5 day week 8 week . - Arm II : Patients receive androgen suppression therapy undergo pelvic radiotherapy arm I . Patients complete quality life questionnaire baseline , periodically treatment , every 6 month 5 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
