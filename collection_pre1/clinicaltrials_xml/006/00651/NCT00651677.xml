	<brief_title>Hand Assisted Versus `` Pure '' Laparoscopic Assisted Proctectomy Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared traditional open surgery , laparoscopic surgery colon cancer result short-term benefit less pain , short length stay , fast return bowel function maintain equivalent oncologic outcome . For reason , increase number colon cancer patient undergo laparoscopic surgery.1-3 Similarly , many potential benefit perform rectal surgery laparoscopically . Although well document , laparoscopic rectal surgery active study may result usual short-term benefit associate laparoscopic surgery . In addition , compare open surgery , laparoscopy provide unprecedented , unobstructed view rectal dissection plane even patient narrow pelvis , surgeon entire surgical team . Magnified view surgical plane allow precise sharp dissection . The pneumoperitoneum also help open plane mobilization mesorectum . Despite potential advantage , adoption laparoscopic rectal surgery limit many reason . Although several prospective randomize trial demonstrate safety benefit associate laparoscopic colon cancer surgery , benefit yet clearly demonstrate laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery.1-3 In addition , concern inadequate oncologic rectal dissection , anastomotic complication , technical challenge limit wide adaptation laparoscopic rectal surgery.4,5 In effort retain benefit laparoscopic surgery compromise oncologic rectal dissection , others advocate perform hybrid procedure colonic portion surgery perform use `` pure '' laparoscopic technique rectal dissection perform open limit low midline Pfannestiel ( low transverse ) incision.6 Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery technique surgeon place hand abdomen airtight access device perform laparoscopic surgery . By place hand abdomen laparoscopy , surgeon retain ability manually retract , expose , manually dissect , lost pure laparoscopic surgery . Retention abilities significantly expedite operation . In fact , several study demonstrate hand-assisted laparoscopic colon surgery result significantly shorter operative time less conversion open surgery maintain similar short-term outcome compare `` pure '' laparoscopic technique.7-9 In rectal surgery cancer , sigmoid colon , leave colon , splenic flexure need mobilize order allow tension free anastomosis colon residual rectum . In laparoscopic proctectomy , HALS compare SLS technique may therefore , result short operative time base colonic portion operation alone . One technical hurdle perform laparoscopic rectal dissection exposure retraction rectum . As one dissect distal rectum , especially patient narrow pelvis , crowd clash instrument result poor exposure dissection . The prospective randomize trial compare result open vs. laparoscopic surgery include rectal cancer CLASICC trial.3 It report increase circumferentially positive margin cancer follow laparoscopic rectal resection twice many patient laparoscopic group ( 12 % ) involve margin open group ( 6 % ) . This increase radial margin may relate difficulty retraction exposure . In HALS , rectal exposure dissection either perform directly incision use open technique laparoscopically manual assistance . This may result equivalent oncologic outcome open surgery shorter operative time compare SLS technique . A challenge laparoscopic rectal surgery localization tumor , less issue colon cancer tumor easily visible tattooed preoperatively . This possible rectal cancer , pose problem dissection safe division rectum . Without tactile sensation difficult sure stapler tumor . Hand assist laparoscopic surgery allow preservation tactile sensation therefore circumvent problem . The next step follow mobilization rectum division rectum anastomosis . This pose challenge laparoscopic surgeon several reason . The current laparoscopic stapling device angulate maximum 65 make horizontal division rectum difficult . Morin et al report leak rate 17 % 12 cm anal verge high 25 % divert follow laparoscopic rectal surgery.4 Leroy et al report similar leak rate 20 % cancer 15 cm follow laparoscopic rectal surgery.5 Comparatively high leak rate laparoscopic rectal surgery may relate limitation currently available laparoscopic surgical stapler . By perform distal rectal division incision use open surgical stapler , hand-assisted laparoscopic rectal surgery may result low anastomotic leakage rate . We hypothesize hand-assisted laparoscopy may result short operative time retain benefit associate laparoscopic surgery . In study , plan randomly assign patient diagnose rectal cancer undergo either `` standard '' laparoscopic surgery hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery . We compare peri-operative long-term outcome patient . If hypothesis true , hand assist laparoscopic approach rectal surgery may preferable standard laparoscopic surgery .</detailed_description>
