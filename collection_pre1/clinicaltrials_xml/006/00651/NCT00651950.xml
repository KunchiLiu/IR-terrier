	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis nurse doctor use transcutaneously power ultrasonic flow sensor make repeatable accurate hydrocephalic shunt flow measurement . The study participant align flowmeter probe flow sensor hidden thick saline pad simulate skin . A hidden pump provide know flow flow sensor participant make measurement . Each participant repeat measurement period week , data tell whether operator skill influence flow measurement accuracy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis transcutaneously power ultrasonic flow sensor hydrocephalic shunt repeatedly accurately read medical personnel range nurse senior neurosurgeon . The test involve prototype implantable hydrocephalic shunt flow sensor readout electronics . The readout electronics use pickup coil transcutaneously operate sensor coil align sensor 's inductive coupling coil . During test , shunt flow sensor hidden thick saline gel pad whose thickness approximate skin thickness old pediatric patient . A syringe pump provide know flow rate tube connect sensor , study participant know pump flow setting . Three neurosurgeon six floor nurse perform study . Each use Transonic flowmeter readout align pickup coil flowmeter hidden sensor make flow measurement . Each participant repeat measurement multiple time non-consecutive day . The record data quantify measurement accuracy repeatability different operator , determine whether operator skill influence flow measurement accuracy .</detailed_description>
