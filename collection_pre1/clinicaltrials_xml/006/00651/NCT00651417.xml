	<brief_summary>Participants diagnose localized prostate breast cancer schedule undergo external beam radiation therapy . Participants either receive placebo organic germanium take 5 time day start day first radiation continue 1 month follow-up visit . Weekly Quality life form complete one month follow visit 3 month follow visit . Labs do prior start treatment , end treatment one three month follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Organic Germanium Placebo Prevention Radiation Induced Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With increase public use complementary medicine , researcher agree compel need study safety efficacy agent human mean appropriately design double-blind , placebo control clinical trial . With fatigue affect 96 % cancer patient population little life style alteration offer intervention , need evaluate putative innovative approach fatigue high priority . The NIH release `` State Science '' statement 2002 conclude fatigue serious cause morbidity , prevalent symptom experience cancer patient . This expert panel also conclude major barrier effective management fatigue include lack awareness fact , lack knowledge cause fatigue , lack proven method treat fatigue . Presently , clinical trial evaluate intervention cancer fatigue lack . Organic germanium literature state may effective agent combat fatigue virtually toxicity . Since virtually cancer patient receive radiation therapy experience fatigue , use drug evaluate intervention non-anemic fatigue breast prostate cancer patient undergo definitive course radiation therapy . We intend test whether organic germanium able reduce fatigue experienced patient undergo radiation therapy reduction fatigue correlate improvement quality life patient . Changes patient ' mood also evaluate . We also collect information toxicity profile Organic germanium try determine peak fatigue time occur possibly recover . This information utilize see large study warrant . 2.0 OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary : To determine Organic germanium effective decreasing severity fatigue patient undergo definitive radiation therapy prostate breast cancer one month follow-up visit . 2.2 Secondary 2.2.1 To compare change patient ' mood Organic germanium versus placebo one month follow-up visit 2.2.2 To compare duration fatigue organic germanium placebo 2.2.3 To evaluate toxicity profile organic germanium use CTCAE version 3 scale . 2.2.4 To determine Peak time fatigue patient receive external beam radiotherapy high dose rate brachytherapy breast prostate cancer . 2.2.5 To determine tolerability 5 tablet per day dose schema . 2.2.6 To determine patient recover radiation induce fatigue</detailed_description>
