	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess antitumor effect wild-type reovirus ( Reolysin® ) , term tumor response rate clinical benefit rate ( i.e. , partial response complete response ) , patient metastatic melanoma . II . Assess toxicity profile Reolysin® patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess progression-free survival overall survival patient . II . Assess viral replication metastatic melanoma deposit intravenous administration Reolysin® . III . Assess impact pre-existing anti-reoviral immunity ( represent p38 expression pretreatment tumor specimen ) efficacy toxicity Reolysin® . IV . To measure effect Reolysin® immune system , term dendritic cell activation , T-cell activation , presence Treg cell tumor specimen , frequency T cell , B cell , NK cell , peptide specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive melanoma differentiation antigen peptide ( gp100 , MART-1 , tyrosinase ) . V. To assess induction melanoma specific immune response , term presence melanoma differentiation antigen ( gp100 , MART-1 , tyrosinase ) tumor specimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive wild-type reovirus ( Reolysin® ) IV 60 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient undergo tumor tissue sample collection baseline 1 week initiation treatment correlative laboratory study . Tissue sample analyze p38/MAPK activation status IHC ; reoviral replication metastatic deposit electron microscopy ; immunologic parameter IHC . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study . Blood sample analyze immunologic parameter tetramer ELISPOT technology neutralize antibody reovirus . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
