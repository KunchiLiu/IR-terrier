	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect ezetimibe coadministered simvastatin compare simvastatin alone administer 12 week endothelial function assess brachial artery reactivity test ( BART ) use high-frequency ultrasound image brachial artery vasomotor response flow-mediated stimulus ( high-shear stress ) subject high cholesterol . The secondary objective include evaluation nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation . In addition , lipid parameter ( low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [ LDL-C ] , high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [ HDL-C ] , triglycerides [ TG ] , total cholesterol [ TC ] ) C reactive protein ( CRP ) assess treatment group .</brief_summary>
