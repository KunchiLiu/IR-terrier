	<detailed_description>In first phase project , convene series focus group , whose member convenience sample ( n = 53 ) select veteran Boston VAMC . These group use set forth formal definition PTSD-related functional impairment variable , create item pool , refine pool emphasis standard content validity , content relevance content breadth . Using psychometrics call rational method instrument construction ( Edwards , 1970 ; Hulin , Drasgow , &amp; Parsons , 1983 ; Nunnally , 1978 ) , first step carefully delineate complete clearly express write definition PTSD-related dimension function quality life . Another important source information veterans various conflict military-related PTSD four focus group session . The intent pose series structure question aim elicit group member ' functional impairment quality life issue relate PTSD . Next , table specification ( Aiken , 1994 ) employ aid orderly construction item across content area . In regard , functional impairment dimension , separate aspect definition identify , item write systematically represent aspect . The end result step initial pool 30 35 item construct . Consistent classic psychometric guideline ( e.g. , Nunnally , 1978 ) , number item adequate produce individual scale 15 20 item , , turn ( rational approach describe faithfully follow ) , sufficient number exhibit acceptable psychometric characteristic . Phase 2 objective select best final set item measure identify dimension PTSD-related functional impairment well assess criterion-related validity . Using empirically derive item scale characteristic , trim item pool arrive small , higher-quality , parsimonious set . For scale , content relevance content breadth , line formal definition factor , maintain . Data collection additional instrumentation . The test development sample select accordance sample plan . Two hundred eighty six consent veteran Boston VAMC participate interview , last approximately two hour . Eighty-five percent participant male 15 % female . We aim collect data veteran meet criterion current PTSD ( one-third sample ) well meet criterion lifetime current PTSD ( one-third sample ) traumatize meet criterion current lifetime PTSD ( PTSD ; one-third sample ) . Further , collect data diverse sample veteran , representation Vietnam , Persian Gulf , OEF/OIF conflict . Historical/demographic information obtain interview well chart review concern follow variable : age , race , socioeconomic status , current annual income , employment , education , marital status . In addition , historical data regard illegal behavior , suicide attempt , psychiatric hospitalization , prescription medication , interpersonal conflict , service connection disability status collect . We also obtain pertinent information veteran ' DD-214 , include declaration combat theatre duty , military occupational specialty , combat medal award . PTSD diagnosis assess use Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale DSM-IV ( CAPS ) . The CAPS design improve reliability validity PTSD assessment . Since development , CAPS become gold standard arrive PTSD diagnosis , either current lifetime , use 200 published study . Functional impairment assess use several establish measure . The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey-veterans version ( SF-36V ; Ware &amp; Sherbourne , 1992 ) provide eight domain score index physical functioning , physical role , bodily pain , general health , vitality , social functioning , emotional role , mental health ; addition , summary physical mental health score may compute . The reliability validity SF-36 well document ( e.g. , McHorney , Ware , &amp; Raczek , 1993 ) . The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II ( WHODAS II ) measure functional disability assess wide-range impairment disability dimension use multi-item scale include pain , concentration , understand communicating , mobility , self care , family burden , get along others , household work activity work loss , participation society ( Appendix A : WHODAS ) . The WHODAS-II become widely use investigation functional disability across wide-ranging population , include physically ill ( i.e . rheumatology , pulmonary , primary care cohort ) severely mentally ill ( schizophrenic cohort ) . Although patient PTSD relate anxiety disorder include original multi-center development instrument , WHODAS-II employ specifically trauma survivor . For study , use 36-item self-report version scale . Scores 6 individual domain , well overall score global functional disability calculate . The Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) standard method represent clinician 's judgment patient 's overall level psychosocial functioning . As , probably single widely use method assess impairment among patient psychiatric substance use disorder . The GAF require clinician make overall judgment patient 's current psychological , social , occupational functioning . In DSM-IV-TR , rating make scale 1 100 , rating 1 10 indicating severe impairment rating 91 100 indicate superior functioning . GAF rating impairment modestly associate index social functioning , extent social network need support , residential instability , lack employment , poor work adjustment . In general , however , relationship relatively weak ; GAF rating tend closely associate diagnosis psychiatric symptom social occupational functioning . General life satisfaction , define `` individual 's evaluation degree important need , goal , wish fulfil '' ( Frisch , Cornell , Villanueva , &amp; Retzlaff , 1992 , p. 93 ) measure use Quality Life Inventory ( Frisch , 1992 ) , 16-item instrument employ Likert-type response format produce weight summative score across multiple facet life satisfaction ( e.g. , standard living , work , home , relationships relative ) . The psychometric quality measure strong , high test-retest internal consistency reliability strong validity coefficient clinical community sample , include veteran . To assess malingering , participant complete M-FAST ( Miller , 1995 ) . The M-FAST brief 25-item screening interview individual age 18 year old provide preliminary information regard probability he/she feign psychiatric illness . Most malingering symptom validity instrument assess malinger cognitive and/or neuropsychological deficit . The M-FAST focus exclusively malinger psychiatric illness include Depression , Schizophrenia , Hypervigilance , Personality Disorder , Nightmares , Suggestibility Interview . Analytic procedure interpretation . Classical test theory-oriented item characteristic compute ( Aiken , 1994 ; Anastasi , 1982 ; Nunnally , 1978 ) . For item accompany multipoint Likert-type response format ( `` strongly disagree '' `` strongly agree '' ) , frequency distribution descriptive statistic first calculate . Items symmetric response distribution prefer item skew distribution . Finally , correct item-total correlation , correlation item 's score sum score item measure construct , compute , appropriate construct . Item-total correlation index item 's ability distinguish among high low attribute thus indicative item 's precision measurement . Items high item-total correlation typically take precedence low item-total correlation . Using judgment content validity , distributional endorsement pattern statistic , item-total correlation , final set item construct choose . Estimates internal consistency reliability ( Cronbach 's alpha ) calculate . At close Phase 2 , product refine inventory PTSD-related functional impairment . Phase 3 involves collection data second-stage test sample support cross validation criterion-related validity . Refined measure previously identify dimension PTSD-related functional impairment , along measure PTSD health outcome administer active duty sample another veteran sample . Data collection additional instrumentation . Seventy-five percent participant male 25 % female . Participants administer refine shortened version inventory well scale intend assess physical mental health , health-related quality life , functional impairment , social desirability . Data collection expect last 60-75 minute participant . With exception CAPS MFAST , measure use Phase 2 employ Phase 3 . In place CAPS , use PTSD Checklist ( PCL ; Weathers et al. , 1993 ) ass PTSD symptom . The PCL good sensitivity specificity positively correlated standard measure PTSD . In place MFAST , SIMS . Analytic procedure interpretation . Data test validation phase offer second opportunity compute internal consistency reliability ( Cronbach 's alpha ) measure functional impairment . It important re-estimate reexamine internal consistency fresh sample since estimate derive sample item select ( Phase 2 ) take advantage sample-specific covariation may somewhat inflate . It also critical cross-validate initial finding independent sample order ensure item comprise develop functional impairment scale optimal .</detailed_description>
