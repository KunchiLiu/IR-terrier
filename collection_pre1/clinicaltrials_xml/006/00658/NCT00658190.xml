	<detailed_description>This clinical study use automate screen capability FocalPoint Primary Screening System ( BD ) gynecologic cytology specimen ( Pap test ) allow automated field view ( FOV ) selection , digital image capture , subsequent Internet-based transmission custom design computer-based image reading station . The system utilizes liquid-based cytology preparation ( ThinPrep , SurePath ) . In system , skilled cytology human resource necessary scan site , expertise centralize . Pilot study show task feasible clinically relevant standard care . Phase 1 trial preselected seeded specimen confirm clinical standard . The phase 2 trial extend concept prospectively enrolled population patient 2 site ( Walter Reed , Mass General ) thereby test concept population normal disease prevalence . The final phase 3 large study intend use design , sit screen device 121st Army Hospital Korea interpret specimen image US . In addition reading specimen , system design give immediate `` loop closing '' result back specimen 's originate point immediate upon completion test .</detailed_description>
