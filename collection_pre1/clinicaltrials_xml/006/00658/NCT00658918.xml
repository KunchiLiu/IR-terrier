	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate safety three dose level ciclesonide administer intranasal spray six week , 200µg , 100µg 25µg , daily , pediatric patient ( age 2-5 year ) PAR . The secondary objective measure serum concentration ciclesonide active metabolite steady state condition three time point correspond presumed peak trough exposure six week administration . In addition , reflective ( 24-hour ) total nasal symptom score ( TNSS ) six week treatment various timepoints physician assessment nasal symptom endpoint summarize .</brief_summary>
