	<brief_summary>Background/rationale : Ertapenem innovative antimicrobial agent , approve European Union diabetic foot infection skin soft tissue . Although antimicrobial spectrum activity ESBL-strains promising treat infect ulcer associate diabetes , lack data tissue pharmacokinetics ertapenem patient population . However , antimicrobial efficacy important show antibiotic achieves sufficient concentration site infection , i.e . tissue . A recent clinical study Burkhardt et al . ( Journal Antimicrobial Chemotherapy , 2006 ) use microdialysis technique show free tissue concentration single dose 1 g ertapenem sufficient adequate kill relevant bacteria , suggest efficacy ertapenem soft tissue infection . It well know accumulation ertapenem plasma multiple dose 1 g every 24 h patient without significantly impaired renal function . The single dose study Burkhardt et al . also suggest negligible drug accumulation expect soft tissue healthy young volunteer multiple dos . However , show antibiotic tissue PK may significantly different pathologic condition , lead impaired penetration , subsequent accumulation multiple dos due long tissue half life healthy volunteer . Since property inflame tissue may diverge healthy tissue important evaluate concentration ertapenem reach inflamed tissue multiple dos . Clinical study : In present study measure concentration ertapenem time plasma infect tissue 10 diabetes patient multiple dos . The microdialysis technique use . The ertapenem concentration measure inflamed tissue non-inflamed subcutaneous tissue identify effect inflammation pharmacokinetics . The finding present study help confirm efficacy ertapenem indication diabetic soft tissue infection .</brief_summary>
