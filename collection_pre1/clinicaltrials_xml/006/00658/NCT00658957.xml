	<brief_title>Prevention Infection Using Topical Gentamicin-Collagen Sponge Diabetic Patients With An Uninfected Foot Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infected skin ulcer diabetes debilitate difficult heal . Diabetic ulcer responsible frequent health care visit , major predictor amputation . Diabetic ulcer cause patient 's inability sense pain warmth well peripheral vascular disease , cause diminished blood flow foot . Early aggressive treatment necessary prevent infection ultimately prevent need amputation . Gentamicin antibiotic effective treat certain kind infection . Collagen protein find mammal . The gentamicin-collagen sponge thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain gentamicin . When applied open ulcer , collagen break gentamicin release ulcer , little absorbed blood stream . The high level gentamicin open infect ulcer may help treat infection . In study , subject give necessary supply teach take care foot ulcer . Subjects randomly assign receive either gentamicin-collagen sponge plain collagen sponge . The sponge apply ulcer twice week treatment period .</detailed_description>
