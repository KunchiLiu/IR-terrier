	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect give azacitidine together gemtuzumab ozogamicin see well work treat old patient previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Azacitidine may also stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , gemtuzumab ozogamicin , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving azacitidine together gemtuzumab ozogamicin may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test whether outcome patient age 60 old previously untreated non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia treat azacitidine plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin sufficient warrant phase III investigation . II . To estimate frequency severity toxicity regimen good- poor-risk group patient . III . To investigate preliminary manner disease-free survival patient achieve complete remission receive post-remission therapy study . IV . To investigate preliminary manner cytogenetic response rate patient treated regimen . V. To investigate preliminary manner effect cytogenetic abnormality , promoter global methylation change , multidrug resistance overall survival response azacitidine plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord risk status ( good [ 60-69 year age OR Zubrod performance status [ PS ] 0-1 ] v poor [ &gt; = 70 year age AND Zubrod PS 2-3 ] ) . REMISSION INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive azacitidine intravenously ( IV ) 10-40 minute subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV 2 hour day 8 . Patients residual leukemia ( blast count &gt; = 5 % ) receive second course induction therapy begin day 15-29 . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) morphologic complete remission incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) go receive consolidation therapy . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive one course azacitidine gemtuzumab ozogamicin induction therapy ( azacitidine give SC ) . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive azacitidine SC day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy cytogenetic study baseline , remission , relapse progression ( completion treatment correspond one time point ) . Marrow blood sample submit correlative study submit Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) /chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) Repository Seattle , WA . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month 2 year , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
