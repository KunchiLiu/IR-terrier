This pilot study eight-week , open-label clinical antidepressant treatment trial use Cymbalta ( duloxetine hydrochloride ) dose 20mg 60mg daily patient co-morbid depression bereavement . Twenty ( 20 ) patient sustained loss first-degree relative ( spouse , child , parent , sibling ) within past two year AND meet criterion major depressive episode time screen recruit participation study . Patients tolerate respond Cymbalta treatment offer maintenance therapy Cymbalta one year effective dose . We expect Cymbalta treatment associate substantial remission response rate , measure HRSD-17 score . Similarly , expect substantial mean reduction measure grief bereavement , improvement measure pain , symptom burden , functional status .</detailed_description>
