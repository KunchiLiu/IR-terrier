	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study use On Board Imager kilovoltage ( OBI KV ) system cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) scan CT-on-rail system look well routine device call electronic portal image device ( EPID ) set patient receive radiation therapy lymph node neck .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Setup Variation Supraclavicular Lymph Nodes Treatment Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Imaging Techniques Radiation Treatment Planning : The standard way set patient receive radiation therapy lymph node neck use EPID , use high-energy X-rays make image see patient 's body position radiation therapy correct . It important doctor see position patient 's low neck radiation deliver right place . The position patient 's body radiation therapy typically check week use EPID similar device . While patient lie treatment table , EPID system take necessary image . In study , along use EPID , researcher use OBI KV system CBCT scanning , order look well standard EPID describe patient 's neck position . OBI KV imaging design make image use low-energy X-rays , image consider reasonably clear easy doctor read . CBCT scan us low-energy X-rays let doctor see lymph node low neck . Unlike regular CT scanning , CBCT scan require `` contrast '' material use . Since 3 piece equipment ( EPID , OBI KV , CBCT system ) build treatment machine , need move extra piece equipment use study . You lay still , usual , image take row . Screening Tests : The study doctor review medical chart decide eligible take part study . If find eligible agree take part , begin normal radiation treatment planning process . You sign separate consent form describe radiation therapy EPID procedure detail , well risk . During treatment period receive radiation treatment day 5 week , CBCT scan OBI KV image perform week . Before receive radiation treatment , lie treatment table , EPID use . After , OBI KV CBCT device rotate around take image study . During radiation therapy treatment , EPID , OBI KV , CBCT scan perform week , day possible . Sometimes EPID OBI KV scan perform treatment , CBCT scan may perform another treatment week . It take 30 minute finish take OBI KV CBCT image . The result CBCT scan OBI KV imaging , way , use plan radiation therapy . Length Study Participation : After 5-week radiation treatment period , participation study . This investigational study . The EPID commercially available FDA approve use set patient receive radiation therapy . OBI KV image CBCT scan also commercially available FDA approve use purpose , typically use . What experimental study use additional procedure ( OBI KV image CBCT scan ) check reliably EPID set patient receive radiation therapy lymph node neck . Up 30 evaluable patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
