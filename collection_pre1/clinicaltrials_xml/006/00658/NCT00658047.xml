	<brief_title>A Study Assess CH1504 Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) chronic inflammatory disease unknown cause lead pain , stiffness , swell limitation joint function . If leave untreated , RA produce serious destruction joint frequently lead permanent disability . Methotrexate ( MTX ) currently commonly prescribe first-line disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) early onset action , good efficacy , ease administration . In addition , MTX combine FDA approve DMARDs , include gold compound , sulfasalazine , hydroxychloroquine , TNF inhibitor , anakinra leflunomide . However , administration MTX associate serious side effect skin reaction , pneumonitis , gastrointestinal disturbance include diarrhea , ulcerative stomatitis hemorrhagic enteritis , hepatotoxicity renal toxicity . Overall estimate 30 % patient discontinue MTX therapy due side effect . MTX enters cell via Reduced Folate Carrier ( RFC ) system . Once inside cell , convert enzymatically polyglutamylated derivative . These metabolite readily effluxed retained tissue . The accumulation polyglutamyl metabolites MTX prolong period may play significant role efficacy toxicity compound . Methotrexate parent form activity dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) . In order significant activity enzyme ( i.e . Thymidylate Synthase ( TS ) ) must polyglutamylated . However polyglutamylated MTX metabolite retain cell may potentiate cytotoxicity MTX . In addition polyglutamylation metabolism , MTX also hydroxylated liver metabolite know 7-hydroxymethotrexate , also subject polyglutamylation cell retention . This metabolite implicate liver kidney toxicity parent compound , contribute role efficacy . CH-1504 show vitro nonpolyglutamylatable nonhydroxylatable antifolate efficiently take cell reduced folate carrier ( RFC ) system MTX . CH-1504 significant activity DHFR TS enzymes without need polyglutamylation . The lack hydroxylation potentially lead enhanced level active drug cell . Furthermore , glutamyl moiety susceptible cleaved carboxypeptidase . Thus CH-1504 may refer metabolically stable antifolate . It hypothesis clinical set CH-1504 demonstrate efficacy classical antifolates ( via folate enzyme inhibition ) devoid toxicity secondary formation polyglutamylated hydroxylated metabolite , provide significantly improve therapeutic index compare classical antifolates , MTX . This study randomize , double-blind , methotrexate control study ass clinical effect CH-1504 patient active rheumatoid arthritis determine proportion patient achieve ACR20 response 12 week treatment . Secondary objective : - Assess clinical efficacy CH-1504 proportion patient achieve ACR50 ACR70 response . - Assess clinical efficacy CH-1504 use EULAR `` good '' `` moderate '' response criterion . - Assess clinical efficacy CH-1504 use difference baseline ACR core set DAS28 measure . - Evaluate safety tolerability CH-1504 RA patient determine frequency severity adverse event , laboratory abnormality , dropout . - Identify dose response relationship CH-1504</detailed_description>
