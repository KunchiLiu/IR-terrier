	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , single arm , dose-ranging , clinical study . Panitumumab administer intravenous infusion 4-6 patient per cohort . Three plan cohort , stratify age , study 100 % recommend panitumumab dose treatment schedule define adult . Enrollment start 2.5 mg/kg weekly administration 12 &lt; 18 year old patient . Upon demonstration sufficient safety additional cohort open ; 2.5 mg/kg weekly administration 1 &lt; 12 year old patient 6.0 mg/kg every two week 12 &lt; 18 year old patient . The decision advance next cohort base observance ≤ 33 % incidence dose limit toxicity evaluation period . Subsequent cohort 6.0 mg/kg every two week 1 &lt; 12 year old patient 9.0 mg/kg every three week age group open sufficient safety cohort determine . Participants may stay study treatment disease progression .</detailed_description>
