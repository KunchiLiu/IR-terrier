	<brief_summary>It suggest therapeutic effect repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) mediate change cortical inhibition ( CI ) . However , healthy subject effect rTMS CI inconsistent . The aim study explore different rTMS - stimulus condition neurophysiological molecular mechanism human motor cortex . Fifty-six healthy subject randomize three different treatment group receive 1 active sham rTMS session ( 6000 rTMS pulse ) 90 % motor threshold ( MT ) . Cortical inhibition index pre post treatment use short-interval intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) , cortical silent period ( CSP ) long-interval cortical inhibition ( LICI ) . Based previous study hypothesize : - Hypothesis 1 : rTMS result great CI ( i.e. , prolong CSP , increase LICI SICI ) compare sham rTMS . - Hypothesis 2 : 20 Hz rTMS result significantly great CI compare 1 Hz rTMS . - Hypothesis 3 : There distinctive transcription profile associate increase CI rTMS detect whole-genome microarray analysis peripheral leukocyte .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It demonstrate several neurologic psychiatry disorder associate dysfunctional cortical inhibitory mechanism alteration neurotrophins ( biological marker involve neuronal survival plasticity ) rTMS therapeutic effect associate change cortical excitability . CI produce rTMS demonstrate SICI , CSP LICI . However remain unclear rTMS parameter induce best CI . Exploring different rTMS stimulus condition versus sham condition effect CI human motor cortex way identify best rTMS therapeutic parameter . Also , evaluate molecular effect produce rTMS treatment serum blood level help identify mechanisms rTMS exerts therapeutic effect ultimately clarify mechanisms treatment effect mediate . This experiment intend demonstrate best rTMS parameter acquire high CI . If hypothesis correct , parameter help obtain high therapeutic effect , consequently , improvement rTMS treatment .</detailed_description>
