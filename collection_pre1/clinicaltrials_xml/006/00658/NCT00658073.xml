	<brief_title>Induction Therapy With Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Kidney Allografts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal transplantation common successful type organ transplantation . Induction therapy antibody plus maintenance immunosuppressive agent greatly improve graft survival renal transplantation . Since mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) use successfully treat graft versus host disease show immune modulation function vitro vivo may help repair damage tissue ( ) , evaluate autologous MSCs alternative antibody induction therapy . Moreover , examine MSCs could improve recovery early function transplant kidney .</detailed_description>
