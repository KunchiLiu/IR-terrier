	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether gemcitabine effective give together without capecitabine treat patient biliary cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give gemcitabine together capecitabine see well work compare give gemcitabine alone treat patient locally advance , unresectable , metastatic biliary cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Without Capecitabine Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Metastatic Biliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare overall survival ( OS ) rate patient locally advance , unresectable metastatic biliary tree cancer treat combined gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine vs. gemcitabine hydrochloride alone . Secondary - To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient group . - To compare response rate ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) patient group . - To compare stable disease ( SD ) rate patient group . - To compare rate disease control ( CR , PR SD ) patient group . - To estimate compare response duration patient group . - To compare effect treatment measure quality life patient group use EORTC QLQ-C30 . - To compare nature , severity frequency toxicity two arm . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumour type ( cholangiocarcinoma vs. gallbladder biliary unknown ) , ECOG performance status ( 0-1 vs. 2 ) , extent disease ( locally advance vs. metastatic ) , treatment center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( Gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 8 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( Gemcitabine hydrochloride alone ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess 12 week randomization 4 week completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
