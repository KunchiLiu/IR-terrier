	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study side effect best dose monoclonal antibody treat patient stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety/toxicity single dose B7-dendritic cell cross-linking antibody contain plasma treat patient stage IV melanoma . Secondary - Describe immunological change ( Th1/Th2 balance , frequency tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes , plasma cytokine profile ) treat patient . - Determine treatment impact tumor growth ( e.g. , objective response , time progression ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive B7-dendritic cell cross-linking antibody IV day 1 . Patients undergo peripheral blood collection baseline periodically infusion analysis dendritic cell activation , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity , immune cell impact , serum cytokine change use immunophenotyping flow cytometry . After completion study treatment patient follow every 2 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
