	<brief_summary>Betathalassemia major disease blood bone marrow . You bear make unable make normal hemoglobin red cell . You receive red blood cell transfusion life . These transfusion cure disease . The problem transfusion contain lot iron . With time iron build body eventually hurt organ . Because buildup iron , take medicine help body get rid extra iron . Today , treatment bone marrow stem cell transplant . It do match donor available . This often brother , sister , parent . Bone marrow transplant may cure betathalassemia major . If transplant successful , long disease . Without matched sibling parent , standard treatment keep transfusion . In near future , test new treatment make normal hemoglobin normal red blood cell . We recreate healthy hemoglobin gene test tube . We able use put back cell . This call gene therapy . We able put gene stem cell mice thalassemia . These mouse cure . We plan take gene put stem cell people betathalassemia major . We inject stem cell back person 's blood . In general , obtain stem cell blood person bone marrow . In order , must give person blood growth factor . The growth factor stimulate bone marrow make stem cell . That growth factor call granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) , Filgrastim . The purpose trial find drug GCSF side effect , make stem cell response . This trial gene therapy trial . This trial help thalassemia .</brief_summary>
