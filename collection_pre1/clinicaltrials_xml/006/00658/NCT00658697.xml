	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Bevacizumab Androgen Deprivation Therapy After Definitive Local Therapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single arm phase 2 study design evaluate rate patient free Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) progression ( TTP ) one year complete ADT men BCR definitive local therapy prostate cancer . The null alternative TTP rate 41 % 60 % respectively . A sample size 42 would provide 80 % power detect difference 2-sided type I error rate 0.05 . ' The primary objective evaluate proportion patient free PSA progression complete one year ADT The secondary objective include 1 . PSA response ( &lt; 0.2 ng/mL &lt; 0.01 ) completion docetaxel/bevacizumab , completion ADT one year ADT 2 . Correlation PSA response TTP 3 . Toxicity 4 . Testosterone recovery 6 , 12 month ADT Treatment schedule detail follow : - Each treatment cycle last three week . During first three month , participant receive Avastin docetaxel day 1 three-week cycle total four dos docetaxel/Avastin . Avastin docetaxel administer intravenously . The Avastin continue give every three week docetaxel complete total 17 dos ( one year ) Avastin therapy . - Participants receive zoladex ( lupron ) day 1 first cycle every 3 month total 18 month . Zoladex administer subcutaneously Lupron administer intramuscularly . - Bicalutamide pill start completion docetaxel chemotherapy ( start month 4 ) take daily hormone therapy complete ( total 15 month ) . - During treatment cycle , participant physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might experience . Blood work perform every three week first three month every three month hormone therapy follow-up . - After final treatment participant follow-up visit every three month first two year , every 4 month third year every 6 month year 4 5 .</detailed_description>
