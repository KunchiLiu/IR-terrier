	<detailed_description>Erlotinib register patient affected NSCLC second subsequent line small benefit Overall Survival . Recent evidence suggest patient EGFR mutation clear benefit treat EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor , role drug wild-type EGFR patient , represent large majority ( 85-90 % ) , still unclear properly plan trial assess issue . Recently , indirect evidence subgroup analyse randomized trial suggest chemotherapy might superior erlotinib wild-type EGFR patient . Moreover , several author recommend use EGFR determine immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) FISH reproducibly predict outcome . For reason protocol amend May 2011 superiority trial docetaxel versus erlotinib , first version aim assess interaction biomarkers .</detailed_description>
