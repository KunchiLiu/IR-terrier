	<detailed_description>This randomise , placebo-controlled , double-blind study primarily assess local systemic safety tolerability CN54gp140 vaccine . We also assess whether CN54gp140 vaccine effective inducing systemic and/or local specific immune response . Thirty healthy woman volunteer enrol study , 2 clinical site . Twenty receive active CN54gp140 vaccine , 10 receive placebo . The placebo group help u identify side effect cause CN54gp140 . The study double-blind eliminate possibility researcher subject bias . Before administration , CN54gp140 placebo mix aqueous gel vehicle . The treatment administer intravaginally regimen 9 immunisation 3 week . Each immunisation CN54gp140 vaccine contain 100 µg CN54gp140 protein , mean total dose 900 µg give subject active treatment group . Subjects require make total 15 outpatient visit local clinical site , 4 successive menstrual cycle . Menstrual cycle 1 : Screening visit There 2 screen visit , 4 2 week first immunisation . During visit volunteer ask question health history give permission u contact General Practitioner . Blood urine sample take routine laboratory safety test , test HIV hepatitis , sexual health , pregnancy . Blood also collect immunology test establish pre-immunisation state immune system . The volunteer also cervico-vaginal examination , sample cervico-vaginal secretion cell do immunology test . A photograph cervix take help identify change might occur trial . Also , full medical history examination do . The volunteer give diary card take home . They 'll ask record diary symptom , medication take , course trial . The diary regularly check trial staff , also make symptom enquiry visit . Menstrual cycle 2 : Immunisation visit There 9 immunisation visit , successive Mondays , Wednesdays Fridays . The 1st visit 7 day start menses . At 1st , 4th 9th immunisation visit , blood urine collect routine laboratory safety pregnancy test , blood collect immunology test . Subjects also cervico-vaginal examination , temperature , blood pressure heart rate measure , self-administering vaccine . At rest immunisation visit , subject self-administer vaccine . No procedure do . Menstrual cycle 3 : Sampling visit There 3 sample visit , 9 , 14 21 day start menses . At visit , subject cervico-vaginal examination , sample secretion cell do immunology test . Also , blood collect immunology test , subject temperature , blood pressure heart rate measure . At 1st 3rd sample visit , blood urine collect routine laboratory safety test also . Menstrual cycle 4 : End-of-study visit This visit 10 day start menses . Blood urine collect routine laboratory safety pregnancy test , test HIV , immunology test .
