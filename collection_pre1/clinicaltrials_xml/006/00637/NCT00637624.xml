	<brief_title>N-AcetylCysteine v . Placebo Prevent Neurotoxicity Induced Platinum Containing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background study : Cisplatin ( CDDP ) major compound chemotherapy patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) malignant mesothelioma . Cisplatin associated number side-effects , one neurotoxicity . For number patient neurotoxicity dose-limiting side-effect . At point measure take prevent occurrence neurotoxicity treatment cisplatin . Recent study show association anti-oxidants treatment cisplatin neuroprotective effect without loss anti-tumour efficacy cisplatin . One anti-oxidants glutathione ( GSH ) , natural anti-oxidant synthesized cell , mainly liver muscle . This GSH play central role pathophysiology ( efficacy side-effects ) cisplatin . We want investigate efficacy N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , serve substrate synthesis GSH , prevention cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity . Objective study : - The primary objective establish neuroprotective efficacy NAC cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity . Mainly sensory neuronal guidance assess treatment cisplatin group patient receive NAC compare control-group receive placebo . If peripheral neuropathy ca n't measure , neuropathy assess ototoxicity measure audiogram . - The secondary objective establish protective effect NAC regard cisplatin-induced side-effects haematological pathology ( anaemia , leucopenia , thrombopenia , febrile neutropenia ) , loss creatinine clearance occurrence liver-chemistry abnormality . Secondary objective include also establish effect tumour response , clinical performance ( Karnofsky performance index ) quality life . Study design : Monocenter , non-academical teaching hospital , double-blind randomize placebo-controlled study . Study population : 50 Consecutive patient , receive least 4 cycle cisplatin treatment NSCLC , SCLC malignant mesothelioma , admit , irrespective disease stage . Intervention : Patients randomize placebo-arm NAC-arm . They receive study-medication ( NAC placebo ) intravenously every 3 week , time 6 hour completion cisplatin-infusion . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : - Burdens : Patients undergo three electromyographic ( EMG ) test , normally take place course whole treatment , therefore patient visit hospital measure . To minimize burden , EMG-measurements plan day , patient visit hospital reason regard his/her regular chemotherapy-treatment . Only surface patch electrode use ( needle electrode ) . All information obtain patient ' file ( blood sample , physic evaluation , etc ) consider part routine treatment . When EMG 's measure , audiogram use , audiogram also part routine treatment , consider extra burden . Patients fill Quality Life questionnaire . - Risks : NAC well know drug , use thirty year , well tolerate . For intravenous NAC , allergic reaction report . There also theoretical risk , NAC may reduce anti-tumour efficacy cisplatin , risk theoretically rule appropriate dosing NAC . After inclusion first 30 patient interim analysis perform regard tumour response . - Benefits : NAC possibly prevent occurrence neurotoxicity , improve quality life . This may , turn , result less probability dose-reductions preterm arrest treatment .</detailed_description>
