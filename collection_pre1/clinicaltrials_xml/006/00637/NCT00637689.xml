	<brief_title>Improving Outcomes Assessment Chronic GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) one devastate long-term complication infusion allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell , remain one major barrier successful transplantation . Relatively little progress make understand improve treatment chronic GVHD last 20 year , survival rate diagnosis chronic GVHD barely improve despite advance supportive care . The National Institutes Health convene Consensus Conference topic June 2004 recently publish recommendation improve research method series six paper . In study , establish multi-center , observational , longitudinal cohort order improve outcome assessment chronic GVHD specific aim ( 1 ) validate prognostic factor risk stratification ; ( 2 ) define significant variable chronic GVHD activity index predict short-term ( provider perception change , patient perception change , change immunosuppressive medication ) longer-term outcome ( overall survival , time discontinuation systemic immunosuppressive therapy , functional impairment ) . This goal accomplish assemble large modern cohort people chronic GVHD four large core transplant center . Approximately 700 people ( half prevalent case , half incident case ) chronic GVHD enrol . Every 3-6 month collect objective subjective measure reflect disease activity , response therapy , detailed physician assessment organ involvement , patient self-assessments symptom , functional status , quality life . Data use test publish hypotheses new recommendation emanate NIH Consensus conference . We also able provide detail data need understand modern trend chronic GVHD incidence , manifestation , response treatment . These study need operationalize recommendation NIH Consensus conference , advance understanding chronic GVHD , enhance ability conduct clinical trial .</detailed_description>

If patient receive topical local therapy diagnosis , subsequently require systemic treatment , may enrol upon initiation systemic therapy . ( Note , patient classify incident prevalent case depend time chronic GVHD diagnosis , start systemic therapy ) If prevalent case ( define enrollment three month chronic GVHD diagnosis ) , subject must within 2 year stem cell infusion If incident case ( enrollment le 3 month chronic GVHD diagnosis ) limitation time transplantation No evidence primary disease relapseProgressionfree malignancy enrollment ( evidence primary disease progression since transplant , although residual disease may still present ) Evaluation transplant center time study enrollment Signed , inform consent applicable , child assent Inability comply study procedure Anticipated survival le 6 month due comorbid disease</criteria>
