	<brief_summary>This open-label , randomised phase III , multicentre , Italian study design investigate role trastuzumab patient locally advance and/or metastatic breast cancer express HER2 receive first line chemotherapy contain trastuzumab . The trial divide two study : 1 . The maintenance study conduct patient progress first line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab . 2 . The 2nd line study conduct patient progress first line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project consist two independent , follow specific eligibility criterion different randomisation scheme study , later call maintenance study 2nd line study . All patient enrol maintenance study , disease progression screen enter 2nd line study . Maintenance study : Open-label , randomise , phase III , multicenter , Italian study design investigate role maintenance therapy trastuzumab patient locally advance and/or metastatic breast cancer express HER2 progress first line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab . Patients ed : Arm A : maintenance trastuzumab treatment Arm B : interruption trastuzumab treatment ratio 2 maintenance trastuzumab : 1 interruption trastuzumab . Trastuzumab administer intravenously every 3 week progression disease , unmanageable toxicity patient refusal . Patients evaluated progression every 9 week ( correspond time required complete evaluation every 3 trastuzumab infusion ) . For patient whose disease progress two year enrolment , treatment continue accord physician decision disease assessment make follow routine clinical practice . Follow-up continue achievement require number event . 2nd line study : Open-label , randomise , phase III , multicentre , Italian study design investigate role second line therapy trastuzumab patient locally advance and/or metastatic breast cancer express HER2 progress first line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab . Patients randomise : Arm A : trastuzumab + chemotherapy treatment Arm B : chemotherapy alone ratio 1 trastuzumab + chemotherapy treatment : 1 chemotherapy alone . Trastuzumab administer intravenously , concomitant second line chemotherapy physician 's choice . Trastuzumab give weekly 3-weekly schedule accomplish schedule concomitant chemotherapy , progression disease , unmanageable toxicity patient refusal . Patients evaluated progression every 9 week ( correspond time required complete evaluation every 3 trastuzumab infusion ) . Follow-up continue achievement require number event . In maintenance study , trastuzumab give outpatient set every 3 week dose 6 mg/Kg intravenous infusion 90 minute , 30 minute Investigator 's discretion follow 30 minute observation time . If last previous dose trastuzumab give 4 week enter study , patient receive re-loading dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg 90 minute , follow 30 minute observation time . Therapy trastuzumab continue progression disease , unmanageable toxicity patient refusal . For patient whose disease progress two year enrolment , treatment continue accord physician decision disease assessment make follow routine clinical practice . In 2nd line study , accomplish schedule concomitant second line chemotherapy , trastuzumab give weekly ( 2 mg/kg ) 3-weekly ( 6 mg/kg ) basis modality maintenance study , accord clinician 's decision . Concomitant second line chemotherapy leave physician 's choice . If last previous dose trastuzumab give 4 week enter study , patient receive re-loading dose trastuzumab 4 mg/kg 60 minute , follow 30 minute observation time .</detailed_description>
