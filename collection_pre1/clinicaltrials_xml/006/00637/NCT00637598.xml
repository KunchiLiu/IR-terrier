	<brief_title>Early Detection Breast Cancer Using Tomosynthesis Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Finding breast cancer early show improve chance survival . Mammography ( x-ray imaging breast ) help find breast cancer early . Some breast cancer , however , see mammography , create two-dimensional image radiologist see . The goal study make breast tomosynthesis tomosynthesis 3D ( three-dimensional ) x-ray system take x-ray image many angle . This similar CAT ( computerize axial tomography ) scan breast give radiologist 3D information find breast cancer might otherwise hide view .</detailed_description>
