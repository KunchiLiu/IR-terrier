CT , MRI , xrays , etc. ) . Unresponsive conservative care period least 6 week Neck Disability Index score ≥ 15/50 ( 30 % ) Willing able comply requirement protocol include followup requirement sign study specific informed consent More 1 level require surgical treatment intractable cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy . Active local ( propose surgical site ) systemic infection Prior anterior neck surgery level . Prior posterior cervical spine surgery index level except posterior decompressive surgery posterior element preserve . Currently undergo treatment disease thoracic lumbar spine . Axial neck pain primary diagnosis , without evidence neural compression Significant cervical anatomical deformity Any anatomical consideration investigator opinion would make anterior cervical approach excessively risky impossible Severe obesity define Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 40 Instability AP , lateral neutral flex/ext image : ≥2mm translation relative adjacent segment , and/or ≥ 11 degree relative adjacent segment Central disc height ≤ 2mm Advanced spondylosis ( i.e . facet joint degeneration , anterior posterior bridge interspace lack motion preoperative flexion/extension xrays ) Severe cervical myelopathy indicate : Signs and/or symptom &gt; 6months duration , Nurick 's Classification grade IV V , and/or Myelomalacia evidence MRI Metabolic bone disease osteoporosis degree spinal instrumentation contraindicate ( Males 55 year age , females 50 year age and/or subject investigator opinion medical indicative osteoporosis ( e.g . early menopause , steroid use , etc . ) require DEXA scan ; If DEXA scan ≤ 2.5t spine , patient must exclude ) Allergy component device ( titanium , polycarbonated polyurethane , polyethylene terephthalate , ethylene oxide residual ) Chronic steroid medication use may interfere bony/soft tissue heal History endocrine metabolic disorder ( e.g . Paget 's disease ) know effect bone mineral metabolism Autoimmune diseases e.g. , ankylose spondylitis , rheumatoid arthritis , etc . Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Active malignancy Currently pregnant consider become pregnant followup period Advanced emphysema , Alzheimer 's disease medical condition would interfere patient selfassessment function , pain quality life Medical condition ( e.g . unstable cardiac disease , endstage cancer ) may result patient death prior study completion Chemical dependency ( e.g . alcohol narcotic addiction ) problem may interfere study requirement Mental incompetence determine Investigator may effect participation study Incarcerated Involved current pending litigation relate spinal condition Concurrently participate investigational study Anatomy ( e.g . endplate dimension ) index level consistent dimension implant available ( e.g . base preoperative radiographic evaluation templates surgical technique manual ) .</criteria>
