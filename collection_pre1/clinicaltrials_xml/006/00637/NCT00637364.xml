	<brief_summary>This open-label , non-randomized , single-center , therapeutic trial patient AJCC Stage III IV pancreatic cancer tumor relate abdominal and/or back pain evaluate safety high intensity focus ultrasound therapy use FEP-BY02 HIFU system palliation pancreatic cancer-related pain . Patients meet eligibility criterion without exclusion criterion offer opportunity participate study . After obtain informed consent baseline history , physical examination , laboratory study , additional imaging study need perform . The major theoretic risk patient procedure development acute pancreatitis . If acute pancreatitis develop , become clinically evident day 3 follow HIFU ablation . Therefore , initial phase pilot study design allow sufficient interval HIFU treatment identify whether theoretic risk manifest clinically . Previous clinical experience China suggest HIFU pancreatic tumor safe without risk develop severe acute pancreatitis . Patients treat HIFU approximately 15-20 % tumor volume treat per session . The first 5 patient ( feasibility study ) receive first HIFU treatment follow 3-5 day interval observation . Following feasibility study result review FDA . If serious adverse event encounter , FDA agree continue study , next 5 patient treated interval 2-3 day treatment . If serious adverse event encounter group , next group 5 patient treated interval 1-2 day treatment .</brief_summary>
