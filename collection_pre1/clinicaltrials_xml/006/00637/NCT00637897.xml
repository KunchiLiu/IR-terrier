	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , docetaxel , , paclitaxel , ixabepilone work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Paricalcitol may help chemotherapy drug kill tumor cell make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study best dose best way give paricalcitol see well work give together chemotherapy treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paricalcitol Chemotherapy Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine ability administer 8 continuous week therapy within first 3 month enrollment paricalcitol give together taxane ixabepilone therapy woman metastatic breast cancer . - To estimate proportion patient successfully complete 8 continuous week therapy well proportion patient achieve 'steady-state ' dose . Secondary - To determine dose paricalcitol take continuously maintain normal calcium level combine taxane ixabepilone . - To determine baseline level 25-hydroxycholecalciferol parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) associate time treatment failure patient . - To determine PTH level decline baseline patient treat paricalcitol combination taxane ixabepilone therapy . OUTLINE : Beginning day 1 , patient receive oral paricalcitol . The dose paricalcitol increase every 2 week serum calcium level 9 mg/dL 11.4 mg/dL . Once level reach , patient continue dose duration study . Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , docetaxel , paclitaxel week every 3 week ixabepilone every 3 week . Treatment continue least 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
