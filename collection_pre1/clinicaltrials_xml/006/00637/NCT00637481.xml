	<brief_title>A Phase I Prevention Study Atorvastatin Women Increased Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine minimum biological effective dose ( MBED ) atorvastatin require induce modulation proliferation marker , Ki-67 , breast tissue woman high risk develop breast cancer . We evaluate pre- post atorvastatin treatment ( 4 dose level ) expression Ki-67 sample obtain via FNA breast tissue woman high risk breast cancer . This specific aim test hypothesis treatment atorvastatin induce decrease Ki-67 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate atorvastatin induced modulation breast cancer biomarkers marker ( EGFR , P-EGFR , ER , p21 , p27 , bcl-2 , CC3 , cytology ) drug relate marker ( LXR , total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , CRP ) woman high risk develop breast cancer . II . To determine plasma tissue level atorvastatin two hydroxylated metabolite ( ohydroxyatorvastatin p-hydroxyatorvastatin ) woman treat atorvastatin correlate level Ki-67 level . III . To correlate change Ki-67 above-described panel biomarkers HMG-CoA reductase genotype . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 4 arm . ARM I : Participants receive oral atorvastatin daily 3 month . ARM II : Participants receive oral atorvastatin ( high dose arm I ) daily 3 month . ARM III : Participants receive oral atorvastatin ( high dose arm II ) daily 3 month . ARM IV : Participants receive treatment . Participants undergo blood sample collection fine needle aspiration breast tissue baseline 3 month correlative biomarker study .</detailed_description>
