Valproic acid show inconsistent effect schizophrenia significant effect recent control study . Although still controversially discuss , carbamazepine find offer beneficial effect treatment schizophrenia . Nonetheless , data effect limit small sample size poor design respective study . Furthermore , complex pharmacological interaction new atypical neuroleptic carbamazepine underline necessity alternative strategy adjuvant treatment schizophrenia well combine treatment bipolar disorder mood stabilizer neuroleptic . Oxcarbazepine ( OXC ) new anticonvulsant drug act pro-drug 10-monohydroxy metabolite ( MHD ) , active metabolite also carbamazepine suggest responsible therapeutic action . Therefore , pharmacological action OXC well comparable carbamazepine whilst few unwanted side effect OXC regard eg . skin rush , effect blood compound cardiotropic effect . The effect OXC cytochrome CYP3A4 CYP3A5 moderate UDPGT slightly affect OXC , lead less interaction compound pharmacokinetical level . In psychiatry , study publish report positive effect OXC bipolar disorder . With regard clinical observation , OXC show potential beneficial effect adjunct treatment schizophrenia well require evaluation control study design .</brief_summary>
