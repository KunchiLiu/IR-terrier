	<brief_summary>Study Question : In infant born gestational age 23 0/7 27 6/7 week , lower concentration supplemental oxygen target arterial oxygen saturation pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) 85-89 % compare 91-95 % , day birth baby 's first discharge home , increase probability survival without severe neurosensory disability correct age 18 month ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Canadian Oxygen Trial ( COT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most extremely preterm baby require supplemental oxygen several week even month birth . The goal oxygen therapy achieve adequate oxygen delivery tissue without cause oxygen toxicity oxidative stress . At present , goal elusive immature infant . Although standard practice modern neonatal intensive care unit monitor arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry , insufficient evidence guide choice upper low alarm limit . A rigorous trial long-term follow urgently need long overdue determine whether oxygen exposure reduce safely extremely preterm infant without increase risk hypoxic death disability .</detailed_description>
