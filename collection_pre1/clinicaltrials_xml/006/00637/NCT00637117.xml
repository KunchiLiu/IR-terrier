	<brief_title>Intratumoral Dendritic Cell Vaccination Combined With Local Radiotherapy Patients With Recurrent Lymphoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphoma extremely sensitive radiation commonly use therapy . The major issue application local radiotherapy relative short duration response consequence use mainly palliation . Therefore novel therapy need improve outcome patient lymphomas . The potential specificity immune system recognize eliminate tumor cell especially relevant lymphoma . Immune response induce , coordinate regulate dendritic cell ( DCs ) , potent antigen-presenting cell . Based central role DCs initiate immune response , four vaccination administer interval begin two day low dose radiation give tumor site .</detailed_description>
