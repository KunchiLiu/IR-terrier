	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer grow without recruit new blood vessel . Studies human identify novel cell population , term vascular leukocyte ( VLCs ) . While VLCs cancer cell , support growth ovarian cancer cell stimulate growth new blood vessel provide cancer nutrient . VLCs make protein term CD52 . An antibody therapeutic , Alemtuzumab ( also know Campath ) , kill cell make CD52 protein successfully use treat certain lymphoma ( type blood cell cancer ) make CD52 protein . The purpose study determine Alemtuzumab give subcutaneously ( skin ) safely give patient ovarian , fallopian , primary peritoneal cancer kill VLCs determine Alemtuzumab , eliminate VLCs , restrict tumor growth increase response rate chemotherapy give discontinuation chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
