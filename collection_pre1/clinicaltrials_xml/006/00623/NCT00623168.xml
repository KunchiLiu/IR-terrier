	<detailed_description>Hemorrhagic Fever Renal Syndrome ( HFRS ) cause virus genus Hantavirus family Bunyaviridae . There four known Hantavirus cause HFRS : Hantaan , Seoul , Puumala Dobrava virus . HFRS acquire contact chronically infected rodent host , commonly inhalation infect rodent excreta . Hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome characterize clinically triad fever , hemorrhage renal insufficiency . HFRS typically consist five consecutive frequently overlap clinical phase : febrile , hypotensive , oliguric , diuretic convalescent . DoD operation result deployment personnel Europe Southeast Asia , area endemic HFRS , viral hemorrhagic fever . Early initiation therapy intravenous Ribavirin show effective treatment HFRS . It therefore important initiate therapy base clinical diagnosis consistent viral hemorrhagic fever epidemiological history risk exposure hantavirus . Ribavirin nucleoside ( guanosine ) analog activity wide variety ribonucleic acid deoxyribonucleic acid virus . Mechanism action fully define . The mechanism may relate alteration cellular nucleotide pool viral messenger RNA formation , recent data suggest mechanism Ribavirin HFRS may serve RNA virus mutagen result `` extinction catastrophe '' error , result incorporation viral RNA genome . Ribavirin license United States aerosol form treatment severe low respiratory tract infection child oral formulation combination recombinant interferon alpha treatment chronic hepatitis C infection . The intravenous formulation ribavirin license United States . IV Ribavirin treatment HFRS use IND 16,666 . This Phase 2 , open-label study safety IV Ribavirin treatment individual Hemorrhagic Fever Renal Syndrome ( HFRS ) admit 121st Combat Support Hospital , Seoul , Republic Korea . The study also monitor morbidity mortality subject HFRS treat IV Ribavirin . The study population include subject probable suspected clinical diagnosis HFRS , least 18 year age ( age 17 active military ) great 65 year age . The Investigators intend treat individual present tentative diagnosis HFRS ( within 7 day onset illness ) meet entry criterion 7 day course IV Ribavirin 28-60 day follow period first dose Ribavirin . In addition treatment Ribavirin , subject give standard supportive symptomatic care determine clinical judgment attend physician consultant manage subject 's care 121 CSH . Up 50 subject could potentially enrol five year time period expect accrual 0-5 subject per year , number may higher ( 10 20 person year ) HFRS outbreak occur . Specific inclusion/exclusion/relative exclusion criterion part protocol . Safety procedure require 7 day treatment include continuous cardiac monitoring , daily lab work , physical exam vital sign .</detailed_description>

Men agree intercourse pregnant woman 7 month receive Ribavirin , take precaution avoid produce pregnancy 7 month receive Ribavirin . Have hemoglobin great equal to10 g/dL start IV Ribavirin . A known intolerance Ribavirin . Are irreversibly ill presentation , define presence profound shock , respond supportive therapy within 3 hour admission . A positive pregnancy test . An estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/minute . A history hemoglobinopathy ( i.e. , sicklecell anemia thalassemia major ) . A history autoimmune hepatitis . A hemoglobin less 10 g/dL correct â‰¥10 g/dL initiation IV Ribavirin . A New York Heart Association Cardiac functional capacity Class II great ASHD CHF . Known cardiac conduction defect may predispose subject arrhythmia , second third degree heart block sick sinus syndrome ( pacemaker ) , WolfeParkinsonWhite Syndrome . A sinus bradycardia le 40 beat per minute ( sinus bradycardia le 50 beat per minute individual know low rest heart rate relate physical conditioning ) . Concurrent therapy Didanosine ( ddI ) . DdI must discontinue start IV Ribavirin . Relative PI 's discretion use IND Ribavirin caution . The PI make decision concern enrollment subject relative exclusion criterion base risk versus benefit drug . Creatinine clearance 20 30 mL/minute History gout tophaceous gout On drug may decrease heart rate ( betablockers , calcium channel blocker , digoxin IV Ribavirin avoid severe renal insufficiency , use creatinine clearance 20 30 mL/min base risk versus benefit . If use , drug discontinue creatinine clearance decrease 20 mL/min low .</criteria>
