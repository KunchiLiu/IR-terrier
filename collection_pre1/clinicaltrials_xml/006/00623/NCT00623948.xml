	<detailed_description>Within scope study aim : ( 1 . Develop pre-implantation assessment protocol utilizing target CT locate optimal gluteal motor point bilaterally . ) CT assessment pelvic region spinal cord injure subject carry determine regional vascular nervous anatomy . This allow u achieve optimal electrode placement use minimally invasive implantation procedure . ( 2 . Develop implanted gluteal stimulation system . ) The fully implanted gluteal stimulation ( GSTIM ) system envision marriage establish technology implant IM electrode develop Cleveland FES Center newly develop Micropulse I 2-channel stimulator . The Micropulse I IPG small , rechargeable stimulator develop NDI Medical platform technology neuromodulation neurostimulation application . The device customize order provide two synchronized channel stimulation GSTIM system . ( 3 . Implement evaluate implant gluteal stimulation system human volunteer . ) A pilot clinical trial fully implant gluteal stimulation system carry use two-arm crossover study ten wheelchair user risk pressure ulcer development due impaired mobility . Pre-defined selection criterion employ screen potential participant physically psychologically . All participant receive stimulation system consist implanted IM electrode insert bilaterally gluteus maximus together Micropulse I stimulator implanted subcutaneously low abdomen . Tissue health assess three month interval 12-month period follow implantation . The clinical application system great relevance veteran population risk pressure ulcer development . The project add value continue improvement health care provision veteran , allow benefit recent advance medical device technology . Although initial target user group veterans SCI , propose system application patient population risk due reduce mobility , multiple sclerosis elderly .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Motor sensory complete SCI high level T12 . Eligible subject open skin problem hospitalization three month prior entrance study . Additional exclusion criterion relate clinical factor suitability include : 1 . Age le 18 year . 2 . Less two year postinjury loss independent walk ability . 3 . More three urinary tract infection previous year . 4 . Significant active systemic disease , e.g . heart disease , renal failure , compromise renal function , diabetes . 5 . Abnormal nutritional status base albumin total protein level recruitment ( 3.0 albumin , 6.0 total protein ) . 6 . Osteomyelitis pelvic regional , indicate positive pelvic inlet xray routine annual urologic examination bone scan . 7 . Previous surgery perineal region radically alters basic anatomy , particularly regional innervation blood supply. , e.g. , amputation , hemipelvectomy .</criteria>
