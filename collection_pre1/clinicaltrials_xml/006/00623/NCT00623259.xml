Stable HAART regard immunologic clinical parameter least 6 consecutive month prior study entry ( substitution one drug another class due reason virologic failure allow ) . Plasma HIV RNA level &lt; 50 copies/ml least 6 month prior study entry ; single blip 400 HIV1 RNA copies/ml acceptable resolve spontaneously without change HAART . Plasma HIV1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/ml study entry . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hour prior immunization . Women childbearing potential must use acceptable method contraception 30 day prior first immunization , must agree use acceptable method contraception study , must become pregnant least 28 day last immunization . A woman consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal surgically sterilize .

Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Adequate renal function define : 1 . Calculated Creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; 50 mL/min estimate CockroftGault equation . 2 . Urine protein &lt; = 100 mg/dL none trace proteinuria ( urinalysis dip stick ( &lt; = 2+ proteinuria ) ) . Adequate hepatic function define : 1 . Total bilirubin &lt; = 2 x ULN unless elevation explain antiviral therapy absence evidence significant liver disease ( healthy subject without clinical disease Gilbert 's Syndrome include ) . 2 . AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) alkaline phosphatase &lt; = 3 x ULN without clinically significant finding . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) without abnormal finding ( e.g . kind atrioventricular intraventricular condition block complete left right bundle branch block , AVnode block , QTc PR prolongation , premature atrial contraction atrial arrhythmia , sustain ventricular arrhythmia , two premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ) row , ST elevation consistent ischemia ) . Negative test hepatitis B surface Antigen ( HBsAg ) hepatitis C antibody ( HCV Ab ) . Free obvious health problem establish medical history physical examination enter study . Signed informed consent form subject information risk benefit study language subject clearly understands , study specific procedure . Availability followup plan duration study . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Uncontrolled serious infection i.e . respond antimicrobial therapy . History serious medical condition , opinion investigator would compromise safety subject . History suspect active autoimmune disease . Persons vitiligo thyroid disease take thyroid replacement therapy exclude . History chronic alcohol abuse ( 40g / day least 6 month ) and/or intravenous drug abuse ( within past 6 month ) . History malignancy , squamous cell basal cell skin cancer , unless surgical excision consider achieved cure . Subjects history skin cancer vaccination site exclude . Manifestation clinically significant severe haematological , pulmonary , central nervous , cardiovascular gastrointestinal disorder . Clinically significant mental disorder adequately control medical treatment . Any condition might interfere study objective would limit subject 's ability complete study compliant opinion investigator .

Known allergy egg aminoglycoside ( gentamicin ) . History anaphylaxis severe allergic reaction . Having receive vaccination plan vaccination live vaccine within 30 day prior study vaccination . Having receive vaccination plan vaccination kill vaccine within14 day prior study vaccination . Chronic administration ( defined 14 day ) systemic immunosuppressant drug period start six month prior administration vaccine end study conclusion . ( Corticosteroid nasal spray permissible . Persons use topical inhaled steroid enrol therapy complete ) . Post organ transplant subject whether receive chronic immunosuppressive therapy . Any continuous therapy may influence CD4 count antiretroviral therapy . Administration plan administration immunoglobulin and/or blood product period start 3 month prior administration vaccine end study conclusion . Use investigational nonregistered drug vaccine study vaccine within 30 day 7 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study vaccine , plan administration drug study period . Previous participation another HIV vaccination study . Previous participation MVA vaccination study last 5 year .</criteria>
