	<brief_summary>This study , conduct National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Walter Reed Army Medical Center ( WRAMC ) , explore phenomenon phantom limb pain ( continued feeling pain amputate limb ) use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) investigate effect mirror therapy phantom limb pain . Right-handed people 18 75 year age WRAMC Military Amputee Research Program healthy control subject may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Amputees - Questionnaires assess strength handedness footedness pain perception . - Mirror therapy phantom limb pain five time week 4 week 15-minute session . - MRI fMRI scan start mirror therapy , 2 week therapy 4 week therapy . MRI use magnetic field radio wave image brain tissue . The subject lie table slide scanner ( metal cylinder ) . The structural MRI scan last 30 minute . For fMRI , subject performs task scanner order show change brain activity involve perform task . Subjects show picture foot body part , ask move foot , receive tactile ( touch ) stimulation foot body part . Control Subjects One group control subject undergoes single fMRI procedure . A second group control subject undergoes sequence three fMRIs time period amputee subject . None control subject undergo mirror therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The aim study investigate phantom limb pain ( PLP ) , cortical reorganization modulation PLP visual input . Mirror therapy ( view intact limb mirror appear miss limb ) show reduce PLP . This reduction demonstrate vision play key role modulate PLP . The study propose identify brain region critical success therapy use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Study population : Individuals unilateral amputation individual limb least three episode PLP week . Additionally , study amputee without PLP healthy control volunteer subject limb amputation . Design : Amputee subject PLP scan use fMRI undergo mirror therapy PLP . During fMRI scan subject see image hand foot , move limbs experience tactile stimulation . Mirror therapy require four week effective . Amputee subject scan prior start therapy , two week start mirror therapy four week mirror therapy . Mirror therapy session conduct daily subject also complete daily questionnaire ( Visual Analogue Scale , VAS , Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire SF-MPQ ) assess level pain number PLP episodes . Amputees without PLP one group healthy control subject go series functional image scan time period amputee subject , allow u identify brain change may associate repeat scanning ( e.g . due practice task ) rather result mirror therapy . Another group control subject scan identify particular brain region might involve integration visual , motor somatosensory information use analysis amputee subject data . Outcome measure : Changes fMRI activation course mirror therapy compare data number episode PLP , average length episode , average intensity pain assess use VAS SF-MPQ . Analyses focus cortical region know involved visual , tactile motor representation ( include primary motor cortex , primary secondary somatosensory cortex region visual cortex selectively responsive view body part ) . Additional brain region might involve integrate visual , motor somatosensory information identify control subject . Direct comparison make cortical region ( e.g . somatosensory region ) involve representation amputate limb compare intact limb amputee subject data control subject data .</detailed_description>
