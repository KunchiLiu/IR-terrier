	<brief_summary>This study conduct randomize , double blind , control trial . The control group receive albuterol deliver nebulizer along placebo treatment deliver meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) spacer +/- mask . The experimental group receive albuterol deliver MDI spacer +/- mask along placebo treatment give nebulizer . Parents , participant , study personnel , nurse staff , respiratory therapist know treatment assignment participant . The primary outcome change time asthma severity score , Clinical Asthma Score ( CAS ) ( Parkin et al . 1996 ) . The secondary outcome total number albuterol treatment receive hospital , time take give treatment , time till subject ' albuterol treatment give four hour interval , cost two type treatment . The study hypothesis albuterol deliver meter dose inhaler spacer non-inferior albuterol deliver nebulizer treatment child hospitalize moderate severe asthma exacerbation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies look use beta-2-agonists give MDIs spacer mask child great 2 year describe few side effect medication give nebulizer . Patients less tachycardia , vomit , oxygen desaturation ( Kerem et al . 1993 , Chou , Cunningham Crain 1995 , Lin Hsieh 1995 , Pendergast et al . 1989 , Fuglsang Pedersen 1986 ) . In emergency department setting , Rubilar et . al find albuterol deliver MDI spacer mask equal efficacy albuterol deliver nebulizer treat acute wheeze child le 2 year age . ( Rubilar , Castro-Rodriguez Girardi 2000 ) Chou et . al find child great 2 year old acute asthma exacerbation , MDIs efficacy nebulizer shorter delivery time few side effect . ( Chou et al . 1995 ) All child meet criterion participant study approach possible study enrollment ED . No outside recruit do . Once consent obtain patient enrol , randomize either albuterol MDI placebo nebulizer treatment albuterol nebulizer placebo MDI treatment . Subjects randomize one two treatment arm 1:1 randomization process . This do use prepared assignment log develop use random number generator . Children control arm receive albuterol via nebulizer placebo MDI spacer +/- mask . Children experimental arm receive albuterol MDI placebo nebulizer . All MDI treatment give spacer +/- mask . Subjects receive 6 puff &lt; 30 kg 10 puff &gt; 30 kg . If control group , puff placebo . If experimental group , puff albuterol ( 90 microgram per puff ) . For nebulizer treatment , patient control group receive 2.5 mg albuterol ( &lt; 30 kg ) 5 mg albuterol ( 30 kg great ) 3 ml normal saline . Patients experimental group receive nebulizer treatment 3 ml normal saline . Nebulized treatment deliver room air unless subject oxygen . All study medication administer clinical nursing staff respiratory therapist . The frequency albuterol give determine subject 's primary medical team . For subject , MDI treatment give first follow nebulizer treatment . Nursing staff record Clinical Asthma Score ( CAS ) ( Parkin et . al 1996 ) admission every 4 hour hospitalization 72 hour discharge ( whichever come first ) . Nursing staff also record total number albuterol treatment give time require give treatment . Patients ' total length stay calculate . A cost analysis do determine difference cost hospital two delivery device . This analysis include cost albuterol delivery device labor cost related nursing respiratory therapist ' time administer medication . Information subject ' baseline level asthma severity also collect begin study . All study patient give prednisolone , prednisone solumedrol dose 1 mg/kg/dose twice day total 5 day . The length steroid treatment extend beyond 5 day felt clinically indicate subject 's attending physician . Controller medication long act beta-2-agonists , inhaled corticosteroid , leukotriene inhibitor give discretion subject 's patient attending . All controller medication use hospitalization record part study data .</detailed_description>
