	<brief_summary>We hypothesize aberrant crypt focus ( ACF ) precursor colon cancer ; prevention would correlate cancer risk elimination would reduce risk . In study wish ( 1 ) establish feasibility stain-enhanced magnification colonoscopy , ( 2 ) determine whether colorectal cancer asociated increased number ACF , ( 3 ) investigate natural history ACF durability elimination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects randomly assign time stain-enhanced magnification colonoscopy ACF remove merely observe . Subjects evenly divide without personal history colon cancer . ACF tabulate observer blind subject 's personal history . All subject re-evaluated one year observer blind original procedure .</detailed_description>
