	<detailed_description>The purpose study demonstrate safety , tolerability , efficacy pharmacokinetics aplindore 5 group 8 patient early stage Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) base Modified Hoehn Yahr 1-3 , currently take dopamine agonist able wash dopamine agonists 14 day prior baseline . Of 8 patient cohort , 6 randomize receive aplindore two receive placebo . The initial cohort patient study unit day -1 day 15 ( ~2 week ) . After review safety labs ECGs Day -1 , patient begin twice day dose investigational product Day 1 dose give within 30 minute complete breakfast dinner , approximately 0700 1900 . A full UPDRS evaluation conduct screen day -1 , 7 14 . In addition part 3 UPDRS ( Motor ) collect daily 2 hour morning dose aplindore/placebo . At screen discharge patient ask self rate level sleepiness standardize rating scale ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) level nausea daily 2 hour time morning dose aplindore/placebo . Safety endpoint include adverse event ( AEs ) , clinical laboratory data , vital sign ( blood pressure , orthostatic blood pressure heart rate ) , ECGs , physical examination self rat scale . This study Phase II , dose-ranging , multi-center , placebo-controlled , double-blind , titration study determine safety , tolerability , efficacy pharmacokinetics aplindore 5 group 8 patient early stage Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) base Modified Hoehn Yahr 1-3 , currently take dopamine agonist able wash dopamine agonists 14 day prior baseline . Of 8 patient cohort , 6 randomize receive aplindore two receive placebo . The minimum number patient required initiate cohort 6 patient ( 4 randomize aplindore 2 placebo ) . The patient cohort randomize block 4 . Each site recruit full cohort 6-8 patient per dose-titration regimen . There share cohorts/dose regimen across site . Early PD patient screen 6-8 eligible patient house study unit day -1 day 15 dismiss investigator . After repeat safety lab ECG , patient begin q12h dose investigational product ( IP ) dose give within 30 minute complete breakfast dinner , approximately 0700 1900 start Day 1 . Doses escalate accord predefined schedule . Two hour morning dose , UPDRS part III perform . Safety ascertain adverse event , ECGs , orthostatic vitals , physical neurological exam , safety lab , Epworth Sleepiness Scale Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaires . One blood sample PK take escalation day , 11 sample steady state . ECGs vital sign ( semi-reclined standing ) collect day 2 hour post morning dosing . Adverse event collect throughout inpatient stay . Patients titrate upon reach intolerable dose . Patients prior dopaminergic medication resume prior therapy Day 15 . Those patient prior dopaminergic medication titrate 5-7 day research clinic . Outpatient safety follow 7-21 day last dose study medication .</detailed_description>
