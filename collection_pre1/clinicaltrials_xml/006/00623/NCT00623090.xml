	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer ( PCa ) lead cancer diagnosis among men second lead cause male cancer death . However , screen asymptomatic men remain controversial , early diagnosis treatment PCa yet demonstrate reduced disease-related mortality randomize trial . The goal current study develop ass widely accessible method assist men make informed decision PCa screening . We compare efficacy new web-based , interactive decision support approach exist print-based PCa screen decision tool , among diverse sample male primary care patient . Abundant evidence document expand role Internet increase access understand health information need systematic evaluation Internet-based intervention . A novel aspect propose trial focus cognitive bias factor limit success previous information-based intervention . Specifically , evaluate : 1 ) confirmation bias 2 ) short-term consequence bias .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Phase I ( month 1-8 ) five-year project , develop interactive , Internet-based , patient information decision aid . In Phase II ( month 9-60 ) , evaluate impact decision aid randomize controlled trial male primary care patient age 45-70 three Washington , District Columbia area health care setting ( N = 1875 ) . Trial arm include : 1 ) print-based information decision aid ( Print ) , 2 ) web-based information plus interactive decision aid ( Web ) , 3 ) usual care ( UC ) . Subjects complete outcome assessment baseline , one- 13-months post-baseline . The specific aim : 1 . Evaluate impact delivery method ( Web vs. Print vs. Usual Care ) key patient outcome variable knowledge , decisional satisfaction , screen decision . 2 . Identify factor moderate intervention ' impact primary outcome . 3 . Identify mechanisms intervention impact knowledge decisional satisfaction . In exploratory analysis , evaluate factor relate use web print material . This research potential make several significant innovative contribution : 1 ) development evaluation widely accessible method educate heterogeneous group patient controversial topic , adapt similarly contentious issue , 2 ) determination whether Web base material feasible method patient education age cohort , compare print material , 3 ) understand cognitive factor may hinder comprehension controversial medical decision , 4 ) determination among target population benefit web-based intervention , 5 ) information require streamline target future web-based educational intervention .</detailed_description>
