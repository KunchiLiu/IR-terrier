	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Long-term anticoagulant treatment adjust dos vitamin K antagonists highly effective prevent recurrent event first episode unprovoked Venous ThromboEmbolism ( VTE ) , even optimal duration therapy still uncertain . Since risk recurrency great first year initial thrombotic episode gradually diminish thereafter , benefit extend course anticoagulant treatment may offset time persist risk clinically important bleeding . A potential clinically relevant approach establish optimal duration Oral AntCoagulant Therapy ( OAT ) predict individual risk thrombotic recurrency index Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) . Although current scheme establish duration OAT base nature index DVT ( idiopathic provoke ) , new data start select parameter optimize decision . Recently , use D-dimer proven effective select OAC duration ; however , investigation evaluate patient idiopathic DVT , moreover , use D-dimer easily handle Institutions . In earlier prospective study conduct patient symptomatic DVT , presence residual thrombus associate increase risk thrombotic recurrencies either idiopathic provoke venous thrombosis . Interestingly , recurrent event occur previously affect vein also sit , thus suggest Residual Vein Thrombosis ( RVT ) may express pro-thrombotic status . Based finding , detection RVT may , therefore , help establish duration anticoagulation . Recently , conduct randomize , prospective , follow-up study patient first episode symptomatic DVT treat OAT 3 month OAT duration base upon RVT finding . In patient without RVT , risk recurrent DVT low even treatment stop 3 month . To confirm preliminary data enforce safety withhold OAT 3 month patient without RVT , conduct prospective study patient idiopathic DVT low limb . METHODS Study patient . Patients first episode document unprovoked provoke proximal DVT eligible study complete least three month OAT ( target INR 2.5 , range 2.0-3.0 ) . Unprovoked DVTs define thrombotic episode occur apparently healthy individual . Patients active cancer , limited life expectancy , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , know thrombophilic status ( antithrombin deficiency ) , serious liver disease , live far center exclude study . The study approve institutional review board participate center . All enrol patient provide write informed consent . Study Design . This multicenter prospective study patient first episode symptomatic proximal DVT detect Compression UltraSonography ( C-US ) receive OAT [ warfarin ( Coumadin , Bristol Myers Squibb ) 3 month . At time , subject agree participate physical examination ass baseline clinical condition exclude contraindication . C-US proximal deep vein system legs perform , measure diameter detectable thrombus Common Femoral Vein ( CFV ) Popliteal Veins ( PV ) . Images obtain transverse section . Lumen compressibility evaluate CFV PV gentle pressure probe , previously describe . Briefly , major minor diameter vein segment measure recorded compression . C-US finding score `` absence RVT '' residual thrombus occupy , maximum compressibility , le 40 % vein area . Patients without RVT continue anticoagulation ( Group B ) , whereas RVT continue OAT ( INR 2.0-3.0 ) least additional 9 month . Study outcomes Follow-up . From assignment visit , patient follow least one year OAT discontinuation ; follow-up period , patient contact clinical center every 3 month . C-US perform recurrent symptomatic DVT suspect . The study outcome composite confirm recurrent venous thromboembolism ( include DVT and/or fatal non-fatal pulmonary embolism ) major bleed event index DVT last day follow-up . In case suspect DVT recurrence result ultrasonography compare previous examination . A diagnosis recurrent venous thrombosis make previously fully compressible segment ( contralateral ipsilateral ) become incompressible . In absence previous normal C-US , DVT recurrence diagnose previously non-occlusive thrombus shift occlusive thrombus , provide vein area compression increase &gt; 4 mm ) ; undetermined case , contrast venography perform . In patient suspected pulmonary embolism , diagnosis recurrence base objective algorithm use clinical probability , ventilation-perfusion lung scanning/helical compute tomography , compression ultrasonography and/or D-dimer indicate . The diagnosis clinically relevant haemorrhage make case decrease haemoglobin level &gt; 2.0 gr/dl , retroperitoneal , intracranial life-threatening . Patients instructed contact clinical center immediately symptoms developed suggestive venous thromboembolism bleed . All suspect outcome event death evaluate central adjudication committee whose member unaware name subject , enrol center , C-US finding assign group . Statistical analysis . Baseline differences group assess chi-square test ( Yates ' correction ) categorical variable t-test Mann-Withney U test continuous variable , appropriate . Data analyze intention-to-treat basis . Kaplan-Meier survival curve plot estimate cumulative incidence symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism major bleeding . Patients study develop clinical condition interfere study outcome ( ischemic heart disease , cancer , stroke , superficial vein thrombosis , etc ) leave assign group regularly followed-up include analysis . Hazard ratios 95 percent confidence interval calculate use Cox 's proportional hazard model . The data analyze use Prism statistical software package ( Version 3.0 , GraphPad Software Incorporated , San Diego , CA ) SPSS statistical package ( Version 14.0 , SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
