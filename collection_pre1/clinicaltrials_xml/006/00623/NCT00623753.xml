	<brief_summary>Vaccines successful prevent viral infection hepatitis B measles . Viral vaccine work cause person 's immune system make cell work virus . Due success treat viral infection , scientist try develop vaccine human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . HIV infection cause acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . AIDS one serious viral infection know . This research study evaluate safety possible vaccine HIV . Researchers want determine person 's immune system respond HIV expose . Therefore person may able protected infection HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Tolerability Multi-envelope , Prime-boost HIV Vaccine Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study find safety new potential vaccine regimen HIV . This potential vaccine regimen consist sequence six vaccine shot study see help protect people human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . HIV infection cause AIDS . AIDS one serious viral infection know . Twenty million people around world already die AIDS 40 million people currently infect virus . This study do help u find HIV vaccine work . Vaccines successful prevent viral infection , hepatitis B , polio , measles . Viral vaccine work cause person 's immune system make antibody immune cell virus `` respond '' virus . Because success viral infection , scientist try develop successful vaccine HIV . If person 's immune system respond HIV expose , person may able protected infection HIV . The vaccine regimen test study base information virus us make small part HIV . This small part call `` envelope '' coat around virus . Because information one part virus use vaccine , vaccine cause HIV infection . We make part vaccine regimen test tube .</detailed_description>
