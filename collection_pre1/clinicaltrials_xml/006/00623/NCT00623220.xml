	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose study show inhale equimolar mixture oxygen nitrous oxide ( EMONO ) reduce pain associate retinal exam preterm infant , compare current standard treatment ( oral sucrose topical anaesthesia ) . The investigator also aim show EMONO use safely preterm neonate undergo retinal exam , result increase apnea , bradycardia , desaturation 24 hour follow exam . Finally , investigator aim show EMONO keep infant calm , make retinal examination easy less traumatic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods 1 . Study population : Eligible patient healthy preterm infant bear 30 0/7 less week gestation , weigh less 1500 gram birth , require retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) screen examination indicate AAP guideline . 2 . Recruitment : Patients recruit Royal Victoria Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit . Subjects enrol write informed consent obtain parent legal guardian . Although single patient may require multiple retinal exam , infant study protocol . Total number eligible patient , well consent refusal record study period . The study conduct two phase . A pilot phase , comprise 9 infant , perform first . The purpose pilot study establish safety EMONO indication , evaluate technical feasibility administer EMONO NICU setting , determine optimal nasal interface inhalation . All subject pilot phase receive EMONO . 40 baby recruit second phase study , randomize either therapeutic group ( EMONO ) , placebo group ( 50 % oxygen/50 % nitrogen ) . 3 . Gas administration : All 9 patient pilot phase , patient randomize intervention group receive EMONO . The mixture obtain use hospital compress oxygen tank N2O ( Praxair Canada Inc , Mississauga , ON ) . N2O oxygen mixed via Bird low flow nitrous oxide blender ( Summit Technologies , Burlington , ON ) obtain mixture 50 % O2 50 % N2O . Subjects control group receive mixture 50 % O2 50 % N2 . This produce mixing hospital air oxygen blender . Before study , respiratory therapy technician open gas valves one randomly connect patient 's inhalation device . The research team bedside able see gas output patient connect . Study control gas administer one three device pilot phase study : nasal cannula ( Airlife Infant Cushion Nasal Cannula , Cardinal Health , McGraw Park , IL ) , clear plastic infant resuscitation mask , clear plastic non-rebreather mask ( Medium concentration infant oxygen mask , Rusch Medical , Duluth , GA ) . Three patient studied device , different gas flow use . The optimal inhalation device , duration inhalation , gas flow thus determine used 40 patient 2nd phase study . 4 . Randomization : The gas administer subject determine randomly . Sealed opaque envelope prepare advance , contain one infant 's assignment . The envelope open respiratory therapy technician set inhalation circuit . 5 . Study protocol : All study conduct Royal Victoria Hospital NICU . Complete neonatal resuscitation equipment , meet AAP Neonatal Resuscitation Program standard , available hand . The following personnel present study : neonatologist ( usually one co-investigators ) , license respiratory therapist charge gas administration , two register nurse experience care neonate ( one nurse responsible restrain infant monitoring baby 's vital sign ) , ophthalmologist experienced ROP screen conduct retinal exam . Studies perform morning routine nursing care baby . Infants pre-treated 30 minute phenylephrine 2.5 % 1 drop eye , cyclopentolate 1.5 % 1 drop eye , do routinely unit eye exam . Infants place cardio-respiratory monitoring use one monitor available unit . All infant swaddle held nurse , routinely do unit . The inhalation device place infant respiratory therapist , allow control study gas administration . During pilot phase ocular manipulation start adequate analgesia obtain , maximum 15 minute pass . This allow u determine duration inhalation necessary effective analgesia , duration use randomized phase trial . All infant group receive oral sucrose pain relief per unit protocol . A pharmacy prepared solution sucrose 24 % use . Sucrose administer orally pre-prepared 1mL syrinx , give 0.1 mL aliquot , maximum 0.3 mL . Proparacaine HCl 0.5 % eye drop instill retinal examination perform ophthalmologist , infant hold bedside nurse . Both nurse present separately score infant 's pain response , begin examination , examination , 2 hour . Only first eye examine score , since eye examine rapid succession PIPP score time decrease eye . After complete exam , infant return standard nursing care . All infant monitor continuously pulse oximetry 24 hour exam . Additionally , infant pilot study phase undergo full 24 hour sleep study exam . 6 . Measurements : * Primary outcome : The primary objective show decrease pain response treatment group measure PIPP ( Premature Infant Pain Profile ) score . The PIPP score multidimensional composite pain score develop evaluate acute procedural pain preterm neonate . Its use validate clinical setting , high intra inter-rater reliability . It measure 7 different element include physiological parameter , facial expression , behaviour gestational age . Each evaluate scale 0 3 , yield combine score range 0 21 . In initial validation study , baseline mean score infant 4.9 ± 1.0 , non painful event yield mean score 9.0 ± 0.8 , painful heelsticks measure 11.0 ± 1.3 . All nurse unit fully train use PIPP score . * Secondary outcome : After exam , ophthalmologist evaluate ease perform procedure , well degree agitation infant use simple ordinal scale . Heart respiratory rate monitor use one NICU integrated monitor : Draeger Infinity Gamma XL ( Draeger Medical Canada Inc , Richmond Hill , ON ) , HP Agilent V29C/HP 895 ( Hewlett Packard Company , Palo Alto , CA ) . Continuous pulse oximetry perform Masimo Radical pulse oximeter ( Masimo Corp. , Irvine , CA ) , data analyze use ProFox oximetry software ( Escondido , CA ) . Infants pilot study undergo full cardiorespirogram , continuous measurement heart rate , respiratory impedance , thermistor nasal airflow , pulse oximetry ( Eden Trace II Eden Trace Analysis Software , Mallinckrodt Co , St-Louis , MO ) . Data sample 4 Hz record personal computer . Apnea define absence airflow 15 second . Drops oxygen saturation measure total time spend 88 % number episodes 88 % . It policy unit maintain oxygen saturation level 88 % 92 % preterm infant . 7 . Data collection : The follow data collect record study infant , use patient chart , maternal chart , nursing record , respiratory therapy data sheet : sex , birthweight , gestational age birth , current weight , relevant maternal history antenatal risk factor , previous respiratory care include mode duration ventilatory support , frequency apnea bradycardia , major neonatal complication ( hyaline membrane disease , persistent ductus arteriosus , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , necrotizing enterocolitis , intra-ventricular hemorrhage ) , medication receive include opiate caffeine . The CRIB II score ( Clinical Risk Index Babies ) admission compute infant study . All patient data relate study keep locked filing cabinet , locked office Royal Victoria Hospital . Only co-investigators access data . 8 . Sample size calculation : For pilot study , total number 9 patient choose , allow three patient study different nasal inhalation device . For randomized trial portion , data PIPP score review eye exam perform September 2006 February 2007 unit . A total 16 eligible exam complete data identify . Mean PIPP score 13.4 ± 3.4 . A 25 % reduction would bring PIPP score 10 , average painful event describe Ballantyne et al , also clinically reasonable meaningful target . We calculate would take approximately 20 patient group , control placebo , show reduction PIPP score 13.4 10 use two sample t-test . A two-tailed alpha level 0.05 use , power 0.8 . Data Royal Victoria Hospital NICU show approximately 85 infant &lt; 32 0/7 week &lt; 1500g admit per year . We would estimate enrollment study would take approximately 1 year . 9 . Statistics : Continuous numerical data control intervention group compare use two-sample t-test normally distribute variable . The Wilcoxon rank sum test use data distribute normally . Categorical data compare use chi-squared test .</detailed_description>
