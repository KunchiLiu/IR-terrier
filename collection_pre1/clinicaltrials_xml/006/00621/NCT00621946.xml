	<detailed_description>Primary Aim 1 ) Determine escitalopram treatment associate less oral corticosteroid use asthma symptom control placebo asthma outpatient moderate MDD . Secondary Aims 1 . Determine escitalopram treatment associate great improvement asthma symptom placebo outpatient severe asthma moderate severe MDD . 2 . Determine escitalopram treatment associate great depressive symptom remission rate placebo outpatient severe asthma moderate severe MDD . Background/Significance Asthma common , chronic general medical condition characterize inflammation variable , usually reversible , airflow obstruction . Approximately 7.2 % people United States history asthma . Asthma common increase prevalence mortality especially low-income minority population . The course asthma appear influenced mood emotion . It report high prevalence depression depressive symptom child adult asthma . Depression associate increase use asthma-related urgent care service , well variety unfavorable asthma outcome . In addition possible association depression asthma medication nonadherence even death , depression appear associate increased use emergency room , hospital , unscheduled appointment asthma . Despite data frequency depression asthma adverse consequence , generally recognize treat . Our propose study different . We observe modest difference antidepressant placebo prior trial . However , subgroup severe asthma ( base frequent corticosteroid use ) severe depression ( base higher depressive symptom score ) saw much large effect size . The propose study target subgroup . The sample size base effect size observe subgroup previous pilot study . A placebo control trial need 1 ) primary outcome previous trial significant . Therefore , clear antidepressant treatment effective depressed asthma patient . 2 ) We identify subgroup great depressive symptom asthma severity base post-hoc analysis appear show favorable response antidepressant . Thus , want confirm post-hoc finding target prospective study . In clinical population study , patient ever receive assessment treatment depression . Therefore , would withhold clearly effective treatment would otherwise receive . Standard care severe asthma aggressive asthma treatment . Our study require change patient 's asthma treatment . No guideline currently available treatment depression asthma patient . Standard care depression would antidepressant .</detailed_description>
