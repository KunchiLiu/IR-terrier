	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Between Ezetimibe Tacrolimus After Single Dose Administration Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemia frequent find organ transplant recipient receive immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus . To prevent increased cardiovascular morbidity mortality patient , co-medication lipid-lowering statin recommend . However , treatment statin limit many patient insufficient cholesterol-lowering efficacy , drug interaction serious adverse drug reaction ( e.g . rhabdomyolysis ) . These patient may benefit comedication cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe . Since tacrolimus ezetimibe show substrate efflux transporter ABCB1 ( P-glycoprotein ) , drug interaction compound may occur . Therefore , clinical study healthy subject initiate evaluate clinical relevance drug/drug interaction tacrolimus ezetimibe accord accepted bioequivalence approach .</detailed_description>
