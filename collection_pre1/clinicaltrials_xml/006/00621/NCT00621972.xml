	<brief_summary>This observational study assess impact conventional dose iodinate contrast renal function advance chronic kidney disease patient undergo arteriovenous fistula evaluation use standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol . In addition , model allows pre post procedure measurement kidney function , provide unique opportunity ass utility novel biomarkers contrast-induced kidney injury . Our primary hypothesis change serum creatinine post-procedure use standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol . Our secondary hypothesis change urinary kidney-injury marker-1 ( KIM-1 ) post-procedure use standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol . In addition , assess impact different patient characteristic development contrast-induced kidney injury , diabetes , coronary artery disease , hypertension , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AV Fistula Salvage Advanced CKD Using Sodium Bicarbonate Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Kidney Foundation publish kidney disease outcome guideline improve care chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient . Regarding hemodialysis vascular access , recommendation early placement arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) improve morbidity mortality outcomes , specifically glomerular filtration rate le 25ml/min , correspond stage 4 5 CKD . Despite advantage , need surveillance AVF determine maturation use maintain optimal longevity require use interventional procedure . While radiocontrast use lead acute , often reversible kidney injury , use AVF evaluation renew interest recent implication gadolinium-enhanced MRI associate rare disorder skin swell induration call nephrogenic systemic fibrosis . CKD patient particularly susceptible long term adverse outcomes contrast-induced kidney injury , 1 year mortality stage 4 5 CKD patient 44 % 62 % , respectively . While optimal fluid therapy prevent contrast-induced kidney injury remain uncertain , several prospective randomize trial use sodium bicarbonate pretreatment show low incidence contrast-related kidney injury compare isotonic saline . Traditional marker acute kidney injury , include serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine clearance insensitive differentiate contrast-induced kidney injury form renal injury . Kidney injury marker-1 ( KIM-1 ) transmembrane receptor induce high level proximal tubule nephron follow ischemic nephrotoxic injury . KIM-1 show small cohort patient differentiate ischemic kidney injury form acute chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
