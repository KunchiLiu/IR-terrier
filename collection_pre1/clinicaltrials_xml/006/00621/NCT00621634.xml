	<detailed_description>Background Tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) well-known complication antipsychotic drug ( APD ) therapy individual treat mental disorder schizophrenia . It typically consist purposeless , involuntary movement involve oro-facial area , trunk , and/or limb muscle , occur within month year APD use . Twisting protrude movement tongue , lip smack puckering , chew movement , often observe . Oral dyskinesia may cause pain , traumatic lesion , tooth wear , impaired retention prosthetic device , chew difficulty , dysphagia , speech impairment , well social embarrassment . The annual incidence TD population treat drug 1-5 % , risk old individual 5-fold great . The second-generation ( `` atypical '' ) APDs substantially reduce short-term risk TD , annual incidence TD old individual take drug remain comparable young adult treat first-generation APDs . The cause TD unknown . Since APDs blocker dopamine D2 receptor brain , researcher hypothesize receptor ( signal pathway ) become supersensitive way promote TD . APDs also modulate expression number brain factor belong nuclear receptor family , include Retinoid X Receptors ( RXR ) Nur77 , overexpressed follow chronic APD treatment . These factor , seemingly mount adaptive response fend adverse drug reaction TD , may become incompetent insufficient time individual develop TD . One way activate response supplement diet high dos essential fatty acid omega-3 class , constitute critical component nerve cell membrane modulate variety brain receptor . Once trigger , TD often irreversible untreatable . However , one team recently show 50 % reduction severity TD-like movement mice treat docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) . Hypothesis Since apparent close relationship retinoid receptor dopamine system human brain DHA RXR agonist , work hypothesis DHA reduce TD intensity patient live schizophrenia increase transcriptional activity along pathway . Objective To evaluate clinical impact DHA intensity TD human . Study design Forty ( 40 ) subject 30-75 year age recruit . The participant randomize equally distribute parallel group take either DHA ( 3 gram day ) match placebo capsule 12 week , provide informed consent . The study use questionnaire , venous blood sampling , well clinical scale , monitor psychiatric condition , lipid profile , TD intensity begin end study . Brief simple task also complete motion analysis system use magnetic sensor order measure body movement TD accuracy . Outcome The finding beneficial effect DHA TD would improve quality life thousand patient long-term APD treatment .</detailed_description>
