	<brief_summary>Amyloidosis result tissue deposition amyloid protein , compose mainly fragment monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain . Accumulation amyloid protein progressively disrupt normal tissue structure ultimately lead organ failure , frequently kidney , heart , liver peripheral nervous system . A recently complete French prospective randomize trial , patient present newly AL-amyloidosis , compare two treatment regimen time diagnosis : Melphalan-dexamethasone ( conventional oral treatment ) , versus high dose Melphalan follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) ( 1 ) . High-dose therapy associate well outcome . Melphalan-dex give monthly consider current standard care , median survival 56 month . The use combination lenalidomide dexamethasone already test patient AL-amyloidosis ( 2 ) . The initial dose lenalidomide 25 mg/day poorly tolerate . However , 15 mg/day dose regimen well tolerated effective , overall hematologic response rate 67 % . Hematologic responses associate clinical response . Dispenzieri et al confirm combination Lenalidomide + dexamethasone achieve 75 % hematologic response rate , 42 % organ response , median follow-up 17 month patient still receive treatment ( 2006 ) . These author also recommend low dose 15mg/day . The rationale present investigation addition lenalidomide current standard care ( Melphalan-dexamethasone ) might improve hematologic response rate organ response rate associate prolonged survival patient AL-amyloidosis . As toxicity combination M-dex + lenalidomide unknown patient AL-amyloidosis , dose lenalidomide start low one available , i.e. , 5 mg/day increase 5 5 mg maximum dose 15 mg combination M-dex 3 consecutive cohort patient , accord toxicity . When optimal dose lenalidomide define , 9 additional patient include trial recommend dose-level ass feasibility combination M-dex-lenalidomide .</brief_summary>
