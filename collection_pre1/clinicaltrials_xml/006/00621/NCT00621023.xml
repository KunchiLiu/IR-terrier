	<brief_title>Cephalon Decitabine , Arsenic Trioxide Ascorbic Acid Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional therapy MDS poor best . Supportive care transfusion therapy antibiotic remain option patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The known curative therapy allogeneic bone marrow transplant . However due high morbidity elderly population lack available donor , estimate less 5 % patient MDS candidate type aggressive therapy . Investigational therapy thus warrant MDS . Decitabine show significant clinical activity patient MDS , moderate toxicity . The major toxicity myelosuppression subsequent infection occur 20-25 % patient . Arsenic trioxide FDA approve drug treatment patient acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) refractory , relapse , retinoid anthracycline chemotherapy . Two pivotal study arsenic trioxide set relapse APL show complete remission rate 87 % 36 month survival estimate 50 % . As May 2004 , 800 patient receive arsenic trioxide clinical study compassionate use program , additional 3600 patient receive drug clinical practice . Arsenic trioxide show clinical activity MDS . Side effect note manageable . Adult patient establish diagnosis MDS receive decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV one hour days1-5 cycle , arsenic trioxide 0.25 mg/kg IV day 1-5 cycle 1 follow 0.25 mg/kg twice weekly ( Mon-Thursday Tues-Fri ) remain cycle . The dose ascorbic acid 1000 mg 100 mL solution 5 % dextrose water ( D5W ) ( protect light air ) administer IV infusion 15 30 minute administer within 30 minute arsenic trioxide administration . Each cycle consist 4 week treatment , patient assess cycle toxicity , 4 cycle response define International Working Group ( IWG - see section 8.0 ) . Patients transfusion supportive care therapy administer per treat physician 's discretion . Patients response ( complete response - CR , partial remission - PR , hematologic improvement ) 4 cycle therapy may choose continue two cycle decitabine arsenic ascorbic acid give first week two additional cycle .</detailed_description>
