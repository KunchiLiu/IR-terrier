	<brief_summary>1 . To assess effect RG1068 dose 0.2 mcg/kg intravenously ( IV ) diameter pancreatic duct use Magnetic Resonance Pancreatography 2 . To demonstrate RG1068-enhanced MRCP improve detection characterization intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) relative unenhanced MRCP patient suspect IPMN 3 . To correlate finding MRCP histologically confirm malignancy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Secretin Enhanced MRCP Evaluation Known Suspected Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until relatively recently , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) primary diagnostic therapeutic modality assess patient suspect pancreatic disease abnormality . However , invasive procedure carry significant potential complication include acute pancreatitis , hemorrhage infection , well reaction contrast material premedications exposure radiation . In addition , success procedure , standpoint safety efficacy , highly dependent skill endoscopist , cost ERCP relatively high . The advent magnetic resonance imaging result development less expensive , non-invasive , radiation-free mean assess pancreaticobiliary system : Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) . MRCP use stationary water biliary pancreatic secretion intrinsic contrast medium , thus facilitate examination pancreatic biliary duct surround tissue . Secretin , promote secretion pancreatic fluid pancreatic duct , thereby enhance MR image signal , improve delineation normal abnormal structure , well highlight abnormal fluid collection leakage . Conversely , fill defect indicate presence stone mass lesion . This study undertake prospectively assess effectiveness RG1068-enhanced MRCP relative unenhanced MRCP evaluation patient know suspected IPMN . RG1068 synthetic human secretin pharmacological profile similar biological synthetic porcine secretin . Secretin 27-amino acid gastrointestinal peptide hormone produce S-cells duodenum response pH decrease cause passage partially digest food stomach intestine . RG1068 identical amino acid sequence naturally occur human secretin differs porcine secretin 2 amino acid .</detailed_description>
