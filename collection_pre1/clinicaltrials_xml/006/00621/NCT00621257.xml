	<brief_summary>Research show child Inflammatory Bowel Disease may lower level vitamin D healthy child , especially winter . Vitamin D important grow maintain healthy bone throughout life , particularly important , since child IBD frequently low bone density . It may also helpful treatment IBD , help reduce inflammation . Vitamin D level measure amount 25 OHD blood ; however , measure level regular basis yet standard child IBD . The purpose study find best way treat low vitamin D level , maintain good vitamin D level throughout year . It also test whether high vitamin D level improve bone health child IBD , whether help milder disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Levels Children With IBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D essential bone mineralization . The prevalence vitamin D insufficiency [ serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration ( 25OHD ) ≤ 20 ng/mL ] high among adult inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , even high pediatric patient IBD . Protein-losing enteropathy could represent etiologic factor hypovitaminosis D , obstacle treat IBD patient . There currently guideline treatment hypovitaminosis D adult child IBD . Moreover obtain evidence optimal vitamin D store ( 25OHD ≥32 ng/mL ) may maintain throughout year patient IBD follow current RDA recommendation . On hand , prevalence low bone mineral density high among young patient IBD , period life experience rapid acquisition bone mass . Optimization vitamin D status impact bone health child IBD study . In addition , vitamin D may play important role regulation immune system support animal model colitis vitro human study . Prospective study effect vitamin D supplementation disease outcomes undertaken child IBD date . We aim perform ) randomize control trial compare efficacy 3 regimen treat vitamin D insufficiency pediatric patient IBD period 6 week . We also evaluate effect regimen marker bone resorption , bone formation parathyroid hormone level , relationship magnitude gastrointestinal protein loss , reflect clearance fecal alpha -1-antitrypsin , efficacy treatment . b ) We also aim perform randomize controlled trial compare efficacy 2 regimen different dos oral vitamin D2 maintain optimal vitamin D store pediatric patient IBD period 2 year . We intend study effect regimen ) bone mass acquisition ( measure via DXA pQCT ) bone strength ( measure via pQCT ) , b ) bone formation resorption marker parathyroid hormone , c ) disease outcomes disease severity period time .</detailed_description>
