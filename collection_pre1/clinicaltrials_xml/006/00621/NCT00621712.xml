	<brief_summary>The study investigate efficacy catheter antibacterial surface coat prevent central venous catheter relate infection effect intensive hygiene catheter care education nurse staff prevent central venous catheter-related infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment New Catheter Surface Coating With Antimicrobial Properties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk catheter-related bloodstream infection depend catheter type , method site insertion , aseptic technique number manipulation . To address problem , effort focus engineering biomaterials surface antibacterial property prevent bacteria adhesion biofilm formation . In view necessity reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection inadequacy currently available antimicrobially coated device , new antimicrobial catheter surface develop . Among factor , mode quality catheter handle care exit site important aspect respect catheter-related infection . The clinical study aim provide data antimicrobial efficiency 2 type CE certify double lumen catheter suppose additional preventive effect intense hygiene train catheter-related infection .</detailed_description>
