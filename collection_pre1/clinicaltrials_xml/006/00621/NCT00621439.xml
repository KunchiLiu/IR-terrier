	<brief_title>Investigative Trial Interferon Alpha-2b To Shrink Cancer Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study explore whether drug pegylated-interferon-alfa-2b ( PEG-IFN ) effect certain type immune cell ( call natural killer cell ) patient eye melanoma . Because drug currently investigate use skin melanoma , think drug might benefit eye melanoma well , natural killer cell might important drug work . Patients choose take part study randomize receive either drug , PEG-IFN . Four day prior patient 's surgery remove eye , 50cc blood drawn . Patients randomize PEG-IFN give drug , 4 day prior surgery . Blood also draw day surgery ( 50cc ) , 1 week surgery ( 50cc ) , 1 month ( 500cc ) , 6 month ( 50cc ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must uveal melanoma enucleation indicate , usually lesion great 8 mm diameter great 2 mm thickness . Patients evidence metastatic disease determine history , physical examination , appropriate liver injury enzyme . Patients receive prior interferon . Age &gt; 18 year . Because limited data use pegylated interferon patient &lt; 18 year age uncertainties possible difference NK response , child exclude study . Since ocular melanoma rare child expect issue . Life expectancy great 3 month ECOG performance status 0 2 ( Karnofsky 60 % good ; see Appendix II ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Hgb &gt; /= 12.5 g/dl hematocrit &gt; /= 38 % Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit unless patient Gilbert 's syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) within normal institutional limit . Patients elevated level either enzyme may accept elevation less equal 2x institutional upper limit normal patient normal liver CT MRI . Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry one year study drug give . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial . Patients agent know immunosuppressive ( e.g , glucocorticoid ) within 4 week prior plan receipt study drug . Patients receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study interferon alpha potential teratogenic effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother interferon , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent . HIVpositive patient ineligible know immunosuppression associate disease . Patients history malignancy eligible provide clinically free metastasis time study . Patients donate blood 56 day prior 500cc blood draw study eligible .</criteria>
