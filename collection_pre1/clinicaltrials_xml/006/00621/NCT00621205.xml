	<brief_summary>Lifestyle genetic factor interact development obesity metabolic syndrome . The molecular mechanism underlie beneficial dietary modification , however , unclear . We aim examine effect long-term 30 moderate weight reduction gene expression adipose tissue ( AT ) identify gene gene cluster responsive treatment thereby likely contribute development metabolic syndrome . Thus , randomize control individualized weight reduction physical exercise intervention conduct . In WR group , glucose metabolism improve see group . Moreover , inverse correlation change SI change body weight find ( r =-0.44 , p=0.026 ) . Down-regulation gene expression ( p &lt; 0.01 ) involve gene ontology group extracellular matrix , cell death see . Such change occur group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression Obesity Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study examine expression gene gene region involve obesity , insulin resistance lipid metabolism . We aim identify new gene involve development metabolic aberration characteristic metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes . Obesity type 2 diabetes increase medical public health problem globally . Low HDL cholesterol elevate triglyceride concentration , alter cholesterol metabolism common state . More knowledge urgently need role genetics obesity , insulin resistance abnormal lipid metabolism mutual relationship . This would enable early detection subject increase risk develop obesity common abnormality relate , i.e . insulin resistance abnormal lipid metabolism , well identification subject genotypes associate increased risk mention metabolic state atherosclerotic vascular disease decrease responsiveness conventional treatment . Because weight loss regular physical exercise result substantial change glucose , insulin lipid metabolism , study aim explore function relevant gene highly interest . In study , gene expression measure adipose tissue leucocyte weight loss period regular physical exercise . Originally , Genobin study include 75 middle-aged ( mean age 60±7 year ) overweight obese ( mean BMI 32.9±2.8 kg/m2 ) men woman impair fast glucose ( fast plasma glucose concentration 5.6-7.0 mmol/l ) impair glucose tolerance ( 2-hour plasma glucose concentration 7.8-11.0 mmol/l fast plasma glucose &lt; 7.1 mmol/l ) two additional feature metabolic syndrome accord Adult Treatment Panel III criterion [ 49 ] ( detail see [ 50 ] ) . Subjects randomized one follow group : weight reduction ( WR ) ( n=28 ) , aerobic exercise training ( n=15 ) , resistance exercise training ( n=14 ) control group ( n=18 ) . Subjects match age , sex status glucose metabolism . In addition , 11 normal-weight subject ( mean age 48±9 year , mean BMI 23.7±1.9 kg/m2 ) recruit . The intervention perform accordance standard Helsinki Declaration . The Ethics Committee District Hospital Region Northern Savo Kuopio University Hospital approve study plan , participant give write informed consent . At begin study 9-11 month follow measurement perform : plasma/serum concentration glucose , insulin , total lipoprotein lipid , free fatty acid , non-cholesterol sterol , glycerol , leptin , adiponectin , ghrelin , tumor necrosis factor α , C-reactive protein , waist hip circumference , body composition rest energy expenditure . A DNA sample drawn adipose tissue biopsy perform . A frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIGT ) perform assess insulin sensitivity secretion . Given biochemical measurement perform also 3 month .</detailed_description>
