	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab sorafenib may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving bevacizumab together sorafenib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give bevacizumab together sorafenib work treat patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Identify clinical efficacy bevacizumab sorafenib , measure 6-month progression-free survival , patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Secondary - Assess time progression patient population . - Assess overall survival patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib daily day 1-14 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood plasma sample collection baseline periodically study treatment translational research study . Translational research study include analysis circulate endothelial cell circulate endothelial progenitor cell flow cytometry measurement angiogenic protein plasma ELISA . DNA buffy coat extract collect blood sample pharmacogenetic study . Quality life assess baseline , prior every treatment course , end treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28-42 day , every 3 month 5 year , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
