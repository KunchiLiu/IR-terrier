	<brief_summary>This clinical study design study effect supplemental intake enriched omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( fish oil ) patient moderate severe asthma . Some asthmatic produce large amount inflammatory leukotriene proteinsâ€”proteins contribute wheeze inflammation airway . Inhibiting detrimental effect leukotrienes key goal controller therapy severe asthmatic . Some asthmatic patient appear specific mutation arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ( ALOX5 ) gene , one gene regulate production inflammatory leukotrienes . Omega-3 fatty acid interfere arachidonic acid pathway decrease production leukotrienes , may benefit moderate severe asthma patient . Our hypothesis omega-3 fatty acid supplement , add patient 's asthma medication regimen , decrease number minor asthma exacerbation compare patient receive supplement . Furthermore , believe asthma patient specific ALOX5 gene mutation benefit . We enroll 30 asthma subject take part trial . They undergo genotyping ALOX5 gene treat omega3-fatty acid ( fish oil ) placebo nine month period . We expect strategy allow u discover moderate severe asthma patient benefit supplement omega-3 fatty acid . Treatment chronic disease , asthma , key mission Center Health Nutrition Research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Oil Prevent Asthma Exacerbations Patients With ALOX5 Polymorphisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-center , investigator-initiated , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over trial . A total 30 subject recruit U.C . Davis Asthma Network ( UCAN ) clinic . Some research conduct USDA-WHNRC ( Western Health Nutrition Research Center ) U.C . Davis . This clinical trial design study effect supplemental intake eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) -enriched omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n3-PUFA , fish oil ) subset moderate severe asthmatic , high susceptibility increase leukotriene production due polymorphism promoter region arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ( ALOX5 ) gene . EPA compete AA decrease leukotriene production ; thus central hypothesis EPA-enriched n3-PUFA supplement decrease production inflammatory leukotrienes decrease number acute exacerbation asthma patient moderate severe asthma benefit great subject `` high susceptibility '' ALOX5 promoter variant . Our specific aim : 1 ) Determine prevalence `` high-susceptibility '' ALOX5 pathway gene polymorphisms diverse cohort moderate severe adult asthmatic , 2 ) Perform 32 week ( 12 wk treatment A - 8 wk washout - 12 wk treatment B ) , blind , cross-over design clinical trial , treat 15 `` high susceptibility '' 15 `` low susceptibility '' ALOX5 gene polymorphism asthmatic n-3 PUFA supplement placebo , 3 ) Determine baseline level treatment effect n-3 PUFA supplement leukotriene metabolite inflammatory cytokine production subject 'high ' 'low ' susceptibility genotype . Patients recruit primarily UC Davis Asthma Network ( UCAN ) .</detailed_description>
