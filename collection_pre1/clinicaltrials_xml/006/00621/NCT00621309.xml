	<brief_summary>Adverse drug-drug interaction ( DDIs ) responsible approximately 3 % hospitalization US , perhaps cost $ 1.3 billion per year . One common cause DDIs one drug alters metabolism another . A key enzyme liver intestine , call `` cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) generally consider important drug metabolize enzyme . The gene CYP3A4 'turned ' presence certain drug , result much high level CYP3A4 liver intestine . Thus , drug induces CYP3A4 give another drug metabolize 3A4 , 'drug-drug ' interaction occurs first drug ( inducer ) greatly change rate second drug ( CYP3A4 substrate ) remove body . Many drug increase CYP3A4 activity bind receptor call Pregnane-X-Receptor ( PXR ) , major switch control expression CYP3A4 gene . Using human liver cell demonstrate sulforaphane ( SFN ) , find broccoli , block drug activate PXR receptor , thereby inhibit switch cause CYP3A4 induction . The purpose project determine SFN use block adverse DDIs occur drug bind activate PXR receptor subsequently induce CYP3A4 activity . We recruit 24 human volunteer participate study . This project determine whether SFN prevent drug Rifampin binding PXR increase CYP3A4 activity human follow oral administration SFN ( broccoli sprout extract ) . The rate removal small dose drug midazolam use determine enzymatic activity CYP3A4 follow treatment Rifampin , presence absence SFN , since midazolam eliminate bloodstream CYP3A4 . . We predict SFN prevent increase midazolam clearance ( metabolism ) normally follow treatment antibiotic , rifampicin . This research important could potentially lead simple , cost-effective way prevent one common cause adverse drug-drug interaction occurs today . For example , rifampicin , cheap effective antibiotic use treat TB , use HIV/AIDS patient increase metabolism many antiretroviral drug use treat HIV/AIDS . TB major opportunistic infection AIDS patient , serious clinical problem , especially develop country expensive alternative drug therapy available . We hypothesize co-formulation rifampicin SFN could block drug-drug interaction without alter efficacy , thereby allow use HIV/AIDS patient infect TB . This one example numerous drug-drug interaction occur via mechanism .</brief_summary>
