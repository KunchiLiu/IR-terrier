	<brief_summary>Subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) may cause damage hypotalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA ) thus disturb hormonal response structure . The aim study characterize function HPA-axis acutely time three month patient SAH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothalamo- , Pituitary- , Adrenal Axis Dysfunction Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypotalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) -axis may affect SAH temporary permanent damage hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland . Also surgery endovascular treatment rupture intracranial aneurysm may affect hormonal response HPA-axis . Some data suggest high incidence delay endocrine abnormality patient SAH little data exists acute endocrine abnormality disease . We study pituitary-adrenal hormone level patient acute aneurysmal SAH patient admit elective cranial aneurysm surgery serve control population . We use serum free cortisol calculation total cortisol measurement well adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation test assess responsiveness adrenal gland exogenous ACTH . The hormone level measure repeatedly first seven day SAH three month .</detailed_description>
