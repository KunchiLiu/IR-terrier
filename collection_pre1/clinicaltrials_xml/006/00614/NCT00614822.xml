Bevacizumab continue tolerate 1 year every 3 week interval . Folic acid 1mg mouth daily , Vitamin B12 1000 ug IM every 9 week Dexamethasone 4mg mouth twice day antiemetic may prescribe physician investigator help reduce side effect associate Pemetrexed . The Folic acid Vitamin B12 continue 3 week end treatment . Physical exam , vital sign blood work do prior chemotherapy cycle . A urine dipstick check protein urine do prior first treatment cycle 3 5 . A CAT scan chest do pretreatment , prior cycle 3 5 end treatment .</detailed_description>
