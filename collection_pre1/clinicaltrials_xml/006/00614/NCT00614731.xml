	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) skin disorder people often swell skin infection . People disease receive smallpox vaccine could cause fatal reaction know eczema vaccinatum ( EV ) . Keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) protein use deliver vaccine body . The purpose study determine baseline immune reaction KLH people without AD . Once establish , study design determine whether KLH use give vaccine people AD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Responses Immunization With Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin Administered Scarification Intradermal Route</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AD characterize skin inflammation recurrent skin infection . In addition , people AD may severe sometimes fatal reaction smallpox vaccine call EV . KLH carrier protein use deliver antibody body . However KLH , may cause immune response . The purpose study determine body 's reaction pure KLH people without AD . This used establish baseline immune response may compare immune response people AD future study . This study last 8 week 11 study visit . Participants study randomly assign 1 4 group . All participant receive immunization Visits 5 6 . Participants Group 1A receive 2 immunization 100 mcg KLH . Participants Group 2A receive 2 immunization scarification ( shallow cut skin ) jab , contain 20 mg/mL KLH . Adverse reaction monitor immunization . Once safety data 2 group review , next 2 group enrol . Participants Group 1B receive 2 immunization 250 mcg KLH . Participants Group 2B receive 2 immunization scarification 15 jab , contain 20mg/mL KLH . Other study visit include allergy test blood urine collection .</detailed_description>
