	<detailed_description>Current medical therapy end stage liver disease focus substitution blood plasma product , volume expansion antibiotic treatment . The specific treatment liver transplantation , limited available organ may therapeutic option minority patient recently deteriorate end stage liver disease . The clinical management defect hepatic synthesis metabolic regulation improve dramatically within past decade development transfusion intensive care medicine , replacement detoxification difficult , majority endogenous toxin accumulate liver failure bound albumin . Therefore , conventional dialysis hemofiltration show ineffective removal . The present study base theory , support fail liver removal toxic substance biocompatible method ( MARS system ) may improve capacity recovery patient .</detailed_description>
