	<brief_summary>In study investigator hypothesize High Definition White Light colonoscopy narrow band imaging ( NBI ) detect high number adenoma compare standard definition white light colonoscopy . NBI high accuracy predict polyp histology compare high definition colonoscopy standard colonoscopy . Specific Aim 1 - To compare prevalence adenomas detect standard colonoscopy , high-definition white light colonoscopy NBI . Specific Aim 2 - To compare number adenoma detect per subject standard colonoscopy , high-definition white light colonoscopy NBI . Specific Aim 3 - To compare accuracy predict polyp histology standard colonoscopy , high-definition white light colonoscopy NBI evaluate surface mucosal vascular pattern procedure . Specific Aim 4 - To determine inter-observer agreement investigator recognition various polyp pattern</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multi-center randomize control trial conduct Kansas City VA Medical Center , Kansas City , MO The Barnes Jewish Hospital , St Louis , MO . Patients refer screen surveillance colonoscopy enrol . They randomize one follow three group : standard white light colonoscopy , high-definition white light colonoscopy NBI . All colonoscopy perform Kansas City VA Medical Center The Barnes Jewish Hospital , St Louis , MO . Moderate sedation administer procedure intravenous midazolam , demerol fentanyl Propofol . In patient randomize NBI arm , colonoscope insert cecum white light switch NBI mode time withdrawal . After cecal intubation , colonic mucosa carefully visualize withdrawal scope one three image modality patient randomize . No effort make look polyps insertion colonoscope . All polyp detect documented size , morphology ( Polypoid : sessile , pedunculated Non polypoid : superficially elevate , completely flat , depressed ) , location . The surface polyp assess procedure histology predict real time evaluate surface mucosal vascular pattern . The pattern would classify one four pattern describe pilot study ( tubular gyrus pattern combine tubulogyrus pattern ) . Any pattern detect would describe keep miscellaneous category . If pattern identify polyp either white light NBI , record attempt make predict histology . Photo documentation surface pattern polyp perform . Polyps remove either biopsy forcep snare send histopathological evaluation . Each polyp remove one corresponding picture surface pattern label accordingly . The total time spend inspect colonic mucosa ( exclude time spend removal polyp clear colon liquid solid debris ) measure stop watch . Representative image various polyp pattern review , discuss standardized amongst investigator sit . In addition , image polyp pattern print post endoscopy suite hospital . The bowel preparation evaluate graded follow : Excellent ( score=1 ) - &gt; 90 % mucosa see , mostly liquid colonic content , minimal suctioning need adequate visualization . Good ( score=2 ) - &gt; 90 % mucosa see , mostly liquid colonic content , significant suctioning need adequate visualization Fair ( score=3 ) - &gt; 90 % mucosa see , mixture liquid semisolid colonic content , could suction and/or washed Inadequate ( score=4 ) - &lt; 90 % mucosa see , mixture semisolid ands solid colonic content , could suction wash Patients `` Inadequate '' ( score = 4 ) bowel prep exclude .</detailed_description>
