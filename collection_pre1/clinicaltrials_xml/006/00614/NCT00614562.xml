Mechanical ventilation â‰¥ 48 hour prior enrolment 5 . Presence Critical Illness Polyneuropathy / Polymyopathy ( CIP/M ) accord MRC Scale Muscle Examination 12 Muscle group ( Table 1 ) without loss sensibility muscle reflex . 6 . Presence least one follow risk factor ( A D ) know associated CIP/M . Note , risk factor need present enrolment need present prior enrolment actual stay ICU : A : severe sepsis define presence infection highly suspect proven three follow systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) criterion meet ( Bernard et al 2001 s. Figure 15 ) : core temperature great 38 degree celsius ( 100.4 degree F ) less 36 degree celsius ( 96.8 degree F ) ; heart rate great 90 beat per minute ; respiratory rate great 20 breath per minute , arterial carbon dioxide tension ( Paco2 ) great 32 mm Hg , mechanical ventilation acute process ; white cell count 12 000/mm3 less 4000/mm3 , differential count show 10 % immature neutrophil .
