	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , randomize , double blind , placebo control study design ass efficacy safety romiplostim ( formerly , AMG 531 ) treatment thrombocytopenic MDS patient . The study compose 26-week placebo control test treatment period ( romiplostim versus Placebo ) , 4 week interim wash-out period , 24-week placebo control extended treatment period , 4-week follow-up period follow End Study ( EOS ) visit . During interim wash-out period , bone marrow biopsy perform absence growth factor ass change marrow . In extended treatment period , safety assessment continue participant allow receive standard care treatment MDS . Patients follow survival additional 60 month follow End Study ( EOS ) visit .</detailed_description>
