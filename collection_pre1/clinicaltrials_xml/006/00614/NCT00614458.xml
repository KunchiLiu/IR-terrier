	<brief_title>MK-0518 Intensification And HDAC Inhibition In Depletion Of Resting CD4+ T Cell HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study see HIV persist despite current antiviral therapy target new treatment . Eradicating hidden , persistent virus ( call `` latent HIV '' ) may day allow HIV eliminate infected person . Recently discover class medicine , call histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor , may cause HIV hide within cell body express ( `` unmask '' ) . The HDAC inhibitor use study unmask flush latent HIV within cell call valproic acid ( VPA ) commonly use treat seizure depression brand name Depakote . VPA safely give people HIV treatment seizures depression . In first study , recruit 4 volunteer HIV-1 infection take antiviral therapy &lt; 50 copies/ml ( undetectable ) HIV virus RNA blood 6 month . In addition continue anti-HIV medication , start Fuzeon , new inject anti-HIV medication , one month . We add VPA anti-HIV medication Fuzeon 3 month . At end study , find latent HIV significantly decrease . No safety problem VPA antiviral medicine note . However , initiate Fuzeon VPA simultaneously could determine confidence finding due effect VPA alone . In next study add VPA therapy patient take standard antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Eight patient study far , three yet significant decrease latent HIV . It may VPA work everyone , strong HIV therapy need people drain latent HIV . And different study , decrease find number infected cell people take ART prescribed valproate reason . In study , wish add different new anti-HIV medicine , pill , Raltegravir ( MK-0518 ) . Raltegravir block virus permanently enter DNA T cell , call integrase inhibitor . Raltegravir investigational . This mean U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) yet approve sale . We see add Raltegravir VPA current ART decrease amount latent HIV . If add Raltegravir VPA ART effect , reach end study . If add Raltegravir VPA decrease latent infection , stop VPA continue Raltegravir see new integrase inhibitor decrease latent infection . This study expect cure HIV , take first step towards far-away goal . You ask join study infect HIV-1 virus ; 18 year age ; able willing sign inform consent . ; able laboratory test within study specific criterion ; adequate vein access leukopheresis .</detailed_description>

Willing adhere protocol therapy judge adherent antiretroviral therapy , comply time requirement protocolspecified visits evaluation . On potent antiretroviral therapy , define least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus least 1 protease inhibitor ( PI ) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , without change 24 week immediately prior entry . Prior change elimination medication easier dose schedule , intolerance , toxicity permit . Have contraindication valproic acid ( VPA ) therapy ( pregnancy , bleed disorder , history pancreatitis , history hepatitis ) . Have adequate vascular access leukopheresis Plasma HIV1 RNA never &gt; 50 copies/ml two consecutive occasion ≥ 6 month . CD4 cell count &gt; 300 cells/µl . Screening serum fast glucose 120 mg/dl , creatinine 1.5 time upper limit normal range , serum AST , ALT , total bilirubin le 2 time upper limit normal range , fast triglyceride &lt; 400mg/dl . Female study volunteer reproductive potential whose male partner ( ) undergone successful vasectomy document azoospermia document azoospermia reason , eligible without require use contraception . All woman reproductive potential must negative urine betaHCG pregnancy test perform screening , day 0 , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 , every schedule study visit thereafter . All study volunteer must agree participate conception process , participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female study volunteer/male partner must use two reliable method contraception simultaneously receive protocolspecified medication 6 week stop medication . Subjects must use reliable barrier method contraception along another form contraception . For woman receive ritonavir , estrogenbased contraceptive reliable alternative method use . Receiving zidovudine ( AZT ) . Due inhibition zidovudine metabolism mediate Valproic acid ( VPA ) theoretical increase risk zidovudineinduced anemia exists . Using drug know interact valproate raltegravir ( MK0518 ) Pregnant nursing . Anemic ( Hemoglobin &lt; 10gm/dl ) Seropositive hepatitis C RNA hepatitis B surface antigen within 90 day prior entry . Have sign symptom hepatic decompensation Received blood transfusion hematopoetic growth factor within 90 day . Use follow within 90 day prior entry : systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational agent , immunomodulators . Active drug alcohol use dependence . Serious illness require systemic treatment hospitalization subject either complete therapy clinically stable therapy , opinion site investigator , least 90 day prior entry . Compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric illness physical illness , e.g. , infectious disease . Treatment active AIDSdefining opportunistic infection within 90 day prior screen . For pilot study direct benefit subject , nonEnglish speaking patient exclude . In future , study expand include large sample size , exclusion criterion may remove .</criteria>
