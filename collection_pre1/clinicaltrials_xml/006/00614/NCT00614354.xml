	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial study ability radioactive drug call `` Technetium Glucarate '' detect whether cause chest pain patient enter emergency department obvious sign heart attack due condition call Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) . The drug inject intravenously . After one two hour patient undergo image procedure detect drug accumulate heart . Uptake radioactive drug heart indicative reduce blood flow heart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 99mTc-glucarate Detect Acute Coronary Syndrome Chest Pain Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute coronary syndrome encompasses range coronary artery disease , include unstable angina ST-segment elevation non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Differentiating ACS noncardiac chest pain remain challenge emergency department ( ED ) . Myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) ischemia use rule ACS among chest pain patient nondiagnostic ECGs upon presentation ED . Several study show high negative predictive value MPI rule acute ischemia emergency set . Although myocardial image perfusion agent provide important information risk-stratifying stable post-ACS patient , method limit value patient prior history CAD , since patient often abnormal rest perfusion pattern , thereby preclude ability differentiate old infarcts new ischemic event . 99mTc-glucarate detect old MIs thus provide improvement specificity image ACS patient previous CAD . This study propose extend evaluation 99mTc-glucarate image study ability detect ACS chest pain patient obvious sign AMI know CAD , set ED . Unlike MPI , 99mTc-glucarate imaging detect old MIs , thereby provide advantage specificity technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chest pain recent onset ( le 24 hour ) great 5minute duration , consistent ACS ; History CAD ; Creatinine level le 3.5 mg per deciliter ; Female patient : surgically sterile ( hysterectomy bilateral tubule libation ) , least one year postmenopausal , negative pregnancy test day treatment ; Written inform consent . This research support NIH/NHLBI require minimum 50 % participation woman . Efforts make enroll equal number men woman clinical site . ECG change diagnostic AMI ; A cardiac revascularization procedure within last 2 week ( nonrevascularization procedure cardiac catheterization , stress test echocardiography acceptable ) ; An alternate diagnosis probable ACS ; Presence pericarditis , myocarditis , acute aortic dissection , pneumothorax , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) ; Patients uncontrolled severe heart failure time enrollment ( NYHA class III IV ) . Other serious lifethreatening disease might preclude subject complete study ; Clinically essential procedure protocol may interfere ; Previous 99mTcbased diagnostic test within last 24 hour ; Female subject pregnant lactating ;</criteria>
