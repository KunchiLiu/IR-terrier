	<brief_summary>Loss muscle mass body protein main cause fatigue bowel surgery , may result long hospital stay high rate complication . This particularly applies malnourish patient cancer undergo surgery less muscle protein reserve patient well-nourished . Anesthesiologists favourably influence undesirable consequence surgery choose type pain treatment , i.e . analgesia . Our group recently observe pain treatment epidural catheter ( place call epidural space , lie spine skin back ) , contrast conventional use intravenous morphine , prevent loss body protein surgery . The goal present research program study whether protein spar effect epidural analgesia augment feed patient intravenously glucose protein start day prior surgery . We believe new concept avoid increase protein loss surgery , also help patient build new protein need fight stress cause operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major objective nutritional management surgical patient accelerate wound heal increase resistance infection prevent wastage functional structural protein . Parenteral nutrition represent useful strategy achieve goal , particularly patient undergo major abdominal procedure temporary intolerance oral feeding . At present administration large , hypercaloric amount glucose together amino acid nutritional modality establish positive protein balance ( anabolism ) surgery . The fact hyperalimentation require central venous cannulation , cause hyperglycemia associate increased morbidity impediment routine use . Attempts induce anabolism diminish glucose load iso- hypocaloric quantity fail - failure control type quality perioperative analgesia - inadequate assessment patient ` catabolic status prior surgery subsequent - lack individualization energy substrate supply . We recently demonstrate segmental pain relief epidural analgesia facilitates oxidative glucose utilization thereby decrease amount glucose necessary attenuate protein loss surgery . Hypocaloric glucose epidural analgesia prevent postoperative increase protein oxidation , preoperative fasting avoid , i.e . glucose infusion start 24 hour surgery . We also show patient epidural analgesia could render anabolic short term administration glucose amino acid . Based finding anti-catabolic anabolic effect epidural analgesia presence energy substrate supply propose epidural analgesia hypocaloric parenteral nutrition initiate 24 hour colorectal surgery produce positive postoperative protein balance include great muscle protein synthesis initiate skin incision . In order test validity assumption , patient schedule elective colorectal cancer surgery randomly assign `` early '' `` late '' feed protocol . `` Early '' nutrition start 24 hour prior surgery , `` late '' nutrition commence surgical skin incision . Nutrition adjust provide 50 % patient ` actual energy expenditure glucose 20 % amino acid . The stable isotope tracer L- [ 1-13C ] leucine apply assess whole body protein breakdown , amino acid oxidation protein synthesis . A positive protein balance ( difference protein synthesis protein breakdown ) use indicator anabolism . Because whole body protein kinetics provide insight metabolic process organ level ( muscle , liver ) , fractional synthesis rate albumin , fibrinogen muscle protein also determine surgery . The demonstration anabolic effect epidural analgesia nutrition less half commonly use energy would valuable practical application . If nutrient load decrease , use make peripheral vein hyperglycemia avoid , thus make nutritional therapy efficacious , safer available patient .</detailed_description>
