	<detailed_description>Background study : Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) increase Netherlands . The incidence COPD 2-3 per 1000 prevalence 12-19 per 1000 patient Dutch primary health care . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) state prevalence 2020 fourth rank death fifth rank cause disability-adjusted life year lose worldwide . COPD characterize deterioration lung function , lower physical activity level low state quality life . Objective study : The aim study investigate effect structure lifestyle program ( first , second third echelon ) physical activity level COPD patient Study design : It concern randomize control study . In study structured lifestyle program compare usual care first , second third echelon health care . Study population : 150 COPD patient ( GOLD I-IV ) include , age 40 80 year . In echelon 25 patient participate structured lifestyle program 25 patient treat usual care . Intervention : A structured lifestyle program , base COACH method , use . This method develop Institute Human Movement Sciences University Groningen ( RUG ) . Using COACH , patient stimulate individually enhance physically active lifestyle . Primary study parameters/outcome study : Daily physical activity ( steps/ day ) Secondary study parameters/outcome study : Personal characteristic , Body Mass Index , Fat Free Mass , lung function ( FEV1 ) , physical fitness ( arm strength , leg strength , respiratory muscle strength , 6MWT ) , COPD related cost , ADL activity , type activity , attitude towards physical activity , health status , physical fitness , psychological factor ( self-efficacy , depression ) , quality life , fatigue . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : According study protocol patient experimental group control group participate five measurement session . In assessment physical fitness test , lung function , questionnaires take . Al participant wear pedometer registrate number step day 2 week appointment . Patients experimental group participate five individual counseling session one telephonic counseling . As result type assessment use , study low risk profile .</detailed_description>
