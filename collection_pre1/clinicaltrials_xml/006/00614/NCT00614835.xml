	<brief_summary>This pilot study adjuvant therapy patient leiomyosarcoma uterus completely remove surgery . `` Adjuvant '' therapy mean tumor ( leiomyosarcoma ) completely remove surgery ; thus , give treatment do hop decrease chance tumor come back ( relapse recur ) . The main goal study show series treatment safe patient type tumor . In trial get drug approve use type cancer . In study wish see whether combination two chemotherapy drug , docetaxel gemcitabine decrease chance tumor , leiomyosarcoma uterus , come back ( relapse ) . We also look short-term side effect risk drug give combination patient leiomyosarcoma completely resect ( remove surgery ) . The combination gemcitabine docetaxel show safe , show decrease size leiomyosarcoma tumor patient leiomyosarcoma uterus relapse , continue grow despite treatment chemotherapy drug .</brief_summary>
