	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To compare disease-free survival amongst patient undergo total laparoscopic ( TLRH ) robotic radical hysterectomy ( TRRH ) verse undergo total abdominal radical hysterectomy ( TARH ) early stage cervical cancer . Secondary Objectives : - Compare pattern recurrence arm . - Compare treatment-associated morbidity within 6 month surgery . - Compare cost effectiveness TLRH/TRRH versus TARH - Compare impact Quality Life ( QOL ) arm . - Assess pelvic floor function - Compare overall survival arm - Determine feasibility sentinel lymph node biopsy group patient RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN Total abdominal radical hysterectomy ( TARH ) pelvic lymph node dissection ( ± aortic lymph node dissection ± postoperative [ chemo- ] radiotherapy ) current standard treatment early cervical cancer . While accepted effective treatment , laparotomy highly invasive , visibly scar associate tissue trauma , blood loss significant risk wound infectious adverse event . Additionally , radical hysterectomy laparotomy associate average hospital stay approximately 5 7 day average recovery period ( surgery ) 5 6 week . Laparoscopic technique demonstrate feasible safe previous retrospective study TLH show encouraging result . In number retrospective prospective , non-controlled series incidence treatment-related morbidity less patient laparoscopic hysterectomy compare patient underwent TAH . Retrospective data suggest recurrence rate pattern recurrence similar patient laparoscopic open approach . Treatment recommendation ideally base prospective , randomized trial compare current standard technique ( TARH ) propose good technique ( TLRH ) . However , currently prospective study available directly compare TLRH standard treatment TARH regard disease-free overall survival . The proposed clinical trial biphasic . The primary outcome variable stage 1 feasibility recruitment determine overall trial recruitment . Following completion Stage 1 , data study become basis assess recurrence disease-free survival Stage 2 design . RATIONALE FOR THE QUALITY OF LIFE Retrospective study suggest equivalency laparoscopic open approach radical hysterectomy regard surgical specimen obtain likely disease-free overall survival . Thus , quality life could see one significant factor recommend one approach therefore extremely important endpoint protocol . In GOG LAP-2 protocol , trial evaluate comparison hysterectomy laparotomy laparoscopy , investigator find equivalency adequacy two surgical approach however significant difference short term quality life favor laparoscopy . As expect , patient underwent laparoscopy fast return baseline functioning compare patient undergone laparotomy translate improve short-term quality life . By 6 month , however , patient cohort report equivalent quality life parameter . Quality life survey employ Phase III clinical trial encompass important endpoint postoperative pain relate symptom use MD Anderson Symptom Assessment Index ( MDSAI ) , well cancer specific Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT-Cx ) general 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey ( SF-12 ) . RATIONALE FOR LYMPHATIC MAPPING Published experience technique lymphatic mapping sentinel lymph node detection woman cervical cancer limit . To date , single study enrol 100 patient undergoing lymphatic mapping part surgical treatment cervical cancer . In fact , majority study report less 50 patient . In addition , procedure yet show viable multi-institutional setting . The limitation previously publish report important technique associate significantly high learn curve early procedure less successful later one . This study provide u opportunity enroll large number patient validation intraoperative lymphatic mapping woman cervical cancer international , multi-institutional setting .</detailed_description>
