	<detailed_description>There several study link hyperglycemia pregnancy adverse perinatal outcome macrosomia , fetal cardiac defect , shoulder dystocia . However , study address effect hypoglycemia perinatal outcome . Several study show increased risk intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) maternal hypoglycemia particularly glucose tolerance test ( GTT ) .3-6 However , many study take account comorbid factor conflict findings.3-6 IUGR define infant birth weight tenth percentile baby otherwise genetically normal . The purpose retrospective pilot study ass association maternal hypoglycemia one hour glucose tolerance test decrease placental weight identifiable placental pathology . We hypothesize decreased one hour glucose tolerance test risk factor decrease placental weight , increase fetal placental weight ratio , identifiable placental pathology . Abell et al . find maternal hypoglycemia one hour GTT associate decreased birth weight intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) . However , study make comment effect confound factor tobacco use , history gestational diabetes , maternal BMI . Both Sokol et al Langer et al reveal link decrease maternal response third trimester GTT IUGR , although Sokol study , pregnancy one know risk factor gestational diabetes . Conversely , several recent paper report maternal hypoglycemia predictive IUGR poor perinatal outcome . -8 Consequently , effect maternal hypoglycemia oral GTT unclear . The placenta view reflection intrauterine environment pregnancy . Therefore , wish examine hypoglycemia oral one hour GTT risk factor decrease placental weight , increase fetal weight placental weight ratio , increase incidence abnormal placental pathology . A normal term placenta weigh approximately 450 gram , average , one sixth fetal weight.9 Increased maternal substrate availability vital fetal nutrient , glucose , know result large gestational age infant , occur gestational diabetics.10 This may also reflect increased placental weight link large gestational age infants.11 Conversely , IUGR small gestational age infant may decrease placental weight , possibly due decrease substrate availability secondary maternal hypoglycemia . 12 Increased fetal placental weight ratio 1.5 great average value particular gestational age also indicative IUGR infant . Identifying possible indicator increase risk decrease placental weight , may turn indicate increase risk IUGR , vitally important consider outcome IUGR infant . These infant great risk hypoglycemia , sepsis , seizure , stillbirth , respiratory distress , meconium aspiration . Long term outcome include poor school performance , hyperactivity , hypertension , cardiovascular disease.2 Study Population Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Our study population consist woman young 35 , deliver term infant either vaginal delivery cesarean section Tulsa Regional Medical Center July 1 , 2005 July 31 , 2007 . This time range select order adequate number recent chart review . ( Women 35 old consider `` advanced maternal age '' may increase risk placental pathology reason , exclude . ) We expect collect approximately 350 usable chart , perhaps 35 patient blood sugar `` low '' experimental category . A power analysis use assumption provide end protocol . All placentas send pathology routine basis . A term infant define delivery 37 week great . The study population consist typical resident clinic patient population OSU OB-Gyn clinic . The ethnicity study population include African-American , Caucasian , Hispanic , American Indian , Asian woman . The population include study must one hour glucose tolerance test result equal less 88 mg/dl . These result equal range fifth percentile less.3 We use 50 gram oral glucola 24 week great glucose tolerance test . We exclude woman follow comorbid condition , due fact condition manifest placental pathology may affect placental weight : insufficient gestational date , multiple gestation , hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism , heart disease , tobacco use , drug use , history current gestational diabetes , history IUGR , chromosomal abnormality , congenital malformation , preexist diabetes , autoimmune disease , hypertensive disorder , abnormal maternal screen , pulmonary disease , previous gastric bypass , disease process result decrease gastrointestinal absorption , HIV , intrauterine amniotic infection , history placental abruption , thrombophilia , body mass index ( BMI ) great 40 BMI less 19.8.13 Early Termination Criteria N/A Methods/Procedures Diagnosis The diagnosis maternal hypoglycemia one hour glucola screen define one hour plasma glucose measurement equal less 88 mg/dl . The glucose screen perform 24 week gestation great , calculate last menstrual period ultrasound . The one hour GTT result obtain patient 's chart . A decreased placental weight define weight equal one standard deviation mean placental weight accord gestational age ( Table 1 ) . The control group population one hour GTT result great 88mg/dl . In study , assess placental weight , birth weight , placenta birth weight ratio , placental pathology describe Table 2 . All placental finding assess single pathologist blind patient 's one hour GTT result . Data Collection The collaborating investigator research assistant collect age , height , weight initial visit , date delivery , infant birth weight , one hour GTT result , smoke drug use status , placental weight pathology result , mention exclusion criterion patient chart . ( Height weight need calculate BMI . ) Research assistant utilized aid collection data clinic hospital record . These assistant OSU medical student employ work study program basic human research HIPAA training . Analysis The two population compare various response variable . Whenever response variable meaningfully numeric continuous nature , two population t-tests use compare mean two group . When response categorical nature , contingency table create Chi Squares test utilized compare proportion responses two group . All analysis conduct use PC SAS Version 9 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Confidentiality The record review kept Houston Park medical record department Tulsa Regional Medical Center health information management department . Both facility lock security supervision time . All study record de-identified conversion number review , analysis , interpretation . J. Martin Beal , D.O. , Sarah McCoy , Ph.D. , Elsa Vadakekut , D.O . access number keep locked OSU Ob/Gyn office , separate medical record department . All document link patient name chart destroy data collection complete .</detailed_description>
