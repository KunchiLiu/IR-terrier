	<detailed_description>The introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) child adolescent result improved control viral replication prolong period time significant reduction morbidity . However , compare response see adult , child overall inferior virologic response . The therapeutic vaccine , DermaVir , represent immunization strategy target lymph node dendritic cell . Because high percentage naive CD4 cell child adolescent , potential effective new HIV-specific CD4 cell response may achievable child adult . The primary purpose study evaluate safety tolerability DermaVir child young adult . This study last 61 week ( 13 week treatment additional 48 week follow-up ) . Participants randomly stratify accord age dosage . Group 1 consist 8 adolescent young adult ( age 13 23 ) 8 child ( age 6 12 ) . Group 1 participant one 0.8 ml DermaVir patch one control patch apply Days 0 , 42 , 84 . Group 2 consist 4 adolescent young adult 4 child . Group 2 participant four 0.8 ml DermaVir patch apply Days 0 , 42 , 84 . Group 3 consist 4 adolescent young adult 4 child . Group 3 participant four 0.8 ml DermaVir patch apply Days 0 , 7 , 42 , 49 , 84 , 91 . There 14 study visit participant . They occur screen Days 0 , 7 , 21 , 42 , 49 , 63 , 84 , 91 , 105 , 126 , 168 , 259 , 427 . Screening occur 30 day first vaccination ( Day 0 ) . Medical history physical exam occur visit .
