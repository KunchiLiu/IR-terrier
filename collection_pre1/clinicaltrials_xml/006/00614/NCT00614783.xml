	<brief_summary>This pivotal study determine accuracy new device ( SCOUT ) screen person pre-diabetes diabetes . SCOUT compare standard screen test ( Fasting Plasma Glucose ) , use Oral Glucose Tolerance Test reference standard . SCOUT use rapid , noninvasive , light-based technology measure concentration chemical skin call advanced glycation endproducts ( AGEs ) . Several study demonstrate AGEs accumulate skin faster individual poor control blood sugar . Persons eligible study 'at risk ' diabetes base age risk factor define American Diabetes Association .</brief_summary>
