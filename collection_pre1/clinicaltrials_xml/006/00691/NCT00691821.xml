	<brief_title>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Treatment Chronic Pressure Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee recommend study complete due large number patient need chronic wound care increase use NPWT base poor quality evidence identify potential indication use NPWT . This study design provide evidence regard NPWT compare standard dress regimen Ontario result serve benchmark utilization NPWT chronic pressure wound , establish provide guidance regard use NPWT population subject support policy decision make regard funding NPWT province . Specifically , compare efficacy , effectiveness cost-effectiveness NPWT standard dress regimen treatment chronic pressure ulcer pelvic region . This prospective , randomize , open-label , control clinical trial compare standardize wound dress ( control arm ) NPWT ( experimental arm ) treatment chronic pressure wound pelvic region . NPWT perform use Vacuum-Assisted Closure System ( V.A.C.® Therapy™ , KCI Medical Canada Inc. , Mississauga , Ontario ) . NPWT compare present recommend state art wound dressing subject would candidate either type wound therapy . Both arm receive standard wound care ( e.g. , debridement , preventative care , infection control , etc. ) . The efficacy , effectiveness , safety , quality life evaluate standardized wound dress versus NPWT . Complications associate either form wound care document . An economic evaluation conduct order assess cost-effectiveness cost-utility NPWT compare standard wound dressing . It anticipate 184 subject enrol randomize 1.5 year period . All subject provide consent meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize either treatment arm follow 12 week . Patients wound closure within 12-week study period continue wound care visit schedule . All subject Wound Evaluation Visits Wound Dressing Change Visits . Wound Evaluation Visits occur baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 12 week date randomization , follow removal dressing , detail wound assessment ( e.g. , wound characteristic , measurement ) do healthcare resource utilization collect . Disease specific quality life measure preference base quality life measure ( EQ-5D ) collect baseline , 6 week 12 week . Dressing Change Visits occur clinically required frequency dress change per week allow vary 12 week study . During dress change visit , subject monitor wound infection complication . Subjects may enrol randomized clinic transfer community continue follow-up complete appropriate Community Care Access Centre .</detailed_description>

Chronic osteomyelitis ( determined biopsy ) osteomyelitis treatable debridement antibiotic 5 . Nonenteric unexplored fistulae 6 . Wounds require hemostasis ( i.e. , flow blood stop ) local bleed 7 . Alternate etiology nonhealing 8 . Concomitant condition judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study ( e.g. , malignancy wound , malignancy le 1year disease free interval , previous current irradiation , know immunodeficiency and/or major uncorrected medical disorder serious nonmalignant disease , serious cardiovascular pulmonary disease , lupus , inflammatory bowel disease , palliative care sickle cell disease ) 9 . Poor nutritional status determine Braden Scale Nutritional Assessment score 2 1 serum albumin &lt; 25 g/L hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L 10 . Currently take medication may interfere wound healing ( e.g. , oral systemic steroid , immunosuppressive drug , unfractionated heparin infusion ) 11 .
