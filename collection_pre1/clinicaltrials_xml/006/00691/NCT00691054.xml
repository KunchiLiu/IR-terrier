	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation work treat patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer respond first-line therapy gemcitabine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer That Did Not Respond First-Line Therapy With Gemcitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To establish preliminary evidence efficacy paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation patient locally advance ( unresectable ) metastatic pancreatic cancer fail first-line therapy gemcitabine hydrochloride-containing regimen . Secondary - To determine safety characterize toxicity profile drug . - To determine complete , partial , overall response rate duration response patient measurable disease . - To determine CA 19-9 response . - To determine progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
