	<brief_summary>Epidural analgesia widely regard effective analgesic strategy labor pain . Modern practice utilize dilute local anesthetic continuous infusion along opioid , e.g. , common `` recipe '' 12 ml/hr 0.0625 % bupivacaine 2 micrograms/ml fentanyl , initial dose maintain patient comfort delivery . This dose infusion often provide adequate comfort without interfere mobility patient ability effectively push delivery . However , low dose epidural infusion strategy often result recurrence pain initial pain free period . This breakthrough pain treat administer small bolus analgesic via epidural catheter . The pain occur labor initially visceral origin mediate pain fiber originate low thoracic upper lumbar segment spinal cord . As labor progress late first phase ( also know transitional stage ) , pain sensation originate distension pelvic floor , vagina perineum add somatic component labor pain . This type breakthrough pain often difficult treat . Although request patient alleviate late stage breakthrough pain common , one know effective strategy pain management stage labor . This study design compare efficacy two treatment control late first stage breakthrough pain labor epidural infusion place : clonidine-bupivacaine versus fentanyl-bupivacaine . Women labor epidural analgesia place enrol randomized present breakthrough pain late first stage second stage labor ( â‰¥ 8 cm dilate ) . They receive 8 ml solution contain 10 mg bupivacaine 75 microgram either fentanyl ( opioid `` narcotic '' ) clonidine ( `` alpha-2 agonist know effective epidural analgesic ) . Pain relief , labor progress outcome assess compare fentanyl versus clonidine . It hypothesis study clonidine add bupivacaine well analgesic fentanyl add bupivacaine breakthrough pain advance labor .</brief_summary>
