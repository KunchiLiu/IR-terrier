	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , clofarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving clofarabine together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose clofarabine give together rituximab see well work treat patient relapse B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Rituximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose clofarabine adult patient relapse CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . - To estimate objective response rate clofarabine combination rituximab patient . Secondary - To determine 1-year progression-free survival regimen use mean tolerate dose patient . - To determine safety efficacy regimen patient . - To determine clofarabine act inhibitor DNA methylation similar cladribine perform scientific correlate . - To determine whether response clofarabine alone combination rituximab correlate change global serum DNA methylation index . - To identify gene activated clofarabine therapy use genomic DNA RNA array technology . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study clofarabine follow phase II study . Patients receive oral clofarabine daily day 1-14 course rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course one day 1 course 2-8 . Courses repeat every 4 week . After 2 course therapy , patient eligible stem cell transplantation may either undergo transplantation continue receive study drug disease progression unacceptable toxicity total 8 course treatment . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically correlative study . Samples analyze identify global DNA methylation difference correlate change methylation index ( MI ) patient outcome treatment clofarabine without rituximab via high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) ; determine difference gene expression via microarray analysis micro-RNA ( miRNA ) expression via quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) patient high compare low global DNA methylation index miRNA expression CD5+ B-lymphocytes obtain pediatric tonsil B-lymphocytes 5 healthy control ; determine gene expression miRNA profile patient treatment clofarabine without rituximab via genomic DNA array . After completion study treatment , patient follow year 2 year .</detailed_description>
