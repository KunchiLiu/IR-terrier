	<criteria>Adult men woman 18 50 year age . Diagnosis moderate severe atopic dermatitis confirm publish consensus diagnostic criteria26 ( except healthy control subject ) . Severity base investigator 's global assessment score moderate severe ( IGA ) ( see Appendix 1 ) . Subjects must general good health skin disease , disease state physical condition would impair evaluation skin would increase health risk study participation determine investigator . Women child bear potential require negative pregnancy test order enroll study require maintain adequate birth control throughout study . Reliable method birth control : abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , DepoProvera , Norplant , tubal ligation , vasectomy partner ( confirm negative sperm count ) monogamous relationship . An acceptable , although less reliable , method involves careful use condom spermicidal foam gel and/or cervical cap sponge . Subjects must cease use topical agent forearm experimental data go collect least 1 week prior . Topical agent use part body . Subjects require cease use oral antihistamine period one week prior study visit . Adults age 50 . Children le 18 year age . Unable complete require measure . Diagnosis disease would affect measurement heart rate variability determine investigator cardiovascular disease , hypertension , bradycardia ( &lt; 60 beat per minute ) tachycardia ( &gt; 100 beat per minute ) amongst others . Diagnosis skin disease would affect measurement transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) skin hydration determine investigator . Currently enrol investigational study subject receive type drug , biologic , nondrug therapy subject undergoing treatment another investigational drug approve therapy investigational use within 28 day prior study participation . Consistent consumption 4 caffeinated beverage per day . Current treatment oral lipophilic beta blocker , antihistamine , opioids , glucocorticoid , theophylline , anticholinergic medication inhale betaagonists anticholinergic medication know interfere autonomic nervous system physiology . Asthma/Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease respiratory disease . Neuropathy cause disease uremia . Uncontrolled thyroid disease . Diabetes mellitus . Use illicit drug .
