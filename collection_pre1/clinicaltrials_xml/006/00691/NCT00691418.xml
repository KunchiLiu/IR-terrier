	<brief_title>Docosahexaenoic Acid ( DHA ) Administration Length Gestation : Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct 18-month feasibility study determine ( ) many woman could approach 4-month period , ( b ) many woman would eligible future RCT , ( c ) many would consent participate RCT , ( ) many would subsequently render ineligible due poor compliance . Women enrol 4-month recruitment period would follow 1 month delivery use telephone contact ( assess compliance ) scan KPMCP electronic database ( quantify outcomes ) . We hope enroll 50 75 woman fix time ( 4 month ) recruitment period . Half 50-75 woman would receive DHA ; half would receive placebo . We identify potential subject base response Preterm Birth Prevention Program questionnaire ( screen instrument administer Regional Perinatal Service Center [ RPSC ] woman KPMCP enter prenatal care ) . Eligible woman pregnant woman enter prenatal care , base response abovementioned RPSC questionnaire , identify previous preterm delivery ( delivery prior 37 complete week gestation ) .
