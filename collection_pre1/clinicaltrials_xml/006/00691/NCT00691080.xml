	<brief_summary>The investigator examine whether sleep problem child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) relate alteration production melatonin ( MT ) , hormone play important role regulate sleep-wake cycle . Children ASD experience high rate sleep disturbance potentially contribute problem think behavior . It unclear change MT production cause sleep problem child ASD . MT frequently use treat sleep problem ; however , well establish whether MT effective treatment . Our hypothesis concern MT child ASD sleep problem delay sleep-wake cycle and/or decrease MT production . This study compare child diagnose ASD `` healthy '' control child ASD diagnosis . All subject recruit one three site : Baylor College Medicine , Oregon Health &amp; Science University Columbia University . The investigator use standardized questionnaire determine whether child sleep problem . The investigator measure MT level saliva ASD child sleep problem group control child without sleep problem . Total 24-hour MT production determine urine sample two group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal study relationship melatonin ( MT ) sleep problem child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , part collaborative research structure Autism Treatment Network ( ATN ) . A major goal ATN conduct clinical research significant impact daily life function individual ASD address immediate concern parent . Children ASD experience high rate sleep disturbance , likely contribute severity daytime cognitive behavioral dysfunction poorer quality life family . As step toward address sleep problem ASD , propose test hypothesis child ASD sleep problem delay MT onset and/or decreased MT secretion 24 hour compare normal control . Primary endpoint : Characterize endogenous MT profile child ASD : We predict result study reveal low level metabolize MT child ASD compare normal child . In addition , anticipate child ASD delay MT onset alter circadian phase . Data study provide important information concern circadian rhythm dysregulation ASD support development future study use MT modify correct abnormal circadian rhythm .</detailed_description>
