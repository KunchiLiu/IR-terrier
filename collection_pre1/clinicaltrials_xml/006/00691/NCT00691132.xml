	<brief_title>Phenethyl Isothiocyanate Preventing Lung Cancer Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether oral phenethyl isothiocyanate ( PEITC ) affect urinary level biomarkers 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -1-butanone ( NNK ) metabolism current smoker . Secondary - To determine effect GSTM1 genotype PEITC 's impact urinary biomarkers NNK metabolism . - To determine effect GSTM1 genotype metabolism excretion PEITC measure urinary level major metabolite . - To determine whether oral PEITC affect molecular marker cell proliferation ( Ki-67 ) apoptosis ( caspase-3 TUNEL ) bronchial tissue . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord GST genotype ( GSTM1 null-null genotype v GSTM1-positive genotype ) . All participant initially enrol short-term trial . After completion short-term trial , participant meet certain criterion may proceed long-term trial . - Short-term trial : Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Participants ask smoke deuterated NNK cigarette ( provide study ) record exact number cigarette smoke alcoholic drink consume day 1 month . Participants receive oral phenethyl isothiocyanate ( PEITC ) four time daily 5 day week 2 oral placebo four time daily 5 day week 4 . Participants keep diary food beverage consume day PEITC placebo take . - Arm II : Participants receive oral placebo four time daily 5 day week 2 oral PEITC four time daily 5 day week 4 . Participants also ask smoke deuterated NNK cigarette , record number cigarette smoke alcoholic drink consume day , keep food beverage diary arm I . After completion short-term trial , participant undergo wash-out period 1 month ask resume smoke regular cigarette . Participants offer smoke cessation assistance , desire . Only participants meeting certain criterion may proceed long-term trial 1-month wash-out period . - Long-term trial : Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Participants receive oral PEITC twice daily 12 month . - Arm II : Participants receive oral placebo twice daily 12 month . Participants arm complete 3-day food diary monthly 12 month food-frequency questionnaire baseline completion study treatment . All participant undergo blood urine sample collection periodically laboratory study . Participants enrol long-term trial also undergo bronchoscopy tissue biopsy baseline completion study treatment . Urine sample examine liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-ESI-MS/MS ) various biomarkers . Tissue sample examine IHC Ki-67 , TUNEL , caspase-3 expression .</detailed_description>
