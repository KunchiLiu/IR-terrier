	<brief_title>Classic Total Thyroidectomy With Without Drains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 INTRODUCTION Classic article Kocher , Halsted , Lahey , Crile Riddell provide surgeon principle significantly reduce operative morbidity mortality total thyroidectomy ( TT ) . Nowadays , surgery thyroid gland consider safe practically null mortality . Morbidity , although infrequent , still reason concern . The complication directly attribute TT hypoparathyroidism , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , hemorrhage , oesophageal perforation trachea instability perforation . Furthermore , complication , related surgical technique , seroma wound infection , may also occur . Several technique employ order resect suffer thyroid gland . Classic TT consider today , golden standard total thyroid resection . This protocol design compare data regard TT drain versus TT without drain . 2.0 OBJECTIVES To compare postoperative course complication patient undergo two technique . 3.0 DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION The study design prospective randomize single center study . Any patient schedule total thyroidectomy offer participation study . The study conduct 100 patient treat ( 50 patient group ) . It estimate take 6 month enroll patient additional 7 day obtain follow-up information 4.0 STUDY PROCEDURE 4.1 Pre-Surgery Procedures preform routine hospital examination , antibiotic prophylactic treatment , anticoagulant treatment diet accord standard management protocol record study . The following pre-surgery information record : 1 . Demographic information include : name , age , gender , ethnicity 2 . Height , weight , BMI ASA status 3 . Behavioral history ( Smoking , alcohol drug use ) 4 . Preoperative lab ( WBC , Ht , Hgb , SGOT , SGPT , LDH , Glc , Ure , Cre , K+ , Na+ , Ca2+ , Mg2+ , TP , ALB , fT3 , fT4 , TSH , PTH , PT , aPTT , INR ) 5 . Diagnosis include clinical observation previous image result 6 . FNA result ( ) 7 . Medications 8 . Current past history surgical medical comorbidities 9 . Vocal cord assessment indirect laryngoscopy 4.2 Intra-operative The surgeon perform preplanned operation . The following intraoperative variable record patient : 1 . Surgery date 2 . Left laryngeal nerve activity 3 . Right laryngeal nerve activity 4 . Method devascularization right lobe 5 . Method devascularization leave lobe 6 . Technical complication 7 . Estimated blood loss 8 . Duration surgery 9 . Difficulty operation ( 1=very difficult 5=very easy ) 10 . Operation perform 11 . Procedure related comment 12 . Usage drain ( number type ) 13 . Usage haemostatic material 14 . Length incision 4.3 Pathology data form The following pathology data record patient : 1 . Post-operative diagnosis include pathology report 2 . Weight gland 3 . Dimensions gland 4.4 Postoperative follow-up Follow-up evaluation perform hospitalization , 3rd 6th month . The following information record : 1 . Wound condition 2 . Average Pain score patient rest moving/day 3 . Postoperative lab ( WBC , Ht , Hgb , SGOT , SGPT , LDH , Glc , Ure , Cre , K+ , Na+ , Ca2+ , Mg2+ , TP , ALB , fT3 , fT4 , TSH , PTH , PT , aPTT , INR ) 4 . Sign hypoparathyroidism ( Chvostek Trousseau ) 5 . Vocal alteration patient ( voice completely altered=10 voice altered=1 ) 6 . Vocal cord assessment indirect laryngoscopy 7 . Comments 5.0 COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS The investigator require notify coordinator serious adverse event . The coordinator also require notify Ethics Committee accord local regulation requirement . Serious Adverse Events include : 1 . Death regardless cause 2 . Any-life-threatening event 3 . Any hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization 4 . Any event result persistent significant disability incapacity patient . 6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The objective study compare TT technique concern immediate postoperative course patient relation complication post procedure . Statistical analysis include description intraoperative postoperative outcome , indication patient characteristic associate outcomes . In order efficiently compare two technique random allocation patient within two group ( Group A=TT drain Group B=TT without drain ) employ . All patient even number include group A , patient odd number include group B . Since study pre-specified hypothesis statistical analysis exploratory interpretation result within context . 7.0 DATA MONITORING PLAN The coordinator monitor data accrual . Furthermore , coordinator review progress clinical trial include safety data ensure possible conduct , record report accordance protocol , good clinical practice applicable regulatory requirement . 8.0 DATA CONFIDENTIALITY Each patient ill identify his/her initial unique patient identification number . Source data store source document . Only personnel responsible collect data transcribe case report form access data . Records remain site secure area . 10.0 ETHICS Prior study institution review board ( IRB ) approval obtain . Any change study protocol , informed consent form , investigator must re-approved IRB . All patient enrol study provide consent prior enter study . An informed consent form shall sign dated patient . The investigator retain form part study record . This study execute accordance Declaration Helsinki , agreement guideline conduct clinical investigation accordance principle ICH GCP outline E6 document . By sign present protocol , participant study commit carry accordance local legal requirement . 11.0 INFORMED CONSENT All eligible patient capacity provide inform consent . The described inclusion exclusion criterion design ensure entry appropriate population patient study approve local IRB . Screening criterion conduct coordinator . Eligible patient educate research proposal study investigator . To determine whether patient understood issue , he/she ask describe research entail whether question . All question address prior enrollment . The patient refuse participation study time . A write informed consent form generate . For patient , case report form ( CRF ) complete , provide general medical information history .</detailed_description>
