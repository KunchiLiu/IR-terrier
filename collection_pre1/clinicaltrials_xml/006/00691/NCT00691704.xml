	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness induction therapy lenalidomide low dose dexamethasone follow sequential low dose bortezomib follow low dose Melphalan Prednisone , follow low dose lenalidomide multiple cycle subject high risk Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) . The primary objective evaluate efficacy measure progression free survival ( PFS ) 2 year low dose sequential therapy follow four cycle induction therapy lenalidomide/low-dose dexamethasone subject symptomatic high risk multiple myeloma , receive prior treatment . A total 35 subject estimate accrued Phase II trial period subject still progression-free 2 year . Two year measure date registration trial . Progression include disease progression ( DP ) well death due cause . Data analyze report PI 1 2 year initiation study . All subsequent data collect may analyze report follow-up clinical report . The PI independent reviewer meet review efficacy safety data determine risk/benefit analysis subject population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : A total 35 subject newly diagnose , high risk Multiple Myeloma ( high risk define presence one following : ( 4 ; 14 ) , ( 14 ; 16 ) , deletion 17p13 ( p53 ) FISH , deletion chromosome 13 aneuploidy metaphase analysis ) estimate accrued Phase II trial period 3 year . The primary objective estimate proportion subject still progression-free 2 year . Two year measure date registration trial . Progression include disease progression well death due cause . Time response , define responder , define time date initiation treatment first documentation confirm response . Duration response among subject achieve sustain complete response ( sCR ) , complete response ( CR ) , good partial response ( VGPR ) partial response ( PR ) define length interval initial PR time disease progression . Progression free survival ( PFS ) define subject time date initiation treatment date first documentation relapse , progression , death due cause . Time progression ( TTP ) define subject time initiation treatment disease progression death owe cause progression count event , censor ( Durie et al. , 2006 ) . Overall survival ( OS ) define time date initiation treatment date death due cause . The Garban et al . trial find 2-year progression-free rate 0.60 212 similar subject . If 2-year rate 0.60 observe trial , would consider treatment success . A rate 0.60 exact 80 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.48 - 0.71 . True 2-year Probability observe Progression-free rate ≥ 0.60 0.48 0.11 0.52 0.22 0.56 0.38 0.60 0.57 0.64 0.75 0.68 0.88 0.72 0.95 DOSING REGIMEN ( S ) : Induction therapy : Lenalidomide 25 mg daily Days 1-21 follow 7 day rest Dexamethasone 40 mg mouth ( po ) daily Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 every 28 day 4 cycle . Subjects receive 325 mg aspirin deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis . Following induction therapy : Stem cell collection cryopreservation - Subjects achieve sCR , CR , VGPR PR , eligible future stem cell transplant procedure . Maintenance sequential therapy - Subjects achieve &gt; PR follow induction therapy receive repeat triplet cycle alternate low dose therapy : - Subjects receive 325 mg aspirin DVT prophylaxis . - Cycle 1 , 4 , 7 , etc - bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 day 1 8 28-day cycle - Cycle 2 , 5 , 8 etc- Melphalan 6 mg/m2 po daily Days 1-7 day Prednisone 60 mg/m2 po daily Days 1-7 28-day cycle - Cycle 3 , 6 , 9 , etc . Lenalidomide 10 mg po daily Days 1-21 28 day cycle . Subjects continue sequential alternate triplet cycle time progression discontinuation due poor tolerance toxicity . Subjects complete 24 month maintenance therapy remove study . Subjects achieve &gt; stable disease ( SD ) maintenance may continue long 24 month discussion physician . Efficacy/response assessment ( include skeletal survey , quantification M-protein , immunoglobulins , bone marrow aspiration , biopsy &amp; morphology , serum free-light chain assay , immunofixation serum &amp; urine ) schedule occur within 7 day completion Cycle 2 4 induction every third cycle maintenance start end Cycle 3 ( +/- 14 day ) . Efficacy assessment also do discontinuation . Subjects assess disease response accord modify updated European Group Blood Bone marrow Transplant ( EBMT ) criterion ( Durie 2006 , Blade 1998 ) . Response category list Appendix 15.3 . Data subject receive study drug include safety analysis . Subjects enter study take study drug confirm , evaluate safety . The severity toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute 's ( NCI ) common terminology criterion adverse event ( CTCAE ) v3.0 . Safety evaluation base incidence , intensity type adverse event : Karnofsky performance score ( KPS ) clinically significant change subject 's physical examination finding , vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory result . Exposure study drug reason discontinuation study treatment tabulate . Analyses : The proportion subject progression-free time full restaging ( i.e. , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 month ) calculate 80 % confidence interval descriptively compare rate Garban et al . paper . Time-to-progression ( TTP ) estimate Kaplan-Meier method . The percentage subject achieve sCR , CR , VGPR PR , tabulate , sCR+CR+VGPR+PR disease rate estimate exact 80 % confidence interval . Duration response among subject achieve sCR , CR , VGPR PR , define length interval initial response progression ; duration response tabulate . All toxicity tabulate type grade . An interim analysis conduct first 17 subject accrue trial order determine whether trial close due insufficient effectiveness . Although 2-year progression-free primary endpoint , response ( sCR , CR , VGPR , PR ) use interim analysis surrogate endpoint since evaluate much sooner progression . The response rate newly diagnose patient MM varies across publish Phase II III trial 40 % 90 % . When become obvious less 8 first 17 subject induction therapy responder ( e.g. , 3 first 13 subject respond ) , study close .</detailed_description>
