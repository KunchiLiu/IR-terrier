	<brief_summary>Focal dermal hypoplasia , Goltz syndrome , result genetic change , mutation PORCN gene locate X chromosome . This neurodevelopmental disorder characterize birth defect skin , skeleton , eye , case organ . Our team work obtain good understand mutation PORCN lead clinical feature Goltz syndrome . We also try identify genetic change patient mutation PORCN find . We also investigate condition phenotype similar Goltz syndrome determine also mutations PORCN . We collect blood sample patient parent . DNA sample isolate used genetic testing . We also review medical record compare clinical symptom detect mutation determine correlation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Selected X-linked Disorders : Goltz Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goltz syndrome Focal Dermal Hypoplasia ( FDH ) X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder . The primary feature FDH include area hypoplastic skin ( atrophy , linear pigmentation herniation fat dermal defect ) , digital patterning defect ( syndactyly , polydactyly , camptodactyly , absence deformity ) , ocular dental malformation , mild dysmorphism . Variable defect include point chin , hypoplastic ear , nasal deformity , short stature , papillomas lip , gingival larynx , dystrophic nail , sparse brittle hair . Mental retardation occur approximately 15 % . 90 % individual FDH female . 95 % percent case 100 % male case appear de novo . Using array-based comparative hybridization ( array-CGH ) deletion initially identify PORCN two girl FDH . Sequencing gene region result identification mutation PORCN &gt; 75 % individual affect FDH . A manuscript describe mutation publish Nature Genetics ( Wang , 2007 ) . PORCN encode human homolog Drosophila porcupine protein find drosophila mouse study key regulator Wnt-protein signaling . We believe PORCN mutation may cause FDH affect Wnt signaling , yet prove . For study collect information patient clinical finding suggestive FDH know PORCN mutation . A detailed family history obtain indicate , additional family member evaluate afer appropriately obtain write voluntary consent . A detailed report history physical finding obtain refer physician patient identify outside facility participant may evaluate study collaborator . Blood obtain affected individual unaffected parent affect unaffected family member indicate . Occasionally , affected individual may undergo surgical procedure removal tissue ; case may obtain tissue would otherwise discard essential diagnostic study clinical care patient . It anticipate specimen extremely valuable understanding pathogenesis investigated condition . DNA , RNA protein prepare leukocyte tissue use mutation analysis molecular study identify gene . Permanent lymphoblastoid cell line prepare stored laboratory permanent source DNA molecular study .</detailed_description>
