	<brief_title>A Comparison Renal Perfusion Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( TAAA ) Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvement surgical technique postoperative care , renal dysfunction consistently remain significant potentially lethal complication thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ( TAAA ) repair . In attempt alleviate postoperative renal failure associate mortality , several technique intraoperative strategy use include : intraoperative administration diuretic , steroid , prostaglandin ; minimization ischemic time ; renal hypothermia cold crystallid solution ; selective warm ( normothermic ) blood perfusion part leave heart bypass ( LHB ) system ; hemodilution . However , despite use adjuvant technique , incidence renal failure TAAA repair still range 3 % 27 % . One technique mention involves cold crystalloid renal artery perfusion . This method aim reduce metabolic need renal system induce local hypothermia . Because oxygen consumption decrease 7 % degree Celsius temperature reduce , metabolic need tubular cell reduce almost 50 % 30 degree Celsius . After aorta clamp open , renal artery perfuse lactated Ringers solution ( LR ) cool 4 degree Celsius utilize roller pump transport LR appropriately cool ice bath . This decrease temperature kidney average 20 degree Celsius . The volume LR require achieve temperature range 600 1800 ml . Renal cool show preserve renal tissue long warm ischemic time keep minimum . We recently compare renal artery cold crystalloid perfusion normothermic blood perfusion randomize clinical trial involve 30 patient discover via multivariable analysis cold LR protective acute postoperative renal dysfunction . In study , find 62.5 % patient receive normothermic blood perfusion develop acute postoperative renal dysfunction versus 21.4 % cold LR group ( p = 0.03 ) . One method renal protection often use involves selective cold blood perfusion renal artery . This technique also aim reduce renal ischemic time aortic cross-clamping improve oxygenation renal tissue ; thereby , prevent reperfusion injury organ dysfunction often associate operation . During aneurysm repair , leave atrio-distal aortic bypass perform use centrifugal pump . Tubing connect distal end circuit pass container ice allow perfusion renal artery cold blood . The flow rate renal artery range 100 450 ml/min . The celiac axis superior mesenteric artery remain individually perfuse standard fashion use normothermic blood . The best method achieve renal protection remain unclear . Currently , normothermic blood cold LR remain two commonly use method renal artery perfusion TAAA repair . This randomized trial compare effectiveness two form renal artery perfusion , cold LR versus cold blood , identify method beneficial prevention postoperative renal dysfunction .</detailed_description>
