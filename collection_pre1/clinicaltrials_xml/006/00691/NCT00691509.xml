	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine phytoestrogen intake affect breast cancer progression survival woman breast cancer . - To consider influence phytochemical breast cancer progression patient , use sample patient blood urine patient-derived data . - To develop database food , dietary supplement , phytoestrogens base data derive patient . - To consider influence diet dietary supplement quality life patient . - To measure 17 phytoestrogens blood urine sample patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo blood urine sample collection year 5 year routine clinical follow-up breast cancer diagnosis treatment . Blood sample frozen future analysis body hormone , tumor marker , immune reaction , well vitamins plant chemical reflect patient diet supplement . Blood sample also analyze genetic study cancer risk factor polymorphisms . Urine sample analyze presence phytoestrogens metabolites immunoassay , high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) , mass spectrometry . Some sample analyze estrogenic potency estrogen receptor-mediated chemical activate luciferase gene expression test ass total plasma level estrogen-mimics previously detect test . Phytochemicals also assess . Patients also complete series questionnaire year 5 year EPIC 7-day Food Diary year 2 4 assess role diet lifestyle breast cancer survival . The questionnaire include EORTC Quality Life-30 ass lifestyle ; General Health Questionnaire 12 assess general health level anxiety ; two Food Frequency questionnaires assess habitual dietary intake phytoestrogens .
