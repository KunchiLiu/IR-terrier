	<brief_summary>In patient treated monoclonal antibody infliximab ( RemicadeÂ® ) -which bind block tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) - infusomat filter routinely use prevent early adverse event observed individual receive intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) . We recently use filter patient suffer malaise vomit context IVIG substitution therapy . In patient symptom improve IVIG-induced complement-activation reduce ( unpublished observation ) . Based simple observation hypothesize simple approve filter-system may efficient retain complement-activating immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) aggregate IVIG-preparations . This effect may reduce complement activation - consecutive inflammation - thereby diminish adverse event . In prospective study propose investigate complement activation side effect IVIG infusion relate individual receive conventional ( i.e . unfiltered ) vs. filter IVIG-preparations .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective single center study observational phase ( phase A ) randomize intervention-phase ( phase B ) , monitor adverse event complement activation IVIG infusion . Patients would enrol Out-patient Clinic Division Hematology Department Internal Medicine University Hospital Basel ( USB ) . Based number patient receive IVIG Division Hematology USB expect able complete data accrual within 8-10 month . Inclusion criterion : patient Division Hematology University Hospital Basel , Switzerland allogeneic stem cell transplant old 18 year plan least 2 application IVIG . The patient include study inform consent . Methods : Side effect IVIG monitor use standardized questionnaire distribute nursing staff patient ( please see attachment ) . Complement activation monitor IVIG-infusion use standard C3 , C4 50 % complement hemolytic activity ( CH50 ) assay . Serum level immunoglobulin A , immunoglobulin M immunoglobulin G quantify IVIG-infusion . In phase A study aim include approximately 40 patient ( would predict include approximately 20 patient clinical symptom ) . In phase B would randomize patient two group similar size , first group receive standard unfiltered IVIG infusion , second group receive 0.2um filtered IVIG infusion</detailed_description>
