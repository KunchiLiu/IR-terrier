	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) intensive care unit common , devastate costly . However , minimal evidence exists guide prescription optimal renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . An important area uncertainty surround relative effect convective versus diffusive mode clearance . Although clearance mode provide similar degree small molecule clearance , convective mode permit enhanced clearance larger-sized molecule may mediate kidney systemic toxicity set AKI . Continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRTs ) frequently apply critically ill patient AKI . Convective clearance , apply continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) diffusive clearance , apply continuous venovenous hemodialysis ( CVVHD ) , may readily compare context patient receive CRRT . The purpose study examine feasibility conducting large study determine whether convective clearance ( hemofiltration ) confers improve outcome compare diffusive clearance ( hemodialysis ) patient AKI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Optimal Mode Renal Replacement Therapy Acute Kidney Injury ( OMAKI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal mode clearance critically ill patient acute kidney injury ( AKI ) require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) unclear . Although convection ( provided hemofiltration ) diffusion ( provided hemodialysis ) provide equivalent removal small-sized molecule , hemofiltration offer potential removal large molecule many may toxic . Hemofiltration hemodialysis never compare rigorous randomize trial date . Continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) widely use management critically ill patient AKI current CRRT technology provide practical platform compare convective diffusive clearance . We hypothesize continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) - identical dos small molecule clearance provide comparison treatment continuous venovenous hemodialysis ( CVVHD ) - lead improved patient outcomes . This study unblinded pilot RCT design test feasibility conduct subsequent large scale study ass whether CVVH lead improved patient outcome ( ie , survival , renal recovery ) compare CVVHD . Although collect full array patient-relevant data 60 day follow randomization , main purpose pilot study demonstrate feasibility recruiting , treat follow patient study design test hypothesis . Patient Population The recruitment target study 75 patient . The inclusion exclusion criterion design enroll patient AKI basis presume acute tubular necrosis would ordinarily candidate continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) Canada . The overall philosophy enroll begin apply study therapy close possible clinical need start renal replacement therapy . Similarly , would like avoid enrol patient whose risk death high study therapy unlikely impact clinical outcome . Treatments We employ equivalent dos hemofiltration ( 35 mL/kg/hr replacement fluid ) hemodialysis ( 35 mL/kg/hr dialysate ) . Therapies administer use Primsaflex machine ( Gambro Inc. ) use regional citrate anticoagulation , heparin anticoagulation anticoagulation . Hospital-specific protocols anticoagulation use . We obtain Health Canada permission utilize Prismocal , Normocarb , Hemosol BO Prismasol 4 infusates patient receive CVVH .</detailed_description>
