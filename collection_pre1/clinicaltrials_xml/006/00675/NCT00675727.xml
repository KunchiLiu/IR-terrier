	<brief_title>Safety Study CADI-05 Patients With Advanced Stage Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because highly effective treatment option patient advance , unresectable melanoma , participation clinical trial novel therapy frequently best therapeutic alternative . CADI-05 promising agent two reason . First , patient advance melanoma frequently disturb symptom anorexia associate weight loss , fatigue , chemotherapy-associated side effect nausea vomit . CADI-05 low side effect profile , actually improve symptom . Second , melanomas generally immunogenic , sometimes patient mount significant immune response cause spontaneous regression tumor . High-dose interleukin-2 , relatively toxic therapy stimulate immune system , cause long-term regression stage IV melanoma small percentage patient . In addition , combine adoptive immunotherapy , response rate high 50 % observe . Therefore , induction potent antitumor immune response melanoma highly effective therapeutic modality . Because CADI-05 potent immunostimulatory effect excellent side effect profile , attractive option treatment stage IV melanoma patient . Preliminary data ongoing preclinical study murine melanoma model show CADI-05 significant biological activity metastatic melanoma ( G. Robertson , unpublished data ) . Although possible CADI-05 single agent activity advance melanoma , may also useful conjunction systemic agent adjuvant conjunction immunotherapy regimen . In addition , previous human trial suggest CADI-05 may helpful symptom control improvement quality life patient advance melanoma . In spite promising data number preclinical clinical study agent , U.S. study effect CADI-05 cancer patient perform . Therefore , present research study propose evaluate safety CADI-05 treatment advance melanoma . In addition , preliminary data regard clinical response rate immune response collect .</detailed_description>
