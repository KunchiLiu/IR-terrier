	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn Revlimid® ( lenalidomide ) , along standard-of-care steroid treatment already receive , help control Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease ( cGVHD ) . The safety study drug combination steroid also study . Primary Objectives : - To assess response rate chronic GVHD Lenalidomide fail steroid - To evaluate safety tolerability Lenalidomide patient chronic GVHD Secondary Objectives : - To assess steroid-sparing capacity Lenalidomide ( proportion patient able discontinue steroid receive follow therapy Lenalidomide ) - To assess change QOL treatment Lenalidomide - To analyze survival 6 12 month initiation Lenalidomide - To evaluate relapse underlying malignancy well second malignancy 6 12 month initiation Lenalidomide</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) Second Line Therapy Patients With Chronic Graft-Vs-Host Disease ( GVHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . It may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Researchers want find lenalidomide improve cGVHD help decrease amount steroid need , may help prevent long-term side effect occur steroid use long period time . Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , take lenalidomide mouth ( 1 larger-dose capsule 2 smaller-dose capsule ) daily 21 day follow 7 day without treatment ( `` rest period '' ) . Each 28-day period call cycle therapy . You 6 cycle therapy study . Study Drug Administration : You swallow lenalidomide capsule whole water ( 16 ounce ) time day . You break , chew , open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next day ( DO NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . Study Visits : During treatment , additional test check side effect learn body 's response therapy . You test every 2 week ( Cycles 1 2 ) , month ( Cycles 3-6 ) , every 3 month 1 year start treatment study drug . - You physical exam . - You full skin assessment . For assessment , study doctor look skin see skin show reaction cGVHD transplant . - You 2-minute walk test . For test , ask walk 2 minute , walk distance measure . - You grip strength test . For test , ask sit squeeze something meter measure strength . - You complete questionnaire feel physically , emotionally , socially . It take 20 minute complete . - You complete another questionnaire ass symptom . It take 20 minute complete . - You blood draw ( 2 tablespoon ) routine test check immune-suppressive drug ( tacrolimus cyclosporine ) level blood . - You ask feel side effect may experience since last visit . Females able child regular menstrual cycle must agree pregnancy test weekly first 28 day study participation every 28 day study , end study , 28 day follow end study . If menstrual cycle irregular , pregnancy test must occur weekly first 28 day every 14 day study , study discontinuation , day 14 28 follow discontinuation study . Your dose study drug temporarily stop decrease study doctor think necessary safety . Other drug may also give help decrease side effect . The study doctor tell drug necessary . Length Study : You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If tolerate respond study treatment , study 1 year enrollment . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . It also approve combination dexamethasone previously treat multiple myeloma . Its use study investigational authorize use research . Up 46 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
