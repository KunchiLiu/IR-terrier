	<brief_title>Falls - Tailoring Interventions Patient Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient fall define `` patient experience unplanned descent floor '' . Patient fall hospital key safety issue represent frequently report adverse event acute care setting . Previous work relate fall risk assessment suggest large majority fall ( 78 % ) occur result presence physiological risk factor confusion , incontinence , poor balance mobility problem . These fall consider preventable classified iatrogenic . Phase 1 Specific Aim : To describe current barrier , facilitator , method fall risk communication acute care setting ( 2 academic medical center 2 community hospital unit ) . 1 . What fall risk communication exists within context patient care workflow alert nurse provider ( physician , physical therapist , pharmacist ) regard patient ' fall risk status ? - What elements alert point care support fall risk communication nurse interdisciplinary team member ? - How alert communicate professional paraprofessional provider , patient , family ? 2 . What communication action prevent fall exists within context patient care workflow promotes use fall prevention plan care ? - Based empirical data reduce barrier enhance facilitator , information system use create communicate tailor evidence-based fall risk patient safety plan care derive nursing fall risk assessment ? - Based C-IC conceptual model , tailor evidence-based fall risk patient safety plan care communicate professional paraprofessional provider , patient , family ? Phase 2 Specific Aim : To develop Fall Prevention Tool Kit ( FPTK ) prototype include 1 ) The Fall Risk Alert Communication Plan translate individual patient 's fall risk assessment interdisciplinary fall risk status communication 2 ) The Patient Safety Plan Care ( PSPOC ) , translate individual patient 's fall risk assessment decision support intervention create tailor evidence-based plan care use professional paraprofessional provider , patient , family member across acute care setting . The FPTK develop fall risk assessment literature , evidence-based fall prevention guideline knowledge gain Phase 1 . FPTK component target common risk communication/fall intervention requirement identify Phase 1 across four hospital facilitate test prototype Phase 3 improve generalizability finding . Phase 3 Specific Aim : To evaluate effectiveness FPTK prototype reduce patient fall . 1 . Is FPTK used communicate fall risk status facilitate adherence tailor patient safety plan care recommendation ? 2 . Is relationship use FPTK incidence fall ( primary outcome measure ) fall-related injury ( secondary outcome measure ) ? 3 . Is difference frequency tailor fall prevention intervention document professional paraprofessional provider , patient family member access FPTK compare usual care ? Phase 4 Specific Aim : To evaluate satisfaction FPTK prototype generate recommendation improvement . 1 . Are interdisciplinary team member , paraprofessional , patient family member satisfy FPTK ? 2 . What components useful recommendation make improve perceived usefulness ease use FPTK ? If FPTK work , one see : 1 ) tool kit use helpful useful component identify , 2 ) use tool kit satisfy use , 3 ) decrease incidence fall fall injury .</detailed_description>
