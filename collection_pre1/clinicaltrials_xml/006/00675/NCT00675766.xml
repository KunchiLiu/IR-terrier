	<detailed_description>Over past several year HIV epidemic change disease primarily young , gay/bisexual , Caucasian men one increasingly affect people color , woman , , specific relevance application , old adult . Indeed , number AIDS case individual age 50 triple last several year , CDC estimate United States 15 % patient AIDS age 50.1 There reason believe incidence , clinical manifestation course HIV-associated CNS dysfunction may differ function age . Since mid 1980 's VA vanguard institution engage research clinical care HIV-infected adult . With specific regard issue age HIV , HIV-infected veteran tend significantly old patient drawn general community . For example , West Los Angeles VA 303 583 ( 52 % ) HIV-infected patient follow Infectious Disease clinic age 50 . Across entire VA system , nearly twice many HIV infect veteran age 70 30 year age . 2 Yet , vast majority research conduct date younger adult - degree data generalize old veteran population unclear . Also unclear whether advance age confers independent risk cognitive impairment HIV-infected person . Additionally , functional impact ( i.e. , impact daily function drive ability , financial management , medication adherence ) cognitive impairment group remain unknown . Exploratory study perform applicant ' laboratory provide preliminary support hypothesis advance age potentiate deleterious neurocognitive effect HIV infection . Given `` gray '' HIV epidemic , particularly among veteran population , research examine neurocognition among old HIV-infected veteran well functional `` real world '' impact deficits great relevance VA mission . The result study could provide important insight interaction age HIV disease , identify target intervention advance burgeon population older infect person . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES Objective 1 . To Determine Effect Age Neuropsychological Performance HIV+ Persons This objective seek determine degree old age represent independent risk factor neuropsychological impairment HIV infect person , particular emphasis cognitive process preferentially impact normal age process well HIV infection . Hypothesis 1.1 Controlling potential confounding factor substance use length infection , interaction effect age HIV serostatus neuropsychological performance , evident cross-sectionally longitudinally . Specifically , expect find old HIV+ individual exhibit great rate neuropsychological impairment ( use age-corrected test norm ) young HIV+ person . Neurocognitive function subserve frontal-subcortical system sensitive effect age HIV infection ( learn , motor psychomotor speed , executive function ) disproportionately affect among old HIV+ participant . While synergistic effect HIV age evident cross sectional basis , pronounce examine longitudinally course study .</detailed_description>
