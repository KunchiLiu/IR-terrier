	<brief_summary>A multilocus interaction three pro-inflammatory cytokine single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , -3448 Tumor Necrosis Factor-α , -7227 Interleukin 6 , 33314 Interleukin 6R report Menon associate 2006 . The researcher report able predict spontaneous preterm birth 65.2 % population restrict European-American mother . Expansion research need determine result also applicable Black population . Statement Purpose The purpose research determine multi-locus genetic interaction tumor necrosis factor-α ( -3448 ) , interleukin 6 ( -7227 ) , interleukin 6R ( 33314 ) , describe Menon et al . ( 2006 ) , associate preterm birth Black mother-infant dyad . Research Aims Hypotheses : Primary Aim 1.0 : To determine carriage one high risk genetic pattern , identify Menon et al . ( 2006 ) , present 65 % Black mother preterm births 35 % Black mother term birth . Hypothesis 1.0 : There statistically significant difference occurrence one eight high risk genetic pattern , identify Menon et al . ( 2006 ) , population Black mother preterm birth ( case ) Black mother term birth ( control ) . Primary Aim 2.0 : To determine carriage one high risk genetic pattern , identify Menon et al . ( 2006 ) , present 65 % Black preterm newborns 35 % Black term newborn . Hypothesis 2.0 : There statistically significant difference occurrence one eight high risk genetic pattern , identify Menon et al . ( 2006 ) , population Black preterm newborn ( case ) Black term newborn ( control ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods Study Design A gene association study , use case-control design , utilized . Each case control include genetic mother newborn infant . Setting A multicenter ( n=2 ) study propose . St. Mary 's Medical Center West Palm Beach , Florida Broward General Medical Center Ft. Lauderdale , Florida two research center . Sample : It estimate sample 166 mother-infant dyad ( 332 individual ) need test study hypothesis . The sample size adjust allow 10 % drop rate . The control group include 110 term mother 110 term infant . The case group include 56 preterm mother 56 preterm infant . It expect site able enroll 83 family dyad less two year . A reasonable effort make enroll eligible family dyad . Enrollment le 50 % eligible subject lead site review remedy problem result possible site closure . Enrollment site minimal 66 family dyad maximum 100 family dyad .</detailed_description>
