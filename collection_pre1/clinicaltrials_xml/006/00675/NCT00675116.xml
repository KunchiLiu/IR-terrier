	<criteria>Healthy determine Physician Responsible , base medical evaluation include history , physical examination , laboratory test , cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory variable outside reference range population study , exception liver transaminase , troponin I TSH , may include Investigator considers find introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Please note subject liver transaminase , troponin I TSH value within range specify exclusion criterion . Male female 18 65 year age inclusive . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea confirm screen follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml &lt; 140 pmol/L.. Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) must discontinue HRT postmenopausal status confirm per test prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , allow use HRT study .

The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect drug ( whichever longer ) The subject screen alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 1.5x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) ; test may repeat see value return within acceptance range laboratory abnormality must resolve baseline visit . Subjects troponin I value &gt; 0.03 ng/mL screen eligible . Testing may repeat . The subject refer treat physician evaluation , appropriate . Subjects TSH value upper limit normal range ( ULN ) screen eligible . The subject refer treat physician evaluation , appropriate . Testing may repeat see whether value return within normal range abnormality must resolve baseline visit . Subjects history myopathy rhabdomyolysis The subject unable abstain strenuous physical activity 72 hour prior screen , 72 hour prior first dose last PK sample collect , 72 hour prior followup visit . The subject donate unit blood ( 450 mL ) within previous 60 day intend donate month complete study Subjects history eye disease ( exclude moderate myopia ) clinically relevant eye examination finding , opinion study ophthalmologist contraindicates participation study The subject currently take regular ( course ) medication whether prescribed , include vitamin herbal remedy , St John 's Wort . Any concurrent medication permit 48 hour admission CPRU end study period ( followup visit ) , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety .
