	<brief_title>Childhood Asthma Research Education ( CARE ) Network Trial - Maintenance Versus Intermittent Inhaled Steroids Wheezing Toddlers ( MIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Childhood asthma cause many factor , include allergen , cigarette smoke , air pollution , infection . Symptoms include wheeze , shortness breath , chest tightness , cough . Wheezing illness common first several year life , continuous wheezing , recurrent intermittent wheezing , may indicator asthma . Recurrent intermittent wheeze also lead breathe difficulty , sleep disturbance , severe exacerbation result emergency department visit , hospitalization , even death . The Prevention Early Asthma Kids ( PEAK ) Acute Intervention Management Strategies ( AIMS ) study , part Childhood Asthma Research Education ( CARE ) Network , well several study , identify therapy may improve recurrent wheeze young child . This study compare safety effectiveness two treatment regimens—low dose ICS take daily basis versus high dos ICS take respiratory tract illnesses—at improve recurrent wheeze toddler . Study researcher also identify individual characteristic ( e.g. , age , gender , family history asthma allergy , degree allergy , genetics ) may associate treatment response . Lastly , relationship virus infection respiratory illness , wheeze episode , response study treatment also study . This study enroll child 12 53 month age experience episode wheeze cough year study entry , least one episode require one following : oral steroid , urgent unscheduled medical visit , emergency room visit , hospitalization . This study begin 2-week evaluation period potential participant receive placebo day . Parents document child 's asthma symptom medication use daily diary . Next , baseline study visit , eligible participant randomly assign one follow two 12-month treatment group : - Group 1 participant receive low dose ICS day night , except respiratory tract illness . During respiratory tract illness , participant receive placebo morning low dose ICS night 7 day . - Group 2 participant receive high dose ICS twice day 7 day respiratory illness placebo day night time . Throughout 12 month treatment , participant receive albuterol treat respiratory symptom prednisolone asthma symptom worsen . Parents give action plan help manage child 's symptom , respiratory illness , parent contact study researcher determine best treatment plan . Study visit occur baseline Weeks 4 , 12 , 20 , 28 , 36 , 44 , 52 . Participants ' parent take part schedule telephone interview one month clinic visit provide information child 's asthma symptom , study medication use , health problem . Most study visit include physical exam lung function test . At select study visit , follow occur : allergy skin testing , blood collection , nasal mucus sampling , parent questionnaire assess asthma , quality life , environmental factor . A portion participant ' blood undergo genetic analysis ; blood collection parent genetic analysis optional . Throughout treatment period , participant ' parent record asthma symptom medication usage daily diary .</detailed_description>
