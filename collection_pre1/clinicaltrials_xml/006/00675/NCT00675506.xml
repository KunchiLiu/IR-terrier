	<brief_summary>Obesity , condition occur person much body fat , affect 31 % people United States . It associate increase risk diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , cardiovascular disease . Abdominal obesity , particular , also associate low level growth hormone , hormone affect rate growth way body use energy . Growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) substance make body naturally increase growth hormone level . Administering GHRH people obese may help return growth hormone level normal , turn , may lead reduce abdominal fat improve cardiovascular function . This study evaluate effectiveness synthetic GHRH decreasing amount abdominal fat improve cardiovascular function people obese .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone Reducing Abdominal Fat People Who Are Obese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity , define high amount excess body fat , one wide-spread health problem today . A variety factor lead obesity . These factor include physical inactivity , family history genetics , metabolism , hormone imbalance . The excess body fat obesity increase person 's risk number life-threatening disease , include heart disease , gall stone , type 2 diabetes , certain type cancer . People abdominal obesity , fat store predominantly around person 's midsection , particularly prone weight-related disease . Studies show administration growth hormone obese people reduce abdominal fat , associate adverse side effect . GHRH natural hypothalamic peptide stimulate growth hormone release . GHRH may able normalize growth hormone level , reduce abdominal fat , lessen risk cardiovascular disease people obese , without associate side effect growth hormone administration . However , study need GHRH . This study evaluate safety effectiveness synthetic GHRH decreasing amount abdominal fat improve cardiovascular function people obese . Participation study last 1 year screen include 9 study visit . During Visit 1 , participant undergo screen test include medical history , physical exam , body measurement , blood draw , urine test , GHRH+Arginine stimulation test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , test presence blood stool . Eligible participant return within next 3 week inpatient clinic stay Visit 2 . Participants ask keep food record food consume 4 day second visit . Visit 2 include physical exam , medical smoking history , review current medication , body measurement , overnight blood draw , body metabolism evaluation , oral glucose tolerance test , two questionnaire . Also Visit 2 , participant assign randomly treatment active GHRH placebo . Participants teach give injection study drug , take daily 12 month . Participants also receive 1-month supply study drug supply refill subsequent study visit . Upon start treatment , participant undergo test , include whole body DEXA scan , abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) scan , carotid ultrasound , ECG . Visit 3 occur Week 2 treatment include review study medication , question side effect experience , vital sign measurement , blood draw , ECG , , female , urine test . Visits 4 , 5 , 7 identical Visit 3 occur Months 1 , 3 , 9 respectively . Visit 6 occur Month 6 identical Visit 2 without overnight blood draw . Visit 8 occur Month 12 identical Visit 2 , except study drug dispense . At Month 13 , participant complete final study visit , include repeat test Visit 1 .</detailed_description>
