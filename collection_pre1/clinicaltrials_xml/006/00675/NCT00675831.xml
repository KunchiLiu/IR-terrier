	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate safety efficacy cell depletion donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) product use CliniMACS machine . Previously , patient hematologic malignancy relapse transplant give infusion donor white blood cell calsed donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) way boost immune function fight cancer . Information research study suggest lower number certain type white blood cell call CD25+ Tregs DLI may allow great effect . In research study , look appropriate dose DLI deplete CD25+ Treg white blood cell give safely .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infusion Donor Lymphocytes Depleted CD25+ Regulatory T-cells Patients With Relapsed Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The original marrow/stem cell donor undergo one two white blood cell collection procedure call leukopheresis . The cell collect first leukopheresis send laboratory amount white blood cell collect measure . If number cell collect first leukopheresis enough , donor second leukopheresis procedure . - Once enough lymphocyte collect donor , CliniMACS CD25 Reagent System device reduce number CD25+ Tregs . The CD25+ deplete donor lymphocyte infuse participant intravenously . Participants observe one hour infusion . - One , two , four eight week DLI , participant return clinic follow-up visit . At visit physical exam , question participant general health , blood test perform .</detailed_description>
