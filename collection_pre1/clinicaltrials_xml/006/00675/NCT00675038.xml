	<brief_summary>Many hematological disorder treat give red blood cell . Over long period time iron red blood cell accumulate tissue heart , liver , endocrine gland . This condition refer iron overload may become life threaten due effect iron tissue . The normal method evaluation iron overload liver biopsy . This procedure invasive potential risk , bleed infection . It desirable establish method assess iron overload invasive . New magnet resonance imaging ( MRI ) relaxation technique ( T2*MRI ) use indirectly assess liver iron content iron heart . Results T2*MRIs show excellent correlation liver iron content heart function . The use method assessment minimize risk inconvenience liver biopsy possibly allow frequent evaluation iron overload , thus well treatment patient . Participants study undergo liver biopsy liver iron content T2* MRI liver heart . Results procedure perform study compare , end result possible elimination invasive procedure diagnose iron overload .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Non-Invasive Assessment Hepatic And Myocardial Iron Through T2* Magnet Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) In Patients With Iron Overload</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Quantitative measurement hepatic cardiac iron single-breath-hold MRI T2* allow u determine value technique non-invasive method monitoring liver cardiac iron content . By obtain T2 measurement , able compare two different technique non-invasive iron assessment . With regard liver , correlate T2* measurement gold standard , LIC liver biopsy . Because feasible perform cardiac biopsy evaluate degree cardiac hemosiderosis , evaluate relationship cardiac T2* value leave right diastolic function , leave ventricular ejection fraction , leave ventricular end-systolic volume leave ventricular mass index obtain echocardiography MUGA scan perform part routine clinical care patient . In order estimate whether cardiac T2* value clinically relevant , also investigate relationship T2* value need cardiac medication due cardiac hemosiderosis . Cardiac hepatic T2* measurement also compare visual appearance T2* MR image order investigate relationship two assessment . Cardiac hepatic T2* respective visual appearance T2* MR image compare serum ferritin evaluate potential relationship among measurement iron overload . Amen T2* T2 phantom device allow calibration MR measurement absolute iron content . Phantoms test tube fill aqueous solution gel compound material mimic various tissue relaxation time ( T1 , T2 T2* ) . Phantoms commonly use MRI quantification desire . Our phantom consist multitude small vial visible image plane . The relaxation time vary different vial phantom know accurately , especially T2 T2* value , vary physiological relevant range . This way phantom use calibrate T2* value obtain patient heart liver eventually correlate absolute iron concentration . If accurate , T2* MRI technique would ultimately allow non-invasive method quantitatively assess myocardial liver iron accumulation , could predict degree morbidity due iron overload . This new technique could greatly improve care iron overload patient offer practical risk free method evaluation body iron load . We plan apply preliminary information future study area . Eventually plan use T2* MRI measurement longitudinal study patient iron overload , assess degree iron burden monitor chelation therapy treatment . Amen Dark blood application state-of-the-art cardiac MRI commonly apply . There risk associate dark blood preparation . Comparison dark bright blood measurement show whether sequence yield similar result whether one technique less susceptible cardiac motion associate artifact , thereby offer high accuracy small error calculation T2* iron concentration . Information heart function obtain use MRI technique , however information need validate different population , patient iron overload . If MR data show high correlation echocardiography MUGA functional data , subsequent protocol could conduct functional information gain MR measurement , thereby avoid acquire MUGA scan eliminating exposure radiation well streamline protocol add additional measurement already schedule MR iron scan . Performing cardiac measurement patient use MRI technique allow u expand use technique future large study . Pulmonary hypertension cause progressive right ventricular dysfunction severe respiratory symptom ( e.g. , dyspnea , hypoxemia , poor exercise tolerance , etc. ) . The association myocardium iron deposition relationship pulmonary hypertension investigate . Pulmonary hypertension prevalent complication among patient hematologic disease , especially hemolytic component anemia . Because many patient treat blood transfusion consequently develop iron accumulation heart , investigation association myocardial hemosiderosis pulmonary hypertension warrant . Finally , little understood iron load unload cellular molecular level , propose perform tissue microarray analysis liver biopsy sample obtain child iron overload . This powerful tool help identify over- under-expressed gene clinical scenario iron loading , later set iron mobilization overload patient . This pilot study allow u investigate difference gene expression patient mild , moderate severe iron overload , determine quantitative LIC liver biopsy . Our approach allow characterization gene expression analysis pattern reflect cellular response different degree iron overload . This study obtain `` normal liver '' control population , since sickle cell patient without transfusional iron overload clinical indication liver biopsy . It hop , however , subsequent therapeutic protocol also include microarray study liver biopsy sample . In way , current microarray analysis serve `` baseline '' patient serve control difference gene expression . This particularly important patient undergo successful chelation therapy low LIC . Overall , understand genetic biochemical event regulate iron load unloading process could greatly improve ability treat patient appropriately .</detailed_description>
