	<brief_summary>Subjects undergo elective ERCP EUS receive standard monitoring sedation . In addition , capnography measure carbon dioxide level graphically assess respiratory activity use . Subjects randomize either capnography blind titration arm . In capnography titration arm , endoscopy team would make aware capnographic abnormality arise throughout procedure . In capnography blind arm , information available endoscopy team represent standard care . It hypothesis use capnography prevent low oxygen level know hypoxemia , procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo elective ERCP EUS receive standard monitoring sedation . In addition , capnography measure carbon dioxide level graphically assess respiratory activity use . Subjects randomize either capnography blind titration arm . In capnography titration arm , endoscopy team would make aware capnographic abnormality arise throughout procedure . In capnography blind arm , information available endoscopy team represent standard care . It hypothesis use capnography prevent low oxygen level know hypoxemia , procedure . The primary outcome study proportion patient hypoxemia two arm . Review literature indicate incidence hypoxemia without supplemental oxygen varies 30-70 % . Our sample size calculation base reduction hypoxemia incidence 40 % 20 % . Secondary outcome proportion patient oxygen requirement , major hypoxemia apnea ( lack respiratory activity via capnography least 15 second ) two arm . We perform univariable multivariable analysis determine risk factor apnea .</detailed_description>
