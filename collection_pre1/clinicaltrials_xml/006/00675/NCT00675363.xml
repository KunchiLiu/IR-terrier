	<brief_title>Daily Sedative Interruption Critically Ill Patients Being Managed With Sedation Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All critically ill , mechanically ventilated patient Intensive Care Unit receive medication relieve pain anxiety . However , accumulation medication associate serious complication , notably long time breathe machine ICU . Two strategy show dramatically improve patient outcome : nurse-directed protocol give sedation , daily interruption sedation . However , strategy widely adopt , physician ' concern , unclear strategy well . Given patient outcome improve either strategy , fundamental question arise whether patient manage combination two strategy reduce drug accumulation ( protocolized sedation daily interruption ) even well outcome patient manage one ( protocolized sedation ) .We conduct multicenter randomize trial 400 critically ill , mechanically ventilated patient sedation manage protocolized sedation alone , strategy . Primary outcome duration mechanical ventilation ICU hospital length stay . Secondary outcome incidence delirium , use neurologic test , nurse respiratory therapist effort associate sedation management , incidence patient self-removal line tube , patient recall ICU stay . The result large multi-center trial help inform best practice regard sedation management critically ill patient Canada elsewhere .</detailed_description>
