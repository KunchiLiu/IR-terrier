	<brief_summary>Lacerations ( deep cut ) frequent cause visit emergency department laceration repair one common procedure perform set . Children often anxious visit emergency department , visit anticipate need painful procedure particularly stressful . Though manage pain associate many minor procedure , frequently unable adequately support child treat problem n't manage anxiety well . Methods calm require medication ( e.g . distraction , parental support ) help , many patient still require sedative medication . The goal sedation pediatric emergency department relieve child 's anxiety minimizing risk adverse event . Unfortunately , sedative medication use dos slow breathing , often fail manage child 's anxiety adequately . In addition , many sedative agent require placement intravenous line , painful procedure create , rather relieve , anxiety . Currently , ideal sedative agent safe , effective , easy administer . Oral midazolam one commonly use sedative medication laceration repair child . In dose 0.5mg/kg show safe . Unfortunately , provide adequate sedation two third patient delay onset 20 minute . The remain child must either endure procedure agitate state suffer placement intravenous line administer additional sedative medication . We aim find method provide sedation laceration repair high success rate oral midazolam currently prescribe without increase risk complication . We would like evaluate new method administer midazolam use alternate route dosage . Previous study look use midazolam absorb directly mucous membrane inside nose ( intranasal ) inside mouth ( buccal ) . The use intranasal midazolam success especially give rapid onset action ( 5 minute ) , limited irritant effect drug . When place mouth , many child swallow drug spit rather allow absorb mucous membrane . There improved success drug place tongue , typically difficult young child . However , new device call `` atomizer '' develop allow improve intranasal buccal administration . The `` atomizer '' small adapter place end syringe , spread medication fine mist wide area . It spray mouth inside cheek ( buccal ) , avoid need keep medication tongue . While pediatric institution already start give midazolam atomizer , report anecdotal success method , safety effectiveness rigorously study . We propose compare three approach sedation : commonly use dos oral midazolam , atomize intranasal midazolam atomize intraoral midazolam . Children age 7 require sedation wound repair eligible enrollment . After informed consent , child randomize one three method describe . Their level sedation determine use two score validate use child ( sedation score modify CHEOPS score ) . Physician , nurse parent impression sedation also compare . By compare current approach new method , able determine method best . If identify method administer sedative drug midazolam safe , well tolerate , effective , make valuable important contribution care injured child emergency department .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study improve sedation child undergoing laceration repair emergency department . Currently , child require sedation laceration repair often receive short act benzodiazepine ( i.e. , midazolam ) orally ( mouth ) . Studies effectiveness oral midazolam minor procedure cite 50-75 % success rate . Oral midazolam variable effectiveness onset action , due first pas hepatic metabolism , oral midazolam bioavailability 27 % child ( Blumer 1998 ) . Given low success rate oral midazolam , administration via mucous membrane also attempt . When administer intranasally buccally , midazolam much high bioavailability ( Walberg 1991 ) rapid onset action . Unfortunately , give route previous study , drip nose place tongue . This lead either swallow liquid drug , expel , lead suboptimal bioavailability . Moreover , intranasal midazolam irritate nasal mucosa therefore always well tolerate . When give cooperative adult , midazolam drip onto mucosal surface bioavailability approximately 75 % ( Schwagmeier 1998 ) . It hypothesize good distribution midazolam mucosal surface would improve reliability effectiveness route administration . A device call atomizer develop purpose ( Wolfe Tory Medical , Inc. , Salt Lake City , UT ) . The atomizer attachment end small syringe cause medication propel large surface area spray ( see Figure ) . This allow great percentage medication absorb via mucosal surface direct route blood stream lead faster reliable onset action , avoid problem hepatic metabolism occur enterally absorb midazolam . We propose study determine change mode administration dose midazolam provide improve sedation child undergo anxiety-producing procedure , without adversely effect safety , length stay , patient/family staff satisfaction . To study , propose randomized clinical trial compare three method administer midazolam sedation : oral midazolam 0.5 mg per kg , buccal midazolam 0.3 mg per kg intranasal midazolam 0.3 mg per kg . The subject population child age 7 require sedation laceration repair Emergency Department Children 's Hospital Regional Medical Center . Patients exclude : closed head injury loss consciousness , abnormal neurologic exam relative baseline status , severe developmental delay baseline neurologic deficit , severe trauma suspect internal injury , acute chronic respiratory condition , renal , cardiac hepatic abnormality . Variables interest include level sedation prior procedure ( use activity scale modify CHEOPS scale ) ( McGrath 1985 ) , time adequate sedation , procedure length , length ED stay , parental , MD , RN satisfaction use Likert scale , complication respiratory depression vomit well measure need ameliorate complication . For adequate power , anticipate enrol 180 patient ( 60 treatment group ) 24-month duration study .</detailed_description>
