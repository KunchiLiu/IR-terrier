	<brief_summary>Despite progress understand pathophysiology obesity , current strategy medical management remain largely ineffective . Most effort focus reduce caloric intake increase energy expenditure , either behavior modification ( e.g . dieting , regular exercise ) alone , augment pharmacologic effort decrease appetite , inhibit fat absorption , alter metabolism . Bariatric surgery remain proven long term treatment morbid obesity . Super morbidly obese ( SMO : Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 50 ) super super morbidly obese ( SSMO : BMI &gt; 60 ) patient lose considerable weight , stabilize Body Mass Indexes ( BMIs ) still obese even morbidly obese risk considerable morbidity and/or mortality . Among commonly perform bariatric surgery , laparoscopic two-stage procedure , initial restrictive procedure follow weight loss ~100 lb complex procedure create malabsorption , gain interest . Initial study demonstrate good long-term weight loss minimal morbidity , operative mortality high risk patient . Availability biospecimens obtain stage protocol allow participate scientist unique opportunity test human tissue hypothesis develop animal . Studies propose application focus fatty acid overall fat disposition fat depot ( adipose tissue ) body , role adipose tissue hormone inflammatory process obesity associate health relate issue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite rapidly grow interest pathogenesis obesity epidemic , pathophysiology obesity remain poorly understood . While study animal yield many insight , become clear human obesity differs important way rodent . Bariatric surgery offer well outcomes , high grade obesity ( BMI &gt; 50 ) remain high risk undertake &gt; 5 % operative mortality report commonly perform bariatric surgical approach employ . By contrast , laparoscopic two-stage approach result excellent weight loss , minimal morbidity , &lt; 1 % mortality . Availability blood sample biopsy omental subcutaneous fat pair bariatric procedure protocol provide unique opportunity study key issue human obesity . This study test broad hypothesis significant yet unrecognized difference pathobiology obesity man rodent , identification may lead new therapeutic target . Accordingly , facilitate comparison aspect obesity already investigate animal model , 1. seek fat depot specific difference Long Chain Fatty Acid ( LCFA ) disposition , macrophage infiltration adipokine production obesity surgery-induced weight loss man , correlate presence/severity metabolic syndrome ( MetSyn ) Í¾ 2. , quantify relative significance response weight loss different mechanism contribute hepatic steatosis elevate triglyceride ( TG ) reduce High-Density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) typical obesity MetSyn .</detailed_description>
