	<brief_summary>The prognosis lung cancer depend much stage disease time diagnosis . Only 16 % lung cancer offer curative intend surgery . Chest x-ray gate-keeper lung cancer diagnosis , miss rate 20-60 % . A false negative chest x-ray often cause prolonged delay diagnosis - often month . Recently `` 48 hour diagnosis guaranty '' implement , help accelerate system delay ( delay referral diagnosis ) . But chest x-ray still gate-keeper ; chest x-ray negative examination cease . PET/CT high sensitivity ( 96 % ) , chest x-ray . In latter year little improvement survival rate lung cancer make . Screening study currently perform , 's time innovative thinking . PET/CT establish place stag lung cancer . But study like may help place PET/CT chain examination make cost-beneficial . The overall aim study improve patient course earlier diagnosis lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Each year 3500 new patient Denmark diagnose lung cancer . This make lung cancer second common cancer Denmark . In Europe lung cancer common cancer estimate 377 000 new case year . Lung cancer poor prognosis 5 year relative survival rate approximately 10 % Europe 15 % USA . The survival rate Denmark inferior Nordic country , partly unfavorable stage distribution time diagnosis . Lately improvement one year relative survival rate , patient offer life prolong chemotherapy , influence 5-year survival rate . The main investigation suspect lung cancer chest x-ray , chest x-rays miss rate 20-60 % , tend delay diagnosis several month . Nodules &lt; 1-1.6mm centrally place tumor increase likelihood miss diagnosis . Studies screen lung cancer promising , yet show effect term reduce mortality . FDG-PET/CT rapidly gain acceptance clinical oncology diagnose tumor , stag disease , evaluate treatment response . PET/CT new scanner modality combinng diagnostic accuracy compute tomography ( CT ) metabolic activity record positron emission tomography ( PET ) . A metaanalysis PET alone show sensitivity specificity 96 % 78 % , respectively respect diagnosis pulmonary nodule . Studies combine PET/CT technique expect increase specificity without affect high sensitivity . False positive PET/CT scan often due increase uptake 18F-flourdeoxyglucose ( FDG ) inflammatory cell ( granuloma , tuberculosis , chronic infection ) . False-negative PET/CT scan often due small size ( &lt; 5-7 mm ) high-differentiated malignancy ( bronchio-alveolar carcinoma , carcinoid ) . To knowledge similar study publish currently investigation . Methods The study divide 2 retrospective investigation ( Pre-PROLOG 1 2 ) prospective study PROLOG . Pre-PROLOG 1 We wish identify high pretest likelihood lung cancer base information referral chest x-ray . All patient refer chest x-ray examination General Practice January 1 March31 , 2005 , Department Radiology , Odense University Hospital ( OUH ) , total 1201 patient . Referral diagnosis information register retrospective survey . Patients two year later compare patient Danish Lung Cancer Register ( DLCR ) . DLCR national register , whereto 55 department Denmark report new case lung cancer . There certain overlap report , estimate 90 % lung cancer Denmark assume registered DLCR . The data collect currently analyze . Preliminary result show : 37 1201 patient register Danish Lung Cancer Register October 17 , 2007 . Nine patient diagnose prior chest x-ray one patient diagnose mesothelioma . Out 1192 refer chest x-ray different diagnosis ( without 9 known lung cancer ) 27 ( 2.2 % ) turn within next 2 year lung cancer . Pre-PROLOG 2 We wish explore delay diagnosis treatment lung cancer . All lung cancer patient diagnose Odense University Hospital ( Departments ) 1 January 2006 30 June 2007 identify . A questionnaire sent patient still alive , patient among thing ask time first symptom , 1st visit GP due symptom retrospectively related lung cancer . Another questionnaire send patient ' GP finally , case record examine . The delay divide patient delay ( first symptom 1st visit GP ) , doctor delay ( 1. visit GP referral chest x-ray/hospital department ) system delay ( referral start treatment ) . Questionnaires expect sent December 2007 . PROLOG All patient comply inclusion criterion ( age &gt; 50 year suspicion lung cancer , base clinical symptom /or history include current former smoker risk factor lay Pre-PROLOG 1 study ) refer ordinary chest x-ray Department Radiology OUH . The day next day PET/CT scan perform Department Nuclear Medicine , OUH . All patient chest x-ray PET/CT-scan . Following outcome possible follow blind reading chest x-ray PET/CT scan : 1 . Patients suspicious chest x-ray : All chest CT scan refer examination Department Medicine - Section Lung Disease , OUH . 2 . Patients unsuspicious chest x-ray : All go back GP follow-up . 3 . Patients positive PET/CT scan ( intrathoracal ) : All refer examination Department Medicine - Section Lung Disease . 4 . Patients negative PET/CT scan : All send back GP follow-up . 5 . Patients negative intrathoracal PET/CT , positive extrathoracal PET/CT : Report suggestion action send GP . Who refer patient examination . In case Gold Standard malignant pathology diagnosis . The status patient determine entrance time 6 month , 12 month , 24 month . Patients positive pathology diagnosis 24 month regard lung cancer . The start main study expect start spring 2008 . Ethics The study follow Helsinki Declaration II nr . 503 24 June 1992 nr . 499 12 June 1996 . Possible positive effect participate study : - Early diagnosis lung cancer , good chance curative treatment/better prognosis - Early diagnosis malignancy Possible negative effect participate study : - A PET/CT give effective radiation dose 14 mSv , comparable approximately 4-5 time background radiation Denmark ( 3 mSV ) . - Focus illness possible follow psykosociale effect The positive advantage participate study think outweigh negative consequence . It 's patient access possible effect study thorough information fore . All participation voluntarily . If patient want participate , normal examination carry . All information keep agreement departmental order nr . 528 15 June 2000 chapter 1 , 2 og 3 §§ 41-42 .</detailed_description>
