	<brief_title>Evaluating Effects Surgical Non-Surgical Treatment Options People With Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emphysema progressive lung disease result shortness breath reduce capacity physical activity . It cause inflammation within small air sacs small airway lung , lead destruction air sac wall eventually airway collapse . Treatment option emphysema include non-surgical surgical intervention . Pulmonary rehabilitation , non-surgical treatment , include combination education , exercise training , nutrition advice , smoke cessation program . The goal pulmonary rehabilitation increase exercise tolerance reduce breathe difficulty . Two surgical treatment option include lung volume reduction surgery , small amount damage lung tissue remove , lung transplantation , person 's damage lung replace healthy lung donor . While surgical option may offer potential improvement quality life , also impose substantial risk , include infection , pneumonia , even death . In study , researcher follow participant long period time assess effect pulmonary rehabilitation , lung volume reduction surgery , lung transplantation health outcome quality life . This study enroll people moderate severe emphysema undergone pulmonary rehabilitation , lung volume reduction surgery , lung transplantation . Participants attend annual study visit complete computerized interview health-related questionnaire assess quality life factor . Study researcher also review participant ' medical record collect information lung function blood test result .</detailed_description>
