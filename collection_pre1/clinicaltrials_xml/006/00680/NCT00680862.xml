	<brief_title>Qualitative Assessment Implementing Routine Rapid HIV Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : During past three decade , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) cause extensive illness death United States . Since advent HIV epidemic , VA healthcare system significantly impact . Veterans much high HIV risk general population . In addition , significant proportion VA patient member minority group , homeless , patient category also link high HIV prevalence . Because VA large provider HIV treatment US , imperative researcher develop innovative method 1 ) identify HIV-positive individual , 2 ) provide knowledge HIV-positive status ; 3 ) early enough disease patient place care , antiretroviral therapy effective , HIV epidemic slow reverse . Current HIV test method highly ineffective regard , due large measure method . Conventional HIV test require blood draw laboratory analysis , require patient schedule future visit receive result . Consequently , significant number people simply return test result . Current HIV prevalence figure bear . The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) estimate 1.2 million HIV infected person US , many 1/3 unaware infection . Indeed , CDC recommend routine HIV testing Americans . This recommendation predicate evidence move risk-based , routine test model one effective way significantly increase test rate . As good HIV identification system begin spread VHA , VHA must determine proper place broad routine HIV rapid test program delivery system . Demonstrating effectiveness first step . To make policy recommendation , must better understand challenge implement test system would apply , at-risk patient . The move toward routine HIV testing , combine novel diagnostic tool ( rapid test ) although highly effective , provide many implementation challenge . For example , unintended adverse consequence implement NRT ? What barriers facilitator implementation ? How important local nursing physician champion opinion leader ? These issue paramount importance reach evidence-based consensus 'best practice ' approach could look like within large , decentralize healthcare organization like VA . Objectives : The specific aim project , : 1 . To develop generalized qualitative method instrument use evaluate VA HIV rapid test implementation effort ; 2 . To employ developed instrument qualitatively document implementation previously successful NRT strategy spread NRT VA primary/urgent care practice downtown Los Angeles Outpatient Clinic ( OPC ) ; 3 . To explore document barrier , facilitator , unintended consequence implement NRT model HIV test LAOPC . Methods : We use qualitative method conduct formative process evaluation allow u fully assess research objective , : A thorough examination , exploration description barrier facilitator implement NRT Los Angeles Outpatient Clinic ( OPC ) . Status : project objective complete ; manuscript develop</detailed_description>
