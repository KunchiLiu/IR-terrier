	<brief_title>The Effect Low Intensity Exercise Quality Life Hemodynamics Patients With Permanent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Twelve patient enrol . Each subject first serve control serve treatment group . Subjects require sign inform consent prior study procedure . 2 . The exercise program structure follow : At time enrollment , patient undergo exercise treadmill test measure cardiac hemodynamics , include VO2max ( measure non-invasively use gas exchange ) maximal heart rate . Average heart rate 24 hour also measure 24-hour Holter monitor exercise program . The maximal exercise test perform treadmill use incremental protocol base estimate fitness level establish warm . For first 8-weeks participation , patient act control exercise . When 8 week period complete , return another exercise treadmill test 24-hour Holter monitor . For second 8-weeks participation , patient participate exercise training . The initial 2 week exercise supervise St. Paul University Hospital exercise facility twenty minute day , four time week . Exercise do walking use aerobic exercise equipment , include treadmill , elliptical machine , cycle ergometer row machine accord patient preference availability exercise facility home . During period patient commence train intermediate effort base perceive exertion ( Borg Scale 11-13 ) . The intensity gradually increase level corresponding 70-75 % VO2max 15 Borg Scale , whichever represent least effort . For remain six week , patient continue exercise program perceive intensity learn first two week train . During six week , patient ask exercise 30 minute , five time per week . Participants exercise home wish , require undergo supervise exercise least per week six week period require keep exercise log monitoring unsupervised effort . At end 8-week program exercise training , patient return third exercise treadmill test 24-hour Holter monitor . 3 . The Quality Life survey assess two form , Short Form 36 ( SF 36 ) Arrhythmia Related Symptom Severity Check List ( SSCL ) . Patients ask fill SF 36 QOL SSCL QOL survey submit Physical Activity Recall ( PAR ) interview time exercise treadmill test 24-hour Holter .</detailed_description>
