	<brief_summary>The purpose research study study safety effectiveness vaccinate individual previously receive avian influenza vaccine derive one type H5N1 virus vaccine derive different type avian influenza virus . A second reason study compare responses people receive two different similar type H5N1 vaccine response subject receive 2 dos H5N1 vaccine use study . The information obtain may provide important information usefulness pre-pandemic vaccination . Participants include 600 healthy adult volunteer , age 19 older , United States . Study procedures include : physical exam , vaccination either low dose ( 15 microgram ) high dose ( 90 microgram ) vaccine , blood sample , maintain memory aid record oral temperature side effect . Study participation approximately 7 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity single dose monovalent subvirion influenza vaccine produce clade 2 A/H5N1 vaccine administer intramuscular injection healthy adult elderly previously receive least 2 dos clade 1 A/H5N1 vaccine . In addition , study compare result individual receive 2 dos clade 2 A/H5N1 vaccine first time . The primary objective study compare immune response follow single low-dose ( 15 mcg ) single high-dose ( 90 mcg ) influenza vaccine derive clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 individual previously receive least 2 dos influenza vaccine derive clade 1 virus A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 ( A/VN/1203/04 ) . The secondary objective : compare immune response follow single low-dose ( 15 mcg ) single high-dose ( 90 mcg ) influenza vaccine derive clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 individual previously receive least 2 dos influenza vaccine derive clade 1 virus A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 ( A/VN/1203/04 ) group receive previous A/H5N1 vaccine receive 2 dos influenza vaccine derive clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 ; evaluate factor associate immunologic response single dose vaccine derive clade 2 virus among individual previously receive least 2 dos vaccine derive clade 1 virus ; evaluate safety single dose subvirion inactivate vaccine derive clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 individual previously receive least 2 dos influenza vaccine derive clade 1 virus A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 ( A/VN/1203/04 ) ; explore immunologic response follow vaccination clade 2 vaccine A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 influenza strain A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 , include A/VN/1203/04 ; evaluate immune response previously unvaccinated individual 1 2 dos clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 vaccine ; evaluate duration antibody responses follow 1 2 dos vaccine derive clade 2 virus A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 . This study recruit 600 healthy volunteer age 19 year old , United States , previously participate link DMID-sponsored study . This study link DMID protocol 04-063 , 05-0090 , 04-076 , 05-0015 , 05-0127 , 05-0141 , 06-0089 , 04-062 , 06-0052 , 08-0030 . The study conduct 7 vaccine center . Subjects previously receive least 2 dos clade 1 vaccine derive A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus randomize receive single dose either 15 mcg 90 mcg clade 2 vaccine derive A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 virus 1:1 ratio . H5 naïve subject previously receive least 2 dos placebo randomize receive 2 dos either 15 mcg 90 mcg clade 2 vaccine derive A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/05 virus 1:1 ratio . Volunteers observe clinic 15 minute inoculation , maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 8 day follow vaccination . Volunteers contact telephone 1 3 day vaccination assess occurrence AEs , return clinic 8-10 day vaccination AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) , review memory aid .
