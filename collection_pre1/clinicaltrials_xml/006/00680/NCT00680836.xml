	<brief_title>Gulf War Digestive Health Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 700,000 United States military personnel deploy first Persian Gulf ( PG ) War . Several month return , 25 % Veterans persistent symptom suspect related military service Gulf . Among frequent gastrointestinal symptom loose stool , excessive gas abdominal pain . These symptom typical diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . The cause IBS know ; speculate mechanism include altered GI motility , bacterial overgrowth , visceral hypersensitivity psychological stress . Another propose mechanism relate fact one third patient IBS describe onset symptom follow acute gastroenteritis . This call post-infective IBS ( PI-IBS ) . How acute gastroenteritis lead persistent GI symptom IBS know . A limited amount data suggest patient IBS may imbalance gastrointestinal microflora . Several study indicate small bowel bacterial overgrowth common individual IBS . Symptoms SBBO similar diarrhea-predominant IBS include chronic diarrhea , bloat abdominal pain . More 50 percent military personnel develop acute gastroenteritis duty Gulf . Most report symptom IBS acute onset occurred association episode acute gastroenteritis tour duty . Other traveler know colonized new micro-organism travel foreign country . This acquisition think related change diet . The natural history change bowel flora , part , depend host factor persist month travel abroad . It seem likely , PG veteran persistent diarrhea negative work-up know GI diseases PI-IBS . No study past evaluate role SBBO cause chronic GI symptom PG Veterans . Furthermore , soldier involve combat expose highly stressful environment , perhaps make susceptible persistent symptom . We hypothesize PG veteran chronic GI symptom symptom diarrhea predominant IBS cause SBBO due change microflora deployment Persian Gulf predispose stress combat . Intestinal microflora , alter , know relatively stable ; mucosal damage occur may become permanent . Objectives Objective # 1 : Estimate burden disease due chronic gastrointestinal illness PG veteran . Hypothesis : . The prevalence GI symptom high PG veteran . ii . The prevalence IBS high veteran report acute gastroenteritis period deployment . iii . PG Veterans IBS low IBS related QOL Objective # 2 : Evaluate whether SBBO associate chronic diarrhea PG veteran . Hypothesis i. SBBO common PG veteran non deploy veteran . ii . SBBO common PG veteran diarrhea-predominant IBS vs. without . Objective : # 3 : Determine whether eradication SBBO reduce symptom chronic diarrhea , abdominal pain bloat PG Veterans . Hypothesis : . Treatment rifaximin , non-absorbable antibiotic , improve symptom QOL Veterans SBBO .</detailed_description>
