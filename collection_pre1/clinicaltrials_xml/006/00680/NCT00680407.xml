	<brief_summary>Silymarin , also know milk thistle , alternative medicine commonly find health food vitamin store . People liver disease sometimes use silymarin think liver protecting effect ; however , benefit proven . The purpose research study determine effectiveness silymarin assess safety different silymarin dose patient vary severity liver disease compare placebo ( lactose pill ) . Following screen visit , patient histologically confirm NASH randomize either placebo one two active treatment group silymarin ( Legalon® ) . One active treatment group receive 420 mg , dose give three time daily , active treatment group receive 700 mg , dose give three time daily . Patients treat 48-50 week . Participation research study require patient travel clinic least 11 visit recruitment limit geographically restrict area around participate clinical center . Liver biopsy must perform 12 month prior , immediately , treatment phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Silymarin Non-Cirrhotic Patients With Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double mask , placebo control Phase II trial evaluate safety explore efficacy silymarin ( Legalon® ) compare placebo hepatic histology patient NASH ( nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ) 48-50 week therapy . This study originally sponsor cooperative agreement ( U01 ) award NCCAM NIDDK ( RFA-AT-05-006 : `` Phase I/II Trials Silymarin Chronic Liver Diseases '' ) , continue Madaus Inc. ( Rottapharm Group ) provide financial regulatory support investigator . The broad aim study evaluate safety explore efficacy silymarin ( Legalon® ) NASH patient form basis future study establish efficacy treat patient NASH . The specific objective study determine effect silymarin ( Legalon® ) histologic NASH Activity Score ( NAS ) , liver enzymes , HOMAr . The primary endpoint study improvement NAS least 2 point . Various secondary endpoint assess , include change liver enzymes HOMAr .</detailed_description>
