	<brief_summary>Our previous collaborative study develop molecular diagnosis tool , characterize prediction model consist single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , assess efficacy interferon combine therapy chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) patient prior treatment . Aims project : 1 . To analyze validate gene expression profile dependent treatment response peg-interferon-Î± plus ribavirin combination therapy CHC genotype-1 patient . 2 . To select candidate gene establish monitoring model assess efficacy interferon treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A combination pegylated-interferon ( PEG-IFN ) ribavirin choice treat chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) patient . In addition high cost , treatment take 6 12 month often bring significant adverse reaction patient . It would therefore beneficial include pre-treatment evaluation post-treatment monitoring system maximize efficacy CHC therapy . We establish molecular diagnosis tool assess efficacy interferon combine therapy CHC patient prior treatment . This diagnostic tool characterize prediction model consist single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) strongly associate interferon efficacy treat CHC patient . The prediction model validate hepatitis C sample Taiwan , achieve 80 % accuracy , high current efficacy rate . Supplemented viral genotype information would increase prediction accuracy 85 % . In project , aim analyze patient ' gene expression profile treatment . The current study focus 30 PEG-IFN ribavirin treat patient HCV genotype 1 infection . After respond status patient confirm , compare gene expression profile among different response treatment . By use information , properly select candidate gene , establish monitoring model biomarkers . This monitoring model thus apply assess efficacy PEG-IFN plus ribavirin combination treatment .</detailed_description>
