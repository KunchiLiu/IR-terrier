	<brief_summary>The goal study find safety inject gene ( DNA ) mouse TYRP2 patient melanoma . DNA material contain information need produce many substance body . TYRP2 substance find melanoma cell help produce black color . The DNA use study gene mouse TYRP2 . The gene introduce bacteria , grown large quantity . The DNA vaccine make bacteria inactive . We would like see immunize patient TYRP2 inject mouse TYRP2 DNA . We also follow patient closely see side effect . Mouse TYRP2 DNA similar human TYRP2 DNA . We believe , base lab experiment , injection mouse TYRP2 DNA could result production immune substance ( antibody T cell ) recognize melanoma cell . Antibodies substance produce immune system defend body bacteria virus . T cell type white blood cell also fight infection . The small difference mouse human TYRP2 may allow immune system make antibody T cell melanoma . There evidence yet injection TYRP2 DNA result clinical benefit patient .</brief_summary>
