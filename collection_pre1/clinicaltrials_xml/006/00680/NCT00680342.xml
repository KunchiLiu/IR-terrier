	<brief_summary>Silymarin ( Legalon ) , also know milk thistle , alternative medicine commonly find health food vitamin store . People liver disease sometimes use silymarin think liver protecting effect ; however , benefit proven . The purpose research study determine effectiveness silymarin assess safety different silymarin dose patient vary severity liver disease compare placebo ( lactose pill ) . Eligible subject randomize treatment placebo one two dosage Legalon® 420 mg 700 mg administer orally thrice daily . Investigators subject masked treatment assignment . The study design include screening period patient undergo full medical evaluation verify protocol eligibility treatment period 24 week time clinic visit laboratory study perform every 2-4 week monitor safety efficacy therapy . Subjects continue follow additional 12 week completion study medication monitor adverse event investigate post-treatment outcome . Participation research study require subject travel clinic least 10 visit recruitment limit geographically restrict area around participate clinical center .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Silymarin Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Who Have Failed Conventional Antiviral Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal phase II study evaluate safety efficacy silymarin treatment subject chronic hepatitis C respond conventional antiviral therapy . The primary objective study assess safety adverse event profile silymarin range dos compare placebo ass efficacy silymarin normalize serum aminotransferase activity patient chronic hepatitis C. Secondary objective characterize effect silymarin serum level HCV RNA explore relationships silymarin therapy serum biomarkers HCV hepatic disease activity ( oxidative stress , apoptosis , fibrogenesis ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age least 18 year screen . Serum HCV RNA quantifiable level detection assay end previous therapy . ALT &gt; 65 IU/L ( i.e. , approximately 1.5 X upper limit normal ) obtain screening period . Previous treatment interferonbased therapy without sustained virological response . Negative urine pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) document within 24hour period prior first dose silymarin . Females childbearing potential must use two reliable form effective contraception study ( drug followup ) . Use silymarin milk thistle preparation within 30 day prior screen . Use antioxidants vitamin E , vitamin C , glutathione , alphatocopherol , nonprescribed complementary alternative medication ( include dietary supplement , megadose vitamin , herbal preparation , special tea ) within 30 day prior screen . A multivitamin standard dose allow . Use silymarin antioxidant nonprescribed complementary alternative medication ( ) screen period patient unwilling refrain take medication completion study . Any antiviral therapy within 6 month prior screen visit . Known allergy/sensitivity milk thistle preparation . Evidence poorlycontrolled diabetes ( define HbA1c &gt; 8 % patient diabetes ) . Use warfarin , metronidazole acetaminophen ( great two gram per day ) within 30 day screen . Lactose intolerance define patient report inability tolerate milk product . Previous liver biopsy demonstrate presence moderate severe steatosis evidence steatohepatitis . Positive test antiHIV HBsAg within 5 year screen .

History evidence severe illness condition would make patient , opinion investigator , unsuitable study ( poorly control psychiatric disease , coronary artery disease , active gastrointestinal condition might interfere drug absorption ) . History immunologically mediate disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , lupus erythematosus , autoimmune hepatitis , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , severe psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis ) could affect inflammatory biomarkers . History solid organ bone marrow transplantation . History thyroid disease poorly control prescribed medication . Use oral steroid 14 day within 30 day prior screen .
