	<brief_title>Prospective Study Scoliosis Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bracing severe neuromuscular scoliotic curve rarely serve definitive treatment , thus progressive curve require surgical intervention order sustain improve sitting ( ambulatory ) ability . Surgery demand intervention patient , variable functional gain . Controversy persist regard indication surgery , timing , technique . Concerns complication paramount . Previous neuromuscular study confine small number surgeon narrow range surgical instrumentation , technique , correction . Very little evidence exists regard impact spinal surgery quality life child scoliosis relate cerebral palsy . The instrument measure quality life specific child scoliosis relate cerebral palsy . There comprehensive prospective study publish . This study would first large-scale prospective , multi-center series spinal fusion outcomes patient Cerebral Palsy .</detailed_description>
