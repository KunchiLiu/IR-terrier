	<brief_summary>Heart failure remain increase cause morbidity mortality United States even face recent advance treatment cardiovascular disease . There urgent need reevaluate treatment heart failure . Shifting substrate utilization use energy metabolism fatty acid glucose beneficial heart presumably increase efficiency ATP production . Several new drug treatment cardiac ischemia work mechanism . There increase evidence patient heart failure may also benefit type intervention . Patients heart failure know low serum thiamine level poor dietary intake increase urinary excretion . Inadequate thiamine deleteriously shift substrate utilization glucose fatty acid . We hypothesize thiamine supplementation beneficial patient heart failure increase glucose decrease fatty acid utilization . This initially test pilot double-blinded placebo control study thiamine supplementation diabetic non-diabetic patient present emergency department acute decompensated heart failure .</brief_summary>
