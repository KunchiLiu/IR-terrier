	<brief_summary>Chronic insomnia think occur result hyperarousal . While wealth data support position , lack research define hyperarousal interfere sleep initiation , maintenance , perception sleep quality quantity . We propose use Event-related Potential ( ERP ) techniques evaluate information processing sleep onset sleep . ERP measure information processing well established good sleeper ; , however , apply problem insomnia . The goal project examine premise occurrence severity insomnia fundamentally relate neurobiologic preparedness `` attend '' `` identify '' environmental stimulus . Following extensive screening , patient insomnia good sleeper participate two experimental condition , require spend four night sleep laboratory two week period . ERP data gather prior , follow , sleep . The ultimate objective line research determine 1 ) insomnia associate failure inhibit information processing sleep onset and/or sleep , 2 ) failure inhibit information processing sleep onset and/or sleep associate occurrence and/or severity insomnia symptom , 3 ) brain region function differently give rise information processing abnormality , 4 ) extent pharmacologic and/or Cognitive Behavioral treatment insomnia alters information processing abnormality and/or associate brain activity .</brief_summary>
