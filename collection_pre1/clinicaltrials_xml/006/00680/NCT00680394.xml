	<brief_summary>A double blind , placebo-controlled randomize trial compare safety , efficacy acceptability two medical abortion regimens 63 day ' LMP . The first regimen include 200 mg oral dose mifepristone follow 800 mcg buccal misoprostol . The second regimen include two 800 mcg dos buccal misoprostol . We hypthesize method work well , mifepristone regimen efficacy rate approximately 95 % , misoprostol alone closer 90 % . We consider great 5 % difference clinically meaningful .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Two Regimens Medical Abortion : Mifepristone+Misoprostol Versus Misoprostol Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-surgical abortion method potential improve quality safety woman 's reproductive health develop world . However , recently , widespread availability utilization medical abortion mifepristone low resource country restrict limited availability mifepristone perceive high cost drug , low vary rate efficacy misoprostol alone regimen hinder widespread adoption . In recent year , handful new mifepristone misoprostol product come market , ease availability reduce cost drug , therefore make introduction new setting feasible . Nonetheless , mifepristone much expensive misoprostol ( approximately $ 4 - 6 tablet versus $ 0.35 tablet ) often large part cost medical abortion cost . In respect , study provide important opportunity well understand real difference efficacy two regimen addition cost benefit two non-surgical abortion regimen . The study contribute greatly literature medical abortion . First , first randomize trial compare two buccal regimen ( second ever compare mifepristone+misoprostol misoprostol alone . Second , proven efficacious , promise offer alternative regimen use woman gestation 63 day ' LMP . Third , may create evidence support shorten time abortion completion , offer woman mifepristone arm chance complete abortion 24 hour mifepristone , instead standard 48 hour later . Lastly , provide unique opportunity systematically non-biased manner , compare side effect acceptability two regimen , thereby create information help provider policy maker debate relative cost benefit two medical abortion regimen . A total 700 woman recruit . We assume efficacy mifepristone plus buccal misoprostol approximately 95 % . The efficacy misoprostol alone medical abortion , via vaginal route , 88 % . The efficacy misoprostol alone via buccal route know , efficacy via buccal route repeat dose 24 hour interval . We expect efficacy buccal misoprostol similar vaginal misoprostol base pharmokinetic clinical data . We assume efficacy mifepristone plus buccal misoprostol research settings 95 % . A difference efficacy buccal misoprostol alone least 5 % ( 90 % ) clinically meaningful provider woman . Using alpha = 0.05 one-sided test power = 0.80 , number need demonstrate difference 664 ( 334 arm ) . Assuming 5 % drop complete protocol , plan enroll total 700 woman . The primary endpoint efficacy ; safety , acceptability side effect assess secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
