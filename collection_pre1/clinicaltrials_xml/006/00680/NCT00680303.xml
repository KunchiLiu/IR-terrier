Although approximately 71.4 % child whose stutter onset preschool year exhibit spontaneous recovery within two year first report onset , remain significant number child require fluency intervention . Given potential negative long term social communicative consequence due persistent stuttering , consensus among speech-language pathologist stutter treat early . However , long child 's stuttering persists , less likely child spontaneously recover . The Lidcombe Program behavioral therapy program preschool child design treat stutter early stage . The treatment approach involve direct participation parent , train parent child weekly visit speech language pathologist .

When child 's stuttering reduce near-zero level , child enters second stage program , number clinic visit gradually phase bi-monthly monthly every 2 month , , require child . The purpose stage 2 visit speech language pathologist evaluate child 's speech ensure near-zero stuttering level maintain . When first stage Lidcombe program follow program originally design , median treatment time achieve criterion near-zero level stutter 11 one-hour weekly clinic visit , treatment time vary accord severity stuttering . However , clinician deviate standard weekly session various reason . For instance , private practitioner offer first stage treatment visit every 2 week rather weekly practitioner offer treatment intensively , client remote area access Lidcombe program . As yet , data confirm whether treatment use fortnightly twice weekly clinic visit effective efficient standard weekly visit . The aim project evaluate follow question : ( 1 ) Does alter space LP clinic visit affect treatment efficiency ?
