	<brief_title>Reveal速 XT Performance Trial ( XPECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , non-randomized , multi-center international post-market study . The study conduct 20-30 center primarily Europe . The study conduct least Germany , Austria , Switzerland , The Netherlands , Czech Republic . Study center Canada may also participate , depend timeline regulatory approval commercial release Reveal速 XT region . It expect 140 200 patient enrolled ensure least 47 patient include assess first primary objective least 60 patient assess second primary objective . The primary objective quantify AF detection performance device . The patient population assess two separate cohort . The first primary objective quantify 24-hour AF burden accuracy patient 1 % AF burden . The second primary objective quantify detection accuracy non-arrhythmia patient 1 % less AF burden .</detailed_description>
