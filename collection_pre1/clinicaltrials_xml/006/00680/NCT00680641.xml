	<brief_title>Simvastatin Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins ( HMG-Coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ) widely use clinically lipid lower drug ; however also show exhibit anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant property ( 1 ) . Recently publish large retrospective cohort study , patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , suggest statin reduce mortality COPD related admission ( 2 ) . Possible mechanisms action include effect cell adhesion molecule , change inflammatory mediator release , antioxidant effect increase clearance apoptoic cell . Simvastatin show reduce development smoking induce emphysema rat reduction MMP-9 activity simvastatin withdrawal lead increase MMP level hypercholesterolaemic patient . Serum concentration TNFa high sensitive C Reactive protein ( 3 ) ( hs-CRP ) reduce simvastatin therapy patient hypercholesterolaemia risk cardiovascular disease respectively . No clinical trial directly evaluate clinical effect statins patient COPD term induce sputum MMP profile , alveolar nitric oxide pulmonary physiology . We modify publish method RNA purification , develop purify RNA cartilage , tendon synovium ( 4 ) , yield good quality RNA sputum relative simplicity low cost . We identify MMP-2 , -9 -14 sputum healthy volunteer ( unpublished pilot data ) utilise technique current study . Exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) completely non-invasive , require co-operation individual provide information number inflammatory oxidation pathway . Markers oxidative stress ( 8-isoprostane hydrogen peroxide ) nitric oxide product measure exhale breath condensate ( 5 ) relate disease activity patient COPD . Markers oxidative stress increase concentration EBC exacerbation COPD reduce treatment antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine ( 6 ) . Hydrogen peroxide stable therefore 8-isoprostane preferable marker oxidative stress unless sample measure line .</detailed_description>
