	<brief_title>The Effect Preoperative Docetaxel , Cisplatin Capecitabine Serum RUNX3 Hypermethylation Status Patients With Gastric Lower Oesophagus Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Pre-operative chemotherapy size stage tumours prior surgery improves treatment outcome . However , current chemotherapy regime require long terrn venous access protract chemotherapy infusion . Despite encouraging response rate , still substantial number achieve curative resection pre-operative chemotherapy . Hence need develop 1 ) convenient effective regimen 2 ) surrogate treatment response non-responder identify early . Specific aim : To assess radiological response , curative resection rate preoperative docetaxel/cisplatin capecitabine patient Stage II &amp; III gastric low oesophageal adenocarcinoma correlate treatment response serum RUNX3 methylation status . Hypotheses : We hypothesize propose preoperative regimen effective gastric cancer safely deliver . In addition , RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation status surrogate treatment response . Methodology : This phase II study design assess response tolerability preoperative docetaxel , cisplatin capecitabine patient operable gastric cancer . Simon 's two-stage design use calculate sample size Phase II trial , use two level response rate , P0 ( 20 % ) P1 ( 50 % ) . Accordingly , 20 patient require study ; 8 patient accrue first stage follow 12 patient three response observe first stage . The alpha level design 0.04 power 0.86 . Serum measurement tumour 's RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation perform prior treatment cycle evaluate role biomarker treatment response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma stomach lower third oesophagusthat consider stage II ( submucosa ) high , evidence distant metastasis , locally advance inoperable disease , evaluate compute tomography , chest radiography , ultrasonography , laparoscopy . Patients must evaluable measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; = 20 mm conventional technique &gt; = 10 mm spiral CT scan . Age &gt; = 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use DCX patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status &lt; = 1 ( see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : X leukocytes &gt; = 3,000/mcL X absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mcL X platelet &gt; = 100,000/mcL X total bilirubin within normal institutional limit X AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal X creatinine within normal institutional limit The effect DCX develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients prior chemotherapy radiotherapy . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients stage I IV cancer stomach low oesophagus . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition docetacel , cisplatin capecitabine . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study agent use study may cause fetal harm . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction docetaxel . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
