	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety transfusion specialize white cell transplant donor 's blood , call T-cells , grown immunized CMV virus test tube . If transplant donor immune CMV ( ie : donor antibody CMV blood ) , T-cells select grown blood transplant donor . However , transplant donor immune CMV , T-cells donor readily available , CMV-immune T-cells grown blood another normal donor partially match patient tissue type use . The transplant physician explain treatment available patient . This trial call phase I trial phase I trial design test safety different dos experimental treatment . We want find effect , good and/or bad , dose/doses immune T-cells patient CMV infection . Specifically , wish test CMV immune T-cells grown blood use new method develop center . In method , fragment important CMV protein , call CMVpp65 , chemically synthesize use immunize T-cells test tube .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Prior receive treatment , patient may undergo diagnostic and/or test tissue , available , determine CMV infect cell likely respond treatment CMV specific T cell . Alternatively , blood sample may require research test ascertain CMVspecific Tcells contain cell could react patient . These patient sign separate pretreatment consent . If determine patient qualify might benefit infusion CMV CTLs , he/she go sign standard treatment consent MSKCC IRB # 05065 enrol treat trial , eligibility criterion meet . Each patient must satisfy least one follow criterion : The patient must clinically document condition associate CMV ( e.g . interstitial pneumonia , hepatitis , retinitis ) The patient must microbiological evidence CMV viremia tissue invasion attest viral culture , detection CMV antigenemia detection level CMV DNA blood body fluids consistent CMV infection . The patient 's CMV infection clinically progress CMV viremia persistent increase ( evidence quantitation CMV antigenemia CMV DNA blood ) despite two week induction therapy antiviral drug . The patient develop CMV viremia attest viral culture , detection CMV antigenemia detection level CMV DNA blood body fluid receive prophylactic dos antiviral drug prevent CMV infection post transplant . patient unable sustain treatment antiviral drug due drug associate toxicity ( e.g . myelosuppression [ ANC &lt; 1000 ul/ml without GCSF support ] nephrotoxicity [ correct creatinine clearance &lt; equal 60ml/min/1.73m2 creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl ] ) . Because CMV infection lifethreatening may involve lung , liver , gastrointestinal tract , hematopoietic central nervous system , antiviral drug may also compromise renal hematopoietic function , dysfunction organ affect eligibility protocol . However , eligible , patient meet follow clinical criterion : They must stable blood pressure circulation , require pressor support . They adequate cardiac function demonstrate EKG and/or echocardiographic evidence . They life expectancy , even require respirator support , least 3 week . They age restriction eligibility protocol . Patients require high dos glucocorticosteroids ( &gt; 0.5 mg/kg prednisone equivalent ) treatment active ( grade 24 ) acute graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) chronic GVHD . Patients moribund . Patients condition related CMV infection ( e.g . uncontrolled bacterial sepsis invasive fungal infection ) also lifethreatening would preclude evaluation effect T cell infusion . Donor Eligibility Donation Blood Lymphocytes Generation DonorDerived CMVSpecific T cell : Adequate health donation determine institutional ( related donor ) NMDP ( unrelated donor ) guideline . Normal donor evaluate evidence prior sensitization CMV CMV serology . They also type HLA A , B , C DR. For allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipient , marrow transplant donor constitute donor choice , since Tcells grow persist patient already engraft transplant donor . However , HSCT donor CMV seronegative available ( e.g . cord blood transplant unrelated donor already donate Tcells adoptive therapy ) , CMVspecific Tcells generate seropositive donor match least 2 HLA allele share patient may use . Normal donor fulfil criterion consent donate blood generation CMVspecific Tcells adoptive therapeutic purpose receive detailed clinical evaluation , include medical history , physical examination , serologic test transmissible disease within 1 week donation include hepBs Ag hepatitis C antibody , HIV1 2 , HTLV1 2 , CMV ( previously negative ) , VDRL , WNV , Chagas An HIV+ donor reject medical ground . Donors must Hgb value &gt; 10 gm/dl must capable undergoing single 36 unit leukapheresis ( preferable ) single unit blood T cell ( pediatric donor , 5 ml/kg one blood draw ) . A prospective donor inform purpose study , requirement . If he/she consent , donor request provide two blood sample : . An initial donation 25ml blood anticoagulated heparin ACD . This blood use establish B cell line transform B95.8 laboratory strain EBV . This EBV+ B cell line/ ( EBVBLCL ) use antigenpresenting cell . When loaded pool CMVpp65 pentadecapeptides , EBVBLCL efficiently sensitize T cell donor CMV well EBV . Because establishment test EBV transform B cell line suitable use antigenpresenting cell require 45 week vitro culture , important sample obtain early possible patient risk CMV infection . Because patient receive HSCT unrelated HLA disparate donor particularly risk severe CMV infection first 23 month transplant , blood sample obtain donor prior donation hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant whenever possible . ii . A donation either single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis collect standard ACD anticoagulant . If impossible collect leukapheresis donor , unit whole blood acceptable . However , AICTF ( Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility manufacture clinical grade cell product GMP condition MSKCC ) may able generate limit number T cell unit blood . This blood require isolation T cell sensitize pool CMVpp65 15mers load autologous EBVBLCL , propagate vitro . In addition , require provide autologous feeder cell essential sustain Tcell growth without risk stimulate growth alloreactive Tcells capable induce GVHD . This donation leukapheresis unit blood obtain unrelated HSCT donor least 2 week donation HSCT , soon possible thereafter . In order limit number blood leukapheresis donation would require donor , donor inform follow potential application blood cell donate . The white cell contain one leukapheresis sufficient grow enough T cell treat three condition transplant patient : 1 . The use cell generate CMVspecific Tcells potential use treatment patient donor provide HSCT , MSKCC IRB # 05065 . 2 . The use fraction cell isolated generate : 1. immune Tcells specific another virus , EpsteinBarr virus , cause lethal lymphoma transplant recipient , 2. immune Tcells specific protein call WT1 , differentially express malignant blood cell . Such Tcells could use , separate protocol , treat EBV associate disease ( IRB 95024 ) and/or treat prevent leukemia recurrence ( 07055 ) patient receive donor 's hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant . 3 . The donation immune Tcells generate donor use require patient originally intend bank immune cell store maintain cryopreserved GMP condition Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility MSKCC , These store Tcells , may use treatment patient CMV EBV infections/malignancies express HLA allele share donor . In addition prospectively accrued donor , , since initiation protocol , generate 100 CMVspecific Tcells patient high risk infection , far few patient require treatment . Since patient beyond period risk CMV infection , donor approach separate consent allow use T cell recipient primary patient initially donate cell .</criteria>
