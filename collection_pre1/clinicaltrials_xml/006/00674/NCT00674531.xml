	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis one first cause morbidity-mortality industrialized country . Numerous work suggest infectious agent could involve inflammatory process lead development pathology , Chlamydophila pneumoniae , cytomegalovirus herpes simplex virus . Enteroviruses small RNA virus incriminate various acute chronic cardiac disease ( pericarditis , myocarditis , dilate cardiomyopathy ) exhibit tropism vascular endothelium . Different clinical experimental argument suggest could play cofactor role occurrence maintenance atherosclerosis lesion . A multicenter study develop collaboration colleague University Hospital Reims ( France ) show frequent detect enterovirus RNA cardiac biopsy patient myocardial infarction . Furthermore , pilot study conduct University Hospital Saint-Etienne ( France ) atheromatous arterial sample 18 patient allow detection enterovirus RNA 20 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : In order complete data answer clearly question role persistent infection enteroviruses atherosclerosis , propose research program involve Departments Vascular Surgery three University hospital `` Rhône-Alpes '' region three laboratory Virology interested relationship chronic disease enterovirus infection.. Methods : It project include one hundred voluntary adult exhibit carotid atheromatous lesion require surgical removal . Because difficulty define pertinent control group , patient his/her control . In addition fragment pathologic carotid , take arterial venous fragment vessel never seat atherosclerosis lesion . To reach best sensitivity , enterovirus RNA detect nested RT-PCR . Evaluation criterion : The main evaluation criterion percentage detection enterovirus RNA RT-PCR atheromatous lesion comparison control arteries Mac-Nemar test . These result correlate anatomic histological lesion atheromatous plaque . Other marker analyse secondarily : detection enterovirus RNA control venous sample , detection stigma viral replication immunochemistry detection negative RNA strand , analysis antibody response enterovirus blood , molecular typing enterovirus detect lesions… Expected benefit : This study allow good understand putative involvement enteroviruses atherosclerosis-linked disease . If hypothesis relationship confirm , ambitious research project would propose order investigate mechanism enterovirus favour atherosclerosis discus opportunity preventive strategy ( notably vaccination ) reduce risk .</detailed_description>
