	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Exemestane may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . ATN-224 may stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give exemestane together ATN-224 effective give exemestane alone treat patient recurrent advance breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect exemestane give together without ATN-224 see well work treat postmenopausal woman recurrent advance breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exemestane With Without ATN-224 Treating Postmenopausal Women With Recurrent Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival postmenopausal woman , estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive recurrent advance breast cancer treat exemestane versus without SOD1 inhibitor ATN-224 . - Establish safety SOD1 inhibitor ATN-224 combination exemestane patient . Secondary - Determine response rate ( overall , 16 24 week ) , response duration , rate stable disease ≥ 16 ≥ 24 week patient . - Determine clinical benefit rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease ) 16 24 week patient . - Investigate time course suppression serum ceruloplasmin ( Cp , surrogate copper ) . - Investigate serum estradiol estrone sulphate level patient assess SOD1 inhibitor ATN-224 interact aromatase inhibition exemestane . Tertiary - Investigate pharmacokinetic behavior SOD1 inhibitor ATN-224 combination exemestane . - Investigate superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) activity red blood cell cytokine level plasma sample patient . - Investigate circulate endothelial cell level , circulate endothelial RNA level , proteome profile blood sample baseline treatment , patient . - Investigate SOD1 , lysyl oxidase copper-dependent protein expression , endothelial growth factor receptor-related cell-signaling pathway historical tumor sample patient enter study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior aromatase inhibitor therapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral exemestane oral SOD1 inhibitor ATN-224 daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral exemestane daily . In arm , treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic assessment , include Cp level , estradiol estrone sulfate , SOD1 level , cytokine , proteomics , circulate endothelial RNA , circulate endothelial cell , protein expression , EGFR-related cell signal pathway . After completion study treatment patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
