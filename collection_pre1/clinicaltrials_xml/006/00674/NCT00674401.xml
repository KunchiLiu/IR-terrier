	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Drivers Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia clinical practice , account one-third arrhythmia hospitalization associate increase risk stroke , heart failure , all-cause mortality . Moreover , increase AF prevalence due age population , rise prevalence chronic heart disease , increase survival . Unfortunately , medication aim suppress AF maintain sinus rhythm control ventricular rate marginally effective may cause serious adverse effect . The limitation pharmacologic treatment pattern fuel development new interventional strategy . Current techniques AF ablation achieve 60-80 % improvement highly select patient medically refractory AF . However , procedure without risk , long-lasting recurrence rate still high . Moreover , result persistent AF patient far optimal , require creation extensive atrial lesion repeat procedure . The main reason explain current situation incomplete understand mechanism underlie AF maintenance despite many year research speculation . The incremental value ablation high frequency source follow circumferential PV isolation assess . There prospective data available safety benefit combined approach patient paroxysmal persistent AF . Such information would important help guide future direction ablative therapy AF well help answer important question role high frequency site persistent AF treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 18 old . Patients paroxysmal AF symptomatic refractory least one antiarrhythmic medication . In patient paroxysmal AF , least one episode AF must document ECG Holter within 12 month randomization trial . Patients persistent AF define sustained episode present seven day without intervene spontaneous episode sinus rhythm recur within seven day cardioversion . Patients persistent AF must continuous anticoagulation warfarin ( INR 23 ) &gt; 4 week prior ablation . In patient paroxysmal AF continuous anticoagulation therapy warfarin &gt; 4 week prior ablation need provide transesophageal echocardiogram perform prior ablation exclude presence thrombus abnormality discourage performing procedure . Patients must able willing provide write informed consent participate clinical trial . Patients AF secondary reversible cause . Patients inadequate anticoagulation level define inclusion criterion . Patients leave atrial thrombus , tumor , another abnormality preclude catheter introduction TEE prior procedure . Patients contraindication systemic anticoagulation heparin coumadin . Patients previously undergone atrial fibrillation ablation , either surgery percutaneous catheter . Patients leave atrial size &gt; 55 mm . Patients may potentially pregnant . Patients hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism . Current enrollment another investigational drug device study . Pacemaker Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator .</criteria>
