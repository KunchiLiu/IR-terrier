	<brief_summary>1 . To find optimal dose topotecan safely give directly spinal fluid ( call intrathecal administration ) child whose cancer spread line brain and/or spinal cord . 2 . To find effect ( good bad ) topotecan give directly cerebrospinal fluid child neoplastic meningitis ( cancer spread line brain spinal cord ) . - Cerebrospinal fluid fluid circulate around brain spinal cord . 3 . To determine intrathecal topotecan beneficial patient . 4 . To good understand topotecan handle body intrathecal administration . 5 . To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid sign ( marker ) tumor spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Intrathecal Topotecan Neoplastic Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , non-randomized pharmacokinetically-guided optimal dosing study intraventricular topotecan child neoplastic meningitis . Topotecan administer daily five consecutive day utilize schema show Schema . Concomitant chemotherapy control systemic disease bulk CNS disease allowable provide systemic chemotherapy investigational agent one following : high-dose methotrexate ( &gt; 1g/m2 ) , high-dose cytarabine ( &gt; 1g/m2 ) , 5-fluorouracil , capecitabine , thiotepa , nitrosourea , topotecan . The start dose trial derive pharmacokinetic simulation utilize data prior phase I study intrathecal topotecan . The simulation perform estimate length time ventricular CSF concentration topotecan lactone would remain optimal `` target level '' 1 ng/mL . One primary objective study estimate dose intrathecal topotecan result CSF lactone concentration exceed 1 ng/mL least eight hour intrathecal injection . Dose escalation patient cohort conduct follow traditional phase 1 design order determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The MTD call pharmacokinetically optimal dose achieves target PK parameter least 23 25 patient treat dose level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age : Patients must great equal 3 year less equal 21 year age study registration . 2 . Diagnosis : Patients must neoplastic meningitis secondary underlying leukemia/lymphoma solid tumor ( include primary CNS tumor carcinomas unknown primary site ) conventional therapy . Patients CNS leukemia/lymphoma must refractory conventional therapy , include XRT ( i.e. , 2nd great relapse ) . Neoplastic meningitis define follow : ( ) Leukemia/Lymphoma : CSF cell count 5/ÂµL AND evidence blast cell cytospin preparation cytology ( b ) Solid tumor : Presence tumor cell cytospin preparation cytology OR unequivocal presence meningeal disease MRI scan . 3 . Patients leukemia/lymphoma : Patients CNS leukemia lymphoma must negative bone marrow aspirate assess within two week prior registration . 4 . Performance Status ( Appendix III full protocol ) : Karnofsky Performance Scale ( KPS great 16 yrs age ) Lansky Performance Score ( LPS le equal 16 year age ) great equal 60 assess within two week prior registration . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose performance score . 5 . Recovery Prior Therapy : Patients must recover acute neurotoxic effect prior chemotherapy , biological therapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study must without uncontrolled significant systemic illness 5.1 Chemo : 1 . Patients must receive last dose systemically administer therapy specifically treatment leptomeningeal disease ( must discuss study chair ) least three ( 3 ) week prior study registration . 2 . Patients must receive last dose intrathecal therapy least one ( 1 ) week ( 2 week intrathecal DepoCyt ) prior study registration . 5.2 XRT : Patients must last fraction craniospinal irradiation great equal 8 week prior study registration . 6 . The following laboratory value must assess within two ( 2 ) week prior registration . Laboratory test repeat within 48 hour begin therapy , significant clinical change . 6.1 Electrolytes : 1 . Sodium : great equal 125 less equal 150 mmol/L 2 . Calcium : great equal 7 mg/dL 3 . Magnesium : great equal 0.7 mmol/L 7 . Intraventricular access device : Patients must willing intraventricular access device Ommaya reservoir . 8 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test prior registration . Patient must breastfeed . 9 . Patients childbearing child father potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . 10 . Signed informed consent accord institutional guideline must obtain . 1 . CSF Flow : Patients clinical evidence obstructive hydrocephalus eligible protocol . Patients compartmentalization CSF flow , document radioisotope Indium111 Technetium99DTPA flow study eligible protocol . Requirement CSF flow study : 1.1 Solid CNS tumor patient : Nuclear medicine CSF flow study require within 7 day prior registration patient underlie solid CNS tumor . Informed consent must obtain prior CSF flow study . 1.2 Leukemia lymphoma patient : Nuclear medicine CSF flow study require CSF analysis MRI suggest may blockage CSF flow . The study must obtain within 7 day prior registration . Informed consent must obtain prior CSF flow study . 2 . Underlying illness : Patients significant medical illness , investigator 's opinion , adequately controlled appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . 3 . Concomitant Therapy Patients receive therapy ( either intrathecal systemic ) design treat leptomeningeal disease eligible study . Note : Patients receive concomitant chemotherapy control systemic disease bulk CNS disease eligible , provide systemic chemotherapy investigational agent one following : highdose methotrexate ( &gt; 1g/m2 ) , highdose cytarabine ( &gt; 1g/m2 ) , 5fluorouracil , capecitabine , thiotepa , nitrosourea , topotecan . Please discuss plan systemic therapy Study Chair prior study entry . 4 . Patients ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) ventriculoatrial ( VA ) shunt eligible unless completely shuntindependent , e.g. , shunt on/off valve always `` '' position . 5 . Patients must free uncontrolled infection , except HIV patient AIDSrelated lymphomatous meningitis . 6 . Patients currently receive receive investigational agent within the14 day prior study registration . The 14 day period extend investigational agent know delayed toxicity . 7 . Patients impend spinal cord compression CNS involvement require emergent local XRT ( e.g. , acute visual loss secondary optic nerve involvement ) . 8 . Patients receive concomitant radiation therapy CNS . Note : Patients may receive radiation therapy extraCNS site , e.g . painful bone metastases craniospinal axis .</criteria>
