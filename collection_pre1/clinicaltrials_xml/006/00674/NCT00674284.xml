	<brief_title>Adrenal Exhaustion Syndrome Critically Ill Patients Without Improvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated corticosteroid level meet physiologic need acute illness protective response stress . This homeostasis maintain hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis . However , inadequate response corticosteroid insufficiency critically ill patient report increase frequency , especially severe sepsis septic shock . Thus , corticosteroid could beneficial septic shock severe acute illness . Once consider normal adrenal function , adrenal insufficiency may develop later chronic critical illness adrenal exhaustion syndrome . It easily overlook possible due chronic secretion systemic cytokine HPA axis-suppressive substance . There still consensus often adrenal function test repeat , although re-evaluation consider clinical symptom sign suggest adrenal insufficiency deteriorate clinical condition .</detailed_description>
