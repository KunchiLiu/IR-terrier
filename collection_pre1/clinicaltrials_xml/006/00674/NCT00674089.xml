	<brief_summary>Vitamin A essential micronutrient normal function visual system , growth development , immunity reproduction . Its deficiency cause anemia , growth retardation xerophthalmia . Vitamin A deficiency also increase incidence and/or severity infectious episode affect child survival . Reduced child survival severe potentially widespread consequence Vitamin A deficiency . Improvement vitamin A status regard one cost effective preventive measure reduction child mortality morbidity . Over past decade several study examine effect vitamin A reducing mortality among child age ≥6months time intervention . Impact vitamin A supplementation significantly reduce total mortality establish supplementation program child age 6 month old . It assume breast milk protects infant vitamin A deficiency , recent evidence challenge . Infants born low store vitamin A mother breast milk low concentration vitamin A , find develop country , infant might unable meet daily requirement improve body reserve . There association mortality degree vitamin A deficiency , great degree deficiency , high mortality . The role vitamin A child survival well establish 60 country vitamin A supplementation program nationally . However , still use vitamin A supplement second half infancy , even though 75 % 5 death take place first 6 month life . If neonatal vitamin A supplementation find effective service delivery mechanism also find , represent major advance reach MDG 4 target . This thus persuasive reason explore particular preventive strategy , especially term package postnatal care activity . However , give instance difficult disentangle effect vitamin A dosing concomitant vaccination BCG , current evidence need evaluation effectiveness setting . We propose evaluate effectiveness early neonatal vitamin A administration ( single dose 50,000 unit ) newborn see effect infant mortality le 6 month age part postnatal package National Program . Government launch National Program Family Planning Primary Health Care since April 1994 . Primarily implement community Lady Health Workers ( LHWs ) National Program . The LHWs female , minimum eight year education , resident locality work . The Programme currently implement district throughout country 93,000 LHWs work cover primarily woman child rural population . These LHWs deliver service relate family planning , maternal child health , immunization , nutrition treatment minor ailment average registered population 100-150 household ~1000 population . Over 3,000 Supervisors recruit trained supervise work LHWs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Goal : To reduce infant mortality rate rural Pakistan evidence base intervention . Aim : To evaluate impact community-based neonatal Vitamin A supplementation program morbidity mortality newborns young infant ( 1-6 month age ) administer community level Primary objective : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness single dose 50,000 IU vitamin A supplementation newborn infant within 48 hour birth rural Punjab Sindh reduce mortality ( &lt; 6 month age ) ≥ 25 % . 2 . To evaluate feasibility neonatal vitamin A dosing administer LHW part postnatal care package Methodology : Study Design : Community base , cluster randomize , double blind , placebo control trial Sample size estimation : Assuming average infant mortality rate 40 per thousand live birth propose cluster without intervention ( range 30-50/1000 live birth ) , target 25 % reduction mortality first six month life , ( 5 % significance level 80 % power ) estimate indicate trial require total 360 cluster [ 180 arm ] . The average population size birth rate per LHW 1000 30 respectively Study Site : Districts Sukkhur Jehlum . Both district , represent typical mix peri-urban rural , multiethnic population Pakistan . Although public health care infrastructure exist , notable almost 60 % population seek care private health sector . Current rate immunization poor ( approximately 60 % ) largely population illiterate .</detailed_description>
