	<detailed_description>The evaluation ambulatory patient chest pain challenge serious problem , account significant proportion outpatient visit . High risk patient may go undetected , result miss diagnosis acute myocardial ischemia , low risk patient may subject unnecessary evaluation . To substantially improve evaluation treatment outpatient acute chest pain syndrome , new strategy need develop primary care set risk stratify symptomatic patient direct appropriate care . Our prior work demonstrates elevate Framingham Risk Score ( least 10 % ) reliably identifies patient chest pain primary care set high risk acute myocardial infarction . This study implement evaluate electronic risk alert risk stratify outpatient chest pain present information primary care clinician within context electronic health record . The intervention take place within Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates , multispecialty integrate group practice 140 primary care physician care approximately 300,000 patient 14 center eastern Massachusetts . With randomized , control study design , study three specific aim : - To identify predictor risk-appropriate evaluation treatment patient present primary care office acute chest pain , include race sex . - To determine whether rate appropriate evaluation treatment patient acute chest pain improved use point-of-care electronic risk alert provide individual patient cardiac risk profile tailor evaluation treatment recommendation primary care clinician . - To perform cost analysis provision electronic decision support patient acute chest pain . This study important implication determine treatment outpatient chest pain syndrome optimize innovative use electronic decision support , document cost implication strategy . This work also provide model ambulatory practice across country use electronic health record present real-time patient risk information clinician goal improve patient safety quality , important implication acute chronic care .</detailed_description>
