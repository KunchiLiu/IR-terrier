	<brief_summary>This study patient relapse disease allogeneic bone marrow The donor 's T cell activate exposure 2 compound antibody bind ( stick ) two compound T cell call CD3 CD28 . When antibody stick CD3 CD28 T cell , T cell becomes stimulate ( `` activate '' ) grow . CD3 CD28 coat T cell T cell part body 's immune system . It believe T cell expose antibody CD3 CD28 compound time , become activated `` stimulate '' may effective fight infection cancer cell . We call therapy `` activate donor lymphocyte infusion , activate DLI ( aDLI ) '' . This current study perform see whether safe effective administer high dos activate DLI repeat dos activate DLI . All patient receive standard donor lymphocyte infusion first , addition receive activate donor lymphocyte approximately 12 day later ( DLI follow aDLI ) . Depending response treatment , depend possible side effect ( graft-vs-host disease describe ) , patient remission receive additional aDLI every 3 month 4 time , patient remission within 6-12 week receive high dose aDLI .

	<brief_title>Trial Donor Lymphocyte Infusion ( DLI ) Activated DLI Following Relapse After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You ask participate research study disease relapse allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( put normal bone marrow one person another brother/sister , match family member , unrelated donor ) . This study test treatment relapse disease bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) use infusion bone marrow donor 's immune cell ( system protect body disease ) ; immune cell white blood cell call leukocyte lymphocyte ( call T cell ) . In allogeneic BMT , know donor 's immune system ( system protect body disease comprise primarily lymphocytes , white blood cell ) important control elimination leukemia bone marrow transplantation . Many study show treatment transfusion bone marrow donor 's lymphocyte lead complete remission patient relapse BMT . This procedure call donor lymphocyte infusion , `` DLI '' . The conventional standard way give donor lymphocyte infusion ( refer DLI ) take lymphocyte blood original bone marrow donor blood infuse directly patient relapse disease without process lymphocyte . Some patient good chance achieve remission donor lymphocyte infusion ( patient early stage CML ) . Standard DLI allogeneic BMT less effective patient advance leukemia ( AML , ALL , `` accelerate phase '' `` blast crisis '' CML ) , patient disease myelodysplasia , CLL , Hodgkin 's lymphoma non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Because disease , physician estimate chance less 4 10 ( 40 % ) less respond standard donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . In recent clinical trial , test safety new way give DLI might make treatment effective . The donor lymphocytes ( T cell ) activate laboratory give patient try make active . The donor 's T cell activate exposure 2 compound antibody bind ( stick ) two compound T cell call CD3 CD28 . When antibody stick CD3 CD28 T cell , T cell becomes stimulate ( `` activate '' ) grow . CD3 CD28 coat T cell T cell part body 's immune system . It believe T cell expose antibody CD3 CD28 compound time , become activated `` stimulate '' may effective fight infection cancer cell . We call therapy `` activate donor lymphocyte infusion , activate DLI ( aDLI ) '' . In previous study patient receive standard DLI aDLI , felt response least good conventional DLI patient treat know response might well . Unfortunately , note study use DLI , half patient respond , half patient remission later relapse disease . This current study perform see whether safe effective administer high dos activate DLI repeat dos activate DLI . - Patients remission 3 month receive initial activate DLI treat activated donor lymphocytes every 3 month total 4 time ( 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month first infusion ) test safe give repeat dos activate DLI see repeat dos prevent subsequent relapse . - For patient remission 6-12 week initial activate DLI , test whether safe effective give high dos activate donor lymphocyte . Using experimental procedure activate donor lymphocyte , lymphocytes also grown laboratory 10 time lymphocytes give obtain use conventional DLI . For study , similar previous study aDLI , patient receive standard donor lymphocyte infusion first , addition receive activate donor lymphocyte approximately 12 day later ( DLI follow aDLI ) . Depending response treatment , depend possible side effect ( graft-vs-host disease describe ) , patient remission receive additional aDLI every 3 month 4 time , patient remission within 6-12 week receive high dose aDLI . The timing high dose aDLI determine physician depend disease rate progression disease . The aDLI give early 6 week , late 12 week ( 3 month ) . In previous study high dose aDLI patient receive dose initially administer study 1 x 108 CD3+ cells/kg . However , research study also include dos higher use previous study . Patients remission receive dose 1 x 108 CD3+ cells/kg 4 additional occasion long unacceptable side effect observe . Patients remission receive dose 10 time higher .</detailed_description>
