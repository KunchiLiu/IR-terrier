	<brief_title>INCB018424 Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Ruxolitinib design block protein product mutate ( change ) gene may important cancer cell growth survival . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , every day 28-day cycle take ruxolitinib mouth 2 time day ( morning evening ) . On Day 1 cycle , morning dose study drug take visit clinic unless doctor say differently . If doctor think necessary , dose study drug may raise lower . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You ask list drug may take experienced side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 ( +/- 2 day ) , follow test procedure perform ( do local physician 's office ) : - Your medical history review , include drug may take . - You ask experienced side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2-4 ( +/- 2 day ) every 3 month , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history review , include drug may take . - You ask experienced side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think necessary , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check status disease . - If doctor think necessary , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - During visit , also receive new supply medication . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 2 3 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test local doctor 's office . On Day 1 Cycles 4 , 7 , every 6th cycle ( Cycles 13 , 19 , 25 , ) , bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease . On Day 1 Cycle 4 , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy also look gene chromosome leukemia cell . If enough information biopsy/aspirate , leftover blood use look gene chromosome information . Every 2 week Cycles 4-7 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . You call month study . During phone call ask , experienced side effect , take study drug correct dose time . This phone call take minute . You send card mail remind study visit need complete . Women able become pregnant urine pregnancy test suspicion pregnancy . If test positive , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Length Study : You may stay study long benefitting . You take study experience intolerable side effect disease get bad . End-of-Study Visit : After go study end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history review , include drug may take . - You ask experienced side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think necessary , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check status disease . - If doctor think necessary , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . - Women able become pregnant urine pregnancy test . If test positive , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . This investigational study . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treat myelofibrosis . Giving ruxolitinib patient advance hematological malignancy investigational . Up 120 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Must least 18 year age . 2 . Patients must relapsed/refractory leukemias standard therapy exist . Patients poorrisk myelodysplasia ( MDS ) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) fail prior therapy also candidate protocol . Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( AML ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification ( i.e . &gt; /= 20 % blast ) , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) blast crisis . Patients CML resistant least two tyrosine kinase inhibitor standard stem cell transplant option also eligible . 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 4 . A female childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test screening . Women childbearing potential must use acceptable contraceptive method , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior begin treatment trial . Nursing patient exclude . Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study . 5 . Must able willing give write informed consent . 6 . In absence rapidly progress disease , interval prior treatment time study drug administration least 2 week cytotoxic agent , least one week noncytotoxic agent . Persistent clinically significant toxicity prior chemotherapy must great grade 2 . 7 . Patients must follow clinical laboratory value unless consider due leukemic organ involvement : 1 . ) Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dl . 2 . ) Total bilirubin less equal 1.5x upper limit normal unless consider due Gilbert 's syndrome hemolysis . 3 . ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 2.5x upper limit normal unless consider due organ leukemic involvement ( 5x ) . 8 . Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) disease include treat concurrently intrathecal therapy . INCB018424 administer intrathecal route . 1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 2 . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 3 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , arrhythmias control medication , uncontrolled congestive heart failure . 3 . Current treatment treatment within 2 week 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication another investigational medication current enrollment another investigational drug protocol ( unless evidence rapidly progressive disease case short interval last therapy may acceptable ) . 4 . Females pregnant currently breastfeed . 5 . Patients receive therapy intermediate high dose steroid great equivalent 10 mg prednisone per day allow . 6 . Evidence active hepatitis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection determine screen laboratory test result result within prior 3 month . 7 . Any unresolved toxicity equal great Grade 2 previous anticancer therapy , except stable chronic toxicity expect resolve , peripheral neurotoxicity . 8 . Incomplete recovery prior surgical procedure surgery within 4 week prior study entry , exclude placement vascular access . 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness concurrent condition , Investigator 's opinion , would jeopardize safety patient compliance protocol . 10 . In patient receive medication know inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 every effort make change medication acceptable alternative . If safely possible , patient exclude participation study . If patient already study , must start CYP3A4 inhibitor , demonstrate benefit study , see twice weekly first cycle weekly subsequent cycle toxicity evaluation dose modify event toxicity relate study drug .</criteria>
