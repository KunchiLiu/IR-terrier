	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give everolimus together trastuzumab effective give trastuzumab alone treat woman breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study trastuzumab everolimus see well work compare trastuzumab alone surgery treat patient breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab With Without Everolimus Treating Women With Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate added efficacy obtain association trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) everolimus preoperative therapy primary HER2-positive breast cancer show increase clinical tumor response rate . Secondary - To compare inhibition two pathway , RAS/RAF/MAP kinase PI3-kinase/AKT/mTor . - To evaluate whether pre-treatment molecular characteristic tumor serum modification early treatment predictive clinical response . - To compare frequency pathological complete response achieve two group 6 week treatment . - To determine disease-free survival 3 year . - To evaluate safety tolerability two treatment regimen . - To analyze possible relationship treatment toxicity constitutional gene polymorphism link administered agent . - To analyze possible relationship response molecular pharmacodynamic assessment , include proteomics ( blood sample ) , Bio-Plex protein array ( tumor ) , IHC ( tumor ) . - To analyze drug level pharmacokinetic assessment everolimus trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV weekly 6 week . Patients undergo surgery . - Arm II : Patients receive trastuzumab arm I oral everolimus daily 6 week . Within 24 hour complete everolimus , patient undergo surgery . Blood tumor sample collect periodically study pharmacogenomic , proteomic , pharmacokinetic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
