	<detailed_description>This study involve secondary data analysis study do Wylie-Rosett et al . 2001 . Using 3-arm , 12-month randomized clinical trial , Wylie-Rosett et al . evaluate cost effect incremental component weight-loss program . The study include 588 individual ( BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 ) freestanding health maintenance organization achieve 81 % completion rate . The intervention use cognitive behavioral approach tailor lifestyle modification goal . The incremental level intervention include ) workbook alone , b ) addition computerize tailor use onsite computer kiosk touch screen monitor , c ) addition computer staff consultation . For increase level intervention intensity , mean 12-month weight loss 2.2 , 4.7 , 7.4 pound , respective cost per participant $ 12.33 , $ 41.99 , $ 133.74 . The decrease mean BMIs respective intervention level 0.4 , 0.9 , 1.2 . All group report decrease energy fat intake increase block walk ( p &lt; .01 ) . Intervention variable correlate weight loss include computer logons , achieve computer-selected goal , self-monitoring , increased walking , decrease energy fat intake , well high attendance staff consultation group session treatment condition . Weight loss correlate decrease fast glucose blood pressure . Wylie-Rosett et al . ( 2001 ) conclude , weight-loss program , computer facilitate selecting behavioral change goal . More frequent usage result great weight loss , staff counsel augment computer intervention achieve weight loss . The purpose study secondary analysis data collect original MODELS study .</detailed_description>
