	<brief_summary>The objective study obtain preliminary open-label data efficacy tolerability memantine , anti-glutamatergic medication unique pharmacodynamic profile , individual OCD individual GAD . Because glutamatergic hyperactivity frontal frontal-subcortical circuit may play role symptomatic expression OCD , possibly GAD , agent reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission provide unique anti-stress anti-obsessional benefit . Memantine specific , uncompetitive antagonist NMDA receptor block sustain activation NMDA receptor high concentration glutamate pathological condition rapidly leave NMDA channel upon transient physiological activation low concentration glutamate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several case report open-label trial report efficacy anti-glutamatergic medication treatment OCD . In open-label trial riluzole , glutamate release inhibitor , seven 13 adult patient OCD improve , five categorize treatment responder . Another open trial find riluzole effective four six child treatment-refractory OCD . N-acetylcysteine , agent likely attenuate glutamate neurotransmission , effective augmentation one patient OCD . Two case report describe memantine treatment OCD . Poyurovsky et al . report improvement memantine augmentation one patient treatment resistant OCD , Pasquini Biondi note improvement one OCD patient check compulsion one contamination obsession . There control open-label trial memantine OCD report thus far . Few study examine efficacy anti-glutamatergic agent GAD . In open-label trial riluzole treatment 18 patient GAD , twelve patient respond eight achieve remission . A double-blind , control study find LY354740 , metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 ( mGlu2/3 ) agonist , significantly effective placebo GAD . No study memantine GAD report thus far . We hypothesize treatment memantine would result significant symptom reduction OCD GAD .</detailed_description>

Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior receive study drug . Written informed consent must obtain subject prior study participation . The subject good medical health chronic medical condition currently stable . No current abuse alcohol substance . The subject total score 20 HARS YBOCS screening ( GAD OCD , respectively ) The subject Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) Severity score 4 screening . The subject meet DSMIV criterion Axis I diagnosis ( GAD OCD ) primary diagnosis ( i.e. , schizophrenia , mood disorder , psychosis , anorexia nervosa ) determine MINI . The subject clinically judge investigator risk suicide acutely suicidal objectively measure MINI MSE . The subject clinically judge investigator risk homicide acutely homicidal objectively measure MINI MSE . The subject psychiatric condition would require inpatient , partial psychiatric hospitalization . Seizure disorder . Significant history medical disease ( i.e . cardiovascular , hepatic ( e.g . cirrhosis , hepatitis B C ) renal , gynecological , musculoskeletal , neurological , gastrointestinal , metabolic , hematological , endocrine , cancer metastatic potential progressive neurological disorder ) could impair reliable participation trial necessitate use medication allow protocol . The subject pregnant , plan become pregnant , nursing . If subject becomes pregnant , discontinue immediately follow appropriately . Concomitant therapy another investigational drug , participation investigational drug study within one month prior enter study . Current psychotherapeutic treatment except treatment Specific Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRIs ) medication include : Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , Paroxetine ( Paxil ) , Sertraline ( Zoloft ) , Luvox ( Fluvoxamine ) , Citalopram . Potential subject may remain one SSRI medication provide stable dose least 4 week prior enter study ; dose remain stable throughout remainder study ; determine medication exacerbate anxiety symptom . History poor compliance Investigator 's judgment patient subject whose treatment outpatient would clinically contraindicate The subject attempt suicide one time within past twelve month The subject Structured Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( SIGHD ) score 38 suggests moderate severe clinical level depressive symptom</criteria>
