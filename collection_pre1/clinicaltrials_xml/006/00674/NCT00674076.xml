	<detailed_description>Patients obstructive sleep apnea mainly due upper airway narrow evaluate conventionaly polysomography . Recently , magnetic resonace image well establish evaluate upper airway correlate severity tongue mass area retropalatal airway . However , drawback MRI include expensiveness might lead less use . As ultrasound popularly apply medical illness , convenient money save MRI . We propose ultrsound measure tongue volume width upper airway submental area may alternative image upper airway measure .</detailed_description>
