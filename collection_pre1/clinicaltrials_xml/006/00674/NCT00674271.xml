	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate relation individual difference pattern recognition molecule ( PRM 's ) innate immune system prevalence development vascular complication patient type 2 diabetes . This base hypothesis pattern recognition molecule ( PRM 's ) innate immune system contribute chronic low grade inflammation diabetic patient . Variation PRM 's - genome , proteome well functional level - therefore associate degree chronic low grade inflammation , probably also prevalence vascular complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : The primary aim project : 1 . By use advance magnetic resonance image characterize prevalence atherosclerosis carotid arteries patient newly diagnose type 2 diabetes . 2 . To investigate individual difference innate immune system contribute prevalence development cardiovascular disease patient type 2 diabetes . 3 . To prospectively observe cardiovascular morbidity mortality cohort patient type 2 diabetes see light obtain baseline characteristic . Background : Type 2 diabetes common disease western world . Patients type 2 diabetes risk number complication , include macroangiopathy involves accelerate atherosclerosis , cause increased mortality morbidity type 2 diabetic . Mounting evidence suggest development vascular complication associate chronic low grad inflammation type 2 diabetes . Individual difference innate immune system might contribute chronic low grade inflammation become apparent situation - tissue ischemia diabetes - change body 's cell glycosylations occur , lead increase affinity PRM 's . This study focus primarily two family PRM 's : Collectins Toll-like receptor . Methods : The study consist prospective observational cohort study 100 newly diagnose type 2 diabetic patient continuous 2-year clinical follow-up register-based follow-up morbidity mortality study 5 10 year . Furthermore 100 healthy control subject include . Baseline data represent independent cross-sectional study relationship innate immune system , glycemic control presence atherosclerosis carotid artery newly diagnose type 2 diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
