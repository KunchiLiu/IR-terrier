	<brief_summary>Lateral epicondylitis ( LE ) , tennis elbow , common often disable condition affect young middle-aged adults-most commonly manual worker recreational athlete . It result significant pain disability , limit work productivity individual 's ability participate enjoy recreational activity . Like many chronic musculoskeletal condition LE often show incomplete response acute treatment , lead chronic pain disability . Prolotherapy ( PrT ) involve injection irritant proliferant solution tendon , ligament , joint treat chronic musculoskeletal pain . We conduct 3-group randomize , blind trial determine safety efficacy PrT injection treatment chronic LE . Additionally , seek determine extent beneficial effect PrT derive deep needle placement vs. specific effect injectate . The specific aim study : 1 ) determine PrT safe , well-tolerated , effective treatment individual chronic LE ; 2 ) determine whether deep needle placement alone responsible therapeutic effect , independent injectate . In order accomplish aim , measure indicator pain disability use self-rating scale , questionnaire physical measure . Subjects stratify prior randomization two factor : 1 ) unilateral vs. bilateral LE ; 2 ) treatment steroid within prior 6 month . If effective , subject receive PrT show great reduction pain functional impairment compare two group . This research guide future study prolotherapy determine may best control condition . Additionally , study may explore mechanism responsible beneficial effect .</brief_summary>

Known allergy lidocaine dextrose ; 4 . Presence autoimmune condition rheumatoid arthritis , give possible immune mechanism hypothesize PrT . 5 . Presence know immune dysfunction , HIV/AIDS , might raise risk development infection injection ; 6 . Ongoing treatment systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressant medication , may block potential immune mechanism PrT increase risk infection ; 7 . Active diagnosis malignancy anywhere body , give potential concurrent immune dysfunction impact response PrT ; 8 . Treatment anticoagulant medication beyond 1 aspirin per day , give potential increase bleed bruise associated injection ; 9 . Presence coagulopathy , give potential increase bleed bruise associated injection ; 10 . Pregnancyâ€”as research document safety PrT pregnancy ; 11 . Medical necessity take ongoing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication , beyond 1 aspirin per day cardiac prevention , may diminish effect PrT ; 12 . Corticosteroid injection within 6 week prior entry study , may diminish effect PrT . 13 . Prior treatment PrT condition , may impact blinding .</criteria>
