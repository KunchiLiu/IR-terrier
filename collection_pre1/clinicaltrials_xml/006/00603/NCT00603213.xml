	<brief_title>Correlation Intrathoracic Impedance Measures With Blood Plasma Volume Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) affect 5 million people United States , additional 550,000 case diagnosed year . Despite major recent stride treatment , diagnosis CHF still carry significant annual morbidity mortality . The resultant economic burden associate management disease estimate $ 40 billion per year , 60 % - 75 % result inpatient management ( 1 ) . Emergency room visit , frequent outpatient encounter hemodynamic monitor intensive care associate inpatient management contribute significantly total cost . Current outpatient heart failure management program focus lifestyle change , pharmacotherapy , disease awareness , emphasize self identification sign symptom volume overload . Despite best effort involve , frequent unscheduled visit outpatient clinic emergency department remain common , even patient participate formal management program . Accurate identification elevate filling pressure intravascular volume prior significant worsening symptom remain elusive goal management . Although elevated jugular venous pressure presence third heart sound show prognostic value patient heart failure ( 2 ) , physical exam finding elevate fill pressure reliably correlate invasive hemodynamics ( 3 ) . Invasive measurement filling pressure cardiac output pulmonary artery catheter gold standard hemodynamic assessment decade . However , method carry significant inherent risk placement maintenance well-suited frequent assessment outpatient set . Development method would accurately reliably identify hypervolemia elevate filling pressure prior onset symptom may allow early intervention significant impact quality life , morbidity , mortality patient CHF . Blood volume analysis use 100 year assessment plasma volume red cell mass . Earlier technique rely dilution various dye base concept concentration know quantity dye inversely proportional volume blood inject . Later , use concept , 51Cr label red blood cell 125I labeled albumen , develop measure red cell plasma compartment respectively . Although dual isotope method consider gold standard , cumbersome require least 6 hour completion . A new , highly automate method use 131I labeled albumen serial hematocrit measurement ( BVA-100 , Daxor Corp. New York , NY ) show correlate well dual isotope method require 1 ½ hour completion ( Dworkin et al , unpublished data ) . Additionally , method automatically compare measure blood , plasma red cell volume norm base sex , weight height patient manner Feldschuh Enson ( 4 ) . Using method , Androne et al ( 5 ) find 65 % nonedematous CHF patient unrecognized hypervolemia . More recently , anemia show poor prognostic marker CHF . In separate report , Androne et al ( 6 ) find 46 % anemic CHF patient dilutional anemia vs. 54 % true anemia . The success target therapy may depend determine whether anemia dilutional due reduce red cell mass . Despite method 's accuracy , practical serial measurement require proactively intervene CHF population . Transthoracic impedance cardiography ( ICG ) rely change transthoracic electrical impedance alternate current apply across thorax . Derived measure include stroke volume , cardiac output thoracic fluid content . Although early study validate use method assessment intrathoracic volume ( 7 ) , conflict result regard correlation cardiac output ( CO ) derive transthoracic ICG obtain traditional method thermodilution , indicator dye-dilution Fick method ( 8 ) . In addition , cumbersome nature serial data acquisition realization derive hemodynamic data may affect lead placement make method less attractive ambulatory setting . Intrathoracic impedance similar transthoracic ICG rely change impedance surrogate marker volume status . The technique measure impedance right ventricular lead pacing/defibrillator case . The technique subject operator dependent variability ICG well suit serial measurement outpatient setting . The Optivol® system develop Medtronic ( Minneapolis , MN ) employ proprietary software ( TFS ) collect averages impedance value specific time period day produce Daily Impedance Value . The TFS software derive store Daily Mean Impedance , Reference Impedance , Cumulative Difference Daily Impedance Value . The use predetermine threshold Cumulative Difference Daily Impedance Value provide early warning increase thoracic fluid . This data accessible health care practitioner periodic download clinic via interrogation Medtronic 's web-based CareLink system . Abraham et al ( 9 ) demonstrate TFS trend consistent clinical fluid status small group patient . In addition , recent study Yu et al ( 10 ) find intrathoracic impedance inversely related pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , begin decrease day onset symptom CHF . While data derive Optivol® system appear mirror intrathoracic fluid content , useful determine trend , certain shortcoming remain . First , though change intrathoracic impedance may inversely mirror change thoracic fluid content , system provide absolute reference standard determine euvolemia individual patient . Secondly , unclear whether certain concomitant condition ( anemia , COPD ) affect relationship .</detailed_description>
