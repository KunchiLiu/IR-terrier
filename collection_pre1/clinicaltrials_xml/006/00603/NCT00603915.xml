	<brief_summary>Cisplatin Carboplatin give day 1 every 21 day 6 cycle ; Gemcitabine give day 1 day 8 every 21 day 6 cycle . Those patient progress GC 6 cycle chemotherapy start erlotinib daily disease progression . A cycle erlotinib 28 day . Patients progress GC offer erlotinib well , order evaluate activity single-agent second-line setting . Patients previously treat GC report progression-free survival ( PFS ) 9 month . We would anticipate extension PFS 12 month patient treat GC follow maintenance erlotinib . Furthermore , hypothesize patient achieve benefit GC therapy would response treat maintenance erlotinib , strategy may increase likelihood attain long-term survival .</brief_summary>
