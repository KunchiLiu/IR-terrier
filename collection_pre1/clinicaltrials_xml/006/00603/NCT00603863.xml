	<detailed_description>Patients receive 4-week treatment cycle once-weekly 30-minute gemcitabine infusion begin one week prior first 90Y-hPAM4dose continue 3 consecutive week weekly 90Y-hPAM4 dos give . Depending toxicity , patient cohort receive one several possible 90Y gemcitabine dose combination . Post-treatment evaluation conduct institute another 90YhPAM4 treatment cycle , maintenance gemcitabine maximum period 12 week .</detailed_description>

Stage III ( locally advance , unresectable ) Stage IV ( metastatic ) disease , include patient underwent surgery incomplete resection . Treatment naïve ( prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy investigational agent pancreatic cancer ) Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % ( Appendix A ) . Expected survival &gt; 3 month . At least 4 week beyond major surgery recover acute toxicity At least 2 week beyond corticosteroid , except low dos ( i.e. , 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) treat nausea illness rheumatoid arthritis Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support ( hemoglobin &gt; 11 g/dL , ANC &gt; 2,000 per mm3 , platelet &gt; 150,000 per mm3 ) Adequate renal hepatic function ( creatinine bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X IULN , AST ALT ≤ 2.0 X IULN ) Otherwise , toxicity study entry &lt; Grade 1 NCI CTC v3.0 . Women pregnant lactating . Women childbearing potential fertile men unwilling use effective contraception study conclusion 12week posttreatment evaluation period . Known metastatic disease central nervous system . Presence bulky disease ( define single mass &gt; 10 cm great dimension ) Patients &gt; Grade 2 anorexia , nausea vomiting , and/or sign intestinal obstruction . Prior radiation dose &gt; 3,000 cGy liver , &gt; 2,000 cGy lung kidneys prior external beam irradiation field include 30 % red marrow . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix exclude , patient prior malignancy must least 5year disease free interval . Patients know HIV positive , hepatitis B positive , hepatitis C positive . Known history active coronary artery disease , unstable angina , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure present within 6 month cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmia therapy . Known history active COPD , moderatetosevere respiratory illness present within 6 month . Known autoimmune disease presence autoimmune phenomenon ( except rheumatoid arthritis require low dose maintenance corticosteroid ) . Infection require intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week . Other concurrent medical psychiatric condition , Investigator 's opinion , may likely confound study interpretation prevent completion study procedure followup examination .</criteria>
