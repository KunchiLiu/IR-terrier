	<brief_summary>The hypothesis postmenopausal woman receive chemotherapy great bone loss age control . The aim study obtain baseline bone mineral density ( BMD ) data woman breast gynecological cancer receive chemotherapy . By compare Z score postmenopausal woman receive chemotherapy age match control hypothesis evaluate . Another goal study compare T-score Heel Bone Density Scan T-score DXA Scan see good correlation peripheral DXA score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Bone Mineral Density Women Who Have Received Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It generally accept woman develop breast cancer increase bone mineral density ( BMD ) probably due endogenous estrogen production . After menopause , BMD decrease rather rapidly particularly first year natural menopause . Bone loss typically rapid severe premature induce menopause ( surgical , chemotherapeutically , hormonal ) . The bone loss appear rapid early age advance bone age great degree actual age . Chemotherapeutically-induced menopause accelerate process average 10 year . GnRH agonist premenopausal woman cause amenorrhea &gt; 95 % associate loss cortical trabecular bone . In woman undergo ovarian ablation therapy , loss bone mass high 13 % report first year treatment . Premenopausal woman treatment become amenorrheic remain amenorrheic posttreatment vast majority case . Adjuvant therapy cancer exaggerate bone mineral density loss . Chemotherapy may effect estrogen level may also effect bone loss via direct cytotoxic effect bone cell . Although data concern BMD patient receive chemotherapy child men prostate cancer , little data concern BMD gynecologic oncology patient receive chemotherapy . Several different chemotherapeutic agent incriminated effect bone mineral density . The alkylating drug , particularly Cytoxan , show decrease bone mineral density . Methotrexate recently taxanes appear effect . Since chemotherapy today give combination , one cytoxic agent bone include therefore study evaluate postmenopausal woman receive chemotherapy . Data collection : Women participate study undergo two scan : Heel Scan measure bone mineral density heel area DXA scan measure bone mineral density lumbar region spine hip . Both scan provide T-score Z-score subject .</detailed_description>
