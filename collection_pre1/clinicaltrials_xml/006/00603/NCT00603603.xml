	<brief_summary>Previous study demonstrate patient undergo surgery general anesthesia few wound infection receive high concentration oxygen never study woman undergo cesarean section . We plan randomize woman undergo cesarean receive either standard care oxygen flow nasal cannula cesarean section high concentration oxygen would typically receive face mask . Women receive therapy cesarean 2 hour afterwards . We follow surgery evidence infection either wound uterus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Clinical Trial Supplemental Oxygen Prevention Post-Cesarean Infectious Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We design randomize control trial supplemental oxygen prevention post cesarean delivery infectious morbidity Washington University St. Louis , MO . Patients underwent schedule intrapartum cesarean delivery regional anesthesia eligible participation . Women recruit study participation antepartum service labor delivery . Exclusion criterion include emergency surgery participant unable provide inform consent , human immunodeficiency virus infection , chronic corticosteroid therapy immunosuppressive therapy , general anesthesia , diagnosis extra uterine infection ( i.e. , pyelonephritis pneumonia ) cesarean delivery . Acute chorioamnionitis exclusion criterion . After write consent obtain , patient randomly assign 1:1 scheme receive either supplemental oxygen standard care . Randomization achieve opaque envelope contain assigned study group ; envelope open patient agree participate study surgery . Women supplemental oxygen group receive oxygen flow rate 10 L/min ( correspond FiO2 approximately 80 % ) nonrebreather mask ( CareFusion , Yorba Linda , CA ) 2 hour cesarean delivery . Compliance supplemental oxygen face mask assess anesthesiologist intraoperatively postpartum nurse 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minute surgery . Women assign standard care group receive oxygen flow rate 2 L/min ( correspond FiO2 25-30 % ) nasal cannula ( Salter Labs , Arvin , CA ) cesarean delivery . Oxygen saturation assess intraoperatively postoperatively group ; woman oxygen saturation 95 % supplied supplemental oxygen , need , maintain appropriate oxygenation . Women group receive standard preoperative skin preparation prophylactic antibiotic . Subcutaneous depth measure primary operative team sterile ruler ; demographic , intrapartum , operative information abstract medical record . The operative decision place subcutaneous suture leave surgical team . The primary outcome study composite outcome consist endometritis wound infection . Strict diagnostic criterion use infectious outcome . A patient diagnose endometritis oral temperature 38°C first 24 hour follow procedure either ( 1 ) fundal lower abdominal tenderness great expect ( 2 ) foul-smelling purulent lochia.16 Endometritis diagnose cause patient 's sign symptom identify . Patients treat intravenous antibiotic diagnosis endometritis meet study definition . The diagnosis wound infection require wound open &gt; 1 cm surgical intervention ( laparotomy debridement tissue ) plus least 1 follow : ( 1 ) purulent drainage wound , ( 2 ) erythema induration surround tissue , ( 3 ) maternal oral temperature &gt; 38°C , ( 4 ) radiographic evidence infection . Secondary outcome define study initiate include need wound open &gt; 1 cm wound hematoma seroma , hospital readmission , need intravenous antibiotic first 24 hour procedure . We also collect data immediate neonatal outcome include Apgar score , special care nursery neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) admission , umbilical artery pH , O2 , CO2 , antibiotic administration birth . Physicians provide educational material regard diagnosis endometritis wound infection study initiation intermittently throughout study period . All outcome assess primary care team , diagnosis abstract chart study personnel ( research nurse investigator ) . The medical record review time 2-4 week postoperative visit , woman return postoperative visit within 4 week plan follow-up visit outside clinic contact research nurse telephone inquire postoperative complication . The data collection form use prompt telephone interview ensure standardization . The primary comparison study supplemental oxygen v standard care respect primary outcome infectious morbidity . Data analyze intent-to-treat principle , separate analysis complete analyzed patient treat accord protocol . Analysis include unpaired test normally distribute continuous variable , Mann-Whitney U test nonnormally distribute continuous variable , chi-squared Fisher 's exact test categorical data . Stratified analyse Mantel-Haenszel test logistic regression perform assess confound interaction . Risk ratios 95 % confidence interval calculate outcomes treatment arm . A probability value &lt; .05 consider significant . No interim analysis plan conduct . The study protocol include continuous ( daily ) process monitor report maternal neonatal adverse event research team . Adverse event report Human Research Protection Office institutional review board occur . For initial sample size calculation , estimate rate infectious morbidity , consist endometritis wound infection , 15 % . To detect 50 % reduction surgical site infection 80 % power alpha error 0.05 , 278 woman per arm require . After 50 % subject enrol , calculated sample size 556 woman increase approximately 10 % account observed loss follow-up rate , result final sample size 606 woman .</detailed_description>
