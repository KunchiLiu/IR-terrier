	<brief_summary>Successful treatment non-small cell lung cancer radiation therapy require physician determine exactly tumor body protect normal tissue . This study design apply functional imaging , Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) Ventilation/Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography ( V/Q SPECT ) , treatment treatment see help predict well treatment work cancer well lung function treatment . A Computerized Tomography ( CT ) also perform along procedure help researcher see clearly cancer healthy lung locate . The researcher also blood test study look marker blood see help determine risk develop side effect radiation lung . The researcher hope study help future design radiation treatment plan provide best treatment individual patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States , 80 % lung cancer ( NSCLC , include squamous cell lung cancer , small cell lung cancer ) . Although surgery provide best chance cure , majority lung cancer require radiation treatment . The current radiation recommendation , use modern technique uniform radiation dose , generate overall cure rate less 10-15 % , moderate toxicity 10-30 % treated patient . Who cure develop side effect ? Computed tomography ( CT ) provide useful tool monitor , limited power predict tumor control lung toxicity . Using [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) ventilation/perfusion single photon emission compute tomography ( V/Q SPECT ) , recently show change tumor activity regional lung function course radiation , may associate long-term outcome . The general strategy project perform functional image blood test course radiation correlate long-term outcome . By complete study , expect generate predictive model well CT-based one tumor control lung toxicity .</detailed_description>
