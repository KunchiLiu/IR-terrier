Investigational Medications : A subject must participate study use investigational drug within 30 day prior Visit 1 . Drug Allergy : Any adverse reaction include immediate delay hypersensitivity beta2agonist , sympathomimetic drug , intranasal , inhale , systemic corticosteroid therapy . Known suspected sensitivity constituent novel dry powder inhaler DISKUS/ACCUHALER ( i.e. , lactose magnesium stearate ) . Milk Protein Allergy : History severe milk protein allergy . Immunosuppressive Medications : A subject must use , require use , immunosuppressive medication study . NOTE : Immunotherapy treatment allergy allow study provide treatment initiated prior Visit 1 subject maintain stable regimen throughout study period . Attendance : A subject eligible he/she his/her parent legal guardian infirmity , disability , geographical location seem likely ( opinion Investigator ) impair compliance aspect study protocol schedule visit study center noncompliant study medication procedure ( e.g . completion daily diary ) . Neurological psychiatric disease history drug alcohol abuse opinion investigator could interfere subject 's proper completion protocol requirement exclude study participation . Tobacco Use : Current smoker smoke history 10 pack year ( e.g . 20 cigarettes/day 10 year ) . A subject may use tobacco product within past one year ( i.e. , cigarette , cigar , pipe tobacco ) . Affiliation Investigator 's Site : A subject eligible study he/she immediate family member participate Investigator , sub‑Investigator , study coordinator , employee participate Investigator .

Exclusion Criteria Randomization At end runin period , subject eligible enter treatment period study meet follow criterion . 1 . Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities : Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test Visit 1 still abnormal upon repeat analysis believe due disease ( ) present . Each Investigator use his/her discretion determine clinical significance abnormality . When doubt , GlaxoSmithKline , designee , notify joint decision make . 2 . Changes asthma medication ( exclude albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol provide Visit 1 ) . 3 . Occurrence culturedocumented suspected bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus middle ear runin period lead change asthma management , opinion Investigator expect affect subject 's asthma status subject 's ability participate study . 4 . Asthma exacerbation , define worsen asthma require treatment rescue albuterol/salbutamol regular inhaled corticosteroid use . This include require use systemic corticosteroid / emergency room visit hospitalization change subject 's regular inhale corticosteroid dose . 5 . A subject eligible randomization he/she abnormal visual oropharyngeal exam randomization Visit 3 ( visual clinical evidence oral candidiasis ) . 6 . Noncompliance completion Daily Diary , define : Completion AM PM symptom score less 4 day last 7 day immediately precede Visit 3 . Completion AM PM rescue use le 4 day last 7 day immediately precede Visit 3 . Completion AM PM PEF measurement less 4 day last 7 day immediately precede Visit 3 . Recording runin asthma medication use le 4 day last 7 day immediately precede Visit 3 .</criteria>
