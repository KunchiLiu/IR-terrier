	<brief_summary>Status epilepticus ( SE ) represent common life-threatening neurological emergency require treatment intensive care unit . The incidence Western European country 12-18/100'000 . Immediate effective treatment SE obviously essential deleterious effect continuous seizure brain whole organism . Guidelines emphasize use benzodiazepine ( BZD ) first-line anticonvulsive drug . Alternatively , i/v Phenytoin ( PHE ) , fosphenytoin ( FOS ) , valproate ( VPA ) also test first-line anticonvulsant SE . Direct comparison PHE lorazepam ( LZP ) show significant superiority LZP ( evidence class I ) . Other trial i/v PHE -VPA evidence class III IV . BZD , VPA , PHE clinical pharmacological disadvantage . BZD may cause respiratory depression sedation may suitable patient COPD ambiguous patient BZD addiction . Some compound also may induce tachyphylaxis accumulate concomitant renal failure . PHE saturable metabolism subject Michaelis-Menten kinetics increase risk overdose acute set cause liver damage , serious cardiac arrhythmia , hypotension , cerebellar degeneration , peripheral neuropathy local/systemic skin reaction . Although unequivocal efficacy , PHE longer use long-term adverse effect chronic administration ( irreversible cerebellar degeneration cause debilitate ataxia , painful polyneuropathy , osteopenia increase risk fracture ) . Metabolism self-induction hepatic CYP450 system make PHE prone interaction several drug , notably antiepileptic . VPA may cause liver failure , hemorrhagic complication , pancreatitis , hyperammonemic encephalopathy . To summarize , three first-line agent treatment SE may cause serious side effect several patient SE . Levetiracetam ( LEV ) broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug . It bind presynaptic vesicular protein 2A abundantly present different region brain ; LEV presynaptically modulate transmitter release , exact mechanism ( ) remain unclear . Data also reveal LEV stabilize GABAA receptor upon repetitive activation important treatment SE GABAA receptor undergo significant change subunit conformation within minute sustain activation like SE . These change render GABAA receptor less anticonvulsive , longer SE last . Levetiracetam favorable pharmacological profile large safety margin . Its partly extrahepatic hydrolyzation bypass CYP450 system ; renal excretion 60-70 % unchanged , 23-27 % metabolize . Dosage need adjustment renal function impair . LEV lack interaction drug yet . Drowsiness common side-effect respiration , liver kidney function , blood system affect . LEV show important clinical effect even first dose maximal efficacy within first week drug-intake . The favorable clinico-pharmacological profile predilects LEV first-line treatment SE , especially patient multi-organ failure , sepsis , coma etc.. About 10 % comatous patient may non-convulsive SE ( NCSE ) ICU 's . These patient polymedication whereby interaction anticonvulsant approve yet treatment NCSE drug may fatal effect . Conversely , non-interacting anticonvulsant would represent advantage treatment NCSE patient . Recently , i/v formulation LEV approve FDA use patient , specifically treatment SE . Data single-dose bioavailability i/v-LEV comparison oral tablet well multiple-dose pharmacokinetics tolerability healthy subject recently publish . In addition , administration i/v-LEV dosage range 2000-4000 mg within 15 minute dosage range 1500-2500 mg within 5 minute safe well tolerate , lead efficacious drug level randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled safety pharmacokinetic study healthy volunteer . Slight somnolence expect adverse effect i/v LEV , sharply contrast sedation coma i/v benzodiazepine . Thus , even severely ill patient accessible neurological test LEV big advantage clinical difficult set NCSE . I-v LEV consider ideal candidate first-line use ( benzodiazepine ) patient NCSE , especially important comorbidity concomitant polymedication . Thus , would like test feasibility , safety , efficacy i/v-LEV first-line medication open-label , single-center , prospective pilot study outline .</brief_summary>
