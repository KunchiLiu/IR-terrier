	<brief_title>Induction Clinical Response Using Rifaximin Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) debilitate chronic inflammatory disease conventionally categorize Crohn 's disease ( CD ) Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) . CD affect nearly 630,000 people North America 50,000 new people diagnose every year . It chronic debilitate disease characterize abdominal pain , malnutrition , bloody diarrhea , fistula formation , intestinal perforation stricture , even extra-intestinal manifestation joint pain skin rash . Nearly 80 % people CD need surgical treatment point disease process . The majority CD subject diagnose young adulthood thereby subject many decade discomfort medical intervention . Antibiotics use treat CD variable response rate . The basis antibiotic therapy breakdown integrity mucosal barrier gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract lead heighten inflammatory response commensurate luminal bacteria . By change composition bacterial load intestinal lumen , may possible alter immune response . Ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) metronidazole ( Flagyl ) best study antibiotic show efficacy , effect temporal long term use lead serious side effect . Rifaximin recent FDA approve antibiotic broad spectrum activity , excellent safety profile , minimal absorption GI tract . Open label small study IBD subject show response rate 80 % CD subject . These study limit however randomize placebo control trial . The investigator propose conduct randomize placebo control crossover trial rifaximin CD subject assess initial clinical response compare placebo .</detailed_description>
