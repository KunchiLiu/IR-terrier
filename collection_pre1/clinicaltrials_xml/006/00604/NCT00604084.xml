	<detailed_description>Introduction The Secretaría de Estado de Salud Pública Asistencia Social public health clinic Veron , Dominican Republic continually report subjectively high prevalence incidence scabies infection among general patient population without mean direct measurement , proper intervention , control , raise concern long-term infestation may lead multiple secondary medical environmental problem . The purpose project develop community scabies eradication education program highly endemic area surround Veron community . It propose use oral Ivermectin replacement topical Lindane , readily available prescribe pesticide environmental toxin reportedly ban us Dominican Republic well 80 country throughout world ( Boffa , Brough , &amp; Ead , 1995 ; Davies , Dedhia , Mergade , Banquet , &amp; Maibach , 1983 ) . Ivermectin , hand , remarkably safe , effective , cost-comparative oral medication substantially broad scope coverage , duration effectiveness , ease delivery compliance compare Lindane , well 20 year use global mass eradication campaign parasites order 50 million dos date ( Alexander , Bockarie , Kastens , Kazra , &amp; Alpers , 1998 ; del Guidice , Chosidow , &amp; Caumes , 2003 ; Madan , Jaskiran , Gupta , &amp; Gupta , 2001 ) . Specific program goal include : quantification community disease prevalence , statistically significant reduction scabies incidence well secondary disease sequela , improve community scabies awareness prevention ability , decrease environmental impact Veron area eliminate use Lindane scabies treatment . The research design employ door-to-door survey treatment campaign typical Veron neighborhood aim evaluate treat every member target population create mass prophylaxis break parasite-host cycle . Another round treatment occur 6 month later , per pharmacologic dosage interval recommendation ( del Guidice et al. , 2003 ) . Individual group scabies education program occur Veron clinic , well local school target highly susceptible youth population throughout Veron area . Incidence measurement occur monthly basis one year program start , coincide two 6-month treatment interval . At end one year , final scabies prevalence incidence data evaluate statistical significance . While mass treatment cease time , oral Ivermectin become standard care ectoparasite coverage Veron clinic assume statistically significant reduction scabies prevalence achieve . To date , mass scabies eradication program use oral Ivermectin report Caribbean , despite remarkable success country scabies well parasite , namely onchocerciasis filariasis ( Walker &amp; Johnstone , 2000 ; Walton &amp; Holt , 2004 ) . This project potential important contribution effort eradicate source significant morbidity people Veron global community whole . Methodology The Veron Scabies Eradication Education Program obtain priority population data via door-to-door interview within Barrio Nuevo neighborhood . A survey team medical personnel walk door-to-door program attempt survey treat every inhabitant Barrio Nuevo , unless refusal absolute contraindication . Subjects first informed program intent , ask sign letter patient confidentiality , assign number identifier track purpose . After consent obtain , survey administer collect basic demographic information , scabies knowledge indicator , well pertinent past current medical history relate scabies infection contraindication treatment Ivermectin . The subject ask undergo brief skin exam assess scabies infectivity result record use follow criterion : presence erythematous popular , vesicular , pustular , bullous lesion associate itch . Information record use guide treatment protocol . After skin exam , subject instruct scabies medical treatment prevention , give patient information education pamphlet , ask specific question concern , inform ongoing community scabies education workshop clinic , instructed return clinic 2 week active scabies infection . Otherwise , inform researcher return neighborhood month collect information 6 month administer another treatment . Finally , subject give 200μg/kg oral Ivermectin dose height male non-pregnant/non-lactating female , 5 year age old , taller 90 cm . If subject female childbearing age ( still menstruate monthly basis ) , currently menstruate , able show proof use oral contraceptive ( birth control pill ) injectable contraceptive ( schedule Depo Provera ) , surgically sterile ( hysterectomy tubal ligation ) ask undergo rapid urine pregnancy test . If test negative give 200μg/kg oral Ivermectin dose height . If subject knowingly pregnant lactating , rapid pregnancy test positive , child 5 year shorter 90 cm instruct properly use Permethrin 5 % lotion give 60gm bottle . This protocol follow every household visit treat within Barrio Nuevo time = 0 time = 6 month . Investigators conduct monthly scabies incidence survey via door-to-door skin check within Barrio Nuevo look current scabies symptomatology record result form described . At end one year , final scabies prevalence incidence data evaluate statistical significance . While mass treatment cease time , oral Ivermectin become standard care ectoparasite coverage Veron clinic assume statistically significant reduction scabies prevalence achieve .</detailed_description>
