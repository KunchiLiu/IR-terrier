	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) frequent child asthma , induce bronchspasm , increase airway reactivity . Children asthma often treat GER drug supress gastric acid production . However , treatment expensive , unproven benefit . The primary objective study conduct multi-site , randomize , clinical trial test hypothesis treatment GER lansoprazole , approve proton pump inhibitor , decrease frequency exacerbation child poorly control asthma . The study include 300 asthmatic child treat inhaled corticosteroid , 6-16 year age , poor control define frequent symptom , excessive beta agonist use , frequent exacerbation . Participants randomly assign treatment either lansoprazole placebo 6 month . The presence , severity , relationship GER asthma symptom determine 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring , randomization treatment influence presence severity GER . The primary outcome measure proportion participant exacerbation asthma defined diary interview . Secondary outcome measure include asthma symptom control score , GER symptom , lung function , unscheduled health care contact . Pre-defined subgroup analyse examine relationship specific clinical feature response lansoprazole . Treatment response also evaluate 3-hour post-dose plasma lansoprazole concentration , relate polymorphism gene CYP2C19 , cytochrome P450 pathway , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) beta , pro-inflammatory cytokine . Tertiary study determine magnitude GER impact airways inflammation , measure concentration hydrogen ion ( pH ) nitric oxide expire breath . The result trial sould major impact understand treatment GER child asthma .</brief_summary>
