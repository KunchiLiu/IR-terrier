	<detailed_description>Thirty percent return veteran present mental health problem Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) common problem group ( 52 % overall diagnosis ) . This translate PTSD prevalence rate 12 % Afghani veterans 19 % Iraqi veterans , rate two three time higher overall lifetime prevalence rate general population ( 8 % ) . Moreover , 70 % receive mental health service . Thus majority receive help . Those PTSD likely experience problem across several life domain include high rate divorce , problem raise child , engage domestic violence . They also likely suffer mental health problem include depression , substance abuse , generalize anxiety disorder . Forty four percent individual PTSD respond psychosocial pharmacological treatment . Thus , clear need develop highly effective efficient treatment PTSD . Researchers establish relationship PTSD difficulty disengage attention threat relevant information . This knowledge ; however , translate effective treatment disorder . This five-year proposal aim test computerize treatment PTSD double-blind , placebo-controlled study would bridge research attention bias treatment development . Those active condition receive computer-delivered attention modification program ( AMP ) design enhance attention disengagement threaten stimulus . The AMP protocol include six week biweekly session participant see 240 trial consist various combination probe type ( E F ) , probe position ( top bottom ) , word type ( Neutral Trauma ) . Of 240 trial , 48 include neutral word : 2 ( probe type ) X 2 ( probe position ) X 12 ( word pair ) . The remain 192 trial include one neutral word one trauma word : 2 ( probe type ) X 2 ( probe position ) X 2 ( repetition ) X 24 ( word pair ) . On trial participant see one neutral word one trauma word ( i.e. , 80 % trial ) , probe always follow neutral word . Thus , although specific instruction direct attention away threat word , 80 % trial position threat word indicate position probe ( i.e. , location opposite threat word ) . The placebo condition ( PC ) identical AMP condition except presentation threat/neutral word pair , probe appear equal frequency position threat neutral word . Thus , neither threat neutral word signal value . We use intervention successfully establish pattern enhance attention disengagement threat word 3 study . We present result 3 clinical trial demonstrate efficacy attention modification program ( AMP ) ameliorate symptoms anxiety . Specifically , report result study individual generalize social phobia ( GSP ; n=53 ) generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ; n=24 ) demonstrate effectiveness procedure describe proposal . In brief , intervention effective : ) change bias attention , b ) reduce clinical symptom anxiety , c ) maintain effect one year follow-up . This efficient efficacious technique change attention bias anxiety provide low cost , easy administer treatment ground basic cognitive science may help reduce suffer individual anxiety . The goal current proposal extend finding highly related disorder PTSD , examine generalizability result individual comorbid condition . In current proposal test two hypothesis : 1 ) Individuals PTSD complete AMP show large reduction attention bias threat compare placebo group , 2 ) Individuals PTSD complete AMP show large reduction anxiety symptom compare placebo group .</detailed_description>
