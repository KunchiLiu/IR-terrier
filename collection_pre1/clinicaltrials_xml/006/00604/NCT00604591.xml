	<brief_summary>This study test effect medication call tolcapone cognitive , behavioral , language problem see patient frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) . Tolcapone increase amount dopamine , brain chemical may lower FTD . The study see tolcapone improve thinking , behavior , language people FTD look effect drug brain activity . Patients FTD 40 85 year age may eligible study . Participants see outpatient Columbia University Medical Center approximately one week 4 week . They take tolcapone placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) study week 1 . During study week 3 , take placebo week 1 take tolcapone 1 week take tolcapone take placebo . In addition , patient undergo follow test procedure : - Neurological test evaluate attention , problem-solving memory . These test repeat several time course study . - Test look gene affect amount dopamine brain , use blood sample collect previous study . - Blood draw four time study . - Functional MRI ( fMRI ) learn change brain region involve perform task . For fMRI , patient lie table slide scanner , narrow metal cylinder surround magnetic field . The procedure take 60 minute perform four time course . FMRI involve take picture brain MRI subject performs task change brain occur task study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FTD significant cause disability death estimate prevalence 15 case per 100,000 person 45- 64-year-old age range . Despite magnitude problem , currently relative lack understanding cause , treatment , FTD , possibly criterion diagnosis recently develop . As outcome propose investigation , investigator expect determine effect cortical dopamine augmentation FTD , evaluate effect dopamine augmentation processing efficiency fMRI , explore effect genetic polymorphism symptom presentation disease course . The research propose protocol significant could provide new class treatment FTD , identify fMRI finding associate symptom improvement , determine contribution genetic polymorphism symptom presentation disease course .</detailed_description>
