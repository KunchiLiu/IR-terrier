	<brief_summary>Prior preclinical clinical study show tumor patient advance melanoma contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) anti-tumor reactivity . These TIL expand laboratory large number , reinfused patient . Using chemotherapy regimen selectively kill lymphocyte , single institution Phase II study 35 patient show 51 % objective response rate TIL interleukin-2 injection . In present trial would like investigate whether achieve similar result Hadassah Phase II study , determine feasibility apply approach patient advanced melanoma currently treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must metastatic melanoma resectable metastatic lesion sufficient size willing undergo resection experimental purpose . For HLAA0201+ patient , lesion must &gt; 1.5 cm diameter HLAA0201 patient , lesion must &gt; 3 cm diameter . Patients must &gt; 18 year age must measurable metastatic melanoma ( addition resect lesion ) . Patients gender must willing practice birth control treatment four month receive preparative regimen . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 , 1 . Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm3 without support filgrastim . Platelet count great 100,000/mm3 . Serum ALT/AST less three time upper limit normal . Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl . Total bilirubin less equal 2 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3 mg/dl . Patients must able understand sign Informed Consent document Tumor/TIL Harvest Less 4 week elapse since prior systemic therapy less six week since prior nitrosourea therapy Women pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect preparative chemotherapy fetus infant . Life expectancy less three month . Patients receive prior treatment antiCTLA4 antibody exclude unless post antiCTLA4 antibody treatment colonoscopy normal normal colonic biopsy . Patients require immediate active treatment symptomatic CNS lesion eligible treatment symptomatic lesion . Cell Infusion Less 4 week elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , less six week since prior nitrosourea therapy . All patient ' toxicity must recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure focal palliative radiotherapy ( nontarget lesion ) within past 4 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect preparative chemotherapy fetus infant . Life expectancy less three month . Requirement systemic steroid therapy . Hemoglobin le 8g/dl unable correct transfusion . Any active systemic infection , coagulation disorder active major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , evidence positive stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . Any form primary secondary immunodeficiency . Must recover immune competence chemotherapy radiation therapy evidence normal ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 absence opportunistic infection . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seropositive HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Patients hepatitis B hepatitis C exclude . The following patient exclude inability receive high dose interleukin2 : Patients exclude history major EKG abnormality , symptom cardiac ischemia arrhythmia LVEF &lt; 45 % cardiac stress test ( stress thallium , stress MUGA , dobutamine , echocardiogram stress test ) Similarly , patient 50 year old great LVEF &lt; 45 % excluded Patients prolonged history cigarette smoking symptom respiratory dysfunction exclude abnormal pulmonary function test evidence FEV1 &lt; 60 % predict . Patients receive prior treatment antiCTLA4 antibody exclude unless subsequent colonoscopy normal normal colonic biopsy ( rule colitis ) . Patients require immediate treatment symptomatic CNS lesion eligible treatment symptomatic lesion resolution symptom .</criteria>
