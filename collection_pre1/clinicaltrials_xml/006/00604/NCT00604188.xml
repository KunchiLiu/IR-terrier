	<brief_title>A Randomized Acceptability Safety Study Suboxone Induction Heroin Users ( P05042 ) ( COMPLETED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Once Suboxone become available widespread clinical use , anticipated opioid-dependent patient seek treatment buprenorphine place directly onto Suboxone . Two strategy good success induct patient onto Suboxone develop : 1 ) `` bridge '' procedure patient initiate therapy Subutex transfer Suboxone , 2 ) direct Suboxone induction procedure . However , control study direct Suboxone induction , clear whether use Subutex-to-Suboxone induction procedure would produce added clinical benefit patient relative direct Suboxone induction . This study address post-marketing commitment European Medicines Agency conduct prospective , control study induction Suboxone . Using prospective , randomize , active-drug-controlled , double-blind double-dummy design , study assess acceptability safety Suboxone heroin user compare clinical response participant induct directly onto Suboxone participant induct first Subutex transfer Suboxone . The dose regimen use induction phase study identical use pivotal efficacy study compare Suboxone Subutex ( Fudala et al , 2003 ) , include Suboxone Summary Product Characteristics . The data collect study include information extent opioid use treatment initiation . Two strategy induct opioid-dependent patient use short-acting opioids ( eg , heroin ) onto Suboxone emerge publish US study . One involve use Subutex `` bridge '' transition Suboxone use Subutex first 2 day transfer directly Suboxone third day . The involves direct Suboxone induction , patient receive Suboxone initial dose follow continued rapid Suboxone dose titration . In pivotal efficacy study , opiate-dependent heroin user assign either Subutex Suboxone group receive induction dose 8 mg Subutex ( administer single 8-mg tablet ) Day 1 16 mg Subutex ( administer two 8-mg tablet ) Day 2 . The 109 participant assign Suboxone receive 16 mg Suboxone ( administer two 8-mg tablet ) Day 3 , 105 participant assign Subutex receive 16 mg Subutex ( administer two 8-mg tablet ) Day 3 . The induction schedule use pivotal trial , Subutex-to-Suboxone bridging procedure use , successful induct heroin-dependent patient onto Suboxone , achieve good compliance result relatively AEs accounting treatment discontinuation . Overall , several large-scale study use Suboxone initial medication conduct good result , appear clear , case pivotal study , patient safely tolerate total dose least 8 mg first day treatment . However , study control , remain unclear whether use Subutex-to-Suboxone induction procedure would produce added clinical benefit patient relative direct Suboxone induction procedure . Furthermore , study direct Suboxone induction outside United States .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must males nonpregnant , nonlactating female . Participants must least 15 year age , either sex , race . Participants ( and/or parent guardian participant age legal consent otherwise unable provide independent consent ) must demonstrate willingness participate study adhere dose visit schedule . Participants must meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , Text Revision ( DSMIVTR ) criteria opioid dependence . Participants must methadone buprenorphinenegative UDS result prior randomization . Each participant must confirm practice adequate contraception . Female volunteer childbearing potential ( include woman less 1 year postmenopausal woman sexually active study ) must agree use medically accept method contraception must surgically sterilize prior screen , receive protocolspecified medication , 30 day stop medication . Women postmenopausal &gt; =1 year ( ie , woman experience 12 consecutive month amenorrhea ) exempt requirement use contraception study . Acceptable method contraception include condom ( male female ) without spermicidal agent , diaphragm cervical cap spermicidal agent , medically prescribe intrauterine device , oral injectable hormonal contraceptive , surgical sterilization ( eg , hysterectomy tubal ligation ) . Female participant childbearing potential must negative urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( betahCG ) test prior enrollment study Participants treatment either Subutex Suboxone require protocol would inconsistent national labeling . Participants unwilling unable comply requirement protocol ( eg , pending incarceration ) situation condition , opinion investigator , may interfere participation study . Participants participate clinical study medication ( ) deliver . Participants know allergy sensitivity buprenorphine naloxone . Participants staff , affiliate , family member staff personnel directly involve study . Participants serious untreated Axis I DSMIVTR psychiatric comorbidity ( eg , actively suicidal homicidal , untreated schizophrenia , etc ) . Polysubstance abuse dependence exclude participant except case unauthorized significant benzodiazepine use require medical detoxification alcohol dependence require medical detoxification . HIVpositive participant clinical acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Methadone buprenorphine maintenance detoxification within 30 day enrollment .</criteria>
