	<detailed_description>HPV DNA virus affect men woman . Approximately 90 type HPV identify , 30 sexually transmit . The common form HPV type 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 . The quadrivalent HPV vaccine test study show previous study effective prevent infection HPV 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 healthy young woman . According report Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) , 80 % woman acquire HPV age 50 . HIV infected woman report high prevalence persistence HPV infection , well increase risk abnormal Pap smear cervical cancer . HPV type 16 18 cause majority cervical cancer worldwide , type 6 11 responsible majority case genital wart . Vaccinations preventable infection particularly important among HIV infect people people HIV compromise immune system ; therefore , infection serious potentially fatal . However , standard vaccination series successful compromise immune system may produce desire immune response vaccine . The HPV vaccine design protect infection HPV type 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 approve FDA use woman age 9 26 . The purpose study determine whether quadrivalent HPV vaccine safe , tolerable , effective produce antibody HPV HIV infect female . The study consist single arm evaluation HPV vaccine immunogenicity safety 3 group base study screen CD4 cell count follow : - Stratum A : CD4 cell count &gt; 350 cells/mm^3 - Stratum B : CD4 cell count &gt; 200 &lt; =350 cells/mm^3 - Stratum C : CD4 cell count &lt; =200 cells/mm^3 In Version 1.0 protocol , target accrual n=67 participant screen HIV viral load &lt; =10,000 copies/mL n=67 participant HIV viral load &gt; 10,000 copies/mL within CD4 stratum , yield n=134 CD4 stratum . In light subsequent finding complete HPV vaccine study , sample size change n=94 participant per CD4 stratum Version 2.0 protocol , stratification screen HIV viral load remove . All Stratum A Stratum B participant enrol protocol Version 1.0 . The study duration 72 week . All participant receive HPV vaccine administer intramuscular injection baseline , Weeks 8 24 . Following injection , participant remain clinic 30 minute observation adverse event . A telephone follow-up home visit study staff perform within 2 day follow injection . Participants return clinic visit Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 28 , 52 , 72 . Most study visit include physical exam , medication review , blood urine collection , answer question sign symptom since previous visit . Some visit include measurement HIV viral load CD4 cell count ; collection endocervical wick , cervical cytobrush anal swab ; oral exam . A subset participant ask provide additional blood sample oral cytobrush specimen .</detailed_description>
