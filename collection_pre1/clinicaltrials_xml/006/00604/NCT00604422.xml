	<brief_title>Evaluation PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( PCCE ) Detection &amp; Classification Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) disorder unknown origin may characterize acute chronic inflammation colon . The extent colonic mucosal inflammation varies among individual , disease almost always involve rectum . Ulcerative colitis require evaluation colonoscopy determine extent severity disease . The PillCam platform offer alternative approach endoscopic visualization colon use capsule endoscopy , swallowable device contain imagers , light source , power source RF transmitter . Advantages PillCam platform include elimination need conscious sedation , minimally invasive , painless nature exam , ability pursue normal daily activity immediately follow procedure . Furthermore , compare standard colonoscopy , PillCam platform may readily accept subject , thereby improve subject ' willingness undergo diagnostic evaluation colon . The PillCam® SB capsule ( formerly M2A® Capsule ) FDA-approved August 2001 small bowel evaluation ingest date 700,000 people worldwide well accepted patient physician well professional society . However , adequate visualization colon achieve standard PillCam™ SB capsule anatomical physiological property colon significantly different small bowel . Moreover , issue limit evaluation colonic mucosa standard PillCam™ SB procedure include unsatisfactory level colon cleanliness slow progression PillCam™ SB capsule colon desire examination time . Therefore , development introduction specially design , customize colon capsule combine dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol allow efficient evaluation colonic mucosa . Further detail PillCam® Colon Capsule Endoscope ( PCCE ) find device description section . In previous study , PillCam colon platform show safe able demonstrate colon polyp cancer . This study extension trial evaluate use PCCE ulcerative colitis already complete Hong Kong ( n=40 ) . This study design assess ability capsule accurately detect inflammatory lesion thus classify extent severity disease subject ulcerative colitis comparison traditional colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
