	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To ascertain objective response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient locally advance metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma treat AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability AZD6244 administer patient hepatocellular carcinoma mild ( Child 's A compensate Child 's B ) liver dysfunction . II . To describe pharmacokinetics ( PK ) AZD6244 patient population compare exploratory fashion establish PK profile patient normal hepatic function . III . To estimate time event function progression , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , ( PFS associate treatment ) , overall survival . IV . To explore , preliminarily , possible correlation baseline mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK ) activation ( i.e. , presence phospho-MEK ) radiographic response time progression . V. To investigate effect AZD6244 MEK kinase activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive single dose selumetinib day 1 undergo blood collection pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample pre-dose ( within 30 min dose ) , 15 30 minute 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 48 hour post-dose . Beginning 48 hour initial dose continue day 21 , patient receive oral selumetinib twice daily . Patients also undergo blood collection PK sample day 15 course 1 . In subsequent course , patient receive selumetinib day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Selumetinib blood concentration quantify high performance liquid chromatography . Patients also undergo tumor biopsy CT ultrasound guidance baseline day 8 . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor tissue evaluate mitogen-activated protein kinase baseline activity post-treatment activity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
