	<brief_title>A Prospective Clinical Study On A Total Hip Resurfacing System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design prospective , multi-center , non-randomized study . It design evaluate effect metal-on-metal acetabular articulate bearing surface . The device use conjunction cement metal femoral resurfacing prosthesis . The objective clinical investigation evaluate safety effectiveness metal-on-metal Recap Total Resurfacing System . Performance assess trough Harris Hip Score , radiographic evaluation various postoperative visit . Adverse event revision document safety assessment . Primary endpoint : - Total Harris hip score - Device revision removal Secondary endpoint : - Total Harris hip score - Radiographic change evidence : I. Acetabular component migration , change angle inclination presence osteolysis II . Femoral component subsidence , femoral neck Fracture presence osteolysis</detailed_description>
