	<brief_summary>Recent work St. Thomas ' validate innovative new design multichannel intraluminal impedance ( MII ) catheter sensitive variation oesophageal volume healthy volunteer patient . This project establish clinical value volume sensitive MII ( vMII ) compare conventional MII acquire simultaneously catheter ( ROC analysis ) . Studies ass : 1 . The accuracy volume measurement correlation symptom volume bolus retention patient dysphagia . 2 . The accuracy volume measurement correlation symptom reflux volume patient reflux disease . Follow study appropriate treatment ass whether symptomatic improvement associate reduction oesophageal volume retention/reflux . The vMII technique apply high resolution manometry ( HRM ) . These investigation complementary vMII ass success failure bolus transport ( occurrence reflux ) HRM ass : 1. oesophageal dysfunction result bolus escape 2. abnormal event gastroâˆ’oesophageal junction ( reflux barrier ) allow reflux occur . reduction oesophageal volume retention / reflux .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Swallowing problem gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) common community important effect health , quality life NHS cost . Furthermore , problem may explain increase rate oesophageal cancer . These concern highlight importance appropriate investigation management symptom . Medications suppress gastric acid relieve symptom many patient ; however improve oesophageal function reduce 'non-acid ' reflux stomach . At least 1 4 patient symptoms despite treatment management individual challenge . Conventional multichannel intraluminal impedance ( MII ) study assess swallow function reflux , assess volume . This important large volume food stick oesophagus failure clear large amount irritant reflux stomach likely cause symptom damage line oesophagus . The propose project build recent work St. Thomas ' new MII technique show detect change oesophageal volume . The aim ass whether volume sensitive MII ( vMII ) useful clinical practice . Patients swallow problem reflux symptom undergo vMII High Resolution Manometry unison combine Catheter Assembly test meal contain barium ( know videofluoroscopy ) visible x-ray . The volume fluid stuck oesophagus refluxing stomach measure vMII videofluoroscopy problem motility assess HRM . The result compare link oesophageal volume , dysmotility symptom examine . Finally study repeat treatment ( videofluoroscopy offer male woman 40 ) see improvement link reduced volume measurement . In routine clinical practice , successful vMII would reduce need barium swallow ( therefore reduce exposure radiation ) improve ability link oesophageal dysfunction reflux event symptom , thus guide management patient fail respond standard treatment . Existing measurement oesophageal function ass presence absence acid ( pH ) , bolus transport ( HRM ) fluid ( conventional MII ) oesophagus , sensitive volume change . It think explain failure establish cause oesophageal symptom patient ( Sifrim Gut 06 ) . Firstly retention reflux large volume oesophagus likely cause symptom . Secondly conventional MII lack sensitivity patient poor empty residual fluid oesophagus much time ( e.g . achalasia , post-fundoplication ) . Volume sensitive MII ( vMII ) novel adaptation catheter technology sensitive volume change oesophagus healthy volunteer ( Fox DDW 06 ) . It non disposable catheter 3mm diameter similar impedance pH manometry catheter routinely use St Thomas ' many hospital well tolerate patient . Study Design Methodology Studies perform two , well-defined patient population represent two cardinal presenting symptom oesophageal disease . 1 . Patients swallow difficulty ( dysphagia ) relate achalasia 2 . Patients reflux symptom refer consideration fundoplication . Individuals ( age 18-65 year ) refer oesophageal laboratory investigation invite participate . All participant undergo complete physical mental health questionnaire , assessment predominant complaint symptom severity . This study test two key issue order compare clinical value volume measurement vMII exist technique two patient population . 1 . Stationary : The accuracy volume measurement acquire vMII patient oesophageal disease compare videofluoroscopy ( gold standard ) . 2 . Ambulatory : The association volume measurement symptom compare conventional pH / MII measurement treatment .</detailed_description>
