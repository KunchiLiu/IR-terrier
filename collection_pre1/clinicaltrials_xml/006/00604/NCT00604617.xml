	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) disease affect lung cause germ spread cough . TB infection currently diagnose skin test limit accuracy . The purpose study look reliability new blood test diagnose TB infection child . Study participant include 300 HIV-infected ( HIV infection viral infection cause disease destroy body 's ability protect infection disease . ) child 500 HIV-uninfected child , age 3 month 5 year , reside Khayelitsha Ravensmead/Uitsig Communities Western Cape Province , South Africa . Study procedure include questionnaire , HIV TB testing , perform blood skin test . Participants may involve study related procedure 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon-Gamma Release Assays Tuberculosis ( TB ) - HIV Co-infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although widely use , tuberculin skin test ( TST ) limit diagnostic accuracy Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tb ) infection . TST sensitivity particularly limited child compromise immune status due HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) infection , young age and/or severe malnutrition . Very limited data exists regard diagnostic utility Interferon Gamma Release Assays ( IGRAs ) detect M. tb infection child . The propose study address major gap current knowledge regard diagnosis M. tb infection HIV-infected child may powerful tool spur policy change would dramatically improve health child country endemic tuberculosis ( TB ) HIV . The primary objective study assess agreement TST IGRAs HIV-infected uninfected child less equal age 5 assess performance TST IGRAs across standard gradient M. tb exposure HIV-infected uninfected child less equal age 5 . The secondary objective study measure impact potential interaction confound variable TST IGRAs HIV-infected uninfected child less equal age 5 identify factor modify child 's response TST IGRAs time . This study prospective community-based study set highly endemic HIV TB , agreement TST IGRAs assess 800 child , age 3 month 5 year , influence M. tb exposure , HIV status , cellular immunity , nutritional status age evaluate . Subjects include HIV-infected ( N=300 ) uninfected ( N=500 ) child variable degree M. tb exposure . The inclusion child know household TB contact result measure background community M. tb exposure set high annual risk M. tb infection ( ARI ) . Active contact investigation child expose newly diagnose adult TB index case household allow creation standardize M. tb exposure gradient serve surrogate measure M. tb infection absence exist gold standard . After determination household membership , researcher administer standard questionnaire , ass M. tb exposure , TB disease HIV status , collect approximately 6-8 ml blood IGRAs , place TST ( phlebotomy ) read TST 48-72 hour . In sub-groups child enrol first 18 month , TST , IGRAs measure cellular immunity repeat 3 , 6 , 12 24-months post enrollment . This study design meet guideline complete accurate reporting study diagnostic accuracy . There one study site ( The Desmond Tutu TB Center , Stellenbosch University , Tygerberg , Cape Town , South Africa ) . Study enrollment occur 3 year . The expected duration subject participation range 2 day 24 month . The primary ( dependent ) outcome M. tb infection define TST , T. Spot Tb , Quantiferon-Gold In-tube ( QTF ) complete baseline . The secondary ( dependent ) outcome M. tb infection define TST , T. Spot Tb , QTF complete 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month . The primary independent outcome M. tb infection define M. tb contact score . The secondary independent outcome HIV status , age , nutritional status , cellular immunity ( CD4 count ) .</detailed_description>
