	<brief_title>A Safety/Efficacy Study Intra-coronary Tenecteplase During Balloon Angioplasty Treat Heart Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study gather preliminary data regard angiographic efficacy administration low-dose adjunctive intracoronary ( IC ) tenecteplase primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Efficacy assess measurement angiographic characteristic culprit lesion well measurements epicardial flow myocardial perfusion territory infarct-related artery . This study also evaluate safety administer low-dose IC tenecteplase subject undergoing primary PCI STEMI treat standard therapy ( aspirin , clopidogrel , glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ) . Safety endpoint include incidence death , recurrent myocardial infarction ( MI ) , abrupt vessel closure , subacute stent thrombosis , TIMI major minor bleed event . Prompt reperfusion therapy primary PCI patient STEMI improve clinical outcome salvage myocardial tissue . The propose pilot trial randomize , placebo-controlled trial evaluate effectiveness safety adjunctive low-dose IC tenecteplase conjunction standard medical therapy primary PCI STEMI . We hypothesize low-dose IC tenecteplase enhance fibrinolysis site culprit lesion lead reduce microvascular dysfunction . As reduced dose tenecteplase inject directly coronary artery increase local concentration drug minor systemic effect , improve safety profile also expect mode administration .</detailed_description>
