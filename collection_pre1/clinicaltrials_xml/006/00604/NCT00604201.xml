	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness treat patient severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) myelopdysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) peripheral blood stem cell family member umbilical cord blood stem cell unrelated donor . Patients SAA MDS treatment fail available may eligible study . Candidates may tissue-matched sibling match unrelated donor must family member partial tissue type match . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Insertion central intravenous ( IV ) line ( plastic tube ) large vein . The tube use give donated stem cell antibiotic medicine , transfusion red blood cell platelet , collect blood sample . - Preparatory chemotherapy ( fludarabine , cyclophosphamide anti-thymocyte globulin ) total body irradiation suppress immunity prevent rejection donate cell . - Infusion donate stem cell umbilical cord cell . - Immune suppression drug tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil prednisone prevent rejection donate cell prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , complication stem cell transplant donor immune cell destroy patient healthy tissue . The average hospital stay stem cell transplantation 3 4 week . Patients return frequent follow-up visit first 2 4 month transplantation . Once patient return home , refer physician ask send result laboratory test NIH researcher least every 3 month first 3 year annually thereafter . Patient follow-up visit schedule NIH 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 year transplantation monitor sign disease post-transplantation complication , infection GVHD . After 5 year , participant offer opportunity enroll NHLBI long-term evaluation follow-up care protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplant Using Peripheral Cord Blood Stem Cells Treat Severe Aplastic Anemia Myelopdysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) life-threatening bone marrow disorder . For SAA patient , long term survival achieve immunosuppressive treatment . However , patient treat immunosuppressive therapy , one quarter one third respond , 50 percent responder relapse . Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation either HLA-matched sibling match unrelated donor cure 70 percent patient SAA 30-60 percent patient MDS . Unfortunately , patient disorder suitable candidate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) due advanced age lack histocompatible donor . For patient , transplantation use unrelated cord blood ( UCB ) show reasonable alternative transplant strategy . The advantage UCB transplant ease rapidity availability , requirement le perfect HLA match , low rate graft versus host disease compare mismatch bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplant . The major disadvantage UCB transplantation adult limit number nucleate cell contain within cord unit result prolonged neutropenia failure engraftment contribute infection transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) . In order harness advantage UCB availability overcome disadvantage delay neutrophil recovery , propose test whether co-administration unrelated umbilical cord blood relatively low number highly purified haploidentical peripheral blood CD34+ cell related donor might promote rapid engraftment reduce TRM secondary prolong neutropenia associate conventional UCBT . This research protocol therefore design evaluate safety effectiveness co-infusion unrelated umbilical cord blood haploidentical CD34 plus cell relate donor follow nonmyeloablative condition neutropenic patient SAA MDS refactory anemia ( RA ) proven refractory medical therapy . Subjects receive novel non-myeloablative immunosuppressive conditioning regimen cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , horse ATG one dose total body irradiation ( 200cGy ) follow infusion allograft . The haploidentical stem cell product T-cell deplete enriched CD34 plus cell use Miltenyi CliniMacs system . To reduce TRM secondary prolong neutropenia associate conventional UCB transplantation , haploidentical CD34+ stem cell co-infused single UCB unit ( serologically match great equal 4/6 HLA locus ) . The primary endpoint donor engraftment day 42 ( define ANC great 500 either haplo donor , cord , combine ) . Secondary endpoint include standard transplant outcome variable non-hematological toxicity , incidence severity acute chronic GVHD , relapse disease . We also evaluate ANC recovery ( ANC great 500 cells/microl ) day 22 , 100 day 200 day treatment relate mortality ( TRM ) novel transplant approach . Health related quality life also assess pre-transplant 30 100 day poste transplant , every 6 month 5 year post transplant .</detailed_description>
