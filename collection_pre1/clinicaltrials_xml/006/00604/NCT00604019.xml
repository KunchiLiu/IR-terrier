	<brief_title>Dopamine Versus Norepinephrine Treatment Vasopressor Dependent Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question/Hypothesis : The initial selection vasopressor norepinephrine comparison dopamine result decrease mortality patient septic shock . Study Design/Source Population : This trial single-center , prospective , randomize , open-label comparison dopamine versus norepinephrine initial vasopressor patient present septic shock . The study take place Rush University Medical Center , 600 bed facility . Patients transfer medical intensive care unit emergency room ( ER ) , general medical floor , outside hospital . Patients eligible great 18 year age , present diagnosis SIRS plus suspect documented source infection . Patients eligible found hypovolemic and/or hemorrhagic etiology vasodilatory shock another etiology SIRS . Patients medical intensive care unit present septic shock randomize receive either dopamine norepinephrine first-line vasopressor septic shock . Randomization base upon whether patient present odd even day week . For example , patient present third would randomize dopamine present ICU fourth would randomize norepinephrine treatment arm . The study investigator accept randomization scheme truly randomize , however patient present sepsis dependent day week . For example , timeline patient present sepsis unpredictable therapy septic shock start immediately upon diagnosis , therefore selection vasoactive agent ( norepinephrine dopamine ) really determined date patient 's presentation , rather investigator . All patient treat accord recommendation Surviving Sepsis Campaign ( early-goal direct therapy include fluid resuscitation , early appropriate antimicrobial therapy , strict glycemic control , consideration steroid replacement patient relative adrenal insufficiency ) . Patients present hemodynamic instability first treat initial fluid resuscitation encompass either 500ml 1000ml crystalloid 300ml 500ml colloid , depend clinician 's preference . The administration titration vasopressor direct achieve mean arterial pressure ≥ 60 mmHg systolic pressure ≥ 90 mmHg . If predetermine maximum dose reach initial vasopressor , addition vasopressin continuous dose 0.04 units/min initiate . Patients still require hemodynamic support start infusion phenylephrine . The primary endpoint all-cause 28-day mortality . Secondary endpoint include length stay intensive care unit , organ dysfunction/failure , occurrence dysrhythmia 's . The study approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) human experimentation . Data collect include baseline characteristic , laboratory parameter , microbiology , APACHE II score , occurrence dysrhythmia 's , survival . Definition Outcome : Primary outcome- All cause 28 day mortality Secondary outcome- Length stay ICU ( day ) , organ dysfunction/failure ( MODS SOFA score ) , occurrence dysrhythmia 's dopamine norepinephrine ( sinus tachycardia &gt; 20 % increase heart rate baseline presence abnormal atrial ventricular rhythm base EKG ) Definition Exposure : Therapy either dopamine norepinephrine follow primary secondary outcome vasopressor therapy longer required hemodynamic support . Statistical Analysis : The primary outcome variable survival . The exposure variable whether patient receive dopamine norepinephrine hemodynamic support set septic shock . The primary outcome survival compare via Chi-square test utilize time-to-event model Kaplan-Meier test . We anticipate similar mortality rate two vasopressor treatment group . We analyze baseline demographic two treatment group . Comparison baseline categorical continuous data complete use Chi-square t-test , respectively . If appear imbalance baseline characteristic confound variable address utilizing Cox-proportional Hazards model final analysis . The occurrence secondary outcome length stay organ dysfunction/failure analyze use t-test . The main secondary outcome evaluate occurrence dysrhythmia 's . The dysrhythmia 's compare group utilize Chi-square test . One particular confound variable secondary endpoint patient 's prior cardiac history , balance base upon randomization vasopressor therapy . Unfortunately , septic shock expect mortality approximately 40-60 % . We look 20 % reduction mortality rate would require n=252 sample size achieve power 80 % . The result aid clinicians treat patient septic shock selection initial vasopressor agent . The external validity study limit since single-center evaluation high proportion patient underlying malignancy and/or immunocompromised co-morbid condition , could increase 28 day mortality comparison institution ; however strengthen internal validity . Two potential way overcome limitation perform sub-group analysis and/or Gray 's survival analysis.7</detailed_description>
