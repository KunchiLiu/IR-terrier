	<brief_title>Development Auditory Skills Young Deaf Children With Bilateral Cochlear Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study track patient outcomes bilateral cochlear implant recipient cohort child , age 12 36 month time surgery , receive two implant operation two different surgery initial fitting device separate six month . Acquisition auditory milestone speech recognition skill , underpin development speak language , assessed battery outcome measure typically use quantify implant benefit . In addition , global quality life communicative performance assess parental proxy . Performance track 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month device use . The study also identify variable may predict degree bilateral implant benefit young child ( e.g. , age implant , pre-implant hearing threshold , communication mode , family socioeconomic status , post-implant aid threshold , simultaneous vs. stag placement device ) .</detailed_description>
