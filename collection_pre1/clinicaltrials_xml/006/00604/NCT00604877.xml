	<brief_summary>This study examine hypothesis 6 month treadmill aerobic exercise training improve fibrinolysis ( clot defense mechanism ) vasomotor function chronic hemiparetic ( muscular weakness partial paralysis restrict one side body ) stroke patient compare control intervention , change associate reduced plasma insulin level improve insulin sensitivity / glucose metabolism population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause disability third lead cause death United States . Each year approximately 750,000 individual suffer stroke , remain high risk recurrent stroke cardiovascular event . Incidence stroke nearly doubles successive decade older adult , 90 % stroke occur individual 55 year age . Following stroke , physical inactivity advance age increase incidence elevate insulin level insulin resistance syndrome , powerful factor heighten risk recurrent stroke myocardial infarction ( MI ) impair fibrinolysis vasomotor reactivity . Currently , prevention recurrent stroke MI depend best medical management , include antiplatelet therapy , limited efficacy . Though aerobic exercise training ( AEX ) show improve insulin-glucose metabolism , fibrinolysis profile , vasomotor reactivity healthy elderly type 2 diabetic , data effect AEX insulin sensitivity relate vascular endothelial cell function chronic hemiparetic stroke population . This trial address significant public health gap , aerobic exercise rehabilitation therapy never systematically study mean improve cardiovascular health profile population .</detailed_description>
