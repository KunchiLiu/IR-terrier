	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Vitamin D Adult Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance Vitamin D fat-soluble vitamin necessary maintain bone health maximizes calcium absorption gastrointestinal tract . Our primary source vitamin D skin synthesis follow exposure solar UV-B irradiation . Natural dietary source limit led fortification milk baby formula vitamin D.1 Vitamin D deficiency reduces dietary calcium absorption 10-15 % whereas 30 40 % absorbed vitamin D level adequate.2 Although effect vitamin D primarily calcium homeostasis , vitamin D receptor find many different cell within body suggest vitamin D impact beyond bone . Several epidemiological study show association vitamin D prevalence multiple sclerosis3 , type 1 diabetes4 ; 5 , cancer6 . More recently , low vitamin D associate low lung function7 ; 8 raise possibility vitamin D may influence pulmonary status . The active metabolite , 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D , number action may relevant respiratory disease . It inhibit formation matrix metalloproteinases , inhibits fibroblast proliferation influence collagen synthesis , could influence tissue remodelling pulmonary airway . Vitamin D deficiency : Definitions Vitamin D adequacy traditionally assess use circulate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) level . Concentrations 25 nmol/L associate rickets histologically evident osteomalacia indicate severe deficiency . Levels 25 50 nmol/L indicative moderate deficiency associate mild elevation parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) levels.9 However , grow body literature suggest level 75 nmol/L inadequate . For example , healthy individual vitamin D supplementation live work sun-rich environment ( i.e . lifeguard ) 25OHD level 100 158 nmol/L.10 Furthermore , vitamin D supplementation reduce fracture rate improve bone mineral density ( BMD ) serum 25OHD level &gt; 100 nmol/L.11 ; 12 And finally , 25OHD level 75 100 nmol/L result maximal suppression PTH maximize calcium absorption gastrointestinal tract.13 ; 14 This evidence support notion ideal target serum 25OHD level approximates 75 nmol/L high . Vitamin D deficiency Cystic Fibrosis Despite routine supplementation , prevalence vitamin D deficiency cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common range 20 80 % , depend definition use categorize normal range.15-20 The etiology low vitamin D CF poorly understand contribute factor include decreased gastrointestinal absorption , impaired hydroxylation vitamin D21 , reduce sun exposure combine increase use sunscreen , seasonal influence well geographical location . Low bone mineral density well document CF although bone disease CF likely multifactorial , vitamin D deficiency implicate etiologic factor15 ; 17 ; 19 ; 22 . Although study show clear relationship vitamin D low bone density , plausible sub-optimal serum vitamin D level may aggravate bone disease population normalizing level maximize bone health . Furthermore , fracture risk appear increase CF population17 ; 19 ; 23 . Vitamin D supplementation elderly osteoporotic subject show reduce fracture , improve BMD decrease falls11 study examine effect vitamin D supplementation CF16 ; 18 ; 24 . Treatment vitamin D deficiency CF Several form vitamin D supplementation use attempt improve calcium homeostasis normalize serum vitamin D level CF include cholecalciferol ( animal form ) , ergocalciferol ( plant form ) , calcitriol ( active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ) . Which form vitamin D much need normalize serum level effectively CF unknown . Hanly et al assess response 800 IU daily cholecalciferol minimum 4 week twenty adolescent young adult CF . Serum level 25OHD increase although several subject remain normal range despite supplementation.16 In publish randomized placebo-controlled trial , Haworth et al study 30 adult CF show calcium cholecalciferol supplementation reduce rate bone turnover bone loss although reach statistical significance . Interestingly however , serum 25OHD level unchanged despite additional 800 IU cholecalciferol daily 12 months.24 Pilot work recently publish CF population show additional cholecalciferol successfully increase serum 25OHD levels.25 This study retrospective review randomize clinical trial need confirm result . With ergocalciferol , Lark et al find absorption significantly low highly variable adult CF compare controls.26 Furthermore , patient demonstrate poor conversion ergocalciferol 25OHD raise possibility impaired hydroxylation hepatic enzyme , 25-hydroxylase . In 2005 , Boyle et al show even high-dose ergocalciferol ( 50-100,000 IU weekly ) , serum level correct vitamin D deficiency target level 75 nmol/L subject CF.18 Some study show cholecalciferol efficacious ergocalciferol correct vitamin D deficiency non-CF population.27 ; 28 Possible mechanisms differential response supplemental vitamin D include difference affinity vitamin D-binding protein two calciferol increase affinity hepatic 25-hydroxylase cholecalciferol . Finally , one study publish show short-term use calcitriol , ( 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D ) increase calcium absorption CF serum 25OHD level remain unchanged.29 In summary , many study document vitamin D deficiency CF population however paucity literature evaluate treatment regimen correct deficiency . One may ask study clinically relevant outcome fracture rate change bone mineral density rather biochemical marker . Although definitely important clinical outcome examine , feel CF population unique factor affect absorption fat therefore difficult estimate amount supplementation need achieve optimal serum level ( i.e . &gt; 75 nmol/L ) 25OHD . Changes serum level see within 4-8 week whereas change bone mineral density take year detect . If vitamin D supplementation inadequate achieve optimal serum level , change BMD fracture may see study result may falsely negative . By determine dosage require achieve optimal serum level first , study provide important information researcher use long-term controlled clinical trial . Research Question Aim The main aim research question test primary hypothesis study , namely , Does 12 week additional 5000 IU daily cholecalciferol increase serum 25OHD level adult CF vitamin D deficiency relative placebo ?</detailed_description>
