	<brief_title>Treatment Surgical Scars With Fractional Photothemolysis Versus Pulse Dye Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE FOR THE PROJECT Surgical scar challenge condition treat . The aesthetic outcome surgical scar great importance patient physicians reconstructive surgery . The current approach treatment surgical scar range non-invasive approach aggressive treatment re-excision ablative resurfacing laser . Fractional photothemolysis new technology whereby microthermal zone injury skin create trigger wound heal response , lead skin repair mechanism improve appearance textural change associate surgical scar . Fractional photothemolysis ( Fraxel SR laser , Reliant technology , Inc ) new technology whereby microthermal zone injury skin create trigger wound heal response , lead skin repair mechanism improve appearance textural change associate surgical scar . Fractionated resurfacing , significant proven efficacy improve textural pigmenatary abnormality benign side effect profile , represent promise novel treatment surgical scar . Aim : Comparison outcome half surgical scar treat Fraxel SR ( Reliant Technologies , Inc. ) laser versus outcome contralateral half surgical scar treat V-Beam Pulse Dye Laser SIGNIFICANCE : The cosmetic outcome surgical scar paramount importance surgeon patient treat cosmetic reconstructive surgery . It impossible surgeon predict wound heal property individual patient particular anatomic site thus , little certainty offer patient cosmetic outcome surgical scar . SUBJECTS IN THE PROJECT : Inclusion Criteria : For inclusion , subject must : 1 . Be least 18 year old ; 2 . Be otherwise healthy ; 3 . Be treat Dr. Kouba skin cancer surgery plastic surgery procedure 4 . Agree attend 6 session post Mohs surgery ( 2-4 laser treatment session 2 follow-up visit post-laser ) 5 . Be able understand requirement study , risk involve , able sign inform consent form ; 6 . Agree follow undergo study-related procedure . Exclusion criterion : A . Patients meet criterion and/or fail follow post-operative instruction make post-operative clinic appointment . B . The control study side scar treat V-Beam Pulse Dye Laser C. We speak patient Henry Ford Dermatology regard participation study . We ensure patient understand voluntary nature participation study . They sign informed consent . In addition , ask patient give u assessment side surgical wound well improvement , side treat Fraxel laser versus side treat V-Beam Pulse Dye Laser . PROJECT DESIGN AND PROCOTOL : 1 . A comparison trial surgical scar treat Fraxel SR Laser ( Reliant Technologies , Inc. ) versus V-Beam Pulse Dye Laser ( Candela Corporation ) 15 patient underwent Mohs surgery resultant cosmetic surgical reconstruction Henry Ford Health System Department Dermatology . 2 . At minimum 2 month post surgical reconstruction , patient eligible inclusion research study . During 2 week study , one side surgical scar treat Fraxel SR ( Reliant Technologies , Inc. ) half treat V-Beam Pulse Dye Laser ( Candela Corporation ) aesthetic improvement scar</detailed_description>
