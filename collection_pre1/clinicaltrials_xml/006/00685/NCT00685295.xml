	<brief_title>Fentanyl Administered Intraorally Rapid Treatment Orthopedic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients initially deem eligible study consideration , MGH ED nursing triage , X-ray order suspect isolated extremity injury triage acuity level `` Minor '' . Study staff ( physician ) monitor ED registration triage area assess whether triaged patient potentially eligible . For ED patient minor isolated injury , X-rays often order triage , supervise physician ( nurse practitioner ) available examine patient direct care . Either triage ( patient undergo care location ) patient move ED 's Minor Surgery area , supervise healthcare provider approach immediately individual 's evaluation patient , pain medication administer , begin process eligibility ascertainment . If provider agree patient may candidate study , next step provider ask patient study staff may approach discuss trial . If patient agrees study staff approach discus trial , study personnel ( EM resident Attending-level physician ) introduce healthcare provider potential subject . Study staff converse patient study 's aim , methodology , risk , confirm eligibility determine patient consent participate . Patients approach , determine ineligible , data record , age race/ethnicity reason ineligible . If eligible patient provide write consent manner form dictate Partners guideline , study procedure commence . For eligible patient give consent , study physician emphasize patient care unaffected decision . No contact occur study staff patient . No identify information patient record , age race/ethnicity record . ( Recording information allow subsequent assessment selection bias , also help search pattern patient type refuse analgesia trial participation . ) The actual medication administration involve follow step : 1 . Patients participate study identify place `` room '' ( stretcher actual ED room ) MGH ED 's Minor Multipurpose ( MIMP ) area ; 2 . RNs obtain study medication pair ( buccal tablet + oral tablet ) computerize medication storage area - RNs take next-numbered medication pair MGH Research Pharmacy-prepared drug packaging ; 3 . Actual medication administer licensed physician ( study co-investigator , EM resident Attending physician MGH ) , co-investigator monitoring patient endpoint assessment - physician administer medication/placebo inform neither patient clinical study staff , identity medication/placebo pair give . Patients monitor study physician co-investigator physically present patient , total 120 minute administration medication . They ask q-5-minutes , 60 minute , rate pain degree nausea , well describe adverse reaction medication . Both pain nausea level record use 10-point scale . Use scale common pain literature , emerge tool evaluation nausea.1,2 Data collection analgesia efficacy cease 60 minute , patient monitor least another 60 minute maximize safety ; patient assess discharge suitability treat clinicians/nurses fashion ED patient receive opioids . Vital sign ( respiratory rate , blood pressure , heart rate , pulse oximetry ) monitor two hour study . Continuous pulse oximetry use first study hour , q5-minute spot-check pulse oximetry use second study hour ; pulse oximetry monitor change continuous mode second study hour spot-check reading fall 98 % . Other ( non-pulse oximetry ) vital sign monitor q5-minutes first study hour , q15-minutes second study hour . These vital sign monitor parameter represent minimum study subject ; treat clinician study staff physician increase frequency vital sign monitor discretion . Any study subject admit hospital , discharge care responsible adult . At conclusion data collection period , patient ask would want receive medication future . Other 24-hour telephone call ( make patient agree ) , intend assess delay problem nausea/vomiting , study procedure intervention .</detailed_description>
