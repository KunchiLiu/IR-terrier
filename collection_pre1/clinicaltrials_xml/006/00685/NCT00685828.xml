	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know dose imatinib mesylate effective treat gastrointestinal stromal tumor . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different dos imatinib mesylate compare well work treat patient unresectable metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare outcomes patient unresectable metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor express KIT ( CD117 ) treat low-dose imatinib mesylate v high-dose imatinib mesylate . Secondary - To assess response rate patient treat two different dos imatinib mesylate . - To assess toxicity two different dos imatinib mesylate patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , measurability disease ( measurable v non-measurable ) , WHO performance status ( 0-2 v 3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive low-dose oral imatinib mesylate daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive high-dose oral imatinib mesylate twice daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In event disease progression , patient arm I may cross arm II receive high-dose imatinib mesylate . Patients continue progress despite treatment high-dose imatinib mesylate remove study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
