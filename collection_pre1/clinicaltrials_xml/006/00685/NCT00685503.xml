	<brief_summary>This study examine whether drug ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) help prevent vision loss people macular telangiectasia , condition new blood vessel grow retina back eye leak . Such change blood vessel see disease associate change body chemical call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Ranibizumab anti-VEGF drug effective treating another eye disease , age-related macular degeneration , similar change eye blood vessel . People 18 year age old macular telangiectasia eye new blood vessel growth least one eye may eligible study . They must vision good 20/400 study eye . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Ranibizumab injection study eye least four time 12 week . Depending response treatment side effect , additional injection may give every 4 week 1 year . The eye numbed injection eye area clean antiseptic . Antibiotic drop use 3 day follow injection prevent infection . - Evaluations start treatment , time injection , 8 week last treatment : - History physical examination . - Eye examination dilation , microperimetry photography : The eye examination measure visual acuity , eye pressure eye movement . For microperimetry test , subject sit front computer screen press button see light screen . Measurements photographs retina also take . - Fluorescein indocyanine green angiography examine blood vessel eye : A dye call fluorescein indocyanine green inject vein arm . The dye travel vein blood vessel eye . A camera take picture dye flow blood vessel . - Pregnancy test : Women able become pregnant urine pregnancy test ranibizumab injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Injections Treat Macular Telangiectasia With New Blood Vessel Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinal telangiectasis group rare , idiopathic retinal vascular anomaly affect retinal capillary irregular capillary dilation incompetence occur macula . This group 2 Gass classification idiopathic juxtafoveal telangiectasia fluorescein angiography show leakage capillary dilation . These patient typically diagnose fifth sixth decade life . Both sex may affect . Minimal exudation , superficial retinal crystalline deposit , right-angle venule characterize disorder . As disease progress , intraretinal pigment plaque intraretinal eventually subretinal/choroidal neovascularization develop . The pathogenesis disease unknown . Because leakage retinal vessel also find neovascularization , possible vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) may implicate disease . The purpose study evaluate possible role ranibizumab treatment eight participant macular telangiectasia hyperfluorescence fluorescein angiography , vision well 20/400 , neovascularization . The primary outcome study proportion participant lose 15 letter ETDRS BCVA 12 month compare baseline . The secondary outcome measure one year include proportion participant lose 10 letter , change central retinal thickness , mean change ETDRS BCVA , extent fluorescein leakage , change fundus autofluorescence change size neovascular membrane , change central retinal sensitivity . This pilot study design evaluate feasibility potential efficacy treat patient macular telangiectasia large , phase III study within organization MAC TEL Research Group , sponsor Lowy Foundation . Currently , research group enrol 200 patient affected condition natural history study 22 international clinical center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant must understand sign inform consent . Participant must least 18 year age . Participant must macular telangiectasia eye . Participant must neovascularization study eye . Participant must vision loss well 20/400 study eye . Participant must clear ocular medium adequate pupillary dilation permit good quality stereoscopic fundus photography . All woman childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test baseline , willing undergo test immediately prior injection monthly least 2 month follow last dose ranibizumab . Safety toxicity ranibizumab yet investigate child . Further , unlikely young participant able comply examination intravitreal injection . Therefore , participant age 18 exclude participation study . This ocular condition commonly find participant age 18 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History ( within past five year ) myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident evidence severe cardiac disease ( apparent electrocardiogram abnormality , clinical history unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , revascularization procedure within six month prior baseline , atrial ventricular tachyarrythmias require ongoing treatment ) . History stroke within 12 month study entry . History within past 30 day chronic ocular periocular infection ( include history ocular herpes zoster ) . Current acute ocular periocular infection . Any major surgical procedure within one month study entry . Known serious allergy fluorescein dye AND either indocyanine green dye iodine , shellfish . Indocyanine green dye contraindicate patient iodine shellfish allergy .</criteria>
