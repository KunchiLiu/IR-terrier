	<detailed_description>The 76 week treatment period follow 12 week reversibility phase extend another 12 week order allow participant complete week 88 visit continue study Extension study ready implement . In optional extension , participant assign treatment arm assign base study . The total duration extension study 116 week ; include 2 year treatment period , follow 12 week reversal phase . A post-extension study follow-up phone call complete 12 week discontinuation completion study treatment . Participants previously treat anacetrapib placebo invite 4:1 ratio optional extend reversal phase . The total duration extend reversal phase 1 year . Participants previously treat anacetrapib DEFINE study follow periodically 4 year determine plasma level anacetrapib . Participants also invite participate sub-study consist one clinic visit measure anacetrapib level plasma subcutaneous adipose tissue .
