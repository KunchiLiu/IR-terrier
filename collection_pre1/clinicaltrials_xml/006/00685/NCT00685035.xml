	<brief_summary>Our primary hypothesis airway clearance therapy sine waveform HFCWO use high inflation pressure combine low high oscillator frequency result great sputum production compare sine waveform HFCWO low inflation pressure mid-frequency oscillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Airway Clearance Therapy Cystic Fibrosis Using Same VEST Therapy Device But With Different Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cystic fibrosis ( CF ) perform daily airway clearance therapy facilitate removal secretion airways . Many different technique available achieve currently consensus form therapy effective . High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) use CF patient throughout United States abroad . To perform therapy , patient wear vest fit entire torso connect air compressor . The compressor generate oscillate air pulse transmit lung , thereby mobilize secretion . The commonly used device The Vestâ„¢ Airway Clearance System , ( Hill-Rom Inc , St Paul , MN ) . Adjustment inflation pressure frequency oscillation affect volume displace air flow air measure mouth patient . Previous study indicate form therapy effective traditional cumbersome form therapy . However , unclear inflation pressure oscillator frequency provide optimal airway clearance . Some study sine waveform HFCWO report large volume air displacement high air flow measure mouth use combination high inflation pressure either low ( 7 - 10 Hz ) high frequency ( 18 - 20 Hz ) , CF center United States use HFCWO low pressure combine mid-range frequency ( 10 - 14 Hz ) . Furthermore , previous study assess affect sine waveform HFCWO setting sputum production . As result , consensus pressure frequency setting efficacious CF patient .</detailed_description>
