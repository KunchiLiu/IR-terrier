	<brief_title>Effectiveness Extended Treatments Drug Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There considerable evidence treatment drug use disorder lead substantial improvement substance use psychosocial problem severity . However , significant percentage patient relapse problematic level substance use primary treatment , require additional treatment episode . Patients therefore frequently refer continue care program prevent relapse decrease probability additional rehabilitation treatment . However , current model continue care may adequate long-term management chronic , relapse disorder substance dependence . One possible approach improve management drug dependence adaptive treatment regime , combine low intensity monitoring counseling patient well step care protocol increase intensity treatment warrant deterioration status functioning . However , addiction management protocol may require incentive feature make long-term participation appeal . Cocaine dependent patient complete 2 week intensive outpatient treatment ( IOP ) randomly assign one follow intervention : ( 1 ) continue participation IOP without additional intervention ( TAU ) ; ( 2 ) TAU plus adaptive protocol include monitoring , feedback , brief counseling via telephone taper schedule 24 month , intensive face-to-face treatment warrant ( TMAC ) ; ( 3 ) TAU adaptive protocol , plus incentive sustain participation ( TMAC-Plus ) . Patients follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month post intake study . Follow-up assessment include measure drug use , treatment process potential mediating factor , psychosocial problem severity , utilization health social service , cost . The two adaptive extend intervention ( TMAC TMAC-Plus ) predict produce good drug use outcomes TAU . TMAC-Plus hypothesized produce good retention drug use outcomes TMAC . Economic analyse determine cost-effectiveness benefit-cost TMAC TMF-Plus relative TAU , . Other analysis test mediation hypothesis , examine potential moderator effect , test impact disease management HIV risk behavior .</detailed_description>
