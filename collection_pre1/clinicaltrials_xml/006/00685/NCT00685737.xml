Dyslipidemia occur imbalance metabolism clearance lipoproteins result lipoprotein overproduction deficiency . Lipid related risk factor atherosclerotic coronary artery disease include elevate level total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( IDL-C ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( VLDL-C ) reduce concentration high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) . This lipid risk profile frequently occur association cardiovascular risk factor ( e.g. , obesity , elevate blood pressure , diabetes mellitus ) , associate premature atherosclerosis ( NCEP , 2002 ) .
