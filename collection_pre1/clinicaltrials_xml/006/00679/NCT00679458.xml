	<brief_title>Randomized , Double-Blind Cross-Over Trial Of Buprenorphine Low-Dose Naloxone Versus Buprenorphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment chronic pain typically rely effectiveness opioid analgesic , however , side effect potential user develop tolerance addiction may make physician hesitant prescribe . The development opioid analgesic few side effect decrease potential tolerance addiction would increase ability safely effectively treat pain . This study determine whether addition ultra-low dose naloxone , opioid antagonist , buprenorphine , opioid analgesic pain medication , increase analgesic potency reduces side effect compare buprenorphine alone . Low dose naloxone add buprenorphine show increase potency reduce side effect buprenorphine animal study human study healthy volunteer . The current study aim extend finding assess analgesic potency side effect 15:1 ratio buprenorphine naloxone sample 12 outpatient participant moderate pain ( 4 great pain intensity ) experience opioid analgesic . Participants randomly assign begin blind treatment start one two medication regimen : IV buprenorphine + ultra-low-dose naloxone IV buprenorphine alone . Participants receive 5 daily dos medication ( 2 day dose ) follow crossover opposite treatment condition 5 additional daily dos . Each study day , participant provide daily pain assessment , receive administration study medication , monitor assessed pain side effect next six hour . Outcomes study include : ( 1 ) pain intensity measure use Brief Pain Inventory , pain intensity numerical rating scale , Beck Depression Inventory , ( 2 ) self-reported side effects/adverse event . After completion study participation , participant resume pre-study pain treatment physician .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet following : 1 . 18 year age old 2 . Have chronic pain related cancer , define pain expect last month , ( i.e . musculoskeletal pain neuropathic pain ) 3 . Report pain moderate moderatelysevere intensity week prior baseline screen visit ( score great equal 4 average pain past week 010 point Pain IntensityNumerical Rating Scale ) 4 . Have use prescription opioid and/or nonopioid analgesic pain least 15 30 day prior initial baseline/screening visit clearance prescribe physician discontinue nonstudyrelated opiate study participation 5 . Willing able comply study procedures 6 . Willing able provide write consent 7 . If female , pregnant lactate willing use acceptable method birth control ( e.g. , condom , IUD , birth control pill , DepoProvera ) Participants must meet following : 1 . Have history dependence opiate , stimulant , alcohol , benzodiazepine , define DSMIV criterion , within past year ( physical dependence prescribe opioid analgesic allow opioid dependence accord DSMIV , i.e . opioid addiction , ) 2 . Use illicit recreational drug ( heroin , cocaine , methamphetamine , marijuana , etc . ) ; use longacting opioid ( i.e. , methadone ) 30 day prior initial screen visit 3 . Concomitant use medication inhibitor CYP3A4 ( e.g. , azole antifungal , macrolide antibiotic , HIV protease inhibitor ) , medication induce CYP3A4 activity ( e.g. , anticonvulsant rifampin ) may alter metabolism buprenorphine 4 . Have medical condition , study physician 's judgment , may interfere safe study participation individual study candidate . Because medical condition may differ term safe participation individual basis , criterion must base physician 's determination medical history , exam , lab test may also involve consultation study candidate 's primacy care physician . Some example medical condition may exclusionary particular individual , however include active tuberculosis , unstable and/or significant cardiovascular liver disease , unstable diabetes ( i.e. , glycosylated hemoglobin A1C 12 % ) , uncontrolled HIV infection , alter renal function ( serum creatinine male female : &gt; 3x upper limit normal ) clinically significant elevate liver enzyme ( ALT AST great 3x upper limit normal ) 5 . Have current neurological disorder ( e.g. , organic brain disease , dementia ) current major psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , schizophrenia , bipolar illness , PTSD ) would make study agent compliance difficult , would compromise informed consent , would jeopardize safety 6 . Have history suicide attempt past 180 day and/or current serious suicidal risk 7 . Have history seizure disorder 8 . Have know allergy sensitivity buprenorphine naloxone 9 . Receiving longacting opioids , methadone , LAAM , sustain release morphine , treatment pain ( due problem initiate buprenorphine treatment among patient receive longacting opioids ) 10 . Have recent surgery major medical procedure could potentially interfere study participation 11 . Any circumstance , opinion investigator , would interfere study participation</criteria>
