	<brief_summary>Adult Tay-Sachs disease Sandhoff diseases caused deficiency enzyme call β-hexosaminidase A , Hex A short . This enzyme locate particular cellular component , call lysosome , inside brain cell . The reason Hex A patient Adult Tay-Sachs disease Sandhoff disease deficient enzyme go mutation , result work well . In healthy people , Hex A efficiently break GM2-ganglioside , by-product cell body . However , patient Adult Tay-Sachs disease Sandhoff disease efficiently break GM2-ganglioside body . Therefore , patient high level by-product brain cell , cause brain unable function normally . There drug call Pyrimethamine . This drug use doctor treat specific type infection call malaria toxoplasmosis . Our laboratory test tube study show Pyrimethamine help Hex A enzyme function normal manner . If Hex A function normally presence Pyrimethamine , drug able restore brain malfunction patient since Hex A efficiently break GM2-ganglioside Pyrimethamine treatment . Although result laboratory test tube study promise Pyrimethamine theoretically restore brain function patient , know Pyrimethamine safe would actually work patient . This study first study ( Phase I study ) test Pyrimethamine treat Adult Tay-Sachs Sandhoff diseases . The objective study see Pyrimethamine safe patient see restore brain function patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Pyrimethamine Patients With GM2 Gangliosidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult Tay-Sachs ( TSD ) Sandhoff disease ( SD ) result deficiency lysosomal heterodimeric β-hexosaminidase A ( Hex A , αβ ) . These disorder characterize progressive neurological deterioration mainly affect motor , cerebral spinocerebellar function . They affect few 1000 people United States . There effective treatment disease . Substantial evidence support disease model TSD SD attribute pathology decrease absent Hex A level neuronal lysosome brain . The problem GM2 - gangliosidosis inability cell metabolize GM2 gangliosides . When residual activity Hex A fall critical threshold level , GM2 ganglioside influx lysosome ( site Hex A activity ) exceed degradation rate excess substrate continuously accumulate . Consequently , lysosomes increase size number , give rise storage disease . The majority mutation Hex A affect ability enzyme obtain and/or retain native 3-dimensional fold endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) intracellular quality control perform retain degrade defective enzyme . Pharmacological chaperone ( PC ) small molecule stabilize native conformation mutant enzyme ER allow escape ER 's quality control system associate degradation pathway ( ERAD ) . PCs potential act drug stabilize native conformation mutant enzyme . In 2006 ExSAR apply orphan drug designation FDA Pyrimethamine ( Pyrimethamine ) treatment patient affect late-onset GM2-gangliosidosis . The application pending positive outcome clinical trial . Pyrimethamine FDA-approved drug readily pass bloodbrain barrier ( BBB ) . It currently use treat malaria toxoplasmosis . Our vitro cell-based study fibroblasts patient show Pyrimethamine function PC Hex A raise intracellular Hex A level . Our hypothesis Pyrimethamine administer adult TSD SD patient improve neurological function health . The objective project ass safety tolerability drug . We first conduct Phase I trial , current study , use Pyrimethamine treat patient affect GM2-gangliosidosis . Hex A B ( αβ ) activity plasma peripheral blood leukocyte also measure . The working hypothesis Phase I trial Pyrimethamine administer accord regimen trial tolerate safe result increase Hex A level blood brain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biochemically genetically confirm diagnosis GM2 Gangliosidosis cause βhexosaminidase deficiency result mutation HEXA HEXB gene , show respond Pyrimethamine treatment previous cell culture experiment ( Maegawa et al . 2006 ) . Must 18 year age old participate study . Able understand cooperate requirement study protocol . Mentally competent , ability understand willingness sign inform consent form . Able travel participate study site . Women childbearing potential must use accepted contraceptive method , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 day prior treatment initiation . Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive method study period , unless documentation infertility exist . Laboratory value ≤2 week prior randomization must within acceptable range . Body weight &gt; 40 kg ( 88 pound ) . Serious medical illness , significant cardiac disease would increase patient ' risk toxicity . Any hematologic related abnormality , especially megaloblastic anemia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , pancytopenia , atrophic glossitis , hematuria , disorder cardiac rhythm , pulmonary eosinophilia , etc . Any active uncontrolled bleeding , patient bleed diathesis ( e.g. , active peptic ulcer disease ) . Possible folate deficiency , individual malabsorption syndrome , alcoholism , pregnancy , receive therapy ( phenytoin ) affect folate level . Any complex disease may confound treatment assessment . Pregnant woman , woman childbearing potential use reliable mean contraception ( Pyrimethamine `` Pregnancy Category C '' product ) . Lactating female potential serious adverse reaction nurse infant . Fertile men unwilling practice contraceptive method study period . Unwilling unable follow protocol requirement . Known hypersensitivity reaction , intolerance adverse reaction Pyrimethamine inactive ingredient ( corn potato starch , lactose , magnesium stearate ) . Evidence systemic infection , anyone opinion investigator would suitable study . Test positive HIV . Test positive hepatitis B hepatitis C. Patients history convulsive disorder , since patient susceptible nervous system toxicity Pyrimethamine . Patients receive investigational treatment indication within past 4 week prior initiation Pyrimethamine treatment . A history cancer type , since Pyrimethamine may carcinogenic . Patients receive immunotherapy type within past 4 week prior initiation Pyrimethamine treatment . Patients receive antifolic drug drug associate myelosuppression , patient receive drug , use combination Pyrimethamine , report induce degree hepatotoxicity : Any condition abnormality may , opinion investigator , compromise safety patient .</criteria>
