	<brief_title>The Prevalence Implications Obstructive Sleep Apnea Population Wound Center</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic non-healing wound often major co-morbidities diabetes cardiovascular disease [ 1 ] . Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) present 24 % middle-aged adult [ 2 ] , far prevalent patient exist cardiovascular disease [ 3 ] . Patients OSA increase risk develop diabetes l [ 4 ] . OSA establish cause hypertension [ 5 ] , estimate prevalence 40 % patient hypertension [ 6-8 ] . Similarly strong association exist OSA , coronary artery disease [ 6 , 7 ] stroke [ 8 ] . OSA may present 50 % patient heart failure [ 9 ] . Patients chronic non-healing wound stand benefit identification treatment severe co-morbidities OSA . Such identification treatment OSA impact survival patient [ 10 , 11 ] , may also contribute improved morbidity via impact wound heal . Several unexplored link exist OSA wound heal . OSA disorder intermittent hypoxia associate increase oxidative stress [ 12 ] . Humans OSA animal model intermittent hypoxia develop impaired vascular function nitric oxide deficiency . Patients OSA impair endothelial function even absence clinically apparent cardiovascular disease [ 13-15 ] . Increased sympathetic activity episodic pressor response well document OSA . Patients OSA increase vascular tone baseline vasoconstriction [ 16 ] . Impaired vascular reactivity hypoxia also demonstrate animal model expose 2 week intermittent hypoxia [ 17 ] . Therefore , patient chronic non-healing wound , OSA likely complicate heal process . OSA disorder oxidative stress vascular impairment likely important co-morbidity patient non-healing wound . Other potential mechanism interaction inflammatory response associate OSA</detailed_description>
