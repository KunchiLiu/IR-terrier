	<brief_title>A Study Galantamine Used Treat Patients With Mild Moderate Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This long-term ( 2-year ) , randomize ( patient assign treatment chance ) , double blind ( neither physician patient know treatment assign ) study galantamine versus placebo subject mild moderately-severe AD . Approximately 2,000 patient participate study . The study length patient approximately 25.5 month . The study consist 3 phase : pretreatment phase , treatment phase , posttreatment phase . The pretreatment phase include 2-week screening period ( obtain patient 's caregiver 's informed consent confirm eligibility study ) baseline visit subject randomly assign , 1 1 ratio , receive either galantamine placebo day morning . Study drug first dispense baseline visit . The treatment phase compose titration period ( study drug introduce gradually ) maintenance period include 9 visit ( 3 conduct telephone ) . The titration period 12 week long , visit occur every 28 day . In first 4 week titration period , subject receive either 8 mg galantamine match placebo , dose increase 16 mg galantamine placebo second 4 week . The dose increase 24 mg galantamine placebo final 4 week titration period investigator believe subject benefit safely tolerate 24 mg/day . If , subject may continue receive 16 mg galantamine placebo end titration period . After titration period , subject enter maintenance period continue take study drug dosage receive end titration period . This dosage may continue end study may change ( either 16 24 mg 24 16 mg ) , depend upon benefit safety change individual patient judge investigator . No dosage exceed 24 mg/day . The posttreatment phase include End-of-Study Visit occur end maintenance period . A follow-up telephone contact ( interview ) conduct 1 month End-of-Study Visit . The effectiveness galantamine evaluate use following tool : Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ; Disability Assessment Dementia ( DAD ) ; Assessment Patient Accommodation Status Caregiver Burden ( APAS CarB ) . Safety evaluation study include monitor vital status institutionalization status , adverse event , vital sign , weight , physical neurologic examination . A Data Safety Monitoring Board , external company , commission study monitor progress study ensure safety patient compromise . The effectiveness hypothesis study galantamine , 16 24 mg per day , superior placebo reduce cognitive decline baseline ( start study drug ) measure MMSE course 2 year . The safety hypothesis mortality rate galantamine 16 24 mg per day treatment group placebo group course 2 year .</detailed_description>
