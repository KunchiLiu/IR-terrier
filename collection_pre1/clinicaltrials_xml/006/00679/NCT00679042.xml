	<brief_summary>In early Phase 1/2 clinical trial use Edmonton Protocol steroid free immunosuppression , investigator University Illinois Chicago ( UIC ) demonstrate safety islet preparation , iset transplantation , medical treatment UIC . Therefore , primary purpose present Phase 3 clinical trial demonstrate safety efficacy allogeneic islet transplantation improve glycemic control Type 1 diabetic patient use UIC protocol develop proven effective Phase 1/2 clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Islet Transplantation Type 1 Diabetic Patients Using University Illinois Chicago ( UIC ) Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase 3 single center , uncontrolled trial 1-4 allogeneic pancreatic islet transplant perform study subject . Follow-up evaluation transplant continue 52 week final islet transplantation . Thereafter , subject may enroll 5-year follow-up study additional 5 year 10 year follow-up study evaluate function islet measure regulate immunosuppressive drug level side effect . The safety islet transplantation depend primarily incidence serious unexpected complication adverse event ability cell isolation laboratory produce uncontaminated islet cell preparation minimal endotoxin content . All study subject follow safety one year . An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) , compose 3 member train medicine and/or organ transplantation , review eligibility safety data within 2 week islet transplantation every two month thereafter . An independent monitor , knowledgeable Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline regulation , monitor study compliance 21 CFR accord ICH GCP Guidelines . Within Clinical Research Center , representative Scientific Advisory Committee Research Subject Advocacy Program monitor safety . These entity report UIC Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , also review safety data annually occurrence serious adverse event . The principal investigator also report serious adverse event US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Success : Islet transplantation consider success subject use insulin , achieve fast glucose level exceed 140 mg/dL three time week , exceed two-hour post-prandial value 180 mg/dL four time week . Partial Success : Subjects reduction insulin requirement achieve insulin independence present reduction HbA1c number hypoglycemic episode consider partial success islet transplantation . Reduction insulin-requirements assess compare pre-transplant insulin requirement record two consecutive day ( expressed insulin unit per kg ) requirement two consecutive day precede subsequent islet infusion , requirement two consecutive day six month two consecutive day one year final transplant . Failure : Absence measurable level C-peptide transplantation consider failure islet cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
