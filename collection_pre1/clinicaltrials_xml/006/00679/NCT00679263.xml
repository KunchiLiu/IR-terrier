	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , single-blind* , parallel group , placebo-controlled , study two dose regimen subject diagnose moderate severe asthma use MN-221 placebo . Subjects randomize receive MN-221 placebo 3:1 ratio , MN-221 : placebo . Subjects randomize receive MN-221 dose active study drug dose visit , subject randomize placebo arm receive placebo dose visit . Approximately 25 subject diagnose moderate severe asthma receive inhaled corticosteroid therapy within one month Screen Visit 1 enrol participate throughout study . Initial dose : - 16 μg/min 15 minute follow 8 μg/min 105 minute ( 2-hour infusion total dose 1,080 μg MN-221 Placebo ) Subsequent dose : - 30 μg/min 15 minute follow 15 μg/min 45 minute ( 1-hr infusion total dose 1,125 μg MN-221 Placebo ) There approximately two four week period dose regimen , time safety review perform proceed next dose level . Subjects screen eligibility continue eligibility determine subject prior administer dose . After initiation intravenous infusion MN-221 placebo , serial spirometry measure approximately 24 hour . For dose evaluation period , subject domicile clinical research unit ( CRU ) 2 night , begin Day -1 , one day dose . Determination continue study eligibility make Day -1 dose level . Day 1 include study drug infusion approximately 24-hour observation period Day 2 allow safety monitoring , serial spirometry , serum PK measurement . Subjects discharge CRU Day 2 . They return CRU approximately 2-4 week later participate subsequent dose group . *This `` modified '' single-blind study subject Investigator blind regard treatment arm .</detailed_description>
