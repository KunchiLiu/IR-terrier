	<brief_summary>Consecutive patient first diagnosis breast cancer identify Tom Baker Cancer Centre ( TBCC ) include study , go receive chemotherapy anthracyclines / Trastuzumab contra-indications CMR study . Besides usual clinical care patient ( e.g . blood sample cycle chemotherapy ; MUGA scan follow cardiac size function ) , patient undergo serial contrast-enhanced CMR study ( , 9-12 month completion chemotherapy ) ; patient see outpatient clinic Dept . Cardiac Sciences / Heart Function Clinic clinical assessment ( include ECG , additional blood test like Troponin-T , BNP , 6-minute-walk-test ) recommendation make medical treatment patient evidence heart failure . Time point CMR clinic assessment co-coordinated regularly schedule test TBCC avoid unnecessary burden patient . The oncologist TBCC blind result CMR study laboratory result , unless participate cardiologist identify clinical need communication . Standardized CMR protocols employed interpretation blind time course chemotherapy cardiotoxic side effect . We test hypothesis , whether CMR useful patient potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy : - Identify patient risk development grade 2-4 cardiotoxic side effect classify NCI guideline ( common toxicity criterion , 2001 , 1-12 ) - Identify image parameter predict early late Cardiotoxicity - Provide additional clinical information optimize medical treatment heart failure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Focus Design : Breast cancer one lead cancer among white African American woman ; incidence increase one 20 1960 one eight today ARMSTRONG 2000 . In Canada alone , approximately 22,000 woman diagnose year breast cancer 5,000 die VERMA 2007 . Surgery , radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy commonly use treatment option . Anthracyclines , especially doxorubicin , class chemotherapeutic agent efficacy variety solid tumor , include breast cancer . Unfortunately , cardiotoxic effect occur cumulative dos limit clinical use doxorubicin . The incidence heart failure le 5 % dose 500 mg/m2 , increase 18 % dose 500 - 550 mg/m2 exceeds 30 % dose 600 mg/m2 1-5 . Although several mechanism propose cardiotoxic effect , little known prevention effective treatment drug-induced cardiomyopathy . The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER-2 ) , also know ErbB2 , member group transmembrane tyrosine kinases involve regulation cell proliferation GSCHWIND2004 . In mice genetic defect ErbB2 , ventricle fails undergo trabeculation CRONE 2002 ; mouse reduce expression HER-2 develop dilate cardiomyopathy . Approximately one quarter patient breast cancer increase expression HER-2 , associate poor prognosis include positive lymph node , decrease hormone receptor expression high proliferative rate . Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) monoclonal antibody extracellular domain HER-2 CARTER1992 approve treatment patient HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer 1990Â´s VOGEL 2002 . Later , trastuzumab approve use follow anthracycline-based chemotherapy decrease disease progression improve survival . The combination anthracyclines trastuzumab adjuvant setting reduce risk breast cancer relapse 50 % risk death breast cancer 33 % PICCARD 2005 und ROMOND 2005 . Despite proven therapeutic benefit , trastuzumab show cardiotoxic side effect 25 % treated patient , especially use combination doxorubicin . Approximately 5-10 % patient treat trastuzumab adjuvant set develop ( mostly asymptomatic ) cardiac dysfunction 1-3 % develop severe highly symptomatic heart failure NYHA functional class III - IV CHIEN 2006 . While early ( peak 4 month post chemotherapy ) late ( several year post exposure ) cardiac toxicity lead congestive heart failure describe following administration anthracycline-based chemotherapy , pathophysiology toxicity , particularly late phase remain incompletely understood several mechanism propose ; interruption HER-2 signal pathway heart seem affect ability cardiomyocytes grow , repair survive . Studies HER-2 knock-out mouse show dilated cardiomyopathy develops follow cardiac stress anthracycline administration OZCELIK 2002 . A direct toxic effect HER-2 blockade myocardial tissue level discuss , OZCELIK 2002 , trastuzumab seem block anti-apoptotic signaling pathway , lead cardiac dysfunction OZCELIK 2002 . An autopsy series cancer patient receive anthracyclines demonstrate 65 % patient clinical CHF microscopic evidence drug toxicity , 35 % 6 . It may difficult distinguish anthracycline cardiac toxicity ( ACT ) cause use currently available non-invasive modality 3 . The trastuzumab-induced left ventricular dysfunction seem reversible majority case , little know real-world effect anthracyclines trastuzumab cardiac function chemotherapy shortly . CMR non-invasive gold standard cardiac image assessment cardiac function also characterization myocardium use assessment acquire myocardial change myocarditis 7 non-ischemic cardiomyopathy . Pilot study show CMR detect even sub-clinical cardiotoxic effect patient anthracycline chemotherapy 8 . Our suggested study prospectively include patient first diagnosis breast cancer undergo potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy identify predictive value several CMR-derived identifier cardiotoxicity evaluate individually adjust follow-up cardiologist chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
