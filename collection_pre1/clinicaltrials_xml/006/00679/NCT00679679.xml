	<brief_title>Metformin Lifestyle Intervention Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common heterogeneous disorder woman reproductive age . It characterize hyperandrogenism chronic anovulation . Several study diverse population estimate 's prevalence 5-10 % . Women present , high percentage case , obesity , hirsutism , acne , menstrual irregularity infertility . Although exact physiopathology PCOS remain unknown , several study tend point insulinoresistance ( IR ) cause syndrome . IR present 60 70 % patient independently obesity . Compensatory hyperinsulinism pivotal role physiopathogenesis PCOS . In vitro , insulin stimulates androgen synthesis thecal cell decrease sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis liver , increase free androgen availability . Due high prevalence IR , PCOS share components metabolic syndrome : abdominal obesity , impair glucose tolerance , gestational type 2 diabetes , abnormality lipid profile , blood hypertension , endothelial dysfunction probably cardiovascular disease . In past , PCOS treatment focus ovulation induction infertility , oral contraceptive irregular bleeding , androgens antagonist hirsutism acne . In late year insulin sensitize agent use reduce hyperinsulinemia , improve ovary function associate metabolic abnormality . Metformin ( MTF ) , biguanide , usually use obese patient type 2 diabetes , inhibits glucose hepatic production , decrease insulin secretion increase peripheral insulin sensitivity . Some study report improvement insulin sensitivity associate reduction hyperandrogenism improvement reproductive abnormality MTF . On hand , author fail observe change . However , label indication usage PCOS FDA lack large control trial , MTF indication treat PCOS grow dramatically late year . In obese woman PCOS , weight loss effectively ameliorate hyperandrogenism metabolic disorder improve insulin resistance . Some trial suggest effect could improve insulin sensitize agent without change body weigh . The present study design assess , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled way , effect MTF addition lifestyle modification endocrine metabolic disturbance woman PCOS .</detailed_description>
