	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth breast cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab work treat woman HER2/neu-negative stage II stage III breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab Treating Women With HER2/Neu-Negative Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility administer two sequential chemotherapy doublet Avastin adjuvant setting . II . To assess safety Avastin adjuvant set particularly regard cardiac function , wound heal toxicity radiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect Avastin immunity , especially VEGF-A upregulation MDSC suppression T-Cells . II . To determine effect therapy number myeloid derive suppressor cell compare humoral cellular response p53 breast cancer patient treat chemotherapy . III . Patients follow freedom tumor progression survival . OUTLINE : COURSES 1-4 : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . COURSES 5-7 : Patients receive paclitaxel IV gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 pegfilgrastim SC day 1 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV day 1 course 5-7 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . COURSES 8-16 : Patients receive bevacizumab IV alone day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After course 8 , patient may undergo radiotherapy hormone therapy , clinically indicate . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
