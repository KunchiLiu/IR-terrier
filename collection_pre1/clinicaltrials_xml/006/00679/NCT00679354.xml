	<brief_title>Cilengitide Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent Progressive High-Grade Glioma That Has Not Responded Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate cilengitide young patient recurrent progressive high-grade glioma refractory standard therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate distribution time progression , time treatment failure , time death patient . II . To estimate rate toxicity , especially symptomatic intratumoral hemorrhage , patient . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics cilengitide plasma use limited sampling strategy . IV . To evaluate pharmacogenetic polymorphism drug transporter ( eg , breast cancer resistance protein [ BCRP ] , P-glycoprotein [ P-gp ] ) relate cilengitide disposition . OUTLINE : Patients receive cilengitide IV 1 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 , 25 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
