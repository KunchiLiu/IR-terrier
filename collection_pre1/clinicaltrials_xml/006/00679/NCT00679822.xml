	<brief_title>The Prevalence Risk Factors Sleep Disordered Breathing Heart Failure Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients systolic heart failure high prevalence SDB general middle age population [ 1-3 ] . There strong evidence treatment OSA general population reduces fatal non-fatal cardiovascular event [ 4 ] . In patient underlie heart failure OSA , treatment CPAP improve ejection fraction functional outcome [ 5 ] . In patient heart failure CSA , evidence increase sympathetic activity [ 6 ] , predisposition dsyrrythmia [ 7 ] increase mortality . However , date systematic diagnostic approach SDB vulnerable population part guideline management heart failure . In patient heart failure , prevalence Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) estimate 24-37 % Central Sleep Apnea ( CSA ) 40 % . The severity CSA show directly relate severity underlie heart failure [ 8 ] . Additionally , management heart failure change significantly since original study , include b-blockade , aggressive hemodynamic target , device therapy [ 9 ] . Taken together , observation call question applicability previous prevalence estimate CSA patient population . Indeed , recent data suggest decline incidence CSA [ 10 , 11 ] . Obstructive Sleep Apnea , hand , strongly associate obesity . The rise incidence obesity , strong association cardiovascular disease , may suggest rise incidence OSA patient population . Did recent change management heart failure change prevalence distribution SDB ? What effective approach diagnosis highly prevalent disorder vulnerable patient population ? A modern cost benefit analysis comparison current slow inefficient expensive approach need . An approach combine evaluation risk factor abbreviate portable study may adequate certainly less expensive . Our program aim provide every heart failure patient clinically indicate otherwise available screen SDB . Validated questionnaire screen ambulatory sleep study provide every patient . Additionally , clinical operation risk patient , rather significant benefit . The sensitivity specificity surveillance approach need evaluate validate . The validation operation bring additional benefit future patient . The accumulation analysis data also enable u determine magnitude sleep co-morbidity heart failure patient help educate clinician treat similar patient nationwide</detailed_description>
