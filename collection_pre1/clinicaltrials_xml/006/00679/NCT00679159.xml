	<detailed_description>M.tb intracellular organism protective immunity dependent intact cellular immune system . Both Class II-restricted CD4+ Class I-restricted CD8+ T lymphocytes important protection . Gamma delta cell non-classically restrict T cell CD1-restricted T cell may also play protective role knowledge induce protective level vaccination limit . Although several vaccine delivery system capable induce T cell , e.g . protein/adjuvant combination , DNA vaccines recombinant viral vector , use alone delivery system induce low-level response . Heterologous prime-boost immunisation strategy involve immunize 2 two different vaccine , express antigen , several week apart . These strategy induce high level CD4+ CD8+ T cell homologous boost animal model malaria , HIV TB . Recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara express antigen 85A ( MVA85A ) . When use heterologous prime-boost strategy , viral vector good boost previously prim T cell response , particularly recombinant adenoviral construct recombinant pox virus . Modified vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) attenuate strain vaccinia virus passaged 500 time chick embryo fibroblast consequence lose host range gene cytokine receptor gene . MVA excellent safety record , use vaccinate 120,000 people end smallpox eradication campaign , serious adverse event . In human , several hundred HIV negative volunteer immunize recombinant MVAs express number different antigen , serious adverse event . A recombinant MVA express antigen Plasmodium falciparum demonstrate boost CD4+ CD8+ T cell human . Recombinant MVAs clinical trial several infectious disease include HIV , hepatitis B malaria . Importantly , new TB vaccine , safety MVA viral vector demonstrate HIV positive patient . Including BCG heterologous prime-boost regime allow beneficial effect BCG retain . We develop immunisation strategy use BCG prim immunisation recombinant MVA ( rMVA ) boost . The antigen select inclusion rMVA must present strain BCG . We select Antigen 85A , form part immunodominant antigen 85 complex . Although numerous candidate antigen use TB vaccine , antigen 85A long consider leading choice . It major target antigen recognise T cell infected individual protective DNA vaccine small animal . Importantly , use BCG prime-MVA boost regime , highly conserve amongst mycobacterial specie present strain BCG . In small animal major target immune response induce BCG human HLA-A2 restrict CD8 T cell find high proportion BCG-immunised individual . Antigen 85A enzyme , mycolyl transferase , involve cell wall biosynthesis . Pre-clinical data Using BCG prime-MVA85A boost BALB/c mouse induces high level antigen specific interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) secrete CD4 T CD8+ T cell higher level protection BCG alone . This regime evaluate sensitive guinea pig aerosol challenge model encouraging result . Guinea pig vaccinate BCG , follow MVA85A , boost second recombinant viral vector , fowlpox , express antigen 85A ( FP85A ) show significantly great protection challenge guinea pig vaccinate BCG alone . This regime also immunogenic protective rhesus macaque Clinical study The safety immunogenicity BCG prime-MVA85A boost vaccination strategy evaluate series small-scale Phase I study UK . MVA85A first candidate TB vaccine clinical trial anywhere world September 2002 , currently one clinical trial Africa . The main immunological read-out use clinical trial ex-vivo IFN-γ Elispot assay , use ass specific T cell response tuberculin PPD , antigen 85 complex pool overlap peptide span length antigen 85A . The best immunological correlate protection murine human TB secretion IFN-γ sensitise T cell . In UK , 14 mycobacterially BCG naïve , healthy volunteer vaccinate 5 x 10^7pfu MVA85A , administer intradermally . We find MVA85A safe well tolerate . A single vaccination MVA85A induce remarkably high level specific effector T cell response ( median IFN- γ Elispot response Antigen 85A sum peptide pool 1153 spot per million PBMC ) . In addition , safety MVA85A volunteer previously vaccinate BCG demonstrate 17 volunteer . These 17 volunteer show even high peak level antigen specific T cell ( median response 2455 spot per million PBMC ) 1 week post-vaccination immunized MVA85A alone . Perhaps importantly induction T cell memory , volunteer previously BCG vaccinate maintain high level antigen specific T cell MVA85A 24 week vaccination , compare volunteer vaccinate MVA85A alone . In contrast viral vector boost , magnitude T cell response see vaccination lead protein/adjuvant vaccine ( malaria ) , RTS , S/AS02 , around 200 spot per million PBMC . This series Phase I study also replicate The Gambia , result The Gambia equally promise . In UK The Gambian study , MVA85A induce 5-10 fold high immune response recombinant MVA clinical trial . The likely explanation volunteer weak pre-existing anti-mycobacterial immunity induce exposure environmental mycobacteria , specific anti-mycobacterial immunity boost MVA85A . We preliminary data support hypothesis , group also find pre-existing immunity environmental mycobacteria healthy UK adult . Vaccines good boost previously prim T cell response , MVA85A , potentially good candidate post-exposure vaccine design boost immune response prevent development disease latently infect . If high level specific T cell see single immunisation MVA85A attributable boost pre-existing environmentally induced response , make MVA85A extremely promise candidate boosting vaccine , give post-exposure vaccine latent infection . The next study , complete enrolment UK February 2006 , assess safety immunogenicity MVA85A healthy volunteer latently infect M.tb . Twelve latently infect healthy subject vaccinate single dose 5 x 10^7pfu MVA85A . In study , latent M.tb infection determine tuberculin skin test ex-vivo IFN-γ Elispot responses two M.tb specific antigen , ESAT6 CFP10 . Follow-up involve detailed radiological clinical assessment safety vaccine M.tb infect subject . We find MVA85A equally safe equally immunogenic latently infect population population vaccinate BCG ( Sander et al , unpublished data ) . We also conduct dose finding study look two dos MVA85A , 1 x 10^7pfu 1 x 10^8 pfu . Twelve subject vaccinate dose . The preliminary result show vaccine significantly immunogenic high ( 1 x 10^8 pfu ) dose immunogenicity low ( 1 x 10^7 pfu ) dose comparable standard ( 5 x 10^7pfu ) dose . We start enrolment HIV study antiretroviral naïve , HIV infect adult CD4 count great 350 vaccinated MVA85A . To date , safety concern study . MVA85A trialled series Phase I II study Western Cape province , South Africa , prevalence tuberculosis extremely high ( annual incidence disease ~1 % ) . In August 2005 , enrolment commence trial 008 continue July 2006 . 24 healthy TB naïve HIV uninfected adult vaccinate . The preliminary result arm trial present Vienna ( Hawkridge et al , TB Vaccines World ; April 2006 ) Paris vaccine show safe highly immunogenic . Enrolment adolescent arm study commence November 2006 clear day 84 safety result adults satisfactory . This protocol form second part age de-escalation study South Africa , necessary commence Phase IIb proof-of-concept efficacy trial MVA85A population 2008 .</detailed_description>
