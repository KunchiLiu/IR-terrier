	<brief_summary>The objective trial examine long-term effect diet low carbohydrate , compare one low fat , cardiovascular disease risk factor , include blood pressure ( BP ) , body weight composition , serum lipid , plasma glucose , insulin , adipocytokines ( adiponectin , leptin , resistin ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) among obese adult . The investigator test follow hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : Compared low fat diet , diet low carbohydrate reduce systolic diastolic BP 12 month ; Hypothesis 2 : Compared low fat diet , diet low carbohydrate reduce body weight , total percent body fat , waist circumference 12 month ; Hypothesis 3 : Compared low fat diet , diet low carbohydrate reduce serum level LDL-cholesterol triglyceride increase serum level HDL-cholesterol 12 month ; Hypothesis 4 : Compared low fat diet , diet low carbohydrate reduce plasma level glucose insulin level 12 month ; Hypothesis 5 : Compared low fat diet , diet low carbohydrate reduce plasma level leptin , resistin , CRP increase plasma level adiponectin 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain leading cause death globally well United States . Manipulations macronutrient ( protein , carbohydrate fat ) content diet use extensively weight loss weight control past several decade . Low carbohydrate diet , particular , gained popularity weight loss . However , study examine effect diet low carbohydrate traditional novel cardiovascular risk factor long term , particularly contrast current dietary recommendation decrease fat intake reduce risk CVD . In proposal , plan conduct 12-month , parallel-arm , randomize control trial diet low carbohydrate versus currently recommend low fat diet reduce CVD risk factor among obese adult . The objective trial examine long-term effect diet low carbohydrate , compare one low fat , CVD risk factor , include blood pressure ( BP ) , body weight composition , serum lipid , plasma glucose , insulin , adipocytokines ( adiponectin , leptin , resistin ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) among obese adult . In order accomplish objective randomize 130 eligible participant ( n=65 group ) consume either diet low carbohydrate ( â‰¤40 g/d ) diet low fat ( &lt; 7 % saturate fat , &lt; 35 % total fat ) . Neither diet energy-restricted . Participants meet dietitian one-on-one counseling session weekly first 4 week , bi-monthly small group session next 5 month , monthly large group session final 6 month intervention . Data traditional novel CVD risk factor collect baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month . We hypothesize diet low carbohydrate compare diet low fat lower systolic diastolic BP , body weight , total percent body fat , waist circumference , serum level triglyceride , plasma level insulin , glucose , leptin , resistin , CRP , increase serum level HDL-cholesterol adiponectin . Because CVD common cause death U.S. world-wide , study important public health implication . It provide new information potential long-term effect diet low carbohydrate traditional risk factor CVD well novel risk factor inflammatory factor . The result study help determine diet low carbohydrate compare currently recommend low fat diet decrease risk CVD among obese adult .</detailed_description>
