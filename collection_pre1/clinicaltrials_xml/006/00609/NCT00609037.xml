	<brief_summary>The primary aim study test hypothesis wound heal impaired patient experience massive weight reduction follow gastric bypass morbid obesity . Specifically document post-surgical local complication evaluate multiple wound heal parameter two patient population prospective fashion . The test group consist patient undergone dramatic weight loss much need panniculectomy due excessive skin redundancy . The control group consist patient within normal weight range seek abdominoplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wound Repair Body Contouring Surgery After Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The morbidly obese patient successful weight reduction surgery represent poorly understood patient population present unique quandary . Prior gastric bypass surgery , many patient Type II diabetes , frequent skin infection poor hygiene , multiple medical co-morbidities . Fortunately , numerous problem resolve period rapid weight loss . Typically Type II diabetes come control without medication patient experience improvement mobility psychosocial adjustment . Unfortunately new dilemma rise vitamin deficiency due many month starvation , residual end glycosylation product diabetic skin massive skin redundancy multiple location . Excessive skin prone infection . Patients continue plagued postural problem , functional problem ( improper personal hygiene , continue difficulty ambulation ) psychosocial problem associate poor body image . Body contour provide patient mark improvement lifestyle . The post-bariatric patient population rapidly increase number , yet wound heal response accidental surgical trauma unreported literature . Recent study document clinical suspicion post-bariatric patient increase risk wound heal complication follow body contour procedure . The recent retrospective study 30 patient assess post-surgical outcome follow body contour procedure multiple body location note 20 % incidence wind breakdown 16 % incidence seroma ( 1 ) . An early retrospective study compare panniculectomy post bariatric patient receive simultaneous panniculectomy plus gastric bypass document wound infection ( 16 % ) , dehiscence ( 13 % ) skin necrosis ( 6 % ) post bariatric group ( 2 ) . A prospective study ten post-bariatric patient give circumferential abdominoplasty likewise experience wound complication : ( 33 % seromas , 16.6 % dehiscence , infection 8.2 % ) ( 3 ) . An 11 patient dermalipectomy series body contour bariatric surgery show 27 % incidence infection seroma ( 4 ) . To date , high rate wound heal complication report 46 55 ( 86 % ) dermolipectomy patient ( 5 ) . Taken together report provide clinical evidence wound heal impaired post-bariatric patient population . We prepare undertake quantitative evaluation wound repair characteristic select population . There multiple reason suspect skin may defective patient undergone massive weight reduction . A lifetime stretch skin thin density epidermal appendage peripheral nerve ending , alter vascular network , diminish elasticity alter weave collagen bundle reticular dermis . Such negative circumstance may impede delivery oxygen nutrient ultimately hinder tensile strength . Nutritional deficiency force starvation think decrease anabolic process impair inflammatory process , factor also govern time quality wound repair . Dehiscence rate could negatively impact synergy alteration . While post-bariatric patient electively seek body contouring surgery , certain ever increase number post-bariatric patient experience unexpected trauma non-elective surgical procedure - circumstance also challenge body repair . We maintain important document wound heal deficiency optimal treatment plan implement need arises .
