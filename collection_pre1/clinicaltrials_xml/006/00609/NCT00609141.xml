	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) child relapse refractory solid tumor use limited dose-escalation strategy . II . To define describe toxicity drug child relapse refractory solid tumor . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics drug child relapse refractory solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity drug child relapse refractory solid tumor within confines phase I study . II . To obtain initial phase II efficacy data antitumor activity drug child Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) . III . To examine change IGF-IR insulin receptor ( IR ) level IGF-IR IR activation lymphocytes biomarkers IMC-A12 action specificity . IV . To evaluate effect drug circulating level proteins involve linear growth glucose homeostasis , include IGF-I , IGF-II , IGF-BP3 , growth hormone , insulin , C-peptide . V. To develop exploratory data concern biomarkers activity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive cixutumumab IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2 year absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic , immunogenicity , correlative study . Samples analyze serum level IGF-I , IGF-II , IGF-BP3 , growth hormone , insulin , C-peptide ; trough concentration PK sampling ; biomarkers , include IGF-IR expression phosphorylation insulin receptor expression phosphorylation via immunoprecipitation Western immunoblotting . Tumor tissue sample patient Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET bank future research . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
