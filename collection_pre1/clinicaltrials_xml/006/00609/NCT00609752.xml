	<brief_title>Adverse Effects Glucocorticoid Therapy Bone Childhood Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's Disease serious inflammatory gut disorder often first present childhood . Once present , underlying condition remain life . It usually respond well medical treatment bring disease 'remission ' inclined become active interval ( relapse ) . When active , child unwell reduce energy , loss appetite distress abdominal symptom ( pain , diarrhea , etc. ) . Active disease treat two different way - either 3-month course steroid ( tablet ) , 6-week course call `` liquid diet therapy ( LDT ) . '' With LDT , child receive nutrition liquid form . Both treatment advantage disadvantage . Both quite effective , often control symptom within day . Steroids may cause various side effect include thin bone ( osteoporosis ) increase risk fracture . LDT somewhat challenge normal ( solid ) food allow period treatment . Both steroid LDT widely use - steroid predominately USA LDT elsewhere . There controversy best . This study aim determine prefer . In clinical study , child present Crohn 's disease randomly assign either steroid treatment LDT follow period one year . During time assign treatment use episode active disease . We study total 80 child attend Paediatric Gastroenterology Units Birmingham , Bristol , Liverpool , Oxford , Sheffield St. George 's Hospital London . Various outcome compare two group . We examine recovery rate ( success bring remission ) frequency subsequent relapse . We compare growth physical development , active Crohn 's disease possibly steroid may adverse effect process . A special focus study effect disease treatment bone health . Using special blood urine test bone scan compare bone growth density two group . Finally , crucially important consider impact disease treatment young person basis individual perspective . To compare 'quality life ' child two treatment group , use questionnaire specially design measure aspect young people Crohn 's disease . This study thus enable u undertake comprehensive comparison two major first-line treatment use childhood Crohn 's Disease . This crucially important , study previously undertaken</detailed_description>
