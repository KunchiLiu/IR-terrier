	<brief_summary>Despite extensive medical treatment , surgical resection require approximately 70 % patient time . However , recurrence disease operation occur majority patient serious limitation surgical management . Therapeutic option maintain postoperative clinical remission urgently need . Several drug include mesalazine , antibiotic ( metronidazole , ornidazole ) azathioprine 6-mercaptopurine studied past . But efficacy limited ( mesalazine ) , overshadow intolerability long-term therapy ( metronidazole , ornidazole ) inconclusive ( azathioprine 6-mercaptopurine ) . Research demonstrate absence inflammation patient divert ileostomy clinical benefit postoperative antibiotic therapy use metronidazole ornidazole implicates role resident bacterial flora postoperative relapse . Ciprofloxacin broad antibacterial spectrum . More interestingly also suppress E. coli strain , find high number early chronic ileal lesion Crohn 's disease patient Ciprofloxacin demonstrate beneficial effect therapy inflammatory bowel disease , available data effectiveness ciprofloxacin allow limit judgement safety tolerability 6 month therapy ciprofloxacin . Therefore exploratory multicenter prospective , placebo-controlled trial plan analyze safety tolerability 6 month therapy ciprofloxacin compare placebo 40 patient ( randomly assign 1:1 ratio ) undergo ileocecal resection ( resection part colon ) . If therapeutic regimen demonstrate tolerability , second large study improve superiority ciprofloxacin versus placebo initiate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite extensive medical treatment , surgical resection require approximately 70 % patient time . However , recurrence disease operation occur majority patient serious limitation surgical management . In set bacterial flora play important role demonstrate benefit postoperative antibiotic therapy either metronidazole ornidazole absence inflammation patient divert ileostomy . However , aforementioned antibiotic regimen numerous adverse event limit value therapy daily clinical practice . Ciprofloxacin suppress gram negative aerobic bacterial flora include E.coli strain , find early chronic ileal lesion Crohn 's disease patient . A limited number clinical data suggest efficacy drug patient establish Crohn 's disease . This exploratory multicenter prospective , placebo-controlled trial analyze safety tolerability 6 month therapy ciprofloxacin compare placebo 40 patient ( randomly assign 1:1 ratio ) undergo ileocecal resection ( resection part colon ) primary anastomosis . No treatment Crohn 's disease permit . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability 6 month therapy ciprofloxacin ( 500 mg bid ) vs. placebo tablet prevention endoscopic recurrence postoperative Crohn 's disease patient . The secondary objective study evaluate endoscopic recurrence neoterminal ileum ileocolonic anastomosis well extent colonic lesion . Additionally bioptic sample anastomotic site patient DNA sample collect later analysis bacterial ribosomal 19S RNA DNA polymorphism ( NOD2 IL-23 ) . The clinical data generate study serve basis definitive clinical trial investigate effectiveness ciprofloxacin prevention endoscopic recurrence postoperative Crohn 's disease .</detailed_description>
