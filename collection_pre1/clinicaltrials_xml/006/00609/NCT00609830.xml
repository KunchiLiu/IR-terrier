	<detailed_description>Therapy oral glucocorticoid often play important role management rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) Ad Hoc Committee Clinical Guidelines recently conclude glucocorticoid highly effective relieving symptom among people active RA medication may retard rate joint damage . Despite obvious benefit , therapy oral glucocorticoid well-established risk factor osteoporosis , highlight recently publish ACR Guidelines Prevention Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis . The ultimate objective propose research improve health-related quality life individual RA reduce risk develop osteoporosis secondary glucocorticoid therapy . The study four specific aim : ( 1 ) obtain descriptive information concern patient ' knowledge , beliefs behavior respect osteoporosis osteoporosis prevention ; ( 2 ) identify factor discriminate among patient different stage change respect behavior interest ; ( 3 ) compare effect tailor versus generic educational material patient adherence ACR Guidelines Prevention Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis ; ( 4 ) determine effect tailor educational material enhance concurrent feedback information concern patient ' behavioral risk factor status physician . A sample 273 patient RA currently take oral glucocorticoid recruit participate study . Data collect via mailed questionnaire telephone interview . The study use experimental research design . Following baseline data collection , participant randomly assign one four experimental group . Patients one group receive standard care . Patients second group receive generic educational material osteoporosis osteoporosis prevention addition standard care . Patients third group receive educational material tailor stage behavior change process addition standard care . Finally , patient fourth group receive tailored educational material care received patient third group . In addition , patient 's physician receive feedback concern patient 's status respect behavioral risk factor osteoporosis ( e.g. , inadequate calcium intake ) . Follow-up data collect one year baseline data collection . Variables assess include : ( 1 ) behavior , ( 2 ) stage change , ( 3 ) knowledge counsel receive concern osteoporosis , ( 4 ) health belief , ( 5 ) physical health status , ( 6 ) osteoporosis risk factor , ( 7 ) background characteristic , ( 8 ) information seek . To accomplish specific aim study , data analyze use descriptive statistic , multivariate analysis variance , discriminant analysis .</detailed_description>
