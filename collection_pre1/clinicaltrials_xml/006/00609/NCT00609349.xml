	<brief_summary>The early detection pulmonary arterial hypertension may help improve prognosis disease . It assume early stage pulmonary arterial hypertension , pulmonary arterial pressure value may normal rest , remodelling small artery lead stiffen result increased pulmonary arterial pressure exercise . In present study investigate patient risk factor pulmonary arterial hypertension ( e.g . connective tissue disease ) combine exercise tricuspid echo doppler cardiopulmonary exercise test screen patient exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension control result gold standard right heart catheterisation rest exercise . We expect use screen method , patient pulmonary arterial hypertension would recognize earlier .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Early Recognition Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) rare , life-threatening disease . It characterise elevation pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary vascular resistance . A remodelling small pulmonary vessel characterise proliferation adventitia , hypertrophy medium fibrosis intima observe microscopic level . According actual classification Venice ( 2003 ) , PAH idiopathic , familiar associate disease condition ( APAH ) . About 15 different clinical entity belong APAH group : connective tissue disease systemic sclerosis , mixed connective tissue disease , systemic lupus erythematodes among frequent . The development APAH diseases result decrease survival . Successful therapy include prostanoids , endothelin receptor antagonists phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor , however , effect associate condition appear small compare idiopathic PAH . The early recognition APAH may promote good treatment result prognosis . Hemodynamically , PAH define mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( MPAP ) &gt; 25mmHg rest , &gt; 30mmHg exercise . It assume early stage PAH , pulmonary arterial pressure value may normal rest , remodelling small artery lead stiffen result increased pulmonary arterial pressure exercise ( latent PAH ) . Doppler echocardiography , use tricuspid regurgitation jet simplify Bernoulli-equation , well establish clinical method estimation systolic pulmonary arterial pressure rest ( rSPAP ) . A close correlation rSPAP value echo right heart catheterisation ( RHC ) describe . A promising non-invasive method detect SPAP exercise Exercise Tricuspid Echo Doppler ( ETED ) . Previous study suggest , SPAP exercise assess ETED patient connective tissue disease , suggest considerable proportion patient suffer latent PAH . However , result study control gold standard RHC . According present guideline , RHC need definite diagnosis PAH , allow precise measurement MPAP , pulmonary arterial wedge pressure , right atrial pressure cardiac output , calculation pulmonary vascular resistance . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) reliable method objectively evaluate exercise capacity . Patients latent PAH may suffer dyspnea early fatigue exercise may reduce exercise capacity . A low peak O2 uptake associate poor prognosis patient PAH . In present study investigate patient risk factor PAH combine ETED CPET control result RHC rest exercise .</detailed_description>
