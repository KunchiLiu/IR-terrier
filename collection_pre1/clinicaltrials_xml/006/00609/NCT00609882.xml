	<brief_title>Comparison Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula Nasal CPAP Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory failure remain common problem neonatal ICU . Among premature infant respiratory failure use mechanical ventilation associate increased risk secondary lung injury subsequent development bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . As reported Avery et al Van Marter et al , early application nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) show effective non-invasive mode respiratory support population . ( 1 , 2 ) Additionally , premature sheep baboon model BPD , early use nCPAP accompany significant improvement subsequent lung development alveolization . ( 3 ) In light finding , concert effort NICU 's avoid prolong ventilator support early application nCPAP . Unfortunately , nCPAP system always easily apply tolerated preterm population . Difficulties application nCPAP include bulky head wrap , positional problem , compression nose , mark dilation tissue breakdown naris , apparent agitation , often lead use potentially neurotoxic medication . ( 4 ) Previous study suggest NC flow 1-2 lpm may also generate positive pressure airway preterm infant . ( 5 ) The use NC flow generate positive airway pressure would minimize many application issue nCPAP . However , standard NC system use neonate routinely employ gas inadequately warm humidify , limit use flow due increase risk nasal mucosa injury , possibly increase risk nosocomial infection . ( 4 , 6 ) The development humidify high flow via nasal cannula ( HHFNC ) system may obviate problem provide safe , effective alternative nCPAP preterm infant . Unfortunately , HHFNC allow measurement distending pressure without invasive process esophageal pressure catheter . Two recent report suggest HHFNC provide excessive distending pressure . ( 7 , 8 ) The study Saslow colleague find work breathing lung compliance improve preterm infant HHFNC maximum 5 lpm compare nCPAP 6 cm H2O . ( 7 ) In comparison nCPAP , maximum positive distending pressure measure 4.8 cm H2O significantly increase HHFNC flow 5 lpm . Kubicka colleague also demonstrate maximum distending pressure measure support HHFNC 8 lpm &lt; 5 cm H2O . ( 8 ) A recent publication suggest HHFNC safely effectively apply non-invasive respiratory management premature infant respiratory dysfunction . ( 9 ) In retrospective analysis evaluate 1000 infant , Shoemaker et al report significant decrease ventilator day among group infant manage HHFNC compare infant previously manage nCPAP . Additionally , find increased adverse effect note air leak , intraventricular hemorrhage , nosocomial infection BPD . In small prospective study , Campbell et al find benefit high-flow NC among group 40 infant &lt; 1250 gram . ( 10 ) However , use adequate humidification maximum `` high-flow '' apply &lt; 2 lpm . The previously note study Woodhead et al demonstrate HHFNC decrease respiratory work effort effective prevent reintubation high-flow standard , non-heated , non-humidified nasal cannula . ( 4 ) Thus HHFNC , flow rate high 8 lpm , use clinically large number NICU 's , include unit participate study , management variety neonatal respiratory problem . The introduction HHFNC clinical practice accompany apparent change neonatal outcome , systematically study randomize , control approach . The purpose randomize control trial evaluate clinical impact apply HHFNC nCPAP among group infant require continue non-invasive respiratory support NICU .</detailed_description>
