	<detailed_description>Photosensitive epilepsy form epilepsy consider genetic basis instance . It reflex type epilepsy . Patients condition exhibit epileptic activity pattern ( call photoparoxysmal response-PPR ) EEG intermittent photic stimulation certain flash frequency . Specific Aims 1 . To determine extent pharmacodynamic effect small change total free VPA concentration via constant infusion intravenous sodium valproate within photosensitive epilepsy patient . 2 . To determine change total free VPA concentration require achieve maximal effect PPR patient photosensitive epilepsy . Hypothesis 1 . Valproic acid ( VPA ) demonstrate differential pharmacodynamic effect PPR small change VPA concentration ( 5-20 mg/L change total , 0.5 2 mg/L change free VPA ) within patient . In essence , VPA concentration-response curve patient photosensitive epilepsy relatively steep . 2 . Intravenously-administered VPA demonstrate reduction standard photosensitive range ( SPR ) abolition PPR least 80 % patient study , entire range free VPA concentration consider . Photosensitivity , define PPR intermittent photic stimulation ( IPS ) , find approximately 5 % epileptic patient . Markedly photosensitive patient usually sensitive IPS within clearly define limit flash frequency ( mostly 10-30 Hz ) . This photosensitivity range , difference high low flash rate consistently elicit photoparoxysmal response ( PPR ) , use quantitative measure photosensitivity . Administration antiepileptic drug ( AEDS ) diminish even abolish PPR . With standard set test frequency , standard photosensitive range ( SPR ) use measure drug effect photosensitivity . Combined blood level monitoring , model offer information actual pharmacodynamic effect measure IPS related change blood level . The standardized IPS procedure include delivery short ( 5 second- ) train flash . The stimulation start low frequency ( usually produce PPR ) limit photosensitivity range ( threshold frequency patient show epileptiform EEG response ) . After stimulation start high frequency ( also produce PPR ) frequency produce definite PPR . The photic stimulator manually control stimulation order abort stimulation clear PPR elicit . With stimulation , simultaneous record EEG direct observation patient clinical change . With safety measure place , likelihood provoke prominent clinical seizure extremely low .</detailed_description>
