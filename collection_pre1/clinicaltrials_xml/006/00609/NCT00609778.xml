	<brief_title>A Comparison Conventional Adult Out-of-hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Against Concept With Mechanical Chest Compressions Simultaneous Defibrillation - LINC Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year 300 000 400 000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest outside hospital Europe . Only 5 - 7 % patient survive discharged hospital . In spite massive education , research new method survival rate improve . In late international guideline CPR , publish 2005 , strong emphasis chest compression little interruption possible . Manual chest compression CPR result 20-30 % normal blood flow difficult perform long period time . Mechanical chest compression LUCAS device show increase blood flow experimental study . Defibrillation ongoing mechanical compression new method treatment show promising result increase short time survival hospital cardiac arrest recently complete pilot study . The LINC trial prospective randomise multicenter study LUCAS accord concept use simultaneous defibrillation compare manual chest compression accord 2005 guideline advance CPR . The study conduct first tier system , LUCAS always place first arrive ambulance .</detailed_description>
