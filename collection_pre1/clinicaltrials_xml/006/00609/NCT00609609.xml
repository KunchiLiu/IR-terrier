	<brief_title>Photopheresis Treatment Acute Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECP use ultraviolet A radiation treat lymphocyte . Although exact reason ECP may beneficial completely understood , researcher believe lymphocyte treat way less likely continue cause GVHD . In study , researcher want evaluate whether add another treatment standard therapy corticosteroid , case ECP , improve response therapy , duration therapy , survival . After diagnosis acute GVHD , randomly select ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group . One group receive treatment corticosteroid ( like methylprednisolone prednisone ) alone , receive ECP treatment addition corticosteroid . ECP treatment explain . In order ECP , need special central venous catheter similar one . A central venous catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your physician explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Blood drawn machine call `` photopheresis machine '' . This blood go bowl inside machine , spun separate white cell ( call buffy coat ) , red cell , platelet . The red cell platelet promptly return , white cell buffy coat undergo process ECP . The buffy coat come bowl mixed substance call methoxsalen , make lymphocyte sensitive effect light . After mix methoxsalen , buffy coat go chamber exposed ultraviolet A radiation , back . This process do gradually , cycle , take 3 hour . You 4 treatment weekly first 14 day therapy , 3 treatment weekly Day 15-28 , 2 treatment weekly Day 60 , end study . After Day 60 , doctor decide whether ECP worth continue , also frequency treatment . It necessary study continue receive ECP treatment . If respond treatment , corticosteroid reduce slowly prevent GVHD come back . The length corticosteroid therapy depend GVHD respond treatment . You follow corticosteroid therapy tapering schedule accord suggest guideline . You continue receive tacrolimus cyclosporine , whichever use GVHD prevention , throughout study independent treatment group assign . While get treatment study , every week physical exam blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If doctor think necessary , blood may draw often . You consider off-study 6 month treatment completion . You take study unable comply study requirement , refuse continue participation study , intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . ECP approve FDA treatment certain type lymphoma skin commercially available . Its use patient GVHD consider investigational . Up 95 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must recipients allogeneic bone marrow stem cell graft . 2 . Patient must weigh 40 kg 3 . Patients must new onset , clinical grade IIIII acute lateacute GVHD GI tract liver , skin develop post transplantation . The diagnosis GVHD must pathologically confirm least one organ highly suspect clinically . Pathological confirmation may occur registration start therapy . Definition Late Acute GVHD v Acute GVHD : The diagnosis Late Acute GVHD include clinical feature identical Acute GVHD , however , Late Acute GVHD diagnose day 100 post transplantation . 4 . Continued # 3 : These manifestation include maculopapular rash , abnormal liver study ( cholestatic jaundice ) and/or nausea/vomiting / diarrhea . Patients must concurrent classical feature chronic GVHD addition manifestation . Features chronic GVHD include dry eye mouth , contracture , and/ sclerodermal , lichenoid skin change . 5 . In clinical judgment PI , patient must able sustain platelet count hematocrit &gt; /= 20,000/mL &gt; /= 27 % respectively , without transfusion . 6 . The absolute white blood cell count ( WBC ) must &gt; 1500/mL 7 . Patient must willing comply study procedure . 8 . All patient childbearing potential , include male female , must commit use adequate contraceptive precaution throughout participation study 3 month follow last ECP treatment . 1 . Patients develop chronic GVHD follow immune modulation immunosuppression withdrawal donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . 2 . Any clinical Manifestation consistent de novo chronic GVHD overlap syndrome acute chronic GVHD . 3 . Patients unable tolerate volume shift associate ECP treatment due presence follow condition : uncompensated congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , severe asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , hepatorenal syndrome . 4 . Active bleed 5. International normalized ration ( INR ) &gt; 2 6 . Patients receive methylprednisolone &gt; 2mg/kg/day 72 hour prior registration . 7 . Patients receive immunosuppression treatment GVHD calcineurin inhibitor corticosteroid . Patients allow GVHD prophylaxis exception ECP 8 . Patients know hypersensitivity allergy psoralen 9 . Patients know hypersensitivity allergy citrate heparin 10 . Patients coexist photosensitive disease ( e.g . porphyria , systemic lupus erythematosus , albinism ) coagulation disorder . 11 . Uncontrolled , persistent hypertriglyceridemia , level &gt; 800 mg %</criteria>
