	<brief_summary>The long-term goal proposal understand impact obesity obesity treatment bone health adolescence preserve . The recent pediatric obesity epidemic raise important clinical public health question effect childhood-onset obesity treatment bone health . Osteoporotic fracture major cause morbidity mortality age , peak bone mass ( PBM ) , achieve shortly puberty , key determinant bone strength lifetime fracture risk . Given current obesity epidemic , obesity treatment adolescence continue necessary . The benefit pediatric obesity treatment unquestionable . However , potential detrimental effect weight loss bone density dimension know adolescent focus proposal . This study focus impact pediatric-onset obesity treatment bone health , use two approach : compare obese non-obese adolescent compare obese adolescent weight loss . We hypothesize ( ) compare non-obese control , obese adolescent strong bone , ( b ) bone strength obese adolescent decrease weight loss compare usual care , would suggest need promote bone health successful weight loss obese adolescent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Health Obese Adolescents During Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context : The childhood obesity epidemic raise important clinical public health question effect obesity obesity treatment bone development . Osteoporotic fracture major cause morbidity mortality age . However , peak bone mass , achieve shortly puberty , key determinant lifetime osteoporotic fracture risk . The size direction effect obesity weight loss bone health childhood unclear , partly bone ascertainment issue . Obese child adolescent may elevate fracture risk , contrary expectation base adult data . Objectives : Primary aim propose study : 1 ) characterize compare bone health obese non-obese adolescent use accurate method available , 2 ) investigate impact comprehensive behavior weight control program bone health obese adolescent . Study Design : Aim 1 use case-control design compare bone status measure 88 obese adolescent ( age 10 14 year ) , recruit randomized obesity treatment trial , measurements 51 contemporary non-obese control adolescent . For Aim 2 , 88 obese adolescent enrol 12-month randomized trial , 1:1 assignment , comprehensive behavioral weight control program vs. individualized nutrition education ( usual care ) . This randomized trial object registration . Study Measures : For aim primary outcome bone strength , estimate stress-strength index , measure peripheral quantitative computerize tomography ( pQCT ) tibia , weight-bearing site .</detailed_description>
