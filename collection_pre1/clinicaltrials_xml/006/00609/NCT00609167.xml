	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy cyclophosphamide dexamethasone work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cyclophosphamide dexamethasone together bortezomib may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study give cyclophosphamide dexamethasone together bortezomib see well work treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary * To evaluate response rate ( complete response [ CR ] , near CR [ nCR ] , good partial response ) patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma treat bortezomib combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone . Secondary - Determine overall response rate ( partial response , PR , good ) patient 4 , 8 , 12 course regimen . - Determine duration progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - To evaluate toxicity regimen patient . - To evaluate ability successfully collect peripheral blood stem cell patient 4 month regimen . - To evaluate CR nCR rate patient 8 12 course regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 OR day 1 , 8 , 15 22 ; dexamethasone day 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 course 1 2 day 1 , 18 , 15 , 22 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
