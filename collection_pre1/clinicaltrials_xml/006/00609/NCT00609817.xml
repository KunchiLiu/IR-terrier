	<brief_summary>A Phase 1 , open-label , dose escalation , multi-center study patient diagnose multiple myeloma relapse refractory/relapsed disease treatment least 2 prior therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study GCS-100LE Treatment Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate safety dose-limiting toxicity GCS-100 subject relapse relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma , identify maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend dose study . The secondary objective study ( ) evaluate safety treatment GCS-100 combination bortezomib ( VelcadeTM ) subject whose disease progress GCS-100 alone ; ( ii ) evaluate response GCS-100 alone , combination bortezomib subject whose disease progress GCS-100 alone , dexamethasone therapy combination GCS 100 plus bortezomib subject whose disease progress GCS-100 plus bortezomib ; ( iii ) evaluate utility potential surrogate marker ; ( iv ) perform exploratory correlative analysis bone marrow sample define good mechanisms action response therapy .</detailed_description>
