	<criteria>Type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis least 1 year Administration insulin glargine least 2 month prior screen ; subject must stable dose insulin glargine , + 15 % , least 1 week prior screening , give daily bedtime , dose must remain unchanged ( + 15 % ) screening period . If subject take shortacting insulin ( e.g. , regular human insulin , insulin lispro , insulin aspart ) oral antidiabetic agent ( e.g. , sulfonylurea , metformin , alphaglucosidase inhibitor , thiazolidinedione , metiglinide ) , subject must receive medication least 2 month prior screen . For subject take oral antidiabetic agent , dose must unchanged 2 week ( 4 week thiazolidinedione ) prior screen expect change screen visit ( day 14 ) final visit ( day 11 ) . The dose shortacting insulin may change medically indicate . Males nonpregnant female age 6 75 year ; woman must postmenopausal 2 year , surgically sterile , agree use reliable contraceptive measure duration study . Reliable contraceptive measure include follow : systemic contraceptive ( oral , implant , injection ) , diaphragm intravaginal spermicide , cervical cap , intrauterine device , condom spermicide . Ability willingness perform blood glucose profile use plasma glucose meter provide home 11 consecutive day . HbA1c &lt; = 8.5 % screening . Use intermediate longacting insulin ( e.g. , NPH , Ultralenter , Lenter ) within last 2 month prior screen . Likelihood require treatment study period drug permit study protocol ( e.g. , systemic corticosteroid ) . History hypoglycemia unawareness . Pregnancy ( determine serum pregnancy test screen visit ) . Breastfeeding . Treatment investigational drug 2 month prior screen visit . Clinically relevant cardiovascular , hepatic , neurologic , endocrine , major systemic disease make implementation protocol interpretation study result difficult . History drug alcohol abuse . Impaired hepatic function , show limited serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase ( SGPT , also know alanine transaminase [ ALT ] ) serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ( SGOT , also know aspartate transaminase [ AST ] ) 2x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) measure screen visit . Impaired renal function , show , limited serum creatinine &gt; = 1.5 mg/dL ( 133 micromol/L ) [ male ] &gt; = to1.4 mg/dL ( 124 micromol/L ) [ female ] measure screening visit . Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study . Subject unlikely comply protocol , e.g. , uncooperative attitude , inability return followup visit , unlikelihood completing study . Subjects work night shift .</criteria>
