	<brief_summary>The usefulness diagnostic vitrectomy patient suspect sarcoidosis posterior segment involvement ( diagnosis determine conventional method ) well describe . We hypothesize diagnostic vitrectomy would help establish diagnosis challenge case . Herein , evaluate diagnostic yield vitreous biopsy patient suspect sarcoidosis-associated uveitis affect posterior segment.This retrospective interventional case series . Cases intermediate , posterior panuveitis could characterize clinical examination , ancillary , laboratory test consider diagnostic par plana vitrectomy . Retrospective chart review conduct consecutive eye underwent diagnostic , diagnostic therapeutic vitrectomy single surgeon January 1989 June 2006 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Yield Vitreous Biopsy Sarcoid Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We obtain approval conduct non-comparative , interventional , retrospective case series Duke University Institutional Review Board . We use establish database patient uveitis operative report single surgeon ( GJJ ) identify consecutive patient underwent diagnostic par plana vitrectomy January 1989 June 2006 . We exclude patient acute postoperative traumatic endophthalmitis study . Cases include intraocular vitreous specimen obtain diagnostic testing . After identify 150 patient , review medical record individual previously describe . Patient demographic data clinical history record time initial visit . A complete ophthalmic history examination perform single examiner ( GJJ ) . The examination include slit-lamp biomicroscopy dilate fundus examination indirect ophthalmoscopy . Anterior segment inflammation grade use system describe Hogan colleague . The system previously describe Nussenblatt et.al . use grade vitreous opacity . Fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography , ultrasonography perform indicate . A differential diagnosis compile case , base clinic finding . Additional laboratory test order depend constellation clinical history , exam finding , result previous ancillary testing . Anti-inflammatory therapy initiate empiric diagnosis-specific manner , clinical response follow carefully . Diagnostic vitrectomy perform eye intermediate , posterior , panuveitis etiology could characterize clinical examination , laboratory , and/or ancillary testing . In addition , diagnostic vitrectomy perform eye adequately respond empirical therapy , intraocular malignancy infection suspect . Therapeutic vitrectomy perform conjunction diagnostic vitrectomy clinically indicate , example repair retinal detachment , remove epiretinal membrane , decrease vitreous opacity , insert intraocular sustain drug-delivery implant . In study , vitreous sample collect operating room use standardized technique previously report . Briefly , three-port , 20-gauge par plana vitrectomy instrumentation utilize . An infusion line insert one sclerotomy secure globe . A second sclerotomy make , fiberoptic light pipe immediately insert minimize vitreous egress . A third sclerotomy create , vitreous cutter insert . To obtain undiluted vitreous sample , vitreous cut mechanically vitreous cutter , assistant surgeon simultaneously manually aspirate vitreous . The tip vitreous cutter view time wide-field view system procedure . After sufficient undiluted sample obtain , infusion fluid allow enter eye dilute vitreous sample obtain similar manner . The sample personally carry clinical laboratory operate surgeon . Vitreous fluid analysis guide clinical suspicion base pre-operative differential diagnosis intraoperative posterior segment appearance . Cytopathology use identify granulomatous inflammation tumor cell . A thin-prep prepared , processed membrane filter apparatus ( Millipore Corp , Bedford , MA ) stain Papanicolaou stain . Gram stain , KOH preparation culture use diagnose intraocular infection . Where appropriate , instruction give clinical laboratory specific sample processing ( e.g. , suspect slow-growing bacterium , Propionibacterium acnes suspect fungal infection ) . Genomic amplification polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) perform University Colorado ( Boulder , CO ) , Texas Children 's Hospital ( Houston , TX ) test presence Herpes simplex virus , Herpes zoster virus , cytomegalovirus . PCR perform Toxoplasma gondii Palo Alto Medical Foundation ( Palo Alto , CA ) previously describe . Toxocara canis antibody level detect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) Centers Disease Control Prevention ( Atlanta , GA ) . For Toxoplasma gondii Toxocara canis , simultaneous serum sample also collect sent respective laboratory . The final diagnosis base upon result direct diagnostic test vitreous sample . A positive diagnostic vitrectomy result base upon identification specific etiologic agent test modality previously describe . Sarcoidosis diagnosis exclusion without know etiologic agent . There definitive laboratory test unequivocally confirm diagnosis sarcoid . Therefore , diagnostic specimen deem positive sarcoid-related inflammation follow criterion satisfy : 1 ) vitreous test negative 2 ) clinical feature sarcoidosis include differential diagnosis base pre-operative clinical appearance , 3 ) cytopathology specimen consistent pattern sarcoid-related inflammation non-caseating granuloma formation , establish cytopathologist .</detailed_description>
