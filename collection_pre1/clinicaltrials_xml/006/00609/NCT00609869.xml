	<brief_summary>The purpose research evaluate use Rituximab combination Revlimid treatment refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL ) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . Revlimid® drug change immune system may also get way growth tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Revlimid® approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type Myelodysplasia syndrome ( MDS ) Multiple Myeloma , two different type blood cancer . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Comb w/Rituximab Pts w/CD5+/CD20+ Hem Malignancies Who Relapse/Progress After Rituximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial use Simon 's two stage design enrol total 28 subject . Ten accrued stage 1 18 stage 2 . If 3 few response ( CR+PR ) observe first stage trial stop early . Given 'true ' response probability 30 % , 64.96 % probability end trial stage 1 . However , 'true ' response probability 60 % 5.48 % probability trial stop stage 1 . If 3 response observe stage 1 , another 18 patient accrue stage 2 . If 12 few response observe end trial , investigation drug warrant . Otherwise , conclude drug worthy investigation . The alpha level design 0.04 power 0.91 . Patients confirm CD5+/CD20+ MCL CLL relapse progressed Rituximab therapy follow minimum 6 month duration response ( SD , PR , CR define Appendix D ) eligible study . Baseline evaluation patient prior enrollment study include complete blood count ( CBCs ) , serum chemistry , liver function test , kidney function test , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ; CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis ; bone marrow biopsy . The exact value status organ function allowable protocol include body document . Bone marrow aspirate , biopsy standard FISH evaluation specific cytogenetic abnormality obtain clinical site . An adequate bone marrow aspirate sample require subject eligible participate study . All assessment complete accord Schedule Study Assessments . Patients meet eligibility criterion sign informed consent laboratory evaluation involve flow cytometry peripheral blood evaluate : 1 ) CD20 density leukemic cell ( CLL patient ) , 2 ) percentage CD56+ cell evaluate baseline level natural killer ( NK ) cell , 3 ) density activation antigen ( CD2 , CD11a , CD31 , CD38 , CD69 ) CD56+ cell , 4 ) CD38 ( ZAP-70 ) expression . Pretreatment serum baseline value Interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) , Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-A ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , IL-6 , soluble IL-2 receptor obtain . A baseline CBC , flow cytometry cytokine study obtain Day 1 prior start Lenalidomide . All patient full immunological evaluation Day 15 Lenalidomide therapy prior Rituximab administration . A bone marrow biopsy perform patient ( CLL MCL ) prior document bone marrow involvement Days 13- 15 assess impact lenalidomide malignant cell surface density CD20 patient CLL administration Rituximab . Flow cytometry aspirate specimen perform Moffitt Cancer Center . The cytokine study draw Day 15 , prior administration Rituximab . Starting Day 15 collection specimen , patient receive four weekly dos Rituximab ( 375 mg/m^2 ) concurrent lenalidomide per cycle schedule . Lenalidomide therapy continue progression disease , unacceptable toxicity patient withdrawal . Patient assessment clinical trial perform physician occur prior administration dose Rituximab . The evaluation include CBC , routine chemistry , kidney function , liver function , LDH . The impact treatment lymphadenopathy splenomegaly document . Any toxicity note evaluation note . After four weekly dos Rituximab , pretreatment bone marrow biopsy positive , patient repeat bone marrow biopsy ass response . If patient splenomegaly lymphadenopathy prior entry trial , patient need repeat CT scan assess response . The scan bone marrow biopsy perform two week patient 's last dose Rituximab . Follow-up patient complete Rituximab treatment patient progress therapy involve CBC , routine chemistry , liver function test , LDH draw accord Schedule Assessments .</detailed_description>
