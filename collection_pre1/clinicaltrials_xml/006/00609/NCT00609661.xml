	<brief_summary>This study design determine response adult stem cell , also refer mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) , tissue injury result thermal burn . The study consist one time collection patient 's blood , one teaspoon , third day follow initial burn . MSCs blood quantitated identified use accord unique protein find cell surface use flow cytometry . The result flow cytometry analysis compare patient characteristic ( age , sex , race , etc . ) , past medical history ( hx diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , etc . ) patient outcome ( length hospital stay , mortality , etc . ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traumatic non-traumatic disease process result vary tissue injury culminate organ failure death . Current literature demonstrate adult stem cell ( ASCs ) mobilize peripheral circulation heterogeneous population cell follow tissue injury . The significance heterogeneity yet define . Other study show ASCs augment tissue repair appropriate condition . This proposal begin elucidate mechanism ASC activation , mobilization localization sit injury . This study use flow cytometry identify subset ASCs mobilize response tissue injury compare response patient 's demographic , comorbidities , hospital morbidity , mortality . Patients thermal burn use model tissue injury give quantity tissue injure robust signal generate injury . ASCs currently investigate adjunct tissue repair involve host tissue , include cardiac , neural , renal . The identification specific subset ASCs selectively mobilize response tissue injury would alter study involve ASCs tissue repair necessitate identification target subset selectively mobilize response injury particular tissue .</detailed_description>
