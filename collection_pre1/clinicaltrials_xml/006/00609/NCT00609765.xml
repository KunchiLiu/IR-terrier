	<brief_summary>Open label , single-arm phase II study avastin combine fluorouracil , doxorubicin streptozocin administer 28-day cycle . Treatment continue progression disease , withdrawal due toxicity , maximum 12 cycle ( 48 week ) . In order reduce risk cardiac toxicity , doxorubicin administer maximum 8 cycle . If disease progress 12 cycle treatment , avastin monotherapy continue disease progression withdrawal due toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients need come 24 study visit . Most study visit take 2 hour . At study visit , doctor - Will physical exam - Will take blood routine lab test - Will urinalysis - Will administer study medication Some study visit may longer patient CT scan MRI . At patient 's last visit , CT scan MRI . After treatment start , patient : - Have blood pressure monitor every dose Avastin® ( every 2 week ) . - Have history physical every chemotherapy cycle ( every 4 week ) . - Have blood take routine blood test every chemotherapy cycle ( every 4 week ) . - Have CT scan MRI every cycle ( every 8 week ) . - Have MUGA scan every 4 cycle ( 16 week ) . - Have blood take tumor marker every cycle marker high baseline . - Patients receive study medication treat cancer : - Fluorouracil day 1 5 cycle cycle 12 - Doxorubicin day 1 cycle cycle 8 - Streptozocin day 1 5 cycle cycle 12 - Avastin® day 1 15 cycle cycle 12</detailed_description>
