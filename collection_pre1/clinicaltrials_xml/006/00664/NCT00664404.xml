	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To evaluate neural correlate associate emotional processing nicotine withdrawal preferentially involve amygdala associate area within corticolimbic mesolimbic circuitry . We hypothesize relative pre-quit baseline , post-quit nicotine withdrawal result increase activity negative emotional cue , contrast cue , one area interest , particularly right cerebral hemisphere . - To determine bupropion varenicline moderate pattern brain activation post-quit nicotine withdrawal . We hypothesize relative placebo , bupropion varenicline attenuate effect post-quit nicotine withdrawal emotional processing , reduce activation negative emotional cue , relative cue , one area interest , particularly right cerebral hemisphere . - To determine genotype ( DRD2 TaqA2 allele in variant -141C ins/del DRD2 ) moderate pattern brain activation post-quit nicotine withdrawal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before begin participation study , ask provide name address 3 contact ( family member/friends ) know current contact information . This study researcher stay contact throughout study . This case study researcher may need reach order reschedule appointment time . You also ask sign letter give contact permission provide contact information study staff . If staff able reach , may try locate telephone directory assistance internet . If study staff still unable locate , may use locator service , Transunion National Change Address ( NCOA ) database , maintain United States Postal Service . If agree take part study , ask come Behavioral Science Research Clinic M. D. Anderson 2 laboratory session . One session smoking , one session abstinent smoking ( smoke ) . At session , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) brain look slide . fMRI involve scanner use large magnet , instead x-rays , take picture inside body . The slide include picture people , nature scene , artwork , victim car crash , medical procedure ( open surgery autopsy ) , nude people . You show example slide fMRI , give opportunity withdraw study time . If choose continue study , fMRI take brain . This involve pass narrow tube-shaped scanner open end . During fMRI , brain electrical activity monitor . The total time lab session last 1.5 hour . You drink 2 cup coffee caffeine drink least 2 1/2 hour session . This caffeine may affect brain functioning . Before one session , may ask smoke bedtime day session session next day . Before one session , may ask smoke would regularly . Additionally , may ask smoke one laboratory session . At lab session , ask blow air carbon monoxide ( CO ) measuring device . CO gas found ( high level ) body cigarette smoker . You also ask question smoke habit ; health medical condition ; medication take . You also ask complete questionnaire ask mood feeling . You may ask complete questionnaire , , fMRI . At end study , able ask question result study procedure experience study . Your participation part study last 2 week . It end last lab session . You still consider participant main study ( Protocol 2003-1024 ) may additional visit , questionnaire , activity complete . This investigational study . Up 72 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject must participant 'Pharmacogenetics , Emotional Reactivity &amp; Smoking ' ( protocol 20031024 ) . 2 . Both parent must European descent . The sample limited individual European descent majority publish work gene interest limit racial group . This do mostly prevent population stratification genetic study , since allele frequency difference often exist among group differ continent origin . 3 . Right hand . The sample limit right hand individual since analyze neuroimaging data lateralization effect inclusion participant mixed handedness could confound result . 4 . Age : 18 year old 1 . Contraindications MR imaging procedure ( e.g. , subject certain type implant medical device , pacemaker , neurostimulators , etc. , subject claustrophobic ) .</criteria>
