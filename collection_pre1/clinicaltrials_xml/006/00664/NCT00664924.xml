	<detailed_description>BRYTECH STUDY SUMMARY The Remote Physiological Monitoring System ( RPM™ ) wireless technology physiological monitoring . The RPM™ design capture , transmit remotely monitor vital sign patient group patient . The RPM™ allow patient carry unobtrusive unit sensor array , able store and/or forward data via exist communication network . This data archivable make available monitoring station station . This approach obviate need provide new expensive infrastructure support system since design 'piggy-back ' exist network . A major clinical advantage RPM™ principal reason may offer benefit patient , provide continuous remote monitoring vital sign , contrast current situation ward patient , intermittent vital sign monitoring . This major advantage patient hospital staff , since increase evidence demonstrate early recognition treatment clinical event , e.g. , shock , save life ; concurrent cost labour save obvious benefit . The RPM™ use wireless technology overcome portability problem associate conventional patient monitoring system . The RPM™ use shelf computer technology standard display , well secure , wireless , 802.11 networking protocol consist follow system component : 1 . Physiological Monitoring Unit ( PMU ) 2 . Data Aggregation Server ( DAS ) 3 . Clinical Monitoring Position ( CMP ) To validate RPM™ device regulatory approval , BRYTECH evaluate RPM™ clinical setting , thereby ensure system trustworthy acceptable health professional monitor system patient . The study propose evaluate accuracy reliability RPM™ compare monitor commonly use medical practice standard condition medical practice ; study therefore non-intervention study . The study also propose evaluate notification alarm system , communication interface non-interference exist system , device , network procedure well incremental nursing workload associate integration RPM™ clinical environment . The RPM™ reference physiological monitoring device compare physiological monitoring capability 40 patient follow four ( 4 ) cohort : 1 . Cohort 1 ( Exercise ) : patient schedule undergo minimum 20 minute exercise test . 2 . Cohort 2 ( ICU ) : patient admit Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) 3 . Cohort 3 ( Post-op ) : patient Post-Operative care 4 . Cohort 4 ( ER ) : patient admit Emergency Room ( e.g. , high risk medical admission ) These cohort consider representative broad spectrum general patient population . Patients participate study assign one 4 cohort , minimum 10 patient assign Cohort 1 ( Exercise ) minimum 5 patient cohort . For study , RPM™ reference monitoring device time-stamped zero time readily evaluable patient fit necessary sensor collection vital sign , namely heart rate ( HR ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood oxygen saturation level ( SpO2 ) , non-invasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) , body temperature ( BT ) respiration rate ( RR ) . For Cohort 1 ( Exercise ) patient , comparative monitoring vital sign do exercise test minimum 20 minute additional monitoring perform pre- post-exercise . There minimum 10 patient cohort . For patient Cohorts 2 , 3 4 , comparative monitoring vital sign perform period ( 24 - 72 hour ) require collect 12 Vital Sign Assessment Cycles ( VSAC - define Section 5.2.2 ) per subject , minimum 5 patient cohort total 30 patient . The four cohort patient choose allow comparison vital sign RPM™ standard nursing measurement technique broad range physiologic data ( e.g . rest exercise ) patient population ( e.g . stable critically ill ) .The primary objective study determine substantial equivalence RPM™ reference device standard practice measurement compare agreement ( accuracy ) pair output result individual vital sign reliability data collection 24 hour monitoring period . Timepoint match pair data available timepoints collect RPM™ reference device , exclude ambulatory data , heart rate , ECG , SpO2 , blood pressure , body temperature respiration rate . Accuracy determine assess whether paired value show significant agreement . Reliability determine comparison cumulative total lose data point error rate . The study conduct accord Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline patient required sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . This non-intervention study patient test subject use RPM™ experimental procedure trial . Importantly , patient expose significant risk result participate study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The informed consent document must read , sign , date patient ( legally authorize representative ) , individual obtain consent , witness appropriate , conduct study related procedure examination . 2 . Patients ≥18 year age old , race either sex . Women pregnant may participate study . 3 . The RPM™ must interfere patient care . 4 . Investigator Study Staff must able clearly access site attach sensor . Specific Inclusion Criteria Cohort 1 ( Exercise ) : Patients refer StageI preoperative exercise test ass fitness surgery . Patients history chronic respiratory cardiac condition result symptoms exertion . Specific Inclusion Criteria Cohort 2 ( ICU ) : � Patients admit ICU life support whose hospital stay expect 72 hour . Specific Inclusion Criteria Cohort 3 ( Postop ) : Patients undergo surgery postoperative recovery expect 72 hour . A broad variety patient history coronary heart disease , congestive heart failure chronic lung disease , consider high risk cardiopulmonary complication ; patient undergo major thoracic surgery high risk cardiopulmonary complication . Specific Inclusion Criteria Cohort 4 ( ER ) : � Patients admit general medical ward ER whose hospital stay expect 72 hour . 1 . Patients history medical condition would preclude completion study , e.g. , patient whose skin disorder excessive weight interfere proper function standard monitoring . 2 . Patients significant unstable disease could compromise study assessment and/or participation study . 3 . The PI Medical Monitor may declare patient ineligible valid medical reason patient 's condition patient 's action may inappropriate inclusion study design . Specific Exclusion Criteria Cohort 1 ( Exercise ) : Patients would tolerate standard exercise test patient severe peripheral vascular disease , disable arthritis neurological condition ; Patients significant change symptom since referral ( e.g. , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ) . Specific Exclusion Criteria Cohort 2 ( ICU ) , 3 , &amp; 4 : Patients severely agitate ; Patients increase monitoring may interfere provision clinical care ; Patients family attend team commit provide necessary aggressive supportive care ; Patients consider brain dead ; Patients standard sensor capture unstable patient severe peripheral vascular disease saturation probe function properly .</criteria>
