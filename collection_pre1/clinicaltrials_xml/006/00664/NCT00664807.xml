	<brief_title>Medtronic Genetic Arrhythmia Markers Early Detection ( GAME Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective establish role genetics life-threatening arrhythmias lead sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) potential utility genetic marker risk stratification patient receive implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) . The successful accomplishment goal would serve basis future work specific diagnostic test use ass risk threaten arrhythmias order quality patient implantation ICD . - identify single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) use identify individual need ICD . The secondary objective involve detailed analysis search potentially unidentified genetic marker risk SCD . 1. identify gene associate SCD susceptibility . 2. identify risk factor associate SCD find case report form ( CRF ) . 3. correlate SNPs co-morbidities subject find CRF information . 4. study association parameter derive Holter recording predictor life-threatening arrhythmia .</detailed_description>
