	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Because success advance NSCLC single agent combination chemotherapeutics , reasonable investigate efficacy toxicity docetaxel multimodality regimen patient population . Docetaxel dose 20 mg/m2 appear well-tolerated `` weekly '' dose combine either cisplatin 25 mg/m2 20-22 carboplatin area curve ( AUC ) 2 23-25 concomitant radiation therapy . PURPOSE : To explore potential benefit radiosensitizing effect weekly docetaxel/carboplatin/radio therapy concurrent therapy follow full dose systemic docetaxel/carboplatin consolidation therapy overall response rate , survival , progression-free survival , safety toxicity patient locally advanced NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine overall survival ( 0S ) advance NSCLC patient receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy weekly docetaxel , carboplatin radiation therapy follow two cycle consolidation chemotherapy docetaxel carboplatin . Secondary - To determine overall response rate patient treat regimen . - To determine time disease progression patient treat regimen . - To assess safety tolerability regimen patient . OUTLINE : - This Phase II , open label , multi-center study determine overall survival rate patient treat concurrent chemoradiotherapy weekly docetaxel , carboplatin radiation follow two cycle consolidation chemotherapy docetaxel carboplatin . Eligible patient receive concurrent therapy docetaxel ( 20 mg/m2 ) administer weekly seven week 30-minute intra-venous ( IV ) infusion follow carboplatin ( AUC 2 ) administer weekly seven week 30-minute IV infusion . Concurrent radiation therapy administer dose 1.8 Gy daily 5 days/week 25 fraction follow dose 2.0 Gy daily , 5 days/week 9 fraction ( total 34 fraction ) . There three-week rest period follow end concurrent chemotherapy consolidation phase begin . During phase study , patient treat docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 ) administer 1-hour IV infusion follow carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) administer 30-minute IV infusion . Patient treat every three week total two cycle .</detailed_description>
