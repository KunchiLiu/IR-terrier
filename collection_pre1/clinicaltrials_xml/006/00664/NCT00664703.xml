This study evaluate effectiveness lobeline improve adult ADHD symptom , specifically inattention , impulsivity , memory problem . This study also evaluate side effect lobeline treatment . Participation study last 4 5 week , participant attend 10 study visit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . Participants first undergo medical evaluation visit include physical exam , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood draw , urine testing , breath sampling . Participants return orientation visit complete questionnaire receive train computer memory task perform later visit . The next 7 visit comprise laboratory test medication treatment portion study . Each visit last 4.5 hour include urine breath sampling , computer memory task , questionnaire , vital sign measurement , medication distribution . Participants randomly assign take two different pill lab visit . One pill placebo lobeline methylphenidate , medication stimulant use treat ADHD , pill active lobeline methylphenidate . Drug combination dos vary day , participant never receive two active pill day . All participant undergo follow-up evaluation 7 14 day final lab visit . The evaluation include question side effect study medication , breath urine sampling , blood draw , physical exam .</detailed_description>
