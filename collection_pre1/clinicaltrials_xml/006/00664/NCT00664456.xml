	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist may lessen amount androgen make body . Internal radiation use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Giving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist together iodine I 125 implant may effective treatment patient prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well give luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy together iodine I 125 implant work without additional luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy treat patient previously untreated prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate biochemical progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival , clinical PFS , disease-free survival patient previously untreated intermediate-risk prostate cancer treat neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist therapy permanent iodine I 125 implantation v without adjuvant LHRH agonist therapy . - To determine non-adaptive interval salvage therapy patient treat regimen . - To determine safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist therapy 3 month undergo permanent iodine I 125 implantation . Patients receive adjuvant LHRH agonist therapy 9 month . - Arm II : Patients receive neoadjuvant LHRH agonist therapy undergo permanent iodine I 125 implantation arm I .</detailed_description>
