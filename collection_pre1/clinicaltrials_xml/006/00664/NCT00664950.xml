	<brief_title>InterTAN IM Nail Versus Sliding Hip Screw Geriatric Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outcome hip fracture elderly generally poor . According World Health Organization , fracture hip associate 20 % 1-year mortality 50 % loss function33 . However , high mortality loss function improve . For example , numerous study show improvement relevant outcomes intervention improve thromboprophylaxis , care pathway timely surgery achieve . Up 50 % decrease mortality achieve interventions1,2,3 . While improvement perioperative care improve outcome , benefit new surgical technique implant less clear . This well demonstrated case intertrochanteric fracture . Intertrochanteric fracture primary fracture line occur great less trochanter include approximately 50 % hip fracture . Many surgical implant develop common fracture pattern ; general , conventional implant slide hip screw ( SHS ) plate fix lateral cortex femur , distal fracture ; large-diameter screw place centre femoral head , proximal fracture . The screw plate slide relative one another , permit compression fracture facilitate bone healing . In contrast , new implant typically intramedullary nail design ( IMN ) , metal nail place within canal femur large-diameter screw place centre femoral head . The theoretical advantage newer design base upon , first , improve stability implant , allow earlier aggressive mobilization ; second , less invasive surgical procedure minimize blood loss . Nonetheless , repeat trial meta-analyses fail demonstrate advantage IMN design compare SHS . In fact , perioperative complication seem high use IMN designs4,5 . There two primary reason IMN design translate improved result date . First , perioperative complication , especially fracture femur , common current IMN design . Second , suppose improved stability confer device may actually achieve . Current IMN design retain original concept single screw femoral head , prevent rotation femoral head - common reason implant failure . As well , current IMN design permit unrestricted axial shortening femur , may lead significant leg length change alter gait . A new implant design take advantage inherent theoretical strength IMN design improve upon current design flaw . The InterTAN device ( IT ) design improve stability fixation intertrochanteric fracture . This device double proximal hip screw , achieve rotational control ; improve implant geometry , improve immediate stability ; immediate compression achieve stability avoid uncontrolled leg length change . The IT device retain percutaneous insertion technique IMN device simplifies insertion redesign instrumentation . The InterTAN device first device design specifically provide enhanced stability intertrochanteric fracture seem offer significant promise compare IM design . The InterTAN device , yet , compare conventional surgical technique . According Cochrane Database Reviews , `` Any new design evaluate randomised comparison slide hip screw .
