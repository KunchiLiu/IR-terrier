	<brief_summary>This component build directly upon result previously fund project systematically investigating impact short-term ovarian hormone fluctuation female try quit smoking aid either transdermal nicotine patch ( TNP ) varenicline . Each participant receive standardize impulsivity evaluation laboratory-based cue reactivity assessment initiation smoke cessation . Progesterone estrogen level measure nine visit , thereby provide index reproductive hormone variation course participant 's quit attempt . This novel approach integrate human laboratory cue reactivity paradigm directly treatment outcome study permit u ass whether smoke cue reactivity predictive utility respect cessation outcome . Subjects randomize receive one two active pharmacotherapeutic intervention smoke cessation : TNP vs. varenicline randomize , single-blind , double dummy design . While TNP demonstrate modest efficacy improve smoke cessation outcome , evidence efficacy may robust men compare woman . This project provide important information ) impact ovarian hormone level smoke cessation outcome , b ) relationship smoke cue reactivity smoke cessation , c ) comparison new pharmacotherapeutic agent TNP woman .</brief_summary>
