	<detailed_description>The primary aim project study closely role play post-release aftercare outcomes criminal offender receive in-prison substance abuse treatment . Prison-based therapeutic community ( TC ) ( Pelissier et al. , 2001 ; Wexler , 1995 ) demonstrate efficacy , especially combine post-release TC aftercare ( Melnick et al. , 2001 ) . For example , Inciardi et al . ( 2003 ) show TC aftercare substantially reduce criminal behavior significantly decrease illicit drug use compare outcome inmate drop prison TC care graduate prison TC , enter remain long TC aftercare . Moreover , release TC participant may prefer feel ready less-structured environment TC aftercare . Several important question relevant public health issue remain unclear scientific literature regard prison TC aftercare . The answer might help establish enlighten post-release aftercare policy affect prison inmate . For example , unclear whether main therapeutic effect TC aftercare TC substance abuse treatment supportive residential setting . Typically , TC aftercare outcomes prison TC graduate compare aftercare-as-usual , range across wide variety intervention . Few comparison group include residential setting emphasize socialization abstinence drug alcohol - hallmark TC aftercare setting . This study propose compare relative effectiveness TC aftercare aftercare alternative provide supportive living environment without professional treatment TC aftercare . Oxford Houses ( OH ) provide , like TCs , residential post-release set emphasizes socialization abstinence drug alcohol , include formal therapeutic change intervention common TCs , include on-site access drug abuse health care professional . Such comparison possibly clarify value add TC aftercare intervention process present OHs . The aim project important public health perspective may treatment matching , case management , financing factor could manipulate enhance cost-effectiveness community-based substance abuse treatment offender leave prison . It possible TC OH aftercare modality increase abstinence social support , self-efficacy , employment , mediate reduction drug use , reincarceration , health problem , overall benefit likely great TCs employ professional service empirically base behavioral strategy . However , OHs might advantage compare traditional post-incarceration modality ( e.g. , low cost ) . Bringing scientific method examination TCs OH community-based recovery model addiction might help identify `` active ingredient '' recovery setting . The propose study utilize ex-offenders randomly assign either TCs , OHs , usual care post-release setting , examine program effect ( i.e. , substance use , criminal health outcome ) , economic factor associate model . A research find study contrast different approach potential influence practice inform policy . Several theoretically base hypothesis include : TCs OHs comparison usual aftercare less substance use , less criminal recidivism , good health outcome . TCs expect well outcome OHs measure , due professionally structured inpatient nature TC . Factors related program ( i.e. , abstinence social support , self-efficacy , employment ) mediate differential outcome . For example , due inpatient nature TCs requirement employment remain OH , OH resident expect employment earnings first year . However , difference expect converge 18 24 month . Usual aftercare reflect low employment earn relative TC OH time period . The long term post release outcomes moderate gender , ethnicity , substance abuse ( i.e. , severity typology ) , in-prison treatment ( i.e. , prison TC fidelity , day prison TC ) . Although outcomes overall expect best TC , follow OH usual aftercare , expect cost-benefit ratio favorable OH , follow TC , low cost benefit ratio usual aftercare .</detailed_description>
