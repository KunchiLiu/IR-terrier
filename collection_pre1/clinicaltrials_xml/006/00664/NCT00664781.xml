	<brief_title>Rucaparib ( CO-338 ; Formally Called AG-014699 PF-0136738 ) Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assessment Anti tumour activity PARP-1 inhibitor rucaparib patient locally advance metastatic breast advance ovarian cancer show express BRCA 1 2 mutation . - To evaluate toxicity treatment Rucaparib population 's . Secondary - To evaluate time progression overall survival patient treated drug . - To study pharmacokinetics drug patient population . - To evaluate Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) activity peripheral blood lymphocyte BRCA 1 2 heterozygotic patient . - To determine tolerable effective dose regimen Rucaparib oral formulation . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study follow open label multicenter study . The study originally set IV formulation . An oral formulation PARP-1 inhibitor rucaparib use . Patients stratify accord tumor type ( breast v ovarian ) mutation status ( BRCA 1 v BRCA 2 ) . In addition , patient high-grade serous ovarian cancer enrol Stage 1 study . All patient enrol receive PARP-1 inhibitor rucaparib oral formulation daily either 7 , 14 , 21 day cycle , ( two possible dosage 21 day treatment ) . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable respond disease may receive additional course treatment discretion chief investigator Drug Development Office ( DDO ) . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . Samples analyze tumor marker ( CA 125 and/or CA 15.3 ) measurement , rucaparib plasma level via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry , PARP activity , PARP protein expression via western blotting immunoassay . Paraffin embed section original diagnostic biopsy also collect analyzed PARP protein expression via immunohistochemical technique . Pleural ascitic fluid may collect analyzed DNA DS break repair proficiency via immunohistochemical technique . Some patient also undergo biopsy tumor sample analyze BRCA 2 mutation well PARP activity via validate PARP immunoblotting assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . All stage study ( IV oral ) : Patients must prove known carrier mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 consider highly likely carrier BRCA1 2 mutation* ( score ≥ 20 per Manchester criterion ) histologically document locally advanced metastatic breast cancer advance ovarian cancer . *Patients consider highly likely carrier test consent BRCA1 2 mutation must confirm patient eligible receive treatment . Oral stage 1 : In addition , patient high grade serous ovarian cancer unknown BRCA status may enter oral stage 1 . 2 . Patients ovarian cancer ( include epithelial , fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal cancer ) 5 prior chemotherapy regimen last 5 year . For BRCA carrier &gt; 2 month must elapse since last treatment carboplatin cisplatincontaining regimen high grade serous ovarian cancer patient ≥ 6 month . 3 . Patients breast cancer 5 prior chemotherapy regimen last 5 year . 4 . Measurable disease measure Xray , computerise tomography ( CT ) , MRI scan define RECIST criterion . These measurement must do within 4 week patient go study . Clinical measurement must do within one week patient go study . Patients bone disease must measurable disease evaluation . Previously irradiated lesion use measurable disease . 5 . Life expectancy least 12 week 6 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 0 1 ( Appendix 1 ) 7 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within one week patient go study . Lab Test Value Required Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥9.0 g/dl Neutrophils ≥1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ( Plts ) ≥100 x 10^9/L Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper normal limit Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) unless due tumour case 5 x ULN permissible Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) calculate either Wright formula ≥50 ml/min CockcroftGault formula isotope clearance measurement 8 . 18 year 9 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy , biological agent investigational agent previous 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas MitomycinC ) treatment . 2 . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment . Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , opinion Investigator Drug Development Office ( DDO ) exclude patient . 3 . Known brain metastasis . 4 . Female patient able become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral , injected implant hormonal contraception condom , intrauterine device condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel condom , surgically sterilise ) 4 week enter trial , trial 6 month afterwards consider eligible . 5 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree use one form highly effective contraception barrier method condom plus spermicide trial 6 month afterwards ) . 6 . Major thoracic and/or abdominal surgery precede 4 week patient recover . 7 . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 8 . Concurrent malignancy site , exception adequately treat conebiopsied situ carcinoma cervix uteri basal squamous cell carcinoma skin concurrent breast ovarian carcinoma . Cancer survivor , undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , eligible study . 9 . Patients active unstable cardiac disease history myocardial infarction within 6 month . Patients cardiovascular sign symptom MUGA scan echocardiogram , patient leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) institutional limit normal exclude . 10 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial . 11 . Patients already receive PARP inhibitor .</criteria>
