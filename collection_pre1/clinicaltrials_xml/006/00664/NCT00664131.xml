	<brief_title>Neurologic Morbidity Disability Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) prevalent childhood malignant disease . Survival improve 5-10 % early 1960s 80 % present . Historically , central nervous system ( CNS ) common site leukemia relapse . However , major improvement cure rate achieve addition CNS direct therapy use initially craniospinal irradiation , recently , combination high-dose systemic methotrexate intrathecal chemotherapy . ALL mostly afflict child first 12-years life , age progressive myelination take place central nervous system vulnerable chemical radiologic injury . Many ALL study report neurologic adverse event related treatment . Little known long-term outcome neurologic toxicity develop treatment leukemia , development new late onset neurologic complication . No data available outcome non-behavioral/cognitive neurologic complication , seizure , incoordination , headache , loss motor sensory function , impaired energy muscle weakness . In addition , data available impact neurologic disability quality life ALL survivor . It important understand recognize neurologic disability , cause impact function quality life adequate timely remedy offer education appropriate intervention undertake help prevent long-term morbidity . This prospective observational study ALL St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital survivor determine prevalence different headache syndrome , define International Society Headache criterion ( IHS ) prevalence severity seizures relationship leukemia treatment . We establish incidence , type , severity , disability sensory-motor neuropathy present long term progression initial peripheral nerve injury ALL survivor . This study also help define whether high incidence low back pain relation specific treatment . Subjects one-time evaluation investigator administer questionnaire neurologic examination .</detailed_description>
