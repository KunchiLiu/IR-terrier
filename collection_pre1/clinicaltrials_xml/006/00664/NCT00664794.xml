	<brief_summary>Surgical repair full-thickness tear rotator cuff controversial issue , several procedure currently use treat tear . The two common treatment point time arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty . However , arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty may offer degree improvement one include acromioplasty , without threaten shoulder stability provide acromion coracoacromial ligament . This prospective study examines hypothesis appropriate shoulder function restore execution traditional arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotator Cuff Repair With Arthroscopic Acromioplasty ( Shaving Acromion Bone ) Versus Repair Without Acromioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rotator cuff musculotendinous amalgamation four muscle arise scapula insert proximal humerus . The tendon supraspinatus , infraspinatus , subscapularis , teres minor form continuous cuff around humeral head allow variety movement rotation humeral head . Tears one tendon comprise rotator cuff one many cause pain disability shoulder12 . Treatment tear include operative non-operative approach . The non-operative approach generally include modification activity , administration analgesic anti-inflammatory medication , progressive physiotherapy program aim regain full range motion shoulder full strength rotator cuff . The result stem treatment part disappoint 13 . Codman16 first describe open surgical technique rotator cuff repair Neer17 later refine exist surgical technique addition first apply acromioplasty repair tear rotator cuff . Since time , operative repair full-thickness tear rotator cuff gradually shift open repair arthroscopic repair combine open/arthroscopic ( mini-open ) procedure perform . The mini-open procedure involve arthroscopic evaluation glenohumeral joint arthroscopic acromioplasty couple open repair cuff tear15 . As surgeon gain experience mini-open repair , begin familiarize arthroscopic appearance rotator cuff tear improve ability arthroscopically measure tear ass repairability4 . These advance combine improvement arthroscopic instrument suture technique allow elimination open portion mini-open repair emergence completely arthroscopic procedure . Exclusive arthroscopic repair rotator cuff tear provide advantage deltoid preservation , less soft tissue dissection , shorten hospital stay , accelerate rehabilitation . It also allow visualization glenohumeral joint , advantageous since several author report 60-75 % incidence coincide glenohumeral pathology cuff tears5,6 . There exist controversy current trend repair full-thickness tear rotator cuff . The two common treatment point time arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty . The purpose acromioplasty create adequate space rotator cuff tendon . Arthroscopic acromioplasty involves removal subacromial bursa , resection coracoacromial ligament anteroinferior portion acromion , resection osteophyte acromioclavicular joint thought contribute impingement . However , acromioplasty without cuff repair report good9,10 poor11,14 result , show technique may suspect repair full-thickness tear alone . Budoff colleague suggest since coracoacromial ligament stabilizes rotator cuff prevent uncontrolled migration humeral head , resection coracoacromial ligament arthroscopic acromioplasty may cause additional long-term migration humeral head7 . Likewise , Nirschl suggest coracoacromial ligament resect case specific pathological indication relate coracoacromial ligament8 . He also state , `` evidence support belief failure resect coracoacromial ligament compromise success rotator cuff surgery . ''</detailed_description>
