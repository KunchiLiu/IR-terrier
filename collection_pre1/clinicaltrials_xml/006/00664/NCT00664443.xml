	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiac arrest lead cause mortality Canada , overall survival rate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rarely exceed 5 % . Survivors quality life similar general population . While bystander CPR increase survival cardiac arrest victim four time , bystander CPR rate remain low Canada ( 15 % ) . Many Canadian urban community offer 9-1-1 dispatch-assisted CPR instruction caller report victim cardiac arrest . Some evidence suggest agonal breathing misinterpret sign life Dispatch Officers , result inappropriate withhold dispatch-assisted CPR instruction . Dispatch-assisted CPR instruction recommend International Guidelines Emergency Cardiovascular Care , ability improve cardiac arrest survival remain unclear accord systematic review literature . Objectives : The overall goal study well understand factor lead successful dispatch-assisted CPR instruction ultimately save life cardiac arrest patient . Specific objective : 1 ) Determine ability 9-1-1 dispatcher make diagnosis cardiac arrest phone ; 2 ) Quantify frequency impact perceive agonal breathing cardiac arrest diagnosis ; 3 ) Measure frequency dispatch-assisted CPR instruction successfully complete out-of-hospital cardiac arrest case ; 4 ) Measure impact dispatch-assisted CPR instruction bystander CPR survival rate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . Methods : We conduct before-after , prospective cohort study evaluate 9-1-1 call report out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victim . The study take place 19 urban community Ontario provide dispatch-assisted CPR instruction since April 1st 2004 . The study population include 9-1-1 caller report out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation attempt patient 16-years old . The dispatch center protocol consist establish nature emergency initiate appropriate level response ; include ask standardize question determine cardiac arrest present . The Dispatch Officer offer CPR instruction telephone emergency response vehicle way location . Standardized data collection tool use extract information : 9-1-1 call recording , paramedic patient care report , base hospital record , fire medical record , hospital medical record . All participate center already combine information various source cardiac arrest registry . The following information collect : confirmation cardiac arrest status Dispatch Officer , presence apparent agonal breathing , CPR instruction offer 9-1-1 caller , factor influence ability 9-1-1 caller perform CPR include proximity victim 's location emotional receptiveness instruction , time interval call 9-1-1 initiation CPR bystander . Measurements include accuracy cardiac arrest diagnosis , frequency perceive agonal breathing cardiac arrest , 9-1-1 caller 's ability receive instruction initiate CPR , bystander CPR rate , survival hospital discharge . Data analysis Objective # 1 include sensitivity , specificity receiver operate characteristic curve ; Objectives # 2 # 3 analyzed use descriptive statistic ; Objective # 4 univariate , stepwise logistic regression , time series analysis perform control trends time variable otherwise associate bystander CPR survival rate 6000 arrest victim .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient outofhospital cardiac arrest ( absence detectable pulse , unresponsiveness , apnea ) : Of presumed cardiac origin ; Occurring study community ; For resuscitation attempt bystander and/or emergency responder ; dispatchassisted CPR instruction provide . The following patient exclude : Patients young 16 year ; Patients `` obviously dead '' define Ambulance Act Ontario ( decomposition , rigor mortis , decapitation , ) ; Trauma victim , include hang burn ; Patients cardiac arrest clearly noncardiac origin include drug overdose , carbon monoxide poisoning , drown , exsanguination , electrocution , asphyxia , hypoxia related respiratory disease , cerebrovascular accident document terminal illness .</criteria>
