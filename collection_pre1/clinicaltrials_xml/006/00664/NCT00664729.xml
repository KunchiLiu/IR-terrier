	<brief_summary>Reductions fat oxidation rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) associate normal age accelerated menopause . As result , postmenopausal woman increase risk abdominal obesity ultimately metabolic complication lead insulin resistance syndrome associate risk ( hyperlipidemia , type 2 diabetes , coronary heart disease ) . Thus , need determine successful treatment reduce visceral obesity postmenopausal woman . The purpose study determine dietary-induced weight loss alone and/or weight loss combine exercise low high- intensity differentially affect reduction visceral adipose tissue postmenopausal woman abdominal obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Overview : This study 's protocol last approximately 18 month . Phase 1 involve recruitment screen follow baseline research testing ( Phase 2 ) . Next , subject randomly assign one three 5-month treatment ( Phase 3 ) : diet high-intensity exercise , diet low-intensity exercise , diet . In Maintenance Phase , subject return visit 6 &amp; 12 month follow completion 5 month intervention . Interventions : All treatment group experience total weekly caloric deficit ( -2800 kcal/wk ) , derive deficit different reduction dietary intake exercise energy expenditure . The weekly caloric deficit accomplish follow : 1 ) diet alone group reduce dietary intake ~2800 kcal/week ( ~400 kcal/day ) ; 2 ) exercise group expend ~400 kcal/wk exercise energy expenditure reduce dietary intake ~2400 kcal/wk ( ~340 kcal/day ) achieve 2800 kcal/wk deficit . The exercise take place exercise facility Geriatric Research Center campus Wake Forest University/Baptist Medical Center . Two study personnel , include least one trained technician , supervise exercise session . Emergency equipment keep site exercise session . Blood pressure heart rate measure record exercise session participant warm-up walk 3-5 min slow pace . Women use treadmill exercise intensity 45-50 % ( low-intensity AEX ) 70-75 % ( high-intensity AEX ) VO2max . Both group exercise 3 d/wk duration exercise progress 10-15 min 1st week 55 min end 6th week thereafter low-intensity AEX group . The duration exercise high-intensity AEX group progress 10-15 min 1st week 30 min end 6th week thereafter . Injuries minimize feasible progression exercise duration well careful monitor proper footwear stretching exercise . The diet intervention consist monthly meeting register dietitian along consume hypocaloric diet provide GCRC metabolic kitchen . Subjects ask pick food three time week . Two meal per day provide . In addition , calcium supplement ( 1000mg ) provide . Subjects require keep diary food consume include calcium supplement . The diet compose 50-60 % carbohydrate , 15-20 % protein , 25-30 % fat adequate amount essential nutrient . The number calorie give subject estimate energy expenditure estimate combination activity factor . The diet group provide approximate 400 kcal/day energy deficit diet , exercise group provide approximate 340 kcal/day energy deficit diet . Menus specific food choice determine GCRC dietitian consultation research subject .</detailed_description>
