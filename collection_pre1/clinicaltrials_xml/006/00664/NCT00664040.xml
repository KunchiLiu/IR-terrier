	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death United States many people die heart disease previous symptom . This study look specifically response four short-term environmental exposure include : body 's response cold stimulus , high fat milk shake , aspirin , high low salt diet . These intervention know influence CVD people different response intervention , may due , least part , differences genetic make .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heredity Phenotype Intervention ( HAPI ) Heart Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly one million Americans die CVD 1999 , predict , one million Americans myocardial infarction ( MI ) 650,000 experience first MI . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause mortality U.S. , account 1 every 5 death , 680,000 2,000,000 death . CAD also lead cause premature , permanent disability U.S. labor force , account $ 110 billion health care cost annually , compare $ 329 billion CVD . Risk factor CAD include high blood pressure , tobacco smoke , abnormal lipid lipoprotein , physical inactivity , overweight obesity , diabetes mellitus , increase age , male sex , heredity , individual response stress , menopause woman . Other indicator increase risk event include presence extent coronary artery calcification , endothelial dysfunction , platelet aggregation . Of die suddenly CAD , 50 % men 63 % woman previous symptom . Studies specific environmental intervention may interact gene influence select risk factor , especially individual vary extent vascular calcification , marker atherosclerosis , facilitate early identification asymptomatic high-risk individual benefit exist new intervention . The overall objective proposal identify novel locus ( ultimately gene ) interact specific environmental exposure modify risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . To achieve goal , perform four short-term intervention know modify CVD risk participant Amish Family Calcification Study ( AFCS ) , ongoing study joint genetic determinant CVD osteoporosis . Over 1,000 individual ongoing study already recruit characterized respect CVD risk factor , include blood pressure , body composition , lipid , coronary artery calcification ( electron beam computerize tomography ( EBCT ) ) . From previous examination , DNA collect AFCS subject 5-cM genome scan ( ~800 short tandem repeat ( STR ) marker ) complete NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Service . Thus , large family study unique genetically homogeneous founder population provide ideal opportunity identify gene interact environment shape risk factor CVD . The Specific Aims proposal : 1 . To perform four focused short-term intervention know affect cardiovascular function 1,000 subject AFCS . Responses relevant CVD-related quantitative trait measure . The intervention response : a. cold pressor stress change blood pressure change endothelial function assess brachial artery dilation ( BART ) ; b. high fat load change brachial artery flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) serum lipid level ; c. high salt low salt diet change blood pressure ; d. aspirin change platelet function inflammatory marker . 2 . To characterize genetic epidemiology response short-term intervention : a. estimate heritability response intervention ; b. determine response intervention correlate coronary artery aortic calcification , association explain common gene share environment ; c. determine response intervention correlate baseline measure CVD risk factor , , association explain common gene share environment . 3 . To identify specific chromosomal loci influence CVD-related trait response four short-term intervention perform genome-wide linkage analysis utilize 5 cM density ( ~800 STR marker ) genetic map already available 1,000 subject AFCS . 4 . To determine chromosomal region link , associate , variation CVD-related trait response also link , associate , variation coronary artery aortic calcification . 5 . To fine map putative chromosomal locus link variation CVD-related trait response short-term environmental intervention linkage disequilibrium mapping closely space single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) marker .</detailed_description>
