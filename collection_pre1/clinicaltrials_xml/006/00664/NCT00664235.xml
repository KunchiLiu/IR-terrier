	<brief_title>The Analysis Skin Temperature Long Wave Infrared Imaging Determine Its Effectiveness Predictor Tissue Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Trillennium Medical Imaging system use gather skin temperature data 100 subject . The subject enrol Duke North floor 8100 8300 prospective control trial . All eligible patient sign consent form assess use Long Wave Infrared imaging . Subjects eligible study sign consent form scan bilateral heel sacrum . Subjects ulcers area also scan due fact high risk develop additional pressure ulcer . The intent capture image exist ulcer , focus area could potentially develop additional pressure ulcer . The subject already ulcer scan non ulcerated tissue . The area interest must off-loaded 3 minute pressure order acclimate ambient temperature . The device hold approximately 36 inch area interest order obtain image . The subject assess within 24 hour admission every 24 hour discharge develop pressure ulcer . The subject 's routinely record Braden score ( By floor nursing staff ) also capture order effectively compare effectiveness Imaging system . The nurse conducting imaging also record Braden score . All subject include trial unless refuse participate incapacitate degree image becomes unreasonable .</detailed_description>
