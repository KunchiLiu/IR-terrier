	<brief_title>Juvidex ( Mannose-6-Phosphate ) Accelerating Healing Split Thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Split thickness skin graft transplantation patient 's cutaneous tissue harvest area normal skin , replace area skin loss injury . The split thickness skin graft ( SSG ) one commonly perform operation plastic reconstructive surgery1 . Indications split skin graft include : reconstruction surgical removal cutaneous malignancy , replace tissue lose full-thickness burn cover chronic non-healing cutaneous ulcer . As grafting procedure , donor site wound create , , case SSGs , wind partial-thickness wound heals re-epithelialisation . Often , graft donor site slow heal , source postoperative discomfort . In patient sustained major burn affect large percentage cutaneous surface area , early closure burn wound autologous skin graft limit lack adequate donor site . These donor site may need re-harvested provide skin cover ; however delay 2 3 week often require allow site heal prior re-harvesting . A treatment accelerate heal SSG donor site produce harvest would address area high medical need , provide area available re-harvest , also reduce potential associate morbidity patient include pain infection . This could also reduce length hospital stay associate reduce healthcare cost . Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) , naturally occur protein play central role wound heal response . Juvidex develop Renovo therapeutic agent administer accelerate heal acute wound . The propose mechanism action antagonistic involves inhibit activation TGF-beta 1 TGF beta 2 . Using healthy volunteer ideal way study heal process split thickness skin graft donor site since donor site create exactly anatomically match . These match pair use compare drug placebo . The trial undertaken ass effect intradermally inject topically apply Juvidex heal small skin graft donor sit volunteer subject . The trial also compare effect placebo treatment standard care alone heal donor site . This enable placebo effect accurately measure allow accurate assessment actual drug effect .</detailed_description>
