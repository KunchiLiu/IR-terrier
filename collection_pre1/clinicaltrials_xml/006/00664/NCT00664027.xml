	<brief_title>Phase IIa Trial Determine Effects Bardoxolone Methyl Renal Function Patients With Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bardoxolone methyl Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator clinical development inflammation cancer-related indication inhibit immune-mediated inflammation restore redox homeostasis inflame tissue . It induce cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 suppress activity pro-oxidant pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB STATs . In vivo , bardoxolone demonstrate significant single agent anti-inflammatory activity several animal model inflammation renal damage cisplatin model ischemia-reperfusion model acute renal injury . In addition , significant reduction serum creatinine observe patient treat bardoxolone . Based data , hypothesize bardoxolone improve renal function patient diabetic nephropathy suppression renal inflammation improvement glomerular filtration .</detailed_description>
