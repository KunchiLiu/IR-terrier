	<brief_summary>Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) condition airway tighten exercise may cause coughing , wheeze , shortness breath . In many patient , condition cause lung function drop make hard breath . An instrument call spirometer commonly use measure lung function . This traditional mean assess lung function asthma limited ability provide information lung tightness . Hyperpolarized helium magnetic resonance imaging ( 3He MRI ) novel way see air go lung use MRI special gas . The ability see air reach lung may help show accurately medication work make asthma well . The purpose study examine patient EIB order see 3He MRI provide good way measure lung function . Patients give either montelukast sodium , drug improve ability breath EIB , placebo put treadmill induce occurrence airway constriction . The patient 's lung function measure use spirometer 3He MRI .</brief_summary>
