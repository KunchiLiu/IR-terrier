	<detailed_description>Thanks development well diagnostic tool great level professional education , autism identify two year old even young child , early diagnosis justify rationale early intervention begin , good outcome may . However , publish outcome data intervention model effectiveness child begin intervention 24 month . Furthermore , teach procedure consider appropriate old child , ( e.g. , 40 hour per week adult-directed intervention , much repetitive practice sit table ( Lovaas , 2002 ) , 1987 ) consider developmentally inappropriate toddler ( Sandall , McLean , &amp; Smith , 2000 ) . Dawson Rogers implement feasibility study intervention design toddler autism use randomize controlled design . The approach involve relationship-based frame accomplish developmentally base objective use naturalistic application apply behavior analytic principle . The approach fuse Denver Model ( Rogers , Hall , Osaki , Reaven , &amp; Herbison , 2000 ) Pivotal Response Training ( Koegel , Koegel , &amp; Carter , 1999 ) , deliver 1:1 25 hour per week 24 toddler autism two year period . The contrast group receive standard community base intervention . Preliminary result demonstrate large significant group effect 12 month considerable variability intervention outcomes group . All family refer appropriate community service program , refer previously .</detailed_description>
