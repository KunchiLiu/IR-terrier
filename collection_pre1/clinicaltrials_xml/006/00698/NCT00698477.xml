	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives 1 . To identify hypermethylated gene pair pretreatment breast tumor tissue plasma sample locally advance metastatic breast cancer patient use know gene panel include APC1 , Cyclin D2 , RARB , RASSF1A , Twist , Hin1 GSTP1 . Rationale : We others determine optimal panel gene able detect free DNA plasma serum . We determine panel gene effective detect tumor DNA plasma locally advanced metastatic breast cancer patient . Further , determine methylation profile plasma DNA gene different primary tumor presentation , analyze primary tumor DNA fresh frozen sample . 2 . To identify methylation pattern change subset patient ' plasma sample 24 hour completion cycle 1 chemotherapy within 24 hour cycle 2 . Rationale : The optimal timing sample methylation analysis reflective tumor response chemotherapy know . How soon methylation change observe , whether high within 24 hour , tumor responds chemotherapy , whether change observe time one cycle chemotherapy study . ( 3 ) To also identify methylation pattern change breast tumor tissue one cycle chemotherapy . Rationale : To look correlation plasma methylation pattern Secondary Objectives ( 1 ) To correlate observed pattern methylation pre- post-treatment clinical parameter clinical and/or radiological response patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Methylation Patterns Breast Tumor Tissue Correlating With Clinical Response Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In advanced breast cancer , often difficult predict patient respond favorably systemic therapy decide treatment duration option minimize exposure toxic effect . Our goal examine use locally advance metastatic breast cancer tumor tissue plasma , methylation profile pattern pre- post chemotherapy panel biomarkers commonly express breast cancer correlate tumor response patient outcome . Our hypothesis DNA methylation pattern change baseline early course systemic therapy predict disease response progression well survival . In long term , could prove clinically useful limit exposure ineffective regimen allow early identification effective systemic therapy . Core biopsy breast tumor tissue take baseline cycle 1 docetaxel/ketoconazole . Plasma sample draw baseline , 24 hour cycle 1 chemotherapy 24 hour cycle 2 . Thirty patient ' specimen ( 60 core biopsy 90 plasma sample ) utilize . Quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR use analysis several tumor suppressor gene include APC1 , Cyclin D2 , RARB , RASSF1A , Twist , Hin1 GSTP1 . From data , identify preliminary gene panel associate breast cancer undergoes change methylation follow systemic therapy . Thirty paraffin-embedded healthy tissue sample mastectomy specimen blood sample unaffected individual serve normal control . This preliminary study use determine clinical utility DNA methylation breast tumor tissue plasma predictive marker response chemotherapy prognostic marker patient outcome . If relationship find , study change methylation pattern clinical utility influence therapeutic decision-making may expand adjuvant setting..</detailed_description>
