	<brief_title>Effect High Stanol Ester Dose Serum Lipids , Carotenoids Fat-soluble Vitamins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study show 2-3 g plant stanols stanol ester reduce serum total LDL cholesterol concentration 10-15 % . There study cholesterol-lowering effect plant stanols study high dos . In study stanol dose 4 g/d additional cholesterol-lowering effect reach . However , would interest know , effective plant stanols , dose high , whether really threshold effect inhibition cholesterol absorption . Plant sterols stanols find reduce serum β-carotene concentration . Although show affect serum vitamin A concentration , concern arouse safety high dos plant sterol stanols . This unjustified , number plant sterol stanol contain product market continue expand , therefore , possible daily intake plant sterols stanols rise high . In human , metabolism plant sterols stanols completely know . Recently , show plant sterol esterify enterocytes well cholesterol facilitate transport lipoprotein . However , know , consumption high dos stanol ester affect metabolism plant sterol enterocytes transport . This important know , new foodstuff enrich plant sterol stanols cholesterol-lowering developed . In study , aim investigate effect consumption high dos plant stanol ester concentration serum lipid , carotenoid fat soluble vitamin . In addition , investigate metabolism absorb plant sterol intestine without consumption plant stanol ester . Altogether 50 subject normo- hypercholesterolemia ( total cholesterol 4.5-7.5 mmol/l ) recruit study announcement local newspaper . The study carry randomize , double-blind parallel design . The intervention group ( n=25 ) consumes spread oat drink enrich plant stanol ester ( 9 g/d stanols ) control group ( n=25 ) product contain add stanols 10 week . The fast blood sample take week 0 , 9 , 10 14 ( 4 week end test product consumption ) . At week 10 , oral postprandial test perform 40 subject order study postprandial metabolism plant sterol . From blood sample blood count level serum liver enzymes ( 0 10 wk ) , concentration serum lipid , squalene non-cholesterol sterol , α β carotenoid , fat soluble vitamin A , E D ( 0 , 9 10 wk ) serum squalene non-cholesterol sterol ( 14 wk ) analyze .</detailed_description>
