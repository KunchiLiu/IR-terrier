	<brief_summary>The purpose research help u study vaccine treatment patient prostate cancer . A vaccine medicine teach body destroy harmful infection foreign substance . The immune system make many different type cell , fight infection disease body . A vaccine may stimulate immune system destroy cancer cell . It may also help slow growth cancer . The vaccine solution give injection give skin . It make several part . The first part MUC-2 , protein present many cancer , especially prostate cancer . MUC-2 attach material call KLH keyhole limpet hemocyanin . KLH purify snail- like marine mollusk call keyhole limpet use many year boost immune response animal people . Attaching MUC-2 KLH help immune system react MUC-2 . The mixture MUC-2 attach KLH turn mixed material call QS21 , bark tree , also help immune system make cancer- fighting cell . A vaccine like one receive give laboratory animal show produce immune response animal .</brief_summary>
