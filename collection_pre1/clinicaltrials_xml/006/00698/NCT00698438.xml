	<brief_summary>purpose study compare standard trabeculectomy Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt implantation scleral flap eye open-angle glaucoma.In report , describe result prospective , randomized trial subject bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma underwent two procedure fellow eyes.Design : Prospective , randomized clinical trial . Participants : 15 subject bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma Methods : Subjects underwent two procedure fellow eye . Safety efficacy evaluate two year . Main Outcome Measures : Mean IOP surgical success rate . Results : Mean IOP similar Ex-PRESS trabeculectomy eye time point except month 9 , Ex-PRESS eye low mean IOP ( 13.2 mmHg v 16.5 mmHg , respectively ; p=0.025 ) . Percent IOP reduction also similar time point except postoperative day 1 , trabeculectomy eye low ( 75.5 % vs 65.8 % , respectively ; p=0.003 ) , likely due high rate early hypotony trabeculectomy eye versus Ex-PRESS eye ( 47 % vs 7 % , respectively ) . Complete ( without medication ) qualify ( without medication ) successes common IOP cut-off value Ex-PRESS eye trabeculectomy eye last visit ( p=0.015 , p=0.015 respectively ) . Postoperative complication uncommon group , trabeculectomy eye require postoperative intervention Ex-PRESS eye .</brief_summary>
