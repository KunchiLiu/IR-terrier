	<brief_title>Haploidentical Natural Killer ( NK ) Cells Patients With Relapsed Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental Therapy : NK cell part immune system ( cell body naturally fight disease infection ) . NK cell sometimes destroy tumor cell , may better destroy tumor cell NK cell `` mismatch '' certain protein call human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) . This determine look donor 's recipient 's HLA type check specialized protein donor 's NK cell ( call killer immunoglobulin receptor [ KIR ] ) . The NK cell collect donor 's blood process use experimental device call CliniMACS device . This device design separate NK cell rest donor 's collect white blood cell , use special magnet . Before infused recipient ( , choose take part ) , collect NK cell treat study drug call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) order try activate NK cell ' kill ability . You also receive IL-2 injection try help NK cell survive infusion possibly increase number . Screening Tests : Within 28 day start treatment study , `` screening test '' help study doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test perform : - To check status disease , bone marrow aspiration biopsy perform . To collect bone marrow biopsy aspirate , 2 area hip bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn needle . - For another check status disease , likely need compute tomography ( CT ) scan neck , sinus , chest , stomach area ( abdomen ) , hip area ( pelvis ) , brain . - If doctor think necessary , status disease also check standard/routine test positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , iodine-131-meta- iodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG -- test use injected radioactive material special scanner locate tumor ) , and/or bone scan . - To measure heart rate level oxygen blood , pulse oximetry test . This test use clothespin-shaped device go finger minute . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test check disease ( infection human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] ) . You tell result test diseases . If one infection , probably able participate study . - Urine additional 4 teaspoon blood may also draw routine test check disease status . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw use test HLA KIR typing , donor tell result test . - Females able child must negative serum pregnancy test ( part blood sample describe , possibly additional 1 teaspoon ) . These screening test would also need repeat additional NK cell infusion study , order see continue eligible receive one . This described . Identifying Eligible Donor : Your relative , must share half HLA gene eligible study , test see KIR molecule `` mismatch '' researcher believe help donor 's NK cell target tumor cell body . The donor 's blood also test guard possibility transmit infection NK cell infusion . Samples donor 's blood use help researcher develop future test use track long infused NK cell survive function recipient ' body . In order help track cell infusion , researcher prefer ( require ) female recipient , donor male male recipient , donor female . Conditioning Phase : If find eligible take part study , start `` conditioning '' phase study within 4 week screen test . Over course 6 day , receive chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine weaken immune system order help survival infuse NK cell , mesna protect bladder side effect cyclophosphamide may cause . Cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , mesna preferably infuse indwell catheter ( tube remain vein , tunneled arm chest ) . If already indwell catheter place , need new one place . If new catheter need , however , ask sign separate inform consent form placement . The Conditioning schedule follow : -Starting 6 day NK cell infusion ( consider Day -6 ) day Day -2 , receive fludarabine vein , 30 minute . On Days -5 -4 , receive cyclophosphamide vein , 2 hour time . -Five time per day Days -5 -4 , receive mesna vein , 15 minute time . Infusion NK Cells : On Day 0 receive NK cell vein , preferably indwell catheter . The doctor decide amount NK cell infuse , affect long infusion last , usually last less 1 hour . To help prevent allergic reaction infuse cell ( fever chill ) , receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) vein , 15-30 minute , Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) mouth . You also receive fluid vein help decrease risk kidney damage . You caregiver trained perform IL-2 injection . This drug inject skin 9 dos course 3 week . If doctor decides eligible receive NK cell infusion Day 0 , take study without receive donor 's NK cell . The collected NK cell thrown away . Blood Test Measuring NK Cell Survival : Blood ( 4 teaspoon time ) drawn test see long NK cell survive body . This blood drawn Day 0 ( NK cell infusion 2 hour later ) Days 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 . ( It possible blood draw schedule stop early disease get bad infused NK cell longer see . ) Possible Additional NK Cell Infusion : If neuroblastoma responds suffer new intolerable side effect NK cell , may eligible receive 1 additional infusion NK cell . If , rest study procedure would ( screen test determine eligibility , requirement donor still eligible , Conditioning Phase chemotherapy , IL-2 injection , blood test ) . You must use donor , still eligible . Hospitalization : So monitored side effect , need stay hospital Day -6 NK cell infusion ( longer medically necessary ) . Follow-Up Visits : After final NK cell infusion , return follow-up visit least 3 time week first 3 week . Then return follow-up visit around Day +28 3 month last NK cell infusion . Following 3 month visit , ask return follow-up visit every 3 month one year last NK cell infusion . Below schedule do visit : - Initial 3 week post infusion ( 3 time per week ) : - Any change medical history record , physical exam perform . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Day 28 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month infusion visit : - Any change medical history record , physical exam perform . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Urine additional 4 teaspoon blood may draw routine test check disease status . - CT scan neck , sinus , chest , abdomen , pelvis perform , CT brain may also perform study doctor feel need . MIBG scan may perform tumor positive MIBG scan past doctor feel need . -Bone marrow biopsies/aspirations may perform first month , may do visit neuroblastoma bone marrow time start study doctor feel necessary . PET scan and/or bone scan may perform sometime Months 2 3 , month 6 -12 doctor feel need . This investigational study . Cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , mesna , IL-2 commercially available FDA approve use neuroblastoma . Injecting IL-2 skin FDA approve use increase production NK cell . The CliniMACS device commercially available FDA approve . Infusing NK cell patient neuroblastoma also consider experimental . At time purpose , NK cell infusion CliniMACS device use research . Up 10 recipient 10 donor take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
