	<brief_summary>Sepsis common cause morbidity death intensive care unit . Clinical laboratory sign systemic inflammation , include change body temperature , tachycardia , leukocytosis , neither sensitive specific enough diagnosis sepsis . The diagnosis sepsis difficult , clinical sign unspecific . These sign include tachycardia , leucocytosis , tachypnoea , pyrexia , collectively term systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . SIRS common critically ill patient , find various condition include trauma , surgery , burn , pancreatitis , post-cardiac arrest syndrome , cardiac surgery . Microbiological culture use distinguish sepsis non-infectious condition . However , method lack sensitivity specificity , often substantial time delay . So sign also mislead critically ill patient often present systemic inflammatory response syndrome without infection . This issue paramount importance , since therapy outcome differ greatly patient without sepsis ; clinician often prone overuse antibiotic therapy afraid treat potential infection superinfection . Moreover , widespread use antibiotic patient likely increase antibiotic resistance , toxicity , cost . On opposite , delay administration antibiotic extremely detrimental infected patient exponential increase odd ratio death . Search early biomarker tool diagnosis infection , initially promise , quite challenge controversial nowadays relate inflammation response , irrespective insult . Furthermore 40 % infection remain strongly suspect bacteriologically document . Persisting research ongoing find new marker well discriminate SIRS related infection process SIRS related infection . Cytokine profile use multiplex analysis seem related severity SIRS trigger SIRS ( infectious non infectious disease ) . Thus , new tool develop identify bacteria detect DNA various technique . These technique many potential interest conventional microbiologic test decrease turnaround time ( within hour 2-6 hour ) , reduce inhibitory effect prior use antibiotic , detection slow fastidious grow organism . However test remain validated clinical setting . The goal current study evaluate diagnostic value plasma detection bacterial DNA ICU patient clinical suspicion bacterial infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal current study evaluate diagnostic value plasma detection bacterial DNA ICU patient clinical suspicion bacterial infection . Definitions septic syndrome base ACCP/SCCM expert panel . Terms Definition criterion Infection Invasion microorganism normally sterile tissue Systemic inflammatory response Syndrome ( SIRS ) At least 2 4 follow criterion : - Temperature &gt; 38°C &lt; 36°C - Heart Rate &gt; 90 beat/min - Tachypnea &gt; 20/min PaCO2 &lt; 32 mmHg - WBC count &gt; 12 000/mm3 &lt; 4 000/mm3 Sepsis SIRS relate infectious process Severe Sepsis Sepsis : - Arterial hypotension ( SBP &lt; 90 mmHg , MAP &lt; 70 SBP decrease &lt; 40 mmHg ) - Or organ dysfunction : - PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 250 ( &lt; 200 pneumonia ) - Oliguria ( &lt; 0,5 ml/kg/h least 2 hour ) - Hyperlactacidemia ( &gt; 3mmol/l ) - Platelet count &lt; 80000/mm3 Septic shock Severe sepsis persist hypotension ( &gt; 1 hour ) despite adequate fluid resuscitation require vasopressor support ( epinephrine norepinephrine ) . SBP : Systemic blood pressure , MAP : Mean arterial blood pressure , All code definition establish prior study initiation . The following information record : age sex , admission category ( medical , schedule surgery , unscheduled surgery ) , origin ( home , ward , emergency room ) , McCabe score , ICU hospital mortality . Severity illness evaluate first ICU day use Simplified Acute Physiology Score ( SAPS II ) , Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score , Acute Physiologic Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II score . Knaus scale definition use record preexist chronic organ failure include respiratory , cardiac , hepatic , renal , immune system failure . The presence absence infection document accord standard definition develop Centers Disease Control ; We determine three group : 1. patient documented infection 2. patient without documented infection 3. patient suspect non documented infection . Study protocol Four center participate ( 65 bed overall ) . Along clinical C-reactive protein ( CRP ) procalcitonin ( PCT ) measurement use clinical routine lab measurement , two blood sample ( 4.5 mL ) collect . CRP PCT collect routinely patient meet criterion SIRS three ICUs help u distinguish infectious non-infectious SIRS . One whole blood EDTA rapidly process bacterial/fungi DNA detection . ( frozen analysis within 72 hour sample keep 4°C ) . The second sample use tube contain Gel dipotassium EDTA allow separation centrifugation ( 1500g 10 minute 4°C ) plasma ( white red ) blood cell without manipulation thus lower risk nurse ' occupational exposure . Then plasma store -80°C analysis . Blood collection perform SIRS criterion meet either admission later ICU stay ( suspicion surperinfection ) . Bacterial Fungal DNA detection The bacterial Fungal DNA detection perform use Multiplex PCR pathogen detection VYOOTM ( SIRS-Lab GmbH , Jena , Germany ) . VYOOâ combine culture-independent pathogen-derived nucleic acid concentration multiplex PCR-based specie detection . The multiplex PCR delivers result high therapeutic value within ~6 hour detect 34 bacterial 6 fungal specie cause life-threatening infection well five frequent resistance marker . In order ensure high clinical validity , primer selection specie antibiotic resistance base international study result septic infection . The system prove far less susceptible contamination blood culture alternative NAT protocols ensures increase specificity sensitivity . VYOOâ achieve high sensitivity include sample preparation system LOOXSTER® base SIRS-Lab 's proprietary PUREPROVE® technology . LOOXSTER® specifically concentrate minute quantity bacterial fungal DNA huge human DNA background . Total DNA apply onto affinity chromatography column matrix-immobilized DNA binding protein recognize definite motif within pathogen DNA . More 90 % human background DNA remove . This effect substantially increase sensitivity downstream multiplex PCR protocol simultaneously reduce time-to-result . The pathogen cell within 5 ml whole blood disrupt mechanically use glass bead ( 0.1/2.5 mm diameter ) lysis device ( e. g. FastPrep®-24 , MP Biomedicals , Solon , OH , USA ) . After proteolytic digestion step , total DNA isolate use short spin column protocol . The total DNA dissolve appropriate buffer apply LOOXSTER® spin column . The final bacterial plus fungal/human DNA ratio significantly increase concentrated pathogen DNA directly use multiplex PCR . Generated pathogen specific amplicons visualize gel electrophoresis compare VYOOâ-specific DNA length marker proof present pathogen resistance . An alternative amplicon attribution achieve hybridization ( ATâ system , Clondiag ) , ensure high degree specificity sensitivity . Cytokines detection ELISA Dosage plasma cytokine ( IL-6 , 8 , 10 ) perform ELISA method use commercially available kit ( R &amp; D system , Minneapolis , MN ) Bio-Plex Multiplex Cytokine Assay ( BioRad Lab. , Hercules , CA ) . Endotoxin &amp; Peptidoglycan detection For endotoxin dosage , use Limulus Amebocyte Lysate ( LAL ) reagent water ( LRW ) ( Biowhittaker ) non-pyrogenic pipette tip ( Costar ) . The sample dilute LRW non-pyrogenic 96-well culture plate ( Costar ) . Blood sample collect endotoxin free tube contain gel centrifugation make barrier cellular pellet plasma ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . The plasma transfer non-pyrogenic tube keep -20°C test . Detection bacterial endotoxin plasma hinder yellow coloration interferes Limulus amebocyte lysate test give absorbance 405 nm , also presence inhibitor . We overcome background absorbance plasma use Diazo-coupling Limulus amebocyte lysate assay give magenta coloration ( Associates Cape Cod Inc. ) . Furthermore , order inactivate inhibitor , plasma dilute 1:4 LRW heat 30 min 60°C show dilution heat procedure allow optimal endotoxin detection plasma . After heat , 50 μl dilute plasma transfer 96-well culture plate incubate volume Limulus amebocyte lysate 30 min 37°C . The reaction stop , specify manufacturer , successive addition 50 μl sodium nitrite HCl , 50 μl ammonium sulfamate 50 μl N- ( 1-naphthyl ) -ethylenediamine ( NEDA ) form diazotize magenta derivative . The optical density read 570 nm endotoxin concentration determine comparison endotoxin standard curve . The detection limit test 0.02 EU/ml endotoxin . Peptidoglycan measure accord newly experimental procedure set Dr. Cavaillon 's laboratory . The technique detect peptidoglycan Gram-positive Gram-negative bacteria already show detect peptidoglycan plasma patient sepsis . Because patent apply technical information presently provide present version add soon possible .</detailed_description>
