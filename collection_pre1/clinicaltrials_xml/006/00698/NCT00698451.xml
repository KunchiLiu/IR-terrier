	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate response rate ( Complete Response ( CR ) Partial Response ( PR ) ) carboplatin DOXIL treatment combination bevacizumab patient platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . All patient receive DOXIL , carboplatin bevacizumab maximum ten 28-day cycle . Patients follow six month follow treatment assess progression-free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Carboplatin DOXIL Plus Bevacizumab Patients With Platinum Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Primary Peritoneal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DOXIL pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) approve use patient ovarian cancer whose disease progress recurred platinum-based chemotherapy . Data suggest combination therapy carboplatin plus DOXIL provide superior benefit single agent therapy . Bevacizumab , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor , approve use combination intravenous 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy treatment metastatic colorectal cancer combination carboplatin paclitaxel ( treatment non-small cell lung cancer ) ; paclitaxel ( first line treatment metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer ) . There data show bevacizumab activity treatment ovarian cancer , currently study platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer combination carboplatin/gemcitabine . No data exist efficacy safety bevacizumab administer carboplatin DOXIL . Based grow interest incorporate bevacizumab ovarian cancer treatment activity see date , evaluation combination carboplatin DOXIL bevacizumab warrant . This single arm ( one dose regimen ) , multicenter , open label ( patient physician know drug give ) study patient platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . This study conduct multiple site across United States . All patient receive DOXIL , carboplatin bevacizumab intravenous ( IV ) infusion maximum ten ( 10 ) 28-day cycle . A disease response assessment occur completion Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 end treatment . Patients follow six ( 6 ) month post-treatment progression-free survival . Disease progression define accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . RECIST accept classification response treatment classification Complete Response ( CR ) , Partial Response ( ( PR ) , Progressive Disease ( PD ) Stable Disease ( SD ) .The primary objective study evaluate objective response rate ( Complete Response ( CR ) Partial Response ( PR ) ) carboplatin DOXIL treatment combination bevacizumab patient platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . The secondary objective assess safety profile carboplatin DOXIL combination bevacizumab well follow efficacy endpoint : Duration response , Progression-free Survival , Time Progression . Safety evaluate use adverse event , clinical laboratory test , test cardiac function first 20 patient enter receive least 2 cycle therapy . Overall safety summarize study completion . DOXIL ( 30 mg/m2 ) , carboplatin ( area curve ( AUC 5 ) ) give Day 1 28-day cycle . Bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg ) give day 1 15 every 28-day cycle . All treatment give intravenous ( IV ) infusion repeat every 4 week 10 cycle .</detailed_description>
