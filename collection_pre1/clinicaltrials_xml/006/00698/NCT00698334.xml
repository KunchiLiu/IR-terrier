	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) common opportunistic infection among HIV infect person live develop country . Directly observed treatment , short-course ( DOTS ) internationally recommended strategy treatment TB . However , efficacy DOTS treatment HIV-associated TB well study . This study aim compare efficacy thrice weekly DOTS HIV-infected versus HIV-negative patient TB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Thrice Weekly Directly Observed Treatment , Short-course ( DOTS ) HIV-associated Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several report suggest initial response antituberculosis chemotherapy comparable among HIV-positive negative population . These series generally demonstrate among `` survive '' Patients , bacteriological , clinical , radiographic response similar two group . However , consistent indication higher rate early ( first month ) death tuberculosis well excessive death cause course treatment noted series . These death appear relate advanced stage tuberculosis diagnosis well debilitate underlie diseased patient suffer primarily drug regimen treat . However , several report Africa suggest increase early mortality receive less-potent traditional isoniazid , thiacetazone , streptomycin regimen modern short-course regimen feature isoniazid , rifampin , pyrazinamide . Excess mortality see also among subset patient AIDS tuberculosis Uganda receive thiacetazone regimen comparison receive rifampin regimen : excess mortality high rate drug reaction sequester among patient elevate level neopterin marker cellular immune activation . Furthermore , several series show modestly great risk relapse recurrence post treatment person AIDS seem relate duration therapy . Perriens colleague study Zaire compare outcome HIV-positive patient treat 6-month regimen ( 2-HRZE daily follow 10-HR twice weekly ) 12-month regimen ( 2-HRZE daily follow 10-HR twice weekly ) . Relapse rate significantly high among receive 6-months regimen ( 9 % ) 12 month treatment ( 1.9 % ) ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . Pulido colleague Spain observe non-randomize series , among patient AIDS tuberculosis , 10 40 ( 24 % ) patient receive less 9-months . Multivariate analysis identify duration therapy major element disparate relapse rate , relative hazard 9.2 shorter-duration therapy . Most recently , multicenter national trial United States compare 6-month 9-month treatment HIV-infected adult pansusceptible tuberculosis . Relapse rate 3.9 % , two patient , 6-month regimen , 2 % , one patient , 9-month regimen ; limited number , statistically significant difference . Several study contrast relapse cure rate among HIV infect uninfected person treat simultaneously identical 6-month regimen . They universally show somewhat bad outcome among HIV infection . Hawkens colleague describe increase risk recurrent tuberculosis group patient Kenya . This report document 10 58 ( 17 % ) HIV Positive patient available follow-up recurrence , contrast 1 138 HIV negative patient , 34-fold apparent relative risk . However , 7 10 experience recurrence major cutaneous drug reaction , interrupt therapy confound issue . But , Elliott Zambia note marked disparity relapse rate without confuse association relapse drug reaction : HIV-positive patient relapsed rate 22-100 patient year observation versus 6/100 patient year among HIV-negatives . A recent Johns Hopkins study Haiti find low cure rate ( 69 % vs. 79 % ) slightly high relapse rate ( 5.4 % vs. 2.8 % , p = 0.36 ) among HIV-infected individual receive 6-month regimen .</detailed_description>
