	<criteria>Demonstrable hypertension define mean sit trough cuff blood pressure ≥ 140/100 mmHg ( SeSBP ≥ 140 mmHg SeDBP ≥ 100mmHg ) mean sit trough cuff BP ≥ 160/90 mmHg ( SeSBP ≥ 160 mmHg SeDBP ≥ 90mmHg ) . Male female newly diagnose hypertensive subject currently hypertension medication . Negative urine pregnancy test screen Not lactate Do plan become pregnant study Will practice birth control throughout study follow : oral patch contraceptive , injectable implantable contraceptive medication , intrauterine device , diaphragm female condom plus spermicide Non childbearing potential must classify one follow criterion Had hysterectomy tubal ligation least 6 month prior consent Has postmenopausal least 1 year Mean sit trough cuff DBP &lt; 90 mmHg mean sit trough cuff SBP &lt; 140 mmHg ( antihypertensive medication ) . Subjects uncontrolled hypertension take multiple antihypertensive therapy ( discretion investigator ) . Signs symptom could exacerbate occurrence hypotension volume salt depletion . History hypertensive encephalopathy , stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . Participation another clinical trial involve investigational drug within one month prior screen . History myocardial infarction , percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization , coronary artery bypass graft , and/or unstable angina within past 6 month . Any history New York Heart Association Class III IV congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . A history New York Heart Association Class I II CHF may exclusionary discretion investigator . History secondary hypertension include renal disease , pheochromocytoma , Cushing 's syndrome . Uncorrected coarctation aorta , bilateral renal artery stenosis , unilateral renal artery stenosis solitary kidney . Evidence symptomatic resting bradycardia . Evidence hemodynamically significant cardiac valvular disease . Presence heart block great first degree atrioventricular block , chronic atrial fibrillation flutter . Uncontrolled Type I Type II diabetes define HbA1c &gt; 9.0 % . Diabetics must documentation HbA1c within 6 month Screening Visit . Undocumented subject must HbA1c assessed prior randomization . Note : Subjects Type I Type II diabetes control insulin , diet oral hypoglycemic agent stable dose least 30 day may include . Evidence liver disease indicate ALT AST and/or total bilirubin &gt; 3 time upper limit normal . Severe renal insufficiency define creatinine clearance ( base CockcroftGault formula ) &lt; 30 mL/min . Clinically significant laboratory elevation Visit 1 compromise subject safety , base investigator 's judgment . Consideration take account potential laboratory effect component blind therapy . Positive one follow test : hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody ( confirm radio immunobinding assay , RIBA ) HIV antibody ( confirmed western blot assay ) . Subjects malignancy past 2 year exclude squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin . Known allergy medication use study . Subjects require take concomitant medication , may interfere objective study ( Refer Section 5.2 listing exclude medication ) . Pregnant lactating female . Current history drug alcohol abuse . A subject medical condition , judgment Investigator would jeopardize evaluation efficacy safety and/or constitute significant safety risk subject .</criteria>
