	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Safety Efficacy Fluticasone Formoterol Combination ( FlutiForm™ ) With Fluticasone Flovent Treat Moderate Severe Asthma Adolescents Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 randomize , double-blind , active-controlled , parallel group , stratify , multi-center study evaluate safety efficacy FlutiForm ( 250/10ug ) twice daily dose 12 week deliver SKP HFA pMDI compare Fluticasone propionate ( 250ug twice daily ) deliver SKP HFA pMDI Flovent® Fluticasone 250ug HFA pMDI adolescent adult patient moderate severe asthma . Only steroid-requiring patient ( inhaled steroid regimen stable least 4 week prior Screening Visit dose great 500ug/day Fluticasone propionate equivalent ) eligible . All patient undergo Run-In Period 14 ± 3 day receive asthma maintenance therapy use Fluticasone HFA pMDI ( Flovent® HFA 50 ug/actuation : 100µg/day ( one inhalation twice daily ) use less equal 250mg/day Fluticasone propionate equivalent inhale steroid , 200ug/day ( two inhalation twice daily ) use great 250ug/day Fluticasone propionate equivalent inhale steroid prior Screening Visit. ) . The use rescue Salbutamol ( Albuterol ) pMDI permit patient need control worsen asthma symptom Run-In Period . At Baseline Visit ( Week 0 ) follow Run-In period , eligible patient randomize treatment group . Treatment assignment stratify accord Baseline FEV1 % predict ( 40-60 % &gt; 60-80 % ) .Study drug administer twice daily 12-week period . Patient visit occur Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 assessment ( include serial PFTs 4 hour ) make . In subset least 66 patient ( 22 patient per treatment group ) select center , post-dose 12-hour serial PFTs perform Baseline , Weeks 2 12 . During Treatment Period , patient may take blind study medication ; asthma medication withhold duration Treatment Period . However , use rescue Salbutamol ( Albuterol ) pMDI permit patient need Treatment Period control worsen asthma symptom .</detailed_description>
