	<brief_title>Earlier Breast Cancer Detection Using Automated Whole Breast Ultrasound With Mammography , Including Cost Comparisons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study Design : A total sixteen thousand woman 16 center , evaluate SonoCiné automate bilateral whole breast sonography screen mammography . In study motor drive carrier use transducer examine breast completely [ Appendix A ] . In way image gather contiguous manner display ciné strip three-dimensional image scan row . These sonogram read one two designated investigator/radiologists site . The mammogram read sonogram perform read , read usual manner department without knowledge automate breast ultrasound . The mammograms necessarily read one investigator . The sonograms initially read score one investigator site . These sonogram review ciné loop three-dimensional reconstruction scan row . The investigator prior knowledge patient 's mammogram reading . The data enter site central computer via internet . This computer personal information subject institution ID number birth date . Following entry data separate reading mammogram sonogram , one investigator ass abnormal mammogram sonogram light image study patient evaluate whether combined reading study would effect patient management . The investigator ' call back , short-term follow-up biopsy recommendation rate mammography , sonography combine reading record . As breast imaging study needle open biopsy recommend mammogram and/or sonogram read suspicious carcinoma . Further diagnostic imaging study order indeterminate finding . 2 . Procedures Patient Entry Study : Each patient request obtain expense screen mammogram entry study . She must also agree screen mammogram one year later . The patient must also give right original film mammogram although copy make patient without charge need . No study require . However patient also require fill demographic form . 3 . Criteria Response Assessment : Each screen mammogram review usual manner institution , necessarily one investigator . Each screen ultrasound review timely manner investigator radiologist , patient inform result either directly physician . If study consider abnormal patient inform call back additional study appropriate action . 4 . Definitions Classification : True false positive negative rate calculate base result three initial image examination , screen mammography ( SM ) , screen automate ultrasound ( SU ) screen study combine ( SC ) ) , perform subject PMA study . The rate calculate three initial image examination independent result initial imaging examination . True Positive - A subject TP three type initial image examination ( SM , SU , SC ) lead biopsy proven cancer ( invasive situ breast cancer , intramammary malignancy ) . True Negative - A subject TN initial image examination whose initial image examination read negative normal screen mammogram ( indeterminate mammogram subsequently show cancer ) one year later , undergone breast biopsy positive cancer base physical finding interim . False Positive - A subject FP particular type study , benign breast biopsy base study , breast cancer elsewhere discover study . False Negative - A subject FN particular type initial image examination , initial image examination normal benign , cancer discover one type initial imaging examination , discover one-year mammogram , discover physical finding interim . Callback - A callback ( CB ) occur subject recall evaluation one initial image examination read positive indeterminate . A SU callback sonographic equivalent diagnostic evaluation order SM positive indeterminate finding . Similarly , SC callback occur evaluation SM SU together indeterminate positive require evaluation . CB rate calculate three initial image examination compare number CB 's total number subject . % CB rate = Number CB 's / number Study subject . Callbacks three different outcome : resolution , show initial imaging examination normal evaluation , short-term follow-up examination ( ) later date evaluate finding initial image examination CB examination ( ) , biopsy initial image examination and/or call back examination sufficiently suspicious warrant tissue evaluation . Follow-Up - Follow-up ( FU ) rate calculate three initial image examination compare number short-term follow-up 's total number subject . % FU rate = Number FU 's / number Study subject . The rate positive follow-up calculate . % +FU = Number +FU 's / Total number follow-up . Biopsy - Biopsy rate calculate three initial image examination compare number biopsy total number subject . % Biopsy rate = Number Biopsies / number Study subject . The rate positive biopsy calculate . % + Biopsies = Number + Biopsies / Total number Biopsies . A subject may one biopsy . 5 . `` Off Study '' Criteria : This study require performance initial mammogram , initial automate screen ultrasound , final mammogram one year . The patient also agree allow access result diagnostic test occur positive finding original screen mammogram ultrasound . The subject may withdraw time , case data utilized analysis . Any patient completing test also exclude analysis . 6 . Statistical Considerations : Since 16,000 patient mostly cover cost test , anticipate come well-screened population . Such population age 40 year would expect generate interval cancer rate 0.25 % annually . Consequently , 40 carcinoma would present discovery study . Given 20 25 % expect false negative rate screen mammography 8 10 cancer available discovery SonoCiné . If SonoCiné independent 20 25 % false negative rate would expect find 6 8 remain cancer . If mammography utilized alone estimate 75 % accuracy , anticipate 30 cancer would identify base mammography screen failure 10 cancer find . With addition Sonociné screening , predict additional 8 cancer would find total failure rate ( false negative finding ) would 2 cancer . This would increase accuracy 95 % . If SonoCiné generally find cancer small size screen mammography , actual number cancer discover SonoCiné may higher , since find cancer would discover screen mammography follow year present clinically . Also woman know high risk breast cancer may disproportionately volunteer study cancer may find mammography automated whole breast ultrasound expect . Since woman aware mammographically dense breast prone falsely negative mammography , woman condition may join study expect . This may produce mammographically occult cancer expect . Breast density one variables record subject . Discriminant Function analysis analysis choice base fact wish distinguish among several mutually exclusive group , best predictor important distinguishing among group , develop procedure predict group membership new case . The concept underlie discriminant analysis linear combination independent variable form serve basis classify case one group . Assumptions include group must sample multivariate normal population population covariance matrix must equal , although discriminant function analysis work fairly well case exception . Dichotomous variable also include predictor variable . Emphasis analyze variable one time consider together . By consider simultaneously able incorporate important information relationship . Because variable interrelate , need employ statistical technique incorporate dependency analyze difference group significance test equality group mean variable utilize F value , significance , Wilks ' Lambda compare within group variability total variability . Small value lambda indicate mean associate variable predict group membership different may lead model development . Since interdependency among variable affect multivariate analysis , important look correlation matrix predictor variable . Prior probability estimate likelihood case belong particular group . Knowledge prior probability calculate base publish statistic estimate .25 % cancer screen population . To take advantage additional information available develop classification scheme probability group membership , classification actual group membership compare predict group membership well use discriminant function . Variables use predict group membership draw Patient Form , Imaging Form Biopsy Form . Variables include initial risk factor , result mammography finding , SonoCiné find result biopsy . Although variable cod categorical , ordinal interval appropriate Discriminant Function analysis use General Linear Model Procedure ( GLM ) .Additional analysis look distribution time event utilizing Life Tables extend Cox Regression model . Efficiency define use resource produce maximum benefit . Cost-benefit analysis perform end study express benefit cost program , dollar quality life reduction suffer . Benefits study , addition increase detection rate , may include time early detection small cancer actual reduction need biopsy . This impact treatment resource utilization also .</detailed_description>
