	<brief_summary>Many study demonstrate people diabetes intensively treat insulin order maintain glucose within normal range , complication diabetes prevent delayed . However , treatment carry significant risk severe hypoglycemia ( excessively low blood glucose level ) , may life-threatening . Thus , ideal treatment insulin patient diabetes see double-edged sword : intensive treatment delay complication also associate increase risk disable hypoglycemia . In normal condition , hypoglycemia occurs , body responds secrete variety hormone activate autonomous nervous system ultimately result increase blood glucose normal level . Patients diabetes , lose capacity effectively respond hypoglycemia become susceptible fall plasma glucose . Paradoxically , repeat episode hypoglycemia—especially vulnerable person type 1 need insulin life -- induce metabolic deterioration increase risk develop hypoglycemia . Our proposal focus understanding mechanism body use order respond hypoglycemia potential tool ( medicine ) may use order prevent metabolic deterioration associate repeat episode hypoglycemia . Based previous data generate laboratory ( others ) , propose repeat episode hypoglycemia associate deterioration `` body sensor '' hypoglycemia diabetes . Moreover , since many study show deterioration response hypoglycemia induce also exercise ( patient diabetes great risk hypoglycemia exercise ) , propose exercise ( stress ) affect hypoglycemia response endorphin release ( endorphins proteins responsible inhibition neuroendocrine response system ) . Developing method decrease incidence severe hypoglycemia result safer control blood glucose , decrease complication diabetes , ultimately well quality longer life many patient diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Responsible Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe hypoglycemia ( SH ) major limitation intensive insulin treatment type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) , near-term prospect perfect insulin therapy without risk dim . Intensively treated T1DM patient suffer impaired counterregulation hypoglycemia ( HYPO ) —ie , HYPO-Associated Autonomic Failure ( HAAF ) HYPO unawareness ( HU ) —which enhance susceptibility SH . The precise mechanism HAAF HU , however , clarify , though multiple redundant control system implicate . Experimental HYPO exercise normal T1DM subject reproduce HAAF HU , provide robust experimental paradigm disorder . We show fructose , infuse catalytic dose modulate glucokinase activity , result augmentation counterregulatory response HYPO nondiabetic T1DM individual . We hypothesize equivalent infusion fructose prevent HAAF nondiabetic T1DM person . Furthermore , since HYPO exercise associate endogenous opioid ( EO ) release , block EO improve HYPO counterregulation , hypothesize repeat HYPO episodes induce alteration modulatory effect EO hormonal glucose counterregulation , ultimately lead HAAF . We also propose HYPO autoregulation , hepatic glycogen metabolism play important role development HAAF HU . The specific aim : 1 ) determine effect previous modulation glucokinase activity counterregulatory hormonal glucose recovery response subsequent HYPO nondiabetic T1DM subject , 2 ) examine effect block inhibitory action endorphins central neuroendocrine response system ( naloxone ) , recurrent HYPO exercise , subsequent HYPO counterregulatory response nondiabetic T1DM subject , 3 ) analyze effect recurrent mild HYPO ( autoregulation ) , subsequent HYPO counterregulation nondiabetic T1DM subject , 4 ) determine effect recurrent HYPO hepatic glycogen content nondiabetic T1DM subject , effect normalization liver glycogen content , mean insulin glucose administration , experimental HAAF T1DM subject .</detailed_description>
