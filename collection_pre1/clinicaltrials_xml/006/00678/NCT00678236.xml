	<detailed_description>Loosening prosthetic component continue play large role total knee alloplasty ( TKA ) need revision . Osteolysis important part prosthesis loosening , still completely understand mechanism . Research show mechanical factor weak bone cement poor contact cement/bone cement/implant interphase contribute loosening implant . Survival cement TKA component also depend careful balance soft tissue around knee , repair low extremity dislocation , design prosthesis level patient ' activity . Sclerosis proximal tibia present problem regard get cement penetrate bone . Poor operative technique , high volume high pressure lavage prepare bone surface , result reduce penetration cement spongiosa early failure prosthesis , measure progressive radiolucent line ( RLLs ) . En tourniquet counter act bleed implant site provide good penetration cement trabecula bone . If bone surface implantation site contaminate blood cement apply , shear strength bone/cement interphase reduce 50 % . In prosthesis use study include tibial plateau central stem stabilize wing , bottom surface recess 1 mm , pocket form surrounded lip provide even thickness cement layer beneath tibial plateau . This assure cement press spongiosa fixation implant . This design double penetration cement compare prosthesis without depressed baseplate . The company behind design successful follow-up system 15 year . A good cement/implant interphase lessen risk penetration debris interphase thus reduce risk development osteolysis aseptic loosening implant . Fixation knee alloplasties do 70 % case use cement . It uncertain whether difference long-term survival knee prostheses two type cement use project . Both type cement study use today knee surgery good , short-term clinical result . It important investigate new type cement order assure future patient best possible result knee alloplasty few re-operations . The goal scientific study determine whether difference early migration prosthesis-near bone density standard knee prosthesis fix Refobacin Bone Cement R Refobacin Plus Bone Cement . Migration evaluate RSA bone density around prosthesis DEXA . The study successful prosthesis fix remain place throughout entire period study , , increase migration measure RSA . The cement type ensure large number solidly fixed prosthesis two-year evaluation period `` best '' .</detailed_description>
