	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate best way evaluate patient chest pain emergency department . It compare receive treatment observation unit admission hospital . Patients treated observation unit undergo cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) test . Patients treat hospital admission undergo test doctor determines best . All patient undergo follow find heart related event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cost Comparison Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Use Emergency Department ( ED ) Patients With Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Almost half patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) possible cardiac chest pain intermediate risk short term death infarction . Most admitted hospital serial ECG 's , cardiac biomarkers , cardiology consultation , stress test coronary angiogram . However , 2007 ACC/AHA guideline suggest patient manage observation unit ( OU ) . Recently , cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) proven accurate traditional test modality diagnosis acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , also receive endorsement American College Cardiology ( ACC ) /American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline . Immediate application CMR OU may improve health care utilization compare standard hospital admission intermediate risk patient . Research hypothesis : 1 . Patients OU CMR protocol low cost index hospitalization standard care . 2 . An OU CMR protocol patient intermediate risk chest pain significantly improve frequency correct cardiovascular admission decision compare standard care . Methods summary : 110 ED patient intermediate risk short-term death infarction , nondiagnostic Electrocardiograms ( ECG ) normal initial cardiac biomarkers , randomize standard care OU CMR protocol . Subjects OU CMR protocol undergo CMR perfusion stress testing , follow serial biomarkers . Standard care subject admit usual cardiac testing . ACS ( infarction , death , coronary revascularization , unstable angina ) assess evaluation hospital course phone follow-up 30 day . Cost hospital care compare among group .</detailed_description>
