	<brief_summary>Studies show choline necessary part human diet . Choline important make membrane cell body , make chemical responsible nerve function . Studies also show choline improves memory rat give choline early stage life . The purpose study find whether choline supplementation ( provide choline dietary supplement ) pregnant woman improve memory function baby bear . In study , hypothesize high dietary choline consumption pregnancy lactation : 1 . Increase maternal choline concentration plasma 2 . Increase breast milk choline concentration 3 . Enhance memory performance child bear supplement mother</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The development brain critical period embryogenesis vulnerable change diet , specifically change choline intake . Babies bear mother eat choline smarter memory test . These effect dietary choline repeatedly demonstrate rodent model series study fund NIH last eight year . Specifically , prenatal choline supplementation rat facilitate cognitive function visuospatial memory , whereas choline deficiency impairs divide attention accelerate age-related decline temporal processing . There two sensitive period rat brain development treatment choline produce long-lasting enhancement spatial memory lifelong . The first occur embryonic day 12-17 ( rat give birth day 21 ) second , postnatal day 16-30 . Choline supplementation critical period elicit major improvement memory performance stage train 12-arm radial maze . These change memory correlate decrease threshold induction long-term potentiation biochemical change . Choline supplementation pregnant rat decrease choline acetyltransferase activity increase phospholipase D ( PLD ) activity hippocampus offspring . Also , increase size cell body cholinergic neuron . In contrast choline deficiency increase activity cholinergic system , affect basal level PLD activity hippocampus . These long-lasting functional , anatomical , biochemical alteration may relate change neurogenesis differentiation fetal hippocampus septum , area brain important normal spatial learn memory . It known finding rodent likely true human , human rat brain mature different rate . Moreover , rat brain comparatively mature birth human brain , human hippocampal development may start around 20 week gestation continue month birth . However , everything know brain development tell u process see rodent occur develop human brain . For reason , extremely likely robust effect observe choline rodent brain importance human . The research first major study human determine whether maternal diet diet baby 's first year influence brain function .</detailed_description>
