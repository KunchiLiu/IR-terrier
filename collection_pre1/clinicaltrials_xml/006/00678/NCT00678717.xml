	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect spinal cord stimulator ( A small wire surgically implanted skin . Low-level electrical signal transmit lead spinal cord alleviate pain . Using magnetic remote control , patient turn current , adjust intensity . ) autonomic nervous system ( sympathetic parasympathetic ) . Some study support spinal cord stimulation suppress decrease sympathetic outflow ( sympathetic nervous system one provide u `` flight fight response '' parasympathetic nervous system one work `` sleep , rest digest '' . ) . The sympathetic nervous system important blood pressure regulation also . However , report regard effect spinal cord stimulation blood pressure regulation chronic visceral pain patient . Most clinical trial focus effect spinal cord stimulation pain relief . We think could use blood pressure , heart rate special analysis signal relationship pain measurement assess effect spinal cord stimulation objective way .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) use since 1967 treatment pain : complex regional pain syndrome 1 , ischemic limb pain 2-5 , fail back surgery syndrome 6 , 7 , refractory angina pectoris 8-11 . Recently , Kapural et al . report case series six patient underwent SCS treatment chronic visceral pain ( CVP ) 12 , 13 . SCS reduce 50 % patient ' pain improve patient functionality 60 % 14 . Animal study suggest dorsal column pathway involve transmission visceral pain 12 , 13 . Clinical study patient visceral cancer show interruption fiber dorsal columns ascend close midline spinal cord significantly relieve pain decrease analgesic requirement 15-18 . Different study support hypothesis visceral pain perception positively modulate descend pathway medulla . Dorsal column lesion lead reduction thalamic activation visceral stimulus decrease visceral pain perception 19 . Visceral innervation occur via sympathetic parasympathetic pathway ; parasympathetic afferent enter vagal afferent carry nociceptive information enter trunk sympathetic afferent carry nociceptive information enter level T6 L3 . Therefore , limit case series use SCS CVP suggest pain relief achieve block segment suppress sympathetic outflow abdomen pelvis 14 . The relationship autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) pain poorly understood . Animal clinical research provide evidence close interaction pain modulatory system ANS 20 , 21 . However , little known ANS function chronic pain patient . Our previous funded work suggest chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) patient reduce LFRRI ( increase expect ) index vagal component HRV ( RMSSD , HFRRI ) also attenuate . The sympatho-vagal balance ( LFRRI /HFRRI ) , ratio LF HF correlate high sympathetic activation 22 , paradoxically increase 23 . We previously demonstrate LFSBP correlate muscle sympathetic nerve traffic orthostatic load support simplified model blood pressure variability 24 . We also show LFSBP abolish ganglionic blockade demonstrate neurogenic origin oscillation blood pressure 25 . Additionally , study reveal decrease baroreflex index ( Î±HF BRSLF ) sit CLBP patient . Blood pressure different CLBP patient , trend high heart rate possibly cause high sympathetic activity heart . These finding reduce baroreflex sensitivity change heart rate support hypothesize alteration cardio-vagal control patient chronic pain 26 , 27 . In summary , sympathetic function assess indirect measure . There data available regard direct assessment sympathetic outflow CVP patient . Sympathetic outflow stimulus specific 28 , 29 . Therefore , characterization rest sympathetic outflow stimulus-induced sympathetic adjustment require simultaneous measurement activity different technique . We propose use microneurography ass sympathetic function second-to-second basis CVP patient . Microneurography directly assess muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) . This technique use define sympathetic response number standard physiologic maneuver . It first develop Sweden Wallin , describe technique record afferent muscle skin sympathetic nerve activity 30 , 31 . MSNA display real-time sympathetic nerve activity , allow definition sympathetic response transient would lose technique . In general , MSNA burst/min good indicator sympathetic nerve activity 32-37 . For example , direct measurement sympathetic nerve activity reflect MSNA useful tool demonstrate increase sympathetic activity important factor pathogenesis essential hypertension 38-42 . In chronic orthostatic intolerance , syndrome autonomic dysfunction young woman MSNA reveal abnormal regional distribution sympathetic activity orthostatic stress . 43 , 44 . Moreover , study child complex regional syndrome adolescent show patient report systemic ANS symptom include dizziness , near syncope postural tachycardia 45-49 . Our case series 5 complex regional pain syndrome patient ( 4 male , 1 female , 32-51 year ) implant epidural spinal cord stimulator pain relief 50 suggest CRPS patient : 1 ) reduce vasoconstrictor response Valsalva , 2 ) A great blood pressure ( BP ) drop strain phase II compare normal less blood pressure overshoot phase IV CRPS patient stimulator turn BP response return normal range spinal stimulator turn . Lastly , muscle sympathetic nerve activity improve SCS result well blood pressure control . All data suggest tight relationship pain control sympathetic function . As well know , CVP difficult treat ill-defined nature treatment SCS moderate success , predict success difficult treat patient probably increase correlate autonomic function ; pain therapy spinal cord stimulation .</detailed_description>
