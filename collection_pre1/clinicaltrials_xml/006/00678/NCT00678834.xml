	<brief_title>Human Tissue Distribution Orally Supplemented Natural Vitamin E Tocotrienol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In nature , eight member vitamin E family : a- , b- , g- d-TCP , a- , b- , g- d-tocotrienol ( TCT ) . Vitamin E research develop highly asymmetrically . Out 25,000+ paper vitamin E PubMed , 99 % deal tocopherol . Recent research demonstrate lack cancer-preventive effect potential adverse health consequence tocopherol ( 6 ) . As result , attention turn towards non-tocopherol form vitamin E ( 16 ) . Palm oil represent major source natural TCT . TCT posse powerful neuroprotective , antioxidant , anti-cancer cholesterol lower property often differ property TCP ( 15 ) . During last five year , laboratory report several striking beneficial property tocotrienols experimental setting . One major concern limit enthusiasm tocotrienol human report vitamin E transport protein , tocopherol-transport protein ( TTP ) , low affinity transport tocotrienol . Using TTP-knock mouse , recently demonstrate oral TCT effectively carry vital organ transport take place independent TTP . With background , purpose project test hypothesis orally supplement tocotrienol reach vital organ human .</detailed_description>
