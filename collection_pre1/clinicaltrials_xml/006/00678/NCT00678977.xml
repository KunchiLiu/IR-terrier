	<brief_summary>This open-label , two-arm , Phase I , dose escalation study evaluate safety tolerability determine optimal tolerate regimen ( OTR ) pazopanib combination gemcitabine ( Arm A ) pazopanib , gemcitabine , cisplatin ( Arm B ) patient advance solid tumor . Patients enrol cohort 3 receive escalating dos pazopanib gemcitabine pazopanib , gemcitabine cisplatin . Dose escalation schema study arm describe protocol . For arm , OTR define high dose combination agent one six patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Six twelve additional patient arm study OTR evaluate toxicity pharmacokinetics . This allow assessment potential drug-drug interaction . Antitumor activity assess use RECIST criterion .</brief_summary>
