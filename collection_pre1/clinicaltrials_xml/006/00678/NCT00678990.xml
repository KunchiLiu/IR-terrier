	<brief_summary>In study islet surface modify carry immobilise heparin ( Corline Heparin Conjugate ) prior transplantation . The primary objective investigate safety efficacy allogeneic islet transplantation use islet coat immobilised heparin . The modification heparin show protect islet attack immediate defence system blood ( coagulation inflammation ) , large portion islet survive initial phase engraft . Evaluation base metabolic blood chemistry parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transplantation islet Langerhans isolate donated organ promise therapy diabetes type 1 . The result far , however , meet expectation due relatively low efficiency . Even situation patient become insulin-free , estimate transplanted islet mass le 25 % islet mass healthy individual , many case require repeat use insulin injection . The islet transfer patient infusion drop liver via portal vein . Researches within Nordic Network Clinical Islet Transplantation series publication show islet subject violent immunological reaction non-specific regard individual patient ( IBMIR ) initial contact blood ( Moberg et al , Lancet 2002 , among several ) . The IBMIR reaction early phase mediate coagulation complement reaction . In study islet surface modify carry immobilise heparin ( Corline Heparin Conjugate ) prior transplantation . The primary objective protect islet attack IBMIR large portion islet survive initial phase engraft . In paper publish research group ( Cabric et . al. , Diabetes , May 2007 ) , beneficial effect immobilise heparin islet counteract IBMIR show experiment lab bench experimental animal . The evaluation transplantation study base metabolic blood chemistry parameter , similar evaluation transplant patient within Nordic Network .</detailed_description>
