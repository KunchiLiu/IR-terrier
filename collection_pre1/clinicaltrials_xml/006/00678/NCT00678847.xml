	<brief_summary>Indication : Subjects chronic venous leg ulcer Primary Objective : • To evaluate efficacy bio-electrical stimulation therapy heal chronic venous leg ulcer Secondary Objective ( ) : - To evaluate percentage wound heal every two week - To evaluate complete ulcer heal every two week - To evaluate time complete ulcer heal - To evaluate recurrence rate end follow-up period - To evaluate pain - To evaluate quality life Study Design Treatment Scheme : This Kingfisher Healthcare NV sponsor , national , multicenter , randomize , prospective study data collect subject chronic venous leg ulcer receive standardized conventional therapy ( SCT ) . Subjects randomize two group receive SCT + placebo SCT + bio-electrical stimulation therapy ( BEST ) evaluate effect BEST wound heal process . Patients answer eligibility criterion receive standardized conventional therapy 4 week actual study start evaluate eligibility accord wound heal rate . Only patient wind surface significantly change ( increase decrease ) randomize treatment period . During treatment period patient receive SCT placebo SCT combination bio-electrical stimulation therapy daily basis two hour , 8 week . Patients follow-up period maximum 8 week treatment period .</brief_summary>
