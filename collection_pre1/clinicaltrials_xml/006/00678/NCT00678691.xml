	<brief_summary>Armodafinil ( NuvigilTM ) isomer drug currently approve FDA treatment fatigue secondary narcolepsy , sleep apnea , shift work sleep disorder call modafinil ( ProvigilTM ) . There considerable label evidence modafinil 's ability reduce fatigue relate multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , cancer relate fatigue , depression relate fatigue . There preclinical study show modafinil alleviate fatigue secondary medication side effect ( diazepam , chlorpromazine ) . This multi-layered evidence base suggest modafinil may able alleviate fatigue regardless medical illness . Armodafinil four complete Phase III FDA regulatory study reveal well tolerate effective fatigue associate obstructive sleep apnea ( Effects Armodafinil Treatment Residual Excessive Sleepiness Associated Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome : A 12-Week , Multicenter , Double-Blind , Randomized , Placebo-Controlled Study nCPAP-Adherent Adults . Thomas Roth et al . Clinical Therapeutics/Volume 28 , Number 5 , 2006 ) , shift work sleep disorder , narcolepsy . Armodafinil yet FDA approve . It felt cleaner , safer , potent isomer . Theoretically , fatigue interpret possibly dictate centrally armodafinil 's propose mechanism ( similar modafinil ) elevate central histamine activity may allow brain interpret low fatigue state , thus allow patient function good day less peripheral fatigue . Fibromyalgia ( FM ) illness may involve medical , rheumatological , autoimmune , sleep , endocrine psychiatric pathology . It syndrome recurrent pain trigger point . Greater 90 % patient report fatigue key symptom well . There several investigation line treatment FM induce pain . Exercise , behavioral therapy , amitryptiline , duloxetine , tramadol , sodium oxybate randomize trial almost focus pain . There study , , look FM induce fatigue certainly ad FM patient ' daily incapacity lower productivity/quality life . Armodafinil drug minimal adverse effect ( headache , insomnia , GI distress , anxiety , dry mouth , dizziness assume low level addiction comparable modafinil ) well tolerate current regulatory study . It may safer tolerability profile FM medication note . As modafinil often study often added augmentation agent patient ' regimen suffer fatigue medical illness , author feel armodafinil would also effective population . The author wish conduct study determine armodafinil safe tolerable treatment FM induce fatigue . This initial control study may allow continue regulatory study product FM subject . We propose double-blind placebo control study determine armodafinil safe effective reverse FM induce fatigue .</brief_summary>
