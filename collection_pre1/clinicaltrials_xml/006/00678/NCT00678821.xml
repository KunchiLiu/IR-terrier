	<brief_summary>This study determine rehabilitation exercise program help people pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) increase physical activity . Patients PH increase blood pressure pulmonary blood vessel ( artery , vein capillary ) lead shortness breath , dizziness , fainting symptom . Healthy volunteer people pulmonary hypertension 21 75 year age may eligible study . All participant undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination - 6-minute walk test : Subjects walk fast 6 minute walk track determine ability participate physical activity . - Questionnaires : Subjects complete nine questionnaire relate fatigue , daily physical activity , mood , forth . - Maximum treadmill test : The exercise begin easy level gradually increase subject say long continue investigator decides safe continue . Subjects fit mask , electrode light sensor measure well heart work well muscle use oxygen . Patients pulmonary hypertension undergo follow additional procedure : - Activity monitoring : Patients wear monitor 3 day measure movement heart rate . - Group assignment : Patients randomly assign Group 1 ( education plus aerobic exercise ) Group 2 ( education follow exercise ) . - Group 1 patient attend class three day week either Inova Fairfax Hospital Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center The National Institutes Health 10 week . Two session week include 1 hour education session well 30-45 minute track treadmill exercise session . The third session include exercise . During education patient learn healthy lifestyle pulmonary hypertension . After 10 week education exercise , subject repeat 6-minute walk test , maximum treadmill test questionnaire . - Group 2 patient participate 2 ; 1-hour educational session either Inova Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center The National Institutes Health 10 week . After class , repeat 6-minute walk test , maximum treadmill test questionnaire . The follow 10 week consist 3 day week 30-45 minute track treadmill walk either Inova NIH , repeat questionnaire , treadmill walk test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose randomized trial determine safety effectiveness aerobic exercise patient primary pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) PH secondary interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) . This project first series study aim establish exercise prescription general rehabilitation guideline patient advanced lung disease . An essential treatment almost cardiovascular pulmonary disorder aerobic exercise training . The effectiveness exercise rehabilitation establish exercise rehabilitation become standard care patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . However , fundamental information mechanism underlie exercise training therapeutic benefit remain lack patient advanced lung disease general specifically PH . Subjects age 21 year . The patient enrol site within reasonable travel distance great Washington area receive exercise training Inova Fairfax Hospital National Institutes Health ( NIH ) main campus . Exercise-based rehabilitation already common patient PH Inova Fairfax Hospital . Their pulmonary rehabilitation program well establish , staff experience provide exercise therapy patient PH advance lung disease . The Rehabilitation Medicine Department ( RMD ) The NIH Clinical Center establish pulmonary rehabilitation program protocol well provide rehabilitation service NIH clinic patient . There two primary treatment arm . Patients PH randomize either aerobic exercise training plus education ( AET ) education ( Ed-only ) treatment . A comparison group patient ILD secondary PH ( ILD-only ) also undergo AET arm . Exercise train consist 10-week regimen supervise treadmill ground walk three time week . Exercise session duration 30 minute progress 45 minute per session 10 week . The intensity exercise 70 80 % heart rate reserve . There also two secondary study . First , subject PH initially randomize education arm complete aerobic exercise training program participation education . In addition , also compare baseline test among patient PH , patient ILD-only healthy control . The study outcome measure assess NIH , RMD . These include pre- post-exercise training comparison symptom limited treadmill exercise test assess heart rate , pulse oximetry , EKG , maximum oxygen consumption , bioelectrical impedance cardiography , near infrared spectroscopy measurement muscle oxygenation . We also assess accelerometry base activity , 6-minute walk distance , number quality life functional measure questionnaires include : International Physical Activity Questionnaire , Fatigue Severity Scale , SF-36v2 Health Survey , Human Activity Profile , Stages Exercise Change , Exercise Self-Efficacy , Profile Mood States , Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review . This study represent unique opportunity ass effect exercise patient advance lung disease may open valuable new treatment option patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PH ILDonly Groups : Subjects study include individual ILD PH refer Pulmonary Rehabilitation . Patients ILD , PH PH comorbid ILD include . The following list provide specific inclusion criterion : Between age 2182 year WHO functional class II III , accept WHO functional class I IV base 6 minute walk test result ( less equal 400 meter Class I great equal 50 meter Class IV ) No recent syncope significant chest pain No prior Pulmonary Rehabilitation receive within last 6 month . Physically inactive , participation structure exercise program 3 day week 30 minute session include pulmonary rehabilitation maintenance within last 6 month . Patients may qualify one follow condition : PAH diagnose right heart catheterization define rest pulmonary mean arterial pressure equal high 25 mmHg Interstitial lung disease , include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , nonspecific pulmonary fibrosis ( NSPF ) , sarcoidosis form chronic lung fibrosis base clinical context via clinic note primary pulmonologist echo within one year enrollment show RVSP &lt; 40mmHg . 1 . If RVSP low 40mmHg patient interstitial lung disease enrol without need right heart catheterization . 2 . If RVSP indeterminate echo procedure perform within year enrollment , patient undergo another echo test The National Institutes Health , Echocardiogram Laboratory . 3 . Only RVSP unable estimate echo NIH , absence follow abnormality echo use : right ventricular enlargement , right ventricular hypertrophy , paradoxical movement interventricular septum and/or alter pulmonary flow velocity . If RVSP unable estimate abnormality absent echo , patient enrol ILDonly patient . If echocardiographic abnormality present patient enrol result right heart catheterization obtain verify absence pulmonary hypertension . Healthy Controls : The control include individual never diagnose primary secondary PH apparently healthy . Controls match PH cohort age , gender , body mass . Between 21 82 year Physically inactive , participation structure exercise program 3 day week 30 minute session . No cardiorespiratory pulmonary disease No diseases neurological , metabolic , renal , musculoskeletal system No medication would influence aerobic capacity treadmill performance EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH PH , ILDONLY AND HEALTHY CONTROLS : Since goal examine exercise response adaptation affect PH , patient ( except primary disease secondary PH ) medical condition would impair aerobic capacity ability engage physical activity . These condition would include affect cardiovascular , pulmonary , metabolic , neurological , musculoskeletal system . Specific exclusion criterion PH control cohort : Significant Restrictive Obstructive Lung Disease FEV1/FVC ratio less equal 65 percent Diagnosis ischemic heart disease Left ventricular dysfunction ejection fraction le 40 documented pulmonary capillary wedge pressure great equal 18 mmHg . Acute cor pulmonale Dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Nonidiopathic cardiomyopathy Significant hepatic renal dysfunction Metastatic cancer life expectance le 6 month Disabling stroke Active substance abuse Severe psychiatric disease Patients Antiretroviral Therapy Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus history DKA Mitochondrial disease Pregnancy Ongoing tobacco use Children : Individuals young 21 year include protocol reference range normative aerobic capacity aerobic fitness establish age range .</criteria>
