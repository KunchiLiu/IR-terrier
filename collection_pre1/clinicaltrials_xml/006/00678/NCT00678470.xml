	<brief_summary>This single-center , open-label , pilot study . A total 18 subject enrol 6 month study evaluate whether response intralesional alefacept injection prior standard course intramuscularly ( IM ) treatment predict clinical outcome psoriasis patient . One lesion psoriasis severity assessment score great 3 induration score great 1 identified patient . Each lesion receive one intralesional alefacept injection first three week study ( 1 lesion per week ) . Following 2 week observation period , subject undergo standard 12 week course weekly intramuscular alefacept injection . The Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) score use determine effectiveness intramuscular alefacept treatment . An 8 week follow-up period begin last dose alefacept administered safety efficacy measure continue monitor outline study procedure . The hypothesis response intralesional alefacept injection , whether positive benefit , predict clinical response intramuscular alefacept administration .</brief_summary>
