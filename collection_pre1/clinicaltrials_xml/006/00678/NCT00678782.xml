	<brief_title>Evaluation The Efficacy And Safety Intra-Articular Etanercept Patients With Refractory Knee Joint Synovitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single centre , placebo-controlled , single-blind , cross-over trial , randomization treatment sequence open-label extension conduct rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis spondyloarthropathies patient resistant knee joint synovitis ( KJS ) . Patients eligible suffered persistent active KJS ( characterize pain , tenderness , effusion ) , prove resistant surgical treatment repeat IA corticosteroid therapy , unresponsive minimum 6 month second-line drug therapy DMARD- , and/or anti-TNFα biologic agent monotherapy systemic oral corticosteroid treatment , combination therapy ( drug failure define discontinuation intolerable adverse effect lack clinical efficacy ) . Concomitant Treatments : stable , appropriate dos DMARDs ( methotrexate , sulfasalazine , hydroxychloroquine , cyclosporine ) , DMARD combination low dose oral corticosteroid ( ≤10 mg prednisone ) without non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent continue throughout study . Patients permit stable dos ( great maximum dose recommend manufacturer ) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) permit use one NSAID give time . No analgesic could take undergoing assessment day clinical evaluation perform . Treatment : Each dose study drug administer one intraarticular ( IA ) injection carry single knee joint randomly assign blind treatment 0.5 ml etanercept ( E ) ( 12.5mg ) placebo ( P ) ( NaCl ) . The IA injection administer every two week eight week period . After 2 week time patient crossed-over arthritic knee joint receive E ( 12.5 mg ) four time P three time , respectively , administer every two week eight week period . All IA injection administer synovial fluid aspiration operator . The study , patient KJS flare IA injection ask enter open-label IA extension treatment IA-E injection every two week , eight week . Safety assessment : routine chemistry , haematology urinalysis assessment perform screening , baseline final examination . Tuberculosis screen perform onset study . Patients evaluate clinically adverse event examination . Local tolerance injection site ( ) evaluate control . Assessment patient ' response : perform baseline ( T0 ) 2 ( T2 ) , 4 ( T4 ) , 6 ( T6 ) , 8 ( T8 ) week , end 10 week single-blind , cross-over study end open-label IA extension-study ( 14 week ) ( Tend ) . The primary efficacy endpoint Thompson articular index ( THOMP ) sum score knee joint , pain movement ( 0-3 ) , soft tissue swell ( 0-3 ) warmth ( 0-3 ) ; ( range 0-9 ) . Secondary endpoint : Knee joint articular index ( KJAI ) : sum tenderness score ( 0-3 ) , joint swelling ( 0-3 ) , ballottement patella `` bulge sign '' ( 0-2 ) , range knee joint flexion ( 0-3 ) extension ( 0-3 ) ( KJAI , range 0-14 ) . Standard joint evaluation comprise : 66/68 swollen joint number ( SJN ) tender joint number ( TJN ) ( 0-1 ) ; modify Ritchie articular index ( RAI ) , assessment 30 joint tenderness ( 0-3 ) ( range : 0-90 ) , ( include hand foot distal interphalangeal joint ( DIP ) side group ; pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ( 0-100mm ) , health assessment questionnaire ( HAQ ) - disability index ( 0-3 ) SF36 ( range 0-24 ) time point . The serum CRP , ESR , maximal synovial thickness ( measure grey-scale ultrasonography contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ) assess baseline end treatment .</detailed_description>
