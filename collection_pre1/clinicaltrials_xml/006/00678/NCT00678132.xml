	<brief_summary>Background : - AZD2281 experimental drug class agent call PARP inhibitor . PARP protein involve repair DNA damage ; PARP inhibitor interfere process . - Cisplatin gemcitabine approve United States Food Drug Administration treat certain cancer . Objectives : - To determine optimum dos AZD2281 , cisplatin gemcitabine combination safely give patient solid tumor cancer . - To evaluate response tumor drug combination determine side effect treatment . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year old advance solid tumor cancer standard treatment effective . Design : - In dose escalation study , first small group patient receive small study dos study drug . Subsequent group receive incrementally high dos long precede group experience unacceptable side effect . When high safe dose determine , additional patient enter study receive dose . - Patients receive treatment 21-day cycle follow : - Days 1-4 : AZD2281 mouth twice day - Day 3 : gemcitabine thorough vein 1 hour ; cisplatin vein 1 hour . - Day 10 : gemcitabine vein 1 hour . - Evaluations treatment include follow : - Physical examination , vital sign check blood test every 3 week . - CT scan every 6 week evaluate tumor . - Treatment may continue long beneficial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase-enzyme ( PARP-1 ) recognize rapidly bind DNA single- double-strand break show participate DNA-related function , include gene amplification , cell division , differentiation , apoptosis , DNA base-excision repair . - Increased PARP activity one mechanism tumor cell avoid apoptosis cause DNA damage agent , drug resistance link high expression PARP cancer cell . This differential expression PARP support observe selectivity PARP inhibitor affect proliferate tumor cell . AZD2281 orally administer potent inhibitor PARP-1 PARP-2 , combination cisplatin gemcitabine may overcome resistance associate agent . Primary Objectives : - Establish safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) AZD2281 combination cisplatin gemcitabine patient solid tumor . - Evaluate effect cisplatin-gemcitabine , without AZD2281 , PAR gamma- H2AX level tumor biopsies peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) pre- post-treatment . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) AZD2281 without cisplatin gemcitabine . Eligibility : - Patients ( great equal 18 year ) must histologically confirm solid tumor malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist , associate minimal patient survival benefit . - Patients previously receive cisplatin gemcitabine , , eligible . Design : - Cycle 1 subsequent cycle : AZD2281 administer orally every 12 hour ( Q 12 hour ) day 1 , gemcitabine administer intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour ( 600 mg/m ( 2 ) /hour ) day 1 8 cycle cisplatin 1 hour day 1 gemcitabine . - Dose escalation proceed cohort 3 6 patient minimum 27 maximum 42 patient . - Patients maximum six cycle treatment . - Tumor biopsy collect cycle 1 , blood PBMC sample collect cycle 1 drug administration , 24 48 hour post administration , cycle 2 , day 1 . If Dose Level 3 achieve additional time point collect cycle 1 , day 8 - drug administration , 6 , 24 48 hour post .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm ( NIH pathology department ) solid tumor malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist , associate minimal patient survival benefit . To minimize risk bone marrow toxicity population , patient must two prior severely myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen . Any prior therapy must complete great 2 week prior enrollment protocol patient participate phase 0 ( eIND ] ) study , great equal 4 week patient participate regulatory IND study , participant must recover eligibility level ( CTCAE Grade less equal 1 ) prior toxicity . Prior radiation surgery complete great equal 4 week prior study enrollment associate toxicity resolve eligibility level ( prior irradiate tumor consider biopsy sign disease progression present ) . Age great equal to18 year . Because dose AE data currently available use AZD2281 patient less 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric Phase I combination trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 percent ) . Life expectancy great equal 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal OR Creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/minute patient creatinine level great 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal . The effect AZD2281 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , cisplatin gemcitabine use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 30 day completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients previously receive cisplatin gemcitabine , , eligible enter trial . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study , recover AEs due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients must great equal 2 week since investigational agent administer part exploratory IND study recover eligibility level toxicity . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , prolong QTc interval ( great 500 msec ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . In Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) UseinPregnancy Ratings Drugs , cisplatin gemcitabine classify category D drug , indicate investigational postmarketing data show risk fetus . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 30 day completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because risk AEs nursing infant secondary treatment mother drug , breastfeed discontinue patient trial 30 day completion treatment trial . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 1 month treatment brain metastasis without steroid ( except maintenance replacement dose steroid ) antiseizure medication . Patients clinically significant illness could compromise participation study , include , limited , active uncontrolled infection , immune deficiency confirm diagnosis HIV infection , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement exclude trial . Patients lymphomas primary CNS malignancy exclude study .</criteria>
