	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , one lead cause morbidity mortality elderly characterize progressive cognitive decline certain neuropathological feature . Currently , great interest well-documented mitochondrial ( oxidative ) lesion AD . Disturbed oxidative metabolism well describe abnormality AD . Several observational study show moderate consumption wine associate low incidence Alzheimer 's disease ( Truelsen et al. , 2002 ; Luchsinger et al. , 2004 ) . Wine enrich antioxidant compound potential neuroprotective activity . In early 1990s presence Resveratrol red wine detect suspect afford antioxidant neuroprotective property ( Miller Rice-Evans , 1995 ) . Blass Gordon ( 2004 ) demonstrate positive effect AD oral preparation glucose , malate resveratrol . Glucose physiological precursor substrate oxidative metabolism brain , malate primer energy-providing Krebs-cycle . Glucose malate therefore provide reduce equivalent ( electron ) regenerate reduce form resveratrol , normal regulation brain cell metabolism . All three ingredient classify FDA Generally Recognized As Safe .</brief_summary>
