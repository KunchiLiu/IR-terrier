	<detailed_description>Background : Pain Assessment : Whereas temperature , pulse , respiration , blood pressure objectively measure , pain inherently subjective . Given fundamental difficulty , wonder failure properly assess pain common cause poor control lack treatment patient different setting ( 1 ) . Moreover , pain multidimensional , `` sensory-discriminatory , cognitive-evaluative , affective-motivational '' component ( 2 ) , word , affect body , mind , spirit , complexity make hard measure ( 1 ) . Since pain recognize important modality , influence recovery quality life patient , term `` fifth vital sign '' evaluate register patient ' chart routine checkup . Pain repeatedly rat patient caregiver medical personnel , follow treat . For routine standardization , pain chart scale 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad pain possible ) . At pain intensity 0 4 patient describe interference function mild ( reflect daily activity mood ) , 5 6 described moderate , 7 10 severe ( 2 ) . For standard scaling , different assessment tool develop . One-dimensional pain scale , patient ask describe intensity pain , use tool today ( 1 ) . These VAS- Visual analog Score ( e.g. , patient place mark 10-cm line indicate intensity pain ; one end line label `` pain '' `` bad possible pain '' ) , Numeric ( `` please rate intensity pain scale 1 10 '' ) Categorical ( `` please rate pain none , mild , moderate , severe '' ) . These scale reliable valid use conjunction World Health Organization ( WHO ) analgesic ladder guideline . ( 3 ) The one-dimensional intensity scale modify produce pain relief scale , patient pain satisfaction scale , pain management index ( 4 ) . Moreover , comprehensive multidimensional pain assessment tool Brief Pain Inventory develop help pain management specialist 's measure ass effect pain mood , activity , quality lifeâ€”which one-dimensional tool . ( 2 ) These tool difficult patient medical personnel complete usually use daily practice ( 1 ) . In recent year grow interest pain treatment generate great number study assessment tool . The tool basically regard reliable Grossman SA et al ( 5 ) find intensity pain express patient self-assessment scale correlate poorly caregiver ' assessment pain , great intensity pain , poor correlation patient caregiver . Moreover , patient , communicate medical staff unconscious , sedated patient , young pediatric patient psychiatric mentally retarded patient , evaluate subjectively caregiver medical staff , wide variation always assess correctly pain status suffering patient . For reason objective pain assessment tool suggest recent past , accurate comprehensive indication modality patient different setting include sedation anesthesia . Objective pain assessment : Different mathematical tool , mostly heart rate variability , heart rate spectral analysis study assess depth anesthesia pain ( 6-7 ) . Most works do human patient do pain recognition neonate ( ) . Some work adult patient do , try define pain use heart rate analysis . Since acute effect pain increase heart rate well know , hypothesize Storella et al . ( 10 ) , work may adaptive effect chronic pain autonomic regulation cardiovascular system could reverse analgesia . They examine whether acute relief chronic pain affect heart rate variability conclude study , base experimental data acute relief chronic pain accompany analgesia-specific increase heart rate variability many patient . Ray et al . work use method ECG signal processing develop new monitor pain assessment anesthesia ( 11 ) . Using heart rate signal , R-R interval spectral analysis calculate . The output contain information respiratory cycle RSA ( respiratory sinus arrhythmia ) drawn assume level consciousness proportional . That study demonstrate feasibility method , article state many drawback restriction system clinically method use today . Methods Signal processing : We know physiological signal ECG EEG consist mixture variety pattern phenomena accrue different pattern different time point record . Some occur short time interval , others last long repeat periodically . Another characteristic signal presence high level noise , systematic unsystematic . Traditional analysis method design optimized handle signal include single class pattern pure harmonic ( Fourier Representation/ dictionary ) piece-wise constant function ( Wavelets Representation/ dictionary ) , simplify unreal case , simple operation threshold calculation filter appropriate representation space , effective separation signal noise ( denoising ) , decomposition basic component , pattern detection . However , basic operation use single representation method usually yield mediocre result apply real complex biological signal mention especially case Signal Noise Ratio ( SNR ) low . Recent trend digital signal processing ( DSP ) use novel idea merge several different representation method create call over-complete dictionary , examples approach include Matching Pursuit algorithm , describe Mallat et al ( 12 ) Basis Pursuit algorithm , describe Donoho et . al ( 13 ) . The match pursuit basic pursuit achieve near-optimal solution different kind analyse complex signal provide appropriate representation method use . We intend develop apply novel signal processing tool ECG signal first time . We believe tools potential provide much good insight signal basic component relation different physiological state traditional analysis method practice today base single dictionary . In study intend apply advanced supervise learn method , develop Elad ( 14 ) order adaptively generate optimal dictionary representation method ECG signal use dictionary develop highly effective complete dictionary base analysis method order separate complex ECG signal basic component noise . We intend apply advanced statistical data mining technique order relate basic pattern ECG signal pain sample design group . Test group : In study intend sample ECG two group . The first group comprise 20 healthy young adult voluntarily inflict thermal , pressure neural stimulus pain use TSA 2000 , ( study authorize Soroka University Medical Center IRB Committee ) ; subject VAS ECG monitor , thermal pain induction . It important state instrument inflicts thermal pain authorize protocol , harm produce tissue damage . Hypothesis : Our hypothesis pain detect , discriminate noise diagnose routine ECG sampling use process technique .</detailed_description>
