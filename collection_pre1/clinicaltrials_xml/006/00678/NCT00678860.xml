	<brief_summary>This study test compare computerize paper version eye questionnaire . Questionnaires use medicine gain well understanding disease impact person 's quality life . Computerized version questionnaire often good good paper version , direct comparison two . This study may help development eye questionnaire use understand symptom monitor patient clinical trial . People 21 year age old ocular surface disease ( OSD ) match control subject without OSD may eligible study . All participant undergo follow procedure : - Medical eye history . - Vision test examination front part eye . - Tear measurement : A small piece paper place surface eye measure amount tear produce . The consistency tear measure look fast evaporate surface eye . - Completion either paper-based computer-based version questionnaire 15 minute eye examination completion version within 1 week home . ( Subjects complete paper version clinic tell access computer version online home library computer ; complete computer version clinic give paper version take home . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol compare health-related quality life ( visual function ) report participant use web-based questionnaire versus response obtain use standard paper version questionnaire . This comparison perform population patient diagnose ocular surface disease ( OSD ) age- gender-matched control use randomize , cross-over study design . This type comparative study patient-reported outcome report rheumatology , cardiology , psychiatry , asthma , alcoholism , pain assessment , gastrointestinal disease , diabetes , allergy population ; however , knowledge report study patient ocular disease . The study evaluate agreement score report via two mode administration : web-based version paper-and-pencil version . Components three questionnaire commonly use evaluate visual function , symptom , vision-related quality life OSD include : initial 5 question Ocular Surface Index ( OSDI ) , question # 15 National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire - 25 ( VFQ-25 ) , specify domains National Eye Institute Refractive Error Quality Of Life Instrument-42 ( RQL-42 ) ( clarity vision , near vision , far vision , glare , symptom , worry , satisfaction correction ) . The study also evaluate whether difference mean overall score age , gender , order administration , disease severity . Ocular surface disease , include dry eye disease secondary variety etiology , ophthalmic condition place burden functional vision , also overall health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) , impact similar moderate angina3 . This study add body knowledge field patient-reported outcome measure ( PROs ) , first compare computerized , web-based paper-based version previously validate questionnaire use assess QoL subject ocular disease . There increase interest assess PROs many field medicine , especially context clinical trial HRQoL important component overall evaluation intervention treatment . As use computer increase accessibility internet broadens , tremendous potential harnessing technology future cost-effective , efficient way gather clinical data PROs future ophthalmic clinical trial study .</detailed_description>
