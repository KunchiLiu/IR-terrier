	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess ability eltrombopag elevate platelet count thereby reduce need platelet transfusion chronic liver disease patient thrombocytopenia undergo elective invasive procedure . The clinical benefit eltrombopag measure proportion subject avoid platelet transfusion , , 7 day undergo invasive procedure . In addition , bleed event monitor time . The number transfusion , safety event medical resource utilisation monitor time 30 day undergo invasive procedure help evaluate clinical benefit .</brief_summary>
