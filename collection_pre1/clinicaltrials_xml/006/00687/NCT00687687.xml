	<brief_summary>To estimate antitumor activity paclitaxel , carboplatin , plus BSI-201 patient recurrent advance uterine carcinosarcoma . Based data generate BiPar/Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical PARP inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Paclitaxel ( Taxol , NSC # 673089 ) , Carboplatin ( Paraplatin , NSC # 241240 ) , BSI-201 ( NSC # 746045 , IND # 71,677 ) Treatment Advanced , Persistent , Recurrent Uterine Carcinosarcoma</brief_title>

	<criteria>Patients must advance ( stage III IV ) , persistent recurrent uterine carcinosarcoma document disease progression . Histologic confirmation original primary tumor require . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must great 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpation , plain xray , CT , MRI , great 10 mm measure spiral CT . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST ( Section 8.1 ) . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . Patients must GOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 . Adequate bone marrow , renal , hepatic , neurological function Patients receive prior cytotoxic chemotherapy management uterine carcinosarcoma . Patients history invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer specific malignancy note Sections 3.23 3.24 exclude evidence malignancy present within last five year . Patients also exclude previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol therapy . Patients receive prior radiotherapy portion abdominal cavity pelvis OTHER THAN treatment uterine carcinosarcoma within last five year exclude . Prior radiation localize cancer breast , head neck , skin permit , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Patients MAY receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy localize breast cancer , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Patients symptomatic untreated brain metastasis require concurrent treatment , inclusive limited surgery , radiation , corticosteroid . Patients significant history cardiac disease , i.e. , myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 6 month study registration , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) &gt; class II , uncontrolled hypertension . Patients history seizure disorder currently antiseizure medication .</criteria>
