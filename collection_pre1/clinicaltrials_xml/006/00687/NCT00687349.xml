A total 373 resident 128 NP student two large train program ( UW MUSC ) randomize either intervention usual education . The study 's primary outcome measure QOC score `` communication end-of-life care '' domain . The QOC assess patient , family member , nurse intervention time period trainee . Secondary outcome measure patient symptom patient- , family - nurse-assessed QEOLC score . Outcome measure collect 5 patient family member per trainee intervention period 5 patient family member per trainee intervention period . Process measure resident NP student include pre- post-intervention assessment knowledge , attitude , behavior regard communication use standardized patient assessment well self-assessment faculty assessment .</detailed_description>
