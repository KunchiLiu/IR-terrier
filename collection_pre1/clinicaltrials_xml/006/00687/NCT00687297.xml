	<brief_summary>It show previous study ability treat lung cancer could significantly improve target tumor cell directly chemotherapy , also cut blood supply cancer cell . Blood vessel supply tumor form process call angiogenesis . Vandetanib investigational drug act produce call anti-angiogenic effect . An Anti-angiogenic effect able inhibit development new blood vessel require tumor survive block growth factor need form new blood vessel . The purpose study determine addition vandetanib standard chemotherapy regimen slow stop growth cancer long period time compare time period generally gain use standard chemotherapy alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Vandetanib Combined With Chemotherapy Treat Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer number one cause cancer-related mortality United States , estimate 160,390 death 2007 . Over 80 % patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , majority patient advance disease time diagnosis . Patients advanced disease adequate performance status clearly benefit systemic chemotherapy , many clinical trial carry determine effective regimen . Comorbidities associate NSCLC preclude use cisplatin doublet therapy , , meta-analysis compare platinum-based doublet regimens non-platinum base , third generation regimen reveal survival outcome regimens equivalent . Despite poor response overall survival benefit patient population accept treatment doublet , addition third cytotoxic agent improve survival demonstrate increased toxicity . Therefore , appear threshold maximum response gain cytotoxic chemotherapy alone . However , poor outcome still associate advanced NSCLC clearly demand need continued improvement treatment . It postulate anticancer therapy could significantly improve target tumor cell directly , also target neo-angiogenesis . A randomized phase II trial demonstrate significant improvement time progression ( TTP ) patient receive carboplatin , paclitaxel bevacizumab compare chemotherapy alone . Due life-threatening fatal hemorrhage patient squamous cell histology , well prior history hemoptysis brain metastasis exclude clinical trial use bevacizumab . The definitive study bevacizumab NSCLC randomize phase III clinical trial conduct ECOG ( E4599 ) patient advance non-squamous NSCLC receive carboplatin + paclitaxel without bevacizumab meet clinical endpoint improvement survival lead approval bevacizumab first line treatment patient advance NSCLC non-squamous histology . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) protein activation lead TK activation result cell proliferation , motility , adhesion , invasion , survival , angiogenesis . The EGFR express many solid tumor , include non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , multiple study suggest shortened survival NSCLC patient whose tumor express EGFR . Although study use small-molecule TK inhibitor ( TKIs ) NSCLC meet efficacy endpoint , phase III trial demonstrate benefit EGFR TKI monotherapy . Patients advance NSCLC receive 2 3 prior therapy randomize erlotinib placebo , receive erlotinib demonstrate survival benefit lead FDA approval drug 2004 . The study clearly demonstrate benefit combining anti-angiogenic factor chemotherapy , monotherapy use anti-EGFR agent , patient advance NSCLC . The potential benefit simultaneously target 2 pathway address recurrent disease set . Vandetanib novel oral molecule ( anilinoquinazoline ) dual activity VEGFR EGFR pathway . Specifically , compound potent reversible inhibitory activity VEGFR-2 ( KDR ) , VEGFR-3 ( Flt-4 ) , EGFR RET . Vandetanib TKI thus act inhibition ATP bind tyrosine kinase domains receptor . Recombinant enzyme assay demonstrate vandetanib highly selective VEGFR-2 ( IC50=40 nm ) slightly low affinity VEGFR-3 ( 2.7 fold ) . EGFR tyrosine kinase activity inhibit IC50=500 nm . The result second-line set phase II trial present Heymach et al ASCO meeting 2006 . In trial , patient randomize receive either docetaxel alone , docetaxel either 100mg 300mg vandetanib . Patients squamous cell histology , control brain metastasis prior history hemoptysis allow study . The primary endpoint prolongation progression-free survival ( PFS ) meet 100mg arm ( Hazard Ratio ( HR ) 0.64 , p=0.07 ) . There increased incidence hemoptysis patient receive vandetanib , CNS hemorrhage event observe , side effect commonly attribute EGFR inhibition ( rash , diarrhea ) high 300mg arm . Early combination study suggest patient NSCLC , vandetanib safe combination chemotherapy , may improve outcome chemotherapy use 100 mg dose , activity monotherapy 300mg dose . In addition , none observe hemorrhagic complication see bevacizumab observe , even patient high risk complication . In study , main goal study combination docetaxel + carboplatin vandetanib , follow double-blind randomized assignment maintenance therapy vandetanib 300 milligram ( mg ) placebo mouth daily disease progression determine maintenance therapy prolong progression-free survival . In addition clinical efficacy outcome monitor safety tolerability , well explore difference outcome base age gender .</detailed_description>
