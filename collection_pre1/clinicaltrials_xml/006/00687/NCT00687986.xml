	<brief_summary>The standard treatment early stage I lung cancer surgery . However , surgery associate complication long-term impairment quality life patient . Stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) outpatient technique allow local control rate comparable achieve use surgery . In study , patient stage IA non-small cell lung cancer randomize either surgery SRT order study local regional tumor control , quality life treatment cost 2- 5-years .</brief_summary>
