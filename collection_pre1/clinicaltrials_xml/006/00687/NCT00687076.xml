	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) occur arteries become narrowed hardened build-up plaque fat deposit . PAD develop often artery legs , result reduce blood flow legs foot , occasionally cause leg pain fatigue . Early identification PAD treatment lifestyle change medication help keep leg healthy low risk heart attack stroke , endovascular surgical procedure may necessary people severe PAD . Even endovascular intervention , PAD symptom must continually monitor prevent development progression blockage artery . The best approach monitoring symptom still undetermined . This study compare effectiveness intensive combination lipid modify medication versus standard lipid modify medication treat people significant PAD endovascular intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Intensive Lipid Modification Medication Preventing Progression Peripheral Arterial Disease ( The ELIMIT Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAD occur legs serious disease affect 8 million people United States . A person 's risk PAD increase age also raise smoking diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , heart disease . Symptoms PAD may include leg cramp pain walking , foot pain resting , skin wound ulcer foot toe . However , one three people PAD know seek treatment symptom , many end advance disease require significant medical intervention , endovascular surgical procedure open block artery . While procedure helpful treat people severe PAD , lifestyle modification certain medication also need long-term management PAD improve quality life . An intensive combination lipid modify medication may superior standard lipid modifying medication reduce PAD-associated risk factor improve overall health people PAD . This study compare effectiveness intensive combination lipid modify medication versus standard lipid modify medication prevent blockage re-narrowing artery people significant PAD endovascular intervention . Participation study last minimum 2 year maximum 5 year . All participant first undergo baseline assessment include medical history , vascular physical exam , electrocardiograph ( EKG ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , 3D ultrasound , blood pressure measurement test leg , treadmill walk distance test , urine test , blood draw , questionnaire . A portion blood draw use DNA analysis genetic testing . Participants endovascular intervention 3 month study entry undergo standard care percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) procedure . First , participant complete series clinical review assessment include review social , vascular , clinical history . Next , undergo PTA procedure , involve inflation deflation small balloon area block artery . Additionally , participant may metal mesh tube call stent place blocked area , deem necessary physician . All participant assign randomly receive standard care plus intensive combination lipid modifying medication ( Simvastatin , Plavix , aspirin , Ezetimibe , Niaspan ) standard lipid modifying medication placebo ( Simvastatin , Plavix , aspirin , placebo Ezetimibe , placebo Niaspan ) . Participants take assigned medication daily 24 month . Follow-up visit occur Day 10 ; Week 6 ; Months , 6 , 12 , 24 begin study medication . During follow-up visit , participant repeat baseline assessment clinical review assessment pre-PTA visit . The Week 6 follow-up visit include blood draw , questionnaire , clinical review assessment . Participants also contact phone check status every 2 3 month treatment every 6 month treatment 3 year .</detailed_description>
