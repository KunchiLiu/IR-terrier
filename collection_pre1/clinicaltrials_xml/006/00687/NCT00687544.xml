	<brief_summary>In study , adult Indonesian subject human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) coinfected chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) give peginterferon alfa-2b ( PEG-IFN ) plus ribavirin ( RBV ) combination therapy . The efficacy rate ( sustain virologic response , end treatment virologic response , sustain biochemical response ) , subject morbidity rate cause opportunistic infection ( eg , bacterial pneumonia , tuberculosis , bacterial infection ) , safety tolerability combination therapy examine .</brief_summary>
