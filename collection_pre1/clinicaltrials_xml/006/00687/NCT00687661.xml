	<brief_summary>Kidney disease fundamental part medicine prominence Western society . Common condition diabetes , hypertension kidney infection progress End-Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) also know Stage 5 chronic kidney disease ( CKD 5 ) . Once ESRD begin , kidney function poor best , thus body unable effectively clear harmful toxin blood . A common feature ESRD vascular calcification , process blood vessel ( especially artery ) attract deposits mineral calcium . Over time , deposit harden thicken layer blood vessel , limit blood flow body tissue produce significant disease include hypertension , heart disease stroke . Although process vascular calcification unknown , mount evidence mediate cellular event similar see bone formation body ( osteogenesis ) . With point mind , suggest agent medicine employ limit excess bone formation reduce rate vascular calcification CKD Stage 5 . This study employ one group drug call bisphosphonates use limit bone formation . It study effect vascular calcification adult dialysis patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Presently , exist therapy aim retard progression vascular calcification . One study show agent limit absorption phosphate food ( phosphate binder ) slow progression vascular calcification , result , treatment emphasize phosphate control diet phosphate binder . Other study show use statin , low LDL cholesterol level may reduce progression coronary calcification non-ESRD patient , data ESRD lacking . While treatment helpful , improvement patient ' outcome overwhelm positive . This propose study first study use bisphosphonates vascular calcification . Repeated study show impressive reduction calcification rate several animal model , begs question , bisphosphonates fare human subject ? Preliminary research begin , clearly expansive trial human need explore use promising therapy . Our study hop provide insight area cardiovascular research .</detailed_description>
