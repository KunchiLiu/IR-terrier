A comparison Co-STAR treatment group WHISCA treatment group receive ET ET plus progesterone provide insight effect SERMs relative common HT treatment . Co-STAR participant recruit The National Cancer Institute 's ( NCI ) Study Tamoxifen Raloxifene ( STAR ) , multi-center , 5-year , randomized clinical trial among 22,000 woman increase risk breast cancer , compare effect tamoxifen raloxifene risk breast cancer .</detailed_description>
