	<brief_summary>The phase I portion study design determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) BSI-201 two clinically relevant dose regimen temozolomide ( TMZ ) . Secondary objective phase I trial include determine PK BSI-201 malignant glioma patient correlate BSI-201 PK degree PARP-1 inhibition . A safety run-in confirm safety BSI-201 add standard TMZ radiation therapy phase II portion study ass efficacy tolerability MTD dose BSI-201 daily TMZ radiation therapy follow adjuvant TMZ patient newly diagnose GBM ass overall survival primary outcome measure . Information phase study list phase open enrollment . Based data generate BiPar/Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical PARP inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>
