Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis solid tumor malignancy lymphoma responsive standard therapy approve curative therapy . Performance Status score 0 1 accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale . Able swallow retain oral medication . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication four week last dose study medication . However , Sponsor advise contraception use total 16 week follow last dose ( base lifecycle sperm ) . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/mL estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method Section 8.1 wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least two four week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 8.1 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception four week last dose study medication . Note : Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drugdrug interaction .

Part 2 As per Part 1 exception criterion 3 : Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis melanoma , pancreatic , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , nonsmall cell lung cancer , tumor BRAF mutation . CRC must KRAS BRAF mutation positive . Subjects melanoma , CRC , nonsmall cell lung cancer must provide either result BRAF KRAS mutation assay , archive tumor tissue , fresh biopsy . Subjects must incurable resistant standard therapy . Part 3 As per Part 1 : For biopsy portion study , subject must accessible tumor biopsy , willingness provide pre post dose biopsy . Currently receive cancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , surgery and/or tumor embolization ) . Use investigational anticancer drug within 28 day five halflives , whichever short , prior first dose GSK1120212 . A minimum 10 day termination investigational drug administration GSK1120212 require . In addition , drugrelated toxicity recover Grade 1 less . Previous treatment MEK inhibitor . Subjects previously treat BRAF inhibitor eligible approval GSK medical monitor . Current use prohibit medication require medication treatment GSK1120212 . Current use warfarin . NOTE : Low molecular weight heparin prophylactic lowdose warfarin permit . PT/PTT must meet inclusion criterion . Subjects take warfarin must INR follow closely . Presence active gastrointestinal disease condition interfere significantly absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug . Any major surgery , radiotherapy , immunotherapy within last four week . Chemotherapy regimens delay toxicity within last four week ( six week prior nitrosourea mitomycin C ) . Chemotherapy regimens give continuously weekly basis limit potential delayed toxicity within last two week . Note : Use erythropoietin replacement bisphosphonates consider supportive care use permit . History RVO central serous retinopathy .
