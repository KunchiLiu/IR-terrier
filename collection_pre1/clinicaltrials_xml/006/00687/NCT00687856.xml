	<brief_summary>Heart failure progressive disorder weaken heart able efficiently pump blood throughout body . When body 's cell receive enough blood , result fatigue , shortness breath , difficulty carry daily activity . The left ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) device use provide mechanical circulatory support patient end-stage heart failure await heart transplant . Although LVAD support help maintain pump ability heart dramatically improve heart failure symptom , quality life LVAD support far ideal . It show LVAD support select patient may restore fail heart enough eliminate need heart transplant , information need assess heart recovery guide wean LVAD support . Using data collect patient undergone LVAD implantation , study attempt well assess heart recovery generate criterion identify patient eligible removal LVAD support .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Facilitating Ventricular Recovery Mechanical Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate approximately 5 million people United States heart failure , 500,000 new case diagnose year . Heart failure disorder develop many year attribute number condition , include heart attack , coronary artery disease , diabetes , high blood pressure , congenital heart defect . Although many treatment option heart failure , people end-stage heart failure may benefit heart transplant . However , number donor organ available remains limited , make alternative treatment people end-stage heart failure imperative . LVAD support , traditionally use bridge transplant , may also provide alternative life-saving measure patient advance end-stage heart failure . The mechanical circulatory support provide LVAD may allow leave side heart rest recover enough removal device possible heart transplant longer need , least temporarily . However , research area need . Using data collect patient undergone LVAD implantation , study attempt well assess heart recovery generate criterion identify patient eligible removal LVAD support . Participation study last 3 year . First , 3 month LVAD implantation , participant ' medical record , include medical history , medical therapy , cardiac testing , obtain . Next , participant undergo wean echocardiogram ( echo ) 1 month LVAD implantation , necessary , monthly 2 months.During weaning echo , participant LVAD setting adjust , condition monitor , additional data concern status collect . Before echo , participant also undergo blood draw determine much blood thinner receive , necessary . 12cc blood collect 30 day prior VAD implant look gene expression protein express white blood cell blood serum . During surgery , small piece tissue , range size 1/4 inch cub 1 inch cub removed heart tissue . The surgeon remove heart tissue part normal surgical process , surgeon implant VAD . Approximately half tissue store research purpose . 2-6 week surgery second blood draw 12cc drawn look gene expression protein express patient 's white blood cell blood serum . Participants eligible wean LVAD support three weaning echo continue monitor every 6 month 3 year device remove . Participants eligible LVAD remove undergo another echo recover surgery longer take intravenous medication help heart . Data routine follow-up echo also collect participant every 6 month study completion Year 3 . If patient 's heart recovers LVAD remove , interested remove second piece heart tissue would otherwise discarded time removal LVAD .</detailed_description>
