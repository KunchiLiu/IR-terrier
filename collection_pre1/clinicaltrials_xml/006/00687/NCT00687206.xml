	<brief_summary>Patients slight increase blood pressure level increase cardiovascular risk . In particular demonstrate also subject high-normal blood pressure exaggerate blood pressure increase , exercise , structural leave ventricular abnormality show . On hand , last American European guideline management hypertension recommend aggressive treatment young-middle aged subject achieve good control cardiovascular risk due blood pressure increase . In agreement recommendation investigator share idea good blood pressure control achieve rest , also psycho-physical stress condition frequently occur daily life . On basis , investigator decide evaluate efficacy tolerability association valsartan hydrochlorothiazide ( 160 25 mg daily , respectively ) patient high-normal blood pressure first degree arterial hypertension evidence organ damage . The aim study assess early adequate therapy could bring good pressure control ( even physical activity ) regression organ damage without interfere metabolism erectile function</brief_summary>
