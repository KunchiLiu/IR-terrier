	<brief_summary>This study investigate good predict individual gain lose weight easily others . It examine whether increase amount energy body burn 24 hour overeat decrease 24 hour fast help determine easily someone gain lose weight . Healthy people 18 60 year age body mass index ( BMI ) 18.5 kg/m ( 2 ) 24 kg/m ( 2 ) ( overfeed study ) BMI great 27 kg/m ( 2 ) body weight less 350 pound ( weight loss study ) may eligible study . The study require 10-week admission NIH Clinical Center ( 2-week baseline , 6-week overfeeding/weight loss , 2-week post-weight change ) . Participants undergo follow test procedure hospital admission : - Medical history , physical examination laboratory study - Questionnaires assess eat behavior , food preference , body composition , activity level - Body composition assessment ( height , weight , waist circumference , fat mass muscle content DXA MRI scan ) - Oral glucose tolerance test - Meal test measure response certain hormone food - Activity monitor determine activity level - Metabolic chamber study measure calorie burn 24 hour monitor body temperature - Free-living energy use study measure calorie burn normal home condition 7 day - Fat muscle biopsy - Dietary intervention : Measurements food intake energy loss 6-week overfeeding ( 1.5 time subject normal food intake ) weight loss ( one-half subject normal food intake ) program Followup procedures inpatient stay : - Height weight measurement 6 month ( overfeed study participant ) monthly first year , 3-month interval second year , yearly 3 year ( weight loss study participant ) - Yearly visit ( 2-night inpatient stay ) participants repeat meal test , DXA , oral glucose tolerance test , behavioral questionnaire , woman become pregnant , pregnancy test</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Weight Gain Weight Loss Associated With Overeating Fasting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For obese individual , lose weight keep extremely difficult , whereas individual thin report trouble gain weight . In weight loss overfeed study large variation amount weight lose gain , clear whether individual response intervention predict . Measurement amount energy individual use 24 hour ( 24 hour energy expenditure 24-EE ) response 24-EE overfeed fasting may help predict individual great change weight change energy balance . In previous work , 24-EE response overfeed fasting related individual great increase 24-EE upon overfeed tended small decrease 24-EE upon fast ( spendthrift phenotype ) individual less increase 24-EE overfeed great decrease 24-EE fasting ( thrifty phenotype ) . Those spendthrift phenotype great increase 24-EE response overfeed gain less weight time . Furthermore , study show diet low protein content may magnify variability response overfeed . The aim study determine phenotype define 24-EE response overfeed underfeeding related weight loss gain 4 different under- overfeeding setting : inpatient weight loss group obese individual administer one two diet base 50 % reduction daily energy need six week ( standard reduction diet calorie reduce diet still high protein ; 6 week weight reduction , 10 week stay , n=20/standard reduction diet group n=10/relative high protein diet ) , two overfeed group lean , weight gain resistant individual : low-protein overfeed group 150 % daily energy need 6 week overfeed ( 6 % protein , 64 % carbohydrate , 30 % fat ; 10 week stay , n=10 ) , normal protein overfeed group 150 % daily energy need 6 week overfeed ( 20 % protein , 50 % carbohydrate , 30 % fat ; 10 week stay , n=10 ) . We also examine additional metabolic behavioral measurement determine relate weight change change 24-EE . These include sympathetic nervous system activity , behavior , adipose muscle tissue energy content , abdominal adipocyte size . The study evaluate relationship percent increase 24-EE response overfeeding/underfeeding amount weight change time subject . These finding may provide important information predict adapt specific individualized intervention obesity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : BMI great equal 27 kg/m ( 2 ) weight loss protocol body weight less 350 pound accommodate DXA scanner . BMI le equal 24 kg/m ( 2 ) ( BMI great equal 18.5 kg/m ( 2 ) overfeeding protocol . A history low BMI difficulty gain weight . Age 1860 year , minimize potential comorbid condition may indirectly affect EE . Minors age 18 exclude growth pubertal issue significant parameter could affect outcome also time requirement study would interfere school schedule . Women postmenopausal exclude study change metabolism could affect baseline measurement hypothesize predict weight change . Healthy , determine medical history , physical examination , laboratory test EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Current smoking Type 2 diabetes ( accord World Health Organization diagnostic criterion ) Impaired glucose tolerance ( accord World Health Organization diagnostic criterion ) participate overfeed study arm Endocrine disorder ( Cushing Disease , pituitary disorder , hypo hyperthyroidism ) Chronic pulmonary disorder , include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would limit ability follow protocol ( investigator judgment ) obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ; subject mild exerciseinduced asthma medication betaadrenergic agonist ( albuterol ) allow enter study ( provide use agent require one week study entry ) . Cardiovascular disease ( coronary heart disease , heart failure , arrhythmia , peripheral artery disease ) Hypertension ( blood pressure measurement high 140/90 mm Hg ( overfeed study ) 160/95 ( weight loss study ) two occasion use antihypertensive medication ) Diagnosed gastrointestinal disease , include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn disease ulcerative colitis ) , malabsorption syndrome ( e.g. , celiac disease ) , gastric ulcer ( active ) ; subject gastroesophageal reflux allow enter study Presence pacemaker implantable devices/shrapnel may interfere MRI CorTemp measurement Liver disease ( cirrhosis , active hepatitis B C , AST ALT great equal 1.5 time normal ) Renal disease ( serum creatinine concentration great equal 1.5 mg/dl and/or overt proteinuria ) Central nervous system disease ( cerebrovascular accident , dementia , neurodegenerative disorder ) Cancer require treatment past five year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer clearly cured opinion investigator carry excellent prognosis ( e.g. , Stage 1 cervical cancer ) Alcohol ( 3 drink per day ) and/or drug abuse ( amphetamine , cocaine , heroin , marijuana ) Current past history : bipolar disorder , schizophrenia presence psychotic symptom , bulimia nervosa anorexia nervosa , current major depressive disorder Pregnancy lactation Taking weight loss medication Weight change plus minus 5 % last 3 month Conditions specifically mention may serve criterion exclusion discretion investigator . Additionally , potential subject might exclude demonstrate style interpersonal relationship would inhibit successful completion study .</criteria>
