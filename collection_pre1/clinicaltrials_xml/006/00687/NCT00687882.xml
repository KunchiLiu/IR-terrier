	<brief_summary>The Kids-DOTT trial randomize controlled clinical trial whose primary objective evaluate non-inferiority shortened-duration ( 6 week ) versus conventional-duration ( 3 month ) anticoagulation child first-episode acute venous thrombosis . The first stage trial consist pilot/feasibility component , continue definitively-powered trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Duration Therapy Thrombosis Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children ( birth 21 year age , inclusive ) first-episode venous thrombosis association reversible clinical trigger ( key exclusion : history cancer ; severe thrombophilia state disclose ) enrol prescribed anticoagulation accord clinical standard care American College Physicians ( Chest journal ) 2012 recommendation . At 6 week ( post-diagnosis ) follow-up visit , repeat radiologic imaging perform determine residual thrombus burden degree occlusion . In addition , subject antiphospholipid antibody ( APA ) disclose enrollment undergo repeat APA testing . Patients residual occlusive thrombosis persistent APA exclude randomization , follow parallel cohort arm ( observational ) , conventional anticoagulation duration . All patient randomize total anticoagulant duration 6 week versus 3 month . Children follow primary efficacy endpoint symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) primary safety endpoint clinically-relevant bleeding ( major plus clinically-relevant non-major , per International Society Thrombosis Haemostasis Scientific Standardization Committee [ Journal Thrombosis &amp; Haemostasis ] 2012 definitions/recommendations ) . Children follow 2 year ( primary endpoint 1 year ) . Those deep venous thromboses affect venous return limb also undergo standardized post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) outcome assessment use Manco-Johnson pediatric PTS instrument . The non-inferiority analysis use bivariate endpoint approach , model inherent clinical trade-off risk recurrent VTE bleeding . The trial enroll 750 child across 40 participate center , allow 25 % rate exclusion per-protocol population due randomization non-eligibility ( i.e . parallel cohort ) , withdrawal/loss follow-up , protocol non-adherence . A sub-study , complete late 2013 , use investigational dalteparin lieu formulary low molecular weight heparin ( typically enoxaparin ) child clinically prescribe low molecular weight heparin sub-acute anticoagulation . The goal sub-study report dose-finding outcome data child treat dalteparin VTE . Outcomes patient qualitatively compare patient receive enoxaparin , warfarin , anticoagulants sub-acute anticoagulation . This portion study industry-sponsored investigator-initiated sub-study investigator-held IND . Since closure sub-study , overall Kids-DOTT study longer conduct Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application . Principal aims hypothesis : Specific Aim # 1 : To evaluate efficacy safety shortened-duration ( 6 week total ) versus conventional-duration ( 3 month total ) anticoagulation first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis among child thrombus resolution/non-occlusion ( i.e . establish blood flow ) evident initial 6 week anticoagulant therapy Hypothesis : Among child first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis thrombosis resolve non-occlusive six week follow-up , shorten duration anticoagulation ( total six week ; i.e . therapy ) non-inferior efficacy conventional duration ( total three month ) anticoagulation respect risk symptomatic recurrent VTE 1 year , superior safety respect risk clinically-relevant bleeding . ( The hypothesis also test secondary analysis 2 year , use efficacy safety outcomes 1 year primary analysis . ) Specific Aim # 2 : To determine whether outcomes first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis ( specifically , respect recurrent VTE PTS ) among child treat conventional-duration ( 3 month total ) anticoagulation differ without thrombus resolution/non-occlusion 6 week . Hypothesis : Among child first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis treat conventional-duration ( 3 month total ) anticoagulation , cumulative incidence recurrent VTE PTS significantly low among thrombus resolution/non-occlusion , versus , evident initial 6 week anticoagulant therapy . Specific Aim # 3 : To evaluate whether effect treatment duration risk symptomatic recurrent VTE clinically-relevant bleed child first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis differs subgroup define type sub-acute anticoagulant therapy real-world clinical use ( prescribe clinically , exception investigational dalteparin , prescribe investigator-held IND December 2013 ) . Hypothesis : Among child first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis , effect treatment duration risk symptomatic recurrent VTE clinically-relevant bleeding differ among subgroup treat sub-acutely enoxaparin , dalteparin , fondaparinux , warfarin , oral direct factor Xa inhibitor , oral direct thrombin inhibitor inhibitor . Specific Aim # 4 : To establish clinical trial-derived plasma nucleic acid biorepository future proteomic , genomic , metabolomic investigation predictor modulators VTE outcomes child . Exploratory Aim : To investigate whether duration anticoagulation ( range 3 month indefinite duration , determine clinically routine care ) influence risks symptomatic recurrent VTE clinically-relevant bleeding among child first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis persistent antiphospholipid antibody positivity evident 6 12 week post-diagnosis . Exploratory Hypothesis : Among child first-episode , provoke , acute venous thrombosis persistent antiphospholipid antibody positivity evident 6 12 week post-diagnosis , duration anticoagulant therapy predictor symptomatic recurrent VTE directly relate risk clinically-relevant bleeding..</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Children ( birth &lt; 21 year age ) radiologicallyconfirmed acute venous thrombosis past 30 day 2 . In opinion investigator , venous thrombosis provoke ( i.e. , nonspontaneous ) event ( e.g . : hospitalization ; Central venous catheterization ; infection ; dehydration ; surgery ; trauma ; immobility ; use estrogencontaining oral contraceptive pill ; flare autoimmune/rheumatologic condition ) . 1. prior episode VTE ; 2. presence history cancer ; 3. systemic lupus erythematosus 4. know pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , except limited peripheral cavitary lesion represent septic embolus ; ( N.B . image PE base upon clinical signs/symptoms , study procedure requirement ) 5 .

Moderate/severe anticoagulant deficiency define one following : 1. protein C &lt; 20 IU/dL patient ≥3 month age , protein C low limit detection patient &lt; 3 month age ; 2. antithrombin &lt; 30 IU/dL patient ≥3 month age , antithrombin low limit detection patient &lt; 3 month age ; 3. protein S ( free antigen activity ) &lt; 20 IU/dL .</criteria>
