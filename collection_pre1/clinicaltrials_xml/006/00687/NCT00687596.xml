	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether TAC-101 second line therapy patient receive Sorafenib first line therapy effective slow tumor activity patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma . The study also look safety TAC-101 follow treatment Sorafenib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study TAC-101 Second Line Treatment Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who Received Sorafenib First Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) treatable surgical approach locoregional therapy hepatic artery hemoembolization radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) effective control localized tumor . Currently market systemic chemotherapy agent , exception sorafenib , provide marginal benefit . Despite demonstrated survival benefit sorafenib , still imperative improve effectiveness systemic therapy patient population . Studies TAC-101 , synthetic retinoid , indicate although TAC-101 may induce tumor regression , appear stabilize effect , prolong survival expect historically . This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled international , multicenter study design evaluate efficacy safety TAC 101 second line treatment patient advance HCC follow treatment sorafenib first-line therapy . Sorafenib recently approve first line treatment HCC EU US expect become standard care first-line treatment advance HCC . Aside best supportive care , second line therapy available HCC . It hypothesize TAC 101 treatment extend Overall Survival ( OS ) discontinuation sorafenib .</detailed_description>
