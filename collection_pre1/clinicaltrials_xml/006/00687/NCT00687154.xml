	<brief_summary>The development worsen macular edema follow full scatter photocoagulation well recognize occurrence . However , limited literature regard . The purpose study determine incidence extent macular edema follow scatter laser photocoagulation surgery use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) eye without macular edema prior scatter laser photocoagulation explore whether incidence extent macular edema varies accord number sitting include treatment regimen . Study eye receive one two type scatter photocoagulation result compare use OCT photography image , well visual acuity testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study DME Following Scatter Laser Photocoagulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study eye receive scatter photocoagulation give one follow two regimen . To reduce selection bias , investigator require , prior study initiation , indicate treatment ( 1 PRP sit 4 PRP sitting ) administer . Only select treatment perform give investigator study eye . - 1 sit minimum 1200 maximum 1600 burn , one burn width separation burn scatter extend peripheral arcade beyond equator . - 4 sitting , separate four week ( +4 day ) , approximately 300 burn first two sitting investigator judgment number burn third fourth sitting long total four sitting 1200 1600 burn . Both regimen conform usual clinical practice . The study aim enroll 150 eye . At least 40 eye enrol prior focal laser photocoagulation least 40 eye without prior focal laser treatment . After enrollment 80 eye ( 40 prior treatment 40 without prior treatment ) , interim analysis conduct focused enrollment strategy implement analysis suggest subject subgroup enter . Approximately half eye receive scatter treatment regimen . The following procedure do study eye baseline schedule visit ( except 8 12 week exam data collect ) unless otherwise specify : - OCT - E-ETDRS visual acuity eye ( refraction study eye baseline , 17 week , 34 week ) - Fundus photograph ( 7-fields baseline 3-fields 34 week ) - Photographs document scatter photocoagulation ( day first PRP sit )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible , follow inclusion ( 14 ) exclusion criterion ( 58 ) must meet : 1 . Age &gt; = 18 year • Patients &lt; 18 year old include would insufficient number patient &lt; 18 year old would meet eligibility criterion study order able generalize result patient &lt; 18 year old provide informative data effect treatment age group . 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) • Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : 1 . Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes 2 . Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes 3 . Documented diabetes ADA and/or WHO criteria 3 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion list section 2.2.2 . 4 . Able willing provide inform consent . A patient eligible follow exclusion criterion ( 58 ) present : 5 . History chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 6 . History pancreatic transplant . 7 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . • Patients poor glycemic control , within last 4 month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 4 month enrol . 8 . Patient expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center next 8 month . The patient must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion ( ad ) none exclusion criterion ( ek ) list . A patient one study eye . If eye eligible , investigator his/her discretion select one study eye . The eligibility criterion study eye follow : Inclusion 1 . Presence early proliferative severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy investigator intend perform full scatter photocoagulation either one sit four sitting . 2 . Central subfield thickness OCT ≤ 299 micron . Note : Clinically significant macular edema exclusion provide central subfield ≤299 micron . 3 . Visual acuity 73 letter great ( 20/32 well ) . 4 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , patient cooperation sufficient administer full scatter photocoagulation obtain adequate fundus photograph OCT. Exclusion 5 . Prior scatter photocoagulation . 6 . High risk ( severe proliferative ) retinopathy . 7 . Presence ocular condition ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might produce macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , IrvineGass Syndrome , significant vitreomacular interface disease , etc. ) . 8 . Treatment diabetic macular edema plan . 9 . History treatment DME within prior 6 month , include focal/grid macular photocoagulation corticosteroid route . 10 . History major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , vitrectomy , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 6 month anticipate within next 8 month follow enrollment . 11 . History YAG capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior enrollment .</criteria>
