	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine healthy volunteer whether certain anti-HIV medication ( lopinavir/ritonavir efavirenz ) affect drug level certain anti-malarial medication ( artesunate/ amodiaquine artemether/ lumefantrine ) vice versa . Since drug degrade use overlap pathway liver , predict change drug level overall drug exposure observe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV malaria two pernicious disease face develop country . Malaria affect 300 500 million individual annually develop country estimate 25.8 million people Africa live HIV . Current therapy recommend World Health Organization include use artemisinin derivative , artesunate artemether . To minimize risk resistance , drug use combination old drug longer half-lives include amodiaquine lumefantrine . Treatment malaria complicate increase availability antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication HIV clinically important drug-drug interaction may occur co-infected patient . Protease inhibitor ( e.g . lopinavir ritonavir ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase ( e.g . efavirenz ) base treatment commonly affect pharmacokinetic exposure drug metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) metabolic pathway . Artemether metabolize CYP3A4 active dihydroartemisinin ( DHA ) , artesunate hydrolyze DHA . Lumefantrine active compound metabolize CYP3A4 . Amodiaquine active `` prodrug '' quickly metabolize active metabolite N-desethylamodiaquine ( DEAQ ) CYP2C8 . In addition , antimalarial drug may also affect metabolism CYP substrates , ARVs . The primary objective study investigate effect ARV agent ( ritonavir/ lopinavir ( Kaletra ) efavirenz ) pharmacokinetics antimalarial drug combination [ artesunate/ amodiaquine active metabolite , artemether/ lumefantrine ( Coartem® ) active metabolite ] . The secondary objective investigate effect antimalarial drug combination [ artesunate/amodiaquine artemether/lumefantrine ( Coartem® ) ] pharmacokinetics ARV drug [ lopinavir/ritonavir ( Kaletra® ) efavirenz ] . If clinically important interaction occur , net effect may include improve diminished antimalarial activity ( activity attribute parent drug active metabolite ( ) ) drug toxicity . The study HIV negative healthy volunteer allow rapid assessment potential interaction provide essential data optimize future clinical study use ARVs antimalarial child adult Uganda . Currently component study involve impact ARVs artesunate/amodiaquine pursue ( recruitment arm conduct separately ) , two group presently-approved trial : one effect lopinavir/ritonavir artemether/lumefantrine study another effect efavirenz artemether/lumefantrine study .</detailed_description>
