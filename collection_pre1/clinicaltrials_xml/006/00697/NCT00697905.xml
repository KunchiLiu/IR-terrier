	<brief_summary>The aim study assess gemcitabine combination carboplatin 1st line chemotherapy patient metastatic recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma reasonable efficacy favourable toxicity profile warrant comparative study . A parallel group randomly select patient equal number carboplatin gemcitabine combination arm treat cisplatin 5-FU combination chemotherapy ( active control arm ) . The hypothesis combination chemotherapy least active less toxic reference regimen cisplatin combination 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Gemcitabine Carboplatin Metastatic Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>52 patient metastatic recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol trial . After initial screening , patient attend clinic baseline examination . Subjects randomly allocate carboplatin gemcitabine cisplatin 5-FU combination ratio 1:1 . Study visit occur depend arm patient . An economic evaluation cost benefit gemcitabine-carboplatin implement within protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent obtain patient parents/guardian . 2 . Subject age great equal 18 year 3 . Histologically proven recurrent metastatic undifferentiated squamous nasopharyngeal carcinoma , amenable local therapy . 4 . Measurable disease distant sit and/or locoregional site define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record &gt; =10mm CT scan MRI . Tumour lesion situate previously irradiate field measurable tissue plane preserve CT MRI ) . 5 . Prior concurrent chemotherapy radiation therapy permit . 6 . Primary chemoradiotherapy must complete least 6 month prior study entry . 7 . Life expectancy 3 month . 8 . ECOG performance status less equal 2 . 9 . Patients must normal organ marrow function follow : White blood cell count : &gt; = 3.0 x 10^9/L Absolute neutrophil count : &gt; = 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets : &gt; = 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin : within normal limit AST/ALT/ALP : &lt; = 2.5 x upper limit normal Creatinine clearance estimate GFR : &gt; =50 mls/min . Patients follow eligible enrollment study : 1 . Pregnant woman exclude study gemcitabine potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother gemcitabine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated gemcitabine . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 2 . Women childbearing potential men without adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 3 . Prior use gemcitabine 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition gemcitabine carboplatin . 5 . Prior line chemotherapy metastatic NPC 6 . Prior radiotherapy indicator lesion ( ) measure study . 7 . Patients receive investigational agent 8 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 9 . Patients boneonly metastasis . 10 . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( e.g . congestive cardiac failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease cardiac arrhythmia well controlled medication ) myocardial infarction within last 12 month . 11 . Severe sensorineural hearing loss affect normal daily activity require use hearing aid . 12 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 13 . Patients immune deficiency . They increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . 14 . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy . There possible pharmacokinetic interaction antiretroviral gemcitabine agent administer study . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
