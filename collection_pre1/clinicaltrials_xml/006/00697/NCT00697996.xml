	<brief_title>Rituximab Pediatric Renal Transplant Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty kidney transplant recipient care Stanford University UCLA age 2-21 , consider participation research acute rejection episode . After biopsy do diagnosis acute rejection make , ten patient randomly enrol group treat Rituximab steroid pulse . Ten child enrol control group , receive standard care acute transplant rejection . Assignment base 1:1 randomization scheme . That mean two patient assign group patient receive steroid pulse 4 dos Rituximab . The third patient would assign group receive steroid pulse adjustment immunosuppression medication standard care Stanford University . The dose Rituximab give 375 mg/m2 administer IV . Additional dose Rituximab administer weekly basis . A total four dos give . If acute rejection resolve one-week , patient group option receive polyclonal antibody therapy .</detailed_description>
