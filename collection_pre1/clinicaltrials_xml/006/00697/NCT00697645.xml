	<brief_summary>This study determine safety efficacy transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) treat acute ischemic stroke ( stroke result blood clot brain ) . TMS find effective safe set depression . TMS act generate magnetic field brain simulate neuro-chemical change stimulate neuronal activity translate increase secretion growth factor brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . This follow positive effect growth survival factor neuronal sprouting , re-organization also potentially neurogenesis . Hence postulate TMS positive effect recovery rate extent recovery stroke . Brainsway innovative project involve development use deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation humans treat host behavioral disorder , include depression addiction . Brainsway develop novel coil design stimulation deep structure human brain conduct several safety efficacy study recently complete large study ( 70 subject ) demonstrate effectiveness depressive patient . Deep TMS produce direct electromagnetic field induce excitation inhibition neuron deep inside brain . The treatment non-invasive , significant side effect , need hospitalization anesthesia . Consistent animal study use brain stimulation deep TMS prefrontal cortex find exert potent antidepressant effect patient previously responsive antidepressant drug two different study . Therefore , expect TMS also safe patient stroke . Patients 18 80 year age mild moderate acute stroke may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , rating neurological deficit cognition deficit problem walk result stroke , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance ( MRI ) scan head . CT involve use specialized X-rays MRI involve magnetic field obtain image brain . All participant receive standard medical rehabilitation therapy stroke . In addition , patient recruit study receive x session TMS Brainsway device deliver motor strip affect hemisphere . Each session last minute . Sessions begin day 3 stroke onset give alternate day basis 14 day ( 7 treatment ) . Patients monitor daily discharge hospital , day 17 , whichever early . Assessments include physical examination safety evaluation include blood test MRI CT scan evaluate response treatment side effect need . Patients return follow-up examination 30 90 day treatment conclusion evaluate recovery rate functional status .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must meet inclusion criterion . 1 . Diagnosis acute ischemic stroke define measurable neurological deficit sudden onset , presume secondary focal cerebral ischemia . 2 . Disabling neurological deficit attributable acute ischemic stroke . 3 . NIHSS le equal 18 leave hemisphere stroke , NIHSS le equal 16 others . 4 . A score least 3 item 6 NIHSS ( motor score leg ) pretreatment . 5 . Age 1885 year , inclusive . 6 . Able sign inform consent . Patients exclude study participation follow reason : 1 . Current participation another study investigational drug device within , prior participation present study , plan participation another therapeutic trial , prior final ( day 90 ) assessment trial . 2 . Symptoms suggestive subarachnoid hemorrhage , even CT MRI scan negative hemorrhage . 3 . Women know pregnant , lactate positive indeterminate pregnancy test . 4 . Neurological deficit lead stupor coma ( NIHSS level consciousness [ item I ] score great equal 2 ) . 5 . Minor stroke nondisabling deficit rapidly improve neurological symptom . 6 . Baseline NIHSS great 18 leave hemisphere stroke great 16 others . 7 . Evidence acute chronic ICH head CT MRI . 8 . CT MRI evidence nonvascular cause neurological symptom . 9 . Signs mass effect cause shift midline structure CT MRI . 10 . Any intracranial surgery , intraspinal surgery , serious head trauma ( head injury require hospitalization ) within past 3 month . 11 . Stroke within past 3 month . 12 . Presence history intracranial neoplasm ( except small meningioma ) arteriovenous malformation . 13 . Intracranial aneurysm , unless surgically endovascularly treat 3 month . 14 . Seizure onset stroke history epilepsy . 15 . Life expectancy le 3 month . 16 . Other serious illness , e.g. , severe hepatic , cardiac , renal failure ; acute myocardial infarction ; complex disease may confound treatment assessment . 17 . Treatment qualify stroke thrombolytic , antithrombotic GPIIbIIIa inhibitor outside protocol .</criteria>
