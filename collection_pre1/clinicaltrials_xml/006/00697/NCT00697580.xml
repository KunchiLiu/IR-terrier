	<brief_summary>We conduct intervention study examine effect 16-week exercise diet intervention prevention disease , specifically type 2 diabetes heart disease , Latino youth . Eighty overweight Latino boy girl recruit place one follow intervention group : 1 ) Control Group ( delay intervention ) , 2 ) Dietary Education Group ( nutrition education focus reduce sugar &amp; soda , increase fiber &amp; whole grain intake ) , 3 ) Combination Strength Training ( twice/week 60 min , progressive increase exercise volume intensity ) + Dietary Education ( nutrition education focus reduce sugar &amp; soda , increase fiber &amp; whole grain intake ) 4 ) Combination Circuit Training ( twice/week 60 min , aerobic + strength training exercise ) + Dietary Education ( ) . We assess intervention group effect health parameter weight , body composition , insulin related measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall historical goal grant examine determinant insulin resistance child , especially role total fat visceral fat pubertal development `` high risk '' minority child . Our previous longitudinal work provide platform propose new intervention phase research . This new emphasis justify base magnitude pediatric obesity problem , particularly susceptible ethnic group , need design test novel intervention reduce obesity , profound insulin resistance observe overweight minority child . Insulin resistance think central ( perhaps causative ) several metabolic abnormality associate type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . Thus , intervention aim improve insulin resistance susceptible child could effective mean primary prevention type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . The overall objective proposal therefore conduct randomize control study examine effect 16-week exercise diet intervention insulin sensitivity , insulin secretion , beta-cell function , body fat distribution . Overweight Hispanic boys girl ( n=80 ) recruit randomized one follow intervention : Ø Control ( delay intervention ) Ø Modification carbohydrate intake ( reduce sugar &amp; soda , increase fiber &amp; whole grain intake ) use individualize healthy exchange system motivational interviewing Ø Strength training + modification carbohydrate intake Ø Circuit Training + modification carbohydrate intake This study provide new information effect intervention primary outcome level body composition ( total lean fat mass , visceral fat , intramyocellular fat liver fat ) insulin relate measure ( insulin secretion &amp; sensitivity beta-cell function ) . The hypothesis : 1 . All intervention separate independent effect improve insulin resistance 2 . Strength train improve insulin resistance re-distribution body fat ( low visceral fat , intramyocellular lipid liver fat ) 3 . Carbohydrate modification improve insulin secretion beta-cell function 4 . Circuit train similar improvement insulin resistance improvement adiposity compare strength train group . 5 . The aforementioned effect insulin dynamic independent effect either intervention weight loss loss whole body fat . The overall rationale intervention base three main factor . First , preliminary data present overweight Hispanic boy show 16-weeks strength training significantly improve insulin sensitivity absence reduction total body fat absence dietary intervention . Second , preliminary data suggests overweight Hispanic child consume high level simple sugar , low level fiber complex carbohydrate , data literature suggest modification carbohydrate consumption ( reduce sugar , increase fiber &amp; whole grain ) improve glucose control independent body composition . Third provide new preliminary data show dietary variable associate insulin dynamic overweight Hispanic child high sugar intake associate poor beta-cell function . We choose focus Hispanic child understudied , high-risk population , display significant obesity-related metabolic abnormality probably emanate profound insulin resistance ( see preliminary data ) . In support feasibility proposal , develop extensive expertise recruit retain research volunteer large Hispanic population East Los Angeles , experience multi-disciplinary group investigator , University Southern California necessary clinical research infrastructure tackle project . If hypothesis bear , provide evidence incorporation strength training specific individualized dietary recommendation prevention management obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular risk overweight Hispanic youth .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Overweight ( age &amp; sexspecific body mass index ≥ 85th percentile base CDC BMI growth chart [ US Department Health Human Services , 2000 ] , calculate Epi Info Software , version 3.3 ) Latino ( sets grandparent must Latino heritage defined selfreport ; limited Latinos maintain homogeneous sample Latinos increase risk insulin resistance type 2 diabetes . ) If participant parent unsure country origin 4 grandparent exclude study . The participant family ask whether grandparent undocumented immigrant . Presently take medication ( ) diagnose syndrome disease could influence dietary intake , exercise ability , body composition fat distribution , insulin action secretion . Previously diagnose major illness since birth ( e.g . severe intrauterine growth retardation , chronic birth asphyxia , cancer ) . Children eligible participation diagnostic criterion diabetes include polyuria , polydipsia without unexplained weight loss , fast plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl , 2hour plasma glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL oral glucose tolerance test . Children also exclude test positive diabetesrelated autoantibody , include ICA512 GAD . Children test positive type 2 diabetes refer treatment . Children impair glucose tolerance ( fast glucose &gt; 110 mg/dL 2hour glucose &gt; 140 mg/dl OGTT ) and/or condition associate insulin resistance ( e.g . acanthosis nigricans , hypertension , dyslipidemia , PCOS ) eligible , long receive treatment meet eligibility criterion . Participants involve weight training , exercise , nutrition , weight loss program past 6 month . Participants follow rule guideline appropriate conduct participation , i.e. , disruptive behavior , derogatory racist comment , act physical violence towards study staff participant , use illegal substance . The principal investigator Dr. Michael Goran decide conduct warrant exclusion removal study . Pregnancy test come positive . Children live 20 mile away General Clinic Research Center ( GCRC ) . We terminate participation child fail follow rule guideline appropriate behavior conduct participation .</criteria>
