	<brief_summary>SOS four-arm randomize control study way increase screen colorectal cancer . About 40-50 % people age 50 old date screening . This important problem screening prevents colorectal cancer decrease colon cancer death . We study 3 different level support help people get screen follow-up positive screening test . These involve compare usual care stepwise increase intensity approach ; automate approach mail information home screening test , plus phone assistance medical assistant , plus phone counseling care management . We also compare nurse assist follow-up positive screen test compare usual care By study hope increase colon cancer screen rate , also follow-up rate positive screening test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systems Support ( SOS ) Increase Colon Cancer Screening Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systems Support ( SOS ) Increase Colon Cancer Screening Follow-up A . Specific Aims There strong evidence colorectal cancer screening ( CRCS ) decrease colorectal cancer ( CRC ) mortality reduces colorectal cancer incidence . Despite efficacy screening , 40-60 % eligible adult screen recommended interval , many never type CRCS . Screening failure occur lack screening also breakdowns follow-up positive test , obviate benefit screen . Strategies improve uptake CRCS typically focus either patient health care provider , without describe infrastructure change , system support ( SOS ) , require implement sustain change . We propose two-part study use Chronic Care Model organize SOS . We identify cohort Group Health patient age 50 -73 year colonoscopy ( CS ) 10 year , flexible sigmoidoscopy ( FS ) 5 year , fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) 10 month . Part One : Subjects randomize receive one four intervention stepwise increase intensity support . 1 . Usual care ( UC ) . 2 . Automated ( UC+ mail information , access cancer screen hotline , mail FOBT card , reminder card ) . 3 . Assisted ( UC + automate + medical assistant ) document screen intent assist patient via resource already supply send request patient 's physician . 4 . Care management ( UC + automate + assist + cancer screen nurse support ) counsel patient assist screen plan ( assess procedural risk , order test ) . Part Two : Patients positive FOBT positive FS ( CS need ) randomize one two follow-up intervention arm : A . Usual care ( Group Health include registry physician alert ) B . Care Management ( UC + cancer screen nurse manages care positive test ) . Our study hypotheses increase level SOS result increase CRCS rate , care management cancer screen nurse increase follow-up rate positive test . The primary specific aim : 1 . To compare effectiveness intervention condition increase CRCS rate . 2 . To compare effectiveness intervention condition follow-up positive screen test . The secondary aim : 3 . To assess effect intervention condition participant ' cognitive , affective , social factor related CRCS adherence satisfaction medical service 4 . To compare utilization , cost , incremental cost-effectiveness intervention condition .</detailed_description>
