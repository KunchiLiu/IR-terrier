	<brief_summary>This study compare level p11 protein people without major depressive disorder ( MDD ) examine p11 level patient affect treatment citalopram ( Celexa ) . Healthy normal volunteer patient chronic recurrent major depression 18 65 year age may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Healthy Volunteers - Psychiatric interview medical examination , question family history - Blood draw Patients MDD Phase 1 - Evaluation Discontinuation Medications - Physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood test - Gradual antidepressant medication withdrawal , follow 2- 6-week drug-free period . If need , medicine anxiety difficulty sleeping may prescribe . Phase 2 Citalopram Treatment - Start daily citalopram treatment - Evaluations start phase 2 every week 8 week follow procedure : - Symptoms rating interview questionnaires - Review side effect new medication - Blood pressure pulse measurement - Blood urine test At end study , plan developed long-term treatment transfer care patient physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) serious , debilitate , life-shortening illness affect many person age background . While treatment effective significant portion patient MDD , progress develop effective treatment lag . Furthermore , regard exist antidepressant medication , yet reliable predictor likelihood remission , response non-response initial trial antidepressant medication . Identifying factor likely predict response would advantage personalize treatment particular individual ; select antidepressant medication likely give great probability favorable outcome . The serotonin system implicate pathophysiology depression mechanism action exist effective antidepressant treatment . Fourteen different serotonin receptor identify date . One , 5-HT1B , play important role regulate serotonin neurotransmission . Recently , p11 ( member S100 family protein ) find interact 5-HT1B receptor ( Svenningsson et al 2006 ; Svenningsson Greengard 2007 ) . p11 mRNA level markedly reduce forebrain helpless H/Rouen mouse level p11 mRNA down-regulated anterior cingulate cortex depress patient . p11 mRNA distribute anatomical pattern closely resemble 5-HT1B receptor mRNA , include cortex , hippocampus , hypothalamus raphe nucleus . Chronic administration antidepressant imipramine , tranylcypromine , citalopram significantly increase level p11 cortex . Finally , find chronic treatment fluoxetine increase p11 peripheral mononuclear cell monkey . We study whether blood cell level p11 differ healthy individual patient suffer unipolar depression . Moreover , study whether level p11 affect treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram . Complementary work continue laboratory well characterize role p11 pathophysiology depression ( e.g. , animal study , post-mortem study ) . In addition , also acquire battery magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan subset 45 homogeneous depressed subject , 45 match healthy control baseline 8 week . There grow body evidence implicate morphometric physiologic abnormality , measureable MRI , pathophysiology major depressive disorder . We assess baseline difference depressed subject healthy control , treatment effect , search possible MRI marker predict treatment response . This open label study perform National Institute Mental Health . In , 82 adult subject major depressive disorder , age 18 65 year , recruit community . In addition , perform p11 measurement blood cell 64 healthy control subject .</detailed_description>
