	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency widespread link decreased bone mineral content . Little data exists regard vitamin D status relationship 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25-OHD ) status functional bone health outcome Hispanic infant . To evaluate , plan observational cohort full term , healthy , exclusively breastfed Hispanic Caucasian infant . We hypothesize serum 25-OHD measure cord blood significantly low Hispanic Caucasian infant , 25-OHD less 20 ng/mL find least 50 % Hispanic neonate . Secondary aim evaluate relationship 25-OHD level bone mineral status baseline 3 month 400 IU/day supplemental vitamin D3 . Whole body bone density scan ( DXA ) bone ultrasound ( SOS U/S ) measure shortly birth , supplementation . Data study provide information need design randomize trial intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recent year , severe vitamin D deficiency resurface major public health concern . Nutritional rickets widespread , recent report disease Texas show Hispanic child increase risk . Long-term follow-up demonstrate vitamin D deficient infant likely decrease bone mineral status late childhood . Additionally , vitamin D deficiency link change fetal `` imprinting '' increase susceptibility autoimmune disease , immune deficiency , malignancy . At birth , infant 's vitamin D status entirely dependent vitamin D status mother . Many study show vitamin D deficiency common mother-child pair , especially dark-skinned individual . However , data exist regard vitamin D status Hispanic infant . Low milk intake decrease sun exposure urbanization make high-risk group among infant Texas . Potential subject identify study personnel labor delivery St. Luke 's Ben Taub Hospitals normal newborn nursery . The parent/guardian approached study explain full . A time question allow . Once parent/guardian agree his/her child 's participation , inform write consent form sign . Subject confidentiality maintain within limit law . All name personal information access investigator authorized personnel . There possibility coercion subject relationship dependency investigator . A cohort Hispanic Caucasian infant recruit follow . Other ethnic group exclude , analyze term primary outcome . Race ethnicity classify accord mother 's self classification . The intervention differ group . This study include 3 study visit : 1 . Baseline inpatient visit birth - hospitalize obtain consent , obtain cord blood sample , mother complete questionnaire 2 . 1 week initial hospital discharge - first outpatient visit obtain baseline data ( see ) start vitamin D drop 3 . At 3 mo life - second outpatient visit obtain final data ( see ) discontinue vitamin D drop Visit 1 ( Inpatient ) : After consent obtain upon birth , cord blood obtain analyzed use Diasorin RIA 25-OHD . In addition , serum ionized calcium intact parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) concentration measure cord blood . Mothers give brief questionnaire determine risk vitamin D deficiency ( take vitamin , supplement , sun exposure ) . Follow-up outpatient appointment schedule . Visit 2 ( First Outpatient Visit ) : Infants speed sound ultrasound ( SOS U/S ) whole body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) perform 1 week hospital discharge . Supplements 400 IU vitamin D per day provide infant free charge start time body composition analysis ( Vitamin D supplementation recommend American Academy Pediatrics infant exclusively breastfeed ) . Visit 3 ( Second Outpatient Visit ) : Infants return three month age repeat measurement serum 25-OHD , PTH , bone SOS U/S , whole body DXA perform . At time second brief questionnaire give mother assess risk vitamin D deficiency child . Vitamin D drop discontinue . Between visit , investigator call family check breast feeding status . At delivery , cord blood obtain analyzed 25-OHD , serum ionized calcium , intact parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) concentration . At three month age blood draw 25-OHD PTH . The purpose blood draw ass vitamin D status newborn infant . This primary aim study . - 5 cc ( one teaspoon ) cord blood obtain visit 1 , 5 cc ( one teaspoon ) blood drawn patient third visit ( three month age ) . - Total = 2 teaspoon There study cost pass subject 's family . Study investigation ( laboratory , bone mineral assessment ) pay researcher . Costs routine medical care , associate study , associate delivery hospitalization newly bear child responsibility family insurance company . A total 60 subject enrol protocol . Enrollment 30 Hispanic infant 30 Caucasian infant provide power &gt; 80 % demonstrate significantly low cord 25-OHD concentration Hispanic infant p &lt; 0.05 , primary outcome .</detailed_description>
