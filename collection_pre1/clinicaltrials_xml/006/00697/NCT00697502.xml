	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Patients TYMS 2R/2R 2R/3R appear sensitive fluoropyrimidines , confer high risk grade 3-4 fluoropyrimidine relate toxicity high response rate compare 3R/3R . The genotype 3R/3R common East Asia associate great tolerability fluoropyrimidine measure low toxicity also low response rate . As sensitivity fluoropyrimidine appear affected TYMS genotype , hypothesise patient TYMS 3R/3R tolerant standard dos capecitabine require high dos overcome fluoropyrimidine resistance . We design study develop TYMS genotype specific dose capecitabine . Aims : 1 . To determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) capecitabine twice day two week follow one week rest period ( intermittent schedule ) patient advanced/ metastatic cancer base TYMS genotype . 2 . To determine suitable phase II dose intermittent schedule capecitabine . 3 . To determine safety toxicity regimen . 4 . To perform plasma pharmacokinetics capecitabine . 5 . To determine relationship gene relevance fluoropyrimidine pathway pharmacokinetics toxicity .</brief_summary>
