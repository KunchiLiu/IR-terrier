	<brief_summary>Based current understanding Aicardi syndrome , condition hypothesize occur due genetic change X-chromosome . Our team investigate Aicardi syndrome identify specific gene location associate disorder . We collect blood skin biopsy sample patient parent . A permanent cell line prepare DNA blood skin sample cell line isolate used genetic testing . Our current research include microarray analysis use look duplication deletion genetic material , mutation analysis candidate gene sequence , review medical record identify trend suggest possible candidate gene interest , X chromosome inactivation study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Selected X-Linked Disorders : Aicardi Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aicardi syndrome sporadic X-linked dominant , presumably male-lethal , neurodevelopmental disorder . It initially characterize agenesis corpus callosum , neuronal migration defect , eye abnormality ( chorioretinal lacuna , colobomas optic nerve microphthalmia ) severe early-onset seizure neurodevelopmental delay . It well recognize brain abnormality , polymicrogyria , agyria , cyst heterotopias common feature Aicardi syndrome . We previously hypothesize gene cause Aicardi syndrome possibly additional phenotypically similar disorder X-linked inheritance , Goltz syndrome Focal Dermal Hypoplasia , near region chromosome Xp22 delete another condition name microphthalmia linear skin defect syndrome ( MLS ) , three clinical similarity . However , interim study show likely case mutation find Aicardi syndrome human holocytochrome c-type synthetase ( HCCS ) , gene delete mutated MLS . In addition , mouse model MLS feature Aicardi syndrome . Furthermore , identify mutation PORCN ( Xp11.3 ) Goltz syndrome patient , Aicardi syndrome patient . Therefore , likely mutate gene elsewhere X-chromosome . For study collect information patient clinical finding suggest diagnosis Aicardi syndrome , MLS syndrome condition phenotypically overlap disorder . A detailed family history obtain , indicate , additional family member evaluate appropriately obtain write voluntary consent . A detailed report history physical finding obtain refer physician patient identify outside facility , participant may evaluate study collaborator . Blood skin biopsy obtain affected individual , unaffected parent affect unaffected family member indicate . It anticipate severely affected patient expire ; case , ( post mortem ) pathological specimen may obtain . Occasionally , affected individual may undergo surgical procedure removal tissue ; case may obtain tissue would otherwise discard essential diagnostic study clinical care patient . It anticipate specimen extremely valuable understanding pathogenesis investigated condition . DNA , RNA protein prepare leukocyte tissue use mutation analysis molecular study identify gene . Permanent lymphoblastoid cell line prepare stored laboratory permanent source DNA molecular study .</detailed_description>
