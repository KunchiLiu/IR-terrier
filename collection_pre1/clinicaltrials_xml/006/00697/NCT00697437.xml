	<brief_title>Effect Ketoconazole Inhibition CYP3A Urinary Excretion Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : This follow-up protocol earlier study entitle `` A phase I study docetaxel ketoconazole modulation solid tumor '' ( PH14/01 ) show 2-fold reduction docetaxel clearance clear correlation renal function . Aims : The aim study confirm ketoconazole inhibition CYP3A activity change urinary excretion profile docetaxel . Methodology : This single-centre , crossover study . Ten patient ( calculated sample size =5 , α=0.05 , β=0.8 , difference means=5 % , within group standard deviation=3 ) accrue randomly assign receive docetaxel either 75mg/m2 q3w x 1 dose 70mg q3w x 1 dose ketoconazole 200mg bid x q3d cycle 1 chemotherapy . This follow 20-day washout period receive regimen docetaxel cycle 2 . Blood sample 5mls drawn time 0 , 0.5h , 1h , 1.5h , 3h , 4h , 6h 24h onset docetaxel infusion pharmacokinetics analysis . A 24-hour urine collection commence day docetaxel infusion require patient . All urine next 24 hour must collect return study coordinator Day 2 study cycle docetaxel analysis creatinine clearance determination . The amount docetaxel excrete patient without ketoconazole modulation determine LCMSMS method compare . Clinical Relevance : This ensure safe advocation dose-sparing strategy establish earlier study costly agent docetaxel confirm change excretion profile occur major route hepatic metabolism block .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable docetaxel indicate . 2 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . 3 . With exception alopecia , fatigue , nausea asthenia , patient must resolution acute toxic effect prior surgery ' radiotherapy chemotherapy National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 grade &lt; 1 . 4 . Patients must ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % ) . 5 . Patients must life expectancy great 3 month . 6 . Patients must normal renal marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/μl absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/μl platelet ≥ 100,000/μl haemoglobin ≥ 7g/dL creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal 7 . Patients abnormal liver function test ( AST/ALT ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit normal ; ALP ≤ 5x ULN ; total bilirubin ≤ 2x ULN ) eligible enrollment . 8 . Patients must adequate renal function ( serum creatinine within normal laboratory limit ) . 9 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior study enrollment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 10 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients rapidly progressive intracranial spinal metastatic disease ( include patient require corticosteroid CNS disease ) . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition docetaxel ketoconazole use study . 5 . Patients prior medication know metabolized induce/inhibit CYP3A4 within 1 week treatment cycle . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Pregnant woman exclude study docetaxel embryotoxic/fetotoxic potential abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother docetaxel , breastfeed discontinue mother treated docetaxel . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
