	<brief_title>Agonist Replacement Therapy Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine abuse dependence continue significant public health concern . The number Americans use cocaine past month , percentage 12th- , 10th- 8th-graders use cocaine past year , percentage treatment admission involve cocaine remain stable recent year . In 1996 , cocaine use cost society $ 45 billion due medical consequence , lose productivity crime . Because public-health concern cost associate abuse , identify pharmacotherapy cocaine dependence priority National Institute Drug Abuse ( N.I.D.A. ) . A pharmacological adjunct cocaine dependence yet identify . The result clinical trial suggest agonist replacement therapy ( e.g. , d-amphetamine ) may effective cocaine dependence . Because d-amphetamine reduces cocaine use , clinical finding use reference identify human laboratory procedure screen putative pharmacotherapies . Identifying procedure assess efficacy putative pharmacotherapies important human laboratory study conduct rapidly efficiently clinical trial . The present project two specific aim . The first specific aim demonstrate sensitivity predictive validity human laboratory procedure commonly use screen putative pharmacotherapies cocaine dependence . To accomplish aim , conduct two `` proof-of-concept '' study . We first demonstrate safety tolerability d-amphetamine-cocaine combination ( Exp . 1 ) . We demonstrate d-amphetamine maintenance attenuates reinforce effect cocaine ( Exp . 2 ) . The ability attenuate reinforce effect cocaine may important characteristic effective pharmacotherapy . The result study help elucidate optimal condition ( e.g. , dose ) d-amphetamine might expect effective . The second specific aim determine efficacy atomoxetine ( StratteraÂ® ) putative agonist replacement pharmacotherapy cocaine dependence . To accomplish aim , conduct two experiment determine effect cocaine atomoxetine maintenance . We first demonstrate safety tolerability atomoxetine-cocaine combination ( Exp . 3 ) . Finally , determine reinforce effect intranasal cocaine atomoxetine maintenance ( Exp . 4 ) . Atomoxetine , potent norepinephrine uptake blocker , choose study pharmacological behavioral effect overlap extent d-amphetamine , appear less abuse potential . Identifying novel agonist replacement therapy important clinician may reluctant use d-amphetamine abuse potential .</detailed_description>
