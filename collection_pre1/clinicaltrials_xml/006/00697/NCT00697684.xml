	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Conditioning With Clofarabine , Antithymocyte Globulin ( ATG ) , Total Lymphoid Irradiation ( TLI ) Followed Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One approach limit toxicity allogeneic transplantation use nonmyeloablative regimen precede infusion allogeneic cells.In strategy , patient receive immunosuppressive therapy allow engraftment donor cell without immediate eradication patient hematopoiesis.The primary mechanism underlie disease eradicate chemotherapy mediate cytoreduction , rather donor lymphocyte mediate graft versus tumor effect.As result , patient experience far less regimen relate toxicity.Therefore , adoption strategy may allow use allogeneic transplantation disease setting patient population readily applicable past . Over past several year , use nonmyeloablative transplant rapidly expanded.Several reduce intensity conditioning regimen develop include fludarabine cyclophosphamide ; fludarabine melphalan ; fludarabine , ATG low dose busulfan ; fludarabine low dose TBI . Investigators demonstrate feasibility treatment approach majority patient demonstrate donor engraftment , decrease regimen related toxicity , graft mediate regression disease.In study , patient demonstrate period mixed donor/host chimerism infusion donor lymphocytes associate achievement complete donor chimerism . Although regimen related toxicity decrease follow reduce intensive conditioning regimen , graft versus host disease opportunistic infection remain significant source morbidity mortality follow nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation . The impact nonmyeloablative transplantation immunological reconstitution fully define . Persistence host antigen present cell post-transplant period may increase incidence GVHD due presentation alloantigens donor T cell . In contrast , residual host cellular immunity may provide enhanced protection infectious pathogen allow rapid education donor lymphocytes . The use clofarabine place fludarabine combination cyclophosphamide may augment anti-leukemia effect regimen , enhance cytoreduction , increase efficacy reduce intensity allogeneic transplantation setting.A potential issue associate use clofarabine cyclophosphamide pre-transplant conditioning whether regimen would sufficiently immunosuppressive reliably facilitate engraftment donor hematopoiesis.Another concern relate significant incidence graft versus host disease remain major source morbidity mortality follow reduce intensity transplantation.The use TLI ATG study context allogeneic transplantation show effectively support engraftment animal model clinical trials.TLI show promote immune tolerance result decrease incidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) .It show decrease incidence rejection follow transplantation T cell deplete allograft.The conditioning regimen TLI cyclophosphamide result successful engraftment patient aplastic anemia . Regulatory T cell represent population T lymphocytes demonstrate immunosuppressive phenotype play important role prevention autoimmunity transplant rejection.Regulatory cell express inhibitory cytokine IL-10 TGFÎ² think suppress immune activation direct cell contact.Similar activate effector cell coexpress CD4 CD25.Regulatory T cell may identify high level CD25 expression presence CTLA-4 FOXP3.Regulatory T cell demonstrate minimal proliferation allogeneic stimuli inhibit third party mixed lymphocyte response . Increased presence regulatory T cell find tumor bed , drain lymph node , circulation patient malignancy inhibit host anti-tumor immune response . There increase interest evaluate role regulatory T cell mean inhibit graft versus host disease . In animal model , selective introduction regulatory T cell prevents development graft versus host disease without compromise immune reconstitution anti-tumor immunity . A variety strategy ex vivo expansion isolation regulatory T cell explore . A limiting factor similar pattern expression cell surface marker regulatory activate T cell population . iNKT cell represent another population immunomodulatory cell think essential generation tolerance.In pre-clinical model , TLI show modulate immune effector cell result increased level circulate regulatory T cell , prevent GVHD mismatch transplant setting.It think iNKT cell selectively preserve TLI polarize T cell towards inhibitory phenotype . In clinical study , 37 patient lymphoid malignancy acute leukemia underwent conditioning TLI administer 10 fraction 80cGy ATG.Only 2 patient develop acute GVHD despite observation graft versus disease effect.Of note , significant increase number donor CD4+ T cell express IL-4 observe suggest immune modulation result TLI/ATG polarize cell towards TH-2 phenotype.As , TLI/ATG would like facilitate engraftment decrease incidence GVHD patient undergo condition clofarabine.Most importantly , modulate host immune effector deplete donor T cell , strategy significantly inhibit graft versus tumor effect.The prevalence dendritic cell ( DC ) subset ( DC1 vs. DC2 ) hematopoietic graft also show effect risk GVHD .</detailed_description>
