	<brief_title>Study MLN8237 Participants With Advanced Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call alisertib . Alisertib test treat people advance hematological malignancy . This study determine dose-limiting toxicity , maximum tolerate dose , safety pharmacokinetics ( drug move body ) alisertib give twice day 7 21 day . This open label study enrol 58 patient . Participants enrol one 3 treatment group : - Part 1 : Powder-in-Capsule ( PIC ) Dose Escalation ( alisertib 25 mg PIC , orally twice daily [ BID ] Day 1 [ load dose ] alisertib 25 35 mg PIC daily [ QD ] 21 day ( D ) , alisertib 35 , 45 , 65 90 mg PIC , orally , QD 14D ) - Part 1 : Enteric-coated Tablet ( ECT ) Dose Escalation ( alisertib 40 mg , ECT , orally , QD 14D alisertib 30 , 40 50 mg , orally , BID 7D ) - Part 2 : Participants Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma ( PTCL ) ( alisertib 50 mg ECT , orally , BID 7D ) All participant receive treatment 12 month disease progress experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 422 day . Participants make multiple visit clinic , include final visit 30 day receive last dose alisertib follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>

Aged 18 year old Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 Radiographically clinically evaluable disease Part 1 study measurable disease Part 2 study Suitable venous access conduct blood sample MLN8237 pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Recovered reversible effect prior antineoplastic treatment ( exception alopecia Grade 1 neuropathy ) Pregnant lactate Treatment clinically significant enzyme inducer within 14 day prior first dose MLN8237 specify protocol Prior allogeneic bone marrow ( organ ) transplantation Newly diagnose uncontrolled cancerrelated central nervous system ( CNS ) disease Systemic antineoplastic treatment within 21 day precede first dose study treatment . Exceptions require 42day recovery period last treatment include : Nitrosoureas , mitomycin C Rituximab , alemtuzumab ( Campath® ) , unconjugated therapeutic antibody ( 21 day clear evidence progressive disease ) Treatment radioimmunoconjugates toxin immunoconjugates ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin™ ) , tositumomab ( Bexxar® ) within 56 day precede first dose study treatment Antineoplastic treatment glucocorticoid within 21 day precede first dose study treatment Radiotherapy involve &lt; 25 % hematopoietically active bone marrow within 21 day precede first dose study treatment Radiotherapy involve ≥25 % hematopoietically active bone marrow within 42 day precede first dose study treatment Inability swallow capsule know gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease GI procedure could interfere oral absorption tolerance MLN8237 . Examples include , limited , partial gastrectomy , history small intestine surgery , celiac disease .
