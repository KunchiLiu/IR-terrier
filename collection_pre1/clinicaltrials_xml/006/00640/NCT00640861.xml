	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know vaccine effective treating breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study side effect three different vaccine therapy compare vaccine see well work treat patient previously treat stage II stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Previously Treated Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine safety immunization efficacy MUC1 HER-2/neu peptide vaccine combine CpG oligodeoxynucleotide , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , , immune adjuvant suspend Freund 's incomplete adjuvant patient previously treat stage II III adenocarcinoma breast . Secondary - To describe impact immunization clinical outcome patient MUC1-positive breast cancer term disease-free survival overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord Her-2/neu status ( positive v negative ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm A : Patients receive vaccine comprise incomplete Freund 's adjuvant , MUC1 antigen vaccine , two Her-2/neu peptide-based vaccine , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . - Arm B : Patients receive vaccine comprise incomplete Freund 's adjuvant , MUC1 antigen vaccine , two Her-2/neu peptide-based vaccine ( one different arm A ) , CpG oligodeoxynucleotide SC day 1 . - Arm C : Patients receive vaccine comprise incomplete Freund 's adjuvant , MUC1 antigen vaccine , two Her-2/neu peptide-based vaccine ( one different arm A ; arm B ) , GM-CSF , CpG oligodeoxynucleotide SC day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete 6 course treatment without disease recurrence second primary intolerable toxicity go observation phase study 2 year . Patients develop recurrent disease observational phase go event monitoring phase 2 year . Blood sample collect periodically . Blood sample tissue sample patient 's recent surgery use correlative study include immune response T helper CTL epitopes Elispot tetramer analysis ; antigenic profiling expression analysis class I HLA antigen , MUC1 , HER-2 tumor tissue . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically disease recurrence 2 year .</detailed_description>
