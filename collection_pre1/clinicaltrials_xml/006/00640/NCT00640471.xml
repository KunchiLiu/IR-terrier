	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Brivanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether give brivanib together cetuximab effective cetuximab alone treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study cetuximab see well work compare cetuximab give together brivanib treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab With Without Brivanib Treating Patients With K-Ras Wild Type Tumours Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare overall survival patient previously treat K-Ras wild type metastatic colorectal carcinoma treat brivanib alaninate combination cetuximab versus placebo combination cetuximab . Secondary - To compare progression-free survival patient . - To compare objective response rate duration response patient . - To compare quality life patient . - To compare health utility patient . - To conduct comparative economic evaluation patient . - To evaluate safety profile regimen patient . - To explore association FGF-2 , BRAF mutation , amphiregulin ( AREG ) epiregulin ( EREG ) determine paraffin embed tumor specimens potential clinical benefit addition brivanib alaninate placebo cetuximab term overall survival , progression-free survival objective response rate compare cetuximab alone . - To explore association mRNA and/or protein expression and/or variation gene associate epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , angiogenesis , relate pathway potential clinical benefit addition brivanib alaninate cetuximab term overall survival , progression-free survival , objective response rate compare cetuximab alone . - To explore association change Collagen IV blood potential clinical benefit addition brivanib alaninate cetuximab term overall survival , progression-free survival objective response rate compare cetuximab alone . - To establish comprehensive tumor bank link clinical database study molecular marker colorectal cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral brivanib alaninate daily cetuximab IV 60-120 minute weekly . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily cetuximab IV 60-120 minute weekly . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue blood sample collect correlative study . Samples analyze biomarker level ( Collagen IV , FGF-2 , epiregulin , amphiregulin , BRAF mutation status ) correlation response . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 8 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
