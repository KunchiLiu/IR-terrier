	<brief_summary>In study , combination two T-cell direct antibody conjugate cell-killing toxin evaluate . Previous vitro study demonstrate so-called immunotoxin-combination ( IT-combination ) act synergistically eliminate T cell . In subsequent clinical pilot-study , IT-combination generate encouraging result apply third line therapy . Extensive biological clinical response could note absence severe acute toxicity . Building experience , current study aim evaluate characteristic IT-combination administer earlier phase disease , i.e . second line instead third line therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>`` The experimental design non-controlled multicentric fixed-dose Phase I/II study . A total 12 evaluable patient enrol 4 transplant center throughout Netherlands , 9 12 month period . The treatment consist standard dose 4 infusion IT-combination ( 4 mg/m2 ) , give 48-hours apart 4-hour period . The intended follow-up period 12 month . The patient also ask participate additional research aim determine presence evolution biomarkers suggestive extent IT-combination 'resets T-cell compartment , induce clinical tolerance , and/or enhances risk over-immunosuppression .
