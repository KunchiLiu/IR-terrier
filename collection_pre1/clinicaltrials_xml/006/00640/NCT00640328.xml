	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Dose-finding Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial consist two phase , 48 week treatment period , follow individualized treatment period two year . Patients treat cohort increase dos ( 100 mg , 300 mg 700 mg ) 12 patient dose cohort . Within cohort patient randomize asymmetrically 2:1 ratio eight patient receive ofatumumab four patient receive placebo . After 24 week patient randomize placebo treat active dose cohort . For blind purpose , patient randomize active dose treat placebo 24 week . Thus , patient receive two administration trial product 24 week follow-up result total treatment period 48 week duration . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) review evaluate safety data cohort , minimum 4 week data include week 4 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) least 10 patient , consider progression next high dose cohort acceptable . The trial product administer two infusion separate two week . Clinical assessment Gadolinium enhance ( Gd-enhanced ) MRI scan perform week -4 , 0 , 2 , 4 , every 4 week week 48 . The MRI scan week 2 carry safety assessment prior administer second infusion first treatment course . When patient dose cohort dose week 4 MRI scan perform , IDMC review available safety data . After completion week 48 patient follow monitor B-cell IgG normalization . B-cell level monitor every 12 week CD19+ cell return baseline level ( Visit 3 ) normalize level . If B-cell level normalize two year patient follow either IgG B-cell level normalize ( see Section 9.2.4 detail ) . During period Gd-enhanced MRI follow scan perform every 12 week evaluate potential rebound , safety Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) monitoring .</detailed_description>
