	<brief_title>Methionine-Restriction Diet ( MRD ) Obese Adults With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methionine deficient diet show increase metabolic rate , decrease weight extend lifespan rodent . A methionine deficient diet test 17 week human without adverse event average weight loss 8 kg . This study test ability low methionine diet cause weight loss improve metabolic syndrome . The metabolic syndrome drive insulin resistance associate abdominal fat , study hope reduce visceral fat , body weight improve insulin resistance . Twenty-four healthy male females 21 60 year age , inclusive stable weight waist circumference &gt; 40 '' men &gt; 35 '' woman participate study . Subjects need least two follow : 1 ) HDL cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dL men &lt; 50 mg/dl woman ; 2 ) triglyceride &gt; 150 mg/dL , 3 ) blood pressure &gt; 130/85 mmHg ; 4 ) fast glucose 110-125 mg/dL . Subjects diabetes , history heart attack , stroke , cancer last five year take chronic medication significant illness exclude . Subjects medical history , physical examination , chemistry panel , complete blood count ( CBC ) , electrocardiogram , DEXA , abdominal CT scan quantitate visceral fat , blood send Orentreich glucose , insulin , C-peptide , lipid profile particle size , free fatty acid , adiponectin , leptin , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , insulin-like growth factor-1 . Subjects also undergo hyperinsulinemic , euglycemic clamp quantitate insulin resistance 18 hr inpatient stay , spend 24 hour metabolic chamber measure metabolic rate . Subjects place diet Hominex-2 , drink give protein amount base body weight , see dietitian give list food eat consist mainly fruit , vegetable small amount grain . Calories restrict subject receive choline supplement 500 mg/d . Subjects randomize receive capsule contain methionine placebo base body weight . The two group 2mg/kg/d 23 mg/kg/d methionine . Participants return PBRC every 2 week throughout 16-week diet period meet dietician , weight vital sign record , fast blood drawn every 4 week send Orentreich compliance measure . The physical exam , multi-slice CT scan , DEXA , inpatient admission euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp , metabolic chamber stay , blood testing obtain screen baseline repeat completion 16 week diet period . There known risk low methionine diet , people may gastrointestinal upset change diet . The risk CT scan exposure x-radiation equivalent front side view chest x-ray . The risk DEXA exposure x-irradiation equivalent spending 12 hour sunshine . There risk stay metabolic chamber . The hyperinsulinemic , euglycemic clamp could cause low blood sugar . This avoided frequent monitoring blood sugar , low blood sugar occur , test would stop sugar give intravenous line . The test blood involves discomfort needle go arm vein , bruise rarely faint infection . These risk minimize trained technician use sterile needle .</detailed_description>
