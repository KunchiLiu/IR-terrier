	<brief_summary>We propose open , prospective , multi-center Phase III study evaluate diagnostic performance safety seven new T.R.U.E . Test allergen : Gold sodium thiosulfate , Hydrocortisone-17-butyrate , Bacitracin , Parthenolide , Methyldibromoglutaronitrile , Disperse blue 106 , Bronopol.Allergen performance safety evaluate adult patient suspect contact dermatitis , adult patient know suspected sensitization least one seven allergen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation T.R.U.E . TESTÂ® : Safety Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint : The performance ( efficacy ) allergen evaluate adult patient suspect contact dermatitis , adult patient know suspected sensitization least one seven allergen . Performance base : - Calculated concordance/discordance T.R.U.E . Test Panel 3.2 allergen correspond petrolatum aqueous-based allergen . - Calculated sensitivity specificity T.R.U.E . Test Panel 3.2 allergen . Secondary endpoint : To evaluate safety seven T.R.U.E . Test Panels 3.2 allergen ( Gold sodium thiosulfate , Hydrocortisone-17-butyrate , Methyldibromoglutaronitrile , Bacitracin , Parthenolide , Disperse blue 106 Bronopol ) adult subject suspect contact dermatitis ( `` consecutives '' ) , and/or adult subject clinical history contact dermatitis current previous positive patch test one ( ) 7 allergen ( `` sensitive '' ) . Evaluations base : - The frequency characterization late and/or persistent reaction , tape-induced irritation test site , incomplete panel adhesion , subject-reported sensation itch burn test period . - The frequency adverse event serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
