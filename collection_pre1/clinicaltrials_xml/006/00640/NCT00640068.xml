	<detailed_description>This study collaborative quality assurance initiative organize Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan Blue Cross Network ( BCBSM/BCN ) initiation insurance coverage coronary artery CT scanning ( CCTA ) , relatively new procedure provide non-invasive coronary angiogram . While procedure promise rapidly diagnose patient unknown chest pain reduce cost medical care , substantial potential abuse excess cost inappropriate care appropriately use . The Consortium 's objective educate participate site clinical us CCTA well best-practice recommendation ; create database ( Registry ) develop evidence best-practice utilization CCTA ; provide feedback mechanism sit positive negative evidence best-practice utilization CCTA ; develop strategy improve utilization CCTA ; monitor CQI process individual participating site ; reduce cost improve safety efficiency care patient acute chest pain , indeterminate stress test result , assess coronary bypass graft patency .</detailed_description>
