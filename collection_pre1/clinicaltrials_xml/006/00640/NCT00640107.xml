	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) non-invasive diagnostic imaging technology produce image body . This technology utilize radiation , Computed Tomography ( CT ) rely radio wave strong magnet produce image . The purpose study evaluate new commercially available MR image sequence and/or hardware instal exist MR unit evaluate new MR unit . The study also serve familiarize MR technical staff operate new equipment . The information obtain use optimize new MR equipment instal MR scanner</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Purpose This Study Evaluate New Commercially Available MRI Sequence and/or Hardware</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) utilize 20 year clinical research tool SUNY Upstate Medical University . Currently , five ( 5 ) MR ( 1 low-field 0.2 Tesla , 3 high-field 1.5 Tesla 1 3.0 Tesla ) unit use university campus . During time , new image sequence hardware include small powerful magnet faster computer develop assist diagnosis many disease process . MR Angiography , MR Spectroscopy , diffusion weight image dedicate combination Neurovascular head neck coil several many image sequence specialize coil develop last several year . New image sequence hardware include 4.0 7.0 Tesla magnet currently undergo development test several university United States worldwide . As consequence many new innovation MR image must periodically upgrade exist MR unit occasion replace one exist MR unit purchase new MR unit . This ensure date MR equipment provide state art diagnostic imaging capability University Hospital . The new imaging sequence and/or hardware must optimize MR unit achieve high signal noise ( SNR ) contrast noise ( CNR ) ratios reasonable scan time . This practice routinely perform every university private hospital well outpatient image center new MR unit instal exist unit upgrade</detailed_description>
