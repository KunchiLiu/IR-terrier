	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy together intermittent cetuximab effective combination chemotherapy give together continuous cetuximab treat colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give combination chemotherapy together intermittent cetuximab see well work compare combination chemotherapy give together continuous cetuximab first-line therapy treat patient advanced metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare activity , term failure-free survival , patient K-ras-normal ( wild type ) advance and/or metastatic colorectal cancer treat intermittent combination chemotherapy comprise oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil ( OxMdG ) oxaliplatin capecitabine ( XELOX ) intermittent vs continuous cetuximab first-line therapy . - To compare safety feasibility regimens patient . Secondary - To compare safety cetuximab reintroduction , term frequency grade 3-4 allergic reaction patient . - To compare improvement disease control ( i.e. , complete response plus partial response plus stable disease ) 24 week patient treat regimen . - To compare overall progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To compare response rate 12 , 24 , 36 week patient treat regimen . - To compare toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomise 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( intermittent chemotherapy intermittent cetuximab ) : Patients receive 1 follow combination chemotherapy cetuximab regimen : - OxMdG : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 2 . Patients also receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course ( 12 week ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - XELOX ( patient line-related problem ) : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-15 ( 28 dos ) . Patients also receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course ( 12 week ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 12 week study therapy , patient disease progression remove study . Patients stable respond disease stop treatment OxMdG XELOX cetuximab undergo clinical evaluation least every 6 week disease progression clinical deterioration . Upon evidence disease progression clinical deterioration , patient restart treatment OxMdG XELOX cetuximab continue alternate 12 week treatment treatment break absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression study therapy stop treatment proceed second-line therapy best supportive care . - Arm II ( intermittent chemotherapy continuous cetuximab ) : Patients receive OxMdG XELOX cetuximab 12 week arm I . Patients disease progression 12 week study therapy remove study . Patients stable respond disease* 12 week study therapy stop treatment OxMdG XELOX continue treatment cetuximab weekly monotherapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo clinical evaluation arm I . Upon progression , patient restart treatment OxMdG XELOX continue cetuximab , , alternate 12 week combine OxMdG XELOX cetuximab therapy cetuximab monotherapy . Patients disease progression study therapy stop treatment proceed second-line therapy arm I . Previously collect tumor tissue sample obtain baseline analyze IHC EGFR status tumor . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
