	<brief_title>Effectiveness Deep Brain Stimulation Treating People With Treatment Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) chronic debilitate illness affect 2 % 3 % adult United States . People OCD often experience persistent unwanted thought carry ritual-like behavior rid obsessive thought . Additionally , OCD symptoms usually tie feeling intense anxiety functional impairment , make important people OCD seek effective treatment . Although currently many treatment option OCD , include psychotherapy medication serotonin reuptake inhibitor , 40 % 60 % people OCD partially respond respond treatment method . Given large percentage people respond aggressive conventional treatment , alternative option necessary people treatment-resistant OCD . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) procedure involve use thin wire carry electric current part brain associate produce OCD symptom . DBS effectively safely used treat movement disorder , Parkinson 's disease , may beneficial reduce OCD symptom severity . This study evaluate safety effectiveness DBS treat people severe otherwise treatment-resistant OCD . Study participation follow-up last 4 year . Participants allow remain pre-surgical medication behavioral therapy program throughout study . Before surgery , participant undergo 3- 4-day series initial test examination include physical neurological examination ; blood urine screening test ; electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ; electroencephalography ( EEG ) ; detail psychological testing , include test perception , learning , memory . The EEGs may perform surgery measure potential change brain electrical activity due DBS . On day surgery , participant take low dose anxiety medication , metal frame fix head support surgery , undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan determine place stimulate wire . After injected local anesthetic , participant undergo first part operation , involve implantation neurostimulators ventral caudate/ventral striatum brain region . For second part operation , participant administer general anesthesia , implantable neurostimulators ( INSs ) place chest connect wire brain place skin . The entire surgical procedure take 3 4 hour , 1- 2-day post-operative hospital stay recovery . During post-operative stay , participant undergo x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan head . Two 3 week surgery , participant divide randomly either group receive DBS immediately group first receive sham DBS active DBS 3 month . The level stimulation adjust individually basis participant 's response stimulation . Participants complete rating form , clinical evaluation , check stimulators every month first 3 month , least every 3 month rest year , every 6 month remain year study . On Year 1 visit , participant repeat baseline detailed psychological testing . Periodically throughout 4-year study , staff contact participant phone ask OCD symptom , mood , anxiety , possible side effect . Also throughout study , participant need INSs replace every 5 16 month average . Participants also invite participate relate study involve positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan determine stimulation change activity brain . Participation separate PET study optional affect current study participation .</detailed_description>
