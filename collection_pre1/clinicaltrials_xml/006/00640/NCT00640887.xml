	<brief_summary>The overall aim project evaluate rifabutin ( RBT ) replacement rifampicin ( RMP ) , combine treatment tuberculosis HIV infection . RBT represent alternative RMP HIV infect patient half-life longer enzymatic induction effect appear less important associate antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) drug . This phase II trial determine precisely pharmacokinetics parameter RBT combination different ART regimens Vietnamese HIV infect patient pulmonary tuberculosis , order define optimal dos test large phase III trial compare safety , tolerability efficacy RBT RMP regimens .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients offer participated study first 6 week nationally recommend TB treatment . All enrol patient switch rifabutin randomize , two week later , one three study ARV regimens . The RBT dos adapt allocated ARV regimen accord cross scheme . Three full pharmacokinetics profile perform different time point : initiation ARV , one month first RFB dosage one month second RFB dosage .</detailed_description>
