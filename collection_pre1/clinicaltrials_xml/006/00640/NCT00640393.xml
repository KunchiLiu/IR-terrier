	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Combining nbUVB Etanercept Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participant receive etanercept 50 mg twice week 12 week . Participants reach PASI-90 Day 84 discontinue study ( continue receive commercial etanercept outside study ) . Participants remain study Day 84 decrease etanercept 50 mg weekly another 12 week . Participants attain 90 percent reduction PASI baseline ( PASI-90 ) 12 week randomize ( 1:1 ) receive either etanercept alone etanercept short course narrow band ultra violet B ( nbUVB ) phototherapy . Participants randomize nbUVB group receive nbUVB treatment three time week least four week . At every plan study visit Day 84 , nbUVB treatment discontinue participant reach PASI-90 . nbUVB phototherapy re-initiated another four week subsequent plan study visit lose PASI-90 response . Efficacy evaluate PASI , BSA PGA blind evaluator Days 0 , 28 , 84 , 112 , 140 168 . The effect treatment quality life evaluate use DLQI questionnaire Days 112 , 140 168 . Safety evaluate physical examination adverse event evaluation .</detailed_description>
