	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination RAD001 erlotinib hydrochloride slow growth advance pancreatic cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Primary Objectives : -Determine overall survival ( OS ) 6 month combination erlotinib RAD001 patient receive previous treatment advance pancreatic cancer . Secondary Objectives : - Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) . - Determine response rate ( RR ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib RAD001 ( Everolimus ) Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : RAD001 design stop cancer cell multiply . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , may cause tumor cell die . Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take erlotinib hydrochloride mouth every day 28-day study `` cycle '' . You take erlotinib hydrochloride day morning 1 cup ( 8 oz . ) water . Erlotinib hydrochloride take least 1 hour 2 hour food , vitamin , iron supplement , non-prescription drug . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle , take RAD001 mouth morning . You either take study drug empty stomach 2 cup ( 16 oz . ) water low-fat meal . You take study drug large fatty meal fatty meal low amount study drug body . Some example low-fat meal include cereal fat-free milk , low-fat muffin , toast , bagel fat-free spread , fruit salad . On day take RAD001 erlotinib hydrochloride , RAD001 take right erlotinib hydrochloride . If experience intolerable side effect , must call doctor right away . The doctor may tell stop take study drug take few pill . The study drug may also stop completely , doctor think necessary . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You fasting time blood draw . You eat drink anything except water midnight night . - You ask drug may take take since last visit . On Day 8 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You fasting time blood draw . You eat drink anything except water midnight night . - You ask drug may take take since last visit . At end every even cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , CT MRI scan check status disease . The scan type screen . Length Study : You may remain study long benefitting . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect , doctor decides best interest stop treatment . End-of-Study Visit : About 14 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You fasting time blood draw . You eat drink anything except water midnight night . - If within last 4 week , CT MRI scan check status disease . The scan type screen . Long-Term Follow-Up : After go study , ask month first 6 month begin study treatment . Then ask every 3 month . This may do either phone contact clinic visit take 15-30 minute . This investigational study . Erlotinib hydrochloride combination gemcitabine commercially available FDA approve treatment pancreatic cancer . RAD001 FDA approve commercially available . At time , combination drug use research . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
