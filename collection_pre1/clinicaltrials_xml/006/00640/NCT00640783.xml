	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome identify target dietary therapy reduce risk cardiovascular disease ; however , role diet etiology metabolic syndrome poorly understood . To assess effect Mediterranean-style diet endothelial function vascular inflammatory marker patient metabolic syndrome Randomized , single-blind trial conduct June 2001 January 2004 university hospital Italy among 180 patient ( 99 men 81 woman ) metabolic syndrome , define Adult Treatment Panel III . Patients intervention group ( n = 90 ) instruct follow Mediterranean-style diet receive detailed advice increase daily consumption whole grain , fruit , vegetable , nut , olive oil ; patient control group ( n = 90 ) follow prudent diet ( carbohydrate , 50 % -60 % ; protein , 15 % -20 % ; total fat , &lt; 30 % ) . After 2 year , patient follow Mediterranean-style diet consume food rich monounsaturated fat , polyunsaturated fat , fiber low ratio omega-6 omega-3 fatty acid . Total fruit , vegetable , nut intake ( 274 g/d ) , whole grain intake ( 103 g/d ) , olive oil consumption ( 8 g/d ) also significantly high intervention group ( P &lt; .001 ) . The level physical activity increase group approximately 60 % , without difference group . Mean body weight decreased patient intervention group ( -4.0 kg ) control group ( -1.2 kg ) ( P &lt; .001 ) . Compared patient consume control diet , patient consume intervention diet significantly reduce serum concentration hs-CRP ( P = .01 ) , IL-6 ( P = .04 ) , IL-7 ( P = 0.4 ) , IL-18 ( P = 0.3 ) , well decreased insulin resistance ( P &lt; .001 ) . Endothelial function score improved intervention group remain stable control group . At 2 year follow-up , 40 patient intervention group still feature metabolic syndrome , compare 78 patient control group ( P &lt; .001 ) . A Mediterranean-style diet might effective reduce prevalence metabolic syndrome associate cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>
