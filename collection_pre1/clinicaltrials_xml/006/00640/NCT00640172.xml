	<brief_summary>Eligible elderly men woman anemia undergo full hematologic evaluation plus additional laboratory test determine etiology anemia . In subset subject , bone marrow aspirate biopsy obtain plan analysis erythroid progenitor stem cell . Plasma ; serum ; bone marrow sample compare elderly non-anemic control .

	<detailed_description>Eligible elderly men woman anemia undergo full hematologic evaluation ( blood sample complete blood count , CBC ) determine etiology anemia ( eg , myelodysplastic syndrome ) . Peripheral smear ; iron study ; serum creatinine ; serum erythropoietin ; reticulocyte count ; vitamin B12 ; folate level may obtained/conducted . When etiology identify ( ie , `` unexplained anemia '' ) , additional laboratory test perform include urinary hepcidin level ; plasma cytokine level ; serum soluble transferrin receptor ; C-reactive protein ; erythrocyte sedimentation rate ; D-Dimer ; neopterin level ; tryptophan level ; blood cytokine profile may include IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , VEGF level . Serum ; plasma ; nucleate peripheral blood cell may bank future DNA analysis . In subset find either unexplained anemia ( approximately 6 30 subject ) anemia chronic inflammation ( approximately 6 30 subject ) , bone marrow aspirate biopsy may perform planned analysis erythroid progenitor stem cell population . In addition , plasma serum bone marrow sample obtain elderly non-anemic control ( approximately 6 30 subject ) , bone marrow sample purchase non-anemic young control ( approximately 6 30 subject ) .</detailed_description>
