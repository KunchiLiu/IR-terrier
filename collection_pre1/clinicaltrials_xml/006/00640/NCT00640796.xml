	<brief_summary>Modern frontline therapy patient hematologic malignancy base intensive administration multiple drug . In patient relapsed disease , response drug generally poor , dosage increase without unacceptable toxicity . For patient , particularly relapse still receive frontline therapy , therapeutic option hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . For relapse transplant , eligible transplant persistent disease , proven curative therapy . There mount evidence NK cell powerful anti-leukemia activity . In patient undergo allogeneic SCT , several study demonstrate NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity . NK cell infusion patient primary refractory multiple-relapsed leukemia show well tolerate void graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) effect . Myeloid leukemias particularly sensitive NK cell cytotoxicity , B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cell often NK-resistant . We develop novel method expand NK cell enhance cytotoxicity . Expanded activated donor NK cell show powerful anti-leukemic activity acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell T-lineage ALL cell vitro animal model leukemia . The present study represent translation laboratory finding clinical application.We propose determine safety infuse expand NK cell pediatric patient chemotherapy refractory relapse hematologic malignancy include AML , T-lineage ALL , T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma ( T-LL ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , Ewing sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) . The NK cell use study obtain patient 's family member partial match patient 's immune type ( HLA type ) .</brief_summary>
