	<brief_title>Wheeze Detection Children During Dynamic Bronchial Situations Measured WIM-PC™ Recording</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma common cause hospitalization respiratory infection infant one year age . About 1-2 % infant bronchiolitis need hospitalize approximately 8 % child require intensive care . Pulmonary function test infant objective , require sedation , problematic acutely ill infant . Wheeze quantification lung sound analysis method objective , non invasive show correlate clinical status asthma bronchiolitis . The recording procedure simple , require attachment 4 ECG-size sensor chest wall . A 30-second recording often adequate , record time extend necessary , obtain good quality data , wheeze detect counted high degree accuracy . Karmel Sonix Ltd develop WIM-PC™ device , indicate acoustic pulmonary function measurement quantifies presence wheezing . This study design order evaluate efficacy safety use WIM-PC™ device wheeze detection dynamic bronchial situation infant hospitalize result asthmatic attack .</detailed_description>
