	<brief_summary>This study measure function protein call P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) , find blood-brain barrier , membrane normally prevent toxic material enter brain . Impaired P-gp function may allow toxin enter brain cause people develop certain brain disease . Healthy subject people Alzheimer disease , Parkinson disease frontotemporal dementia 35 year age old overall good health may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure three outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center : - Medical history , psychological evaluation , physical examination blood urine test , include test illegal addictive drug . - PET scan : This test use small amount radioactive chemical call tracer label active area brain activity see special camera . Before start scan , catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein arm inject tracer . The subject lie scanner bed , special mask fit head attach bed help keep head still scan image obtain clear . A brief initial scan do calibrate scanner . Then , radioactive tracer call [ ( 15 ) O ] H ( 2 ) O inject catheter PET camera take picture blood flow brain 60 second . Next , another tracer , [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop , inject catheter picture take 2 hour determine much tracer allow enter brain . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : This procedure do within 1 year ( ) PET scan . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . For procedure , patient lie table slide scanner ( tube-like device ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Alzheimer disease ( AD ) , Parkinson disease ( PD ) , frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) associate accumulation neurotoxic material brain . Potentially toxic material normally restrict brain P-glycoprotein , transporter protein express endothelial cell blood-brain barrier . Disruption blood-brain barrier report animal model AD , PD , FTD , specific dysfunction P-gp link AD PD pathology . Therefore , P-gp may protective certain neurodegenerative disease , P-gp dysfunction may risk factor develop AD , PD , FTD . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image measure P-gp function . If P-gp function abnormal , radiolabeled P-gp substrate cross blood-brain barrier enter brain . Intact P-gp function , hand , prevent substrate enter brain . If P-gp dysfunction risk factor develop AD , PD , FTD , patient disease radiolabeled substrate brain healthy control . We develop novel radioligand , [ ( 11 ) C ] N-desmethyl-loperamide [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop ) , P-gp substrate . Our goal use PET image [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop see P-gp function reduce AD , PD , FTD . Study population In protocol , wish evaluate 15 patient AD , 15 patient PD , 15 patient FTD , 15 healthy volunteer . Design Subjects undergo screen history , physical exam , ECG , blood urine laboratory test . Subjects receive dedicate brain PET [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop brain MRI . Since [ 11C ] dLop uptake influenced blood flow , [ ( 15 ) O ] H2O PET scan perform determine flow brain . Outcome measure Our outcome measure amount [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop uptake brain AD , PD , FTD patient healthy control . Brain uptake measure percent standardize uptake value ( % SUV ) . Percent SUV reflect measure brain radioactivity [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop injection , correct patient weight inject dose [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop . As exploratory outcome measure , also correct brain uptake cerebral blood flow . Blood flow determine use [ ( 15 ) O ] H2O PET .</detailed_description>
