	<detailed_description>The chronic administration acarbose show improve insulin resistance reverse impair glucose tolerance . Both condition , especially insulin resistance , physiologically associate development progression NAFLD . Therefore , hypothesize chronic administration acarbose attenuate NAFLD improve glucose handling . This would reflect reduction intrahepatic fat accumulation . Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy sensitive non-invasive method measure change intrahepatic fat content . The primary endpoint study would demonstrate reduction intrahepatic fat measure Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 12 week administration oral acarbose . Other relevant secondary outcome previously demonstrate associated improvement NAFLD include improvement insulin resistance , normalize serum adiponectin , lower serum Leptin . A second intent study test hypothesis whether chronic administration acarbose patient NAFLD influence postprandial substrate metabolism reflect RQ measure indirect calorimetry . The consequence insulin resistance relative inhibition fatty oxidation . However , chronic administration acarbose improves insulin resistance dampens post-prandial surge serum glucose insulin . These change glucose handle could possibly result shift towards pattern preferential lipid oxidation . We anticipate either lower blunt postprandial RQ chronic administration acarbose 3 month .</detailed_description>
