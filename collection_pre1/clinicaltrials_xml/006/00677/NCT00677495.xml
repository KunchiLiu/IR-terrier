	<detailed_description>Celiac disease ( CD ) autoimmune enteropathy trigger ingestion gluten genetically susceptible subject one frequently occur , treatable , lifelong disorder . In disease recognize trigger ( gluten ) , genetic factor ( HLA DQ2/8 ) , auto-antigen ( tissue-transglutaminase enzyme ) auto-antibodies ( IgA-IgG anti-transglutaminase ) produce intestinal mucosa B lymphocytes ( Gastroenterology 2000 ; 119:234 , J Immunol 2001 ; 166:4170 ) . Undetected untreated , CD may cause severe complication later life , autoimmune disorder . Clear evidence exist gluten-related autoimmunity genetically predispose patient ( presence HLA DQ2/8 ) . It show autoimmune disorder involve organ intestine ( pancreas , cerebellum , liver , skin ) could develop unrecognized and/or untreated celiac subject persistent exposure gluten . Presently , additional risk autoimmune disease estimate 1.1 % year without diagnosis ( Gastroenterology 1999 ; 117:297 ) . Furthermore , diet contain gluten , CD patient produce organ-specific auto-antibodies ( GAD , ICA , TPO , anti-Purkinje cell , cardiac auto-antibodies ) CD relate disappear 6 12 month gluten-free diet ( J Pediatr 2000 ; 137:263 ; Lancet 1996 ; 347:369 ; Circulation 2002 ; 105:2611 ) . Bearing data mind , early diagnosis CD might prevent CD patient develop autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes thyroiditis . In view observation , recommend subject autoimmune disease risk CD screen CD repeat serological screening every three year detect case clinically silent , late-onset CD . In word , gluten-genetically predisposed subject ( test positive HLA DQ2/8 ) - test negative serum anti-tTG - become antibody-positive late life . The tTG-targeted antibody bound locally tissue transglutaminase may present diseased organ become detectable circulation , thus accessible serological testing . The intestinal mucosa early phase characterize normal villi include normal number intraepithelial lymphocyte . The process mucosal deterioration may take year even decade ( Am J Gastroenterol 2000 ; 95:463 ) long follow-up without treatment may sometimes harmful . Symptoms relate solely villous atrophy , many proven early celiac disease case suffer gluten-dependent gastrointestinal symptom even villous atrophy develop ( Gut 2006 ; 55:133 , Scand J Gastroenterol 2005 ; 40:564 , Gut 2004 ; 53:641 , Scand J Gastroenterol 1998 ; 33:944 , Acta Paediatr 1995 ; 84:1252 , Gastroenterology 1993 ; 104:1263 ) . By use phage display libraries technique possible investigate vivo ( intestinal biopsy ) early antibody responses autoimmune disease . In particularly , technique demonstrate humoral response tissue transglutaminase occur intestinal mucosal level , human VH5 gene commonly use variable region immune system CD-patients build anti-tTG . This mean phage display libraries technique able measure specificity autoimmune response tissue transglutaminase enzyme perhaps others auto-antigens ( GAD , ICA , TPO , cardiac-antigens ) CD patient . Phage display library allow u measure specific auto-antibodies production site , also patient test negative anti-tTG serum allow u identify early CD patient seroconversion deterioration jejunal mucosa . Therefore , intestinal mucosa production IgA anti-tTG could important diagnostic work-up early-stage CD , mucosal histology yet diagnostic . The investigator propose first degree relative CD patient without symptom subject autoimmune disease test negative serum anti-tTG positive CD relate HLA DQ2 DQ8 prospective study uncover early-stage gluten intolerance measure mucosal VH5 restrict gene family anti-tTG clone two biopsy : one year gluten free-diet ( GFD ) . Symptomatic subject genetically predispose gluten intolerance , test negative CD related autoantibody apparently normal intestinal mucosa , also enrol detect deposit IgA transglutaminase intestinal level , one year gluten free diet , evaluate clinical modification . Aims clinical trial : 1. measure mean phage display library gluten dependent humoral immune response ( anti-tTG ) intestinal mucosa subject high risk untreated CD , without CD-related intestinal lesion . 2. demonstrate mucosal gluten-dependent immune response 12 month gluten-free diet . 3. demonstrate dietary intervention might modify clinical condition ( e.g improvement gastrointestinal complaint extra-gastrointestinal symptom ) enrol patient improvement intestinal inflammation disappearance mucosal anti-tTG . 4. evaluate specificity double staining technique detect IgA antitransglutaminase mucosal deposit phage display antibody assay</detailed_description>
