	<brief_title>Study S-1 Oxaliplatin ( SOX ) Versus Capecitabine Oxaliplatin ( COX ) Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The urgent need new effective therapy well safety profile metastatic colorectal cancer patient promise result observe far trials S-1 combine oxaliplatin gastrointestinal cancer include colorectal cancer strongly warrant comparison S-1 combine oxaliplatin capecitabine combination oxaliplatin acknowledge standard regimen first-line treatment advance colorectal cancer patient . - Recently , Phase I study complete , indicate recommend dose S-1 100 mg/m2/day1-14 oxaliplatin ( 130 mg/m2/day1 ) , repeat every 3 week . However , phase II study use recommend dose , delayed toxicity thrombocytopenia anemia observe . These delayed toxicity also report phase II study use S-1 90 mg/m2/day plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2/day1 advance gastric cancer . At 2007 GI ASCO , interim data S-1 ( 80 mg/m2/day1-14 ) plus oxaliplatin ( 130 mg/m2/day1 ) combination , repeat every 3 week , present , show promising antitumor activity favourable safety profile . Among 18 patient , two patient Grade 3 thrombocytopenia one Grade 3 neutropenia . Response rate 57.1 % disease control rate 92.9 % . Considering result Japanese data show enhanced efficacy observe S-1 90 mg/m2/day oxaliplatin combination , S-1 80 mg/m2/day 1-14 oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2/D1 , repeat every 3 week , test study .</detailed_description>
