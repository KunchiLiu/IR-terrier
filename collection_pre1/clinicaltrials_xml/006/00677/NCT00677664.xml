	<brief_title>Effects Copaxone Retinal Function Diabetic Patients After Panphotocoagulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : evaluate neuroprotective effect Copaxone ( Glatiramer acetate ) injection nerve fiber layer thickness retinal function diabetic patient underwent panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) . Study Design : Double- Masked Randomized Clinical Trial . The follow period estimate 12 month last PRP section . Patients enrollment : Thirty patient severe nonproliferative early proliferative diabetic retinopathy previous laser treatment enrol . They divide two group : `` A '' receive Copaxone `` B '' receive mannitol ( placebo ) use block randomization . Both drug offer subcutaneous administration one week prior three section PRP , one per week . All patient receive signed write inform consent approve research ethic committee UNIFESP . Chronogram : All patient receive full ophthalmic examination ( best-corrected Log-Mar visual acuity , slit lamp examination , applanation tonometry , fundus biomicroscopy indirect fundus examination ) ; functional examination ( Humphrey 24-2 SITA STANDARD visual field , Electroretingrams FDT C-20 strategy visual field ) anatomic examination ( Color digital photography fluorescein angiography ( FAG ) , GDX- VCC , Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) Heidelberg Retinal Tomography ( HRT ) PRP 1st,3rd,6th month 1 year laser , whenever need clinical reason .</detailed_description>
