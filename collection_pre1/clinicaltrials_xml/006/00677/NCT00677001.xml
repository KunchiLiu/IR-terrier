	<detailed_description>R306465 , histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor , new drug development cancer . In study , safety ( effect body ) R306465 patient advance cancer study maximum dose tolerate patient determine . The absorption , break , elimination drug study . Antitumor activity R306465 evaluate . R306465 administer continuous regimen 21 day follow 1-week rest period , constitute 28-day treatment cycle . The dose R306465 start low increase study group 3 6 patient . If group patient severe side effect , next group patient get high dose . The dose increase patient severe side effect . The dose decrease dose level severe side effect observe less 1/3 patient . The amount R306465 blood measure effect disease evaluate patient . Patients screen eligibility within 4 week study treatment give . The duration treatment depend adverse effect whether benefit treatment . The design cycle may adjust course study guide clinical observation . The dose regimen may adjust guided information rapidly body break eliminate study drug . Patients informed change design cycle dose regimen . During first treatment cycle , patient require stay hospital least 3 night . In addition 6 daytime visit Cycles 1 2 ( combine ) may take 4 hour morning dose . From Cycle 3 onwards , 2 daytime visit per treatment cycle , visit usually take less time . Throughout study , especially Cycles 1 2 , patient undergo frequent blood urine test , procedure assess safety include heart function , test assess course patient 's illness . Two week last dose study drug , patient require return study site follow-up assessment . R306465 administer orally daily 21 consecutive day follow 1-week rest period . These 4 week constitute 1 treatment cycle . The start dose level 100mg . The dose patient assign enrollment . On basis assessment investigator , patient may continue receive study drug long clinical benefit absence intolerable side effect .</detailed_description>
