	<brief_title>Pilot Study Imatinib Mesylate Treat Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) recently describe , extremely debilitate painful condition affect individual renal failure . Recent report suggest association gadolinium exposure magnetic resonance ( MR ) study subsequent development NSF patient chronic renal failure . NSF characterize rapidly progressive skin hardening , tether hyperpigmentation , predominantly extremities . Visceral involvement rare . Skin biopsies early NSF lesion demonstrate thicken collagen bundle , mucin deposition , angiogenesis numerous dermal spindle cell stain antibody CD34 procollagen . Cutaneous change NSF present 13 % individual receive hemodialysis . Among patient clinical evidence NSF , principle investigator protocol recently report NSF associate increase early mortality 24-months . There proven therapy devastate disorder . Anecdotal report show modest improvement joint mobility decrease skin thicken extracorporeal photopheresis pentoxyphylline . Increased TGF-beta1 mRNA immunostaining observed skin , fascia striated muscle . Imatinib mesylate , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , prevent TGF-beta-induced stimulation collagen extracellular matrix protein synthesis well mRNA expression normal fibroblast . This observation lead principal investigator evaluate imatinib mesylate 400 mg p.o . daily 1 year two patient NSF . The result significant softening previously harden skin increase mobility skin previously tether underlying fascia . After one month imatinib mesylate , one two patient 20 degree reduction knee flexion contracture .</detailed_description>
