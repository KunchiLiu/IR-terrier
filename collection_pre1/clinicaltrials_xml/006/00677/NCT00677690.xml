	<brief_summary>The purpose study elucidate whether combination usual pulmonary rehabilitation neuromuscular electrical stimulation quadriceps may improve exercise capacity patient affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) extensively use technique improve muscle function different area rehabilitation , however seem appropriate critical care situation , use able patient uncertain benefit . In word , NMES seem particularly effective severely deconditioned bed ridden patient . We therefore carry randomised trial compare efficacy combination NMES PR ( NM+PR ) combination sham stimulation PR ( SS+PR ) large population moderately impaired COPD patient . Primary outcome evaluation effect NMES quadriceps strength exercise capacity . Secondary outcome evaluation effect NMES symptom ( dyspnoea ) quality life .</detailed_description>
