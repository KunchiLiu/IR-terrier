	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy TAK-442 Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute coronary syndrome , include myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation stable unstable angina , acknowledge represent collectively major global healthcare problem . Despite exist treatment , rate patient mortality , myocardial infarction hospital readmission follow-up remain high . Due critical role propagate blood coagulation cascade , activate factor X consider major therapeutic target development novel antithrombotic therapy block thrombin generation attenuate formation fibrin . Therefore , activate factor X inhibitor , exhibit either indirect direct mode action , among novel agent investigation treatment acute coronary syndrome . This study evaluate safety tolerability TAK-442 compare placebo post-acute coronary syndrome subject also receive standard antiplatelet cardiovascular therapy . Individuals want participate study require provide write informed consent . Study participation anticipate approximately 3.5 month . Multiple procedures occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , physical examination , electrocardiograms bilateral venogram .</detailed_description>
