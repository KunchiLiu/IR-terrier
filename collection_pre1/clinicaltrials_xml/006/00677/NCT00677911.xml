	<brief_summary>Principal Investigator/Program Director ( Last , First , Middle ) : Darnall , Beth APS Future Leaders Pain Small Research Grants Application Page 5 Continuation Format Page Summary : Chronic pain stressful , physically psychologically . Stressful experience induce autonomic nervous system arousal , reliably lead inflammation immune suppression . Inflammation exacerbate exist pain may key factor genesis maintenance pain . Stress-induced immune effect detect two hour ( 2 hr ) post-stressor , suggest stressful experience per day may sufficient sustain elevated pain levels1 . Cognition emerge potential mediating factor relationship pain stress . Mentally recreate emotionally stressful event induces de novo physiological stress1 . In word , think emotionally charge event down-regulates autonomic stress response subsequent immune effect . Therefore , explore cognition mediate factor stress , pain , inflammation inform understand pain pathway , well improve treatment pain . Study Rationale : The acute stress response induce immunosuppression ; however , relationship study arbitrary model ( shock avoidance , job interview ) . This study employ novel approach examine stress immune response personally relevant stressor ( pain ) ; prior study use arbitrary model ( shock avoidance , job interview ) . Pain offer highly salient personal context well-suited investigation negative cognitive perseveration . Pain acutely sensitive exacerbation via inflammation , thus relevance examine immune effect rumination future negative expectation ( `` expect bad '' ) underscore . Goal : To test biological consequence negative expectation , achieve via active 10-minute negative cognitive perseveration personally relevant stressor : future worsen one 's chronic pain condition . Biological stress response measure via heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) serum cortisol . Impact negative cognition inflammation measure use interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-Î± ) biomarkers immune function , control depression pain catastrophizing . This study aim inform understand pain mechanism . Aim 1 : Determine magnitude autonomic stress response induction negative cognition . Aim 2 : Determine immune effect experiment-induced stress response . Aim 3 : Establish whether pre-existing tendency catastrophize mediates relationship experiment-induced negative perseveration immune effect . Aim 4 : Establish whether stress-related increase IL-6 remain elevated post 2 hr .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : This prospective study examines magnitude biological stress subsequent immunologic change response negative cognitive perseveration . Five physiological measurement time point occur course 3 hour experiment . Demographics health characteristic interest : gender , marital status , smoke status , education level , race , height , weight , body mass index , medical comorbidity , psychological comorbidity , medication ( inflammation , pain , psychiatric condition ) . Inclusionary Criteria - &gt; 18 year age ; &lt; 65 year age - Non-inflammatory musculoskeletal patient present evaluation Oregon Health &amp; Science University ( OHSU ) Comprehensive Pain Center ( CPC ) Exclusionary Criteria - Active recent virus/infection - Thought disorder , Suicidality , - Substance Abuse - Active corticosteroid regimen - Pregnancy - Limited venous access - Former intravenous drug user Enrollment : All person present evaluation CPC meet study criterion offer option participate study . Approximately 60 new pain patient evaluate psychology monthly expect obtain goal 40 participant within 6 month . Informed consent obtain compliance OHSU Institutional Review Board protocol . Subjects receive $ 100 gift certificate compensation , even fail complete study . We anticipate low completion failure rate study complete one 3-hour time block . Study time standardized account circadian effect . Participants tell arrive eaten light breakfast minimal caffeine consumption ( e.g. , less 2 cup coffee ) . They give subject number psychiatric diagnosis blind prevent bias . The study involve gather 5 serum sample thus participant catheterize nursing staff minimize physiological stress . Principal Investigator/Program Director ( Last , First , Middle ) : Darnall , Beth APS Future Leaders Pain Small Research Grants Application Page 7 Continuation Format Page Study site : The study conduct NIH-funded General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . The GCRC provide state art resource include research space , specialize research nurse perform blood draw gather biodata , biostatisticians , sophisticated laboratory perform serum biomarker analysis . OHSU 's GCRC Oregon 's premier multidisciplinary patient-oriented research facility house building CPC , thus minimize travel burden participant . Active Stress Induction : Negative Cognitive Perseveration On experiment day , participant interface licensed clinical psychologist perform clinical interview blind diagnosis . The psychologist instruct participant talk 10 minute bad aspect pain , discuss loss control situation , negative impact pain life others . They guide imagine situation progressively worsen , focus badly feel result . Two measure induction efficacy give : subjective verbal rating ( 0-10 ) objective rating attend psychologist ( 0-10 ) . The intervention end 10 minute remainder study involve biodata measurement . Study end 2.5 hr post induction follow final blood draw . The psychologist debrief subject assess affective state . Their subjective unit distress check . Persons continue negative cognitive state receive 30 minute Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) on-site psychologist . Care take allow participant leave study site distress . Participants receive follow psychology care CPC indicate treatment plan .</detailed_description>
