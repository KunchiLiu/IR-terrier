	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) disease important cause morbidity solid organ transplantation recipient . Viral reactivation , either donor origin endogenous latent virus involve complex series step . A number factor contribute CMV reactivation latency include exogenous immunosuppression , pre-existing host immunity , cytokine dysregulation [ 1,2 ] . Symptomatic patient classify CMV disease , present viral syndrome ( fever , malaise ) tissue invasive disease , hepatitis pneumonitis . CMV also indirect manifestation due immunomodulatory effect viral replication , result opportunistic infection acute chronic allograft injury [ 2-4 ] . CMV disease organ transplant recipient generally treat finite course intravenous oral antiviral therapy . However , risk recurrent CMV disease estimate 25-30 % [ 5-7 ] . The pathogenesis CMV reactivation , viral replication , disease progression , viral persistence likely related number host factor transplant patient , include degree type immunosuppressive therapy , pre-existing immunity [ 8,9 ] . However , CMV remarkably complex virus large genome encode approximately 200 open read frame . A number viral factor likely also play role determine risk CMV disease , risk tissue invasion , response therapy , risk recurrence therapy initiate . The virus commit large percentage total genome cod capacity task modulate host cell behaviour host response infection [ 8,9 ] . These include CMV gene product aim escape host defence mechanism commonly refer CMV immune evasion gene [ 9-11 ] . Some immune evasion gene encode protein actively interfere distinct step antigen expression pathway thus contribute viral persistence despite active host immune response . For example US2 , US3 , US6 , US11 encode protein whose ultimate effect reduce level MHC class I proteins surface infected cell . The CMV UL141 gene product provide protection kill wide array NK cell population , via block surface expression NK cell-activating ligand CD155 [ 26 ] . Also , human CMV express several homologues host G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCRs ) , chemokine receptor homologue US28 best characterize [ 27 ] . Although exact significance US28 determine , protein product may play role cell entry , leukocyte chemotaxis , viral dissemination immune evasion [ 27 ] . MicroRNAs MicroRNAs recently discover small endogenous non-coding RNAs . These small RNAs ~22 nucleotide length crucial post-transcriptional regulator gene expression wide spectrum normal abnormal biological process include antiviral defence , oncogenesis development high eukaryote . Recently several virus genome also find encode microRNAs . The present understanding biological function virus-encoded microRNAs remain sketchy , evidence mainly derive study individual small set microRNAs encode virus cognate host . Survival strategy virus counter strategy host cell miRNAs host viral origin respective target form crux host virus interaction mediate microRNAs . Thus microRNAs form complex link regulatory network host pathogen . A thorough understanding microRNA-mediated host-pathogen interaction essential understanding basic pathophysiological change associate viral infection MicroRNAs CMV A number viral microRNAs find CMV . The function majority largely unknown . Recently , function specific microRNA ( miR-UL-112-1 ) encode CMV partially elucidate . Stern-Ginossar et al . use new bioinformatics tool identify major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I-related chain B ( MICB ) mRNA target miRNA encode CMV . MICB cellular ligand activate receptor NKG2D , express natural killer cell , γ/δ T cell , CD8+ T cell . During cellular stress , cause viral infection , MICB induce , thus activate natural killer T cell lead kill infected cell . Therefore block process would probably benefit virus . Stern-Ginossar et al . show cell infect CMV engineer lack miR-UL112-1 susceptible kill NKG2D-dependent manner natural killer cell . The CMV-encoded protein UL16 , also provide protection detection infect cell natural killer cell , sequester MICB intracellular milieu prevent reach cell surface . Why virus two different mechanism achieve goal clear , particularly since closely relate NKG2D-ligand MICA induce viral infection . Members laboratory I recently described2 another function miRNA . Successful , persistent infection depend maintenance cell viability despite production toxic viral protein . One way CMV restrict production viral protein restrict viral replication . We observe miR-UL112-1 down-regulates expression CMV gene involve replication process , part target viral mRNA ( encode protein call immediate early 72 ) regulate transcription viral gene require acute replication .</detailed_description>
