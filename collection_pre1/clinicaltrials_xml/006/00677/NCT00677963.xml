	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis systemic disease large artery lead cause death Western society . The development atherosclerosis involve accumulation lipid , cell extracellular matrix blood vessel wall . It progressive disease characterize formation fibrous cap smooth muscle cell proliferation migration , development necrotic/lipid core . This core develop due accumulation lipid apoptosis lipid-loaded macrophage . In process intima , innermost layer blood vessel , thicken . This lead narrow lumen obstruction blood flow . The developed lesion vessel wall may become vulnerable rupture fibrous cap . Cap rupture expose necrotic core blood lead formation thrombus . The thrombus may fully partially obstruct lumen cause cardiovascular complication , myocardial infarction stroke . Although atherosclerosis form origin cardiovascular disease , present much remain unknown atherogenic process . Therefore , essential research do discover novel mechanism atherosclerotic development . Intimal neovascularisation recently draw much attention novel factor , likely contribute atherosclerotic plaque growth rupture . Neovascularisation occur intima thickens associate stenosis , plaque inflammation hemorrhage . Because increased amount neovascularisation may associate increase risk stroke , would highly desirable identify plaque neovascularisation noninvasive imaging . At present , image neovascular development atherosclerotic lesion conventional ultrasound feasible , since vessel diameter well resolution capacity currently available ultrasound system . Since almost decennium , contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CE-US ) gaseous ultrasound contrast agent use research purpose also widely commercially available registered clinical use , do safely . With help gaseous contrast medium contain air bubble small erythrocyte ( microbubbles ) might possible depict neovascularisation carotid artery plaque , due strong signal evoke even small number air bubble compare signal surround tissue . So , intensity increase ultrasound signal carotid artery plaque administration microbubbles might reflect amount neovascularisation . Until , case report concern technique publish , especially comparison histology perform . So , first goal study investigate whether CE-US able accurately identify quantify neovascularisation carotid artery plaque . Since one first study systematically evaluate ability ultrasound combination air bubble evaluate neovascularisation carotid artery plaque , examination perform twice interval 1/2 hour day surgery , thus study reliability method . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) well suit evaluate carotid plaque ; widely available , provide excellent soft tissue contrast , multiplanar imaging capability , free ionising radiation . Multisequence MRI show able detect different carotid plaque component vivo . However , little experience exist identify neovascularisation MRI . Also , new MRI system ( &gt; 1.5 T ) , new coil system , good pulse sequence recently become available . Therefore , second goal study investigate whether MRI 3.0 T custom-designed 3T carotid coil , use recently develop pulse sequence , able accurately identify quantify neovascularisation . Finally , third goal study make intermodality comparison CE-US MRI regard ability identify quantify plaque neovascularisation .</detailed_description>
