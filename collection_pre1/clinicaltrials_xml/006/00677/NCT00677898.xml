	<brief_title>A Patient-Centered Approach Improve Screening Side Effects Second Generation Antipsychotics ( SGAs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Background/Rationale : Second-generation antipsychotic ( SGA ) medication widely use treat psychotic disorder associate metabolic side effect weight gain , glucose dysregulation , hyperlipidemia may contribute high rate cardiovascular disease observe individual serious mental illness ( SMI ) . Adherence guideline regular screen metabolic side effect SGAs inadequate . Patient-centered care , characterize effective partnership clinician patient promotes active participation patient care , improve health outcome satisfaction general population . In order increase rate screen metabolic side effect SGAs , propose design patient-centered computerized tool provide veteran SMI personalize health information well care adheres screen recommendation . The computerized tool use principle show enhance usability person cognitive impairment . Project Objectives : The objective study determine effect exposure patient-centered computerized tool compare enhanced treatment usual ( e-TAU ) : ( 1 ) rate screen identification health problem associate metabolic side effect SGAs ; ( 2 ) pattern patient-centered communication around screen metabolic side effect VA patient ' self-efficacy communicating psychiatrist screen ; ( 3 ) VA patient ' preference obtain health information participate decision-making screening ; ( 4 ) VA patient ' perception psychiatrist ' participatory decision-making style around screen . Project Methods : A total 240 veteran psychotic disorder prescribe SGAs regular contact prescribe clinician outpatient mental health clinic VA Maryland Health Care System recruit randomize control trial . Half participant randomly assign intervention condition view brief computer program provide personalized health information adherence guideline screen metabolic side effect design facilitate discussion psychiatrist appropriate screening . The half participant receive enhance treatment-as-usual ( e-TAU ) consist print information metabolic side effect SGAs general recommendation screen . Participants expose intervention e-TAU 3 time immediately prior visit prescriber one-year study period . Rates screen metabolic side effect SGAs obtain patient ' computerized medical record . A single prescriber visit participant audiotaped coded Roter Interaction Analysis System ( RIAS ) characterize pattern patient-clinician communication around screen metabolic side effect . Baseline 12-month follow-up interview assessment veteran use acquire information self-efficacy , preference obtain health information participate decision regard side effect screening , important covariates severity psychiatric illness .</detailed_description>
