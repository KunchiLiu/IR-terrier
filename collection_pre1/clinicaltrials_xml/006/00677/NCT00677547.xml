	<brief_summary>Influenza virus important cause morbidity transplant population lead viral bacterial pneumonia . Although annual influenza vaccine recommend organ transplant patient , study show standard inactivate influenza vaccine poor immunogenicity population . One major hurdle evaluation response influenza vaccine immunocompromised patient lack correlation humoral response efficacy vaccine . In patient poor immune response , cellular immunity may better correlation humoral immunity vaccine protection . We plan assess utility 3 assays evaluate cell-mediated immune response ( granzyme B , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , interferon-gamma ( IFN- ) ) influenza vaccine kidney transplant recipient . Results study potential directly improve patient care . The new monitoring assay may accurately determine risk development influenza infection , therefore allow good prevention strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There limited prospective data influenza infection transplant recipient . However , influenza significant cause morbidity mortality organ transplant population . Reported attack rate vary considerably likely due difference transplant population , immunosuppression protocol , exposure , type virulence circulate influenza virus . Complications influenza infection appear common solid organ transplant ( SOT ) population . There appear relatively high rate progression viral pneumonia report especially lung transplant recipient . In one study organ transplant recipient 10-year period , rate influenza infection range 2.8 cases/1000 person year ( liver transplant ) 41.8 cases/1000 person year ( lung transplant ) . Complications include secondary bacterial pneumonia ( 17 % ) well extrapulmonary complication myocarditis , myositis observe . Influenza ( respiratory viral infection ) may lead important immunological sequela result graft rejection and/or graft dysfunction . This may secondary activation immunological mechanism , include upregulation pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α , IL-6 IL-8 . Some study kidney liver recipient report high incidence acute rejection follow infection influenza . However , association influenza infection rejection report , causal relationship yet establish . Influenza vaccination become standard care several population group . The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Canadian National Advisory Committee Immunization ( NACI ) currently recommend vaccine child &gt; 6 month , healthy adult , elderly immunocompromised patient organ transplant ( www.cdc.gov ) . The currently available influenza vaccine subunit vaccine contain purified surface glycoprotein virus , hemagglutinin neuraminidase . The vaccine contain 15g antigen 2 circulate subtypes influenza A 15 g influenza B subtype ( www.who.int ) . The vaccine administer intramuscular route , generally deltoid muscle adult . The standard dose 0.5 mL . Annual influenza vaccination currently consider main strategy prevent influenza infection organ transplant recipient . However , large number study show immunogenic response vaccine suboptimal range 15-70 % . This number vary depend organ transplant immunosuppressive regimen use . Indeed , study kidney transplant recipient , especially pediatric population , show similar response influenza vaccine healthy control . Monitoring immune response influenza vaccine . Laboratory monitor response influenza vaccine do hemagglutination inhibition assay . Although laboratory serology surrogate marker protection , widely use . This primarily due large number patient would need show vaccine efficacy document influenza infection use outcome . The HIA also use World Health Organization validate annual vaccine . However , know criterion use general population may apply immunocompromised patient . In fact , elderly clearly proved standard cutoff antibody level 40 unit protect influenza . In study 397 elderly vaccinate influenza , 60 % person develop influenza antibody level 40 unit . To knowledge , absolute titer antibody require confer significant protection illness unknown transplant patient . Cell-mediated immunity influenza vaccination . Recently , specific cellular response also implicate protection influenza , independently humoral response . Cellular mediate immunity evaluate measure IL-2 IFN- ( T-helper type 1 response ) , IL-10 ( T-helper type 2 response ) , granzyme B expression ( correlate lytic activation ) . The cell-mediated immune response mainly use evaluate response influenza vaccine elderly . In study 90 person &gt; 60 year-old , IFN-/IL-10 ratio granzyme B level significantly high person develop influenza follow-up , compare person develop influenza . There correlation antibody level risk develop influenza infection . In previous study , granzyme B level find high young people old people . Taken together , data suggest cell-mediated immune response may correlate good risk influenza vaccination . The cell-mediated immune response influenza vaccine assess one study involve solid organ recipient . Mazzone et al . evaluate 43 lung transplant recipient 21 healthy control . IL-2 , IL-10 , IFN- , granzyme B level increase pre- post-vaccination lung transplant group . Both pre- post-cytokine level lower transplant group compare control group . The study propose prospective cohort trial design assess immunogenicity standard influenza vaccination measure cellular immunity cohort kidney transplant recipient , correlate standard humoral immunity .</detailed_description>
