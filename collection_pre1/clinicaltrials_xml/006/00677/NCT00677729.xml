All subsequent therapy , need , sole discretion attend physician . The family recruit subject contact phone 7 day later assess resolution symptom presence unexpected adverse effect . Clinical response treatment also determine independently study physician designate utilize standardized respiratory score system , Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument ( RDAI ) , study entry post-treatment observation period .

The infant remain ER throughout study period receive standard ongoing monitoring nursing staff .
