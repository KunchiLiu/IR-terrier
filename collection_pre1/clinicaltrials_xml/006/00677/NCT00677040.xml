	<brief_summary>This study involve woman diagnosis breast cancer , lumpectomy radiation treatment complete past year . The study determine level oxygen skin breast radiate , compare normal skin opposite breast . The purpose study determine decrease oxygen level skin radiate , hopefully find treatment limit skin damage cause radiation treatment , woman breast cancer future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Normal Tissue Oxygenation Following Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful completion study provide data change oxygenation irradiate tissue . If change document , study would provide evidence support current model tissue injury follow radiotherapy . In addition , data may provide mechanistic rationale clinical approach ameliorate toxicity radiotherapy . Finally , correlation exists tissue oxygenation toxicity , rapid simple tissue oxygenation test may provide quantitative measure toxicity allow earlier precise assessment toxicity efficacy ameliorative therapy .</detailed_description>
