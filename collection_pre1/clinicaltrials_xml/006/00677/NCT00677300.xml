	<brief_title>Raltegravir And Darunavir Antiretroviral Antiretroviral Naive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY RATIONALE : The current guideline HIV treatment antiretroviral naive patient recommend use two drug nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) class addition one drug protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) class . NRTI use associate significant toxicity , include mitochondrial dysfunction ( mostly attribute thymidine-analogue NRTIs ) : lipoatrophy , peripheral neuropathy , pancreatitis , lactic acidosis . There 's also significant risk hypersensitivity reaction Abacavir , caution need use Tenofovir patient renal failure . Finding effective NRTI-free regimen would number potential benefit include : 1 ) significant expansion therapeutic option ; despite grow number antiretrovirals , treatment option might still significantly limited patient number baseline NRTI mutation poor NRTI tolerance ; 2 ) potential avoidance toxicity . Raltegravir lead candidate new class antiretroviral medication call integrase inhibitor . It currently approve use antiretroviral treatment experience patient , show excellent virologic efficacy naïve well heavily treatment experienced patient . It also show unusually rapid virologic response . This profile might excellent delay emergence viral resistance naïve patient . Three phase III trial Raltegravir treatment experience patient conduct ( BENCHMRK trial ) . In study , 75 percent patient receive Raltegravir plus optimize background therapy ( OBT ) achieve viral load ( HIV RNA ) reduction less 400 copies/mL compare 40 percent patient receive placebo plus OBT . Both study also show Raltegravir plus OBT generally well tolerate . Darunavir currently approve use HAART-experienced patient dose 600 mg bid ritonavir boost . In subgroup analysis BENCHMRK trial , use Raltegravir Darunavir associate 90 % virologic response ( HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL ) 24 week treatment experienced subject . Also , recently present ARTEMIS study find once-daily Darunavir non-inferior either once- twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir antiretroviral naïve patient . After 48 week time-to-loss-of-virologic response analysis determine 84 % assign darunavir 78 % assign lopinavir viral load 50 copy . In subgroup analysis , DRV/r QD superior LPV/r ( overall ) patient baseline viral load ≥100,000 copies/mL Furthermore , DRV/r QD group experience low incidence lipid abnormality lopinavir/ritonavir group . HYPOTHESES We hypothesize virologic efficacy ( time loss virologic response ) 48 week least high follow regimen Raltegravir + boost Darunavir regimen Tenofovir + Emtricitabine + boost Darunavir . We hypothesize regimen Raltegravir + boost Darunavir result high rate adverse event 48 week regimen Tenofovir + Emtricitabine + boost Darunavir . STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION This randomize , active Control , safety/efficacy study . All eligible patient ( antiretroviral naïve , ) randomize ( 1:1 ) two treatment group : 1 . Group A : receive Raltegravir + Ritonavir-boosted Darunavir 2 . Group B : receive Tenofovir + Emtricitabine + Ritonavir-boosted Darunavir</detailed_description>
