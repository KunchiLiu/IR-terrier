	<detailed_description>NASH clinico-pathological entity characterize development histological change inflammation fibrosis liver nearly identical induced excessive alcohol intake , absence alcohol abuse . Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis occur commonly child additional comorbidities obesity diabetes mellitus . Paralleling increase prevalence obesity type 2 diabetes pediatric population , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) especially severe histological form NASH , expect become one common cause end-stage liver disease child young adult . Although genome wide association study conduct association NASH date , individual candidate gene investigation identify several gene associate increase susceptibility NASH adult include microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTP ) regulate incorporation triglyceride apolipoprotein B key enzyme assembly secretion VLDL hepatocytes , manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) gene catalyzes conversion two molecule superoxide anion , highly unstable ROS , hydrogen peroxide oxygen stable ROS , lastly , phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ( PEMT ) require hepatic secretion triacylglycerol low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) . We propose follow aim : Aim 1 : To document frequency specific genotype , previously identify associate adult-onset NASH , purely pediatric cohort . Aim 2 : To investigate whether genotype associate increased susceptibility NASH increase occurrence fibrosis cohort pediatric subject . Our hypothesis would : A significantly high proportion polymorphism would exist subject NASH compare control . Aim 3 : To investigate presence polymorphism biomarker indicative pediatric NASH . Such secondary hypothesis would : Specific polymorphism biomarkers identify indicate high probability NASH .</detailed_description>
