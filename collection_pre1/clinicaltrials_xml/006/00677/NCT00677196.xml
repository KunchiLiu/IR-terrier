	<brief_title>The StoneBreakerTM Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study compare LMA StoneBreakerTM current standard pneumatic lithotripsy , Swiss LithoClastR , percutaneous nephrolithotripsy ( PNL ) . Rationale : Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy ( PNL ) prefer treatment modality renal stone great 2cm diameter . The pneumatic lithotriptor function pneumatic jackhammer , provide either single pulse train pulse 2Hz determined operator . Its chief advantage ability fragment even hard calculus . The pneumatic lithotriptor , extremely effective , utilize thermal energy therefore risk thermal damage surround tissue . The pneumatic lithotriptor currently use , Swiss LithoClast power compressed medical air . The primary disadvantage device residual calculus must individually remove forceps follow fragmentation . The StoneBreaker , manufacture Laryngeal Mask Airway Company , novel hand-held pneumatic lithotriptor . This device power compressed carbon dioxide cartridge . Hypothesis : The LMA StoneBreaker , provide efficient lithotripsy renal calculus treat PNL exist pneumatic intracorporeal lithotriptor Swiss LithoClast . Methods : Patients would recruit study clinical population present stone management VGH . None physician involve financial interest either device evaluate . The purpose compare pneumatic lithotripsy device evaluation PNL , procedure whose safety efficacy well establish . Patients consent PNL management renal stone would approach entry study either primary surgeon , research coordinator , research fellow . Patients would understand PNL experimental procedure research project specifically compare two lithotripsy device similar mechanism action safety profile . The goal case would render patient stone free . The patient care would deviate standard PNL care protocol , summarize , exception use different lithoclast . Pre-operatively , patient assess Preanaesthetic clinic necessary . Blood test include CBC differential , blood type antibody screen , creatinine electrolyte routinely obtain . Urine sample send preoperatively culture sensitivity . If urine culture positive , organism specific antibiotic prescribed prior treatment . If urine culture negative , prophylactic antibiotic order administer , prior induction anaesthesia , treat surgeon . Our standard operative protocol PNL describe next followed case . After receive general anaesthetic , cystoscopy placement ureteral catheter affect side may perform . The used perform retrograde pyelography order determine optimal access site kidney . A Foley catheter place drain bladder throughout procedure . Next , fluoroscopic guidance , access affect renal collecting system obtain needle guide wire pass interventional radiology department operate surgeon . The tract dilate accommodate 30F work sheath . The stone visualize fragment either two device , determine randomization . Remaining fragment remove use grasp forceps ultrasound suction device patient render stone free . A final visual inspection collect system ensure patient stone free . The choice renal drainage method procedure leave discretion treat surgeon . Statistical Analysis : Student 's t-test ANOVA use determine statistical significance . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
