	<detailed_description>Background Spirometry useful clinical tool assessment monitoring obstructive lung disease provide information underlie mechanism cause obstruction . The role increase airflow resistance assess body plethysmography , technique require elaborate equipment , skilled operator considerable subject co-operation . A much simpler technique , impulse oscillometry ( IOS ) provide extensive assessment pulmonary mechanic . With IOS small volume oscillation apply mouth ordinary tidal breathing ; instantaneous pressure/flow signal produce imposed oscillation ( impedance , Zrs ) analyze in-phase ( resistance , Rrs ) out-of-phase ( reactance , Xrs ) component . Because Rrs measure range frequency , IOS potential distinguish large small airway resistance . Changes Xrs less study , suggestion also may distinguish different type airflow obstruction . Objectives The main objective study investigate ability IOS measure small airway disease provide different impedance profile patient asthma COPD . Even though patient asthma may show reduction calibre small airway change feature patient COPD . We hypothesize frequency dependent change IOS resistance enable u identify patient COPD expect low frequency impedance high compare patient asthma . Furthermore , view increase lung compliance characterize COPD patient expect reactance , IOS measurement reflect lung elastance , elevate compare asthmatic subject . Another objective study investigate relationship small airway resistance inflammation . The measurement exhale nitric oxide ( FENO ) , marker inflammation , multiple exhalation flow rate allow partition NO produced central airway generate peripheral lung . We investigate relationship level peripheral airway NO small airway resistance assess IOS plethysmography . Furthermore , would like measure bronchial blood flow ( Qaw ) also marker inflammation may play role narrow small airway</detailed_description>
