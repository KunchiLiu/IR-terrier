	<brief_title>A Safety Dose-finding Study JNJ-26481585 Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies Lymphoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JNJ-24681585 histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor . It drug development treatment cancer . In study , safety ( effect body ) drug patient advance refractory solid malignancy lymphoma study . The maximum dose tolerate patient determine . The absorption , break , elimination drug study patient effect food process examine . Antitumor activity JNJ-26481585 evaluate . JNJ-26481585 administer continuous regimen 21-day treatment cycle . The dose JNJ-26481585 start low increase study group 2 6 patient . The dose patient receives study entry increase , patient receive drug later enrollment time may receive high dose . If group patient severe side effect , next group patient get high dose . The dose increase patient severe side effect . The dose decrease dose level severe side effect observe less 1/3 patient . Once safe dose level determine additional group 12-24 patient treat . The amount JNJ-26481585 blood measure effect disease evaluate patient . In patient , effect food absorption , break , elimination study drug also study . Patients screen eligibility within 4 week study treatment give . The treatment consist 21-day treatment cycle continuous daily dose regimen . The duration treatment depend adverse effect whether benefit treatment . The design cycle may adjust course study include day treatment ( pause ) guide clinical observation . The dose regimen may adjust twice daily three time daily intake guided information rapidly body break eliminate study drug . Patients informed change design cycle dose regimen . During first treatment cycle , patient require stay hospital 3 4 night . In addition 8 9 daytime visit Cycles 1 2 ( combine ) may take 12 hour morning dose 2 3 occasion 4 hour morning dose 6 occasion . From Cycle 3 onwards , 1 daytime visit per treatment cycle , visit usually take less time . Throughout study , especially Cycles 1 2 , patient undergo frequent blood urine test , procedure assess safety include heart function , test assess course patient illness . Two week last dose study drug , patient require return study site follow-up assessment . JNJ-26481585 provide capsule take mouth daily throughout treatment . The start dose level 2 mg dose receive individual patient determine time enrollment . Modifications treatment schedule dose regimen may explore course study . Patients continue receive treatment long benefit evaluate study doctor unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
