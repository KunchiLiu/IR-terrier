	<brief_summary>Background : During repair process deep venous thrombosis , capillary formation see day 18 day 25 . Contrast agent investigation well know detect small vessel arterial disease . We intend use method detect early vascularisation thrombus , order get information evolution thrombosis vivo . Aims study : Investigation newly diagnose occlude venous thrombus duplexsonography , use contrast agent compare degree vascularization patient 3 week 3 month . The relative signal intensity difference ( baseline peak ) time intensity curve ( TIC ) measure defined region interest ( ROI ) . Comparison visibility revascularisation color duplexsonography , power mode contrast agent do . Method : Patients venous thrombosis proximal limb vein ( femoral popliteal vein ) investigate ultrasound agent supine position . 5 ml contrast agent sulfur hexafluoride give intravenously vein dorsal foot . The measurement do defined area , thrombus fully occlude color Doppler investigation . The region interest vessel wall centre thrombus cross section view . The signal intensity measure baseline peak ( decibel ) centre peripheral part vein . 20 patient acute deep venous thrombosis include pilot study investigate baseline , 3 week 3 month . Previously ( contrast agent application ) , vein investigate color - power Doppler test visibility comparison contrast agent investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Venous Thrombus Investigation With Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study set Study design It open , non-randomized prospective clinical pilot study ass value contrast agent venous thrombus investigation . a. Hypothesis - The relative signal intensity increase decibel intravenous contrast medium injection tool measure thrombus - revascularization , assess defined region interest thrombus small acute occluding ( &lt; 2 week ) thrombosis compare follow measurement 3 month patient . - Visibility revascularization increase contrast agent compare color Doppler - power Doppler investigation assess 2 independent investigator 2 . Methods 1 . Clinical investigation All patient subject investigate clinically . The patient 's family history well present past history deep venous thrombosis assess . The first day symptom deep vein thrombosis note . The thromboembolic disease assess clinically use Wells ' score . In addition pulse dorsal foot artery palpate . Height weight assess well medication intake , especially dose type anticoagulation therapy . Laboratory test include C-reactive protein D-Dimer test visit 1 , 2 3 , well thrombophilia screen ( anti-thrombin , anti protein C resistance , protein C , protein S , Lupus anticoagulans , prothrombinfragment 1 2 , factor II mutation G 202 10 A ) 2 . Duplexsonography investigation All patient proximal deep venous thrombosis evaluate study inclusion . The eligible patient investigate supine position leg B-mode - compression sonography Doppler spectral analysis . The vein segment consider affect incompressible Doppler spectrum assessable . The proximal fully occlude thrombus area ( color mode ) define localization measure cm groin popliteal line . The particular area interest investigate cross section color duplex sonography power Doppler use linear wideband scan head L7 ( 5-12 MHz ) duplexsonography device GE LOGIC 9 ( GE Healthcare Technologies , Ultrasound Milwaukee , WI , USA ) . One cineloop 20 second save real time assessment . The sequence save avi - dicom - format Doppler specification . The saved film evaluate offline two different investigator use visibility score . Duplexsonography investigation contrast agent : Five ml contrast agent sulfur hexafluoride ( = SonoVueTM , Bracco International B.V. , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) give intravenously superficial vein dorsal foot calf leg investigate ( green butterfly needle 20 gauge ) . If leg vein available arm vein route use . The measurement do fully occlude thrombus area cross section . The area localize order find point investigation visit 2 visit 3 . The following setting apply case contrast agent investigation : Contrast program preset low mechanical index ( MI ) &lt; 0.13 ( acoustic output 4 % ) , depth 4 - 5 cm , one focus zone adapt depth investigate vein area , dynamic range 72 , pulse repetition interval 1.25 , B ( brightness- ) -mode amplification 30 . The ultrasound pulse trigger . An optimized manual technique apply minimize movement artefact . After 10 second B-mode assessment , bolus 5 ml SonoVueTM solution inject peripheral foot calf vein use butterfly needle ( 20 gauge ) . The SonoVueTM - injection follow immediately 10 ml saline bolus flush injection line . The investigation document digital save cineloops avi- dicom format . Image analysis perform offline , use time intensity curve ( TIC ) analysis program provide GE Healthcare Technologies , implement LOGIQ 9 ultrasound system . Using ultrasound raw data , image display acoustic intensity measure decibel ( dB ) acquisition time manually defined region interest ( ROI ) i.e . vessel wall intraluminal thrombus cross section . The signal intensity measure baseline peak ( decibel ) centre peripheral part vein . The difference calculate . Measurements do 3 time , mean value use calculation . 20 patient acute deep venous thrombosis symptom onset within last 2 week include pilot study . The patient follow 3 month , parameter assess compare intraindividually . 3 . Visibility score The three document investigation patient color - power Doppler-mode well contrast agent assessment evaluate two different blind person , experience ultrasound investigation ( &gt; 2000 ultrasound investigation , specialty degree ultrasound investigation IP DG ) . The visibility score accord one described Gehrig et al assess . The score compare 2 investigator well 3 investigation mode . 4 . Inclusion criterion - Age &gt; 18 &lt; 80 year old - Given write informed consent - Patients symptoms deep venous thrombosis le 2 week - Thrombus occlude without reperfusion color mode common femoral vein ( CFV ) , femoral vein ( FV ) popliteal vein ( PV ) 5 . Exclusion criterion - Arterial occlusive disease - Acute myocardial infarction , symptom coronary artery disease - Pregnancy - History stroke transient ischemic attack - Arterial hypertension uncontrolled - Allergy contrast medium - Participation another study - Right heart insufficiency ( clinical assessment jugular vein fill 45° sit position ) 3 . Study Endpoints Primary study endpoint : Detection - vascularization &gt; 3 month old thrombosis patient initially occlude vein , assess ultrasound contrast agent , parameter use difference baseline peak time intensity curve . Secondary study endpoint : Visibility newly develop small vessel patient occlude thrombus assessment application contrast agent , color Doppler power Doppler mode . The parameter use visibility score . 4 . Sample size Sample size estimate 9 patient group assume significant difference 4.7 % mean value `` time peak '' patient acute compare chronic thrombosis significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 power 95 % ( beta ) assume standard deviation 2 . Sample size calculation perform use Graphpad Prism 4.0b StatMate 2 . 5 . Statistics All parameter analyze independent unit . Statistical analysis calculate use Stat View software package version 5.0 Mac OS 9 ( Stat View Software Abacus C. , Berkley , California ) Graph Pad Prism version 4 Mac OS X ( Graph Pad Software , San Diego , California ) . Results give median interquartile range . Comparison visit patient do non-parametric , paired Wilcoxon sign rank test two group involve Kruskal Wallis test . A probability level &lt; 0.05 consider significant . The inter - reader agreement measure use kappa value .</detailed_description>
