	<brief_summary>We establish Telemedicine System chronic disease management . Based personal health record , successfully used system diverse population , 600 patient , multiple disease state ( heart failure , CVD risk reduction , gestational diabetes ) . In proposal , enhance Telemedicine system support patient center care ( PCC ) increase access , incorporate hypertension treatment guideline , quality measure , automate reminder feedback patient health care provider . Inner-city , primarily African-American patient ( N=252 ) uncontrolled hypertension ( BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg ) follow primary care physicians randomize either usual care telemedicine group ( Telemedicine plus usual care ) . Blood pressure , weight , BMI , blood glucose lipid , physical activity measure baseline 6 month . We hypothesize subject telemedicine group achieve goal blood pressure control group . This occur increase knowledge , self-management , share decision-making , improve doctor-patient interaction . Primary end- point proportion subject achieve goal blood pressure . Secondary end-points include : Rate self-monitoring , step per day , weight , CVD knowledge , number patient medication guideline , increased satisfaction practice . Telemedicine utilization also determine . We believe telemedicine facilitate PCC reduce blood pressure cost effective manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Telemedicine System Promote Patient Care Among Underserved Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basic demographic information obtain subject . The subject 's primary care physician 's name , contact information , specialty record . All patient initial medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood study , urinalysis , height , weight , blood pressure measurement . Blood pressure measurement obtain leave arm seat participant 5 minute quiet rest . A minimum 3 BP reading take . Systolic diastolic BP record . Waist circumference measure near 1 cm level iliac crest subject stand minimal respiration . A fasting blood sample obtain determine serum cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglyceride , creatinine , glucose level . All participant receive value together brochure regard life-style modification ( weight loss , smoke cessation , increase physical activity etc appropriate ) . The subject take cardiovascular knowledge questionnaire CAHPSÂ® Clinician &amp; Group Survey ( CAHPS 2006 ) . Control Patients . Management patient 's medical condition do patient 's primary care physician . No restriction place patient care number office visit physician ( ) . If subject primary care physician , arrange subject follow Temple base primary care practice . At final visit 6 month , control patient give opportunity follow telemedicine system . Computer Training : Patients randomized telemedicine group train use computer Internet access Internet web-site . Each patient instruct detail Telemedicine system demonstration terminal research center . At time , patient provide login name password gain access secure telemedicine site . The patient make data entry coach research team . An important feature Telemedicine system telephone-based data entry communication . This added current Internet-based system use Interactive Voice Recognition ( IVR ) system , enable information transmit via telephone Internet collect central database . Training use IVR system ( i.e. , respond prompt ) incorporate patient train program Internet . The study patient randomized telemedicine group give sphygmomanometer memory , scale need , pedometer count step per day . The participant receive instruction regard proper use device . Initially , subject wear pedometer 7 consecutive day record total number step take day obtain baseline physical activity level . The participant give recommendation gradual progression toward 10,000 steps/day . Ten thousand step per day consistent approximately 5 mile walk per day . All participant give logbook encourage record measurement least week ( i.e. , blood pressure , weight , average number step ) course study . Life style change , increase exercise weight loss , make significant impact blood pressure ; weight loss little 10 lbs reduce blood pressure . Patients telemedicine group also provide toll-free number access IVR system ( separate toll-free number provide Hispanic patient Spanish language IVR system ) . This system use alternate web-based data entry screen available patient Internet arm . Basically , patient dial 800 number voice message ask patient ID password ( character string enter via telephone keypad speak sequence ) . The numerical value blood pressure , step , weight , cigarettes smoke entered via voice recognition keypad . Voice message patient also permit . These spoken prompt , design provide short ( i.e . 1 minute ) voice transmission store voice file ( WAV ) telemedicine system database . Data enter via IVR system insert patient 's personal health record store Telemedicine database .</detailed_description>
