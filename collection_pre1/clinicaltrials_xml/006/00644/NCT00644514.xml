	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify mediator gene airway epithelial BAL cell differentially regulate follow inhalation endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) among study participant allergic asthma normal phenotype . This approach design identify novel gene associate asthma pathogenesis asthma susceptibility . LPS , endotoxin , cell wall component gram-negative bacteria , ubiquitous environment , think influence susceptibility severity asthma . 240 subject ( healthy adult men woman ( age &gt; 18-40 ) without atopy asthma ) complete screen evaluation order establish 3 study group 60 subject . Each qualify subject undergo inhale LPS endotoxin challenge follow bronchoscopy 24 hour , consist bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) endobronchial brush biopsy . BAL involve squirt small amount sterile salt water one airways gently take back bronchoscope . The brush sample involve gently move small brush back forth airway collect cell sample . Samples whole blood also obtain various time point . RNA isolate cell population order ass differential gene expression expression use microarrays .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , cell wall component gram-negative bacteria , ubiquitous environment , often present high concentration organic dust , well air pollution , household dust . There convince evidence endotoxin exacerbate airflow obstruction airway inflammation allergic asthmatic . Additional finding indicate allergic airway enhance response inhaled endotoxin , endotoxin enhance airway response allergen . However , consider interaction endotoxin allergen , time exposure appear critical . Emerging evidence suggest early exposure endotoxin , potent inducer Th1 type cytokine ( IFN-g IL-12 ) , may minimize risk allergen sensitization could profound effect reduce risk develop asthma child . Independent effect allergic asthma , several study demonstrate inhalation air contaminate endotoxin associate classical feature asthma ( reversible airflow obstruction airway inflammation , persistent airway hyperreactivity airway remodel ) . Epidemiological study show concentration inhale endotoxin bioaerosol strongly consistently associate reversible airflow obstruction among cotton worker , agricultural worker , fiberglass worker . Importantly , concentration endotoxin bioaerosol important occupational exposure associate development progression airway disease agricultural worker . Experimentally , inhalation endotoxin cause reversible airflow obstruction airway inflammation previously unexposed healthy study subject . The ability host respond endotoxin highly variable , influenced part genetic factor . : The rationale investigation base follow point : - asthma cause large part genetic susceptibility environmental exposure , - variety immune non-immune mechanism function independently interactively cause airway hyper-reactivity , airflow obstruction , airway inflammation , airway remodel , - environmental challenge use `` narrow asthma phenotype '' allow one investigate unique gene-environment interaction involve development biologically specific form asthma , - gene stimulate airway epithelia asthmatic follow inhalation challenge important pathogenesis asthma</detailed_description>
