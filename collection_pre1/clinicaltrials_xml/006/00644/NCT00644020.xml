	<detailed_description>- Patients sign Informed Consent Form eligible entry criterion randomly assign either TYROSERLEUTIDE treatment group placebo group . No matter group subject assign , he/she would receive chemotherapy treatment portal vein pump transplant carcinoma section surgery 40 day randomization . - Participants give either TYROSERLEUTIDE placebo intravenous injection interval 29 day , participant take investigational drug anti-tumor treatment well . On day next completion cycle research treatment usually last 3-5 day , participant receive medical inspection observe ensure drug safety . - Participants continue receive investigational drug 6 cycle detect recurrence metastasis tumor experience serious side effect . - A CT scan MRI scan perform participant exclude recurrence metastasis tumor assess effect treatment initiation new cycle .</detailed_description>
