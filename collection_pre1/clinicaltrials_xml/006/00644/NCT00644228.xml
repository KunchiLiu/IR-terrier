	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study lenalidomide , dexamethasone , bortezomib see well work compare dexamethasone lenalidomide alone treat patient previously untreated multiple myeloma . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . It yet know whether lenalidomide dexamethasone effective without bortezomib treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Dexamethasone With Without Bortezomib Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient newly diagnose myeloma treat lenalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone versus bortezomib plus lenalidomide low dose dexamethasone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess response use new international response criterion . II . To bank specimen future translational medicine research . III . Follow patient assess overall survival long-term outcome stratify intent transplant progression . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate custom genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms correlation biology , prognosis outcome treatment regimen combine ; verify finding recently obtain custom Bank Cure program ( BOAC ) single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) chip Total Therapy 2 ( TT2 ) data respect bone disease cooperative group set . II . To use baseline gene expression profile tool evaluate biology , prognostic risk factor , response therapy treatment regimen combine . To validate John Shaughnessy 's 70 gene risk model develop Total Therapy 2 ( TT2 ) cooperative group set . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive dexamethasone orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive dexamethasone PO QD day 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 ; lenalidomide PO QD day 1-14 ; bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , patient intend undergo transplantation relapse undergo peripheral blood stem cell collection , preferably course 2 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : After completion least 4 course ( Arm I ) least 6 course ( Arm II ) induction therapy , patient receive maintenance therapy comprise dexamethasone PO QD day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 6 year .</detailed_description>
