	<brief_summary>A significant subset patient scapula fracture also involve glenoid neck ( bone join shoulder joint scapular body ) . There little evidence pertain best treatment precise definition lesion . This study design prospective , non-randomized cohort study collect outcome radiological data patient sustained fracture glenoid neck ( bone join shoulder joint scapular body ) period 1 year . All patient sustain extraarticular scapula fracture ( fracture involve glenoid surface ) consider . Information collect respect radiographic characteristic osseous injury well functional outcome time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes Following Glenoid Neck Fracture Correlated With Quantitative Assessment Osseous Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extraarticular fracture ( fracture involve glenoid articular surface ) scapula ( shoulder blade ) traditionally manage nonoperatively . The logic course treatment base heal potential extensive muscular envelop scapula , inherent mobility shoulder joint , difficulty objectively assess degree injury give irregular osseous architecture . Scapular fracture specifically involve glenoid neck potential significantly change geometry glenohumeral joint ( shoulder joint ) well affect action muscle nerve act across . Although report indicate patient sustain glenoid neck fracture well follow nonoperative treatment , little use validate outcome measure . Additionally , context severe trauma may lead underestimation functional recovery . Advances image technology combine evolution internal fixation technique result sporadic attempt fixation glenoid neck fracture , usually occur concert bony injury member shoulder girdle , `` float shoulder '' . However , absence universal canon radiograph measurement , current recommendation operative versus non-operative management base characteristic osseous injury correlate probable clinical outcome . Moreover , common assertion nonoperative management scapular fracture lead adequate functional outcome rigorously examine prospective fashion , despite standard care nationally . Recent evidence suggest nonoperative treatment may lead significant decrease strength forelimb function despite fact standard care vast majority injury involve surgery reduction . The may true glenoid neck fracture , significant shorten angulation metaphyseal isthmus may detrimental effect functional geometry glenohumeral ( shoulder ) joint . If , surgical management may indicate restore physiologic geometry joint , thereby give best chance recovery pre-injury level function . It hope correlate measurement outcome help codify priori set radiograph evaluation criterion help guide decision surgical versus non-operative management glenoid neck fracture . The purpose study : 1 ) define degree forelimb dysfunction bring specific injury 2 ) magnitude osseous injury glenoid neck tolerate functional outcome unacceptably impede .</detailed_description>
