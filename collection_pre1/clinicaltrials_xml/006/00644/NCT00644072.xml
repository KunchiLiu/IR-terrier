	<brief_summary>Background : SNX-5422 experimental drug inhibits protein call Hsp90 , important growth tumor cell . SNX-5422 show activity tumor laboratory animal study . Objectives : To determine high safe dose , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , SNX-5422 safely give patient solid tumor cancer lymphomas take twice week . To learn body 's blood tissue cell react SNX-5422 . To examine effect SNX-5422 tumor lymphomas . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old solid tumor cancer lymphomas respond standard therapy acceptable standard treatment available . Design : SNX-5422 take mouth twice week 28-day cycle . Treatment may continue long cancer worsen side effect acceptable . Three six patient enrol study time . Each group give high dose SNX-5422 previous , long precede dose tolerate MTD determine . When MTD find , six patient enrol dose level . During treatment period , patient undergo follow test procedure : - Clinic visit physical examination treatment cycle check health status . - Blood test routine laboratory value , determine body handle SNX-5422 , examine effect SNX-5422 blood cell target . - Urine test need , depend result blood test . - CT scan , image test every 8 week evaluate tumor response treatment . - Tumor biopsy ( surgical removal tissue sample examination microscope ) first dose SNX-5422 24 hour first dose see drug affect tumor . This test optional .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Inhibitors chaperone protein Hsp90 current interest central role Hsp90 play maturation maintenance numerous protein , Her2 , critical tumor cell viability growth . - Disruption Hsp90 function show cause degradation multiple Hsp90 client protein , lead inhibition several key signal pathway . This turn result inhibition cellular proliferation . Objectives : - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SNX-5422 administer twice week 28 day . - Characterize safety profile SNX-5422 administer twice week 28 day . - Investigate effect SNX-5422 Hsp90 client protein use pharmacodynamic ( PD ) assay . - Investigate effect SNX-5422 tumor lymphoma response use National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ) standardize lymphoma criterion , respectively . - Determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile SNX-2112 prodrug SNX-5422 human . Eligibility : - Patients histologically document solid tumor lymphoid malignancy ( lymphoma CLL ) whose disease progress follow standard therapy , acceptable standard treatment option . - Patients major surgery , radiation , chemotherapy within 4 week prior study enrollment , recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level . Design : This Phase I dose escalation study determine MTD recommend Phase II dose SNX-5422 . SNX-5422 administer orally twice week 28 day continuous cycle disease progression occur patient meet off-study criterion . Three six patient enrol dose level , 6 additional patient MTD , minimum 36 patient maximum 60 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients histologically document ( NIH pathology department ) solid tumor lymphoid malignancy ( lymphoma CLL ) refractory standard therapy acceptable standard treatment option . Patients lymphoid malignancy eligible disease progress follow 2 standard therapy ( aggressive NHL ) , disease consider refractory ( indolent NHL ) . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Patients must recover least Grade le equal to1 toxicity level due adverse event and/or toxicity prior chemotherapy biologic therapy . They must chemotherapy biologic therapy within 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , UCN01 ) . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND/Phase Zero study . Patients must great equal 1 month since prior radiation major surgery . However , patient receive bisphosphonates cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer eligible therapy . Age great equal 18 year The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) . Life expectancy great 3 month Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/milliliter Platelets great equal 100,000/milliliter Total bilirubin* within less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine le 1.5 time upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min ( measure ) patient creatinine level great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal . *we allow patient Gilbert 's syndrome total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL The effect SNX5422 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 2 month discontinuation study . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test order eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother SNX5422 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated SNX5422 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable least 3 month without steroid may enrol discretion principal investigator . Uncontrolled medical illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( AHA Class II worse ) , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible PK interaction SNX5422 . HIV positive patient receive antiretroviral therapy exclude due possibility SNX5422 may worsen condition likelihood underlying condition may obscure attribution adverse event respect SNX5422 . Chronic diarrhea . Gastrointestinal disease could affect drug absorption , include postsurgical state gastric bypass . Gastrointestinal disease could alter assessment safety , include irritable bowel syndrome , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , hemorrhagic coloproctitis .</criteria>
