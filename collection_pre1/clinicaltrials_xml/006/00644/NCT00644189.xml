	<brief_summary>Oral clofarabine relate two intravenous chemotherapy drug use disease work two different way . It affect development new cancer cell block two enzyme cancer cell need reproduce . When enzyme block , cancer call longer prepare DNA need make new cell . Clofarabine also encourage exist cancer cell die disturb component within cancer cell . This cause release substance fatal cell . The phase I component research study complete demonstrate encouraging safety efficacy low-grade B-cell lymphoma . The phase II component trial accrue study efficacy oral clofarabine treatment relapse non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
