	<brief_summary>The prevalence incidence end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) extremely high Taiwan ( 1 , 2 ) . More 45,000 patient renal replacement therapy year 2004 ( 2 ) . The disease cause significant impact personal life , also great burden social security government-run health insurance . However , despite high prevalence , awareness chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) general population remain low ( 3 , 4 ) . The patient always come late intervention slow progression renal failure . Furthermore , well prepared renal replacement therapy . The fact result high mortality morbidity specific population ( 5 ) . It mandatory screen treat patient early enough . However , patient deep community asymptomatic nature CKD . The major purpose study screen community early CKD provide appropriate intervention time . The study collect characteristic demographic epidemiological data find risk factor CKD geographic area , provide multidisciplinary education CKD establish timely referral appropriate nephrologist care treatment monitoring complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project last 3 year . We start screen patient within community identify CKD population . This population randomize two group ( one group standard nephrologist care another group standard nephrologist care plus multidisciplinary CKD education ) evaluate effectiveness CKD education progression renal function . The primary end-point double tine estimate GFR , development end-stage renal disease cause mortality . The non-CKD group community also follow urine blood test renal function , determine incidence risk factor new-onset renal disease . The accomplishment study retard renal progression , improve community health establish model prevent chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
