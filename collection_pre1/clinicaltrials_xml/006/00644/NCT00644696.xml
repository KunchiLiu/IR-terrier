	<detailed_description>In spite intensive treatment include high-dose chemotherapy autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation radiation therapy , long-term survival patient high-risk neuroblastoma remain poor . Patients experience relapse disease fail achieve complete remission fare even bad . More intense chemotherapy answer . The development new drug different mechanism action require . Inhibitors proteasome create considerable interest use cancer chemotherapy , either single agent combination chemotherapeutic agent . The precise mechanism action class drug unclear , however , inhibition I-kB degradation VELCADEÂ® ( bortezomib ) decrease NF-kB activity neuroblastoma cell line well system . Previous study report activity Irinotecan , strong Topoisomerase-I inhibitor , murine xenograft include high-risk feature MYCN gene amplification ( MYCN also call V-Myc Myelocytomatosis Viral Related Oncogene , Neuroblastoma Derived ) . Irinotecan also show active neuroblastoma xenograft resistant vincristine , melphalan , topotecan , suggest alternative mechanism resistance Irinotecan . In vitro synergy bortezomib irinotecan document pancreatic cancer others neuroblastoma group .</detailed_description>
