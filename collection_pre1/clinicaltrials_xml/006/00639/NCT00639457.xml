	<brief_summary>The purpose examine safety efficacy 16wks pioglitazone ( Actos ; 30mg/d ) without aerobic strength exercise training reduce glucose intolerance central adiposity HIV-infected people . We anticipate pioglitazone + exercise training improve glucose metabolism insulin sensitivity , reduce central adiposity pioglitazone alone . These improvement translate reduce cardiovascular disease risk HIV-infected people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our prior research examine pathogenesis potential treatment metabolic complication people live HIV . We adopt `` lipotoxicity '' hypothesis Metabolic Syndrome X explain pathogenesis impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) fat redistribution HIV : increase lipolysis mobilization lipid free fatty acid subcutaneous adipose depot lead excessive deposition muscle liver contribute dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , increase hepatic glucose output , possibly visceral fat accumulation . Effective treatment identify . Consensus group recommend regular exercise dietary modification primary pharmacologic intervention secondary treatment syndrome . We propose test efficacy aerobic weight lift exercise train oral insulin-sensitizing agent ( pioglitazone ) treatments HIV-associated IGT fat redistribution . We propose 4-month , 2-group randomize study evaluate efficacy pioglitazone exercise + pioglitazone 40 men 40 woman live HIV IGT fat redistribution . We measure : insulin sensitivity , glucose disposal rate , hepatic glucose production rate ( 5hr-hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp 6,6- [ 2H2 ] -glucose ) ; whole-body regional fat muscle content ( 1H-MRI abdomen thigh &amp; DEXA ) , soleus muscle liver lipid content ( 1H-MRS ) , muscle fat PPARgamma/alpha mRNA protein expression , serum lipid profile , serum adiponectin level end 4 month treatment . We hypothesize exercise training + pioglitazone effective pioglitazone alone improve insulin sensitivity , reduce visceral fat , liver muscle lipid content , increase peripheral subcutaneous fat content HIV-infected people . We hypothesize combine treatment effective exercise training activate PPARalpha expression muscle pioglitazone activate PPARy expression fat muscle . We anticipate project provide direct evidence support combine use exercise training pioglitazone people live HIV experience metabolic anthropomorphic disorder increase cardiovascular disease risk .</detailed_description>

Stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) may may include HIVprotease inhibitor least 3 month prior enrollment . As Jan 2005 , HIVinfected longterm nonprogressors include , even though receive HAART likely disease status advance study period . 4 . Impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) type 2 diabetes fat redistribution . IGT define : fasting ( 8hr ) plasma glucose 100126mg/dL plasma glucose &gt; 140 mg/dL 2hours 75goral glucose load . This definition ( proposed/revised May 2006 ) include volunteer adult onset type 2 diabetes ( noninsulin dependent diabetes ) , believe volunteer may benefit potential glucoselowering action pioglitazone without exercise training . Fat redistribution define 2 following : waisttohip ratio &gt; 0.85 woman &gt; 0.95 men , trunk/appendicular adipose ratio use wholebody DEXA &gt; 0.85 woman &gt; 1.3 men , &lt; 15 % leg fat ( DEXA ; ( leg fat/total body fat ) x100 ) , visceral adiposity VAT &gt; 120 cm2 woman &gt; 140 cm2 men , VAT/TAT ratio &gt; 0.30 woman &gt; 0.40 men . Overall , eligibility criterion design include subject metabolic syndrome increase CVD risk , potential gain great benefit pioglitazone exercise training . These inclusion criterion help select/maintain homogeneous group study participant . 5 . Plasma HIV RNA ( Roche Amplicor® assay ) &lt; 5000 copies/ml OR CD4 Tcell count &gt; 100 cells/µL stable previous 3 month . 6 . BMI 2040kg/m2 . 7 . `` Normal '' blood chemistry least 1 month prior enrollment ; platelet count &gt; 30,000/mm3 , absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750/mm3 , transaminase &lt; 2.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , creatinine &lt; 3x ULN , fast triglyceride &lt; 500 mg/dL . 1 . Medications agent might alter/impair glucose metabolism ( insulin , glucocorticoid , corticosteroid , megace ) 3 month prior enrollment time enrollment . Volunteers develop type 2 diabetes HIVinfection start antiHIV medication , receive insulin sensitizer ( metformin , meglitinides , alphaglucosidase inhibitor ) insulin secretagogues ( sulfonylurea ) , still blood sugar control ( define IGT ) eligible . 2 . Abnormal unstable ( 3 month prior enrollment ) endocrine blood chemistry might otherwise explain insulin resistance .
