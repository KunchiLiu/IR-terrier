	<brief_title>Safety Red Yeast Rice High Cholesterol Individuals With Statin Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 million Americans actively treated statin annual cost 16 billion dollar . Statins effective therapeutic agent reduce LDL cholesterol document effectiveness . However , significant subset patient ( 5-18 % ) , tolerate lipid lower statin therapy due intolerable muscle-related symptom characterize muscle pain and/or weakness . These symptom affect quality life lead poor adherence . Patients may seek alternative therapy manage hypercholesterolemia intolerant statin therapy . One commonly used alternative treatment option Chinese herb red yeast rice extract . Several small study perform China , suggest treatment efficacious well tolerate . In U.S. red yeast rice sell counter dietary supplement . The objective study critically examine safety efficacy Chinese herb red yeast rice alternative lipid lower therapy , statin intolerant population . This objective operationalized double-blind randomize trial , compare effect red yeast rice extract , pravastatin level myalgia subject prior history statin-induced myalgia . The specific aim include : 1 . Determine relative rate withdrawal treatment subject receive red yeast rice compare pravastatin . 2 . Determine red yeast rice associate low level muscle pain ( myalgia ) symptom compare pravastatin measure Brief Pain Inventory , validate pain questionnaire . 3 . Determine red yeast rice associate low level muscle weakness compare pravastatin measure dynamometry , validate muscle strength test method .</detailed_description>
