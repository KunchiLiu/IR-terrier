	<brief_title>Improve Nuclear Medicine Heart Imaging , Compare MRI Results With Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , one-third nuclear medicine study perform cardiovascular disorder , mostly myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) use SPECT acquisition . MPI aim detection acute myocardial ischemia scar myocardium increasingly use plan myocardial revascularization ass effectiveness medical surgical intervention . However , nonuniform gamma-ray attenuation thoracic region may severely impair accuracy SPECT cardiac image frequently result image artifact . Therefore , attenuation correct must apply . We derive algorithm ( call EM-IntraSPECT ) able reconstruct tomographic cross-sections patient SPECT study alone . The reconstructed cross-sections turn , may use attenuation correction cardiac SPECT image thus improve quality analysis base image . In research intend continue evaluation new attenuation compensation algorithm assess clinical usefulness method . These goal reach compare patient 's cross sectional anatomical data reconstruct EM-IntraSPECT obtain MRI . It propose 10 patient already undergo nuclear cardiac image clinical purpose , 99mTc sestamibi 99mTc radiolabeled red cell select . These patient would utilized reconstruct transmission image determination internal anatomical structure thoracic region SPECT projection alone . Further , direct quantitative comparison patient 's anatomy obtain MRI SPECT method perform . The algorithm would use reconstruction attenuation compensate emission SPECT cardiac image . Finally , accuracy clinical usefulness new , attenuation correct cardiac SPECT image reconstruction would quantitatively evaluate . All procedure apply image data NOT patient .</detailed_description>
