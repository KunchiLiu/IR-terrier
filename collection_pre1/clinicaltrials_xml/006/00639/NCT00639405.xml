	<brief_title>Evaluation MRI SPECT Fusion Software Localize Parathyroid Adenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While successful neck exploration PHP primarily dependent experience surgeon , currently several localize study available increase success . Although necessity localize study pre-operatively first time neck exploration still debate , question importance persistent recurrent PHP require re-operation . Localizing study patient clearly show reduce operating time , avoid unnecessary dissection , reduce morbidity , improve success rate . Several modality employ localization ultrasound ( US ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The sensitivity ultrasound preoperative detection parathyroid adenoma report 65-90 % ( 1 ) . There however , limitation US . Because sonolucent appearance parathyroid adenoma , impossible distinguish ectopic cervical parathyroid adenoma pathologic lymph node . Furthermore , mediastinal parathyroid adenoma difficult , impossible visualize due acoustic shadow sternum clavicle ( 2 ) . Also , method operator-dependent . MRI slightly high sensitivity 62.5-94 % CT poor sensitivity 40-44 % ( 1 ) . We use dual-phase single photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) image technetium 99m sestamibi visual thyroid subtraction technetium 99m pertechnetate . This method achieve sensitivity 68-95 % specificity 75-100 % ( 1 ) . SPECT image dependent differential washout sestamibi normal thyroid tissue abnormal parathyroid tissue . Theoretically , sestamibi washout normal thyroid tissue much quickly abnormal parathyroid tissue . Therefore , SPECT image usually perform immediately 90 180 minute sestamibi injection . SPECT imaging , however , several limitation , least inability provide discrete anatomic detail . In addition , use control group patient parathyroid adenomas yet surgery test efficacy fusion software . Our goal acquire MRI SPECT image fiducial marker utilize fusion software create detailed anatomic map neck accurate localization lesion .</detailed_description>
