	<brief_summary>Because bilateral low extremity amputee intact limb use mirror , propose conduct pilot trial two treatment phantom limb pain ( PLP ) - direct observation another person 's foot move versus mental visualization . The trial last 4 month first month data gather daily number episode phantom limb pain , average length episode , average intensity pain phantom leg . In addition , rapidity pain relief , length therapy need sustain long-lasting pain relief , whether use two treatment method rehabilitation provide sustain and/or permanent pain relief determine . This study test hypothesis direct observation limb perform phantom limb movement reduce phantom limb pain mental visualization phantom limb alone subject sustain traumatic bilateral lower limb amputation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Efficacy Direct Observation Mental Visualization Foot Movements Treat Bilateral Lower Limb Phantom Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total forty-two ( 42 ) subject bilateral low extremity amputation enrol . Subjects randomized assignment two treatment condition : twenty-one ( 21 ) subject use direct observation another person 's foot movement twenty-one ( 21 ) use mental visualization foot movement ( serve control group ) . Subjects group randomize assignment six treatment group : direct observation mental visualization right low extremity movement alone , direct observation mental visualization leave low extremity movement alone , direct observation mental visualization simultaneous bilateral low extremity movement . Subjects use assign therapy 20 minute daily . The subject study recruit Walter Reed Army Medical Center ( WRAMC ) Amputee clinic . Up sixty ( 50 ) subject recruit screen accord inclusion exclusion criterion since expect may qualify drop-out sooner schedule 4-month completion time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject , 18 70 year age , active duty military , beneficiary , retiree . Written informed consent write authorization use release health research study information . Traumatic bilateral low limb amputation . No prior history vertebral disk disease/condition , sciatica radiculopathy . Normal neurological examination . Minimum 3 phantom limb pain episode week one phantom leg . Degree pain evaluate VAS score minimum 3 cm time screen entry study . Ability follow study instruction likely complete require visit . Age le 18 great 70 . Unilateral upper low limb amputation . Severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) permanent temporary impairment cognitive , physical , psychosocial function associate diminish altered state consciousness indicate neuropsychological screening currently perform routinely patient TBI program WRAMC note patient 's medical record . Subjects diagnosis mild TBI follow TBI test , normal score ( &gt; 42 ) Test Memory Malingering ( TOMM ) ( part 1 2 ) include study . Known uncontrolled systemic disease know cancer remission , know ongoing infection , lupus , kidney disease require dialysis , systemic disease might affect ability participate study conclusion Concurrent participation another investigational drug device study phantom limb pain participation 30 day immediately prior study enrollment . Any condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study . Significant Axis I II diagnosis determine neurologist 6 month prior entry study , define condition require initiation medication hospitalization continue medical treatment condition . Subjects lack effort determine neurologist . Subjects screen effort use TOMM first order exclude blatant exaggeration malingering .</criteria>
