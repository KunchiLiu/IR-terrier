	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate compare clinical performance two toric contact lenses amongst 110 subject , 2-week , single mask ( subject ) , daily wear , randomize , bilateral , crossover study ; 4 week duration . Hypotheses include equal good performance test lens control lenses comfort , vision , toric fit characteristic well corneal integrity</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Toric Contact Lenses Current Toric Wearers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 7 site US participate . Each investigator test control lens type . There maximum 6 schedule visit : Visit 1 : Habitual lens evaluation / Baseline / Trial fit Visit 2 : Dispensing ( combine Visit 1 possible ) , Visit 3 : Questionnaire ( exam ) 7 day ( ±2 ) dispensing , Visit 4 : 2 week follow-up 14 day ( ±3 ) dispensing , dispense second lens type , Visit 5 : Questionnaire ( exam ) 7 day ( ±2 ) 2nd lens dispense , Visit 6 : 2 week follow-up 14 day ( ±3 ) 2nd lens dispense</detailed_description>
