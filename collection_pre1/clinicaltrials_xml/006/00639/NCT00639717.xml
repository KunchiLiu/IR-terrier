	<brief_summary>This research study investigate benefit possible risk add etanercept ( Enbrel ) ECP ( extracorporeal photopheresis ) conventional preventative ( prophylactic ) treatments graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD common , serious , often fatal , complication match unrelated donor stem cell transplantation , regardless pre-transplant condition regimen use ( full reduce intensity ) . Reduced intensity transplant employ low dos chemotherapy condition phase transplant , less toxic full intensity transplant . Reduced intensity transplant may extend unrelated donor transplant option old patient patient exist medical condition illness , full intensity transplant possible . To successful , reduced intensity transplant need offset low effectiveness kill cancer cell condition phase , establishment donor cell , graft-versus-leukemia effect ( GVL ) . The GVL effect GVHD associate therefore , goal GVHD prophylaxis study much prevent GVHD , rather prevent serious fatal acute GVHD . Most GVHD-related death either direct consequence severe GVHD infection associate intense immunosuppression , consequence standard treatment acute GVHD , almost always include high-dose steroid . A effective prophylaxis therapy allow GVL effect develop , limit exposure high-dose steroid may reduce transplant mortality morbidity . We also study key chemical cellular factor relate clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Candidate unrelated donor ( allogeneic ) HSCT hematologic condition , either malignant nonmalignant . Donor unrelated marrow , blood cord blood . Any disease unrelated donor transplant appropriate eligible except : Progressive poorly control malignancy likelihood durable disease control [ i.e. , patient expect least 6 month PFS date transplant ] &lt; 25 % . This determination likelihood durable disease control must take account patient 's disease status consideration agent dos use reduce intensity condition regimen . The determination adequate disease control certify PI designee eligibility checklist . Patients may consent trial base disease control time consent , later remove trial prior initiation transplant condition regimen disease status confirmation consent transplant change . In event occur patient replace . Must receive recognize reduced intensity transplant determine University Michigan Blood Marrow Transplantation Program . Patients age 50 old eligible base age . Patients may &lt; 50 year old eligible reduce intensity condition regimen base disease type ( eg , indolent lymphoma ) comorbidities preclude fullintensity transplant . Patients must adequate venous access either peripheral vein central line ECP perform . Patients must expect tolerate fluid shift associate ECP . The primary reason expect intolerance ECP small size ( ie , &lt; 30kg weight ) , factor may also consider determination . Not candidate reduce intensity transplant condition regimen ( base current UM BMT program clinical guideline ) . Patient suitable related donor available transplant .

Patients active bacterial , fungal viral infection respond treatment . Any medical psychological condition would keep patient comply protocol and/or would markedly increase morbidity mortality procedure . Pregnancy . Tcell deplete allograft</criteria>
