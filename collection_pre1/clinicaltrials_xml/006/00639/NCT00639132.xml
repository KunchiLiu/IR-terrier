	<brief_summary>There longitudinal study track patient ' neurologically developmentally systematic manner . By simultaneously track patient ' neurodevelopment along neuroimaging neurophysiologic study becomes much easy draw conclusion differential effect disease process available treatment patient might receive . In addition , many gene mutation , cause MLD link age onset expect disease course .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Metachromatic Leukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) , autosomal recessively inherit lysosomal storage disorder , cause deficiency arylsulfatase A . This result accumulation sulfate glycolipids ( sulphatide ) within lysosome myelin form cell central peripheral nervous system lesser extent lysosomes cell comprise liver , kidney , gallbladder . The disease characterize progressive demyelination wide variability clinical onset severity . Depending upon age onset disease progression , MLD may classify late infantile ( 6 month 4 year ) , early juvenile ( 4 6 year ) , late juvenile ( 6 16 year ) , adult ( &gt; 16 year ) . In late infantile early juvenile form , blindness , gait disturbance , loss speech , loss hearing , quadriparesis common sign . In old child adult disease may present gait disturbance , mental regression , behavioral abnormality . Disease progression , also variable , result death within year several decade ; however , disease progression among affected sibling seem follow similar course , unlike many leukodystrophies . Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) partially effective treatment report MLD . BMT show halt disease progression asymptomatic patient achieve engraftment prior age symptom occur affected , symptomatic sibling . Despite stabilization clinical course receive BMT symptom , patient ' neurophysiologic test abnormality persist . The clinical implication find research . Patients show mild moderate progression disease prior transplantation continue exhibit disease progression severe impairment . However , specific degree clinical impairment neurodevelopmental function monitor determine level cognitive motor impairment present still allow patient confer benefit treatment . Patients late infantile MLD appear benefit least transplantation process base preliminary unpublished data . Several case report study patient late infantile MLD indicate delayed , continued progression disease despite BMT , others suggest initial deterioration follow stabilization . Transplantation allogenic hematopoietic stem cell show positively influence disease progression lysosomal storage disease Hurler Syndrome Krabbe Disease test enzyme replacement MLD already underway . For future researcher able compare benefit child MLD receive treatment remain untreated , well understanding natural progression late infantile MLD necessary . The current literature contain study individual small group MLD patient track intelligence quotient neurophysiologic function , correlate patient ' neurodevelopment . A longitudinal study large population patient late infantile MLD yet perform . This protocol longitudinal observational study capture natural history data patient late infantile MLD . This data provide baseline neurobehavioral , neuroimaging , neurophysiological information future use evaluate treatment effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient must confirm diagnosis MLD define : ASA activity &lt; 10 nmol/h/mg leukocyte Presence elevate sulfatide urine 2 . The patient must voluntary function ( judged investigator ) , include cognitive motor function 3 standard deviation normal time enrollment . 3 . The patient must age time screen birth &lt; 6 year 4 . The patient must onset symptom age 4 year 5 . The subject his/her guardian ( ) must ability comply clinical protocol 1 . Known multiple sulfatase deficiency 2 . Presence major congenital abnormality 3 . Presence know chromosomal abnormality neurological condition unrelated MLD affect psychomotor development 4 . History hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 5 . Presence know clinically significant cardiovascular , hepatic , pulmonary renal disease medical condition 6 . Any medical condition serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion principal investigator , would preclude participation trial 7 . Use investigational product within 30 day prior study enrollment currently enrol another study involve clinical investigation . 8 . The patient 's parent ( ) and/or legal guardian unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study . 9 . Patient unable comply protocol , i.e . inability return followup evaluation otherwise unlikely complete study determine principal investigator .</criteria>
