	<brief_title>IMC-A12 Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4 month patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) treat anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 . II . To determine best overall response rate patient treat drug . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine median overall survival patient treated drug . II . To evaluate safety , tolerability , adverse event profile drug patient . III . To perform subgroup analysis compare PFS patient advance HCC hepatitis B positive/hepatitis C negative versus patient hepatitis B negative/hepatitis C positive treat drug . IV . To store pre-therapy paraffin embed tumor tissue future tissue-based correlative study . V. To evaluate tumor necrotic area use new volumetric method assess non-viable tumor correlate response . VI . To prospectively validate compare CLIP GDETCH stag system additional prognostic factor . OUTLINE : Patients receive anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 IV 1 hour weekly . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo serum sample collection baseline future tissue-based correlative study . Previously collect paraffin embed tumor tissue sample also store future correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month least 1 year .</detailed_description>
