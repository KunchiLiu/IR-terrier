	<brief_title>Use Levemir® Improves Metabolic Clinical Status Cystic Fibrosis-related Diabetes ( CFRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) relate diabetes ( CFRD ) glucose intolerance affect 50 % -75 % teen adult CF . The 1998 North American CF Foundation CFRD categorize disease differently type diabetes : CFRD fast hyperglycemia ( FH ) , CFRD without FH transient CFRD . The outcome consensus conference use insulin recommend treatment CFRD . Although conference report mandate treatment CFRD FH , treatment mandate type CFRD , choice treat leave clinician 's discretion . However , insulin recommend therapy type CFRD . Although clinician use basal bolus regimens insulin management , many still use NPH . Given need CF patient eat many frequent meal snack maintain weight , use NPH insulin rarely render good glycemic control . A basal bolus regimen much physiologic would allow good glycemic control even frequent meal snack . To date , study document safety efficacy true basal insulin , basal bolus regimen . Furthermore , protein catabolism excessive muscle loss well document CF patient , without , glucose intolerance . Studies group others document major reason catabolism resistance insulin 's anti-catabolic effect protein turnover . Thus , potential clinical benefit improve muscle mass general health insulin treatment even CF patient fast hyperglycemia . A non-peaking basal insulin would reasonable choice , yet study lack . Our overall goal study safety efficacy LevemirTM improvement glycemic control patient CFRD . As second goal , explore ability basal insulin improve protein catabolism muscle mass . The study conduct six month trial .</detailed_description>
