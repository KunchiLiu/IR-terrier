	<detailed_description>There urgent need find safe , effective mean prevent mother-to-child-transmission ( MTCT ) HIV use develop country . One great obstacle prevention area remain HIV transmission breast milk . The primary purpose trial determine nevirapine ( NVP ) plus immunoprophylaxis ( intravenous HIV immune globulin [ HIVIGLOB ] ) extend NVP dose neonate perinatal period safely effectively reduce risk peripartum early breastfeeding-related HIV MTCT . This study last 11-18 week mother 18 month infant . HIV-infected pregnant woman randomly assign one three arm . Participants Arm 1 receive single dose 200 mg NVP orally onset labor . Infants Arm 1 receive single dose 2 mg/kg NVP orally within first week delivery . Arm 2 participant receive single dose 200 mg NVP orally onset labor . Infants Arm 2 receive 2 mg/kg NVP orally within first week delivery 5 mg NVP take orally daily Day 8 Week 6 . Arm 3 participant receive 12 gm intravenous dose HIVIGLOB 36-37 week gestation 200 mg NVP orally onset labor . Infants Arm 3 receive single 1.2 gm intravenous dose HIVIGLOB within 18 hour birth 2 mg/kg NVP orally within first week delivery . There five six study visit pregnant participant . A targeted medical history , physical examination , blood collection occur visit . After birth , 11 study visit infant Arms 1 2 12 study visit infant Arm 3 .
