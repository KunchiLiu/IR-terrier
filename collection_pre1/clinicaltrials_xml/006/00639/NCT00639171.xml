	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) novel image technique noninvasive probe biochemical property tissue . While MRS generate image tumor per se allow biochemical spectroscopic data obtain vivo user define region-of-interest . In manner , biochemical information elucidate MRS interpret relation detailed anatomy image metabolite distribution create . The aim MRS identify presence concentration metabolites characteristic normal abnormal ( tumor ) cellular activity hence allow differential normal tissue pathological tissue , well allow differentiate malignant benign tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Determining Breast Tumor Benign Malignant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent vivo study report successful use 1H 31P MRS differentiate benign malignant tumor breast tissue . These study demonstrate increase choline metabolite peak reflect increase choline-containing metabolite 70-80 % breast carcinoma , compare 14-18 % benign breast tumors.The objective would determine sensitivity/specificity MRS context breast CA , We use normal volunteer test software develop optimize MR scan sequence prior test target subject suspicious breast lesion .</detailed_description>
