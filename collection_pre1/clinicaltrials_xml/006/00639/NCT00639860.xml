	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate clinically , histologically radiographically heal extraction socket cover resorbable collagen membrane ( OSSIX-Plus ) 12 week follow exodontia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation OSSIX-Plus Resorbable Collagen Membranes Alveolar Ridge Preservation Following Exodontia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduction alveolar ridge height width may prohibit optimal implant placement , often compromise esthetic functional result . Alveolar ridge preservation evaluate many study . A variety bone graft material barrier membrane study ability enhance bone formation damage alveolar ridge , evaluate bone heal bone-forming capacity extraction socket . However , newly develop resorbable collagen membrane OSSIX-Plus evaluate purpose . This study design test ability OSSIX-Plus ( OraPharma Inc. , Warminster , Pennsylvania ) promote optimal bone heal follow exodontia . We hypothesize use OSSIX-Plus result preservation height , width density residual alveolar ridge follow tooth extraction .</detailed_description>
