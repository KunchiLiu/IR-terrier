	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving vaccine therapy together radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I/II trial study well vaccine therapy work treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme recover lymphopenia cause temozolomide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate feasibility safety vaccination cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) pp65-lysosomal-associated membrane protein ( LAMP ) mRNA-loaded dendritic cell ( DCs ) recovery therapeutic temozolomide-induced lymphopenia without autologous lymphocyte transfer ( ALT ) patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme seropositive seronegative CMV . Secondary - To assess humoral cellular immune response patient CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA-loaded dendritic cell ( CMV-DC ) vaccine compare impact ALT CMV seropositivity parameter . - To determine vaccination without ALT extend total time progression overall survival patient compare recent historical cohort . - To assess differential ability indium In^111-labeled DCs track inguinal lymph node different skin preparative condition . - To assess differential ability ^111In-labeled DCs track lymph node tumor-bearing non-tumor-bearing side cervical lymph node . - To characterize immunologic cell infiltrate recurrent tumor seek evidence antigen escape recurrent progressive tumor . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo leukapheresis 4 week surgical resection obtain peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) -autologous lymphocyte transfer ( ALT ) CMV-dendritic cell ( DC ) generation . Beginning 2-6 week resection , patient undergo external beam radiotherapy ( RT ) daily , 5 day week , 7 week . Beginning day 1 RT , patient receive oral temozolomide ( TMZ ) daily 49 day . Patients progressive disease RT , dependence steroid physiologic level , intolerance TMZ , failure meet cell release criterion DCs PBLs remove study . Beginning within 2-4 week completion concurrent RT TMZ , patient resume oral TMZ daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 4-6 week 6 courses* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 19-23 course 1 , patient also receive intradermal immunization . Patients stratify CMV serology status ( positive v negative ) randomize 1 2 vaccine treatment arm . NOTE : *Patients may receive additional TMZ treatment discretion patient treat neuro-oncologist . - Arm I ( DC vaccination plus ALT ) : Patients receive CMV-ALT IV 45-90 minute ( course 1 ) 2 x 10^7 CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA-loaded DC ( CMV-DC ) vaccine intradermally administer equal portion inguinal region . Vaccination repeat every 1-3 week 3 dos absence unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( DC vaccination alone ) : Patients receive CMV-DC vaccine arm I . At approximately 2-6 week third vaccination , patient undergo second leukapheresis obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell immunologic monitor additional DCs continue vaccination . Patients may undergo additional leukapheresis achieve positive immunological response therapy require additional DCs generate due prolonged progression-free survival . Leukapheresis may perform monthly , likely perform every 4 month throughout study generate enough DCs continue monthly vaccination . - Additional cohort ( GM-CSF ) : Patients receive CMV-DC vaccine arm II , except also receive GM-CSF vaccine . Vaccines continue total 10 unless tumor progression occur . Patients cohort may enrol point prior completion adjuvant TMZ provide meet eligibility criterion . Prior fourth vaccination , patient arm patient disease progression determine prior first schedule vaccination stratify accord side inguinal injection ( left v right ) vaccination skin site preparation ( unpulsed DCs v tetanus toxoid ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( unpulsed DCs ) : Within 6 24 hour prior vaccination , patient undergo skin site preparation 1 x 10^6 unpulsed DCs vaccination site one inguinal region . Patients receive indium In^111-labeled CMV-DC . - Arm II ( tetanus toxoid ) : Within 6 24 hour prior vaccination , patient undergo vaccination skin site preparation opposite inguinal region tetanus toxoid . Patients receive indium In^111-labeled CMV-DC arm I . At time progression , patient receive final intradermal vaccination comprise ^111In-labeled CMV-DCs base jaw bilaterally inguinal region , control . Gamma camera image take 24 48 hour vaccination compare DC migration groin side neck injection sit observe migration neck injection sit deep superficial cervical lymph node . After completion TMZ therapy , patient continue receive DC vaccination absence disease progression ( except GM-CSF cohort - total 10 vaccination ) . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically immunologic study . Samples examine functional CD4 CD8 immune response patient cytokine fluorescent cytometry ; enumeration pp65 antigen-specific CD8+ T cell tetramer analysis ; antigen-induced T-cell proliferation ; cytokine secretion quantitative anti-pp65 antibody concentration serum ELISA ; CMV pp65 quantitation genomic DNA reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . Patients may also undergo stereotactic biopsy tumor resection confirm tumor progression histologically assess immunologic cell infiltration pp65 antigen escape tumor site immunohistochemistry polymerase chain reaction . Quality life assess self-reported Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain questionnaire initial leukapheresis , first vaccination , third vaccination time post-vaccine leukapheresis , every even-numbered vaccination thereafter . A neuropsychological assessment also conduct prior first vaccine every second vaccination thereafter order monitor change neurocognitive affective change . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
