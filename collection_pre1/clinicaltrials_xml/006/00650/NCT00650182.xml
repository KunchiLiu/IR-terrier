	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety D-TRANS Fentanyl With Naltrexone Adult Patients With Chronic Pain Who Are Opioid Tolerant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , double-dummy safety study adult patient require continuous opioid treatment chronic pain . Patients stable dose duragesic 21 day prior start study treatment period complete screening period least 14 day enter study . Eligible patient randomize ( 2:1 ) receive equivalent strength D-TRANS fentanyl naltrexone HCl ( placebo Duragesic ) dose Duragesic ( placebo D-TRANS fentanyl naltrexone HCl [ D-TRANS fentanyl naltrexone ] ) 15-day treatment period . If necessary , patient could titrate high low dose 15-day treatment period . Each system wear 72 hour replace new system end 15-day treatment period . Patients telephone 3 time day first 3 day study daily remainder study determine sign opiate overdose withdrawal . The patient follow medically indicate base response question . Safety assessment include summarize incidence adverse event ( include topical adverse event ) , vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory evaluation . Blood sample also collect analysis naltrexone fentanyl concentration schedule time study . Efficacy assessment include patient global assessment , investigator global assessment , pain intensity , brief pain inventory . Blood sample also collect analysis naltrexone fentanyl prior dose change patient experience serious adverse event possibly probably related study drug . Duragesic deliver fentanyl dos 25 mcg/h , 50 mcg/h , 75 mcg/h , 100 mcg/h , D-TRANS placebo Days 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 D-TRANS fentanyl naltrexone deliver fentanyl dos 25 mcg/h , 50 mcg/h , 75 mcg/h , 100 mcg/h , placebo .</detailed_description>
