	<brief_summary>Although well document risk acute renal failure iodinate contrast agent , implication intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent nephrotoxicity remain controversial . The aim study evaluate safety profile gadoterate meglumine ( Dotarem® ) patient chronic renal insufficiency evaluate rate patient experience contrast-induced nephrotoxicity follow injection gadoterate meglumine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Safety Evaluation After Dotarem®-Enhanced MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients renal insufficiency require hemodialysis schedule undergo contrast enhance MRI unenhanced MRI examination specify diagnosis , select inclusion . Two group patient define basis plan imaging procedure select obtain diagnosis : undergoing Dotarem®-enhanced MRI undergoing unenhanced MRI . A clinically significant increase serum creatinine level contrast-enhanced MRI exam use indication contrast induced nephrotoxicity . A blood test perform 24h MRI order evaluate baseline creatinine value . 72h exam , second blood test perform . An increase creatinemia 25 % baseline level define contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction . The primary endpoint study assess percentage patient present contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction order show non inferiority enhance compare non-enhanced MRI exam .</detailed_description>
