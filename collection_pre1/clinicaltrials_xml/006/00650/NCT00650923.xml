	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose aflibercept give together radiation therapy temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose recurrent glioblastoma multiforme , gliosarcoma , malignant glioma . Aflibercept may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving aflibercept together radiation therapy temozolomide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) aflibercept ( VEGF Trap ) radiotherapy ( RT ) concurrent temozolomide ( TMZ ) administer patient newly-diagnosed glioblastoma ( GBM ) gliosarcoma . II . To define MTD aflibercept adjuvant TMZ administer 150mg/m2once daily 5 day every 28 day patient stable recurrent malignant glioma ( MG ) RT . III . To define MTD aflibercept adjuvant TMZ administer 100 mg/m2 daily 21 day every 28 day patient stable recurrent MG RT . IV . To characterize safety profile aflibercept combination RT concomitant TMZ patient newly-diagnosed GBM . V. To characterize safety profile aflibercept combination adjuvant TMZ patient stable recurrent MG RT . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To characterize pharmacokinetic profile free bound aflibercept TMZ patient OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study aflibercept . Patients assign 1 3 treatment group accord prior treatment diagnosis . Group 1 ( newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma ) : Patients undergo involved field partial brain radiotherapy ( RT ) daily , 5 day week ( total 30 fraction ) receive concurrent oral temozolomide ( TMZ ) daily 6 week . Beginning 2 week initiation RT patient also receive aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 15 continue end RT . Beginning 4 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive adjuvant oral TMZ daily day 1-5 . Treatment adjuvant TMZ repeat every 28 day 12 course . Group 2 ( stable recurrent malignant glioma ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy group 1 . Patients receive oral TMZ day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12* course . Patients also receive aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 15 begin first day TMZ treatment . [ Note : *The 12 course maximum include adjuvant TMZ course administer prior enrollment . ] Group 3 ( stable recurrent malignant glioma ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy group 1 . Patients receive oral TMZ day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12* course . Patients also receive aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 15 begin first day TMZ treatment . [ Note : *The 12 course maximum include adjuvant TMZ course administer prior enrollment . ] In group , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically analysis pharmacokinetics ELISA . Tumor biomarkers plasma angiogenic peptide analyze correlation response , tumor MGMT promoter methylation status determine use methylation-specific PCR . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
