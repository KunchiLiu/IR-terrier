	<brief_summary>The primary objective evaluate efficacy safety coadministration ezetimibe 10 mg atorvastatin 10 mg untreated subject primary hypercholesterolemia coronary heart disease diet exercise fail . The primary variable LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , secondary variable total cholesterol ( TC ) , HDL-C , triglyceride ( TG ) . The following variable use assess safety compliance drug : vital sign laboratory value . Variables measure first administration drug last administration drug , 6 week treatment . Adverse event also assess .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Criteria Inclusion : Diagnosis : This study design untreated subject primary hypercholesterolemia plasma LDLC concentration &gt; =3.3 mmol/L ( 130 mg/dL ) &lt; =4.6 mmol/L ( 180 mg/dL ) triglyceride concentration &lt; 3.99 mmol/L ( 350 mg/dL ) , coronary heart disease diet exercise fail require drug therapy . Subjects must demonstrate willingness participate study comply procedure sign write informed consent . Subjects must &gt; =18 year &lt; =75 year age . Subjects must LDLC concentration &gt; =3.3 mmol/L ( 130 mg/dL ) &lt; =4.6 mmol/L ( 180 mg/dL ) use Friedewald calculation available time randomization Visit 3 ( Baseline Visit ) . Subjects must triglyceride concentration &lt; 3.99 mmol/L ( 350 mg/dL ) Visit 3 ( Baseline Visit ) . Subjects must document coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . For purpose study , CHD include one follow feature : document stable angina ( evidence ischemia exercise test ) ; history myocardial infarction ; history percutaneous coronary intervention ( primarily PTCA without stent placement ) ; symptomatic peripheral vascular disease ( claudication ) ; document history atherothrombotic cerebrovascular disease ; and/or document history unstable angina nonQ wave myocardial infarction . Subjects must currently take approve statin . Subjects previous history statin use must use statin least 6 month prior Visit 3 ( Baseline Visit ) . Subjects must liver transaminase ( ALT , AST ) &lt; 50 % upper limit normal , active liver disease , CK &lt; 50 % upper limit normal Visit 3 ( Baseline Visit ) . Clinical laboratory test ( CBC , blood chemistry , urinalysis ) must within normal limit clinically acceptable investigator Visit 3 ( Baseline Visit ) . Subjects must fail cholesterollowering diet exercise program least 4 week duration prior Visit 3 ( Baseline Visit ) . Subjects must report stable weight history least 4 week prior entry study Visit 3 ( Baseline visit ) . Women receive hormonal therapy , include hormone replacement , estrogen antagonist/agonist , oral contraceptive , must maintain stable dose regimen least 8 week willing continue regimen duration study . Women childbearing potential ( include woman less 1 year postmenopausal woman become sexually active ) must use acceptable method birth control ( eg , hormonal contraceptive , medically prescribe IUD , condom combination spermicide ) surgically sterilize ( eg , hysterectomy tubal ligation ) . Subjects must free clinically significant disease hyperlipidemia coronary heart disease would interfere study evaluation . Subjects must understand able adhere dose visit schedule , must agree maintain current cholesterollowering diet current exercise program duration study . Subjects whose body mass index &gt; =30 kg/sqm baseline . Subjects know hypersensitivity HMGCoA reductase inhibitor . Subjects consume &gt; 14 alcoholic drink per week . Any condition situation , opinion investigator , might pose risk subject interfere participation study . Women pregnant nursing . Subjects observed designate washout period prohibit medication ( eg , potent inhibitor CYP3A4 , prescription overthecounter agent know low lipid level , corticosteroid ) , stable regimen cardiovascular agent &lt; 6 week .</criteria>
