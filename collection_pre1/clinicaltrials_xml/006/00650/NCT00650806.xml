	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity increase worldwide . Obesity overweight major risk factor chronic cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension stroke , certain type cancer . JNJ-28431754 investigate study possible effectiveness promote weight loss take 12-week period . The study consist 3 phase : pretreatment phase include 7-day screening period 4-week run-in period , 12-week double-blind treatment phase ( neither patient investigator know treatment patient receive ) end-of-treatment visit , posttreatment phase . In pretreatment phase , give write informed consent , patient undergo screen evaluation . Patients successfully complete screen period enter 4-week run-in period give dietary exercise counsel standardized non-drug therapy weight loss . During 12 week treatment , patient continue study diet exercise non-drug therapy visit study site every 3 week weight result safety effectiveness test record , blood sample collect measure concentration JNJ-28431754 blood . In posttreatment phase , patient return study site follow-up visit 14 day receive last dose study drug . Patient safety monitor throughout study use spontaneous adverse event reporting , clinical laboratory test ( hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) ; pregnancy test ; physical examination ; electrocardiogram ; vital sign measurement ; overnight urine collection measure albumin excretion ; assessment calcium phosphate homeostasis ( balance ) , bone formation reabsorption marker , hormone regulate calcium phosphorus homeostasis ; self administer vaginal urine sample collection fungal bacterial culture subject symptoms consistent vulvovaginal candidiasis urinary tract infection . Patients complete 2 questionnaire record reaction take study drug effect body weight daily life . About 100 patient approximately 400 qualify study , consent , take part 2 oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTTs ) . During OGTTs drink glucose solution series blood sample collect measure glucose concentration , collect urine 2 hour period , ( second OGTT ) blood sample collect measure JNJ 28431754 blood concentration . The primary clinical theory study well-tolerated dos , JNJ-28431754 superior placebo measure percent change body weight baseline ( Day 1 double-blind treatment period ) Week 12 .</detailed_description>
