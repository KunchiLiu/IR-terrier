	<brief_summary>This study first large scale randomize study remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) ever perform define role novel therapy clinical tool . This study also first define preoperative gene expression profile associate poor postoperative outcome control ( SHAM ) population child undergo cardiac surgery . Finally , role RIPC modify gene expression profile examine . Therefore , mechanistic insight proven ability RIPC improve marker tissue injury , expect improvement clinically relevant endpoint , examine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) powerful , innate mechanism protection ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury . During course previous investigation , show animal model transient limb ischemia ( stimulus generate remote ischemic preconditioning ) lead induction portfolio myocardial genomic response concerned stress-response repair mechanism , reduces myocardial infarction prolong coronary occlusion , protect cardiopulmonary bypass-induced neural , pulmonary myocardial damage , administer recipient , reduce IR injury transplant heart . In human , show RIPC downregulates gene responsible pro-inflammatory pathway concern TNFÎ±-signaling , apoptosis exocytosis circulate leukocyte , reduce ischemia-induced endothelial dysfunction , decrease marker myocardial lung injury pilot study child undergo open heart surgery . However , latter study power demonstrate difference anatomic age-related subgroup , clinically relevant 'hard ' end-points ventilation time , intensive care , length hospital stay . Thus , propose large-scale clinical study examine genetic predictor clinically relevant postoperative outcome , modify remote preconditioning .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject age birth ( &gt; 36 week gestation ) 17 year . Underlying cardiac anatomy plan primary repair anticipate residual shunting . Repair must necessitate use cardiopulmonary bypass . Informed consent/assent subject , parent ( ) legal guardian appropriate . Current recent ischemic insult , define vascular occlusion episode cardiorespiratory collapse require medical intervention occur within 7 day enrollment . Evidence system organ dysfunction require medical intervention . Current treatment systemic anticoagulation therapy presence bleed diathesis . Presence important pulmonary airway disease require medical intervention . Current previous ( within 10 day screen ) use systemic corticosteroid . Recent ( within 7 day screen ) current document systemic infection sepsis . Anticipated unavailability uninstrumented limb anatomic physiologic abnormality preclude administration RIPC stimulus use standard blood pressure cuff .</criteria>
