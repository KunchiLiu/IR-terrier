	<brief_title>TMC114-C213 : A Phase II Randomized , Controlled , Partially Blinded Trial Investigate Dose-response TMC114/RTV 3-class-experienced HIV-1 Infected Patients , Followed Open-label Period Recommended Dose TMC114/RTV .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial consist two part : partially blind dose-finding part follow open-label part recommend dose TMC114/RTV . The dose-finding part trial consist randomize control ( standard care ) , partially blind , Phase II trial determine antiviral activity , safety tolerability TMC114 , formulate oral tablet , administer low dose ritonavir . The pharmacokinetics TMC114 also assessed.Three hundred HIV-1 infected patient three-class-experienced stable PI-containing regimen screen least 8 week plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1000 copies/mL eligible . Three-class experience define prior treatment ³ 2 NRTIs least 3 month total ³ 1 NNRTI part fail regimen . In addition , patient receive least one PI least 3 month past least 1 primary PI mutation ( accord IAS definition ) screening.As soon result determine eligibility available , later 2 week prior baseline visit , patient randomize one 4 TMC114/RTV treatment group control group ( standard care ) . At baseline , patient change investigator select PI ( ) regimen TMC114/RTV plus optimize background regimen ( OBR ) consist NRTIs without T-20.In dose-finding part trial , primary objective trial evaluate dose-response relationship antiviral activity TMC114 /RTV treatment group 24 week . The recommend dose select base two joint interim analysis trial similar trial ( TMC114-C202 , conduct United States America , Puerto Rico , Argentina ) include approximately 150 patient two dose-finding trial ( TMC114-C202 + TMC114-C213 ) reach Weeks 16 24 drop early . The Week 24 interim analysis include total 497 patient , 329 reach Week 24 discontinue earlier . Based result two joint interim analysis , TMC114/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d . select recommend dose open-label part trial future trial treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patient . The recommend dose TMC114/RTV communicate investigator data cut-off date primary efficacy analysis two dose-finding trial reached.The primary efficacy analysis perform approximately 300 patient trial reach 24 week treatment discontinue earlier ( i.e. , primary endpoint , reach 1 February 2005 ; A total 318 patient include analysis 301 reach Week 24 discontinue early ) . In primary efficacy analysis , TMC114 group compare control group mean confirm virologic response Week 24 , define drop viral load least 1 log10 versus baseline . This primary efficacy analysis confirm TMC114/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d . recommend dose treatment-experienced HIV-1 infect patients.After primary endpoint trial reach ( 1 February 2005 ) , approval relate protocol amendment relevant IEC/IRB authority , patient TMC114/RTV group instruct switch recommend dose TMC114/RTV ( 600/100 mg b.i.d . ) open-label part trial.In addition , long term safety , tolerability durability antiviral activity TMC114/RTV 144 week 3-class-experienced HIV-1 infect patient evaluate . The trial include screening period maximum 6 week , 144-week treatment period follow 4-week follow-up period . The maximum duration trial 154 weeks.Tibotec provide follow-up treatment TMC114/RTV patient continue benefit treatment TMC114/RTV . TMC114 provide drug commercially available development discontinued.The patient remain study he/she longer benefit TMC114/RTV , judge investigator , he/she meet one withdrawal criterion . Dose-finding part trial : 400 mg/100 mg q.d . TMC114/RTV 800 mg/100 mg q.d . TMC114/RTV 400 mg/100 mg b.i.d . TMC114/RTV 600 mg/100 mg b.i.d . TMC114/RTV . Open-label part trial : 600 mg/100 mg b.i.d . TMC114/RTV . Total treatment duration 144 week .</detailed_description>
