	<brief_summary>Objective : The objective study determine whether antioxidant supplement use AREDS shift plasma pool AREDS subject reduce state . The AREDS subject randomly assign one four treatment group : 1. antioxidant ( 500mg Vitamin C , 4000IU Vitamin E , 15mg beta carotene ) 2. zinc ( 80mg zinc oxide , 2mg cupric oxide ) 3. antioxidant plus zinc ; 4. placebo . None subject receive supplemental GSH cyst ( e ) ine . Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause severe visual impairment elderly Americans , estimate 15 million people form disease . AMD primarily affect central vision many patient develop severe visual handicap . Currently clear establish understanding etiology pathogenesis disease .</brief_summary>
