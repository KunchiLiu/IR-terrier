	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) effective radiation free method diagnose Congenital Heart Disease ( CHD ) . MRI work take image anatomy physiology . These image also provide information heart function blood flow . The clarity image enhance use contrast agent ( dye ) . However agent stay blood vessel short time therefore limit time well quality image obtain . This study aim determine whether MRI use Vasovist ( dye stay vessel prolonged period time ) improve diagnosis Congenital Heart Disease ( CHD ) allow area image improved assessment various parameter ( anatomy , volume , flow ) well vastly improve image quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improved Diagnosis Congenital Heart Disease Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Vasovist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan intra-individual study , 20 adult patient CHD ( e.g . Fallot Tetralogy , s/p corrective surgery , single ventricle s/p Fontan operation , aortic pulmonary artery stenosis ) undergo two examination . Both scan aim assess different diagnostic parameter like angiography , cardiac anatomy , ventricular volume flow . The first clinically indicate scan clinically establish image protocol perform use standard contrast agent . The second scan perform use new protocol Vasovist within next seven day . Informed consent additional second scan obtain . In order optimise scan protocol Vasovist plan pilot phase use three patient . Dosage two contrast agent within approve dose . Any adverse event immediately report . The following diagnostic parameter assess compare standard Gadolinium ( Gd ) agent Vasovist . 1 . MR-Angiography ( MRA ) : assessment MRA quality large systemic pulmonary vessel ( arterial venous ) measure Contrast-to-Noise Ratio ( CNR ) vessel sharpness . In addition , overall image-quality score three independent reader ( scale : excellent , good , ok , bad ) . 2 . Cardiac Anatomy : assessment image quality cardiac anatomy 3D single/dual phase MRI measure Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( SNR ) CNR well assess overall image quality three independent reader ( scale : excellent , good , ok , bad ) . 3 . Ventricular Volumes : comparison systolic diastolic volume measure multi-slice 2D short axis cine MRI , two single phase 3D whole heart MRI ( diastole systole ) . 4 . Flow : different flow value measure large vessel use Phase Contrast Angio ( PCA ) data . Furthermore , flow reproducibility determine use two scan . The overall scan-time ass parameter approximately 40 minute . The intra-individual study allow direct comparison different parameter number vascular territory .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The main inclusion criterion patient CHD , i.e . complex congenital defect : 1 . Aortic abnormality 2 . Pulmonary artery abnormalities 3 . Systemic pulmonary venous abnormality 4 . The study limit patient age 18 The study involve MR contrast agent MRI scan , therefore principle exclusion criterion : 1 . Any contraindication MR ( e.g . pacemaker ) 2 . Known allergy MR contrast agent 3 . Patients agree take part study 4 . Pregnancy nursing mother</criteria>
