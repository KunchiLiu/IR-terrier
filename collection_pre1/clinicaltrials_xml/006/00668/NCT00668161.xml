	<brief_summary>There strong observational epidemiologic evidence physical activity inversely associate risk colon cancer occurrence men woman . This association find 30 observational study , appear independent effect diet , body fat mass , potential confounding factor . Prior large-scale recommendation regard exercise mean prevent colon cancer , however , information need regard type exercise , must initiate , much must do , order produce protective effect . Information mechanisms biological pathway exercise might protect colon aid develop answer question . This randomize controlled trial one-year moderate/vigorous exercise intervention vs. delayed- exercise control various biomarkers colon cancer risk person undergo colonoscopy within past 36 months.. The trial design establish effect exercise intervention colorectal cell proliferation terminal differentiation , factor may lie pathway exercise proliferation apoptosis , colon rectal epithelium . It provide data : 1 ) efficacy one-year moderate intensity aerobic exercise program modulating process pattern consider low risk colon cancer , 2 ) mechanism whereby exercise may lower colon cancer risk human . To investigator ' knowledge , first study kind .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim propose study : 1 . To measure effect one-year moderate/vigorous intensity aerobic exercise program vs. delayed-exercise control program person undergo colonoscopy within past 36 month proliferation rate upper part colon rectal mucosa crypt . 2 . To also measure effect one-year moderate/vigorous intensity aerobic exercise program vs. delayed-exercise control program person undergo colonoscopy within past 36 month : - expression apoptosis-related protein ( bax/bcl-2 ratio ) colon rectal mucosal biopsy - rectal mucosal prostaglandin level - fast serum/plasma insulin , glucose , triglyceride , insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) , IGF bind protein-3 ( IGFPB-3 ) - body fat mass distribution ( body mass index , waist hip circumference , bioelectrical impedance , DEXA scan ) - subcutaneous abdominal intra-abdominal fat mass ( measure one-slice CT scan L4 level ) - fitness ( VO2max ) - quality life ( measure standardize self-report instrument ) - sleep quality</detailed_description>
