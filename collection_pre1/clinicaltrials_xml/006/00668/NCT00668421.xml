	<brief_summary>Myelofibrosis gradual replacement bone marrow ( place new blood cell produce ) fibrous tissue reduce body 's ability produce new blood cell result development chronic anemia ( low red blood cell count ) . One main distinction myelofibrosis `` extramedullary hematopoesis '' , migration travel blood-forming cell bone part body , liver spleen , result enlarge spleen liver . Treatment myelofibrosis unsatisfactory medication specifically use treatment myelofibrosis . There protein find present majority myelofibrosis patient ( JAK2 ) drug Lestaurtinib study see stop protein function thereby help control disease . This study divide two Phases ( 1 &amp; 2 ) . In phase 1 look dose study medication ( Lestaurtinib ) high dose patient take without experience serious side effect , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . In phase 2 , MTD dose establish phase 1 , investigate well CEP-701 ( Lestaurtinib ) work suppress protein ( JAK2 ) . The investigator also wish find important biologic characteristic feature myelofibrosis additional correlative biomarker study ( MPD-RC # 107 ) . The correlative biomarker study study relate main study , look answer different question main study . The purpose biomarker study understand cause MPD develop improve method diagnosis treatment disease , main study try find well CEP-701 ( Lestaurtinib ) work treat myeloproliferative disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis primary myelofibrosis , essential thrombocythemia relate myelofibrosis , polycythemia vera relate myelofibrosis require therapy , include : 1. previously treat relapsed refractory 2. newly diagnose , intermediate high risk accord Lille Scoring system ( adverse prognostic factor : Hb &lt; 10 g/dl , WBC &lt; 4 &gt; 30 x 109/L ; risk group : 0 = low , 1 = intermediate , 2 = high ) 3. symptomatic splenomegaly ( must &gt; =10 cm leave costal margin midclavicular line ) . 2 . The subject must consider candidate receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant time enrol study . 3 . The subject detectable JAK2 V617F mutation . 4 . Signed informed consent : Patients must sign consent Lestaurtinib protocol mandatory biomarker MDPRC 107 protocol eligible participate . 5 . Patients must PMFdirected therapy 4 week prior enter study recover toxic effect ( grade 01 ) therapy . Treatment erythropoietin permit . 6 . Serum bilirubin level less equal 2 time upper limit normal range laboratory ( ULN ) . Higher level acceptable attribute treat physician active hemolysis ineffective erythropoiesis due myelofibrosis . 7 . Serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ) level less equal 2 x ULN . 8 . Serum creatinine level less equal 1.5 x ULN . 9 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test prior Lestaurtinib treatment advise avoid become pregnant . Men must advise father child receive treatment Lestaurtinib . Both woman childbearing potential men must practice effective method contraception ( generally accept standard care measure ) . Women child bear potential woman menopausal 12 month undergone previous surgical sterilization . If subject woman childbearing potential , must use medically acceptable form contraception study period 30 day thereafter . If subject man must surgically sterile must use medically approve method contraception duration study 60 day follow last dose CEP701 . 10 . Age &gt; 18 year . 1 . Nursing pregnant female . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 2 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure . 3 . Unstable angina . 4 . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . 5 . Biopsy minor surgical procedure , exclude placement vascular access device bone marrow biopsy , within 7 day prior study enrollment . 6 . Ongoing serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . 7 . Known hypersensitivity component Lestaurtinib . 8 . The subject receive donor stem cell transplant past detectable full partial donor chimerism . 9 . The subject require treatment CYP3A4 inhibitor , include azole antifungal ( topicals permit ) ; protease inhibitor ; nefazodone ; cyclosporine ; erythromycin ; clarithromycin ; troleandomycin .</criteria>
