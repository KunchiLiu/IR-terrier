	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine function enzyme break drug help removal drug body . This enzyme call cytochrome P450 2C19 locate liver . Exposure medication variation gene inherit parent , may speed slow function enzyme . As result , patient may develop unwanted effect drug patient may get benefit take drug . The aim study determine function enzyme liver . We perform series breath test blood sample take pantoprazole . Pantoprazole approve oral intravenous drug Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Screening Phenotype Test To Evaluate CYP 2C19 Enzyme Activity Using Stable Isotope 13CPantoprazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study develop quick reliable method diagnose hepatic CYP2C19 function could use routinely clinical practice . Specifically , propose test pantoprazole - 13C probe determine CYP2C19 phenotype . Pantoprazole , 5- ( difluoromethoxy ) -2- [ [ ( 3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridyl ) -methyl ] sulfinyl ] -1H -benzimidazole , substitute benzimidazole sulfoxide selective long-acting proton pump inhibitor . This drug widely use clinically treatment severe gastroesophageal reflux disease , treatment duodenal gastric ulceration . Pantoprazole extensively metabolize liver , almost 80 % oral intravenous dose excrete metabolite urine . The main metabolite form O-demethylation 4-position pyridine ring CYP2C19 , follow conjugation sulphate ( M2 ) , pantoprazole sulfone form CYP3A represent minor metabolic pathway ( 20 ) . The critical role CYP2C19 vivo clearance drug demonstrate fact healthy volunteer PMs enzyme achieve approximately 6-fold high pantoprazole exposure extensive metabolizers CYP2C19 ( 20 ) . This concept proposal exploit use 13C-label incorporated O-methyl site pantoprazole , specifically design CYP2C19-mediated O-demethylation ( Figure 1 ) . Then , catalysis , CYP2C19-pantoprazole reaction liver result release 13CO2 eliminate body via lung expire breath . The subsequent quantification 13CO2 allows indirect determination hepatic CYP2C19 enzyme thus pharmacokinetics substrate . The salient feature 13C-breath test mean test would non-invasive , non-radioactive , safe simple . The protocol general perform rapidly ( one hour le pantoprazole administration ) determine directly point care ( e.g. , hospital physician ' office ) use relatively inexpensive instrumentation ( UBiT-IR300IR spectrometer ; Meretek ) , patient require wait hour day diagnostic result . This test may particularly important probe activity CYP2C19 infant , child , pregnant lactate woman , senior averse use needle poor health subject scar blood draw .</detailed_description>
