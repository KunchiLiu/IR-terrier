	<brief_summary>This study compare drug call Sutent standard care treatment people advance thyroid cancer . Because advanced thyroid cancer become increasingly common effective treatment option limit , new therapy desperately need . This study design see Sutent follow therapy radioactive iodine target cancer cell delay disease progression well standard therapy alone . Newly diagnose patient , schedule receive radioactive iodine part standard care possible candidate . By enter study , participant agree take oral Sutent approximately one year complete standard therapy . During time , study participant follow closely doctor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sutent Adjunctive Treatment Differentiated Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-stage , phase II historical control , single center , target therapy trial enrol patient stage 2 ( patient younger 45 year age ) , 3 4 differentiate thyroid cancer . The primary objective ass progression free survival population comparison historical control . Sutent give orally 37.5mg daily two ( 2 ) year , 26 cycle . Each treatment cycle consist 28 day . Upon treatment discontinuation , patient follow survival . The frequency type survival follow-up assessment perform discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>
