	<brief_summary>Total joint arthroplasty common operation among elderly population . The postoperative patient ' rehabilitation process may influence variety factor , age , BMI , perioperative hemoglobin level , pain perception , comorbidities , etc . Nevertheless , well control study evaluate effect various factor patient ' rehabilitation short-term outcome . Furthermore , scale develop , predict patient ' rehabilitation functioning level 6 week postoperatively . In current study wish evaluate effect patient ' function follow factor : age , BMI , admission discharge hemoglobin level , pain perception , type operation ( TKA versus THA ) , intensity postoperative physiotherapy , involvement joint primary pathology , comorbidities , self assess health status . In order quantify patient ' level functioning , several test use : hand grip strength , Timed go test ( TUG ) Oxford knee hip score . The factor find statistically significantly associate level functioning , use attempt develop scale predict level function 6 week postoperatively . Such scale allow preoperative identification patient high risk postoperative low functioning level application unique rehabilitation program , patient , order optimize functioning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arthroplasty Rehabilitation Score - Can Predict Short Term Postoperative Outcome ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , analytical , approximately 6 month long study . Population : Approximately 100 patient , schedule elective arthroplasty recruit study : - Males females 18 year age , speak Hebrew , English Russian , schedule elective unilateral ( one joint ) primary total joint arthroplasty hip knee . - Available follow 1.5-2 month surgery . - Willing participate study . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Patient age 18 eligible provide inform consent . 2 . Scheduled elective unilateral ( one joint ) , primary total joint arthroplasty hip knee . 3 . Stepping operated leg allow surgery . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients unwilling participate . 2 . Patients complication prevent regular rehabilitation , e.g . Myocardial Infarction , Pulmonary Embolism , Pneumonia , infection fracture joint . 3 . Patients complication prevents step operated leg . Design : 1 . Prior scheduled operation , follow data regard patient collect : - Gender , age , height , weight . - Comorbidities ( use Katz Score ) . - Type schedule operation . - Involvement primary pathology joint one operate ( patient question ) . - Hemoglobin level admission . - Self assess health status ( patient question ) . - Pain perception operate leg ( use VAS Score ) . In addition , follow test perform : - Evaluation muscle strength use handgrip machine . - Evaluation motor function level use TUG test Oxford knee hip score . 2 . During postoperative hospitalization period , hemoglobin CRP level check , patient evaluate complication . 3 . In follow visit , follow data collect : - Complications discharge hospital . - Blood transfusion period . - Duration time rehabilitation program , intensity physiotherapy give . During visit , follow test perform : - Evaluation muscle strength use handgrip machine . - Evaluation motor function level , similar one performed preoperatively , use TUG test Oxford knee hip score .</detailed_description>
