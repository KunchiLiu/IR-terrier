	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine influence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) -driven immune response acquisition operational tolerance liver transplant recipient follow drug weaning , ass whether immunosuppression withdrawal ameliorate HCV-induced liver damage . Background : Viral infection profoundly influence alloimmune response hamper allograft tolerance induction . Persistent HCV infection occur 50 % liver 20 % kidney transplant recipient , impact HCV acquisition allograft tolerance elucidate . Liver transplantation constitute unique clinical model address question , give 20 % liver recipient completely discontinue immunosuppressive drug attain operational tolerance . Hypothesis/Specific Aims : We hypothesize HCV positive patient fail attain operational tolerance exhibit decrease anti-HCV specific T cell response exacerbate non-specific immunoactivation . Furthermore , anticipate successful immunosuppression withdrawal decrease progression HCV-induced liver damage . Thus aim : 1 . To test whether magnitude HCV-mediated inflammatory response influence acquisition operational tolerance follow liver transplantation . 2 . To establish impact anti-HCV specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell immune responses capacity liver recipient successfully withdraw immunosuppression . 3 . To determine immunophenotypic trait functional property T cell , NK cell antigen present cell affect development operational tolerance HCV-positive liver recipient . 4 . To assess effect immunosuppression wean histological progression HCV-induced liver damage . Proposed method : On basis previously identify immunophenotypic signature tolerance ( high ratio delta 1 delta 2 gammadelta T cell peripheral blood ) , drug weaning offer HCV-positive liver recipient strategy improve HCV-mediated liver disease . We estimate patient select basis biomarker likelihood successful weaning great 50 % . Both peripheral blood liver tissue sample collect diagnostic purpose initiation drug wean order perform follow assay : measurement anti-HCV CD4+ CD8+ T cell immunity , peripheral blood liver tissue gene expression profiling , peripheral blood cell phenotyping functional assay , subset patient , measurement anti-donor T cell response . Immunosuppression drug wean period 6 month , thereafter patient follow 12 additional month . Patients undergo rejection 18 month period consider tolerant . Liver biopsy obtain begin study end . Progression HCV-induced liver diseased compare patient low delta1/delta2 ratio , change immunosuppressive drug conduct liver biopsy obtain yearly ( accord clinical guideline ) . Expected result : We expect precisely define HCV influence acquisition operational tolerance liver transplantation , confirm beneficial effect immunosuppression withdrawal patient .</detailed_description>
