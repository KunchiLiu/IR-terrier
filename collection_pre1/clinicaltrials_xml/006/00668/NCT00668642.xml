	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine drug dutasteride increase expression gene slow growth prostate cancer treatment intermittent androgen ablation therapy ( hormone therapy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Dutasteride Androgen-Response Gene Expression Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We show murine model treatment intermittent androgen ablation therapy prostate cancer dutasteride give regrowth phase ( off-phase ) intermittent therapy , tumor growth inhibit survival improve . We also show testosterone potent inducer certain tumor suppressor androgen response gene dihydrotestosterone . In murine model , show use 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ( dutasteride ) result significant hyperinduction U19 tumor suppressor androgen response gene regrowth phase treatment . In current clinical trial , determine use dutasteride men advanced prostate cancer off-phase intermittent androgen ablation therapy also result hyperinduction tumor suppressor androgen response gene . Gene expression measure tumor tissue obtain prostate biopsy off-phase testosterone level normalize . PSA level also measure determine PSA double time off-phase determine effect dutasteride PSA kinetics .</detailed_description>
