	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab Treat Macular Edema After Panretinal Photocoagulation ( Phase II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levels VEGF elevate eye wth Diabetic Macular Edema expression VEGF find elevate temporarily follow photocoagulation human Retinal Pigment Epithelial ( RPE ) cell . Ranibizumab ( Lucentis TM , Genentech ) anti-VEGF antibody show property prevent macular edema . We hypothesize VEGF inhibition effectively treat PRP-induced macular edema , thereby minimize post-PRP vision loss . Subjects meet eligibility criterion receive 0.5mg ranibizumab administer 7-14 day post-PRP . Additional intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab Day 30 and/or Day 60 may also administer . All subject follow 90 day safety efficacy assessment . There placebo sham arm trial .</detailed_description>
