	<brief_summary>In develop country , poor nutrition , high morbidity , poverty , poor parental education stimulation home , detrimentally affect child 's development . These condition frequently occur together increase risk poor development . Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) affect large number young child associate poor child development . There question whether infant IDA catch mental development non-IDA infant . We plan examine effect psychosocial stimulation IDA child 's growth development use randomize controlled trial compare non-anemic child . The study locate poor village accessible Dhaka . Villages randomize either receive psychosocial stimulation none . Children , age 6-12 month , IDA ( hemoglobin ( Hb ) 80.0-109g/L , ferritin &lt; 12μg/L &amp; Transferrin Recepter ( TfR ) &gt; 7 ) ( n=212 ) without anemia ( Hb &gt; 109g/L , ferritin &gt; 12μg/L , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) &lt; 5 &amp; TfR &lt; 7 ) ( n=212 ) identify village . Intervention include weekly home visit 9 month play leader , demonstrate play home make toy teach mother child development . All IDA child give 30 mg ferrous-sulphate daily 9 month . At begin end study , follow measurement make : Bayley Scales Infant Development ( mental motor index ) , Wolke 's behavior rating , Hb , serum ferritin , CRP , Transferrin receptor , anthropometry , home stimulation , mother ' knowledge practice child development . Stool microscopy , maternal-urinary iodine ( proxy ass child 's iodine status ) , dietary history , child rearing practice ( parent ) mother , perinatal history socioeconomic condition assess begin child 's language development end . Depending availability fund serum TSH also measure child exclude iodine deficiency . We also measure mother ' nutritional mental status ass relationship child 's development . The treatment effect examine intention treat analysis use multiple regression outcome variable control initial measure multilevel analysis conduct control difference village level . The finding project implication international national policy early childhood development program IDA child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Deficiency Anemia Psychosocial Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In develop country , million young child developmental deficit due poor nutrition , lack stimulating environment , poverty . In Bangladesh , poor nutrition , poverty poor parental education highly prevalent , implication serious individual ' future also national development . Iron deficiency child development There increase evidence iron deficiency anemia detrimentally affect child 's development ( Grantham-McGregor Ani 2001 ) . Many cross sectional study show iron deficiency associate poor psychomotor development behavioral deficit young child , poor cognition school achievement school-aged child . Furthermore , longitudinal study observe child anemic first 3 year life continue poor cognition , school achievement psychosocial well child anemic ( Grantham-McGregor Ani 2001 ) . However , anemia associate many adverse social economic family circumstance ( Lozoff et al . 1991 ; de Andraca et al . 1990 ) , may adversely affect child 's development . Anemic child treat iron , fail catch non-anemic child developmental level several study ( e.g . Walter et al . 1989 ; Lozoff et al . 1987 ; Lozoff et al . 1996 ) . A randomized , controlled trial iron treatment conduct anemic young child ( Stoltzfus et al . 2001 ; Idjarinata Pollitt 1993 ; Aukett et al . 1986 ; Friel et al , 2001 ) . In two trial , anemic child four ( Stoltzfus et al . 2001 ) two year ( Idjarinata Pollitt 1993 ) achieve well development iron supplementation . One study Indonesia involve 25 treated anemic child ( Idjarinata Pollitt 1993 ) . The study Zanzibar include many child malaria severely anemic child ( Stoltzfus et al . 2001 ) child Hb &lt; 80g/L show significant benefit motor development improvement language milestone occur child level Hb . Two randomized trial fail show clear benefit ( Aukett et al . 1986 ; Friel et al , 2001 ) . One ( Aukett et al . 1986 ) use insensitive screening test measure developmental outcome ( Friel et al , 2001 ) compare effect low high iron formula development low birth weight child benefit find high iron group . The high iron child actually respiratory infection . A recent meta-analysis randomise trial ( Sachdev et al , 2005 ) find evidence old anemic child benefit iron cognition convince evidence child 27 month . However , three recent randomize trial iron supplementation include ( Black et al , 2004 ; Lind et al , 2004 , Freil et al 2003 ) . One Bangladesh ( Black et al , 2004 ) find non significant benefit motor development iron alone however power study extremely limited group receive iron zinc benefit motor development . Both Indonesian ( Lind et al , 2004 ) Canadian study ( Freil et al 2003 ) find benefit iron treatment infant ' motor development mental development . It suggest poor level mental development find IDA infant may irreversible circumstance ( Lozoff et al 2000 ) . Stimulation child development Iron deficient child show less activity , apathy less likely explore environment iron replete child thus acquire skill slowly ( Grantham-McGregor Ani 2001 ) . One reason failure anemic child catch mental development non-anemic child follow treatment may miss opportunity explore environment . Thus , may require extra play experience catch development . In addition , many anemic child come home low level stimulation psychosocial disadvantage ( Grantham-McGregor Ani 2001 ) , may exacerbate poor level development . In previous study poor population , show teaching mother play child responsive improve child 's development ( WHO 1999 ) . It clear order reach developmental potential , disadvantage child require good health nutrition also supportive caring environment . In Jamaica ( Grantham-McGregor et al . 1991 ) , stunt child need extra stimulation well food supplementation catch non-stunted child . We therefore plan examine benefit add psychosocial stimulation iron treatment IDA infant motor mental development determine catch non-anemic infant . Situation Bangladesh The nutritional status Bangladeshi child extremely poor . Low birth weight estimate occur 36 % birth . It estimate among child 5 year prevalence stunting ( height-for-age &lt; -2 z score ) 43 % wasting ( weight-for-height &lt; -2 z score ) 13 % ( UNICEF 2006 ) . Iron deficiency anemia major public health problem young child . A national rural survey find 52.7 % child age 6 59 month anemic ( Hb &lt; 110g/L ) . However , prevalence anemia 78 % among child 6-11 month age 64 % among child 12- 23 month age ( IPHN/HKI 1999 ) . A review study prevalence anemia Bangladesh ( Ahmed 2000 ) find level range 81 49 % suggestion rural child high level anemia urban child small study . However , severe anemia ( Hb &lt; 70g/L ) rare . The main etiology anemia young child Bangladesh report poor dietary iron intake especially period rapid growth ( Ahmed 2000 ) . Vitamin A deficiency common may contribute anemia ( Ahmed et al . 2001 ) . However , Bangladesh government policy supplement child 5 year vitamin A every 6 month coverage estimate good 87 % ( UNICEF 2006 ) . A national survey 1995-6 ( Jahan Hossain 1998 ) find diet child age one three year mark deficit energy , protein iron . Approximately 60 % iron intake come cereal . It clear poor iron intake major contributor iron deficiency population . Low birth weight also highly prevalent low iron store birth likely another important contributor iron status . A representative survey 14 rural district ( 7,764 people 0-60 year age ) find anemia associate large family , poor sanitation socioeconomic status , poor nutritional status parasitic infection ( Husain et al . 1997 ) . Anemic child therefore likely expose several risk factor associate poverty may detrimentally affect development . Iodine deficiency endemic Bangladesh national Iodine Deficiency Disorder ( IDD ) survey 1993 find 47.1 % population suffer form goiter 69 % people biochemically iodine deficient ( Yusuf et al . 1993 ) . Following survey , salt iodination program start 1993 , improve iodine status people country . In 1998 nationwide survey find 77 % household ( whole country except Cox 's Bazar district ) consume iodized salt ( BBS 1998 ) . According UNICEF 's report 70 % household Bangladesh consume iodize salt ( UNICEF 2006 ) . We therefore assess whether iodine deficiency problem study population , advice family use iodized salt . In addition Bangladeshi mother suffer poor nutrition ( The March Dimes , 2002 ) , anemia ( Stallkamp et al . 2006 ) , low education ( Unicef 2006 ) , also depress ( Hamadani , personal communication ) . Maternal nutritional ( Perez et al . 2005 ) mental status ( Black et al . 2007 ) find affect child 's development .</detailed_description>
