	<brief_title>Cyclic Versus Daily Teriparatide Bone Mass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis serious bone disease become important public health problem . It cause significant loss bone mass increase risk fracture architectural problem skeleton . Until recently , treatment available osteoporosis primarily prevent deterioration bone reduce rate remodel within skeleton . This reduce risk fracture approximately 50 % . Teriparatide new type drug people osteoporosis high risk fracture . Teriparatide stimulate bone remodel correct underlying architectural bone mass abnormality characteristic osteoporosis . This study compare continuous versus cyclic treatment teriparatide combine alendronate , another drug osteoporosis , teriparatide alone woman osteoporosis . All participant complete parent study two year include screen visit physical exam , blood draw , x-rays , EKG , distribution calcium vitamin D supplement . Participants separate two group accord treatment undergone year prior study entry . Participants take alendronate least 1 year prior study entry assign Protocol 1 . Participants previously take alendronate assign Protocol 2 . Participants protocols randomly assign one follow three biopsy group : pre-treatment ; early ; late . Participants pre-treatment biopsy group bone biopsy treatment begin . Those participant early biopsy group biopsy Week 7 treatment , late group biopsy Month 7.5 treatment . Participants also randomly assign one three treatment schedule . Participants Protocol 1 may assign receive alendronate alone 24 month ; teriparatide daily plus alendronate 24 month ; teriparatide daily 3 month time plus alendronate 24 month . Participants Protocol 2 may assign receive supplement give screen visit ; teriparatide daily plus alendronate 24 month ; teriparatide daily 3 month time 24 month . Participants attend assessment visit Weeks 4 7 Months 3 , 5 , 6 , 7.5 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 . Visits may include bone turnover measurement , bone mass scan , walk test , questionnaire , CT scan , blood draw . A recently fund extension study extend treatment period 24 48 month consent . If individual assign teriparatide daily ( without alendronate ) , give alendronate 24 48 month time period . If individual assign cyclic teriparatide , continue cyclic therapy foro 24-48 month period ( without alendronate ) .</detailed_description>
