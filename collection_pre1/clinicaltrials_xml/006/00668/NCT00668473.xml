	<brief_title>Angiogenic/Angiostatic Mediators Patients With Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) connective tissue disease characterize fibrosis skin internal organ . One early pathologic change patient SSc damage blood vessel . Many abnormality find inner layer blood vessel , enothelial tissue . It known mediator blood tissue body affect endothelial tissue . These call angiogenic ( promote blood vessel formation ) angiostatic ( inhibit blood vessel formation ) mediator . Many mediator examine peripheral blood patient SSc , few mediator examine site action , tissue near microvasculature . We hypothesize difference level angiogenic/angiostatic mediator healthy subject subject SSc . In addition , propose difference skin site vary level involvement SSc angiogenic/angiostatic factor subject SSc .</detailed_description>
