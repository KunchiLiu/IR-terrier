But overall use PtDAs across broad US healthcare system remain low . More compelling evidence need make case policy would accelerate adoption PtDAs routine clinical practice primary care setting serve diverse economically disadvantaged population . The investigator believe time move beyond subjective evaluation PtDAs commonly report clinical trial PtDAs , evaluate whether tool also change health behavior improve health outcome . Therefore , investigator build expertise work community-based physician evaluate newly develop PtDA focus diabetes , use mixed-methods approach . The investigator patient sample drawn primary care practice serve African American , Latino Caucasian patient . The investigator conduct 2-group randomized control trial evaluate effect diabetes PtDA , combine telephone coaching , increase patient self-care self-efficacy , increase diabetes knowledge improve clinical measure include glycosylated hemoglobin A1c , lipids blood pressure . The investigator also explore variation effect patient decision aid , compare African American , Latino Caucasian patient conduct in-depth interview randomly select subset trial participant explore patient perception decision aid variation across racial/ethnic group . The investigator hypothesize , compare control condition , participant assign receive video PtDA program telephone coach report : great self-efficacy diabetes knowledge , engagement self-care behavior , good glycemic control measure hemoglobin A1c , well low quantitative LDL blood pressure level . The conceptual model guide investigator trial Integrative Model Behavior Change . The model include three primary determinant behavior : 1. attitude toward perform behavior 2. perceive social norm perform behavior 3. self-efficacy . The investigator expect diabetes PtDA affect construct directly indirectly .</brief_summary>
