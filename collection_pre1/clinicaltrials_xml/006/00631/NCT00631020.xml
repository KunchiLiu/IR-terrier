In keep development field medicine , believe advance smoke cessation move towards goal personalize treatment . Such individualized approach adolescent smoke cessation inform investigation relationship outcomes trial . To serve goal , propose follow program : Youths smoke regularly receive 6 week intervention use `` cognitive-behavioral motivational enhancement '' ( CBME ) supplement nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) , youth parent desire option . Furthermore , youth smoke 5 cigarette day order qualify nicotine replacement therapy . This approach consistent treatment guideline smoke cessation ( Fiore 2000 ) . Compared participant fail achieve smoke cessation , successfully achieve smoke abstinence intervention , low baseline rate comorbid ADHD , lower depressive symptom score , enhance readiness quit , negative attitude towards smoking , few friend smoke , few family member smoke . The investigator predict intervention help youth quit smoking examine prediction successful quitting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tobacco use lead preventable cause death United States , current estimate project 6.4 million nation 's youth die prematurely smoking-related disease ( Fellows et al. , 2002 ) . Extant data suggest three every five adolescent smoker nicotine-dependent , subgroups adolescent high risk dependence ( e.g. , daily heavy smoker , incarcerate youth , youth vocational school , depress youth , youth Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) ) . Adolescent tobacco smoking increase risk wide range negative health consequence ( Abrantes et al. , 2005 ; Anda et al. , 1990 ; Biederman et al. , 2006 ; Escobedo et al. , 1998 ; Kandel et al. , 1986 ; Kollins et al. , 2005 ; Wilens &amp; Dodson 2004 ) . For example , smoking-related cancer risk increase early age initiate smoke long time smoking , underscore importance address health risk behavior youth ( Centers Disease Control Prevention , 1994 ) . Reducing tobacco use adolescent national health priority ( see Healthy People 2010 , Objective , 27.2 ( Office Disease Prevention Health Promotion 2000 ) ) . Approximately 4 % 8th grader , 7.5 % 10th grader , 13.6 % 12th grader smoke daily almost half youth smoke ≥ half pack per day ( Johnston &amp; O'Coner 2005 ) . In recent poll , adolescent smoker report tried unsuccessfully quit ( Grimshaw et al. , 2003 ; Hollis et al. , 2003 ) . Smoking cessation treatment adolescence potential interrupt progression nicotine dependence , attend wide range negative health consequence ( Anda et al. , 1990 ; Escobedo et al. , 1998 ; Kandel &amp; Davies 1986 ) . Given need effective smoking cessation program aim youth , scientifically rigorous research warrant reduce adolescent smoking ( Backinger et al. , 2003 ) . This project address gap scientific treatment literature . In keep development field medicine , believe advance smoke cessation move towards goal personalize treatment . In order optimize aim personalize treatment include genetic testing . For smoke cessation treatment , evidence begin accumulate inter-individual variability response treatment benefit side effect may influence inheritance . In smoke cessation treatment literature , observation already make suggest common gene variant may associate different treatment outcome . The association depression smoking lead interest whether short allele serotonin transporter gene may associate increased vulnerability smoking nicotine dependence , although knowledge yet demonstrate ( Brody , et al . 2005 ) . Such finding suggest individual vulnerability reinforce effect smoke , important study difference quit success , could partially predict individual genotype . Additionally , motivational psychosocial factor also identify likely predictor treatment response . We seek predictor would allow u reach ultimate objective : contribute algorithm good match youth effective smoking cessation treatment . Specific Aims study follow : 1 . To evaluate intervention adolescent smoke cessation . 2 . To examine moderator mediator successful smoke cessation .</detailed_description>
