	<brief_title>XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System India Post-marketing Single-arm Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term surveillance study use drug elute stent ( DES ) may help elucidate mechanism responsible death , myocardial infarction , late stent thrombosis risk observe controlled pre-market trial . This study evaluate XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System ( EECSS ) performance `` real world '' use broad group physician variety health care facility . Consequently , protocol include consecutively enrolled patient India consent participate receive XIENCE V® EECSS , expect represent range clinical use commercialization . Adjunctive anti-platelet therapy critical factor optimize long term DES safety . Despite establish guideline recommend 6-12 month dual antiplatelet therapy , patient DES implant frequently stop take medication early . Consequently , XIENCE V® EECSS India Post-marketing Single-Arm Study ( XIENCE V® India ) follow-up document patient adherence persistence adjunctive antiplatelet drug therapy several time point throughout study . The long term safety efficacy XIENCE V EECSS demonstrate SPIRIT FIRST trial 5 year , SPIRIT II trial 4 year , SPIRIT III Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) 3 year . In addition , pre-approval study show low rate Target Vessel Failure Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) observe plateau gradually decline 1 year consistently low comparator arm study . This benefit MACE sustain 5 year also independent first year result . The post approval XIENCE V India study demonstrate use XIENCE EECSS complex lesion real-world population result 1 year MACE , Stent Thrombosis Target Lesion Revascularization rate comparable previously mention pre-approval study include patient restrict inclusion / exclusion criterion . Therefore , base exist data trial , Abbott Vascular decide discontinue follow XIENCE V India study , 5 year completion three year follow-up .</detailed_description>
