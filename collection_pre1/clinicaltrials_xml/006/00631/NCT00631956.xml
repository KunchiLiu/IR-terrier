	<detailed_description>Blood pressure quantitative trait affect genetic environmental factor . Stanford-Asian Pacific Program Hypertension Insulin Resistance ( SAPPHIRe ) international genetic study , intend map major genetic locus underlie hypertension sibpairs Asian-Pacific Chinese Japanese origin . Success genetic study may depend many factor include selection patient population , identification intermediate phenotype , disease subset , genetic strategy methodology employ . In order reduce heterogeneity genetic environmental background , focus investigation Chinese population . Furthermore , besides variable associate insulin resistance , collect study year 1 5 SAPPHIRe , variables echocardiographic examination multi-detector row compute tomography ( MDCT ) collect study . Hypertension major risk factor stroke , myocardial infraction renal disease . Hypertension often occur combination metabolic complication hyperlipidemia , obesity insulin resistance . The combined disorder often call metabolic syndrome . Our general approach continue analyze candidate gene well perform complete genome search base exit genome-wide scan data together old new phenotype variable . Our objective identify susceptible gene hypertension incorporate intermediate phenotype find gene marker develop useful screening tool high risk group order prevent early detect cardiovascular disorder patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age subject recruit must 35 60 year . Subjects age 60 may also eligible provided documentation hypertension status prior age 60 available . Chinese ancestry , i.e . four grandparent Chinese . Hypertension define follow : systolic BP ( SBP ) great equal ( &gt; = ) 160 mm Hg diastolic BP ( DBP ) &gt; = 95 mm Hg take 2 medication high blood pressure ( Stage II hypertension ) . Alternatively subject could uncontrolled hypertension , i.e . take 1 medication high blood pressure either systolic BP &gt; = 140 diastolic &gt; = 90 mm Hg . One affect sib adopt ( i.e . parent common ) sibs one parent common . Both parent treat hypertension age 60 . If offspring report parent ' hypertension status conflicting , single reliable report hypertension parent age 60 cause exclusion . This exclusion criterion , however , apply discordant sibpairs . Diabetic individual exclude . Diabetes uncover result SAPPHIRe lab work lead exclusion however . Severe kidney disease ( except stone remote infection ) creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl , unless document proof subject meet inclusion criterion prior increase creatinine level . A bodymass index great 35 . In addition , follow condition consider cause exclusion : ongoing ( within past 6 month ) treatment cancer ; terminal illness ( life expectancy few 6 month ) ; liver cirrhosis chronic illness ; pregnancy few 6 month postpartum .</criteria>
