	<brief_summary>The overall purpose trial evaluate efficacy safety deferasirox , dose initially accord transfusional iron intake , patient transfusion dependant anemia relate disorder β-thalassemia sickle cell disease . During study , dose adjust base serum Ferritin.The overall purpose extension allow treatment patient already complete core study , enable collection long term efficacy safety data . Patients continue receive Deferasirox dose receive end core study .</brief_summary>
