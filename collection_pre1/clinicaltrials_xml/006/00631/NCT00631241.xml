	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find parametrial node `` sentinel '' node ( lymph node believe great risk spread cancer ) intraoperative lymphatic mapping identify `` sentinel '' lymph node parametrium ( tissue either side cervix ) . Identifying lymph node may help predict status remain lymph node pelvis . This research also determine India Ink safe use blue dye radioactive tracer improve process identify sentinel node .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lymph node gland play important part body 's defense infection . They also common site cancer spread patient cervical cancer . Intraoperative lymphatic mapping procedure use patient types cancer identify `` sentinel '' lymph node . Researchers know sentinel node contain cancer , remain lymph node almost always cancer-free . Researchers believe parametrial lymph node ( 1 group lymph node locate parametrium ) sentinel lymph node patient cervical cancer . Surgical removal parametrial lymph node currently know way accurately find whether lymph node cancer . Stage IA2 IB1 cervix cancer treat radical hysterectomy ( removal uterus , cervix , parametrium ) radical trachelectomy ( removal cervix parametrium ) . Pelvic lymph node possibly para-aortic lymph node ( near aorta abdomen ) also remove . This procedure call pelvic para-aortic lymphadenectomy . If agree take part study , undergo procedure call intraoperative lymphatic mapping . This procedure do operating room . When asleep ( anesthesia ) , surgeon inject cervix small amount ( le one tenth teaspoon ) radioactive material 4 different place around edge tumor cervix . This injection give 1-2 minute . The cervix inject 2 different blue dye call Isosulfan Blue India ink ( 1 1/2 teaspoon ) . These injection take less 5 minute . The surgeon use special hand-held instrument measure radioactivity help find sentinel lymph node operation begin . During operation , surgeon also visually inspect lymph node see blue ( stained blue dye India Ink ) . These 2 technique ( radioactive material dye ink ) help surgeon identify sentinel node blue color level radioactivity . During hospitalization first clinic visit , doctor tell whether cancer find lymph node remove surgery . You take study intolerable side effect occur . You consider study first doctor 's visit surgery . This investigational study . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
