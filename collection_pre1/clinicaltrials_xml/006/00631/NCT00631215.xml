	<detailed_description>Hyperbaric oxygenation chamber FDA-approved regulate device . Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy ( HBOT ) medical procedure participant inspire enrich oxygen body subject pressure great ambient barometric pressure sea level ( i.e. , great 1 atmosphere absolute , 760 mmHg ) . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy elevate tissue oxygen level , thereby increase rate tissue healing , enhance leukocyte-mediated phagocytosis . It may also elevate growth factor , promotes angiogenesis heal ( Siddiqui , Davidson , &amp; Mustoe , 1997 ) . While HBOT often use wound heal serious infection , utilized treat various disorder , notably cerebral palsy ( Liptak , 2005 ; Marois &amp; Vanasse , 2003 ) condition , include fetal alcohol syndrome ( Stoller , 2005 ) , brain injury ( Rockswold , 1993 ) , stroke ( Helms , 2005 ) ( see Joiner , 2002 review ) . The rationale use HBOT participant neurological developmental disorder relieve hypoxia , often accompany condition . This lead improvement microcirculation relief cerebral edema vasoconstriction , therefore leading decrease symptom characteristic . HBOT implement various dose pressure ( ATA ) practitioner treatment symptom autism , average around 1.3-1.5 atmosphere one hour session , minimum 40 session . The result HBOT presume long-term , systematic examination short-term long-term effect currently warrant .</detailed_description>
