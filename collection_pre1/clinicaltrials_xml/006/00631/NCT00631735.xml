	<detailed_description>The importance touch physiological development , learn pattern , stress reduction demonstrate human animal year research . Based research indicate touch therapy provide significant amount symptom relief reduction anxiety , grow number hospital clinic integrate massage therapy service provide patient order ameliorate many symptom diagnosis and/or treatment-related discomfort . Examples integrative medicine program Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center George Washington University Medical Center include touch therapy modality . Research focus embody experience sensory phenomenon touch important provide basis effective care . No study date focus self-reported experience cancer patient regard touch mean individual , particularly actively treatment intravenous chemotherapy . The embodied sensation touch people important understand order provide effective touch-based intervention also increase awareness direct care staff , include nurse , profound complex effect form touch physically psychically vulnerable . The stress diagnosis treatment heighten patient ' awareness many taken-for-granted aspect daily interaction , include touch touch . The side effect certain chemotherapy treatment create neuropathy make sense touch diminish painful , even extent put sock shoe take pulse blood pressure become excruciatingly painful experience . By allow people actively undergo treatment cancer express mean touch life , fuller understanding multiple dimension experience achieve . Using understanding , effective nursing touch intervention design enhance patient comfort . One author note multitude terminology distinguish type nurse touch literature review . She observe , `` possible touch integral … need serious research recognize … clear research , qualitative research particular , need well understand effect mean touch… '' ( p. 849 ) . Chang ( 2001 ) stress need treat physical touch `` holistic way '' ( p. 821 ) positively impact patient . She also stress mean physical touch `` dependent reciprocal expectation touch , '' ( p.826 ) . Based importance Chang 's delineation multidimensional aspect perception touch mutual nature expectation , additional study warrant elucidate perception touch patient . This understanding use facilitate increase quality life patient cancer good education health care provider integration complementary modality safe , effective plan comprehensive care . The research design phenomenological qualitative design . The purpose phenomenological research description experiential meaning live live . The research question live experience adult oncology patient undergoing chemotherapy touch touch . The researcher conduct minimally-structured interview set follow-up interview verify interpretation ascertain additional participant reflection phenomenon touch . Data consist participant interview record transcribed researcher . Following methodology Colaizzi ( 1978 ) , interview read multiple time immerse researcher participant 's text achieve collective impression feel whole . Following , significant statement select interview pertain phenomenon investigation . Meanings statement formulate hermeneutically ( i.e. , interpret ) researcher . These meaning group accord theme identify researcher . All meaning must consider . An exhaustive description phenomenon investigation write focus universal , essence lie side concreteness live meaning . The researcher return participant validation meaning , cluster , description . Finally , new data obtain participant incorporated structure research . Prior conduct interview throughout entire research process , log keep researcher 's presupposition investigate topic . This acknowledgement researcher 's viewpoint assist set pre-conceived idea aside order come direct term meaning live participant . One author 's contribution methodology come approach interpretation text . He describe follow component phenomenological interpretation : 1. turn nature live experience , 2. investigate live experience , 3. hermeneutical phenomenological reflection , 4. hermeneutical phenomenological writing , 5. maintaining strong orient relation , 6. balance research context consider part whole . These interpretive relationship linear step ; form guideline phenomenological reflection write . While concept reliability validity apply phenomenological research quantitative study , data trail decision regard interpretation document fully think process identification essential theme meaning audit outside reviewer . Trustworthiness data interpretation paramount qualitative inquiry . Lincoln Guba ( 1985 ) set forth four basic concept establish trustworthiness : truth value , applicability , consistency , neutrality . They discuss divergence naturalistic paradigm qualitative research method traditional positivist paradigm cause effect . The four concept take follow respective characteristic : credibility , transferability ( require contextual similarity ) , dependability , confirmability . The first step study researcher 's articulation presupposition regard phenomenon touch . This carry throughout process study ensure process interpret define essence participant ' experience unduly influence experience researcher . Following approval Institutional Review Board , participant recruit physician , nurse practitioner , physician assistant recommendation Regional Oncology Center central New York oncology clinic . Each patient ask practitioner wish take part study . If person interested , phone number forward researcher practitioner . The researcher contact patient confirm willingness participate understanding aim procedure study . For patient confirm desire participation , researcher obtain informed write consent . Participants may withdraw time study interview transcribe , order maintain integrity study . All potential physical , social , legal , risk describe phone number give participant contact researcher case question . Each participant interview approximately one hour private place time convenient participant researcher . Before begin interview , participant ask choose pseudonym . A second interview take place several month later ( researcher sufficient time fully immerse data ) . This give participant chance reflect interview review interpretation information make researcher . Each interview tap field note take researcher . These transcribed soon interview allow initial impression note along interview text . Subjects enrol saturation reach ( new data obtain initial interview ) . Due need saturation , number interview plan beforehand ; however , number estimate 8 12 participant . The interview transcribe researcher transcriptionist . To protect confidentiality , participant ' name attach electronic paper data ; pseudonym use interview data identifier . All data store lock file container accessible researcher . All audiotape destroy completion research study . The confidentiality agreement keep securely separate , lock file cabinet also accessible researcher . Participants ' demographic information , include age , gender , ethnicity , educational level , employment ( current illness ) collect stored pseudonym . Interviews consist broad open-ended question . In order establish rapport provide foundation detailed question , initial question begin experience discover cancer , diagnosis , experience treatment , social personal consequence live experience . Exploration initial diagnosis important life-changing nature diagnosis accompany feel shock many people experience moment receiving diagnosis ( American Cancer Society , 2006 ) . The questioning focus experience touch others , first process diagnosis treatment , prior experience . Questions also formulate interview sensation touch prior treatment , include touch others . All question broad allow great possible latitude participant interpretation ; however , general list question formulate ensure consistency completeness data collection across participant . In general , interview paramount data collection intention researcher `` minimally intrusive '' elicit description robust complete describe person 's perspective phenomenon . In study , several broad question ask point interview ensure similar baseline data collect participant . Questions ask : - Please tell change experience since diagnosed cancer . - Please tell coped diagnosis treatment . - How people around react diagnosis ? - How important touch ? - Has sense touch change way since start chemotherapy ? - Has amount physical contact others change ? - Have ever massage form touch therapy ? - Please describe feel touch go medical clinic procedure CT scan do .</detailed_description>
