	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate , Hormone Ablation Radiation Therapy Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Sunitinib malate design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel essential growth cancer . Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone ( LHRH ) Analogues like Lupron速 ( leuprolide ) Zoladex速 ( goserelin ) hormonal treatment use help stop body make testosterone ( male sex hormone ) body . Prostate cancer cell need testosterone survive . Anti-Androgen drug , like Casodex速 ( bicalutamide ) also stop cell growth block male hormone like testosterone . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , assign study group . The group assign dose sunitinib malate receive depend join study . Three ( 3 ) dose level sunitinib malate test . The first group participant receive low dose sunitinib malate . The next group enrol receive high dose sunitinib malate , intolerable side effect see . Before begin take sunitinib , begin receive hormone therapy . You receive leuprolide goserelin . Leuprolide give needle muscle , goserelin give needle skin abdomen . You receive 1 injection every 3 month . Which hormonal drug give ( leuprolide goserelin ) assign doctor and/or depend insurance coverage . You may also receive bicalutamide . This leave doctor . You take bicalutamide mouth day 2 week ( without food ) . After least 4 week hormone therapy give , begin take sunitinib malate combination hormone therapy . You take sunitinib malate day ( either without food ) 16 week row . Radiation Therapy : After 4 week combine treatment sunitinib hormone therapy , begin radiation treatment . Radiation treatment give day , 5 day week , 8 week . Each treatment take 20-30 minute . This procedure discuss detail . You continue take sunitinib hormone therapy radiation treatment . Study Visits : On day start treatment sunitinib , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight . - You ask side effect may since last visit . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . About Day 15 treatment sunitinib , day begin radiation therapy ( first treatment ) , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight . - You ask side effect may since last visit . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 2 week radiation therapy , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight ( every 2 week ) - You blood draw ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test . - You ask side effect may since last visit . About 4 week stop radiation therapy , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . The blood test include measurement prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) testosterone level . - You ask side effect since last visit . Length Study : You continue take sunitinib malate study total 16 week . Radiation treatment last 8 week . Hormone injection continue period 2 year . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease get bad . Long-Term Follow-up : You follow every 6 month via telephone call and/or review medical record . If contact , ask side effect , therapy may since stop treatment study . You follow 10 year take sunitinib malate 20 week . This investigational study . Sunitinib malate FDA approve commercially available treatment adult kidney cancer . Bicalutamide , leuprolide , goserelin FDA approve commercially available use prostate cancer . Up 22 patient enrol multicenter trial . Up 12 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Prior VEGFR/PDGFR inhibitor investigational therapy . 2 . Inability take oral medication 3 . Chronically uncontrolled hypertension , define conventionally consistent/repeated systolic pressure 140 mmHg diastolic pressure 90 mmHg despite antihypertensive therapy . This may establish home BP reading . There criterion relate specific BP result require eligibility , acute BP elevation related iatrogenic cause , acute pain , transient reversible cause consider exclusion criterion . The intent exclude patient chronically uncontrolled hypertension might exacerbate Sunitinib . 4 .
