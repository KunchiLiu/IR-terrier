	<brief_summary>Failure wean mechanical ventilation ( failure get patient breathe machine ) associate prolonged stay intensive care unit increase risk death . Some patient difficulty successfully get ventilator breathe . Usually difficulty due lung problem . But sometimes due heart problem , heart failure . To improve patient 's chance successfully get ventilator early , helpful doctor know patient heart failure measure severe . With new monitoring system study , doctor may able detect measure heart failure easily . A new monitor ( Vigileo TM ) connect specific cable ( Flo-TracTM ) catheter inside patient 's artery ( arterial line ) lately develop . This monitor estimate amount blood heart pump per minute , know cardiac output . The heart suppose pump blood harder patient wean breathing machine . With mentioned monitor , hope detect patient whose heart weak pump hard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Hemodynamic Changes During Weaning From Mechanical Ventilation With Flo-Trac Vigileo ( TM ) Monitor .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In process liberation discontinuation mechanical ventilation ( also commonly refer `` wean '' ) goal achieve spontaneous breathe ultimately extubation . Weaning failure occur 25 % patient meet criterion wean , especially underlie COPD heart failure ( 1 ) . Weaning failure well know prolong intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay , increase morbidity mortality critically ill patient . Early identification treatment cause weaning failure paramount importance improve outcome difficult wean patient . Although respiratory system failure common cause weaning failure , occult cardiovascular insufficiency occur often critically ill patient , contribute , cause wean failure many patient ( 2 ) . Recognition cardiovascular origin wean failure crucial since use vasodilator and/or diuretic may result successful weaning ( 1 ) . Cardiovascular instability liberation mechanical ventilation first describe 30 year ago Beach et al ( 3 ) post-operative cardiac surgery patient . Since , study describe hemodynamic change patient underwent successful unsuccessful wean form mechanical ventilation ( 1,4,5,6,7 ) . Lemaire et al . ( 4 ) emphasize use pulmonary artery catheter `` gold standard '' detect leave ventricular dysfunction spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) . They report markedly increased pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ( PAOP ) patient suffer COPD heart failure fail wean mechanical wentilation . Jubran et al . ( 5 ) report increase PAOP , decrease mixed venous oxygen saturation ( SvO2 ) increase oxygen extraction ratio group patient fail wean mechanical ventilation . In contrast , De Backer et al . ( 6 ) describe increase cardiac index group patient successfully wean cardiac surgery . A recently publish study Frazier et al . ( 7 ) corroborate previous data compare hemodynamic change group patient successfully wean group patient fail wean mechanical ventilation . The cardiac output stroke volume estimate differential Fick partial rebreathing technique , carbon dioxide indicator substance . The group patient successfully wean statistical significant increase stroke volume cardiac index , unlike group fail weaning . The physiologic change explain mentioned finding hemodynamic parameter wean complex fully understood ( 1 ) . It well known wean place excessive burden heart consider form `` exercise '' ( 2 ) . As studied exercise physiologist , increase oxygen consumption exercise healthy individual match increase cardiac output oxygen extraction . In patient overt heart failure , increase cardiac output inadequate , predominant response constitute increase oxygen extraction . Return spontaneous breathe induces alteration intrathoracic pressure influence cardiovascular function , produce , among change , increase venous return . Other postulate physiologic change include increase sympathetic tone , weaning-induced myocardial ischemia increase ventricular interdependence ( 2 ) . The recognition cardiac origin wean failure vital importance . Unfortunately , clinical sign patient fail wean acute heart failure ( tachypnea , tachycardia , anxiety , etc ) often difficult distinguish sign respiratory failure . Reliable bedside minimally invasive monitoring tool test need develop help clinician identifying patient help titrate cardiovascular therapy wean trial . Currently , list tool short validity technique different situation unknown ( 2 ) . Cardiovascular dysfunction may miss piece predict wean success . Cardiovascular monitoring useful identify manage patient fail wean due lack cardiac reserve . We propose use Flo-Trac/VigileoTM , semi-invasive technique estimate cardiac output arterial pressure waveform , tool cardiac monitoring process wean mechanical ventilation . References : 1 .
