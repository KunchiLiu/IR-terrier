	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) good way treat tumor near spinal cord . Patients either receive single treatment 25 day treatment give once-a-day , Monday Friday 5 continuous week . Our protocol use life expectancy , patient preference , tumor size determine whether SBRT deliver 1 25 treatment . The single treatment dose 15 Gy . The 25 treatment group 70 Gy 2.8 Gy/treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol study use Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) type primary metastatic tumor near spinal cord . The major goal study evaluate efficacy toxicity specific SBRT program prospective manner . The main outcome variable study pain neurologic function . A major issue deliver SBRT number treatment session . There advantage disadvantage single multi treatment program . In protocol , patient offer SBRT either single treatment 25 treatment day . This study design compare different SBRT schedule . A single treatment program convenient likely relieve symptom sooner multi-session program . A program 25 treatment may produce good long-term result . Our protocol use life expectancy , patient preference , tumor size determine whether SBRT deliver 1 25 treatment .</detailed_description>
