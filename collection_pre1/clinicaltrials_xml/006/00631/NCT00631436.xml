	<brief_summary>Brain injury explosive blast prominent feature contemporary combat . Although protective armor effective acute medical intervention allow soldier survive blast event , grow number veteran disability stem blast-related neural damage . Soldiers also return combat psychological disability cause traumatic war event . The clinical presentation individual blast-related neural damage post-traumatic psychopathology markedly similar thus clear description direct consequence explosive blast complicate emotional cognitive sequela psychological trauma . We use sophisticated measure neural function structure characterize brain injury explosive blast sample Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) National Guard soldier return deployment fall 2007 . Survey data gather near end deployment indicate 50 % brigade expose direct physical effect explosive blast . To fully characterize effect blast brain differentiate post-traumatic stress disorder , contrast group soldier expose blast group experience post-traumatic stress disorder . This investigation improve characterization blast-related traumatic brain injury , describe essential feature condition term neural function structure inform diagnosis , characterize mechanisms recovery blast-related neural injury allow creation intervention return soldier maximum level function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The clinical presentation individual blast-related brain injury post-traumatic stress reaction markedly similar thus clear description direct consequence explosive blast complicate emotional cognitive sequela psychological trauma . The inability clearly separate basis symptom two condition hamper clinician prescribe effective treatment return soldier maximal functioning . Measures directly assess neural disruption may employ differentiate blast-related brain injury post-traumatic psychopathology guide effective intervention.. Objective/Hypothesis : We propose use quantitative index brain electrical activity diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) characterize effect blast injury brain function structure . We hypothesize Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) soldier injured explosive blast distinguishable post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) measure brain function structure . Specifically , blast exposure associate diminished P3a amplitude target stimulus sustain attention diminish lateralized frontal potential recognition previously present word . Individuals PTSD exhibit normal amplitude P3 lateralize frontal brain potential . Blast affect soldier also compromise white matter integrity supracallosal , inferior frontal , superior frontal brain region PTSD associate structural abnormality . Finally , functional brain anomaly ( e.g. , P3a ) , frontal white matter fractional anisotropy associate adaptive functioning soldier . Specific Aims : Using advance quantitative analysis electroencephalogram recording determine nature functional neural anomaly relate sustained attention memory deficit evident injury blast . We determine white matter anomaly unique blast injury compare PTSD . We also determine aspect blast-related functional structural brain abnormality associate adaptive functioning post-deployment . The long-term goal propose program research improve characterization traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) due blast , describe essential feature term neural function structure improve diagnosis , characterize mechanisms recovery blast-related neural injury facilitate creation intervention target pathophysiology . Study Design : In May 2007 2650 Minnesota National Guard troop 1/34 BCT complete within-theatre survey health , exposure blast , traumatic event . Fifty-one percent survey troops report close enough explosive blast felt heat pressure wave , trouble hearing , subsequent problem attention memory . The propose study carry four-year period include total 180 subject . To determine neural consequence blast exposure compare functional structural brain characteristic individual 1/34 BCT blast injury , blast injury PTSD , PTSD , blast injury PTSD . There 45 demographically similar subject group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A high level posttraumatic stress operationally define `` moderate '' level ( rating 3 1 5 scale ) follow symptom accord Hoge et al 4 : one reexperiencing symptom , three avoidance symptom , two hyperarousal symptom . Staff complete screening interview via telephone potential participant answer question Blast Exposure Screen . The Blast Exposure Screen provide comprehensive assessment exposure blast duration deployment . Blast event rat physical effect ( e.g. , knock balance , physically thrown blast ) effect ( i.e. , memory problem , headache ) individual . Individuals report memory lapse , Sensitivity light noise , headache Difficulty concentration shortly explosive blast symptom past month invite participate study . Participants exclude study manifest Current substance induce psychotic disorder psychotic disorder due general medical condition TBI Current past DSM IV define substance dependence alcohol , caffeine , nicotine Current DSM IV substance abuse alcohol , caffeine , nicotine A neurologic condition DSM Axis I mental disorder prior deployment ( predeployment data sample soldier 1/34 BCT yield estimate rate 5 % either PTSD depression ) Current predeployment unstable medical condition would likely affect brain function ( e.g. , clear anoxic episode , cardiac arrest , current uncontrolled diabetes ) Significant risk suicidal homicidal behavior Head injury source blast result loss consciousness 15 minute , posttraumatic amnesia , skull fracture , hospitalization . The screen interview include question assess subject respect exclusion criterion . During telephone contact subject complete screen MRI protocol order exclude individual may metal fragment body .</criteria>
