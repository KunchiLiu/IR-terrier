	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether investigational drug call sunitinib malate safe effective treat metastatic melanoma patient KIT mutation . KIT gene `` code '' ( contain genetic code body us make ) protein surface cell body important cell growth cell division . The KIT protein seem play role abnormal cell growth see acute leukemia , germ cell tumor , gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , certain melanoma . Melanomas arise acral skin ( palm , sol , nail bed ) , mucosal membrane , chronically sun damage skin recently find frequently contain mutation increase copy number KIT gene . Your tumor tissue previously test find contain abnormality KIT gene . Sunitinib malate drug show inhibit activity KIT protein . The FDA approve sunitinib 2006 patient GIST . It show sunitinib malate work patient activity KIT protein . The FDA also approve Sunitinib malate 2006 treatment metastatic kidney cancer , effectiveness probably due ability block different set protein . Sunitinib malate approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm advanced stage III IV melanoma primary origin mucosal , acrallentiginous , chronic sundamaged skin . Advanced disease define locally recurrent disease metastatic disease amenable surgical therapy . Patients may enter tumortesting phase even recurrent disease . Aberration KIT gene KIT receptor invitro test tumor tissue . Evidence measurable disease RECIST criterion [ Appendix 2 ] . Bone lesion , ascites , peritoneal carcinomatosis miliary lesion , pleural pericardial effusion , lymphangitis skin lung , cystic lesion , irradiate lesion consider measurable . Resolution acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy surgical procedure NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade â‰¤1 . Adequate organ function ECOG performance status 0 1 . Major surgery radiation therapy within 2 week start study treatment . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion irradiate . NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 week start study treatment . Diagnosis second malignancy within last 2 year , except adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell skin cancer , localize prostate cancer , situ cervical cancer . Active brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , evidence symptomatic brain leptomeningeal carcinomatosis screen CT MRI scan . Patients central nervous system metastasis treat surgery radiation therapy CNS metastases consider control eligible , provide measurable disease outside CNS present . Any follow within 2 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade &gt; 2 . Prolonged QTc interval baseline EKG ( &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female ) Uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt; 160/100 mm hg despite optimal medical therapy ) . Concurrent treatment another clinical trial . Supportive care trial nontreatment trial , e.g. , QOL , allow . Ongoing treatment therapeutic dos warfarin ( low dose warfarin 2 mg po daily thromboprophylaxis allow ) . Pregnant breastfeeding . Life expectancy le 3 month .</criteria>
