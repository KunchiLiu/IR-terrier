	<brief_summary>Cysteinyl leukotrienes ( CysLTs ) play important role asthma . CysLTs exert bronchoconstrictive pro-inflammatory effect activation CysLT1-r. As allergic rhinitis appear predispose factor development asthma CysLT-receptors seem implicate first step asthma manifestation , think would interest determine CysLT1-r key mediator progression allergic rhinitis asthma . We believe would interest study expression CysLT1-r Our goal ass baseline , well variation follow allergen bronchoprovocations , expression CysLT1-r mild asthmatic subject compare non asthmatic subject allergic rhinitis . Our hypothesis high baseline expression CysLT1-r asthmatic subject compare allergic rhinitis subject allergen bronchoprovocations induce increase expression CysLT1-r group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CysLT1-r Expression Following Allergen Exposure Asthma Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recruit mild allergic asthmatic subject non asthmatic subject allergic rhinitis . On baseline visit , allergy skin prick test , spirometry , methacholine bronchoprovocation induce sputum ( IS ) differential leukocyte count obtain . In second step , mild asthmatic subject undergo conventional bronchial allergen challenge . IS obtained 6h ( correspond late asthmatic response ) 24h follow challenge . The rhinitic subject asthmatic subject undergo 4-day low dose allergen bronchial challenge well nasal allergen challenge . Sputum sample obtain follow day 2 4 low dose challenge one week later , 24h follow nasal challenge . Induced sputum analyze differential cell count . Total mRNA extract IS cell use RT-PCR .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To positive reaction one allergen prick test . Non smokers No respiratory track infection least one month prior study . Asthmatic subject use inhaled beta2 agonist need basis asthma treatment . Asthmatic subject history asthma least 6 month . Asthmatic subject PC20 methacholine low equal 8 mg/ml . Allergic rhinitic subject never experience asthma symptom take asthma medication past . Allergic rhinitic subject PC20 methacholine high 16 mg/ml . Smokers ex smoker less 6 month 10 packyears . Asthmatic subject use use past 3 month inhale oral corticosteroid .</criteria>
