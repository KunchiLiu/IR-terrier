	<detailed_description>A sufficient number Asian subject ( expect approximately 90 ) type 2 diabetes BMI 18 25-40 kg/m2 meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enter study randomize approximately 60 subject . The eligible obese subject type 2 diabetes enter 2-week lead-in period EDP individual diet/lifestyle consultation implement nutrition therapy exist diabetes management . The diet recommendation EDP lead-in period base nutrition recommendation ADA include carbohydrate monounsaturated fat together provide 60-70 % energy intake , reduce intake saturate fat ( &lt; 10 % total calorie ) cholesterol ( &lt; 300 mg/day ) protein intake around 15-20 % total daily energy . Approximately 60 participant randomize Week 0 ( Visit 3 ) 1:1 ratio receive either ( 1 ) meal replacement program Glucerna SR top EDP ( 2 ) caloric-matched EDP . The participant receive educational program diet , exercise , behavioral strategy randomization . Each randomize subject meal replacement group receive Glucerna SR replace one meal ( breakfast ) one pre-sleep snack 24 week . The subject group EDP receive meal plan like lead-in period . All study subject place diet plan 500 ~ 800 kcal/day le estimated daily maintenance energy requirement receive individualize exercise prescription facilitate optimal diabetes management . The participant visit clinic 4-week interval 24 week randomization evaluate efficacy safety parameter . The participant receive two different meal test baseline end study . The macronutrient composition meal test protocol 1 480 Kcal Glucerna SR breakfast 50 % CHO , 20 % protein , 30 % fat . The test meal protocol 2 480 Kcal sandwich breakfast 63 % CHO , 20 % protein , 17 % fat . The primary efficacy variable change baseline incremental area curve ( âˆ†AUC ) glucose response Glucerna-SR test meal two group . A telephone follow-up perform 2 week study evaluate condition relate study .</detailed_description>
