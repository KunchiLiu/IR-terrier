	<detailed_description>Background : Appropriate airway management critical point pediatric resuscitation pediatric critical care . It remain , however , challenge pediatric resident learn retain critical skill . Recent report PICU show pediatric resident participate 28 % initial orotracheal intubation , rate first successful endotracheal tube placement 38 % orotracheal intubation attempt . Repetitive poor-skilled intubation attempt may associate complication dental laryngeal contusion , prolong intubation attempt may associate hypoxia hemodynamic instability . In order improve operational performance efficacy ( first attempt success rate ) safety ( minimize associate event could potentially lead adverse event ) , good train method warrant . Objectives : To test hypothesis just-in-time training pediatric airway management may improve patient safety operational performance orotracheal intubation decrease intubation associate event pediatric resident PICU . To test hypothesis high fidelity simulation may enhance train efficacy patient safety simulation setting . Study Design : This prospective interventional study . During eighteen month study period , one two on-call pediatric resident 7 south PICU ( 24 bed ) receive 20 minute just-in-time pediatric airway management training . This training occur shift start morning round . This training cover direct laryngoscopy technique , orotracheal intubation technique , confirmation tube placement recognition associate event . This training do without high fidelity simulation function . We use SimBaby ( Laerdal , Norway ) . The assignment randomize . The clinical data orotracheal intubation collect NEAR-4 KIDS registry . Primary outcome change first attempt success rate resident overtrained group ( 7 South PICU ) compare standard training group ( 7 East PICU ) . The secondary outcome rate resident participation orotracheal intubation attempt , number intubation attempt successful intubation resident number intubation associate event . The videotaped performance training analyze Healthcare Failure Mode Effect Analysis ( HFMEA ) compare high fidelity simulation train group low fidelity simulation train group . The evaluation system develop HFMEA validate performance experience non-experienced intubators . Furthermore , real orotracheal intubation team performance PICUs evaluate scale research assistant . The demographic training data participant real PICU intubation collect . No patient identifiable information collect . This data also keep password-protected research computer .</detailed_description>
