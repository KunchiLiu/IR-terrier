	<brief_title>Primary Tube Versus Trabeculectomy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma surgery indicate intraocular pressure ( IOP ) lower need despite use maximum tolerate medical therapy appropriate laser treatment . Trabeculectomy ( guard filtration procedure ) frequently perform glaucoma opertion . Eyes previous ocular surgery certain secondary glaucoma ( e.g . neovascular glaucoma uveitic glaucoma ) great risk trabeculectomy failure . Wound heal modulation antifibrotic agent , like mitomycin C ( MMC ) 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , show increase success glaucoma filter surgery high risk eye . The use MMC 5-FU become widespread clinical practice . The improved efficacy trabeculectomy adjunctive antifibrotic agent high risk eye prompt use eye consider low risk failure . A randomized clinical trial find similar IOP reduction surgical complication intraoperative application MMC 5-FU eye undergo primary trabeculectomy . Although antifibrotic agent increase likelihood IOP control follow glaucoma filter surgery , also increase risk complication . The prevalence bleb-related infection , bleb leak , bleb dysesthesia associate perilimbal filtering bleb suggest need consider alternative surgical approach . Favorable result report tube shunt ( glaucoma drainage implant ) , device grow popularity . In particular , large surface area Baerveldt glaucoma implant combine ease insertion single quadrant offer advantage tube shunt . Similar surgical result report tube shunt trabeculectomy MMC 5-FU study separately similar patient group . A comparable rate serious complication also report Baerveldt implant trabeculectomy antifibrotic agent retrospective study . The Tube Versus Trabeculectomy ( TVT ) Study multicenter randomize clinical trial compare safety efficacy tube shunt surgery use Baerveldt glaucoma implant trabeculectomy MMC 212 patient previous ocular surgery . Tube shunt surgery likely maintain IOP control avoid persistent hypotony reoperation glaucoma trabeculectomy MMC first year follow-up TVT Study . Tube shunt surgery trabeculectomy MMC produce similar IOP reduction 1 year , less need supplemental medical therapy follow trabeculectomy . There large number surgical complication first year follow-up TVT Study , transient self-limited . The incidence postoperative complication higher follow trabeculectomy MMC tube shunt surgery . However , severe complication result reoperation and/or vision loss occur similar frequency surgical procedure . Vision loss occur similar rate follow tube shunt surgery trabeculectomy MMC . Patients experience surgical complication great vision loss patient without complication . The result TVT Study suggest need compare safety efficacy tube shunt surgery trabeculectomy MMC patient low risk surgical failure , include eye without previous ocular surgery . The Primary Tube Versus Trabeculectomy ( PTVT ) Study multicenter randomize clinical trial similar design TVT Study . Enrolled patient randomized undergo placement 350mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implant trabeculectomy MMC . Baseline characteristic study population tabulate treatment group . Outcome discrimination two treatment group include IOP , surgical complication , visual acuity , visual field , glaucoma reoperation , need supplemental medical therapy . Data collect normal postoperative visit 1 day , 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 18 month , 2 year , 3 year , 4 year , 5 year surgery .</detailed_description>
